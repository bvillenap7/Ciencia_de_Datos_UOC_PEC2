Really large white object moving west to east at very high altitude;2001-03-25 11:05:00;6 minutes;Really large white object moving west to east at very high altitude On March 25, 2001, my wife and I were driving back to our homes from Prescott with our sunroof wide open.  The weather had a slight ground breeze and there was a slight haze in various areas of the skies due to airplane exhaust.  Other than that the view was well over 250 miles. I was sitting in the passenger seat and was commenting on the streaks of airplane contrails that were going east to west and vice-versa. I noticed a large 767 that was flying at about 40,000 ft going west to east just cross over and above a 737 going from east to west and was commenting about that also.  Then I noticed a larger than the 767 white object appearing to be stationary in the sky directly overhead.  I asked my wife to pull over and we observed the object for about 5 minutes as it slowly crawled across the sky at an estimated altitude of approx 50,000 to 60,000 ft.  It was not shining and was pure white.  It initially appeared to have small stubby like wings coming from the oval body but that was lost as the item was moving straight easterly from us. I noted the time of initial sighting @ 1105hrs and we were stopped by the side of the road for exactly 5 minutes watching the object.  We were stopped only 500 yards from the Prescott Airport (small planes only).  There is also a FAA VFR station approximately 10 miles NW of the airport.  There were a lot of commericial flights going east to west and vice-versa but those plane configurations were noticeable and identifiable.  I asked that we start driving North on Hwy 89 back to our homes at 1106 hrs and I watched the object as we progressed northward.  By the one mile mark past were we had stopped previously, the object not only had continued easterly but also had shifted to southernly view point.  That told me that the object was semi-stationary and since we were the ones moving that explained the object appearing to be more in the southern view. As we continued to drive north to our home, hoping to get a camera, the object was lost above one of the haze clouds from the lower flying aircraft.  I attempted to continue to track the projected course of the object but at approximately 1111 hrs I could no longer see any objects even in the clear patches.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
Craft went into cloud and disapeared.;2008-07-14 19:00:00;1 min;Craft went into cloud and disapeared. I was standing outside on my deck around 7PM. I noticed an unusual looking craft going north to south on 7/14. It was interesting because it was darker than most aircraft it didn’t have lights, and made no sound. It flew into a cloud and never came out. The cloud was positioned in such a way that I could not have missed an exit. It never did and the cloud dissipated and the craft was gone. If you have a logical explanation I’d love to hear it.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
7-10 orange orbs in northeast sky of Prescott, AZ, seen by civilians;2012-08-11 20:00:00;5 minutes;7-10 orange orbs in northeast sky of Prescott, AZ, seen by civilians After 8 p.m. Mountain Standard Time in Prescott, AZ, five family members, 4 of whom are adults, saw 7 to 10 fairly sizeable orange lights high in the sky heading from northeast to east.  They looked like orbs (one of us thought they looked wider at the leading edge than at the tail) and appeared in a kind of formation of some kind that almost looked like a constellation moving across the sky.  We did not hear any sound, and the leading orange lights disappeared as they reached the eastern sky, possibly in a downward direction, gone from sight by about 8:18 p.m.  We took video, and the lights must have been in the sky for at least 5 minutes that we saw.

Portal to alien planet or Alien base uncovered.;2013-10-19 07:30:00;5 minutes;Portal to alien planet or Alien base uncovered On Sat morning me and my wife saw another strange thing in the sunny clear sky.  We were on our way to Prescott AZ to meet some kids at 8:00 am 10.19.13.  We got off from I- 40 and went south on Hwy 89.  Halfway to Prescott in some hilly area and covered with small trees.  I had noticed a white disc object on the N. side of Granite Mt in the distance.  It looked like some smoke  that was coming out of the Mountain. Granite Mt still looked the same with rocks, it was light tan.  I also noticed that there was some flat areas in the valley, but to me it could have been gray smoke. I kept staring at the haze and Mts in the distance as we went around turns and up and down hills.  I then remembered that there are no mesa tops in Prescott and told Terrie to look at what I am seeing.  She confirmed that they are flat mesa's with protruding tops.  We saw two big ones and one small one very clear and square in the distance.  It also looked like some pointed poles below the tops, which were very pointed at each end.  They were all one med gray color and very large.! There was no shadows or land layers to see. As we drive about 67 mph, we see the left side of the middle mesa start to distort and change. The white disc is now vanished some how and the left areas are distorting and some things can be seen moving.  We lost view from trees and rock hill.  When we came out, we saw Granite Mt some other hills and Mts in the valley.  They had different shades of color and looked normal in the distance. They looked much smaller now with depth.  There is No white disc, No mesa's and No pointed poles any where to be seen.;34.5679554455445;-112.429568811881
