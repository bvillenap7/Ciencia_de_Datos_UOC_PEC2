Carousel in the Sky;2001-06-15 23:00:00;4 min;Carousel in the Sky It looked like a merry-go-round in the sky. The lights ranged from red to green and there was a strobing effect along the bottom. It didn't move like an aircraft, it was hovering but at a high altitude but then it descended. There was also some side to side motion then we lost view once a house got in the way, it was headed towards the mountains.;33.549;-111.9567
Beam of light in Paradise Valley.;2014-03-19 04:45:00;1 minute;Beam of light in Paradise Valley. It was before 5am, I was getting up for work.  I always look out my bedroom window at the beauty of the moon shining through the trees.   This morning I saw a beam of light.  This was between Camelback Mt & Mummy Mt.  I am not claiming it was UFO, but it was a strange time of day and just a beam of light.   It didn't flare out, just a straight beam of light shooting down from the heavens.   I didn't see any time of aircraft, just a beam of light from the sky.   I called my husband over to see it as my witness. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));33.549;-111.9567
Amber light flickered into bright position over Paradise Valley, joined by second amber light, faded and returned many times;2016-02-09 21:15:00;15 minutes;Amber light flickered into bright position over Paradise Valley, joined by second amber light, faded and returned many times Amber light flickered into bright position, remaining positioned rigidly over North Scottsdale (Paradise Valley), occasionally flickering out, then returning, and sometimes joined by identical amber light close by at approximately same altitude, neither light moving.   Light faded, then repeatedly returned over twenty minute period.  May have been farther off, perhaps over Phoenix, but from hillside position, appeared between Camelback Mountain and McDowell Mountains, over neighborhood.;33.549;-111.9567
Second night of two amber lights returning, flickering from exact fixed position.  This time I brought a second witness.;2016-02-10 10:45:00;5 minute;Second night of two amber lights returning, flickering from exact fixed position.  This time I brought a second witness. Second night in a row.  Two amber lights, hovering in absolute fixed position over Paradise Valley -- the northern neighborhoods of Scottsdale.  Bright, faintly flickering, staying absolutely fixed in position over the neighborhood.  I asked a fellow-student to come from the drafting studio and have a look.  He saw the lights as well.  Having watched the lights the night before for twenty minutes I predicted that the second light, the one that appeared to be a little closer to us, would blink out in a minute or two, followed by the first light about a minute later.  We speculated what it might be, pointing out how it couldn't be an airplane and was really bright for a drone (and the color would be hard to make, being that drones presently shine LED lights) and other theories.  Then the lights did just as I predicted.  My friend asked how I knew it would do that, I said that it did the same thing last night. Watched for their return for an hour.  Nothing.  Will watch tomorrow night, camera ready.  If they stay up there long enough, we'll chase them down with a car, get pictures under them.  This area has a long history with these lights.  They are back.  We'll try getting shots of them.;33.549;-111.9567
