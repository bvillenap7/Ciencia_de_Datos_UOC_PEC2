Lights After My girlfriend and I witnessed 17 -20 objects on the 14th of june in a string like formation. I jot my video camera out and went hunting for that same display. What I got was not the amazing 17-20 but, a good clear video (with nightshot) of some Lights 2 bright yellow\orange objects not moving after a while 2 more show up then one more but that one goes out. Now there is 4 in the air, 2 fall behind the Estrella Mtns. leaving 2 one goes out then re appeares above the other one. At this time a plane comes into the shot you can see the FAA blinking strobe lite (This Plane is not rhe sighting!!!) as the plane makes it way pass the objects the bottom light goes out. The last light stays on for a while then goes out. The entire duration took 9 minutes. The video will show that the plane had nothing to do with the sighting. Also the local news channel has done its own investagation on this. After talking to Luke Airforce base. Luke replied we had no planes dropping flares on thoes days in that area. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Witness states June 14th, and June 16th, as the date of the sighting.  PD));33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091
