Formation of various color lights over Phoenix area (Avondale/West Valley);2015-09-23 20:51:00;Several minutes;Formation of various color lights over Phoenix area (Avondale/West Valley) There were several lights of different colors moving in a formation.  They seemed much higher up than planes or jets would be.  They were moving eastward and passed directly overhead, moving fairly slowly--so slowly it took me a few seconds to realize they were even moving.  The formation was not tight.  There seemed to be quite a bit of space between the lights.  The formation was diamond shaped in the middle with one or two lights in the lead and one or two trailing behind the diamond.  One or two of the lights were green, at least one was red, at least one was blue, and the rest were white. Planes were in the area (which is normal with the airport being in the same metro area), so I was able to distinguish that it was not a light like typical lights from planes and that it was not moving like a plane.;33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091
