On June 19, around 4:55am driving on the loop 101 getting off at Grand exit #11 a flash lit up the sky and a bright green-blue light traviling in I believe and east to west direction on a downward trajectory.  It was extremly bright and appeared to be emitting sparks or debris.  Within a matter of seconds, the bright light flashed again and disappeared, leaving a vapor trail where it was shooting across the sky.   I thought about what this might have been for a few minutes and got on my cell phone to one of my work crew who was coming to work from the other direction on Grand.   As soon as he answered, we both started excitedly questioning and answering each other.  Another co-worker was in the car with him and saw it also.  They said at the time of the second flash they saw something that look like it was coming straight down like it was going to crash.  When we got to work its all we could talk about.  We are sure it wasn't a shooting star and we've never seen anything that looked like this before.  I thought it looked like a big, bright neon green light that faded into a blueish sliver and the flame color tail.  After the other two guys had seen the object, they had to drive by Luke Airbase, and ((name deleted)) told me that there appeared to be a lot of excitement and comotion going on in the base.  We we're talking on the cell.   I have never seen a ufo but have always dreamed of what it would be like.  I dont know if this will turn out to really be a ufo or not but after waiting till the next morn june, 20th I decided to make this report.   Man was I suprised to see all the sightings happening in my area this month.  Can't believe I havent heard about this on the news.;33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091
