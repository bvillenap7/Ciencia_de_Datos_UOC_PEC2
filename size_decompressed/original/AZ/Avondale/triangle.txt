The 2 red lights were tiny in comparison to aircraft, they were comparable to the night stars size.  As I walked out of the streetlights glare I then noticed the blue light at the top completing the triangle shape.  I immediately got overwhelmed with emotions and cried a bit cause I knew deep down it wasn't from this planet due to the sheer size of it, it was gigantic.  It was so silent and still cant wrap my head around if it was in our atmosphere or in our orbit.  It's been 3 days and I still cannot get over what I experienced, I feel lucky and incomplete at the same time.;33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091
