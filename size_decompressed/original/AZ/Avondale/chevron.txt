The ch;2004-03-23 20:45:00;5 Minutes;We were driving west on Buckey road crossing the Agua Fria River.  Noticed a chevron shaped formation of 3 amber bright lights.  The chevron was aligned east to west and pointing north.  The object seemed to be about 1.5 miles south and about 1500 feet up.  I stopped and got out to get a better view and could tell the lights were stationary in the sky.  The lights were the color of yellowish street lights, but were about three times as bright.  After a few minutes, the lights dimmed and blinked out from east to west one by one every 15 seconds until I could see no more. The never altered formation or even moved.  If I had held my fist out to measure the width, I would guess it to be about eight fists wide. ((NUFORC Note:  Please note other reports of yellow lights from AZ.  Our best guess is that they may be flares over military areas, but that is ONLY a guess.  PD));33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091
