A very bright stationary light,not an aircraft.;2001-01-25 19:00:00;2 hours;A very bright stationary light,not an aircraft. On the nights of Jan. 22 to Jan. 25th I observed low in the southwestern sky a bright light that hooverd about a mile high. It varied from two miles from my house to maybe ten miles Looking through binoculars it appears to be two lights which are very bright and white .Sometimes these lights criss-cross one another or appear to merge together.I can not tell if there is a craft attatched to these lights. Tonight I first saw the light about one mile from my house, about 30 minutes later I could barely see it . It appearred to be about ten, maybe twenty miles away. Then within five minutes it was within two miles from my house again. Around nine oclock at night the lights just dissapear. They do not appear to fade away into the horrizone, they just shut off instantly.Having been in Vietnam I know that these were not flairs.Also living within 5 miles of Luke Airforce Base the possibility that the lights could be from a helicopter occured to me,however two hours in one area four nights in a row would seem strange. In addittion the lights were to large to come from an aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus, but that is a guess.  The binoculars may not be perfectly columnated, which might explain the two images.   PD));33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091
seven or eight white and red lights wink out starting at outer edges till it was gone.;2002-01-25 20:45:00;4 seconds;seven or eight white and red lights wink out starting at outer edges till it was gone. While walking dogs, heading south I saw seven or eight lights in a row, some were red, but mostly white. They winked out 2 at a time starting at the outer edges till there was one left and then it winked out. The width of the lights looked like it was atleast twice as wide as an airplane. It was headed south toward Estrella Mountains. I see airplanes constantly flying in this area and know that couldn't have been a plane.It was amazing. The altitude appeared lower than the usual planes flying by. I saw this just over the roof of the houses 1/16th of a mile south of me. Object looked like it was about two miles away possibly.;33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091
A bright light , on a sunny day, suddenly appeared at about 45 degrees from the horizon headed west and suddenly vanished.;2004-03-25 15:15:00;5 seconds;A bright light , on a sunny day, suddenly appeared at about 45 degrees from the horizon headed west and suddenly vanished. Driving southbound on 107th Dr. at approximately 3:15PM an intense light appeared about 45 degrees from the horizon appearing to move at a very high rate of speed.  It seemed to be first coming toward us since it got larger, then moved directly west.  It seemed to just appear, move across about 45 degrees of sky and then instead of disappearing in the distance, it just vanished.;33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091

Sighting of a silent bright glowing red orb over Avondale, AZ.;2013-03-15 23:00:00;5 minutes;Sighting of a silent bright glowing red orb over Avondale, AZ. Last night (03-15-2013) I saw from my backyard a glowing red orb hovering for several minutes in the sky just northwest of my home in Avondale AZ.  It was a very clear night. We live near an airport and see air traffic constantly so all of us can easily spot a plane or helicopter and even blimps day or night.  This was definitely none of the above.  The orb was completely silent.  After hovering for a few minutes it began to move east very slowly then faded and disappeared.  Shortly afterward a helicopter came over the house and circled over the area where the object had been.  Since it was after 11 P.M. we were unable to see what type of helicopter it was.  This is the second red orb I’ve seen in my lifetime.  I had a much closer encounter with one in 1998 or 99’ in California that lasted about 10 minutes.

There were 2 flickering bright orange colored lights traveling from S to S.  I could not identify any shape.  No a/c lights.;2015-12-24 22:30:00;3 minutes;There were 2 flickering bright orange colored lights traveling from south to north.  I could not identify any shape.  There were no anti-collision lights visible.   The one object in the lead was moving faster than the other and picking up speed until it suddenly vanished.  The second object moved at a constant speed and started to fade out when it went up through the clouds.   These were not the flares sometimes seen in the southwest valley dropped by the military for training purposes as they were climbing in altitude quickly.   Skies were partly cloudy and cloud base was approximately 5000 to 7000 ft.  There was no sound present.   I shot a video with my Samsung Note 3 but had trouble getting the phone to focus before the objects disappeared.;33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091
After filing an initial report I went back outside and to my surprise I saw another object with the same orange/salmon flickering.;2015-12-24 23:38:00;1 minute;After filing an initial report, I went back outside and to my surprise I saw one more object with the same orange/salmon flickering light.  This one was moving southwest to northeast at a constant steady speed.  The object was almost straight above slightly to the west out of the moons light.  No sound was present again and altitude was hard to determine as there were no clouds in the object's immediate area.  This time however just before the object disappeared the light changed color.  It went from bright orange/salmon to deep dark red back to orange/salmon then finished up deep dark red then vanished.  The time for each color change was about a second.;33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091

Orangey-yellow ORBS at the Phoenix Raceway - April 2, 2016;2016-04-02 21:00:00;1 hour;Orangey-yellow ORBS at the Phoenix Raceway - April 2, 2016 At Phoenix International Raceway after the nighttime Indy races on Saturday, April 2, 2016, we all saw three bright orangey-yellow orbs flying low over the parking lots and race track, moving in separate directions.  One flew straight up into the sky and disappeared, while two Orbs stayed to linger longer and everyone in the parking lots trying to leave after the races saw these orbs for about an hour.  No noise was observed at all.  One Orb stayed in one spot for long time then, like a light switch, turned off!  Most exciting end to a weekend of the first Indy car races at Phoenix International Raceway.;33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091
3 bright orange lights in the Avondale, AZ, area.;2016-11-06 00:30:00;10 minutes;3 Bright orange lights in the Avondale, AZ, area. It was approx. 12:30am when I got up to closed my dining room window, which faces the Estrella mountains, I looked out and I saw 3 bright orange lights, they were not moving, they were in a shape of a triangle (one single one on top and 2 underneath, forming a triangle)   I believe I even saw what I thought was a plane fly behind these orange lights.  I went to wake up my boyfriend and when he got up to see what I was talking about, the orange lights faded away one by one.  These lights were orange, very bright and very clear.;33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091
Large orange/reddish light high in the sky, moves horizontal and fades away.;2017-02-08 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;Large orange/reddish light high in the sky, moves horizontal and fades away. Between 21:30-21:45 tonight I witnessed one large orange light moving in a straight horizontal line.  It was in the Northeast sky high up next to Ursa Major at that time in the evening sky.  It slowly moved in a southwesterly direction.   At first I assumed it was an airplane or helicopter of some kind, but as it continued towards my direction I could hear absolutely no sound coming from it.  The light was changing from an orange to reddish orange color and the light had star like shaped beams, similar to what commercial airplane lights look like when making their decent, or a headlight.  It was incredibly bright, and larger than any other stars in the sky.   I watched it for close to 5 minutes before I asked a family member to come outside and see it. We stood together watching it for another 2-3 minutes when it stopped moving and stayed stationary, bobbing around a little before fading into nothing.  I could see no other signs of aircraft other than the one light.  There were no other lights or air craft in the area at the time.  I stayed outside looking for it for another 5-10 minutes and it did not return.;33.4539381818182;-112.330290909091
