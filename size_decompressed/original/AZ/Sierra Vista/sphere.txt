Round bright object chase.;1972-06-01 22:00:00;10 minutes;Round bright object chase. I was stationed at Ft. Huachuca AZ in the Electronic Warfare School. My wife and myself (I was 18 at the time) was driving outside the Fort. We used to drive to a place where we used to meet friends. Mostly a 'hotrod' thing that kids do.. I don't recall the road now, it was a while ago. It went to a shallow river/stream in the desert where the soldiers would meet to party under a bridge. When we were about 3 or 4 miles outside of town, we saw a round bright object crest the hill behind us at about 100 yards. At first I thought it was a truck but as it appeared it was very low to the ground (20-40 feet at most..) following the road to the side. I saw it first in the driver side mirror. Then I turned around and saw it. The object was very bright. It was large about 50 feet in diameter. It was hard to tell exactly how large as it was so bright. It lite up the road. The light was a 'white' light. Very brilliant. I could not make out any detail as it glowed so bright. My wife yelled to me to get out of there. She kept saying 'Go..go!'..I speeded up and the object came closer. We went to a side road and I spun the car around and the object went into the desert as if to cut us off. I did a u-turn on the dirt road and and headed back in the opposite direction to the Fort. We were both shaken up. I had never seen anything like it before. I did not tell anyone as they would not believe us. What I remember most that frightened me is the feeling I got. I can't explain it, but I felt it was 'hunting us'..maybe the wrong word but I knew that I could not stop and had to keep driving. I do not want my name used or my identity revealed.

Two blinking red orbs blinking in no pattern both close together then moving farther apart.;2019-10-14 19:35:00;35 minutes;Two blinking red orbs blinking in no pattern both close together then moving farther apart. Saw 2 blinking red orbs that remained stationary.  One orb would blink and then the other would blink but there was no pattern the orbs appeared to spread further apart and then they would come very close together and then only 1 orb would be blinking.  Then the other orb would become visible again and they would both be blinking.  Again no pattern was noted.  Then both orbs shifted to a higher and more westerly level in the sky and then returned to the previous position,  They once again came very close together and then there was only 1 orb visible still blinking red.  This was recorded on my cell phone.;31.537104;-110.268038666667
