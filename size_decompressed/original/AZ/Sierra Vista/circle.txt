It was twilight,around 6:00pm.First a friend and I saw a small bright white light moving across the sky quickly.  I thought it to be a satellite at first,until it did a very quick zig zag.  Than it was a dark red disk that huvered in the sky.  I could see that in the center was a black dot surrounded by a dark red circle surrounded by a black cirle,which was surrounded by another dark red circle,which was perferated in 4 equal parts.  It just sat there for about a minute and a half before turning back into a bright white light again and zipped out of sight horizontally!;31.537104;-110.268038666667
Noticed a bright white circle (reflected sunlight) appearing from the NE on a SE trajectory. Alt. lower than the ISS when it appear.;2013-10-19 13:40:00;20 seconds;Noticed a bright white circle (reflected sunlight) appearing from the NE on a SE trajectory. Altitude lower than the ISS when it appears.  Straight speed similar to a satellite but much lower and brighter.  Object continued on course until disappearing from view in the southern distance.  No contrails, definitely not any type of common aircraft.  Both jets, small fixed wing and drones fly in or through this area.;31.537104;-110.268038666667
3-5 craft with white and red lights flying erratic patterns over sierra vista / tombstone area;2017-05-27 20:00:00;2-3 hours;3 to 5 craft with white and red lights flying erratic patterns over sierra vista / tombstone area It was shortly after sundown that my GF and I were sitting on my back patio, relaxing after dinner.  As I have a habit of doing, I looked up at the sky (I enjoy sky watching) and noticed several objects to the north east that were moving.  At first I thought there was a plane and the other objects were stars.   After watching for several minutes I noticed there was a larger BRIGHT object and 5 smaller objects and the smaller ones were moving rather erratically.  I mentioned it to my GF who also confirmed that she saw it.  While she was watching I went inside and brought out my binoculars to get a closer look.  They were very high in the sky. At this point, 2 of the 5 smaller craft had left the area, but 3 of the smaller ones were still there.  The larger bright object had left also.   Once we had the binoculars, we could see that the 3 smaller objects that were moving in what resembled figure 8 patterns but still very erratic, were circular.  There was a pulsing red light in the center and a white light that ran around the outside in a clockwise motion.   This continued for at least 2 hours (from 8pm to 10pm), and we went to bed, while this was still going on.   These craft did not return the following or subsequent evenings.
