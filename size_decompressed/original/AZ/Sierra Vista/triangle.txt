Silent delta wing aircraft;1984-06-01 18:00:00;5 minutes;Silent delta wing aircraft I decided to file this report after hearing you on C2CAM this week.  Admittedly I’m skeptical, who knows.  This is a report of an old sighting, 1984.  While driving between Tombstone and Sierra Vista, Arizona at approximately 6 PM, dusk, headed SW, we saw a large black/dark delta wing object hovering/moving at a slow rate of speed, traveling West. It was traveling at perhaps 1000 feet and was at least a few hundred feet in size. Though my assumption was that this was a military aircraft, it was absolutely silent, quite large, and left our view after only a very few minutes.  There were no lights, no vapors/exhaust or other signs of propulsion, etc.     Living near an Army base, Ft. Huachuca, my assumption was and has been this was a military aircraft.  However, this was 1984, a silent craft, and vanished from sight.  At the time of the sighting both me and my wife were in our late 20s.  We’re both professional (physician and nurse), and no mental illness (&#9786)  I’ve always just assumed it was military, but who knows.  June 22, 2012;31.537104;-110.268038666667
Triangle-shaped, illuminated object flies fast and silent from north to south across sky;2012-10-20 20:07:00;5-10 seconds;triangle-shaped, illuminated object flies fast and silent from north to south across sky 3 illuminated triangles as a part of a big triangle (not with lights but like the entire shapes were... glowing?) it went from the north part of the sky southward and then something broke away from the triangle formation and flew directly west while the other remained on a southward flight path.   It flew almost as fast as a shooting star in perfect silence.;31.537104;-110.268038666667
