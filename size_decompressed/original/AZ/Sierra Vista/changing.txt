Bright chemtrail or similar during early morning phenomenon.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a contrail, not chemtrail.  PD));2006-07-12 03:45:00;1 hour;Bright chemtrail or similar during early morning phenomenon started seeing a very fine line in the sky towards SE approx. 03:45.   By 04:00 the line has formed quite a distance with and still very fine.   By 04:10 line has made a few turns and the tail end where it started has begun to swell. line stayed very bright during this whole event.   By 04:20 it started to split in 2 separate trailing lines.  By 04:45 the trailing lines stopped and slight amount of light begins to reflect from the horizon as sun began to rise.   There is a similar report that has been filed on this same date and approx time from Tucson, AZ, with the same object description.   I have a few snapshots stored.  Video had been taken as well but camera had been lost so the only remaining credible evidence I have are the pictures. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a contrail, not chemtrail.

Shape shifting object  looked like it had a face;2015-05-09 22:00:00;45 minutes;Shape shifting object  looked like it had a face. Strange object that changed shapes and colors  Twice it appeared to be two object, like a shadow of itself and I know it wasn't glare because my son saw it without the camera  The creepiest thing about this object is that it appeared to have a face.
