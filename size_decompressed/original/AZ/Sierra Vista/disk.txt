Small, distant disk shaped object with red light in night sky moving very fast;2007-02-15 19:00:00;3 minutes;Small, distant disk shaped object with red light in night sky moving very fast I had just arrived at a party and was approaching the house in the front yard around 7pm and saw a very small disk up in the night sky.  A red light was emanating from the center of the bottom, almost covering the whole bottom surface which was dark grey.  The object was moving very fast across the sky, and was far enough away to be about the size of a pea.  It was clearly not an airplane because of its speed and I was also able to see the disk shape.  It was making a very soft buzzing noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));31.537104;-110.268038666667
UFO saucer seen flying over Sierra Vista, Arizona;2009-03-27 13:30:00;2 min;UFO saucer seen flying over Sierra Vista, Arizona I just got a call from my brother a truck driver that he just saw a UFO. He was driving from Sierra Vista, Az. north bound towards I-10 when he noticed 2 cars pulled off to the right and other cars pulling off on the side of the highway. He saw them looking up into the sky and so he did the same and he saw a big saucer shape craft fying from east to west. Not sure how high it was but a little lower than what a jet liner would fly. He said it was metalic color and didnt really see any lights on it or flashing but that is was about the size of a quarter or so and it was moving when he saw it and it disappeared over the mountains/hills of south Tucson. HE said it was moving much faster than a jet liner. There is a base near by called Fort Hachuca. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There is an object in the sky that we have confirmed cannot be an aircraft because it is hovering.;2011-12-25 21:05:00;continuing;There is an object in the sky that we have confirmed cannot be an aircraft because it is hovering. Christmas 2011 around 9 pm we identified an object in the sky that we first assumed was a bright star.  Our house faces south, and this object was in the southeastern sky.  We did not find it unusual because we thought it might be a plane or helicopter.  After watching the sky for over 20 minutes, the object did not move.  This object also flickered in a number of colors (blue, green, yellow, orange, red, and a bright white light flashing occasionally from the right, bottom corner of the object. My husband and I saw it first, then we asked the rest of our family to confirm what we saw.  All members of my family including, my mother-in-law, my sister-in-law, my three children, my daughters boyfriend, and two nieces witnessed the exact same thing.  The object appears to be a line that is flashing left to right the multiple colors and repeating the sequence continually. We are normal working americans and students of public schools. We have also posted on Facebook for all people to see. Thank you.;31.537104;-110.268038666667
