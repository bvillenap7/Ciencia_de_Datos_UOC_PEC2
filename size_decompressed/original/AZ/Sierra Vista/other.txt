Daytime transparent U.F.O. with one light on end of craft.;2011-10-14 17:00:00;5-10 MIN.;Daytime transparent U.F.O. with one light on end of craft. I'm a delivery driver in the food industry.   I was going north bound on Hwy 90 leaving Sierra Vista,AZ.  I was between Huachuca City & I-17 & hwy 90 interchange when I saw a clear object like a long thin wing with a bright light on the far right end of the wing.  There was no fuselage or thick like body.  It was traveling northeast direction.  This happened around 4-6pm during the day.  It was a clear sky with no clouds.;31.537104;-110.268038666667
