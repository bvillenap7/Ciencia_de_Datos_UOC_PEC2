The lights were directly west, immediatly in front of the mountain about 3/4 up the height of the mountain.  They were stationary for about two hours the moved slighly north.   We looked with binoculars but could not see any thing more than the two lights.  The aerostat was up that night and was beside us to the south and plainly visable with its flashing white light.   We observed the lights from our porch until we went to bed about 2300.  I thought I could see at times a white beam of light emitting from the red light.  My son thinks the beams might have been only glare because we could not see them when viewing through the binoculars.  We both wear glasses.   There was no other aerial activity at that time.  We have had other experiences before but never have  told anyone.  The  thing  that upset my family is that when we returned inside and  got busy doing other things I  suddenly had a severe nosebleed.   We are leaving here late Saturday night moving to another state so we cannot be contacted by e mail or phone after Sat.;31.537104;-110.268038666667

A very fast craft turned 90 degrees without slowing or banking, traveling apprx mach one at 20,000 ft.;2005-11-22 23:00:00;7 seconds;A very fast craft turned 90 degrees without slowing or banking, traveling apprx mach one at 20,000 ft. The object was traveling in a northwesterly direction at approx 20,000 feet, at a speed over double a commercial jet, then it changed direction at a 90 degree turn instantly towards the east and excellerated until it was out of sight!  The sky was clear, great visibility. USAF testing maybe?  To further explain, the lite ball didn't turn, bank or slow, it was like you draw a line on a paper and then turn right,like the letter L!  This wasn't a jet, no noise what so ever emagine a huge spot lite on the front of a very, very fast craft is what i saw.. I retired five years ago from 45 years in the marine and aircraft industries.
