Large amber light turns into 5 and slowly disappears;2016-11-16 22:37:00;2 minutes;large amber light turns into 5 and slowly disappears On 11/10/2016 at approximately 22:37 hours, I was on a high look out point near a mountain, 15 miles north of Benson, AZ, (south east of Tucson, AZ) looking at stars, the moon and other objects in the sky with high powered telescope.  When we decided to take a break to eat from viewing, we sat down and were looking to the North East sky. After about 5 or so minutes, we saw a single bright above average size light in the sky, the light was changing from white, to a reddish, to amber color.  It was a continuous light, but its light source seemed unstable. ( kinda flickering)  As I was looking at this, I said to girl with me, while she was in mid sentence, What is that?  I thinks a UFO.  She started to discredit me, but as soon as she looked at it, she went dead silent and just watched. The one light almost grew and then separated into five separate lights close together and all of the same color and unstable.  These 5 lights stayed in a line the whole time and didn't ascend or descend (they never moved from their position in the sky). After about 30 seconds of this, the lights started to chase each other like Christmas lights do. first it chased forward 3 times and backward 3 times.  Then stopped and then one by one each light when out and never comeback on again. The sky was 100% clear, we both looked at each other and both agreed it was unusual. After the sighting 2 odd things happened... all noise in the area crickets, coyotes, desert frogs (we were near a small river) and anything else stopped making noise and her and I both had a very uneasy feeling set in, almost felt liking being watched. Once that feeling set in, we cut our night short and left to go home. While looking on this website, I noticed several sightings in the phoenix/glendale area and another area south of phoenix with many sightings in the past 3 weeks.  several of those sightings I read seemed similar to my event;31.9883;-110.2941
