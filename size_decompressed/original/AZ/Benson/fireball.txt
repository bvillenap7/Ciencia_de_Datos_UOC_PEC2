I glanced up to the sky to see a very bright light surrounded by a firey glow flash across the sky from due east to due west and, after maybe two to three seconds, it vanished from site.

This light ball was very, very bright and appeared to be much lower in the sky than the usual shooting stars I normally see after it is completely dark outside.  No sound was present.;31.9883;-110.2941
