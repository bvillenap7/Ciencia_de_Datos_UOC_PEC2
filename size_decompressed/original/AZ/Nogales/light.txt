Four orange/red orbs seen in Nogales, AZ sky.;2013-11-20 21:10:00;60 seconds;Four orange/red orbs seen in Nogales, AZ sky Observed three red/orange lights traveling North in the Western sky.  They disappeared and then reappeared.   Two seemed to join, then separated, appeared again and then the group was joined by a fourth.   Was this a UFO or pieces of the Australian satellite that reentered our atmosphere last week?   A beautiful scary and exciting moment.   Over so soon, for trees blocked my view.;31.3854588235294;-110.948270588235

The lights appeared to be hoovering over a ridge. No engine noise or airplane noises were heard. The lights just seemed to vanish as we came around a bend in the road.;31.3854588235294;-110.948270588235

Flickering light stops in mid air and starts to shine really bright and ultimately disappears.;2020-12-08 18:30:00;3-5m minutes;Flickering light stops in mid air and starts to shine really bright and ultimately disappears. Went outside and saw a flickering light (red and white) moving from east to west pretty slowly when all of the sudden it stopped in mid air and the light got really bright (white) for about a minute, then it started moving back the direction it came from until it faded away. I can say the aircraft was flying relatively low and the movement was not that of a plane.;31.3854588235294;-110.948270588235
