3 White Orbs and bands of 8 Red Lights flash on and off over Queen Creek, AZ;2009-11-16 19:00:00;30 minutes;3 White Orbs and bands of 8 Red Lights flash on and off over Queen Creek, AZ Three bright orbs in a line were observed in an area of the sky that is normally a part of the Mesa Gateway Airport southern landing approach. The 3 orbs initially appeared to be in a line that was slightly angled as if attached to a gigantic triangle/wedge suspended in the sky. Within seconds, the lights blinked off, one by one from the left to the right, in the same fashion as the Phoenix Lights over South Mtn. These were not aircraft lights. There was no sound and the sky was cloudless.These lights were very large comparatively and only white, with the estimated distance away of 3/4 mile and very, very low. 5 minutes later an arc of approximately 8 red(only)lights displayed on from left to right, held for a second and went off altogether. The position in the sky was farther away and to the southeast approx 5-7 miles. This action was observed using binoculars and re-occurred 3 more times in different areas of the southeastern sky, too far apart to be a! prank. These were not flares or fireworks or any known craft.The distance of the last red display was approx. 20 miles away, traveling southeast over Pinal County, AZ.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
Multiple point source lights, Very intense RGB color spectrum.  Some would wink on and off, some in a pattern, Pattern moved across sky;2015-12-22 19:15:00;10 minutes;Multiple point source lights, Very intense RGB color spectrum.  Some would wink on and off, some in a pattern.  Pattern moved across sky Viewing to the North from our backyard.  Multiple lights (100+) drifted in from East (Apache Junction)  Lights were intense RGB with mostly Blue and Green and BG metallic with less Red and orange.  Lights were of different sizes.  Light field would form patterns and change directions.  Estimated area from farthest lights apart 1 to 1.5 miles.  We have some video fro iPhone but it does not recreate the intensity or show all the smaller points of light.  Video does seem to show a spherical edge to the front of the mass of lights not initially seen by naked eye.  Light pattern morphed into shapes such as a salamander and angel fish shapes. Individual lights would turn on and off and some would strobe in changing patterns. Initially thought fireworks  but after a second realized not possible.  Second choice was Northern Lights.  This did not have the haze field of the borealis but different points.  Don't remember if points would change color, need to review video;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
Red/orange object--circle to chevron shape with lights hovering overhead with no sound;2017-02-04 17:53:00;8 minutes;Red/orange object - circle to chevron shape with lights hovering overhead with no sound Reddish-orange circular object seen hovering in sky over the San Tan Mountains.  Object moved closer in the sky, and appeared to be a chevron shape with red lights.  Hovered over head and made no sound at all.  I took a photo of the original red object and strange gray shape is seen to the right of the object as well.  As  object came closer and lower in the sky, a second red light appeared in the sky directly behind and to the right of original object.   Original red object was hovering directly over my aunt and I...we were on horseback so it was difficult to keep looking without straining my neck.  I was treating her to a birthday sunset ride and she said that my uncle would be watching the sunset and surely taking photos so we stopped watching and rode off.  My family back at the barn noticed nothing  but we're facing a different area of the sky. My aunt is a retired ((deleted)) manager now living in North Carolina.  I am a licensed ((deleted)) in Gilbert, Arizona.  I ride horses in this area often.  On October 25, 2016, at 18:35 I saw a line of moving lights in this exact area of the sky.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
Shape shifting ball in sky, Black ball with legs flew on neighbors roof fast and ran across roof, Shape shifting saucer or saucers;2021-08-03 05:13:00;2 minutes;Shape shifting ball in sky, Black ball with legs flew on neighbors roof fast and ran across roof, Shape shifting saucer or saucers On 8/3/21 At 4:45 am I started videoing something bright in the South sky that was rotating, changing colors size and shapes. I heard an aircraft from the West and I look and there was a flying saucer and a black ball with legs landed on my neighbors roof and ran until the tree blocked my vision. The saucer had went more South and was closer to the rotating thing. The black ball thing with legs appeared again and disappeared. The saucer turned and headed West. I have a video of all of this and screen shots.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
