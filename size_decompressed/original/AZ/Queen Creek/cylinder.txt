Red and Blue lights close to object flashing.  Video Taped At about 3:00 am, 18 October 2011 I witnessed a blinking object above me.  I thought it was a high flying plane but then noticed it was stationary.  It stayed in the same place for about 12 minutes before I decided to video the object with my cell phone.  It would flash periodically, in a random sequeance.   There were other lights around the object one flashing red the other a deep blue light.  After filming I froze the video and extracted each frame where the object had flashed.   UFO is all I can think of.  I have some VERY interesting pictures and video and would like it analyzed with better equipment.  The object has mass and is not a star or planet.  It is communicating with lights around it. The video is to big to send by email therefore I will send the extracted frames for you to anaylize.   Thank you. CWO2 ((name deleted)) (Retired).;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
