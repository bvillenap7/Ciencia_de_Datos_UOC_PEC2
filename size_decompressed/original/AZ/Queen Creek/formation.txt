String of green Christmas lights in the western sky over Phoenix.;2015-12-22 19:30:00;5+ minutes;String of green &quotChristmas lights&quot in the western sky over Phoenix. As we were heading west at roughly 1930 Arizona time, my husband commented on how pretty the planes looked lined up for landing.  I looked and noticed there were way too many planes than normal.  You can usually see about 5-6 stacked up for landing at PHX.   There were about 20 that looked like a string of green Christmas light that were dragged across the sky going from west to northwest.  They were all blinking but not regularly.  No noise.   They eventually spread out and faded to the north after about 5 mins.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
Snake like formation with hundreds of lights sighted above Queen Creek, AZ at 8pm on 12/18/17.;2017-12-18 20:00:00;30 minutes;Snake like formation with hundreds of lights sighted above Queen Creek, AZ at 8pm on 12/18/17 Hundreds of lights in snake formation traveling above the planes that were coming in to land 3 miles north at Williams-Gateway Airport.   Formation headed from north to south then straight up.  Each light of snake like formation was at least as bright as a plane's lights, some lights beamed steady white, and some blue blinked, and was at least a mile long.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
