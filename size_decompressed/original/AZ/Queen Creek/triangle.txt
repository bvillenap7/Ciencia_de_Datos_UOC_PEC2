UFO Sighting Over Southeast Phoenix In 2005.;2005-10-24 22:30:00;5 minutes;UFO Sighting Over Southeast Phoenix In 2005. UFO Sighting over southeast Phoenix, 10-24-05   I am writing this as a matter of record as to what I witnessed in the sky over the San Tan Heights area, southeast of Phoenix, Arizona, on the evening of October 24th, 2005. It was a cool cloudless and moonless night. My wife and I went out on the back patio around 9 PM to enjoy a fire and stargaze. After seeing the occasional shooting-star we decided to call it a night and head back inside about 10:30 PM. As I took one last look at the sky an object caught my eye. At first I wasn’t sure that I was actually looking at something, but as my eyes began to adjust I could see that there was something there and it was hovering or moving very, very slow. What immediately alarmed me was that this flying craft made no noise on a night that was so quiet that you could have heard a car engine a mile away let alone the engine of a large aircraft. I grabbed my wife and asked her if she saw what I was looking at and after pointing it out she saw it too. When I first spotted the object it was between my location and the southern end of the San Tan Mountains, about a mile and away hovering at what I would guess about a 1000 feet high. As it began to slowly move in a southerly direction I got a better glimpse of this object. It had no running lights and was dark in color and I could see its shape and size silhouetted against the starry sky. The object did seem to produce a light greenish auora at times, but it was very faint. It was the biggest flying object that I have ever seen, much larger than a 747 and shaped like a boomerang.  My wife and I observed the object for several minutes before it disappeared over the southern horizon. It spooked us both and she still doesn’t like talking about it. I went online to several UFO reporting websites and filed a report with one, mainly to see if I would get a response from someone else in the area that might have seen this thing too. The funny thing is a few days later my posting of the sighting had been removed for no apparent reason. At the time I knew nothing about the mass sighting over Phoenix in 1997, but after some research and hearing accounts of what people saw that night, I would say that we observed was something very similar to what they did. A giant, silent flying, wing like object.  I know some time has passed since this UFO sighting occured, but I feel obligated to report none the less.  I still gives me the chills to think about it...;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
