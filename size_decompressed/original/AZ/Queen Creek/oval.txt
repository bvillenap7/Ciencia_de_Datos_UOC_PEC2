Daytime sighting in arizona.;2007-02-21 12:15:00;30 seconds;Daytime sighting in arizona Was driving down hunt highway towards ellsworth rd & the day was clear & i always glance at the mountains while i drive by there. Its a beautiful view (the san tan mountains)  Today i saw over the mountain of the saloon restaurant, an oval shaped disc traveling away from the mountain, as i looked again it seemed to move alot faster westward.  As soon as i pulled the car over i saw it disapear up & gone within 1 second.  Incredible.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343

Then out of the east came a large ball of light. It had a long tail on it and was moving very fast in a straight line. It was about the size of my thumb nail and had a width of my thumb and pointer finger span. The tail was a deep turqouise closest to the oval and faded as it went down. It also seemed to be radiating a halo around the entire object. It lasted a total of 3-4 seconds and was moving faster than I could take a picture, I had my camera by my side too and wish I could have captured it. It was like nothing I seen before and I've seen my share of metors and metor showers. The direction and speed also ruled out the possibility of it being a firework.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
