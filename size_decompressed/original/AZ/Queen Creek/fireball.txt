Falling green fireball.;2014-04-12 20:00:00;1-5 seconds;Falling green fireball I saw a bright green light, which appeared to be like a fireball fall from maybe 100-300 feet in the air.   It appeared suddenly, and did not appear to fall from a high distance like a meteor, and appeared to fall close to Ocotillo Road near Meridian Road in Queen Creek.  Multiple drivers in front of me tapped their brakes, probably unsure as to what just happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Unidentified balls of light flying over Queen Creek, AZ that were not meteorites or planes.;2020-03-01 19:00:00;2 minutes;Unidentified balls of light flying over Queen Creek, AZ that were not meteorites or planes. There was one initial ball of orange and red light that went in a straight line across the night sky approximately four or so miles high in altitude.  The ball of light did not leave any kind of trail behind it and remained circular the entire time.  There was absolutely no noise and it did not blink like a plane would.  The speed was too fast for an airplane at its altitude, even the fighter jets we watch due to luke air base.  This was not a meteorite as it was too slow and the light was not correct, leaving no tail.  The trajectory was flat, not varying in height.  There was also no variance in speed.  The ball of light dimmed after approximately 30 seconds then blinked out well before reaching the horizon. Right after the initial ball of light disappeared two more followed approximately 18 seconds later.  These two were exactly the same as the first and were side by side along the exact same path and altitude.  17 seconds after the two balls of light the fourth and final one came into view and again followed the same exact path at the same altitude. Everyone of them disappeared in the same exact location well before getting out of viewing range. They were all the exact same color, orange and red mix, which is why they looked like flying perfectly round balls of flame. Again there was absolutely no 'tail' and couldn't have been a meteorite. As a naturalist in a different state for over a decade I can attest it was something I had never before seen even after many hundreds of star gazing programs.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
