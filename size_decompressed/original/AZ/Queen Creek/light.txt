Circular Bright light;2004-06-01 23:00:00;5 minutes;Circular Bright light A friend and I had just gotten off work, and went back to his parents house to swim.  It was in a newly developed area, with very little light pollution, and the sky and stars were very visible.  We had been in the pool for about 10 minutes, and there had been a light breeze, and a little background noise, like crickets and dogs and such.  Out of no where it became eerily silent, no breeze, no sound, no waves in the pool, not even a ripple and a very bright white light appeared over us, maybe 200 feet up.  It was circular in shape, and had no sound.  The light very slowly descended and became blinding, it was like being in a room with white paint and white lights, and the atmosphere felt magnetic. I remember this lasting for maybe 5 minutes, and the light became a small circle, maybe 20 ft in diameter, and was just out of reach over head, and shot straight up and out of sight, without a sound, a breeze, a wind, nothing. I drove a Jeep at the time with no top, and! looked up the entire drive home. I don’t remember being in the pool that long, but I left straight away and the clock read 2:15 AM.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343

Three lights, fairly close to the ground, evenly spread at a slight angle, started to turn and then vanished.;2007-04-03 20:00:00;5 or 6 seconds;Three lights, fairly close to the ground, evenly spread at a slight angle, started to turn and then vanished. I was driving Eastbound down Ocotillo Road in Queen Creek, AZ (a SE mostly rural suburb of Phoenix) at about 8 PM on April 3, 2007, when I looked up into the jet black night sky (in the East, Northeast sky) and saw three yellowish-gold lights, close together, in a straight line, on about a 15 to 20 degree angle. I instantly thought to myself why is a plane flying so low over here.  It was coming pretty much toward me.  It started to turn to the left (to the NW) and then completely vanished into thin air. I saw the lights for a total of about 5 to 6 seconds before they disappeared.  I then continued to try to look while I drove for some sign of these lights. It really freaked me out.  At first I thought it was a plane, but there was no way it could have just vanished like it did. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous provides e-mail address only.

2 golden orbs near SanTan Mtn Regional Park;2007-04-04 20:55:00;1 minute;2 golden orbs near SanTan Mtn Regional Park On Hunt Hwy, approx Power Rd, headed east: in southeast sky, between Hunt Hwy and San Tan Mtn Regional Park.  Golden orb 'appeared' in sky (saw no ascension, etc.), then split into two.  Then, one orb (more easterly) disappeared, shortly followed by the  second orb.  Could have been flares(?).  Some cloud cover, but plane in sky at same time frame moved from north of Hunt Hwy to south of Hunt into same vicinty.  This plane did not disappear.  Orbs were quite bright, appearing at lower altitude than plane. Further inspection of sky revealed section free of cloud cover, where we believe we saw the orbs disappear.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
We saw a stationary glowing ball in South Eastern sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2011-09-18 06:00:00;40 min;We saw a stationary glowing ball in South Eastern sky. At around 6:00 Sunday morning, my husband and I were arriving home after work when we noticed the yellowish-white ball in the sky to the East. It didn’t seem to move just hover in the same spot my husband called the Sheriffs Dept.  They went out to look and returned to say it was a hot air balloon and the morning sun was reflecting off it. But after watching it for about 40 min. we realized it was no hot air balloon.  It would have moved at least a little.  We tried to contact Fox news but it was too early to get anyone to check it out.  We finally gave up and went to bed when I woke it was gone.  I have pictures and video on my Flip, but they don’t do it justice. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));33.2487000000001;-111.6343
Light appearing two nights in the same week during December in Queen Creek, AZ Identical in occurence.;2013-12-23 20:30:00;3 minutes;Light appearing two nights in the same week during December in Queen Creek, AZ Identical in occurance. On December 23rd, 2013 at approx. 20:30pm a red light was seen hovering over the southwesterly sky directly over the San Tan Mountains south of Queen Creek, AZ. Object moved at an impressively slow speed,  and then appeared to hover for about 45 to 50 seconds before slowly dimming and then disappearing or no longer visible. Other air traffic was visible with strobe lights and audible.  This object was silent, the light was monochromatic without strobe, and its motions were smooth and consistent in their path. Weather condition: Clear sky, moon was in the low eastern sky, cool night. Other air traffic in the area. On December 25th at about the same time in the same location the light reappeared.  It first appeared low over San Tan Mountain, about 35 degrees moving very slowly in an upwardly curving trajectory.  Object hovered motionless for about 10 to 20 seconds and then shifted to an orange color and began to move in a northerly direction, closer to us. It hovered again completely motionless and silent.  The object began to fade until it was no longer visible. Motions were smooth and consistent in their path. Weather conditions: Clear sky, no moon, warm night. Other air traffic in the area. We are both professionals in the electronics and medical fields, over the age of 50, and certain that the lights were not weather balloons, flares, or conventional aircraft because of the type of light, trajectory, lack of sound and the length of sighting.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
Single red/orange light moving east to west at the speed of a satellite lasting thirty seconds;2014-05-02 22:15:00;30 seconds;Single red/orange light moving east to west at the speed of a satellite lasting thirty seconds While listening to NUFORC report on c2c in my back yard I looked up and thought I was seeing a satellite moving from east to west.  The object was about the same size and brightness as a small star, only it was orange/red in color and was not blinking.  I first picked it up inthe area of  the star Alphekka and watch as it moved to the star Procyon.  The speed was about the same as most satellites that I observe and the intensty about equal.   I have never seen a satellite or reflection from a craft this color.   There were several aircraft below this object with normal blinking running lights to compair to, so I would have to say that it was not a regular aircraft, although I have never seen a drone at night and I don't know what type of lighting they would display, plus the speed makes me thing it was a Red satellite.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343

3 of us were looking at Venus and Jupiter in the early a.m. sky, when we noticed a large ball of light about the brightness of Venus.;2016-01-26 07:05:00;A few seconds;Three of us were looking at Venus and Jupiter in the early morning sky, when we noticed a large ball of light, about the brightness of Venus, or a little brighter, just above Jupiter.   We looked back at Venus, then look back at Jupiter and the ball of light was gone.   We stared at it for a good 3 to 4 minutes wondering if it could be another planet, and remarking that it was in the wrong place for the planet alignment.  We looked away for only a second, look back and it was gone.   It had no movement nor did it have any flashing lights to represent an airplane or anything like that.  It just looked like a very bright planet just above Jupiter in the western sky.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343

River of lights in the sky above Queen Creek;2017-12-18 20:00:00;15 minutes;river of lights in the sky above Queen Creek It looked like a a multi-lane highway of lights that seemed to hang like stars but were swooping slowly in a formation.  They moved slowly along the sky like a river of stars, but they weren't as high as stars, as I could see them from different angles as I drove away.  I stopped and took pictures.   I stopped another driver passing by they didn't notice at first with the bright street lights drowning out the sight, but once they saw it they were amazed as well and tried to get pictures too.  I've never seen anything like this.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
