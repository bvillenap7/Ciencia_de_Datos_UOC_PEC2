Bright red sphere glowing in the sky.;2009-08-08 22:30:00;20 Minutes;Bright red sphere glowing in the sky. My wife and I were walking out dogs and noticed a brightly burning redish sphere to the north at what looked to be a very high altitude. It was glowing brighter and dimming but did not have a distinct pattern to the glow. It was moving very slowly from west to east. It eventually stopped moving and remained in one spot for about 5 minutes. Then very quickly it seemed to just shrink and disapear.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343

Driving north on Elsworth and was looking up at the sky as I was right next to Williams AFB and Gateway Airport.  Object was bright blue in the eastern sky, opposite of the airfield, and looked like a shooting star until it made a 90 degree turn and picked up speed moving in another direction.  Sighting lasted a few seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.2487000000001;-111.6343
Multiple orange balls moving across the sky;2012-03-15 21:00:00;1 minute;Multiple orange balls moving across the sky While attending a family backyard evening BBQ with several adults and some younger nieces and nephews present, the oldest nephew stepped out from the house to back yard where we were gathered and stated “hey, what it that?”   When we all turned to him he was pointing towards the northwest part of the sky and what we saw was a orange glowing ball shape traveling from west to east and slightly north of our perspective.  It stayed visible for approximately 30 seconds and appeared to get smaller in size as it moved towards the east as if also moving away from us.   About five minutes later one of the adults yelled out “there are more of them”.  This time there were 3 of the same objects, at about the same distance (about the size of a ping-pong ball at arms length), traveling in single file with about 3 ping-pong ball size spaces between them.  However this time they moved more in a southern direction then made a wide turn and headed north.  Staying visible and getting ! smaller until they were out of sight. From the time we first saw this group of 3, until they were out of sight, lasted 60 seconds at most. One of the adults called the local sheriffs dept to report what we had seen, the dept took his info and noted they were receiving other calls about the same thing at that time. He also called the local TV news station to report what we had seen they also noted other calls referring to like sightings. This took place on a clear night, no clouds, no wind, no trees or houses in the view and no sounds were heard. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

They appeared to line up and then one by one began to disappear, one after the other.   Moments after the last one disappeared, we saw one less illuminated, take off North at an incredible speed.  Much faster than ANYTHING I have ever seen.  That was it, happened approximately over a 15-20 second period.  Ironically, as we drove away, there were LOTS of planes flying in many different directions no different than any other night or day.  NONE of which were near this event at the time it occured.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
