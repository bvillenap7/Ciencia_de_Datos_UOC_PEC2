Sure enough they looked like stars, all the same size moving from West to East at a rapid pace. some were in formation of a V and some were not.  They all appeared to be going in the same direction at the same rate of speed.  It was weird because we could see planes and their lights were blinking, but these stars were lit only by the glow of the moon like regular stars were, no blinking lights at all and going much faster than planes fly, it only took 30 seconds for them to fly by and disappear.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
Flashing lights that turned into a steady burning ball and then vanished.;2013-10-16 19:30:00;10 minutes;Flashing lights that turned into a steady burning ball and then vanished. Four flashing lights traveling in sequence with each other with unusual flashing.  Objects were heading south east.  Just as they were almost out of sight, the flashing lights turned into 4 steady burning objects.  Comparable to flares, but stayed in one spot and all 4 were parallel to each other.  They burned for a steady 30 seconds and then vanished.  My wife and I both saw them and have never seen anything like that before.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343

The light got very bright and then another would appear to the right of it heading South. The first light would dim out and another would appear to the right of the second. In succession one would dim and another would almost seem to leap frog about 7 times and stopped.  Then they moved instantly a little more North and started doing the leap frog again but heading West only about 5 times and then nothing.  The first set would only have 2 on at a time (just a bright dot). The second group would have 3 on. The whole event lasted less than a minute and did not happen again. I did not see any objects as the lights were very far away. When talking with my father in law he mentioned he got them on camera and I have a clip.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
Lights high in sky above my flying machine (Paramotor).;2019-01-07 17:15:00;10 minutes;Lights high in sky above my flying machine (Paramotor) I was flying my paramotor, and my iPhone was strapped to my right leg.  Sometimes I video my wing witch is another name for my parachute, to make sure all is well above me...lins aren't tangled, chute is fully deployed, etc.  I noticed a light above my wing.  Looks like it way higher than me, but it's didn't seem to move.  I went out next day to check for a star at the same time and it was not visible.  I have video of it and another person sent me a pic from their windshield from way east of my location showing the same light and 2 others adjacent to it in the sky directly near my location.  It was interesting to say the least to see just the one light, but when I received a pic from a friend driving towards me who saw that light plus two that I couldn't see, I was intrigued.  Could be weather balloons, but why 3 of them?  I was at around 1200ft in the air when I took the video looking straight up above me.  No contrails, though the jets were leaving con! trails that day..;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
