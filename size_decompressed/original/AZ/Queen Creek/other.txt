Possible sky quake in Queen Creek, AZ.;2015-04-09 20:00:00;1 second;Possible sky quake in Queen creek AZ Walking the dog with my wife in a quite neighborhood when 3 ground pounding booms came from the southwestern sky.  We stopped and looked in the area for anything that might resemble a plane or military jet.  Didn't see any, sounds kind of like the reported  sky quakes I have heard before on you tube.  My wife said she felt it in her chest and so did I.  Kind of like being at a bombing range only very rapid and close together. Boom, boom, boom.  You could feel the shock wave on your skin.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
