Semi-transparent white ball sighted in Queen Creek ,AZ;2009-01-15 14:04:00;40 seconds;Semi-transparent white ball sighted in Queen Creek ,AZ I sighted a white semi-transparent round ball coming over my house from the Northwest traveling Southeast approximately 400 feet in the air. It covered approximately 2 miles in 40 to 45 seconds , just skimming the top of the San Tan Foothills. The weather that day was 75 and Sunny no clouds at all in the sky, winds were 5 mph. There was no noise coming from the ball (object) and never changed altitude the entire time it was in sight. If I had to estimate the size of the object I would say it was as big as a king sized bed. Again ,it was translucent or semi-transparent white in color with no metallic features at all. I'm just hoping it was reported by someone else as well.;33.2487000000001;-111.6343
UFO filmed over queen creek, az.;2013-09-02 19:00:00;20 minutes;ufo filmed over queen creek az Filmed a bright blue white object in the northern sky.  Appeared to be stationary moving very little.  More of a rotation than movement.  Unlike anything I have ever seen.  Totaly unnatural in appearance.  After a few mknutes it looked to have changed color.  Yo a red orange color and move away.  Steadily and silently move away.  Then stopping and reassuming the bright blue white color again but farther out in the atmosphere though.  Looked more like a star at that point.
