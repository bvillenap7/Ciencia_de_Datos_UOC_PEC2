One seemed to be following the other. There was no sound coming from them as they approached.The light appeared to be coming from a sphere. they seemed to be flying level heading due East. I ran in to get my camcorder and as I returned they had flown directly overhead of my wife and two children. As I tried to follow them with the recorder they semed to turn slightly right and slow to a stop. I recorded a plane flying below them in the view finder for a reference. Also as they appeared to stop they seemed to fade and then grow brighter. Don't know if the lights faded because of the plane going by or not but we have a few minutes of it on video with a porch and planes as a reference.It flew directly overhead of my wife and kids.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
High altitude oval traveling from SW to the NE, stopped then ascended upward until it vanished;2003-02-09 10:45:00;10 minutes;High altitude oval traveling from SW to the NE, stopped then ascended upward until it vanished At approximately 10:45 am I was taking some photos of my Sister-in Laws house. An object caught my eye in the SW sky at a very high altitude. It was hard to make out the shape of the object however it appeared to be oval & silver/white w/ blue skies as a background. This object was traveling very slow & left no contrail. I compared this object to surrounding air traffic which all were leaving contrails at 35k feet. I watched as the object moved in a NE direction but not in a linear direction. I watched as it appeared to stop & ascend upward until it vanished out of sight. This entire event lasted about ten minutes. I don’t know of any aircraft that moves like this. I was able to capture some photos & upon zooming in on them w/ my computer, it certainly was not an airplane. My guess is that this object was at a very high altitude because even using 9x zoom, it was hard to make the shape out. One thing I did notice on the zoomed photos was defined shading on the bottom of the object. I work in the aerospace industry & I’ve seen many unexplained objects in the sky, mainly the reddish orange orbs typically seen in Gilbert, AZ.

Gold shining spherical light on an unusual course;2005-08-30 20:36:00;05 minutes;Gold shining spherical light on an unusual course Gold/yellowish sphere moved slowly(speed similar to plane ready to land) on straight course from S.W. to N.E. Black,clear,moonless,cloudless sky.About the size of Venus,but not as bright.Saw same object 2 nights earlier but traveling N.W. to S.E.I became curious as it did not act nor appear as aircraft or satellites.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
A strange bright sphere was moving in all directions but in short bursts, a beam of light came out of the object and it dissapeared.;2012-01-16 00:00:00;around 4 hours;A strange bright sphere was moving in all directions but in short bursts, a beam of light came out of the object and it dissapeared. I saw a bright ball in the north east night sky.  It moved back and forth and up and down in quick short bursts. then what looked to be a beam of light comeing from the strange object, every thing wierd stopped happening to it and it started heading up and east.  after a few hours of watching it vannished. this was no airplane or heli.  if you guys recognize this type back if you can, and tell me what is going on. thank you for your time.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Red orb seen over the east valley (Phoenix);2012-09-07 21:30:00;2 minutes;Red orb seen over the east valley (Phoenix) Just let to dog out and was looking east.  I saw what I thought was an incoming airplane (they approach from the east headed west to Phoenix).  I then realized that this red light did not have any anti-collison flashers, wing tip lights, or landing lights. The object was slowly moving toward my location, then turned and headed northeast.  It disappeared behing my neighbors house. I repositioned myself but the object was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Formation of lights.;2016-05-22 23:05:00;5 minutes;Formation of lights. We witnessed lights, in formation, very close together moving from west to east.  They were very high in the sky.  As they moved to the east they either moved they disappeared from our sight.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Bright white light changing to pulsing colors and then red moving at high speeds, eventually splitting into two objects.;2020-04-13 19:10:00;10 minutes;Bright white light changing to pulsing colors and then red moving at high speeds, eventually splitting into two objects. A bright white light flying from east to west as the sun set around 7 pm.  I thought initially it was a meteor due to the speed and the fact it was higher than the clouds.  Traveled from above me to about 1/3 to the western horizon when it just faded out.  I was disappointed that the meteor just fizzled out when all of a sudden, the object reappeared at a standstill and very bright with multiple colors flashing from it.  It hovered for a few mins at the same high altitude then changed to a very bright red.  Soon after it darted in an S-shaped fashion to the south and perhaps to a lower altitude, still very bright red when it stopped again.  At this point, it split into 2 individual craft, both red in color.  One flew east and lower, the other moved what seemed to be straight down where I lost sight of it behind a tree.  Within in a few moments, the one light I could still see started to display multiple colors as it hovered, and then disappeared.  At this point, I no longer saw either craft.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
