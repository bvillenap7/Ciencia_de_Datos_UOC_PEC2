1995 Phoenix SE Valley shooting star turns 90° and crosses sky in couple of seconds.;1995-04-15 22:00:00;1 minute;1995 Phoenix SE Valley shooting star turns 90° and crosses sky in couple of seconds. I stepped out onto my patio around 10 pm because I'd heard there was to be a bit of a meteor shower and I wondered if I could see any of it from my somewhat rural location.  The sky was full of stars but I wasn't seeing much in the way of shooting stars, so after a few minutes I was ready to give up and go inside. That's when I noticed a star moving very fast from east to west across the sky. By my estimation it could have crossed the entire sky in 5 or 10 seconds. At first I thought maybe it was a satellite.  I've never seen one before but it just popped into my head that must be what this is, and I remember feeling a bit proud of myself for figuring it out.  At least that seemed like a pretty good guess until it got about 75% across the sky moving due west when it suddenly turned north and just took off so fast it was across the sky in a couple of seconds and gone. I don't know much about space but I don't think satellites can turn or move like that, so for me - this was a UFO.  It was flying and I couldn't identify it, put it that way.  Like probably millions of people, I never told anyone about it.  It's not dramatic or exciting but sometimes I wonder how different the world view would be if everyone who's seen a UFO would submit a report and I couldn't keep refusing to report my sighting with that thought in my mind.  Date and time are approximate, sorry but it was over 10 years ago now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

We saw 2 bright red lights, one blinked on and off and dropped very rapidly after ~8 minutes, the other blinked out ` 2 min later.;2000-07-25 20:50:00;15-20 min;We saw 2 bright red lights, one blinked on and off and dropped very rapidly after ~8 minutes, the other blinked out ` 2 min later. We observed 2 bright red glowing lights the were over Gilbert, AZ and slightly north of Downtown Gilbert.  They were slow moving.  One light would go in and out and after about 8 minutes the one that was fading in and out dropped very rapidly while blinking on and off and disappeared below the treeline.  The other light stayed in the same area for several more minutes then blinked out.  Approximately 10 minutes later, there appeared to be what we thought were military palnes--4 in a row moving east to west in the area that the lights were.  It also appeared the the air traffic was re-routed as where the lights were observed is in the same area that the airplanes are routed to land at Sky Harbor Airport.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

The dimmer one disappeared at 20:14 pm and the other blinked out at 20:17pm.  The airplanes appeared to be coming in much lower than normal and slightly re-routing.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Two bright red lights in the sky rising higher and higher until they were over our heads.;2000-08-15 20:00:00;20 minutes;Two bright red lights in the sky rising higher and higher until they were over our heads. Around 8pm my son and I spotted two bright red lights in the sky to the northwest of our house low on the horizon--just above the roof line of the houses in our neighborhood.  We alerted all the neighbors who joined us in watching these two light rise up over our houses.  Over approximately 20 minutes--they came almost directly overhead.  One started pulsing and dropped low in the sky and disappeared.  The other one kept moving overhead and then just disappeared.  It appeared that the air traffic was coming very close to these objects and that the objects were in the flight path. ((NUFORC Note:  Many other reports of this phenomenon during the months of July and August, three of them from the same witness who reported this sighting.  All of her reports are in full agreement with what was reported by multiple other witnesses to the same events.  PD));33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

Strange objects traveling through sky;2007-01-29 15:00:00;7 min;Strange objects traveling through sky I was driving to work on a sunny clear skied day when I noticed 2 objects in the SE sky at a very high altitude and seemed to be very far away compared to the commercial aircraft I could also see flying quite high in the same general vicinity but much closer. The objects were paralell to one another but yet one seemed to be traveling in a downward path and the other one up. Both had a wide short tail following them. I say wide in comparison to the comercial aircraft that were also flying the skies that day, it made them look very small. After about 5 minutes or so the obect on the left made a fast hook-like motion leaving a trail and they both disappeared.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

Gliding silent set of lights over Gilbert, AZ.;2010-02-08 20:22:00;1 minute;Gliding silent set of lights over Gilbert, AZ. 2/08/10 I took a break from work and walked outside the building at approx 8:22pm.  Building is located at 459 n Gilbert Rd in Gilbert, Az.  I saw in the north area of the sky, over the apartment building across the street a set of lights. There were two steady white lights with blinking red light equidistance in between them.  The red light was smaller than the two white lights and appeared to flash off something metallic or silvery in color when it was blinking.  The object was about the size of my thumb to the second joint held horizontally at arm’s length, that was the width of the object.  There was absolutely no sound.  The object moved in a slow and gliding motion towards the west and slightly northwest.  At first I thought it might be a plane, but it had no flashing red and green wingtip lights and no sound.  Also the lights didn’t look like a helicopter and again there was no sound and it had that gliding motion.  I lost it behind the trees, it was that low and then caught a glimpse of it again further away and more to the west and slightly northwest but then lost it again behind the buildings. I did not see it emerge from behind the buildings so it may have turned more northerly or it may have descended even further.  I went back into my workplace.  The entire sighting took no more than 2 minutes I would guess…maybe 3 tops.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

Tiny cluster of white orbs one by one quickly appearing a disappearing. So close together it may have looked like one object.;2013-09-05 18:00:00;5 seconds;Tiny cluster of white orbs one by one quickly appearing a disappearing. So close together it may have looked like one object at a glanc I was looking out my office window towards four peaks as something caught my eye, I thought it was a firework at first but upon a closer look it was not.  A small cluster of white orbs appearred rapidly one by one.  There was probably about 10-15 of them but they were so close together it may have looked like one object at a glace.  They stayed lit for about 4 seconds and just as quick as they appeared, one by one they disappeared.  The whole thing lasted probably 7-8 seconds. I quickly told my collegues (who thought I was crazy)  We watched the same area and about 2 minutes later the same thing appeared in the sky about 20-30 miles North of four peaks this time and much higher.  They were just as baffled as me. None of us had ever seen anything like that in the sky before;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Military jet accelerates toward an object above Gilbert, AZ.;2015-12-11 07:30:00;8 seconds;Military jet accelerates toward an object above Gilbert, AZ. Looked up due to the distinct sound of a military aircraft accelerating.  Saw a fighter jet quickly closing on an object with three lights (no blinking lights)  The military jet throttled down as it approached the object and closely shadowed it.   The object size was about the same size as the military jet and appeared to be either circular or triangular...can't say for sure, it was dark.  Two red lights in the back and one light green or orange light going forward.   I was surprised at how closely the military jet shadowed the object.  I'm estimating the elevation of the two aircraft at +- 1000 to 1500 ft. above surface level. ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain as to whether this is a servious report.
