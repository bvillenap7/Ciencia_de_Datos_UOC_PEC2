I actually watched it with Binoculars for about 3 minutes.;2000-06-02 19:50:00;4 minutes;I actually watched it with Binoculars for about 3 minutes. I was standing on my apt balcony, smoking a cigarette, when I looked eastward and noticed a pinkish red light that  looked very simular to an oncoming airplane headlight but the color was very different. Usually the plane light would be whiteish in color. That's why it caught my eye. I kept looking at it for about a minute and a half with the naked eye and when I  had come to the conclusion that it was not moving I ran and got my Binoculars out. I focusedd in on it and saw that the light I had seen was actually 4 lights positioned in a 12 oclock, 3 oclock, 6 oclock, 9 oclock pattern and they had looked like one light to the naked eye.  I kept watching it even as 2 Jet liners flew between me and the object. I also saw a helicopter flying towards me and assume that they must have had to see it also. I tried to find anyone in veiw of me to confirm what I was seeing but nobody was around. I even tried to see if my neighbor was home but he wasn't. I continued to watch the object hover and then all of sudden it took off so fast that it seemed to disapear. All I saw the very first part of the take off andd there was nothing left to follow. I have not told anyone else of this other than my exwife who is now convinced that I am nuts.   I sure hope that other people report this or I  might start doughting even my own sanity!;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

Round illuminated object in sky over Gilbert, Queen Creek area this afternoon.;2013-08-31 14:00:00;15 minutes;Round illuminated object in sky over Gilbert, Queen Creek area this afternoon. Wife and I were out back in our pool.  A round object that was stationary in the sky was just sitting in mid air.  I went and got our binoculars.  When I returned (less than a minute) my wife was still watching it.  Suddenly it vanished but then it quickly appeared overhead. I looked at it with the biniculars and saw a round object that was strongly illuminated with something spining underneath.  It again suddenly disappeared.  The altitude appeared higher than the local air traffic flight path. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
