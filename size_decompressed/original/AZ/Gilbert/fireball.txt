Three orange fireball like objects over Gilbert, AZ.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by aerospace engineer.  PD));2013-07-06 23:30:00;20 seconds;Three orange fireball like objects over Gilbert AZ One orange what appeared to be a fireball moving East to West quickly but under cloud level.  Object was large as compared to Jet on final approach to Sky Harbor.   !0 min later two more appeared in a staggered formation.   The first went sharply from East west direction to SW while the second continued West.   Orange light dimmed then brightened then faded out. I could barely make out a shape but would say triangular and totally silent.   I have never witnessed anything like this before so it was the weirdest thing to see.   I didn't have time to video it unfortunately.   I am an aeronautical engineer and was out locking my truck at the time.   I thought it could be an F-35 but no exhaust plume seen or sound heard.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Flaming UFO.;2014-06-01 20:45:00;1 minute;Flaming UFO On June 1, 2014, I was leaving my job near the southwest side of Gilbert, Arizona, heading toward the southeast side.  I was on the telephone and was looking for traffic behind me in the side mirror of my vehicle and noticed a red light that looked as if it could have been from a hot air balloon (which are popular around these parts) to the north.   After staring for some time I realized there wasn't a hot air balloon.  The craft appeared like a triangle with a round top and looked to have flames coming off it.  But, after watching a few moments, the craft looked to be moving upward and so were the flames.   I told the person on the phone what I was seeing in detail as I continued to look back and forth at the object as I proceeded to drive eastward down the road.   As I continued on looking back and forth at the object (unable to stop due to traffic around me), it continued upward until it looked like a small dot next to the moon.   I did not see it go through the atmosphere.  It moved at a slower pace until it got further upward.   I believe this to be a UFO because this is not my first visual encounter.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
