Bright red lights dropping smaller lights;2000-03-30 18:52:00;10 minutes;Bright red lights dropping smaller lights Unfortunatly I don't remember the exact date, however I know it happened right after I had moved in to my apartment late March/early April 2000.  My younger brother was standing on the balcony of our apartment located on Country Club just south of Baseline Rd in Gilbert, AZ and he yelled to us that there was something going on in the sky to the southeast.  Upon going outside, there appeared to be 3-4 red lights in the sky, and it looked like they were dropping other smaller lights. We only witnessed this going on for approx 10 minutes before the lights disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

AT 20:10 07/12/2000 I SPOTTED A BRIGHT RED ROUND CRAFT FLYING SLOWLY OUT OF THE WEST AT ABOUT 15000 FT. I ESTIMATED THE HIEGHT BY THE INCOMING PLANES IN THE AREA. IT STOPPED AND CHANGED FROM BRIGHT RED TO A LESS BRIGHT RED ALTERNATING BACK AND FORTH. THE OBJECT THEN MOVED UP TO ABOUT 30,000FT. AND STOPPED FOR ABOUT 5 MIN. IT THEN ROSE TO A HIEGHT EQUAL TO A BRIGHT STAR, AND SEEMED TO TURN THE SAME COLOR AS THE STARS. MY FAMILY VIEWED THIS FROM THE FIRST PART.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
A red brilliant light hovered above my community for approximately 25 minutes, quickly disappearing into the sky.;2000-07-13 19:25:00;25 minutes;A red brilliant light hovered above my community for approximately 25 minutes, quickly disappearing into the sky. At approximately 7:15p.m. on July 13,2000 I was sitting on my back patio watching my 3 children play on their swingset when I observed one red moving light in the sky. Being in the flight pattern for Phoenix Sky Harbor, I lke to point out the low flying (descending) aircraft to my son. When this particular light did not have the usual accompanying white and blue lights like the other aircrafts, I kept watching it intently. I also thought it was strange and unusual because it was moving from NW and heading towards my home which is SE. The airport would have been to the object's West position. It appeared to be hovering as it moved, without any up or down movement. It stopped just above my home and shined like a brilliant red star. It didn't appear to have any body, however, the object was too bright to see a dark shaped fuselage of any type. I had my daughter get my camera and I took several (4) snapshots of the object with other commercial aircraft in the frame. After observing it for approximately 20-25 minutes, it disappeared.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

A bright red object, pulsing high in the sky, hovered for approximately 11:00.   It made no sound nor had a jet trail.;2000-07-13 20:10:00;11:00;A bright red object, pulsing high in the sky, hovered for approximately 11:00.   It made no sound nor had a jet trail. At the above date and time, a red circular (ball shaped) craft hovered in the sky, occasionally drifting south.  Sky Harbor International Airport is approximately 17 miles away, so commercial airlines were observed flying below the craft.  A 737 airline, flying approximately 10,000 feet,  was considerably below the craft craft, which appeared to remain still.  In relation to the 737, the craft was approximately  1/20th the size of the 737.  The craft was glowing red and displayed a blinking less red light on top.  Occasionally, the craft would move, but prior to its movement, there appeared to be white sparkles that surrounded the bottom of the craft.   There did not appear any jet trail nor sound.  The craft would occasionally glow a bright red then dim itself.  This went on for several minutes.  The sky was partly cloudy and it was almost dark.  No other lights of similar nature were near.  As the craft drifted south, it would seem to correct itself and return to its original position. After approximately 11:00, the craft moved southward at approximately twice the speed of an airliner, disappearing into the night sky.  Just prior to the craft's departure, white sparkles seemed to eminate around the bottom of the craft, and the craft itself turned bright red, pulsing red and less red in .25 second intervals.  The night before, a craft which appeared identical to this one appeared in relatively the same area at the same time.  The craft was filmed  and  was aired on the 6:00 news in Phoenix on 7/13/2000.  The family that saw the UFO were interviewed and the video was scrutinezed by the local MUFON representatives.  The newscast was the Channel 3 news.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Two bright red-orange objects over Gilbert for 5-7 minutes with no sounds;2000-07-25 20:15:00;5-7 minutes;Two bright red-orange objects over Gilbert for 5-7 minutes with no sounds Two very bright red-orange objects approached our home from the NW, crossed over us and changed directions heading E/NE. One object was slightly below cloud level and one, which appeared smaller, looked to be above the thin clouds. Both objects seemed to grow brighter from time to time and stay in formation as they moved across the sky. The sighting lasted 5-7 minutes with both objects keeping the same speed and distance as if flying in formation. The objects seemed to be going in a straight line until they were almost directly above us when the brighter of the two headed E/NE and increased its speed while the other continued directly east and began to fade. Noticed 5 possible military aircraft in formation at high altitude approx 20 min after the objects dissapeared.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

After about 2 minutes, the object was due North of me,slightly higher on the horizon, and seemed to slow a little as it now headed due East. As the object past me and after about 4 minutes from the time I first saw it, an aircraft ( probably commercial ) came relatively close to the object. Soon after ( 15 or 20 seconds), the object seemed to dim, then brighten, speed up and quickly dissappear on the horizon E-NE of me. The characteristics of the object seemed almost identical to the brighter of the two objects observed and reported almost exactly 48 hours earlier.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

i have seen these red lights over az that have random blinks and suddenly dissapear. no actual craft shape, just lights.;2002-08-25 20:00:00;30-45 min.;i have seen these red lights over az that have random blinks and suddenly dissapear. no actual craft shape, just lights. on this night i was in my barn feeding my horses when i looked in the sky for no aparent reason. suddenly i saw a red light. I emediatly knew what it was since i have seen these lights before. its a light that many people are studying. infact i personly have helped investigate these lights before. they usualy apear in 1 or 2 lights. they hover and move very slowly and when they move fast they blink randomly and either speed off out of sight or simply stop blinking. on this night the light did exactly that. it moved from a south western position to a south eastern position where it disapeared. i called fox 10, a news channel in az, and asked if they knew what this was and they ended up doing a report on this particular light. they talked with officials from williams air force base who said  the light was just a beacon on a cesna airplane. personly i do not believe this explanation becasues cesna planes cannot fly so high as to look as though they are moving so slow and the cannat fly at their normal altitudes at such a slow speed. also, cesna plaines have other blinking lights on them not just one that suddenly stops blinking. i have seen these lights more then 10 times and i would love to here and see proof of what thy really are. oh well maybe some day.

Observed nine circles, NW of Queen Creek, over Chandler. They went from a box formation to triangle formation.;2009-05-28 07:10:00;20 min;Observed nine circles, NW of Queen Creek, over Chandler. They went from a box formation to triangle formation. This is for cross reference purposes to note more than one witness to this visual:  Description: My daughter called me stating that the local radio, 97.8 FM (website has audio recording of it) is talking about 11 to 16 disks in the sky above Chandler (she was driving to work and couldn't see). I went out my front door talking to her and initially looked in the direction of Chandler, NW, to try and see what she was talking about. Didn't see anything and joked with her about needing to drive into Chandler to try and observe what the radio was talking about. Said good byes. I then went back out and leaned on my Honda roof and slowly started to scan the sky in the direction of Chandler. I then came across 2 white/shiny disks/orbs at about a 35degree angle. They were side by side with about a pinky width between them. I then continued scanning the skyline, due to the reported 11 to 16, and ended up observing 7 more white/shiny orbs/disks at about a 45 degree angle that stuck out against the clear blue sky. This second set of obrs/disks were in 2 groups. One group of three were in a triangle pattern while the other was in a box formation (one orb/disk in each corner of a box and a triangle formation. Ran in and told my wife (which she just laid there) and then grabbed the camera and proceeded to take 40 pictures with my Vivitar, vivicam 5386, 3x zoom f=5.4-16.2mm. By this time my wife walked out to see what I was talking about (her eyes were still adjusting to waking up, and didn't see anything). She advised I should wake up my 8yr old to have her come look. During the whole time of observing, I was quit elated that I FINALLY got to see things in the sky. My eyes kept feeling wierd, trying to adjust on such small objects.

We saw a red object in the sky, that started as a smooth arc to the east.  Then the object began to bobble, shifting positions quickly and erratically, left to right, up and down.  At one point the light turned to blue and then changed back to red.   Colors changed intermittently from red to blue several times.  Then it displayed both red and blue and slowly and controllably descended out of the field of view in a straight line.  The lighted object was much larger than traditional airplane lights, approximately 1/8th the size of the moon last night.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

Me and my kids were driving and four round bright orange/red lights swiftly moving across the sky caught my eye.  I was amazed and my kids looked up to see what I was looking at and they were also amazed.  There were four bright lights, which seemed to be round.  They traveled across they sky in a group and then they came to a stop.  They stayed in the sky for about a minute or less then gradually, one by one, they started to dim until each one disappeared.   I have a picture but it was much clearer in person.  When I zoom in on the picture, they look like orange upside down question marks without the dot.  One of them looks white because it is disappearing but it is the same shape as the other three.  It was night time and they seemed to be as high up in the sky as stars but they were bigger than stars.

Walking dogs in Gilbert, AZ, neighborhood a little south of Ray Rd, east of Higley Rd.   Was walking East and looked up to sky and saw what looked like a satellite way up high going south.  I even mentioned it to my husband.   Then as we walked further south, turning the corner going East, I kept looking for the satellite, all the sudden, halfway lower to the distance of the satellite, we both saw a light the shape of a circle that looked like a bright star, but it was moving fast and was now going Southeast.  We both were watching it talking about it because it had no lights, just a circle of light moving across the sky.  Then all the sudden, as we were watching it, the light just disappeared right before our eyes.  There were no clouds in the sky.  We both said that no way it was any type of airplane. It was very weird and strange.  I would have never thought I would ever see anything like this.   Last night I was even going to call the 911 or airport, but I decided to! wait for today to check in the Internet to see if it was mentioned by anybody else.  While I was searching, I found this website so I can report it.  Thank you.
