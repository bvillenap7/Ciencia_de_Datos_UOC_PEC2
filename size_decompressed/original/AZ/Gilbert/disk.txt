On Saturday October 9, 2010 in Gilbert AZ I was outside playing with my five year old nephew when I looked up in the sky to see what appeared to be a star in the sky. It was around 5:38 PM and I thought that this was odd because the sun wasn’t to set till about another 20 minutes at 6:01 and the sky was clear blue with plenty of sunlight.  I thought it might be a planet so I ran inside to get the binoculars. I came back and located it again as it was the only odd light in the sky. When looking through the scope it appeared to be a circular disc-like object that had a weird reddish light mixed with white light around it that appeared to be changing color. It was stationary and did not have the blinking lights of a plane. I then ran inside to get my father and we got another set of binoculars. I couldn’t find the first object that I saw as it had moved. We then saw four distinct lights in the south southeast sky that had the same appearance as the first.  All four of them were stationary without blinking lights of a plane or movement of a satellite. With the naked eye they looked like faint stars in the sky but once again this was very odd as it was blue sky and before the sunset.  When they were magnified with the binoculars we both were able to see circular disc-like objects. I saw the same red and white lights that were around the first one almost like an orb or aura and appeared to change colors. My father only saw white lights when he looked but clearly saw the circular disc shape of the objects as I did. Three of the objects were in a line and the fourth was up and to the right of the other three. The objects stayed in the sky for around five to six minutes and then they were just gone! . I checked my cell and it was 5:45 PM still 16 minutes before sunset. If they were stars or planets they would have gotten brighter as the sunset occurred but this was not the case as they vanished after observing them for six minutes. They were not a plane or satellite because they did not move or have the blinking lights.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
2/3/2011 Gilbert AZ  shaped disc with glowing dim redish light  few seconds;2011-02-03 20:40:00;second;2/3/2011 Gilbert AZ  shaped disc with glowing dim redish light  few seconds I was driving in my car and I noticed a hazy redish light glowing but dim that is what caught my eye. (Not like a helicopter red light)  The shape reminded me of a womens large rimmed hat the craft must have been tipped because I saw the top that is where the light came from.  I did a u-turn I wanted to get a better look or follow it.  It was gone?    Then when I got on the 205 freeway I noticed large glowing orbs of light that dissapeared.  I thought maybe its foggy out?   But its it a clear night and this is Arizona we are not known for fog.   This totally looked like what I'v seen in drawings.   I don't know if anyone else saw this but its not the phoenix light thing at all. This was a ufo and it was fast it vanished!
