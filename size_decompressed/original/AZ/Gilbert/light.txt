Large red light seen over the Phoenix area in the north sky;2000-06-09 20:15:00;15 minutes;Large red light seen over the Phoenix area in the north sky Approximately 8:15pm, my neighbors and I saw a bright red light in the sky.  The light was the color of a car tailight, larger than any planet, star, or airplane light, and was approximately 30 degrees above the horizon in the north sky.  The light drifted slowly upward for a couple minutes.  The light then began to dim and brighten slowly, eventually flickered and disappeared.  After, in the northwest sky (near Sky Harbor airport) just above the houses, we saw another light of the same description.  Over the course of approximately 15 minutes the light drifted slowly eastward and upward to a similar position as the first light.  The light then dimmed, brightened, flickered and disappeared just like the first one.  During this time the air traffic in the area was greatly decreased.  A couple weeks before, one of the six witnesses stated he saw a similar light (unknown time).  On Saturday 6/10/00, I was outside about 8:15pm when I witnessed the same light in the north sky, this time approximately 45 degrees   above the horizon.  My wife was able to film the light for a couple minutes until it dimmed, brightened, flickered, then disappeared as the others had done.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

By the way, I enjoy your segments with Art Bell. Anyway, I saw the report on the red lights over Gilbert over the past year and would like to add some objective observations. I fist saw these lights about 1 1/2 years ago. They were no more than 500 feet above my house. I immediately got out the binoculars and the 'lights' proved to be nothing more that road flares suspended under baloons. The flare was too bright to be seen itself but it clearly showed the five or six baloons above it. Both my kids and the wife were able to see the object for what it was. Due to the height of these objects I would guess that they are being launched within 1/4 mile of the house. They generally drift eastward, but I have seen one headed west. We look forward to these launches because for the 20 minutes or so that the flares burn they will travel two to three miles away and up to a height of over 2000 feet. The only issue I have with these pranks is that the winds usually take these object into the northbound landing flight zones of the Phoenix airport. Dull as it sounds, that's all there is. Only wish I had seen the Phoenix lights a few years ago. Thx for you time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approxiamte.  PD));33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Red lights hovering toward the east of Gilbert AZ.;2000-07-25 20:15:00;15 mins;Red lights hovering toward the east of Gilbert AZ. It was about 8:15 Pm and as usually i was chasing my 21 month old daughter around after I had just ate dinner.  We ended outside with my father in law and my wife.  Hey was watering his lawn and she was out there smoking a Cig.  I walked out and looked up in the sky and off to the horizon I would say North East from the house's driveway there were to Red Laser looking light just hovering pulsing in the sky.  This was definately not a plane since it didn't have the tradional 3 light and no blinking.  It was way higher than the aircrafts since they were still passing trying to make there pass back to the airport to land.  It seemed the planes were not flying out as far as usually since the Red Dot  were out to the east and they were flying way lower than usually.  As we watched the Red DOTs they started to move from were they were stationed for about 5 minutes.  Moving slow in a south direction they seemed to keep the same distance and same speed really slow as they went a little further I would say almost directly East from where I was standing they then stopped and sat there and kept the same exact distance and the one on the right side started blinking in and out and a different rate of speed slowly and then fast and then it would be steady, it started again but there was no pattern to the lights and only the red laser color which they had been the entire time.  As we watched the one on the left hand side which had been a steady light the entire time start to move south then droped below  the other all of a sudden the left Red light started moving very fast as if directly below the other light.  All of a sudden as it kept moving south it shoot out to the right side and was gone I would say with in 3 seconds i was like Dam that was fast. All of a sudden the last light which was alway on the left had side started to fade out and up as if moving out toward space with in seconds they wer both gone.  As we looked around we oticed no Planes in the vecinity all of a sudden you see a fast jet going thru the sky as if from williams air force base.  at the rate it was going it wouldn't have a chance at catching the red light.  Then as if the coast was all clear or trying to cover something up air planes we flown in almost by the dozens.  This was an exciting but scary moment;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

The two red lights were in the western sky and far apart from eachother but they were moving in the same direction which was towardds the South east.  We continued to watch them, we even tried to view them through a telescope but we couldn't fallow them.

One stayed in pretty much the same position while the other moved down and then slowely circled under the first. A couple of planes came towards them, then they seemed to close the distance between them. The higher one then seemed to shoot something out of the top of it, then flashed as it dropped rapidly and blinked out. The remaining one then dimmed for a couple of seconds, then from our view, a plane seemed to come close and changed direction to avoid it. It then blinked out. I recorded almost 10 min. of these lights. This is the second time I have recorded these lights around the same time. No moon out at the time ( or it was behind clouds ). One also seemed to have another light (small white) above and to the left of the higher red light. There was no sound associated with these lights.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
A radiating sextant  in red.;2000-08-15 20:10:00;2015;A radiating sextant  in red. At approximately 2010 my wife and I were getting out of our pool, we noticed two red objects located South of our location, Object A was about 25 degrees above the horizon.  Object B was about 30 degrees above the horizon and 1 degree or so to the west.  My wife went into the house.  Their lights seemed to radiant in the cardinal directions of N, NE, SE, S, SW, W, SW.   They appeared stationary. Civilian aircraft passed beneath them and one aircraft passed at a high altitude.  Upon the passing of the higher altitude aircraft object A's lights pulsed and it seemed to go upward.  My wife came back outside and we observed object A moving to the south at an extremely high rate of speed.  Object B remained in position for about 3 to 4 minutes more.  Then another two aircraft passed underneath object B. Object B pulsed similar to object A and went straight up and disappeared.  I took a couple of photographs of both objects. My background is military, combat veteran. I have observed helicopter, ground attack aircraft, fighters, and high altitude bombers as well as transport aircraft of all types  I have never witnessed anything like this. I don't have images yet.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

A couple of airliners on final approach to the local airport were also in the area below the objects. There was no sound associated with them. As they moved due south, the second object released a smaller flickering red light that appeared to fall to the ground, and disappeared.  The first object continued west for about another minute, also released a a smaller flicjering red light, and then disappeared.  This was seen from a normal housing area, temp approx. 95-100 degrees, with light cloud formations.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

I watched it for 40 minutes, with my Binoculars and someone on the phone, letting me know I was not the only one!  This make twice now!;2000-10-12 18:45:00;35 minutes;I watched it for 40 minutes, with my Binoculars and someone on the phone, letting me know I was not the only one!  This make twice now! At exactly 6:45 pm I went out on my balcony to smoke a cigarette. I looked south in the sky and saw a very simular colored light, to one I have previously reported to this site. It was a reddish/pink colored light, that seemed to fade and brighten. Not Blink! at first the light stayed stationary at about 11 o'clock high. I then went and retrieved my Binoculars to get a clearer look at the object. Sure enough, it was the exact same light that I had seen before. It had 4 seperate bright points. Such as 4 engines would look, positioned at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock.  The object then began to move eastward, VERY SLOWLY and it was at this time that I called 911 to see if anyone else had reported it. They informed me that I was not the only one to see it. They had a number of calls about it, and suggested that I call Gateway International Airport. I explained to the operator that if I were to go get my phone book, look up the number to the airport, and call them. The object would surely be gone.  This is what happened to me previously. So, instead, I just kept watching it. I then got a phone call from a friend out in east mesa, she wanted to know if I was also aware of the light in the sky. I said yes. We then kept in contact via the phone all the way through the total sighting. It finally disappeared at about 7:20pm after moving as far east as i60 and Gilbert road. It got real bright, real dim, real bright, etc., etc. Then all of a sudden, It was gone. I truly hope that someone will find out what it is that I have had the luck to view 2 times now.  I did call gateway, and they said they too were looking at it, but had no information pertaining to it's origin.  THIS WAS SO COOL!   I hope it get's the attention it surely deserves.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

I arrived home and stepped out of my car and instantly noticed a bright light off in the far East.  It was moving from right to left in downward slant and disappeared out of view behind a neighbor’s house.  I initially thought it to be a falling/shooting star, but then it rose again above the house.  The light was far brighter than the planet/star that was also present in my view.  The light almost had a blue/white hue to it.  The light then continued to drop and rise in an extremely fast motion, followed by left to right motion, loopy motion, and more up and down motions, constantly appearing and disappearing out of my view because of the house. I ran in to get a camera unable to find one, ran back out to find it still making the motions in the sky.  After calling a family member to find the camera I ran back in to get the camera, came back out and it was out of sight.  I stayed waiting outside when it appeared again, but staying still.  The light then grew in brightness/intensity.  While trying to find it in my camera screen, it disappeared.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

My wife ((name deleted)), my son ((name deleted)), and I saw a mysterious phenomenon last night at approximately 8:30 pm. The attached pics and vids are taken from our front yard looking directly south. The property is located just northeast of Elliot and Val Vista Roads in Gilbert.  Initially, we saw an object streaking in the southeast sky heading west and descending in a diagonal trajectory.  It had a bright white light with a trailing tail and looked like a falling star, which is what I at first thought it was. It also appeared to be emitting sparks.  The object came to a stop at a position due south of our property and 45 degrees above the horizon.  The object held its position while emitting a significantly dimmer light. I originally thought that it was the spot where the falling star (meteor) had burnt out, but the light remained in the sky at the stopped position.  We continued to watch for several seconds, after which an object began to fall to the ground (perpendicular to the earth) . It seemed to emit a dim spot of light.  It traveled approximately 1/3 the distance to the ground and stopped. It then began heading east (horizontal to the earth).  At that point, the object was intensely bright and appeared to be emitting sparks very much like a fireworks display rocket.  Three additional objects did the same thing, creating a formation about 30 degrees above the horizon at a significant distance below and east of the original object.  They remained visible for several minutes, descending along looping trajectories until they disappeared below the horizon.  The attached pics and vids are of the descending formation only.  We did not have the camera working in time to capture the activity that had happened before.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

They were multi colored, blinking on and off, thousands of them.  There were three of us in my backyard, and 7 neighbors reported the phenomena on our neighborhood Facebook page.  I was able to get some grainy video on my smartphone.  It was an incredible site, I thought I must be dreaming, so I slapped my own face, but it was real.  They looked to be about 25,000 feet up, as that was the lowest cloud cover at the time, and they were above that.  Please tell me where to submit video.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness followed up to state that the objects were helium-filled balloons with flashing LED lights, which had been released at a church celebration.

I was facing west at a traffic light, waiting to turn south, or left, when a light caught the corner of my eye.  We have lots of air traffic so I thought at first it was just another plane.  It looked like a star or planet like Venus, but very low...just above treeline.  There was no sound.  It moved across the entire sky at a very high speed...the fastest thing I've ever seen go across the sky.  I'm an amateur astronomer and have seen satellites and meteors.  There was no tail or glow or sonic boom or explosion.  My first thought was it was a missile but again no tail.  Then I thought maybe it was a fireball but no tail and no reports anywhere.  I really can't say what it was that I saw but I've never seen anything like that in my life.  It was very very fast.   I teach alternative education high school science, and I don't believe in aliens or UFOs...I'm a total sk!eptic.  But I can't explain what I saw.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Three Red Glowing Lights Seen Over Gilbert, AZ - Moving and flashing making a triangular formation before vanishing.;2018-11-22 20:40:00;2 minutes;Three Red Glowing Lights Seen Over Gilbert, AZ - Moving and flashing making a triangular formation before vanishing. 3 of my teenage children and myself were getting into the car to go to the store when we witnessed 2 red lights that seemed to be intermittently twinkling.  We continued to watch the red lights and a third smaller one appeared, at which point all three lights became steadily lit and stopped twinkling.  They were in a half circle formation initially, but as the began to glow steady, they moved into a triangular formation.  Then one of the lights that was the smallest, located at the bottom left corner of the formation began to dim, and continued to dim until it completely vanished.  The red light on the bottom right of the formation became brighter, then moved more to the right and began to flash and grow dim as well, until it too, vanished completely.  The red light at the top of the triangular formation- the only light left, became brighter and continued to glow red and steady as it moved higher and higher into the sky until it was gone, just like the other two red lights.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

The white orb, however, did not have any blinking lights as do most commercial aircraft.  The flight of the orb white light was South-East and after observing it fly across the sky for a few minutes the light faded and didn't come back on.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Four orange-yellow pulsating lights in nightime sky.  ((Spacelink satellites??);2020-01-01 19:20:00;6 minutes;Four orange-yellow pulsating lights in nightime sky I reside in Gilbert, AZ. I have been a local metro police officer for 20 years in the valley. Prior to working in law enforcement, I served four years in US Naval Special Warfare. On 01/01/2020, at approximately 19:20 hours, I walked outside into the backyard with my puppy.  The night sky was partly cloudy, but I could make out some constellations and other random stars to the south.  I could also observe a few visible aircraft heading in different directions as evident by their distinct red, green, and white navigation lights.  Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport is approximately 3 miles southeast of my residence. However, I was looking directly south in the sky when I observed two circular lights appear just above the horizon.  It was as if the lights appeared out of nowhere.  The lights were of an orange-yellow glow that pulsed very slowly, but in unison.  They did not resemble any known aircraft to my knowledge.  The waxing crescent moon was visible in the partly clouded sky directly west.  With the intensity of a bright star, the lights traveled northbound as they ascended into the sky.  The distance between the two lights was comparable to placing my right hand out in front of my sight line while holding up only my index and pinky fingers.  The lights moved very slowly as they continued to ascend in my direction. Moments later, the lights stopped at a fixed point in the sky.  The lights remained in that position for approximately 15-30 seconds.  At that point, the lights started to slowly ascend in a southeast direction. Not only did the lights move upward, but also away into the southern! sky.  Both lights dimmed at the same time and then disappeared into the clouds. As I started to walk back inside with the dog, I noticed another singular light emerge from the southern horizon.  It was the exact same light that I had just observed.  The light traveled in the same pattern with the same speed.  It stopped in about the same location for a similar pause before heading away as the previous lights had done.  Again, the singular light just faded into the clouds of the night sky. Before I could turn away, I observed a fourth light emerge from the same spot above the horizon. It was the same type of light moving at the same speed as the others.  This time, I opened the back door and called for my wife to hurry outside to get a look at what I was seeing.  The light was still ascending towards me when my wife stepped outside.  She looked on as the singular light stopped in the sky for approximately 15-30 seconds.  Again, she looked on as the light slowly made its way upward and away out of sight.  The whole incident lasted approximately 6 minutes. I have never seen anything like that before.  Neither my wife nor I could explain the absence of navigational lights.  In addition, we could not provide an explanation for either the pulsing orange-yellow glow, or the speed and travel direction that the lights were exhibiting. In the moments following the incident, the partly cloudy night sky cleared up entirely.  Several planes were again observed in the area, but none of them shared any resemblance to what we had just observed.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

All of a sudden the lights converged into a line and went north for a few seconds and disappeared.  I would've thought it was starlink satellites except that they started out stationary and very scattered.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
