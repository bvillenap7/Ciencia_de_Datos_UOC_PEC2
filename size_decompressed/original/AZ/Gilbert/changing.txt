Changing lights in sky, from red/blue light to flare like light.;2014-09-20 19:30:00;5 minutes;changing lights in sky, from red/blue light to flare like light. We were walking our dog and saw 4 lights in sky, 3 were like flares, one was a bluish-redish light.  All four changed numerous times, from the blue/red light to a flare-like light that fell downward.  It lasted about 5 minutes until we couldn't see it anymore because of the trees.  We thought it was odd, that if they were flares, why did they change back to the blue/red light many times?;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Bright glitter/shimmering, long-tailed UFO's in Gilbert!;2014-12-06 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Bright glitter/shimmering, long-tailed UFO's in Gilbert! While in my car between Higley and Ray and Higley and Williamsfield Road saw three bright shimmering objects moving in circular and u shaped motions.  I thought they were fireworks at first because of the shimmer light tail that followed their movement.   They were the color of a white gold shimmer and very bright.  They also resembled shooting stars, but I would say more like a firework display.  They would disappear and return again with their shimmering light display.  It was beautiful.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
As many as 7 Orbs seen ascending and descending, changing colors and flight paths for 30 minutes.;2017-12-31 00:00:00;25 minutes;As many as 7 Orbs seen ascending and descending, changing colors and flight paths for 30 minutes My wife was on the balcony, saw something in the sky and called me outside. When I saw these orbs (4 to 7 at one time) hoverig, then ascending, then descending etc.  I immediately got my phone and asked my wife to get hers.  I knew these were orbs because of the way they moved.  They almost danced in the night sky, one ot two changed from white to reddish, then green, yellow or gold and back to bright white like a star, at first in unison then some faded away, the others then continued to change their position until at the end there were three left which lined up vertically one over the other at which point they merged into one.  When it appeared to be just one it changed into many colors off and on, changed shape and fizzled out and drifted away towards the east and down from our view point.  I have seen other sightings in my life but none his impressive.  We have over 40 pictures. we have viewed these on my PC using zoom of course and have discovered some things ! we had not noticed that night.  These images shoe shape and structure, also lights and dark angles that were at first unseen.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
