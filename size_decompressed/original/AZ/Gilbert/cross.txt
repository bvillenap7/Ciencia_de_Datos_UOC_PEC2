aircraft shadow, but no aircraft.;2003-08-15 11:00:00;10 seconds;aircraft shadow, but no aircraft. In the parking lot of Lowe's @ gilbert and warner an aircraft shadow passed over me as i was parking. out of idle curiosity i looked out the window to see what cast the shadow and saw nothing. no more than two seconds later i stopped and got out to look. i know that it was eleven am because i looked at my watch as i noted the position of the sun. at that time of day i should have been able to see an aircraft whose  shadow passed over me...but i saw nothing in any direction.the sky was neearly cloud-free and i had miles of visbility in all directions. also there was no sound to be heard. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  NUFORC has received many reports of peculiar shadows, allegedly seen streaking across the ground, in cases in which the witness can find no aircraft in the sky.  We do not know what causes them, or if the reports are accurate, but many of them appear to be submitted by serious-minded appearing witnesses.  PD));33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
