Spouse immediately noticed bright lights above us as we were driving.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-22 22:00:00;1 minute;While sitting in the passenger seat of my spouses vehicle, she immediately noticed bright lights above us as we were driving.  She noticed them first as she was driving and focusing on the road, but I quickly attempted to focus in on the lights as well as take out my phone to record it (which I qas lucky enough to do so). Above us were lights moving straight through the sky, it seemed to he somewhat of a cigar shape and made bo noise.  From the looks of the bright blue and red lights, it looked very close, but with the windows rolled down it didn't make a sound.

Ufo monitoring power grid and electricity.;2021-09-02 05:35:00;1 minute;Ufo monitoring power grid and electricity. As I was walking south down a sidewalk on Recker and Guadalupe, I heard an electric surge from power lines above me, and when I looked up there was this silent military sized large drone object hovering about 500-1000 feet above the power lines. At first it kind of floated, and a contraption extended from it, like the head of the robot from the 80s film, Short Circuit, and it seemed to monitor the power lines. Then for about 20-30 seconds the drone remained stationary above the power lines at a hover.  The ufo was the shape and form of a playstation controller.  When I moved north to get a better look at it the ufo did a slight glide manuever and then vanished without a trace.  If it was a drone I would've seen it as it fled but this thing literally just vanished in thin air. I believe it was analysing or monitoring the power grid. I don't think the electric company has sophiscated drones like this to send out and monitor power lines, it was a uf! o!;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
