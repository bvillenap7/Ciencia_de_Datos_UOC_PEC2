Strange fast moving strobe lights across the Phoenix and East Valley skies.;2004-10-09 22:30:00;2 hours;Strange fast moving strobe lights across the Phoenix and East Valley skies. On Saturday Oct 9,2004, my husband and I where outside looking at the clear night sky. I saw a very bright red and blue strobe light coming from the west (over Phoenix) to the east. I went across the sky 10 times faster than an air plain could. In about 1 min. the light was gone. In about 2 min. more there was another one and my husband saw it. He got out our little 30 power scope and when he saw it through the scope it looked like 3 red triangles in the scope. With our eyes we could only see one red and blue light. We took the scope and went to the park by our house where it was clear from any other houses and trees. When we got there at about 23:00 hours we could see three of them come from the west to the east. They seemed to stop over the Superstition Mountians. They stopped in mid air and then went to the south and then very fast up to the east. They would stop and hover and go up and down and left and right. Then all at once there was a larger one that seemed to come up in front of us (we were facing the east) it was larger and brighter than the others.It went to the right and then stopped.It looked to both of us like a deep v. It was strobing red and blue. It would move all around and then it looked as if it was coming closer to us. We saw a total of 6 in the air. I have spent a lot of time watching the ski for the falling stars. I have never seen anything like this. It gave me a sense of fear and excitment. I have seen plains in the sky and it was not a plane of any kind. For one thing plains would not be going that fast and not so close to each other. This was something that we could not explaine.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Three tinted blue lights in shape of triangle. 12AM 3/22/05 Gilbert/Phoenix;2005-03-22 00:15:00;30 Sec;Three tinted blue lights in shape of triangle. 12AM 3/22/05 Gilbert/Phoenix Lastnight I was walking home on a dark street with no lights, I was walking east, it was about 12:15AM at night. As I was walking, and there was a break between trees to the left, so I looked, I saw either one big triangle, or three small circles in the shap of a triangle, I am not exactly sure. It was pretty big, each dot was roughly 2 inches apart in the sky, I could not tell how close it was and was shoked to see it. It was three bright white, tinted blue lights, almost the color of those blue colored car headlights. I stoped at first site of it, at first I thought I was crazy and they might just be three bright stars, I looked around and it was a dirty hazy night and barley any stars in sight, so I looked back at them, and they started fading out and completly disapered. Today, before school, my brothers friend (ryan), who is 20, was talking to my dad. I brought up that I saw a UFO last night and they both looked at each other and said that ryan just got done telling my dad that he saw a triangle at about 12:00AM last night also. We talked about it, and we both saw the same thing. When I got home from school, a friend of ryan called him and the radio station she was listening to was talking about strange lights last night at 12AM, and they were wondering if anyone else saw them, so we called in and let them know. Thats it, So me, my brothers friend, and a radio jocky all saw the same thing.  I am going to see if its out tonight also.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Fuzzy dim cloud moveing South to East, it passed in front of moon then could see a physical triangle shape;2012-05-05 20:50:00;5 sec.;Fuzzy dim cloud moveing South to East, it passed in front of moon then could see a physical triangle shape On the night of 5, May 2012 about 20:50 hours MST, I and two other people saw a “UFO” from our location in Gilbert, Arizona. We first noticed a dim white fuzzy looking cloud overhead and slightly to the East of me traveling South then Southeast into the path of the moon.  As it crossed the face of the moon the object we could see that it's that there was a shape to the object, it turned into a black delta, (arrow head) shape object.  After it passed the moon it returned to the feature that we first saw and continued on an eastward path until it was out of sight. During the entirety of this “UFO” fly-by no sound was heard, no visible aircraft lights were seen, and the craft seemed very high and fast as it flew a curved path from South to East in a matter of about 5 seconds.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

It was very large way to be an aircraft.  The object was about 1000 feet off the ground made no noise we have airports in Mesa and Chandler, Arizona, see and hear airplanes all the time this was not an airplane;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

Three orange lights moving across the horizon in Gilbert;2015-03-29 20:00:00;1-2 minutes;Three orange lights moving across the horizon in Gilbert Was sitting out in the pool visiting my parents in Gilbert for the weekend.  Saw what appeared to be three orange lights in the sky moving in unison.  Two lead lights followed by a seemingly equidistant third light traveling north on the horizon.   We all watched these lights move in seemingly perfect locked formation.  The only thing that changed was the distance between the two front lights, as if a large craft made all three lights and its visible profile or angle was changing.   We watched for a good 2 min until the objects vanished from the sky.   Another couple was out walking in the neighborhood and we chatted over the fence to them on the street, nobody able to explain what we had seen.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Large triangle shape UFO over Gilbert, AZ.;2015-11-21 20:25:00;40 seconds;Large triangle shape UFO over Gilbert, AZ. At 8:25 PM, my three kids and myself witnessed what appeared as three yellowish lights in the southeastern sky.  We were driving on the Loop 202 freeway heading eastbound.  I thought maybe it was three helicopters as we have an increase of military activity on the weekend.   I pointed the lights out to the kids as they approached us.  What flew over us was on black triangle with three lights that had the brightness of streetlights or a tad brighter.  I had the windows down in the car and slowed down to try and identify the craft.  This triangle made no noise at all and was about 1000 feet above us.   The children wanted to know what aircraft is that huge and shaped that way.  I had no answer.  I've seen stealth aircraft fly over at NFL games and this wasn't even close to the size of a stealth.  This was about four street lights long as I stand outside hoping to see this again!   A reference note....I have worked in the airline industry for over 20 years and have never witnessed anything flying like this.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

On the night of April 13th or very early April 14th at about 2 am some unexplainable events began to unfold.;2019-04-14 03:00:00;5 seconds;On the night of April 13th or very early April 14th at about 2 am some unexplainable events began to unfold. First, my wife woke me up because while out on a drive she noticed a bright light in the sky, similar to a star, but slightly brighter...this thing was moving back and forth, up and down, a figure 8, just erratic.  Not super fast usually, fairly subtle mostly to the point thay when I first looked I didn't notice. So, I blow it off and start talking and looked away and she insists I look again.  When I looked back it truly WAS moving erratically!  I could not think of any possible thing that would move like that.  As I stare in awe I begin to adjust my eyes and notice at least 6 other lights but these ones were slighter dimmer than the stars.  They were darting back and forth it seemed!  I pulled my phone out hoping I could use the zoom to see better what was going on.  My phone camera wouldn't pick up the stars or the dimmer lights I mentioned but clear as day you can see the larger light in the sky on the camera.  I have video.  Through the phone camera zoomed at 8x(max) it looked like it was spinning, like looking through glass, and pulsed every once in awhile which in the video seemed to make it disappear for a couple seconds every 15 seconds or so. It stayed in the sky for hours drifting slightly to a different spot of the sky over time and continually moving in unexplainable ways. If I had only seen this, as weird as it was, I would not report it.  However, while this was happening and we're staring at the sky at about a 45° angle, we witnessed something completely unexplainable and in my mind worth reporting. The sky seemed to have gotten darker out of nowhere...we both felt weird and hard to explain but it felt like a void, and a temporary breathlessness.  I had the urge to look up because it looked like something was going to fall on us. It appeared of nowhere and I almost wanted to move out of the way.  Then it just floated there for a second like a blimp flying.  It looked like 5 engines or cylinders all attached and white or silver in the shape of a V.  It didn't make a sound and was either car sized or jet sized. It was hard to tell how far up it was because it was so fast and scary.  It honestly was more like an absence of sound and then it took off at unprecedented speed after gliding or hovering for 5 seconds or so. Our best guess as crazy as I know it sounds...is that a portal opened up and a ship came through.  I had chills.  I would have never heard it if I hadn't seen it and wouldn't have been looking without seeing the star looking ufo's so I feel like it must be connected but idk.  I just don't want to feel like i'm crazy so I need to report it.  My wife saw all the same stuff and felt the same way at the moment that this ufo appeared.  We wont ever forget what we witnessed.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
