Two Boomerang or V shaped crafts with green lights over Gilbert, Arizona;2005-09-14 20:50:00;15 minutes;Two Boomerang or V shaped crafts with green lights over Gilbert, Arizona My wife and I were driving home from Scottsdale, AZ on Wednesday evening September 14, 2005.  It was approximately 8:45p.m. when in the southeast sky I ((name deleted))) noticed a pulsating light, stationary and pulsating. I thought it was very odd to see that sort of light characteristic in the flight path of Sky Harbor airport. It just hung over the San Tan Mountains in the southeast sky. I didn't entertain it much, until after I got home, my wife ((name deleted)) who was behind me, pulled into our driveway and was very excited - she was yelling if I saw the green lights? She said she saw 2 crafts with green lights and the craft was a boomerang or V shaped craft. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the husband, and he seemed to us to both sincere, and credible.  PD));33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
