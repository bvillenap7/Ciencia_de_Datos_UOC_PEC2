Disappearing in a fading smoke.;2005-11-28 22:45:00;15 sec;Disappearing in a fading smoke. Dear National UFO Reporting Center,					11/28/05  		I live in Gilbert AZ. At approximately 10:45p.m. I went out to cover my plants. When I was covering my lemon tree I saw something strange in the south west sky. It was maybe a half mile away, floating low in the sky. It was a sharp angle with a wing with a lip around the edge. It seemed very peculiar. I even looked away and when I looked back it was still floating slowly with no noise or lights. It was not a large air craft, but the color seemed clear or iridescent. The most vivid thing was how it just disappeared. It wasn’t like a blink. It was more like a smoke, fading away slowly. I have never seen any thing ever in my life like it. It’s hard to explain how incredible this was. I’m a normal person, married suburban life with two kids. I’ve never seen anything move like that and just disappear. To be frank it scared the shit out of me.									 			;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Orbs in the sky.;2016-06-15 20:00:00;20 minutes;Orbs in the sky I am former USAF.  I observed what I can only described as orbs going across the sky from 9 to 3 oclock direction wise.  There were quite a few I can not even guess on the number of them.   They were moving at a good pace, but they also would disappear and reappear.  These were not Chinese lanterns because they would not turn off and then back on.   Nor where these aircraft because they were not blinking simply would shutoff for a few seconds then turn back on.   I personally had not seen anything like it.  My wife was also with me and so everything and she was very frightened from it.

Clusters of yellow  lights flying across the sky.;2017-11-05 19:00:00;2 minutes;Clusters of yellow  lights flying across the sky I saw about 10 lights flighing close together across the sky.  I was facing East and they were traveling North.  About three of the lights were flying pretty close together almost like a diagonal line and the others were flying together as well, but it almost looked like they were forming a triangular shape.  I took videos and a picture. I live not too far from an airport and I also saw and heard air planes flying around that time but these didn’t look or sound like planes.  In the video I took you can see the lights flying across and a plane passing so you can tell the difference.  It appears no one else has reported the sighting.  I have emailed my video to ABC news and posted it on their Facebook, but didn’t seem like a big deal.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971

Started with 2 rows of lights and then on row. Hard to explain so I drew it from memory when I returned from my walk. Unfortunately left my phone home. Slow rotation, perfectly spaced out lights in uniform. My dog was off the leash and wasn’t responding strange just wanted to go home before our usual route was over.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
Light pattern simular to the Phoenix lights.;2021-08-02 20:45:00;3 Minutes;Light pattern simular to the Phoenix lights. The object or objects spotted was in the evening while taking out the trash for the evening. As I liked up to look at the stars that evening to judge the weather pattern we had that evening. I noticed amongst the sky very light clouds and one cloud that showed a star like lighting, but in a pattern that stayed with the light cloud formation. As I stopped to watch and think about what I was seeing and then a neighbor who took noticed of what I was doing. I ran into the apartment for my camera, another person from the parking lot was also trying to understand what he was looking at as well. I came out to the both of the to take a photo as the seemed not comfortable with what was being seen and left me there as the object had changed to a multiple light craft to a single light object and the blended in with the stars in the background. The conversation with the others that spotted the object or objects after I did have both persons commented on the fact how far! the object must have been set in the sky to be simular in when the Phoenix light encounter had happen many years prior. From there this is all I am going to say on this subject. What I will say this was very obvious a very large craft to see not only the lights that stood out but the outline of the craft itself.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
