Yellow lights over south Phoenix fade quickly out of sight 2-7-14 apx 21:00;2014-02-07 21:00:00;~2 minutes;Yellow lights over south Phoenix fade quickly out of sight 2-7-14 apx 21:00 My father and i were sitting on my back porch.  I went out to the back yard. as I walked around the pool, I looked in the sky to the west of gilbert arizona, towards south phoenix.  I noticed strange lights. approximately 5 large dark yellow lights in a v shape seem to move towards the east.  There was one light, with the same description, far above and slightly to the north.  It remained stationary.  The lights on the south or left side of the formation moved slightly farther south/left.  Then one by one the lights in the formation seemed to either fade away or move back west until all were not visible.  At that time the light far up above the formation disappeared in the same way.  They each faded in about 5 seconds.  This event happened over approximately 2 minutes.;33.3161786407765;-111.748698300971
