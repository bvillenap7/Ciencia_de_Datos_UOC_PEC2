Silver Cylinder Flying Dark over the Far West Valley;2019-05-24 00:30:00;15 seconds;Silver Cylinder Flying Dark over the Far West Valley Guarding a construction site quite aways out into the desert that doesnâ€™t usually have a lot of air traffic, save a freighter coming to Phoenix every now and again early in the morning. Co-worker and I were sitting in a new area facing the open desert, when I happened to glance up and see what appeared to be a plane or similar flying very low and VERY almost alarmingly slow.  There were no indicator or headlights of any kind, and no noise that would suggest a plane engine.  I happen to have both a flight radar and an Air Traffic Control tower app on my phone, and neither picked up a reading from it or any sort of distress call. It appeared to be a silver cylinder or cigar shaped object headed East towards Phoenix.  The lights from a nearby site reflected off the bottom of it as it cruised over and we watched it for several seconds before it suddenly turned and bolted North into the open darkness VERY quickly.;33.3119;-112.7915
