Dark oval object flashing in the sky.;2020-08-20 05:30:00;5 minutes;Dark oval object flashing in the sky. Early Thursday morning, around 5:30 am. I was checking the security cameras that are mounted on the front of my house.  I noticed a blinking object on the camera that faces east.  It didn't really move.  It flashed for about five minutes then vanished.  I'm including a low quality video.;34.7766;-114.4779
