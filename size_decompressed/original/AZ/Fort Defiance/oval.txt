It felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest!;2013-04-02 21:15:00;10-20 seconds;It felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest! Last week tuesday my friend and I were walking back from my auntie's house - we left her house about 9:05 in the evening.   As we were walking near my uncles house I notice a dark pink (red) glo coming from the sky.  It looked like a falling star, at first I thought it was a star, meter, then a plan, chooper?  Then it started to move back in forth - in a zig zag motion...It seemed like it was trying to hide behind a telephone pole then a tree but we seen it go back in forth in the sky then move out into the dark sky. I'm 45 years old Native American Navajo and this is my first incounter with anything like this and my friend. It moved like a red lazor light - and I'm pretty sure it seen us - just the feeling we feltâ€¦ I felt pressure behind my head and he felt pressure in his back.  It was pretty amazing - Very happy I seen something like this in my life...;35.7393;-109.0689
