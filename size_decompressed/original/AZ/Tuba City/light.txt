Two lights moving west to east, slow and noiseless;2009-09-08 20:00:00;10 minutes;Two lights moving west to east, slow and noiseless While cooking out a half dozen of us, young kids 8 years old to elders, 80 years old, witnessed two lights moving slow and without sound.  They were about five inches off the northern horizon.  The brighter one trailed behind and above.  The dimmer one was closer to the ground.  They traveled at the same speed, and both disappeared below the horizon.  They seem to be located about four miles north of Tuba City, AZ and moved from west to east.;36.1037;-111.2686
