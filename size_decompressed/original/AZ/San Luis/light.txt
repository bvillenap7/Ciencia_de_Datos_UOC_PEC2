Red Objets over the desert sky of San Luis Arizona;2005-12-31 21:30:00;20 Minutes;Red Objets over the desert sky of San Luis Arizona The night of December 31 around 21:30 I was driving and I looked up to the sky and saw three red objects. I took a picture but have not developed the film yet.They were perfectly alined in a triangle and I thought it was one solid object at first until, I saw that they started to blink, move away from eachother and one disapeared. Two were left in the sky and one started to go down as if was a falling star but never went all the way down before it disapeared. The sky was very clear and dark. Yesterday, 01/05/06 around 19:15 there was another sighting. Now there were five of them moving across the sky slowly and I noticed there was an aircraft flying close by those red objects. There was a lot of people watching the sky. I went to the local police station and the dispatcher and an officer were outside looking at the sky and I asked them if they knew what they were and said that they had gotten a lot of calls and did not know what they were. They slowly started to disapear one by one the same way the ones from December 31, 2005.;32.4866999999999;-114.7827
