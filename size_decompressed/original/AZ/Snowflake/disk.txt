They were changing formation and movement as no airplane can do.  When I ran to get binoculars, the friend that was with me, saw 3 of them.  Looking through the binoculars,  I could see they were continuing to change formation.  Before running to get a camera, the last I saw of the front one was that it took off in high gear at a very steep angle upward (nearly straight up).  By the time I came back with a camera, they were gone. What was REALLY eerie is that this exact date was the 42nd anniversary of Travis Walton being abducted by a UFO near Snowflake.  Creepy for sure!  I am not even a person that believed in alien UFO's, but what other explanation is there?;34.4981;-110.0814
