Sighting of craft in night sky twice in Arizona;2004-04-28 21:00:00;15 seconds;Sighting of craft in night sky twice in Arizona I was driving east on Highway 60 in rural Arizona.  I saw the aircraft north of the road just outside Gold Canyon.  At first I thought I was seeing single sparks from fireworks, but then I noticed that there were lights (not illuminating) evenly spaced and rotating then it left my view.  I called my wife on my cell phone and she thought I was crazy.  Then about 15 minutes later I saw the same craft as I was beginning my assent of Gonzales Pass on the south side of Highway 60.  This time it was lower in the night sky and I got scared.  Again it appeared as single sparks of fireworks but it was certainly a craft of some sort and the sparks were light.  The lights did not light up the sky they seamed as though they were running lights.  This area is notorious for military training flights for f-16's.  I wonder if the government is testing new aircraft or if it was something else?;33.2874;-111.0924
