Three stationary lights seen in sky south of Superior;2017-08-30 00:00:00;30 seconds;Three stationary lights seen in sky south of Superior I was headed east on 60 through Superior, AZ.  I took the exit for highway 177 toward Kearny/Winkelman.  I was just at the outskirts of Superior heading south.  The sun had set western sky had some glow, but the eastern sky was relatively dark.  I'm not sure of the exact time, but think it was around 8 pm.  In the sky ahead of me (to the south and slightly east) were 3 yellowish, glowing lights.  They appeared more like a soft yellow star, a bit like a candle flame in color.  They did not twinkle.  They were arranged in a formation that was similar to the stars in Orion's belt.  They were about 60 degrees above the horizon.  I pulled over to watch and after about 10 seconds, they just faded out.  After about 5 seconds, they faded back into view in the same locations.  They did not appear to be moving.  After another 5 seconds, they faded out again.  They did not fly off, nor did they suddenly blink out they faded out over a second or two.  I sat in my truck for another 5 minutes or so and did not see them again.  I worked in and retired from the nuclear power industry.  I performed root cause investigations, self assessments, audits, and technical reviews of procedures and documents. I ended my career working as a consultant in nuclear power.;33.2874;-111.0924
