Stationary vertical bluish white rectangle.;2017-11-12 10:00:00;5 minutes;stationary vertical bluish white rectangle I was traveling south on route 89 towards Chino Valley, Arizona. It was approximately 10a.m. on November 12, 2017.  There were some clouds. I saw a very large bluish white vertically oriented rectangle in the sky.  It was a very defined rectangle.  It was stationary, to the south of my vehicle and stayed stationary there for about 5 minutes.  It was about 45% above the horizon and then it just was not there anymore.  I am a science teacher and have done biological research.;34.7729;-112.4736
