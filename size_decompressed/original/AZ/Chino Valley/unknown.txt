It was at least as big as a school bus. It didn't seem to be made of anything solid, sort of like a black and gray cloud that moved like an octopus.  It came around to the side of our car and passed over the hood and windshield no more than 10 feet off the ground.  It made no sound at all. It followed us for about half a mile.  We couldn't see it anymore but we were spotlighted in a bright, white light.  It must have been above us.  Then it was gone.;34.7729;-112.4736
