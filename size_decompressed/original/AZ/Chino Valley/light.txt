UFO in northern Arizona.;2015-05-02 21:40:00;1 hour +;UFO in northern Arizona. Driving from camp Verdie, Arizona, a bright light appeared in the sky in front of our car heading south.  It remained very bright and stationary for approximately 30 min.  It then dimmed and went completely out.   A few seconds later, it came back on in full brilliance.   Over the following 40 minutes it dimmed and went out only to come back on a total of 3 more times.  Every time it was significantly farther away than before.   We watched it for over an hour.  It never blinked no sounds and no other lights we seen on the craft at all.   I used Google skymap to reference known objects in the sky and there is nothing in its location that can be seen without a telescope or as anything more than a small star.  Also the craft did not twinkle it was a bright stationary light.;34.7729;-112.4736
