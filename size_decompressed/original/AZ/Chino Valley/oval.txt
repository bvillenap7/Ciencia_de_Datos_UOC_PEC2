I know that the onjects I saw where not planes or stars when I am out in chino valley visting the grand kids I look up on clear nights and this is the first time I have ever seen something I did not know what it was and I heard you on the Art Bell show talking about the sighting that night so I hope this helps.;34.7729;-112.4736
