They looked like freeway lights but really high in the sky & were still.  No motion, so we know it couldn't be a plane.   We exited Waddell & turned west.  The light were Still high in the sky & motionless but glowing so bright.   We were confused on what we were seeing, & when we got to the intersection of Cotton & Waddell, we headed South to see what it was.  Still motionless & high in the sky we drove on to get a closer look.   We turned west on Camelback & off of Cotton.  The lights were on our left in the sky, driving slow we watched as the lights from putter to inner just  disappeared into the sky.   And left nothing behind but the empty looming sky as if the lights went into something invisible & just like that vanished ... Leaving us wondering is we were just witness to UFO.
