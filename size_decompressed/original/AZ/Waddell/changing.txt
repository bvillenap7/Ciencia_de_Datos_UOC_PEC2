Multi-colored light became a triangle, then changed direction and disappeared.;2020-05-13 20:00:00;4 hours;Multi-colored light became a triangle, then changed direction and disappeared. A bright light towards the direction of Heber/overgaard from Waddell, AZ that appeared to be a shimmering star, was clearly visible even to my mother without her glasses. The light was flashing too rapidly and brightly to be a nearby planet. After roughly 20 minutes, the light began changing colors from several colors as if in a pattern (red,white, yellow, blue, green, purple), all colors were clearly visible but no distinct pattern. Approximately 30 minutes after the light began to change colors, it appeared to dim or become more distant, which it then multiplied.1 light on top, a second slightly below and to the left or north, and a 3rd at the lowest point in line with the highest or 1st light. All while continuously changing colors. After roughly an hour, it became one flashing light again which eventually dissipated entirely.;33.5707;-112.4411
