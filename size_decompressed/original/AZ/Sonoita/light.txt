Teardrop and light orb U.F.O. crafts near the Moon viewed from S.E. Arizona.;2018-09-21 19:00:00;1/2;Teardrop and light orb U.F.O. crafts near the Moon viewed from S.E. Arizona Sept 21st 2018 from 8:00 - 8:30 p.m.  We were taking turns looking through my husband's telescope.  I was also looking through high powered binocular at clouds around the moon.  I saw something silver that had a 3 dimensional shape, like an elongated guitar pick with a rounded top - as in a canopy on an airplane.  It was between the earth and clouds, the side of it facing the moon was bright silver, then it grayed to black on the side away from the moon.  Then it faded from view, literally after a minute or so, like a dimmer switch on the lamp. We kept looking for it and soon saw two objects traveling together between us and the clouds again.  They looked like balls of light and would slow, then speed up.  Next there were three of them in formation like a triangle.  My husband saw 5 of them in the telescope, I saw 4 by the time I looked through it, but they were flying together in a formation.;31.6752;-110.6151
