My family and I were camping in the park about 9 miles south of Williams. I took my kids out in the wood to spotlight some deer or elk. I and my 14 year old son were looking out one side of the car and my 17 year old son and 11 year old daughter were looking out the other. First the 17 year old said Stop dad, look at that!. My daughter said What is it (son's name)?. By the time I had stopped and got out, it had ducked below the tree line. They both had the same story and discription. A sphere the glowed greenish and had a small tail of light when it moved. It went along the top of the trees then droped out of sight. It scared my daughter alot.;35.5434;-112.1707
