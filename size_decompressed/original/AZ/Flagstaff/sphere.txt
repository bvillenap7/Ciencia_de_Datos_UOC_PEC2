first things first i am not a english major... that said i was driving south towards flagstaff arizona on hwy 89 just past chandler whe;2008-06-01 12:00:00;more than an hour;first things first i am not a english major... that said i was driving south towards flagstaff arizona on hwy 89 just past chandler when i was looking at a strange cloud to my left and saw an object just coming out of that weird skinny cloud. at first i thought i had seen my first weather ballon, it was shinny, round, silver and hovering. still driving 75 miles an hour i watched it as i drove as much as i could. It moved right alomg with me on 89 the whole way to flagstff 45 mn.?but had deceptive speed and stable movement, not fast, but way to smooth for a ballon or plane for that matter , thats the best way i can descibe its movement. at times when looking at the object,a different more distant, smaller faster moving light was present behind it. much of the time my radio station was changing stations but that does happen on the road with a shitty i pod connector but i thought i would at least mention it.I watch it as i pull into flagstaff and park and watch  stay completly still for more than 30 min.im guessing 5000 ft above ground very clearly visable above sunset crater area. im looking around at peaple to see if they see it , nobody.i still dont know why i didnit ask anybody if they see that to but i did not.it was reflecting sunlight of it silver sides, shaded underneath perfect sphere.this basically freaked me out . after 30 min. of watching this parked at dennys i went inside to eat, kind of hoping that when i came out it was gone and it was.later that day drove to havasupi indian reservation to meet friends that were 6 hours behind, sat to wait for them and begin seeing the smaller more erratic moving further distant object that was behind the sphere before . realy quick moving daytime star looking thing.that only lasted for 20 sec.

New Year's Eve 2011 UFO sighting around 8:30 pm south of Flagstaff, Arizona;2011-12-31 20:30:00;5 secs;New Year's Eve 2011 UFO sighting around 8:30 pm south of Flagstaff, Arizona Around 8:20 to 8:40 pm local time, my girlfriend and I were traveling on Interstate 17 Northbound from Sedona to Flagstaff.  About 5 miles south of Stoneman Lake, my girlfriend noticed a glowing sphere moving initially north and then northwest.  I was driving and peered under the top right section of the windshield and saw a large yellow sphere moving parallel to the car then moved very quickly in front and finally disappearing in front of the car.  This all took about 5 secs.  The yellow, slightly greenish sphere was fully illuminated and appeared like a huge falling star or giant fireball.  As it passed our car, the glowing appeared more in front of the sphere like only the semi-circle was lit.  Then when it was fully in the front windshied, only red lights were visible, which made me think it was a plane, but it disappeared in a cloudless night.  If it wasn't for the huge fireball like appearance, I would have thought it was a plane.  The relative size of! the vision was about two times the size of a full moon.  My girlfriend did see the sphere about 2 or 3 seconds more and said the color was changing from green to yellow, though I only saw a yellowish globe.  It traveled mostly parallel to the ground then made about a 30 degree rise as it crossed in front of the car.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
