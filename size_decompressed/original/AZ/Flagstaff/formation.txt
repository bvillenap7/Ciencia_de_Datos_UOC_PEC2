Two Pairs of Lights;2013-08-02 20:30:00;3 minutes;Two Pairs of Lights My family was driving down Silver Saddle Road in Doney Park Flagstaff Arizona.  In looking to the east we saw over Sunset Crater National Park four lights over the craters rim, two pairs of two.  They blinked a few times but were very bright, perfectly circular, and white.  Within a few minutes of us watching they blinked out and were gone.  We arrived home, and I looked up recent Arizona Activity on the internet and found where identical lights had been spotted two days earlier in Tucson, Arizona.  They were identical to the lights seen at this link. http://www.abc2news.com/dpp/news/Copy_of_strange-lights-spotted-over-tucson-and-kansas-city-spark-ufo-speculations1375467105273;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
