A  pitch black triangular shaped craft with a red circular light at each point of the triangle.;1995-04-28 02:45:00;5 min;A  pitch black triangular shaped craft with a red circular light at each point of the triangle. The craft was triangular and pitch black on the bottom with  red circular lights at each point of the triangle.  It made no noise and just seemed to hover.  Cannot judge accurately how far up it was, but it was close enough so I could stick my head out of the passenger side of our semi and see it in detail.  I was just learning to drive a big truck at the time, and was in the bunk sleeping.  My trainer was so excited that she woke me up to validate this object and had me get a closer look.  There was no haze or aura at all around the object, it was just a solid black with the lights at each point of the triangle.  Do not recall seeing any lifeforms at all either. Ever since this experience, I have had eerie feelings sometimes that I am not alone.  I dont know if this is just imagination or what, but it gives me the creeps!!;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
Driving North on Highway 66 and saw a 2 bright white lights.  I asked my husband what it was (we drive home this way every day/night). ;1999-04-27 20:45:00;20minutes+;Driving North on Highway 66 and saw a 2 bright white lights.  I asked my husband what it was (we drive home this way every day/night).  I asked him if it was a pole?  A tower?  The closer we got the slower it appeared to be moving.  I whipped a U turn to follow it.  I caught up with it 40-50mph with the traffic.  Red, blue, green, yellow, white lights blipped like a pinwheel in the wind.  I kept asking well if it's a plane where are the beginning and end lights of the craft.  Then I asked why does it seem to be trapeziod and why do the lights change so much and twirl around like that! I'll explain when ya call, if ya call.  Or I will go into detail tommorow.  I'd just like to found out if there was any military craft in the area.  I'm safe to bet it was a couple of Apache's.  If so, what an awesome piece of equipment!;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657

Large triangular formation of blinking lights, interior dark and no stars visible. Moved slowly south and gently turned east, low engine roar could be heard. Blinking lights ceased as movement towards east began, triangle defined only by three lights at this point. Craft was very large, huge is a better term.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657

I saw a triangle craft that had many lights then flew away a high speed.;2001-12-09 19:00:00;2 min.;I saw a triangle craft that had many lights then flew away a high speed. It was a very large craft triangle in shape I would say about 50 yards long. It had three really bright lights at each corner and a number of other light inside but not as bright. These lights were a piecing yellow in color. I knew it was not a airplane because it was flying very low in the sky I knew this because it was a clear night sky. The thing just stood in the same place for a bit then flew away at a high speed.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657

Golden triangle of lights in Northern Arizona, 2 min duration, silent and then just disappeared;2005-03-21 00:30:00;2 minutes;Golden triangle of lights in Northern Arizona, 2 min duration, silent and then just disappeared I was walking North between buildings at our ranch 30 miles NE of Flagstaff, AZ, when I saw three bright amber/gold lights in a triangular formation about 10-15 degrees above the horizon.  They were straight ahead of me, and although I couldn't really estimate their distance I guessed that they were a few miles away.  I first assumed that they belonged to military aircraft flying in formation, since they were in a patch of sky that was too light to see stars, and they were brighter than any stars and an unusual color that I don't recall ever seeing in the sky before.  I watched the lights for a full minute or two.  They possibly had red or green flickers, and my rational mind was thinking that these could be additional small lights.  I was thinking at the time that the formation moved very slowly, since planes always move, but looking back I'm not sure it moved at all.  After this minute or two, as I watched with mild curiousity, the lights just vanished.  I figured.... um.... well, the planes must have turned to an angle where I couldn't see the lights any more.  I kept watching but they never came back.  The desert was totally silent all this time.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
triangular shape object with lights on all three points moving slowly north bound quik flash and disapeares;2005-10-30 02:30:00;1 minute;triangular shape object with lights on all three points moving slowly north bound quik flash and disapeares Me and my wife were coming back from Phx,Az at 2:30 in the morning I pulled over to stretch my legs when I looked up and saw this large three star Triangle moving above us on the freeway.  I asked my wife if she saw it to and she said, yes.  I freaked out when all three stars light up at the same time and then vanished.  We witnessed this for a whole minute.  This happened just 15 miles south of Flagstaff on I-17.  I called Lowell Observatory later that morning and asked if anyone reported anything strange or if they saw anything that resembled what I saw and was emmediatly laughed at.  This is the second time I saw this object. The first I dismissed for what reason I don't know,  Now I believe we are not alone.

An extremely bright triangular object was seen hovering in the sky at dusk on Wed. June 15 near Flagstaff, Az.;2009-06-10 19:05:00;at least 1 hr;An extremely bright triangular object was seen hovering in the sky at dusk on Wed., June 15, near Flagstaff, Az. While driving on Highway 17 coming from Flagstaff, going South toward Sedona, we saw a stationary object which was extremely big and bright rather low in the Western sky. We watched it for many miles until cloud cover obscured it.  It appeared to be shaped like an inverted triangle.  It was far brighter than anything else in the sky and was visible while it was still light out.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
Three yellow lighted hovered next to my car very close!;2014-10-15 19:30:00;5 minutes;Three yellow lighted hovered next to my car very close! Saw at first with my girlfriend going back to our car.  It was flying very low about 200 yards away, but thought it was a plane.  Didn't realize what it was until we drove towards it on a different road.  It was hovering very close to the ground it was 100 yards from us.   Then It came closer to us around 50 ft.   I could see every detail it was triangle shaped but at the same time the outer parts were square shaped.  It flew very different from any other plane I have seen and closer to the ground too.  It had a yellow lights on every corner with some other red ones on the bottom.  It sounded like a muffled jet plane and for how close it was I could hear it hovering. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) 730 pm sorry about that ((END ADDENDUM));35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
