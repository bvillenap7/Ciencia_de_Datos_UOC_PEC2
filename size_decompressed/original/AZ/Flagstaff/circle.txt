Other object very bright white--thought it was Jupiter. Both 25 degrees above the horizon in Western sky. After 35-40 mins. white object shot to the North and winked out. Simultaneously at least 6-8 other dull yellow objects in sky in almost all directions. Partially cloudy skies during sighting. Direction--West and Northwest of Flagstaff. Red & green object appeared to communicate with white object through flashes of light. Myself, wife, daughter, son and 3 next door neighbors witnessed this event. I am 51 and was outside looking in the sky to the West Northwest. I noticed a red and green flashing object about 25 degrees above the horizon. Turned away for a minute or two, object is still there in the same place. Simultaneously there is a very bright white object about 40 degrees to the West of this , I'd say due West geographically. I thought this to be a planet (Jupiter?). This object was stationary the whole time. After observing for a few minutes I looked at my watch, it was 20:48 MST. My 15 yr old neighbor was visting my 14 yr old son, and came out of my house. I asked him to come take a look. We both watched for about 10 mins. Green and red object started moving at this time. I went in and got my 7x35 binoculars. We were then joined by the neighbor's Mom and 15 yr old sister. We all watched this red and green object move. A little zig-zag, some up and down motion. It shot off several times and winked out, only to reappear in the spot it winked out from. In the binoculars it looked like a red and green ring, like a wedding band with a yellow white spot like a diamond on a wedding ring. It was turning. I sent for my wife son and daughter to come out. Now there were 7 of us watching. The red and green object shot off beams of light several times. Keep in mind these are objects are miles away so everything looks pretty small, the beams were distinguisable, but not real intensely bright. About 21:15 we started looking in other areas in the sky and spotted 6-8 other moving objects. I looked at several through the binoculars. Looked like the edge of a ring. Dull yellow to tan color, not real bright. About 21:20 the bright white object I thought was Jupiter, suddenly shot to the North and winked out while in motion. It did not reappear. By 21:30 the sky was getting very cloudy, and observation was concluded. I have no fears about being contacted by you or answering further questions. I have not reported this to any Law Enforcement agencies, Military or Newspapers. Please advise proper course of action to follow. Sincerely ((Deleted));35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
Bright white, circular orb flew out from behind a contrail (chemtrail), then flew back behind it.;2008-10-19 11:10:00;7 seconds;Bright white, circular orb flew out from behind a contrail (chemtrail), then flew back behind it. We were driving southbound on I-17, just south of Flagstaff.  I was seated in the passenger seat looking out of the window up at a contrail (chemtrail) made by a plane that was flying from east to west. This contrail was almost directly overhead of us. As I stared at the contrail, a bright white, round orb/ball flew out from behind the contrail going slowly south.  It didn’t fly south very far at all, maybe for 4 seconds, and then turned at a 45 degree angle and flew back up behind the contrail.  I stared at the spot until the contrail dissipated but there wasn’t anything there. This happened very fast and would’ve been easy to miss if I hadn’t been looking directly at the spot.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
shining red and blue light in western sky, circular, ring, spinning;2011-09-20 20:40:00;55 minutes;shining red and blue light in western sky, circular, ring, spinning Prior to Jupiter rising, we noticed in the west, about 20 degrees above the horizon, an incredible emanation from what from our perspective is the location of the star, Arcturus.  The obvious red and blue flickering was noticeable compared to all the other stars.  At first we assumed it must be a plane transiting west to east.  After ten minutes of observation we determined the object appeared to be celestial, not sky based, as it appeared to be setting.  We obtained a mediun powered optic and upon mounting the optic on tripod, we saw the object more clearly.  It was a ring of light, with smaller colors of blue and red, seemingly spinning.  We had never seen anything like it, and immediately called an astronomer associate and asked him if he could locate the object. His location is approximately 12 miles northwest of us, and we assumed he would immediately locate the object and view it with greater magnification.  he could not locate it, leaving us to deduce! the object was not clestial, and must have been sky-based.  This was one of the most remarkable experiences either one of us has ever experienced.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
