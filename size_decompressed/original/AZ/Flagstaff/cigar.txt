Silver Cigar shaped UFO near Mt. Elden.;2014-11-05 14:00:00;5 minutes;Silver Cigar shaped UFO near Mt. Elden I saw a small. silver, cigar  shaped craft, slowly flying in front of Mt. Elden, heading to the south east.  It was like a silver, oblong, oval, capsule moving slowly enough, it mimicked the speed of a hang-glider.   It continued heading southeast, for about 4 and half minutes, until I looked away for a second and it was gone.  I had seen similar shaped things, a couple of weeks prior, only at night and going in the opposite direction heading north west in the night sky and then slowly truning to the south west and disappearing.  They were lit up silver, cigar shaped and there were 3 of them.   At the time, I didn't think much about it, but now, having seen another one in the daylight, I kind of confirmed it for myself.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
