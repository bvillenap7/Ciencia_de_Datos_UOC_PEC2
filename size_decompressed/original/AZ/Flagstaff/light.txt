It traveled at about the same speed we were going and continued along with us for about five to seven miles.;1997-01-26 22:00:00;six minutes;I had been wondering for years if there was a place to report sightings. This sighting occured either on the 26th or 27th of January 1997. My family and I were moving from Altus AFB, Oklahoma to Travis AFB, California. I was driving a big yellow Ryder moving van, I believe a 26' truck, with a base station CB radio installed and my wife was driving our black Dodge Caravan with a regular CB radio installed. We were traveling west bound on Interstate 40 between the times of 0800pm and 1045pm, and were between Flagstaff, Arizona and Barstow, California, when a bluish/green light appeared about 400 to 600 yards to the south. It was the color of the stars or planets. I thought it was a train coming towards us at first, But it was traveling the same direction we were traveling so this was no train. The light was about at the same level as our vehicles. It traveled at about the same speed we were going and continued along with us for about five to seven miles. After it disappeared, I called to my wife on the CB radio and said, Did you see that? She replied, I thought it was just me. I said, No, I was watching it too.  We continued on to Barstow, California and stayed there for the night. Still to this day, we have no idea of what the object was.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
Stationary star light began to travel in straight lines;1997-07-16 00:00:00;15 sec.;Stationary star light began to travel in straight lines This may be moot because it was so long ago but I didn't realize you existed until now, for reporting. I did a search for a similar sighting in my area at this time and did not find one. Midnight over a dark-sky location, very clear night. I was watching the stars above me, when one of the lights which had been completely stationary, began to move in a straight line to the east. Then it made and abrupt turn to the north, then to the east again, then disappeared. It did appear exactly as a bright star in degree of light,size, color and distance from Earth. This is my second sighting, the other occured about 30 years ago in California and was a traveling red orb along a freeway for about 2 miles at night in the Escondido vicinity, many drivers reacted to it by swerving out of their lane - I could see their lights behind me. I am not a ufo chaser.  I saw what I saw and that is all there is to it.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657

A satellite emitting very large, camera like flashes?????????;2001-09-08 22:30:00;5-7 minutes;A satellite emitting very large, camera like flashes????????? My friend works in Northern Arizona watching for fires from a fire-tower. We were sitting outside facing east watching satellites, shooting stars, the occasional plane etc. My friend sitting to my right pointed out a small light, moving along the same path as the previous satellites we had seen earlier in the evening. He said he saw it flash very brightly like a huge camera flash going off. We all began to watch it as it flew in a straight line from south to north. It was quite dim until bam, we saw it flash, extremely bright, actually exactly like a very, very big camera flash. Again it would dim out and then zap, another great flash. It did this probably 6 or 7 times before it left our view to the north. What was peculiar was the fact that it seemed to be a satellite however I've never seen a satellite emit a high powered flash before. I thought maybe a plane of some kind but it would have been at a tremendous altitude and it had no beacon lights or flashing lights common on aircraft, just a dim steady light until the big flashes. Has anyone else seen anything like this???? ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witnesses were observing the fluctuating reflection off the side of a tumbling rocket casing.

Light beam in twilight sky;2002-03-14 19:00:00;1 minute;Light beam in twilight sky On the evening of March 14, 2002, I was returning from a day at the Grand Canyon National Park and was driving south on Highway 89 heading back toward Flagstaff, Arizona.  I was somewhere between Gray Mountain and the Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument, when I witnessed a very strange light to my right in the dusk sky that looked like some sort of flying aircraft, but I couldn't really see anything of the craft except an very bright light being emitted from its underside, down in a beam like pattern for perhaps 100 feet, although it is very difficult to judge distances in the sky.  It was not completely dark yet, but the light was certainly bright enough to stand out much more than any faint stars in the distance.  I would estimate the object to be a few thousand feet high, and to the south of the object a mountain peak in the distance gave some sense of depth and height perception.  I was driving about 80 miles per hour and the area is quite flat as you head back to Flagstaff, and I studied the object for about 20 seconds, while trying to determine whether it was a plane or some sort of hovering helicopter.  I thought perhaps the craft was heading back to the Grand Canyon Airport, but it didn't seem to be moving at all. On the horizon, out where the Grand Canyon airport could be, maybe 60-80 miles away, I could see a blinking light that most definitely an airplane off in the distance.  It occurred to me that as I looked at this craft, it looked surprisingly enough just like a flying saucer would if it were hovering and just emitting a large beam of light from its underside.  The beam spread out from the bottom of the object in a solid ray pattern, and I realized that I should take a picture of it with my digital camera.  As I began to slow down the car, which took about 20 seconds, there were some trees on the side of the highway that kept interrupting my view of the craft slightly.  As I was pulling past the sparsely populated stand of trees I could see that the light was beginning to rise slightly in the sky and a cloudy material was beginning to surround it.  In less that 10 seconds, the light rose probably several hundred feet, and as it did the cloudiness, or smoke, or whatever enveloped it.  Before I even got my camara turned on, it just disappeared in the smoke, the light was gone, and I couldn't see anything else in the twilight, except still the blinking light of an airplane very far in the distance on the horizon.  I sat there mesmerized for a couple of minutes, trying desperately to see something else, but could see nothing, and then I was trying to determine if the cloudiness around the ship was really clouds or not.  There were a few clouds in the distance, but none at all in that area of the sky.  While I watched, the foggy sort of cloudiness eventually dissepated, within about five minutes it was gone and the area where the craft had been was clear and open sky. I was very dissapointed that I didn't get a picture of it, I'm not really sure what I saw, but it was definitely not any sort of flying object I'd ever seen.  I told my fiancee Lorie about it that night, and she didn't really know what to think about it.  I have been very hesitant to submit this report, and was actually waiting for a while to see if anyone else reported seeing the object on the same night.  I felt that I should at least give an account of what I saw in case anyone else witnessed it.  I have no explanation for how it vanished, and I admit that it sounds very skeptical that it disappeared before I could even get a picture of it, but as God is my witness, this is a true account of my experience on that night.  I am a chiropractor in Ontario, Canada, and was actually on a trip to look at offices for sale because I will be relocating to the western United States this year.  I had taken a day off to go to the Grand Canyon and was returning from my sightseeing day there when I witnessed this unidentified flying object.  I will not forget what I saw and it was unlike anything I expect to witness again.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
smal amber light to the north north east part of flagstaff;2002-11-29 19:40:00;3 minutes;smal amber light to the north north east part of flagstaff I was driving home from coffe with my freind ans we saw what looked at first like a star,about as bright a venus but amber colored. Then we relised the sky was filled with storm clouds( slightly purle light a snow storm). It was stationary and to the north north east part of the sky. just slightly east of the peaks. as we pulled onto the main street, Route 66, then it seemed the move straight  away from us  until we could not see it ( this lasted about 2 second) It did not look like a landing lights turning off, it was to slow for that, but we looked for a few seconds just in case to look for the flashing lights of an air plane but nothing was there, and the airport was pretty far away in the oposit direction.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
Red and Blue lights moving across they sky in the shape of a crecent moon;2004-01-29 10:40:00;1-2 minuets;Red and Blue lights moving across they sky in the shape of a crecent moon I was getting ready for bed when I saw a very bright star out of the upstairs window. It almost looked like it was throbbing, if that makes any sence.  I had to let the dog out anyway, so decided to get a better look.  I was outside for about a minuet and then I saw these blue and red lights clusterd together in a vauge shape of a crecent moon.  I didn't see where the lights came from, but they moved at what seemed to me to be a very fast speed across the sky going from East to West.  It took them about 6-8 seconds to move from the East most point of my vision of the sky to the West most point of my vision of the sky.  The lights were at a lower altitude than the star.  I am not even sure if what I saw wasn't a plane.  That is the explanation for everything....it must have been a plane  Of course I live where there are a lot of tall trees obstructing my vision so who knows, but in my gut I don't think it was a plane. There were too many red and blue lights.  This thing was bigger than any plane I have ever seen, and it was moving faster than I have ever seen a plane fly.  I don't know what it was. I do know that it frightened me a little, and I still feel a little funny about it.  This was only last night.  I am almost a little scared to go to sleep tonight...lol.  If anyone else has seen anything weird in the sky they should definatly post it.  After reading all of these I feel a little less crazy  Even my sister thought I had lost my marbels when I told her.  It is good to know that I am not the only one who has seen weird stuff in the sky.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
Observed what appeared to be a bright, slow satellite do a 180 degree turn.;2004-07-05 21:43:00;Approx 1 min.;Observed what appeared to be a bright, slow satellite do a 180 degree turn. I was sky watching in my front yard in west Flagstaff around 2115 hours, Monday, July 5th, 2004.  I spotted five satellites in less than five minutes.  All exhibited the basic characteristics of satellites regarding speed, distance, and size.  Soon after spotting the last one of these, I noticed another coming from the south and moving towards the area of the night sky near the handle of the Big Dipper constellation.  I immediately tried sighting it through my binoculars (10x50) using the normal technique of aiming in front of the object (ahead of it along its apparent trajectory), assuming it had a straight line trajectory as satellites do.  I noticed also that it seemed slightly brighter than the other satellites I'd seen that evening (about twice as bright) and that it was moving about 1/3 to 1/2 less than the speed of the previously spotted satellites.  I couldn't see it through my binoculars, and lowered them.  I could see it easily with the naked eye however, yet each time I lifted the binoculars to the area where it should have been travelling, I couldn't find it.  I kept lowering the binoculars, recapturing it with my unaided eyesight, then lifting the binoculars again, only to lose sight of the object.  After four or five attempts, I gave up trying to spot it with the binoculars and just eyeballed it.  Then I discovered why the object was hard to track.  As it was travelling toward the north, it was also turning slightly to the right (east).  When the object reached the point in the sky where its apparent position was between the two outermost stars which make up the handle of the Big Dipper, it began a slow but tighter turn toward the east.  It completed this turn after a course change of about 180 degrees, and then continued heading back toward the south.  The object completed this 180 degree turn when it reached the point in the sky where its apparent position placed it in between the four stars which make up the scoop or dipper part of the Big Dipper.  Thus, the apparent diameter of this 180 curve ascribed by this object was the apparent distance from in between the first and second stars of the Big Dipper's handle to the middle of the Big Dipper's scoop.  There was no sound associated with this object.  I've never seen a satellite do that before... or, was it a satellite?;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
on or around this date my brother-in-law and I were trashed and up late. not so trashed however as to not know what we were seeing. at;2005-04-01 03:00:00;unknown;on or around this date my brother-in-law and I were trashed and up late. not so trashed however as to not know what we were seeing.  at first it wasnt too special. it just looked kinda like a star above the city of flagstaff. we are on the outskirts and have a good view in that direction.  then at about 3 am my brother came running in the house with my binoculars and at about the same time i noticed out my front window, a multi-colored ball of light that was previously above flagstaff began to descend into the city. it dropped into the city several times and back above it. it moved around in a very jerky kind of choppy path. it bounced around in the sky just above the treeline and was obviously entering the city proper.  I have witnessed things in the sky like this before. this was no helicopter or plane/jet. it was a genuine ufo. I believe they are here above flagstaff often too. but this was the only time I witnessed this thing actually demonstrating obvious ufo properties of movement.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
We saw an orange light moving around in the sky and going out twice, for about ten minutes.;2009-04-04 21:00:00;Ten minutes;We saw an orange light moving around in the sky and going out twice, for about ten minutes. We were in a parking lot, about to get into our car and go home, when I looked up and saw an orange light in the sky. I thought that it might be a planet, as it was too big to be a star, and it wasn't white or yellow- closer to red or orange. The sky was completely clear, and as we were looking at the light, we noticed that it was moving slightly, back and forth. Then, it went out completely for a few seconds, and flickered back to light. We drove back home, assigning the person in the backseat to keep an eye on the light, and watched it until it disappeared behind Mt. Eldon.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657

On Saturday May 11, 2013, I was stargazing in Flagstaff. What I thought was a star started to move.;2013-05-11 22:00:00;30 minutes;On Saturday May 11, 2013, I was stargazing in Flagstaff.  What I thought was a star started to move.  I thought it must have been a commercial airplane.  It was really high up.  It would move forward, just suddenly to the right and left, and then go in reverse.  It eventually would stop, maintain its position for a few minutes, and then proceed to travel again, with the same unusual flight patterns.  This happened for at least 30 minutes.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
There was a bright light in the night sky that would appear, disappear and then reappear in a random pattern.;2019-06-24 20:00:00;10-20 minutes;There was a bright light in the night sky that would appear, disappear and then reappear in a random pattern. Standing on line to look through the main telescope at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, several of us in the crowd observed a bright light in the night sky. It would shine for a few seconds, disappear then reappear a few seconds later in a different but nearby spot. The pattern seamed random and most people thought it was an conventional aircraft. I have spent decades around aviation, from propeller to jet to rockets and space shuttles. I know of no aircraft or natural phenomenon that could maneuver, disappear and reappear like this object. I observed the event 10-20 minutes.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
