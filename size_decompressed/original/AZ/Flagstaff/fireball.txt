It then made a gentle turn to the north and gradually went out of my field of view.  The object appeared in the south west heading in a north easterly direction before turning to the north. I was camping 20 miles south east of Flagstaff.  It was 21:28 hrs on a very clear night.  I was watching the sky before bed when i saw what appeared to be an average burn up of a small meoteorite into the atmosphere.  I have seen many of these and was admiring the show of trailing fire and debris.  It then changed into a blinking average star size object. It was to high and far away to distinguish any shape.  It made a gradual turn to the north and I watched it until it got low enough above the horizon and out of sight.  I was blown away.  I know it wasn't the shuttle.  It was something that entered the atmosphere and was under some type of control.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
