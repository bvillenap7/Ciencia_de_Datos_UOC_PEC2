Two craft seen over flagstaff. one craft had a lage ligh come on in the center . . .;1995-08-15 20:00:00;3 minutes;Two craft seen over flagstaff. one craft had a lage ligh come on in the center . . . The dates above are a guestimate. It was some time ago when I saw this but thought I should document it as it was the most dramtic. I have had two other sigtings, one prior to this report and one afterward. My first sigting was in Scottsdale, AZ about Summer of 1982. I saw three red light that were in a triangular formation that spanned about the space of 3 to 4 football fields. It made no sound and was much lower than any aircraft would have flown. The odd thing is is that the three lights flew as if it was one craft. YOu could not focus on the space between the tiagular shaped lights. It flew off slowly over the Pima Indian reservation.  My second sigting, the one mentioned in this report was near Flagstaff, Arizona while camping. Two craft came over a bluff moving very slow. They were oval shape (I am not sure if they were oval shape or circular as I saw them from an angle) with the perimeter out lined in singular lights. After moment when the craft came over the bluff then came military jets moving at much greater speed and passing the craft. The two ships did a semi-circle around our position and went back over the bluf again. As they started to go over the bluff in the center of one of the craft a warm colored light came on and the faded off as if it was like a dimmer switch. the light in the center was about a 1/3 the size of the craft itself. The strange thing about this is I don't remember falling a sleep that night and was awoken a couple of hours later by a third person who was meeting us at our camp site. I don't remember falling a sleep.  The third time I saw somthing was the event over the Phoenix Valley a few years ago. I awoke out of a sleep and walked to the window and saw the lights over what looked like camelback mountain (I was in the east valley.) Why would I have awoken out of sleep to see this? Anyway, People think I am full of it when I tell them these stories but two out of three times I was with another person.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
oval shaped with some kind of bumps on top;1999-09-01 17:00:00;20 minutes;oval shaped with some kind of bumps on top While leaving a friend's home in the country about 30 miles outside of Flagstaff, AZ my daughter and I stopped because we saw this weird looking thing flying around in the sky.  It didn't travel very far but went back and forth.  It went quickly and slowly. It was about a mile from us.  We do have a picture but it isn't a very good one. We watched it for about 20 minutes.  My daughter pointed at something else in another direction which I turned to look at.  When I looked back only a few seconds later, the object was gone. It was not a helicopter or a plane. I am certain that it wasnt the proverbial weather baloon.   I am just now reporting it because my husband has encouraged me to do so.

Bumbling light in the sky at 40 degrees;2000-05-25 02:30:00;3 hours?;Bumbling light in the sky at 40 degrees I have a retreat (cabin) in northern Arizona. This is in Valle arizona at the intersection of hwy 64 & hwy 180.  I went outside to urinate at 2:30 in the morning. Directly at about 40 deg.in the eastern night sky was a very bright object somewhat round. It was stunningly noticeable as it was shaking somewhat violently kind of reminded of the way a bumble bee moves in flight.   At first I took it to be a regular type of aircraft.  I thought I might have to help the occupants of a aircrash because I thought this aircraft was in trouble.  that was until it came to a complete halt.  At that point I knew this thing was special.  In this area it is extremely quiet especially at night, There was absolutely no sound to this vehicle.  At times it seemed to move from this halted position.  I could not detect how it got from A to B but I could tell it was not staying put.  Its luminescent quality would jump in magnatude for a very brief period. I could tell this light could light up the sky if it wanted to.  You could sense it tremendous power.  The lighted object did not bumble after the initial sighting.Later two other object much more faint but with exactly the same luminescence came close to the original object and banked at 45 deg angle at a ridiculously fast rate of speed (like lightning)sped off and dissapered.  When the objects got close to eachother they seemed to exchange energy sort of like static electricity in a way.  The main object seemed to climb but very slowly.  It stayed in position in the same portion of the sky but more like 70 deg.  It was still there very bright but seemed higher and farther away.  It was there when the sun came up and all other stars etc, where long gone. I did not see it leave.  I went to work in Williams, AZ. and left the scene. This area has a wonderful black night sky with many bright stars.  The main object was the brightest object in the sky. It had none of the usual red and green beacons as on regular aircraft. No sound, this area is so quiet you can hear an airplane many miles away if it is flying by.  I noticed I had a hard time telling how close it was. Could of been 10, 20  or 50 miles away or maybe 3.  It was hard to tell. Its light was backlit like a stage light. Definately not an incandescent beam (like an aircraft or car) I will never forget it.

Oval object in photo appears when you increase resolution to the left top side of photo in the sky.;2008-10-15 00:00:00;picture;Oval object in photo appears when you increase resolution to the left top side of photo in the sky. I was looking at the Flagstaff, AZ wikipedia website and clicked on the photo view of Flagstaff from Mars Hill and in the top left side of the photo above a hill in sky is an oval object.  Now I understand that this photo has to have been seen by hundreds of people but I thought since its there I thought I'd pass it on to you guys.  Here is a link to the photo at wikipedia even if it is a hoax or unexplained it sure does pop out at you and in my understanding it looks like an unidentified object. link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flagstaff_AZ_from_Mars_Hill.jpg ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the time of the sighting is approximate.
