An Aubrun red dot floated scilently to the right and then darted off to the left and disaapeared;1997-11-22 06:00:00;a few minutes;Summary : An Aubrun red dot floated scilently to the right and then darted off to the left and disaapeared I work at a conveniece store/gas station off of Hwy 180.  I work the early morning shift and at this time of year the sun hasn't risen yet.  I have been watching the sky a lot lately due to some very strange looking airplane lights, we have had a great deal of air activity lately.  Anyway, was watching a regular plane flying in the North and then I turned around to take the unleaded gas reading when I looked up and saw an auburn red dot floating across the sky.  At first I thought it was a falling star, because there was no sound, but then it darted to the left, not slightly it was a very fast long movement, and then it just disappeared.  It was very graceful and strange to stay the least.  My descriptions is a single working Mom.  I don't know if this is something or not, but I hope it helps.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657

At 7:41 p.m. mst a bright flare type light was seen four degrees below Polaris. 35 years of amateur astronomy and I've never seen that.;2000-09-22 19:41:00;three seconds;At 7:41 p.m. mst a bright flare type light was seen four degrees below Polaris. 35 years of amateur astronomy and I've never seen that. I'm curious... what was this bright magnitude -3 light... that quickly faded. No way it was a satellite... but maybe a military flare? Anybody else in AZ see this? I hate the ufo cult stuff but this must have been something...;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
Two UFOs over Flagstaff in the Constellation of Cassiopeia;2008-09-28 19:23:00;1 minute;Two UFOs over Flagstaff in the Constellation of Cassiopeia Tonight at about 7:23 pm Arizona Time, over the northeast sky of Flagstaff, my wife and I saw something that we can't quite explain in the night sky. We were taking a walk around our neighborhood in Flagstaff when I looked up at the northeast night sky and saw the constellation Cassiopeia. I immediately noticed something odd. Cassiopeia looks like a W or a crown in the night sky but it looked much different tonight. I immediately noticed what looked like two bright stars (about as bright as Jupiter was tonight) in the bottom left hand of the W. They looked like two bright white satellites only they weren't moving. We watched them for probably 10 to 15 seconds and they didn't appear to move at all which I knew was strange. Then they slowly moved in formation off to the northeast and got dimmer as they moved that direction. I kept track of them for a while but then lost them. They seemed to be high up there like they were in space, and there were no blinking lights so they couldn't have been planes. If they were planes, they sure didn't move like them, sitting still and then moving. My wife and I both saw these objects and couldn't explain what they were. The whole thing lasted for about a minute from when we first saw them to when they started moving and disappeared.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
