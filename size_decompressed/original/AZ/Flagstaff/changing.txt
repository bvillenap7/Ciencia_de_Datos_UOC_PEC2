Shape in sky disappearing and reappearing.;2013-11-03 20:00:00;20 minutes;shape in sky disappearing and reappearing My husband and I  are going down 40 in AZ..NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY.  The sun is setting but its not dark yet.   We see something that looks like teeny cloud..but we get a little closer and it was v shaped..all of a sudden, it disappeared!!   Then..about 3 minutes later..it starts to reappear..its taking the shape of a cloud..getting blacker and blacker..shape changing..it has a glow behind it..like an aura...then it fades away..gone!   This is a completely straight stretch of road..each whole process completes itself in about 3 minutes..in all my life..I've never seen something like this.   Happened 3 times.  The aura seemed to stretch and move.;35.1991365671642;-111.632196268657
