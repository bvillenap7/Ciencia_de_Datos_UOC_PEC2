I have a game camera set up to monitor traffic on the main dirt runway.   Every few weeks, I pull the chip to see what pictures are on it.   The camera is set to take 3 pictures “as fast as possible” when the unit is triggered.   This is about 1-2 seconds between pictures.   The triggered pictures are noted A, B & C at the bottom of each.    On July 16th at 2:17 am the camera snapped 2 pictures of something I cannot explain, and for whatever reason it did not snap the 3rd “C” picture.    I’m sending the 2 pictures along with a daytime picture of the runway for comparison.  Of interest to me is the fact that whatever the object is it does not appear to be moving,  it’s in the same place in both pictures.   At first I thought it must be some kind of bug on the lens,  but the camera lens and the trigger lens are 2 different things in 2 different places on the camera.    Also, I live on t! he border of 2 Military Operations Areas (MOAs) and I can sit out on my porch and watch the F16’s and F35’s out of Luke Air Force base in their night time training as they launch their flares and chaff.  This is not that.   These pictures are looking west into the MOA,  but the object has to be near the camera for it to trigger.;33.9047866666667;-112.842633333333
