AZ near Kingman 20 minutes  white orbs in a row in the sky;2008-07-25 02:00:00;20 minutes;AZ near Kingman 20 minutes  white orbs in a row in the sky We were driving from Wickenburg AZ to Kingman AZ about 2:00 AM.  Off to our left a single white round light appeared in the sky a few moments later another one appeared next to it than another one till there were about six or seven holding in one place no movement  or sound.They stayed in place for about twenty minuets in a slight arch formation.We felt we were being watched by the lights.  They were luminescent not blinding in any way.  Then one by one starting with the last light that appeared was the first to disappear one by one in order they went out.  We tried to take a picture with a camera phone and could not get it to work.It worked fine latter that night.;33.9047866666667;-112.842633333333
