4 yellow lights, aligned in a crescent shape appeared, then disappeared.;2006-10-02 19:53:00;4 minutes;4 yellow lights, aligned in a crescent shape appeared, then disappeared. At 7:51 pm,I was driving Northwest on Hwy 60 to Wickenburg from Phoenix, and my 11 year old daughter, and 8 year old step-daughter, and myself saw what seemed to come out of nowhere, 2 yellow lights, perfectly spaced, that looked like it was making a turn in the sky. They lasted about 10-15 seconds, then just disappeared. There weren't any clouds in the sky that it could have gone behind, it was just gone. We continued to search the sky for it, but were unable to find it again. Then at 7:53, 3 lights, perfectly aligned in a crescent shape lit up again, maybe for 3 seconds, then a forth one lit up, in alignment. They stayed there for probably 10 seconds ( long enough for me to stop in the middle of the highway). Then as fast as they were there, they disappeared. Again, for the next 10 minutes, we searched the sky, but couldn't find anything. I am sure that the first object was a single one, because of the way the lights moved together, but I am unsure if the second one was one complete, or four seperate ones.;33.9047866666667;-112.842633333333
