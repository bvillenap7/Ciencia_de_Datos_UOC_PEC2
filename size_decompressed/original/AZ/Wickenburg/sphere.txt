yesterday's sighting has made me a believer;2009-05-18 16:30:00;1.5 hours;yesterday's sighting has made me a believer My wife and I were coming home from Phoenix to Wickenburg (about 30 miles) last night. Right after the sun had set we noticed a bright light in the sky over Wickenburg. It may have been there as we watched the sun go down but we didn't notice it. At first we thought it might be a balloon and the sun was reflecting off it, but it didn't move and it was way to high in the sky. There was some clouds in the sky but it was clear in the immediate area of the object. The objects light looked something like a blue flourescent light would give off only much brighter. I called 911 and asked if there were any reports of anything unusual in the skies over Wickenburg. She said no, but someone had reported something like a ballon over Cave Creek (north Phoenix). At the same time, my wife called a friend of ours in Morristown (halfway to Wickenburg) and had her step outside to observe it. She said there had been reports of lights in the sky, in the same area and at about the same time for the last few days. We continued to watch it and as we got to Wickenburg, we saw people on the sidewalks and parked cars with people outside watching it too. About 45 minutes had passed by now and I went to my back yard and continued to watch it. My neighbor was outside too, and I drew her attention to it. We continued to watch for another 15 or 20 minutes. I took a picture with my phone and the sky took but the object didn't. As we were observing it a jet flew by in the general area  of the object, about 30,000 feet or so, (the passengers must have hadf a real good view of it) and it looked to be 6 or 7 times bigger than the jet. I observed something like a red or orange glow and within a minute, it moved straight away from us and looked mlike a star ant then was gone. There were no stars out yet.;33.9047866666667;-112.842633333333
