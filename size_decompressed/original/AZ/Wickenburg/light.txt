Orange ball bouncing up and down, side to side. Changed to green and a few other colors.;1979-11-11 19:30:00;At least 1 Hour;Orange ball bouncing up and down, side to side. Changed to green and a few other colors. November 11, 1979. Driving in Arizona, saw a bouncing light across the highway. Pulled over off the road, about 30 other cars were also stoped, people were driving by and asking us if we saw it too. Our group was about 6 people, all of us saw something a little different, but it was one light, couldent tell how far. Bouncing up and down side to side. At least 50 other people pulled over saw the light. It went from being orangeish, to greenish, to coming close and being more silver. Another person with us says they thought it was white the hole time. It seemed as if it was following us for 45-50 miles, it would stay parallel to us the hole time, eathier following us, or very far away. ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome reports from the other witnesses.  We believe a twinkling star, perhaps Sirius, would be the first possibility to be ruled out.

A bright, silent,  white circular light hovered for about 20 minutes and then sped off and disappeared.;1997-03-17 20:00:00;20 minutes;A bright, silent,  white circular light hovered for about 20 minutes and then sped off and disappeared. Two of us were sitting on the back porch looking up at the crystal clear sky and observed a white circular bright light hovering at about 500 feet. It remained stationary for about 20 minutes. We went in and called the local airports and their response was: there are no reported aircraft in the area.;33.9047866666667;-112.842633333333
Three lights over central Arizona desert at work in the darkness.;2002-08-15 00:30:00;1/2 hour;Three lights over central Arizona desert at work in the darkness. I was traveling on Rte 60 west from Wickenburg AZ at 12:30 am on 8/15/02 on a clear, warm night.  After about 12 miles, I saw up ahead what looked like a small plane making touch and go' landings.  There were three lights and the craft made what seemed like approaches and barely touched the ground and then arose again into the sky.  It took a bit to realize that there is NOTHING out in the desert there no habitation and certainly no airport.  As I drew closer, the lights would change from a V formation into one single light, then into another formation or another alignment.  I saw that it would go over the road to the right (north) and then go very low to the ground, swing up and over the road again and hover on the south side then return in the same pattern.  I crossed the road after a sweep and looked out of my window and up about 500' to see the three lights havering at about l0:00 south.  The lights were very white and bright, narrow in focus and appeared to be in a southerly direction and there was no sound at all coming from it.  As I just passed it, the light nearest me started a slow turn in my direction and I kept on going, not frightened or threatened but nervous and with the purposeful message that they were working and I should keep on going.  I could not tell if it was one craft that morfed into shapes or if it was a configuration of three different lights.  My instinct says that there were three lights but I have no proof.  i continued on the road but stopped up ahead and the craft(s) continued to go in the same pattern and did so as I then drove off and watched in my rear view mirror.  I would approximate that there was a total of 8 or 9 passes that I observed during the + or - 1/2 hour that the event took place.  I cannot stress how desolate and uninhabitated the area in question is.  It is desert land and not an open range.;33.9047866666667;-112.842633333333

We were northeast of Wickenburg,Az about ten or twelve miles or so. I was the last one up sitting there in the chair enjoying the cool Arizona nights. When I noticed what appeared to be a star heading west to east at a very high rate of speed. at first I thought it was just a satalite (we see alot of them in Az) but I dont think I could of seen this one so close to the earth horizon. I thought it might be a Jet liner but there were no noise and no flashing lights. I watched it go across the horizon in about 3 minutes and then it vanished from view. I have reported two other sittings  on here about lights we have saw in the last 5 months. It is amazing what you can see if you just look. I would still like to know whats going on out there in the western part of Az? I think a lot of people were like me, they see these things but they never get reported.

My husband, 9yr. old daughter were in our truck heading to Las Vegas from Phoenix.  We were on highway 93, heading north just through W;2013-11-02 19:30:00;20 minutes;My husband, 9 yr. old daughter were in our truck heading to Las Vegas from Phoenix.  We were on highway 93, heading north just through Wickenburgh, Az, just past where the 60 turns into highway 93 (Around mile marker 171)  We saw a big single bright orangish/gold light in the sky - it caught our attention.   All of a sudden, off to the left hand side [11 o'clcok position in the horizon] - the one light horizontally multiplied into 3 and then 5 lights [very much reminiscent of the Phoenix Lights back in 1997 - but on a much smaller scale] and back to 1 and then ~ disappeared.  It happen again 30 seconds later off to the right-hand side [1 o'clock position of the horizon].  Again, the 1 multiplied into 2, then 3, then 5 lights - back to 1 and then disappeared. By this time my husband ((name deleted)), and I were really excited about what we saw so my 9 yr. old daughter, ((daughter's name deleted)), in the back seat was wanting to see it too.   At this moment we decided try to find a place to pull the car off to the side of the road, hoping to  capture it on video.  While she was also looking out the window it happened one more time off to the far left side of our vehicle, probably the 9 o'clock position on the horizon.  Unfortunately by the time we found a place to pull the truck over, the lights had vanished and didn't appear anymore.   However, we did see & hear two incredibly fast move military jets moving in tandem in the sky.  We knew they were military because of the rate of speed, and the unmistakable roar they make.  They tore through the sky directly above where the lights had been and continued on south out of our sight.   Then, it was over.  ((husband's name deleted)) and I looked for the next mile marker after we started down the road again and it was no. 190.  I am a nightly Coast to Coast listener so naturally I knew to notate all of these details so I could submit a report to you. It was our own personal Phoenix Lights incident which by the way we also saw back in 1997.  We were driving on the 202 Freeway at the time and observed the lights hanging in the sky. Anway, that's our story. Thank you, ((name deleted)) Phoenix, Az;33.9047866666667;-112.842633333333
