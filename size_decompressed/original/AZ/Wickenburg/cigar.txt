I'm a business owner and a private helicopter pilot and have flown and driven this particular rout several times over the past few years.  This was the first time to ever witness an encounter of this significance.  There is no doubt in my mind the lights/craft I describe below are extraterrestrial. While driving north bound on HWY 93 from Wickenburg, AZ towards Las Vegas, NV, on December 2, 2009, at approximately 8:45 p.m., an orange glow in the western sky caught my attention.  The lights seemed to be about five miles to my west and at an elevation of about 6000 to 8000 ft. AGL (above Ground Level).   At first there was only one object and with a blink of my eyes there were three more cigar shaped lights that glowed fire orange.  The lights were in a vertical step formation with the original one hovering off to the right of the other three.  Within about ten seconds they were gone. About 15 min. later as I continued N. Bound on HWY 93 the lights appeared at approximately the same elevation and distance from me as before except this time they were in a horizontal formation in the NNW direction of my location and had movement to the NNE direction, they moved like skipping rocks in a pond, quite amazing to see.   The night sky was extremely clear and the moon was bright.  This was an extraordinarily clear night and there was almost no traffic on the road.;33.9047866666667;-112.842633333333
