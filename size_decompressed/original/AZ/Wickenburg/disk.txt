It was orange and appeared to be sending beams of light to the ground or the tops of the mountains, i say this because we could almost see the light coming from the object. this was in the area of vulture mountain. this was just one of the many sightings i have had over the years in the same area ((NUFORC Note:  Date may approximate, and the witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

This is only one of the many sightings I have had in this same area over the years. On this trip I had probably 8 to ten different sightings ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  One of two reports submitted in rapid succession from witnesses to the same event.  PD));33.9047866666667;-112.842633333333
