Hello,   After returning home from a three day festival, feeding scraps to the mutts, I notice my shadow moving across the wall/ground.  I thought the light-pole behind me was falling over. Turned around looking for cars headlights and didnâ€™t see a car and the light pole was no near falling over. But behind from the light pole came a circle shape white neon bright light moving towards the north.  It felt like it was a very short distant above the light pole.  Weakling at the knees, shivering and no one to call out to see the light.  The light became very tine and disappeared. Found your site and thought about telling someone. I also seen five stars blow away an object that move into the middle of these five tine stars.  The Stars were located towards the west but in the air. Fyi.
