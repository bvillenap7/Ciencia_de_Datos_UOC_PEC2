2 perfectly aligned orbs silently cruise across Navajo Nation skies.;2009-11-25 17:55:00;7mins;2 perfectly aligned orbs silently cruise across Navajo Nation skies. On Nov. 25, 2009, at around 1755hrs I had witnessed two perfectly aligned lights gently cross the evening sky near my parents home in Chinle, Az(rural area). I immediately had my parents and kids come join in the viewing of these two lights. Oddly enough they were silently cruising with the leading light ahead of the tailing light with a distance of 100-200ft in between both. Being of past military experience I noticed no FAA required strobes blinking, no sounds were emitted and it kept in perfect alignment throughout the duration. The lead light was 5 times brighter than the tail which suggested  one craft and not two crafts. As stated, no noise of engine propulsion was heard(propellers or jet rumble), no contrails were visible and no flashing light beacons on or near the lights. The estimation of its altitude would be about 2500 to 3000 ft. This viewing lasted about 7 minutes until it lingered out of sight. Keep in mind that the overall light radiance was ! as it appeared, whole orbs. They approached from the northwest direction and departed in a southeastern direction. Seeing how it was dark in the eastern skies, I couldnâ€™t make a definite shape of this sighting but as I stress, the front and rear light alignment was perfectly straight.;36.1304;-109.6037
