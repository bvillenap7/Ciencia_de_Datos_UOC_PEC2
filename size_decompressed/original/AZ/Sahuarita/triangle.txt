Very large cone-shaped object appeared out of nowhere;1997-03-14 19:00:00;10 seconds;Very large cone-shaped object appeared out of nowhere My son,my wife,and I were out in our front yard at about 1900 hours.A very large UFO appeared out of nowhere about 2 miles away,over a small mountain range nearby which has a reputation for occasional UFO activity.The object was shaped like an elongated cone or possibly like a pyramid.The specific shape was somewhat hard to determine since the entire surface of the object was covered with a pulsating,yellowish-orange energy field of some sort.The base of the object was completely flat,with a width of approximately 200 feet.The object tapered to a completely pointed top.I would estimate the height of the object as being comparable to that of a 50 story building,if not taller.After it appeared,it hung motionless for about 10 seconds,then seemingly de-materialized into thin air.It emitted no audible sound.;31.9455;-110.9973
