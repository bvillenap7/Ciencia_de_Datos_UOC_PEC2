Random white flashes of light of differing intensity in the same small area of sky;2017-09-29 19:00:00;30 seconds;Random white flashes of light of differing intensity in the same small area of sky Saw the exact same lights high in the sky that I reported on the 9/21/2017, in the same small area of sky.  Random white flashes of light of differing intensity in a small patch of sky.  The lights did not proceed across the sky as an aircraft would but stayed in the same small circular patch of sky.  The moon is too bright tonight to see if the location is the exact same place as I saw them before in relation to the Milky Way, but I'm sure it's close.  The event only lasted a few seconds this time. Immediately after I saw the lights, I saw the tiny, faint light of a satellite move across the same area of sky and immediately after the satellite, I saw a shooting star go across the sky from north to south.   The strange lights are much brighter in intensity than the satellite but I get the impression that they are very high in altitude, much higher than an aircraft would be but I'm not sure if they are out in space or still in the atmosphere.;31.9455;-110.9973
