Both objects were a sphere in shape that looked like a bright star.  The star moved in a deliberate path towards the southeast, from the west.  Despite the SE motion, the object seemed to effortlessly move/shimmy from left to right.  There was no red light associated with the bright white there was no jet noise.  The first object faded out after traveling SE for approximately 2 min. After the first object, an F-16 came from the same spot where the first object was originally spotted from the direction of the copper mine.  A visible white and red light was accompanied by jet noise. Shortly after the jet flew east, another object like the first appeared in the same spot in the west, in the direction of the copper mine.  The object was just as bright as the first but the light dissipated approx 5-8 sec, after traveling in a NE direction.  Approximately 3-5 min after the light disapated, two F-16s appeared where the objects originated from the west.  This time the jets were traveling significantly faster towards the east.;31.9455;-110.9973
