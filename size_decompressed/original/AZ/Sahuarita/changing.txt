I saw with the naked eye lights in the sky on what someone would say in an oval craft.  They were lighting on and off around the craft.  Now and then something distended from the craft.  I took many pictures. On the pictures there are three distinct shapes that look equally apart in terms of distance. First the orange tubular orange shape.  It got long, short, bright.  Whatever is inside was spinning as seen on video. Second is a dark gray shape.  You must enlarge to even see it.  The inside of this shape was spinning. The third shape started as two white circles.  Then in the middle and even brighter bite line displayed.  The circles turned into a comma shape and was blue, white, yellow. I was looking out a side front window. Lasted for an hour. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We are awaiting copies of photos she took of the object.  PD));31.9455;-110.9973
