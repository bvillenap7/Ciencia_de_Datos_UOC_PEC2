Multiple lights on one craft in Sahuarita, AZ.;2018-01-30 18:30:00;~30 seconds;Multiple lights on one craft in Sahuarita AZ Driving down a road, I turned towards the driver of the car to say something as I was in the passenger seat.  I jokingly said that tonight is a perfect night to see a ufo, the driver didnâ€™t believe in ufos.   As I turned back to look out the window we saw a white light in the sky, we thought it was a plane.  I made another snark comment and as I was saying this, more lights showed up next to the original light, it stayed in place.  There was one light on either side of the original light and both lights were blinking but not the middle light.  I asked the driver and the person in the backseat if they saw what I was seeing.  They said yes and stopped the car.  All of a sudden, more lights showed up and they stopped blinking.  You could see the outline of the craft, a circular shape but it blended in with the evening sky, it was almost invisible as you could say but the lights (about 8 of them) and the outline was all you could see.  It all happened so fast too, as soon ! as it was there it was gone and now the skeptics that were in the car now believe.  I wish I could see it again it was amazing!
