I witnessed at least 15 flashing lights over a desert area, East of Sahuarita Arizona. Most of which moved North, about 2 or 3 went South. All were moving very fast across the horizon. One other person witnessed the event aside me. The lights were completely random, I could see an airplane in the distance. I know it was an airplane due to its slow speed and contant red light. This is how I concluded that these crafts were not man made.( for all I know ) After a few second, all the crafts were out of sight, except for the airplane. The lights flashed randomly, it apperaed to be circular objects but I could not tell because of the darkness. All I could see is the strange white lights.;31.9455;-110.9973
