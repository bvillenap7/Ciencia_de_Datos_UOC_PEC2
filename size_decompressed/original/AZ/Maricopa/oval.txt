orangest white lights in a slow moving circular pattern seem over Maricopa, Az.;2010-09-08 23:00:00;20 mins;orangest white lights in a slow moving circular pattern seem over Maricopa, Az. Last night while driving home on Queen Creek Rd. I saw a circular row of orangest white lights about 6 miles away the lights were moving slow and as one light would disapear another would apear. While this was going on I was on the phone with my boyfriend. He ran outside trying to see the lights, but couldn't from where he was at.  The lights only lasted for about 30 seconds, but left me with chills and almost in tears.  As I got into Maricopa city the lights appeared again about 2 miles away now they had the same affect one dissapearing as another appearing lasting on seconds just like the last, but heading the opposite direction now. Still on the phone I had my boyfriend look for the lights once again, but he still could not see them.  As I arrived home he was standing in front of the driveway waiting for me while pulling into the drive way he yelled at me to hurry and get out he was standing looking right toward the west at lights with the same color same ef! fect about two miles away, I got out and we continued to watch these lights for a couple more seconds which then dissapeared and never came back as we know of. I believe what we saw was a ufo I never have seen anything like it in my life, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has seen something like this to. My name is Chelsie Lewis I'm 20 year old college student from Maricopa, Az.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
Red glowing disc wart like in appearance around tree top level.;2014-02-09 20:32:00;2 minutes;Red glowing disc wart like in appearance around tree top level My mother was outside smoking around 8:30PM when she observed a red glowing light around tree top level moving south at around 20 miles per hour.   She yelled for me to come outside and look at it.  I came outside and saw what she was pointing at and started filming it on my iphone camera.  It had a red glow to it as I caught the remaining 20 seconds before it left our field of view.   My mother who saw around 2 minutes of it said to her when it was at the mid point of her viewing area that she could see a disk like outline and that it had about 5-6 protrusion type areas.   She described it as wart-like looking, as the best description she could come up with.   I sent my brother my iphone video of what I caught and he pulled some still pictures from it after zooming in on the object.   It was traveling from North to South and maybe 100 feet above treetop level.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
