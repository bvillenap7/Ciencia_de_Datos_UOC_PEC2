8-10 bright stationary orange lights, plus a small line of 6-8 smaller  bluish-white lights which flashed in succession from l. to r., ;1997-03-16 21:00:00;4-5 min.;Summary : 8-10 bright stationary orange lights, plus a small line of 6-8 smaller  bluish-white lights which flashed in succession from l. to r., moved off rapidly to the west, disappeared, reappeared, and repeated event 3 times. While traveling south on Maricopa road 2 women, one a Sales Manager and the other a Director of Sales for a large telecommunications firm witnessed a group of 8-10 bright orange stationary lights in the sky just above a line of mountains to the SW of the town of Maricopa, AZ.  In the midst of these lights a small line of 6-8 bluish-white smaller lights suddenly appeared the lights flashed in sequence from left to right 3 times, then suddenly moved very quickly off to the West and disappeared.  Approximately 30-45 seconds later, the bluish-white lights reappeared in approximately the same position as the first time and repeated the flashing and movement then reappeared just to the west of te original location repeated this once more.  About 30 seconds after the last repeat, the orange lights simply disappeared.  The orange lights appeared very similar to the sightings on Sept. 13 in the area around Phoenix, but we have heard no one mention the bluish-white lights which we s! aw.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
Amber/Orange Lights;2003-01-22 21:30:00;15 minutes;Amber/Orange Lights I walked outside to my backyard patio.  Partially clear night, wispy high clouds in some places.  Immediately was staring at two very huge, bright amber/orange lights.  They were to the southwest of my house, probably five miles away.  They were very low on the horizon.  Possibly as low as 3000 feet.  They were stable, did not move in any direction, did not fade, did not blink.  I stared at them for over 10 minutes to confirm this.  Off in the distance from Luke AF base or Phoenix National Guard came four helicopters or planes (I couldn't tell which)very fast.  Just as they arrived close to the two amber/orange lights, they both disappeared, as if someone turned off a switch.  The military aircraft circled for awhile, then flew off after 3 or 4 minutes. ((FOLLOW-UP FROM WITNESS)) Thank you for replying to my report. I hope it's not too late, but unfortunately I need to retract this report.  Apparently it is some kind of flare or something similar.  I do not know this for sure, but the next two night in a row, after I made the report, I saw the same thing again in the same place....only 1 light each successive night, not two.  But I also heard a loud bang...like heavy artillery gun.  I think it is being launched from the ground. Sorry about the erroneous report....but it's better to fess up than feel guilty!!

watched lights for 20 minutes in the desert.;2004-03-23 21:00:00;20 min;watched lights for 20 minutes in the desert. Myself and two other friends were Varmit calling the night of march 23 in the Hasiampa river bottom west of Surprise,Az. we had taken Sun Valley parkway around the whwhite tank mountains (west) then into the dry river bottom. we like to call at night from the back of a pick up to locate any locations of preadtors then come back the next day and hunt there. We had headed south and had made 3 stops to call some 15 minutes each time. I have been around and in this wash all of my life, I ride my quads with my family in it 20 or so times a year. I know every bend and every part of that area. On the 4 stop while still moving south slowly I saw thur the tree's 2 light that appeared in the sky just ahead of us. They weren't there a few minutes ago but they were there now! Eric stopped the truck and we all got out and watched the lights. that were perfectly still bright yellow orangish color and very big. I know this area there is nothing out here except a few high line wires but these light were much too high to be the lines and I know they dont have lights on them anyway. I climbed up onto the truck and looked at the with a rifle scope and couldn't see anything except lights. I am a Vietnam veteran and I know chopper lights and chopper sounds.these were NOT choppers. I have shot flares off hundreds of flares in Vietnam. Flares swing down and leave a smoke trail.These lights were NOT flares. As I stood on the truck I could see the ground was lit up under them I couldn't see any lights from them but the ground was Illumated anyway. I estimate we were at least 1/2 mile from thse lights maybe more its had to tell at night. the boys got real scared and wanted to leave so we started the truck and headed back the way we came. as we were traveling north up the wash Eric the driver saw these two light go out! we stopped and looked again then they came back on. As we watch them again I now saw another light to the west of them across the wash several miles away. Then the lights went off again. We headed ! north again stopping at a fence gate as I got out the lights had came back on for the third time and were in the same place. We left the wash and headed east toward sun valley parkway watching these lights all the way. As we approached the highway we stopped and looked thur the scope again to see if we could tell what this was.We could see very clearly the light of the Palo Verde power plant to the west of the lights. I tried to pin point where their location was and the best estimate I have is east of the power plant and west of White tank mountains. I dont have any other explanation other than this was a UFO..I have elmiated all possible causes in my mind.Planes,choppers and flares. as we drove north we saw these lights untill the road went around the mountain and we couldn't see them any longer. I wish I could have talked these scared boys into going south on the highway to get closer but they were just to shook up to go.  this must of been a UFO!! I have who friend asked me to put this on here. It is very interesting there was another report about these lights on the same date and almost the same time.

blinking lights above Table Top mountain...;2004-08-09 22:30:00;5-10 minutes;blinking lights above Table Top mountain... I live in the desert SW of Maricopa and have lived here for the past 26 years.  I am very familiar with the fact that to our west is the Gila Bend Gunnery Range and that often at night they launch flares that are suspended in the air for about 3-5 minutes, at different elevations.  They burn a golden glow until they burn out then just seem to disappear.  What I saw was not this.  What I viewed was due south.  I have seen it twice now, the first time was about a month ago.  Both times it was above Table Top mountain, which is about 4200 feet tall.  I would first see one light, then very quickly would see 2 or 3 others light up, then they would blink on and off.  At one point their were 7 lights. The lights were very stable and did not move, they just blinked on and off. They did not stay lit like the gunnery lights,(gunnery lights flare when they light up, stay a consistant brightness, then totally burn out...they don't keep lighting up over and over, again.) These lights  would go on and off, almost in some kind of a sequence.  Both times I watched the lights for the total time they were dancing about.  Then they would just stop.  Tonight I stood outside and just kept watching.  About 10 minutes later the lights all blinked one more time and then there was nothing.  In the direction I was facing, due south, I really don't believe there is anything there that can be doing this.  I drove out that way, the last time,  to see if maybe there was a tower put up on the mountain or something (this is a very rural area) and there is nothing.  I don't have a clue what I saw.  I just know that for where the lights were...there is nothing there that would make those lights.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
4-5 amber orbs seen over Sonoran Desert, south on 347;2006-04-20 19:43:00;10 seconds ea;4-5 amber orbs seen over Sonoran Desert, south on 347 04/20/06  7:43 PM :  Heading South down 347 from Chandler, past Riggs Road, down towards the Ak-Chin Indian Reservation, spotted 4 (or 5) large, stationary equidistant amber orbs in a zigzag pattern.  They were almost directly over the road (or, if further out than they appeared, over the Sonoran Desert Natl. Monument), though how far in the distance and at what altitude I don’t know.  Twilight had almost completely faded.  They were not there more than ten seconds before all the orbs disappeared at the exact same time as though someone had quickly turned down a dimmer switch to ‘off’. Less than ten minutes later another set of lights - same color but elongated in shape and more tightly grouped/farther off - appeared in succession to the Southwest of 347 and quickly disappeared in the same order.  Each would come on and soon fade out as its neighbor within the cluster followed suite.  We followed 347 and then 84 west to the I8 and headed South then East, seeing them further away to the SW yet again on two more occasions for no more than 6 seconds at a time, probably over the Barry M. Goldwater Range at this point.  We turned south down Stanfield Rd., eventually heading into Tohono Indian Reservation (and seeing another quick, stationary-yet fade-in/fade-out series of amber lights directly in front of us, to the south) before turning around.  As we headed back north, the series appeared again (around 8:30pm), this time to our South West, perhaps back over the Goldwater Range.  These were even further out, and as they faded, they seemed to become flickering white lights, far in the distance, apparently unmoving, coming and going from sight.  We had stopped the car, and could hear no jet noises at all, close or in the distance, and the air was calm.  When nothing more happened we headed back North to the 8 and East to the I10 for Phoenix. While the last sets of flicking white lights may or may not have been flares, I cannot be certain either way, as they were so far off.  However the first set of equidistant orbs were like nothing I have ever seen in the sky before, and the succeeding groups were almost equally large and strange, instantly striking my wife and I each time as odd. Twice, 20 minutes apart, we saw what appeared to be shootings stars cross through the general vicinity of where the lights had just been.  In any case, the events were fascinating, strange, and unmistakably ‘different.’;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
Stationary Orange Lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible military flares??  PD));2006-12-21 20:18:00;10 minutes;Stationary Orange Lights Saw two bright lights - pulsing orangish/red.  They were stationary in the sky, no smoke trails.  Then a third light appeard about 5 minutes later, making a traingular pattern.  Shortly after that, a fourth light appeared equidistant from the first two lights.  Then the third light split into two more lights, making a total of 5 lights.  The two lights that split came back to one, and the fourth light disappeared.  The three remaining lights all remained stationary and ever initially seeing the lights at 8:18pm, they disappeared at 8:28pm.  The lights were very similar to what I observed on 12/6, except instead of being southwest of Maricopa, AZ, the lights were over the Gila River Indian Reservation, inbetween the Estrella mountains and Tablerock Mesa.

Two amber colored orbs - Maricopa, AZ;2007-06-20 22:00:00;25 minutes;Two amber colored orbs - Maricopa, AZ My wife and I were driving in separate cars and both saw the same thing.  There were two amber colored lights close to each other and close to the ground (200 feet above the ground).  They were several miles away, but there was a clear view across the desert.  They remained motionless for 25 minutes.  I pulled off the highway and took a couple pictures on my cell phone.  While I was pulled off the road and out of my car, I saw several military flares being dropped above the lights - they were smaller in size, not as bright, and faded out in 5-10 seconds.  The orbs didn't move while the flares were dropped.  After a total of 25 minutes, the lights disappeared.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
Bright light in the skies south of Maricopa, AZ increases luminosity before additional lights spawn and streak away.;2010-09-01 21:45:00;less than 1 min;Bright light in the skies south of Maricopa, AZ increases luminosity before additional lights spawn and streak away. Driving home southbound on Ralston Rd- a large, very bright yellow/orange light in the southern sky caught my attention. Knowing the sky after living out here for a few years, I quickly made the mental note that it wasn’t a star. As I looked at the light it increased in luminosity rapidly. This increase took place very quickly- I would say within 5 seconds and made the light/object appear to increase in size dramatically. Additional lights then blinked on in quick succession- first one to the east, then one to the west, and another even further west. The additional lights came on at a luminosity that matched the first light. They were evenly spaced, making me wonder if they were separate or part of one large object. All the lights rose simultaneously- moving upward and southward at great speed, disappearing from sight. I have seen numerous things in the night sky out here- this is the first that I cannot come up with an explanation for. I am used to seeing flares over the hills to the west of my home, and I am familiar with both military and commercial air traffic that frequents our skies. The size and brightness of the light I saw was well in excess of the luminosity of the stars and planets in the sky. The increase in brightness is highly irregular in the sky. The additional lights and the first all rose in unison against gravity and did not streak across the sky in the same way as satellites or meteors I have seen.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
As many as 5 large, bright orange lights seen hovering near Ak-Chin Casino south of Maricopa, Arizona.;2013-01-14 20:00:00;30:00;As many as 5 large, bright orange lights seen hovering near Ak-Chin Casino south of Maricopa, Arizona. When I walked outside to join my girlfriend  on our back porch at approximately 8pm local time tonight, Monday January 14, 2013, she said, I just saw a bunch of orange lights, hovering out by the casino.   I replied, Yeah, sure you did.   I sat with her, lit a cigarette and about a minute or two later, they appeared again. At first, two lights appeared almost simultaneously, followed by two more lights a minute later and a fifth not long after.  The lights were a deep orange, a color I don’t ever recall seeing on an aircraft, and the size of the lights was much greater than that I have ever seen on any aircraft, as well. The moon was clearly visible, as were many stars on this clear evening, and while they were much smaller than any moon I have ever seen, they were also much larger than any star I have ever seen. We spend a LOT of time on our back porch and see aircraft every day, both during the day and at night.  Having been stationed at NAS Fallon, NV for 3 years, I’ve seen many aircraft, and these lights appeared and behaved like no aircraft I have ever seen before. From the time I first saw them, there were from one to five lights at between 180 and 200 degrees from our location, and in my opinion they were no more than two or three thousand feet above ground level. Angle of elevation was very slight, maybe 15 or 20 degrees at most. The lights were almost stationary, but comparing their positions with fixed objects on the ground, they WERE moving very slowly.  They never appeared to change elevation during the 20-30 minutes in which they were visible.  Having spent two years aboard USS OAK HILL as a part of the Navigation/Administration department, I spent many hours on the bridge wings, taking bearings of fixed objects ashore to triangulate our position, and there are many lights on the ground in the direction these lights were, making it easy to determine if they were moving.  They WERE moving, but hardly at all. The light were generally moving from right to left looking almost due south, BUT while the lights often appeared as pairs, these pairs were constantly moving in relation to one another. At one point, two of the lights appeared to merge, and then separate as if one was moving slightly faster than the other. According to Flight Service Station Phoenix, winds were either northerly or northeasterly, but it was stated that this was for elevations between 3,000 and 34,000 feet and these lights were lower than that, in my estimation. About 5 minutes after alerting our next-door neighbors, the lights disappeared and did not return.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294

Two orange balls of light from Phoenix Area.;2013-12-25 19:15:00;5 minutes;Two orange balls of light from Phoenix Area On Christmas night about 7:15 PM, my brother was outside at my mother house talking to my sister on the phone while smoking when he turned to the North and saw an orange light coming in a south direction.  He hollered into the house where the rest of us were and told us to come look at this weird orange light.  Myself, my mother, my 14 year old son, my older brother, all came outside to see what he was talking about.  He pointed up at the night sky and we all saw this orange light moving across the sky in a southern direction almost overhead of the house.  We watched it move by for several minutes. It appeared to be maybe 1,500 feet or so in altitude.  When it got to about 30 degrees off the horizon it just started fading out and then disappeared  My son just got a gopro camera for Christmas so he was filing it with that.  My mother filmed it with her digital video camera.  I took some shots with my Iphone.  After it went out about 5 min later we saw a second orange light coming from the North from Phoenix heading due south but it had a red appearance in the front but by the time it came over us it was also completely orange.  You couldn't make out a shape other then it was a round orange ball of light.  It was also at about 1,500-2,000 feet and traveled slowly and went out at about the same location as the first one.  My mother who was filming it on her video camera and zooming in on it said after it went out she could see it turn sharply to the right and disappear.  We have video and still shots of the orange lights.  We discussed whether these were just Chinese lanterns we saw but since we have seen those before none of us felt they were.  It was a clear night and there was no wind at ground level.  I base the altitude based on my Cessna flying experience in this area.  The objects took about 5 minutes to transverse the sky from our initial sighting  until it went out and was no longer visible.  It went over the Villages at Rancho El Dorado subdivison in Maricopa, AZ Pinal County.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294

I noticed a very bright orange light in the sky as I walked in to my back yard, after I threw my garbage away, I came back to my porch to see the light was still there and decided to get a better view by standing on my trampoline.  I started to record the object as it seemed interesting and especially since I saw the same thing that a MUFON investigator filmed as well only to show that it was flares. This behaved like what I would consider a flare.  Basically it was a bright orange light that flickered and intensified at times.  It did not move at all and would occasionally go dark then come back on. There were two other objects in the sky that I also filmed that were not as bright but did the same thing of flickering and turning off then back on. At one point the bright object appeared as three discrete light sources then back to one. At another point, one of the smaller lights appeared as two independently flickering lights.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
