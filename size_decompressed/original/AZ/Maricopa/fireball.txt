On Wednesday December 28, 2011 at 9:30 PM, I was traveling along Parker Road West in Maricopa, Arizona. I noticed some objects in the air.  They were too far away to get a good view.  I then turned North onto Casa Grande /Maricopa Road.  I was heading up to a Circle K Gas Station to get some gas.  I still saw the objects in the air but still at a distance. I then turned into the Gas Station and the objects became closer. This Gas Station is located on John Wayne  Boulevard.  I saw the objects quite clearly.  There were 3 objects.  They were moving, two were coming at each other and were moving around.  There were 3 flying objects. They glowed like a red fire  glow.  The disc was red with Yellow in the middle band and red again on the outside. of object and Red in the center.  One object circled another and one stayed still. I have never seen anything this fast before.  They acted like they were watching us. I had a cashier from the Station with me and she got scared and went back into the store.  Another man was there he got totally freaked out and left the store.  I talked to a police officer, he was mad because he had missed this event as he always looks for these things on his patrol. He is the person that gave me your contact number.  I watched this from 9:30 to 10:15.  Two had flown away and one stayed there and started moving toward Phoenix.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
