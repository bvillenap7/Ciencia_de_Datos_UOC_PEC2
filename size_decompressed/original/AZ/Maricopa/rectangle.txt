Multi light formation high in the sky;2016-02-19 06:30:00;10 minutes;Multi light formation high in the sky Friday Feb 19, 2016, approx 6:30 PM to 7: PM  The evening of Feb. 19, 2016, my husband and I were traveling on hwy 347 to Maricopa, Az…….about 8 miles out of Maricopa, my husband pointed in the sky and told me to look in the southwesterly direction.   In my view was  two large clusters of whitish/yellowish light……they appeared to be in a formation of several rows of lights…….I watched this for approx. 5 minutes, then the cluster on the right  disappeared, it did not fade away, it just went out…….within seconds a streak of light appeared higher and more to the south,  this streak was a solid formation and appeared to have a pinkish color  and stayed there but began to fade quickly……..the larger of the clusters  was still in the sky and we continued to watch for another 5 minutes then it disappeared as the first cluster….did not fade, just went out.  I would approximate the altitude of the clusters was 2–3 thousand feet, if brought down and laid on the ground the size was 5 or 6 miles across and 3–4 miles high,  I saw ! nothing fall from the sky…….the clusters did not move……the light seemed to twinkle a bit but there was not a glowing affect.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
