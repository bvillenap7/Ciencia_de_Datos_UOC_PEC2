Oct, 1975 Objects first appeared as bright orange lights like flares dropped from parachutes in formation.  We knew they weren't flares when two objects on opposite sides of the formation simultaneously rose several hundred feet above the other two center objects.  The strangeness continued when the intense orange light disappeared from each and was replaced by three white circular lights in a triangle. They seemed to emit smoke but it was likely from super heating of the air around the lights in the cool night. The objects drifted out into the flats and landed about 1/4 mile away right in the backyard of a local ranch house in the desert lighting up the whole place. My girlfriend started running into the desert at the objects but we caught her and all walked to a better vantage point(a few weeks or months after our sighting T.Walton ran up on one too - bad idea).  We watched the objects on the ground and one of them kept going up and down, six - ten feet into the air.  Reminded me of the dance of the bees... The objects were smaller than the house, perhaps 20 feet in diameter.  The lights went dark after a time and we never saw them leave.  About a week or two later one of the witnesses and myself walked up around the hill where the objects were first seen and found a mutilated steer that had not been touched by coyotes or buzzards which were very numerous in the area.  At the time we had never heard of cattle mutilations and did not seriously connect the two events. We were never able to approach the ranch house to ask what the hell went on that night as they had very big dog that chased us away whenever we ventured too near.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
3 lights. Would change colors then circle each other then go on and off in a line. This went on for over 45 min;2004-12-13 21:10:00;45 Min;3 lights. Would change colors then circle each other then go on and off in a line. This went on for over 45 min There were 3 lights on the horizon at first. Then they disapeared  and when they came back there were two doing circles around each other. Then they would go up in a straight line flasing on and off. They would change colors from orange to red.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
Orange Light breaks into evenly spaced pieces then disappears in Arizona;2014-10-23 19:30:00;20 minutes;Orange Light breaks into evenly spaced pieces then disappears in Arizona Saw a bright orange light to the southwest of Phoenix on the way to Maricopa.  Thought it might be a plane flying low and away from Sky Harbor.  Kept watching and suddenly it broke into about 5 evenly spaced pieces and then dissapeared! My husband was driving, and our 10 year old niece was watching it from the back seat. My husband and I work for a ministry and live in Maricopa.  We were really shocked when it broke into pieces and then dissapeared.  They did not fall to the ground.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
