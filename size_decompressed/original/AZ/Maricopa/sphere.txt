Red flying globes;2012-05-23 19:55:00;1 min;Red flying globes City of Maricopa, AZ  At approximately 7:55 PM of May 23rd 2012, local Arizona time, driving back home from the local Wal-Mart,  I noticed 2 flying red balls/globes flying 100 to 150 feet above my residential subdivision of Glenn Wylde just 1 block away from my residence .  As I noticed the 2 flying globes, I pulled over immediately, got out of my car and observed this event in more detail. The flying red globes made a 90 degree turn from southeast heading to a northeast at approximately 25 to 30 miles per hour flight speed at a complete silence. They were probably as big as a large car and I noticed that their flight was at a controlled manner due to the fact that the second globe was following the first with the same distance all the time. I witnessed this event for approximately 30 to 45 seconds.  I snapped a picture of one of the flying globes with my phone’s camera. After that I got back in my car and drove about 100 feet around the corner to get to my residence’s street when I noticed another red flying globe, but this time they were 3 red flying balls/globes with the same path as the other 2, heading northeast, approximately 100 to 150 feet above the ground at the same speed as the other earlier 2 red globes, same size at a complete silence like the other 2. I pulled over immediately, got out of my car and recorded a video of the event.  I then drove to my residence and pulled in my driveway. I proceeded to my house to tell my wife what I have witnessed and recorded,  then I proceeded back out front to get the groceries out of my car and I noticed another flying red globe, same size, flying slowly 100 to 150 feet above ground and  heading  the same northeast path  as the previous 5 red globes. I rushed into my house to tell my wife and we ran through my house to get to my backyard. We got outside and both of us witnessed this red flyi! ng globe at a very slow control flight over my backyard heading the same direction as the previous 5.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
Two Orange orbs seen laterally moving near Maricopa Arizona then suddenly disappearing.;2013-03-11 18:00:00;10 minutes;Two Orange orbs seen laterally moving near Maricopa Arizona then suddenly disappearing. Two bright orange orbs seen appearing suddenly South East above Maricopa AZ. The two orange orbs seemed to move laterally several hundred feet towards a  peculiar contrail a jet had left 15 minutes earlier, then after these two orange orb lit objects approached the contrail approx. 10,000 ft in height they suddenly and completely disappeared. I was an aircraft technician not only in the military but in the private sector for many years, and I am extremely familiar with aircraft lighting, bulb types, wing markers, belly markers and tail markers, these orange orbs did not have characteristics of any  aircraft lighting I have ever seen before. From any make of aircraft. These similar orange anomalies are seen in the Maricopa area quite frequently but not with such lateral movement as described in this report. The majority of  sightings are near the Palo Verde mountain range just west of the city of Maricopa, however what caught my eye about these anomalies is that they were east by southeast of Maricopa this time, and moving laterally until they disappeared instantly. I have video evidence of the incident to coincide with this report. This is the second report Ive filed about this sighting, however the first seems to be not on your site, so I am making another report.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
8 Orange Lights moving into Storm clouds and lightning clouds in succession.;2013-07-06 20:35:00;10 minutes;8 Orange Lights moving into Storm clouds and lightning clouds in succession. 8 Bright Orange spheres moving in sky towards Lightning Storm clouds near Maricopa/Casa Grande, all appeared on horizon, moving south East into storm clouds where they disappeared within the clouds.  All the orange lights appeared spherical, and moved into clouds one after the other on same flight path.  Five witnesses in Maricopa.  These lights seem to be a weekly occurrence near Maricopa Arizona....  Can count on seeing these orange lights nearly every week.     I am a trained and seasoned aircraft technician both military and civilian experience..... These do not maintain normal aviation lighting characteristics, nor do they have similar lighting characteristics used in Military or aircraft.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294

2 bright pulsating stars and three orange orbs.;2014-01-17 06:45:00;30 minutes;2 bright pulsating stars and three orange orbs I don't know if this classifies as one sighting or multiple sightings so I will enter everything in this report.  On today's date Jan 17, 2014.  I left with my son to drop him off at his high school at 6:50AM Arizona time.  We live in a small town about 20 miles south of Phoenix.  As I was heading east on my street I noticed what appeared to be an extremely bright and larger then normal star at about 30 degrees off my horizon.  It appeared to be pulsating. I take my son each morning to school at this time so it was different from what I normally see.  The sun was still about 30 minutes from rising so still dark out.  As I was driving on highway 347 going south to his school I noticed a second really bright large star to the east. It appeared to be about 30 degrees off the horizon as well.  I could see both bright stars.   The one I saw earlier was at a bearing of about 45 degrees and looked like it was towards the superstition mountains which as the crow flies would be about 40 miles from me.  The other bright star light was about at a bearing of 105 degrees.  I dropped my son off at the back of his school by the gym which is the west side of the school and went out to the street that run east.  I know longer saw the second bright star that was at a bearing of 105 degrees but I could still see the first star that was at a bearing of 45 degrees.  It was still pulsating between bright and slightly less bright.  As I am sitting about 5 cars back at the light on W. Honeycutt Ave. and highway 347 by his school facing due east watching this star it suddenly got really bright for about a second then it just completely disappeared.  This was at about 7:11 AM according to my Jeep clock.  I was searching the skies to see if it had moved and when I was looking at the area where the second star had been to see if it might have come back instead I saw what appeared to be three orange orbs at about the same bearing 105 degrees where the bright star light was a! few minutes earlier.  Two were at about the same height of aro! und 20 d egrees off the horizon and one was about 2 degrees lower.  At this point I wanted to try and get a picture of them so I drove to an open farmers field about a mile south of where I was and parked by a school bus whose driver was waiting I suppose to start his middle school run.  I was on the eastside of highway 347 on the southside of Ferrel road looking at the three orange orbs that appeared to be 15-20 miles away at a bearing of 105 degrees.  I took about four pictures with my iphone but the distance was too far away for me to see them on my phone.  The orbs appeared to me slowly going south as I was using a telephone pole i the distance to see it was moving towards it.  This was about 7:13am Arizona time.  I don't know if the school bus driver saw the orange orbs as he was facing due east on the side of the road but he left after a few minutes.  As far as distance from me to the orange orbs I am guessing about 15 miles as it appeared to be somewhere by the city of Casa Grande an! d maybe the I-10 area.  It seems like highway 84 going east to Casa Grande would have taken you right into the orbs from my perspective.  After the last orb went out about 10 seconds later in the same area I saw a dark colored plane.  I couldn't tell what type it was and assume it was a plane.  It flew about as slow as a Cessna in a southern direction and then just disappeared after about 10 seconds. I don't know if that was just due to changing direction and angle thus not being able to see it anymore or if it actually just disappeared.  Was very strange.I know from now on when I take my son to school I am going to make sure I have my hand held video camera with me as then I could have zoomed in on the objects.  I am listing myself as the only witness but my son saw both stars as well as we commented on how bright they were compared to normal.  He did not see the orange orbs.  I am going to send the pictures I took on my iphone to my brother as he might be able to enhance the pictures better to see if you can see anything.  I couldn't see the! orbs on them due to dusk was occurring at the time of the orbs so they were right in the middle of dusk and a great distance away.  I haven't looked at the video I took yet as I have to download it from my phone.  If anything is worth posting I will make an additional report and add it.  Thanks.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
