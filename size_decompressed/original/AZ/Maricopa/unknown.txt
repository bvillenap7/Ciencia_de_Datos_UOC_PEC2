17 stationary and slow moving starlike objects emitting brilliant rainbow lights;2003-08-30 23:30:00;2 hours;17 stationary and slow moving starlike objects emitting brilliant rainbow lights Rainbow lights:  Observed what looked like 17 peculiar stars flickering more brightly than usual at irregular intervals.  Viewed through binoculars these objects were emitting brilliant flashing rainbow lights -- predominantly red, blue, green and gold. Other stars viewed through the binoculars did not take on this appearance.  The majority of these 17 objects remained stationary.  Most of them were in the southwestern quarter of the sky near or over the Barry Goldwater military range.  A few were observed in the northwest and northern quarters.  A few were observed in north-northeastern quarter.  A few were viewed in the southern quarter.  None were observed directly overhead and all at distances too great to discern shape of object.  I only saw the lights which were only visible with the binoculars, not the naked eye, so they appeared to be very far away.  Three were observed to be moving very gradually:  one in the north moved northwest to northeast in the direction of Phoenix.  Then a pair in the south moved closer to one another as did a pair in the northwest.  Several of them formed triangles at the points of the compass.  Two finally disappeared out of visual range or below the horizon.  At one point, one in the south changed from flashing rainbow colors to brilliant purple-blue light.  I did not observe any other unusual activity in the skies.  Some aircraft flew by during these hours, yet I was completely able to identify them as conventional aircraft due to the wing lights and rapid consistent movement.  None of the rainbow objects moved that fast.  Most of these objects were still hovering in the sky at the time I went inside to go to bed which was about 1:30 a.m.  My background is in the legal profession.  My partner witness has a background in semiconductor engineering.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
Maricopa, Az  Bright red light hovering and moving slowly over SW AZ for about 25min.;2008-07-03 21:15:00;25 to 30 min;Maricopa, Az  Bright red light hovering and moving slowly over SW AZ for about 25min. On July 3, 2008 at 2115 hrs myself and another person were witching fire works from a show about 5 miles S/SW of our location, when we spotted a what at first we thought to be a slow and low flying airplane or helicopter off of our 12 o’clock.  I had mentioned several times how slow the airplane was moving and if it was ever going to get towards our location.  We then moved to our S/SW to see the fire works from another position when we both noticed the craft slowly moving to the S/SW and gaining altitude it was a very bright red and it appeared to change colors to a white and back to red, it hovered for about another 15min or so and then was gone.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
Lights Over City Of Maricopa Previously Spotted;2008-11-20 22:00:00;20 min;Lights Over City Of Maricopa Previously Spotted Apparent common occurrence of object with two separate lights on opposite ends of the very large vehicle. No flashing beacons or white lights were present and no distinction of the vehicle could be identified. I have witnessed these very same lights in previous weeks and never could follow them long til they never lit up again and disappear. Vehicle moves from East to West at the same attitude flying low over residential area, rural area, and dairy farms. The lights appear to flash in a sequence one side slowly energizes and lights up then as it gets its brightest the other side starts to light up as the first side darkens lights last for roughly 2 seconds. Vehicle covers great distances in seconds, after I think its gone and I can't spot it anymore it reappears on the other side of town only to flash its lights again and disappear. Lights resemble the yellow orange glow of afterburners.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
One huge UFO or three seperate ones;2010-01-01 00:00:00;3 minutes;one huge UFO or three seperate ones On or about January first of 2010 I was out after midnight on my ranch in Maricopa Arizona to get something from my truck.  As I looked to my left which is West in a saddle of these small mountains about a one mile and a half away I see these very bright lights.  As I watched them there was no noise at all and it was very quiet out that night.  These lights were in a pattern of three like a triangle. There were three separate UFO’s all in a straight row for a total of nine lights.  They were moving very slow over the saddle of the mountain.  My first thought was man that is some big mining equipment being moved at night.  But then I realized there was no sound which you would hear because it was that close.  The lights were very bright I mean like football stadium lights and they were lighting up everything out there under it from about sixty feet off the ground.  You could see cactus and rocks really clear too just like a bright sunny day. It was so dark out there ! that I could not see any sides or edges to what ever it was.  I watched it until it had gone over the other side of the saddle. I was perplexed as to what I had just seen. I thought I had seen three separate UFO’s flying together in formation.  But later after telling my wife what I had just seen. She said “well, how do you know it was three separate ones, maybe it was just one big UFO!’. Now that really got me thinking. That craft would have been huge.  I mean this saddle area it flew through is about the size of one to two football fields wide.  I heard you on the radio one night and got your web site. I thought you might like to hear about my sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294

motionless, bright orange lights in the sky that faded out;2019-01-08 20:05:00;3-5 minutes;motionless, bright orange lights in the sky that faded out Late in the evening, my wife and I were driving south on AZ State Route 347 (between Chandler and Maricopa) when I spotted two bright orange lights to the southwest.  This stretch of freeway is sparsely populated and pretty dark at night, so they shone incredibly brightly.  They also seemed to be not more than a couple hundred feet or so above the horizon, so initially I thought maybe it could have been lights from a tower of some kind, but I've never noticed them before in all my time driving that stretch of road.   I asked my wife if she saw them to which she commented that she thought it was strange that they were so orange.  I then asked her to Google if there were any kind of air fields or radio towers in that area.  Her quick search determined there shouldn't be anything in that direction.  She went back to looking at her phone, but even though I was driving, my eyes were fixated on them.  If you drew a straight line between them, they would seem to be perfec! tly parallel to the ground, and they didn't move at all, at least they didn't seem to from my perspective.  They didn't blink, they didn't pulse, they didn't move, they were just there, and bright.  It was like they were staring at me. I just stared right back at them for several minutes while I drove.  Then, seemingly for no reason, the one on the left faded away, and almost immediately after, the light on the right also faded.  They didn't blink out, they didn't disappear behind something, more like a dimmer switch, they faded and were gone.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
