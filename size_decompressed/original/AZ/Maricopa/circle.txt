They are seen tuesday through thursday 20:00 to 3:00 every week.  ((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to get photos.  PD));2013-03-29 20:00:00;Hours;They are seen tuesday through thursday 20:00 to 3:00 every week. At first I was afraid to say anything for fear of becoming a casualty in case it is something you already know that I now know too. I have been extremely careful not to tell anyone. They probably wouldn’t believe me anyway.  Now I am afraid not to contact you.  In the last year the numbers of these things have increased.  Some nights I see 8 or more of them. I solemnly swear not to tell a soul about this.  As then I would be in danger of knowing too much. If you guys already know, I don’t want to know any more about it. I know Phoenix is a hub for drone testing but a drone or a satellite would not unnecessarily waste that much of its own energy to make a light show. Please come and take a look for yourselves. I bought a 100x telescope and it did not increase the size. They are geosynchronous and move with the horizon.  They are seen in the east rising and the west descending. The light they emit is way brighter than stars. Like a planes headlights as it is approa! ching. And they go through the spectrum of colors of visible light in a second’s time. Like a rotating prism being backlit. They also appear to be rotating which may mean they are emitting a frequency around 24 to 25 Megahertz. The scan rate of my camera is about 24 Mhz. Because they are rotating the frequency is ahead or behind the scan rate on my camera. My cheap video camera is not good in low light and cannot see stars but through experiments and adjustments I have got some pretty good images. In the best one where it is enlarged although blurred it just simply disappears on camera and I did not block the lens either but it was still there to the human eye. It is my theory that they are farther away from earth than the moon but that they are watching us and have technology a million years advanced than we have. I also think they have a way of cloaking when we get too close. I also think you guys have technology that is way advanced of what the public knows but not this ! advanced and not this powerful. May I suggest contacting NASA ! and perh aps HUBBLE to examine them using x-ray, infrared, sound waves, radio waves, microwave and non-visible frequencies. I will wait for an email that is legitimate and not phishing or from a free email and will not respond unless it is from your guys.  I have only contacted you guys anyway.  I also solemnly swear to erase all data I have to protect myself and our country. I know nothing. Please email me and I will send the Videos. And you are always welcome to come here and see them for yourselves. R.S V. P.  They have a regular schedule and are more visible on crest and new moon nights usually Tuesday through Thursday between 8 pm and 10p, And 3am new ones appear.  Sometimes I can see them in broad daylight too, that is how powerful they are. Kindest Regards Mr. --------- in Maricopa, AZ. P.S. I will gladly reveal my identity and want someone to come here and see these things. ((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to get photos.  PD));32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294

Two very bright objects hovering.;2014-06-29 21:20:00;30 minutes;Two very bright objects hovering. We were driving down the 347 and these two really bright orbs about 20 miles away from each other were just hovering one over maricopa mountain and another over wild horse pass casino me and my girlfriend kept looking back because they were just hovering in the same spot far away from each other and we were like wow and we kept driving an looked back about 2 minutes later and one was on top of the other.  The location that they traveled to was very far in a very short time and for them to be right on top of each seems odd plus it's near South Mountain a hotspot for UFO sighting and it's actually still in the sky as I'm typing.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
Bright flashing light zig zagging across the sky.  ((anonymous report));2016-08-18 20:37:00;4 minutes;Bright flashing light zig zagging across the sky Went outside 8:30pm, with binoculars, waiting to see the space station. At 8:37pm saw a very bright light, bigger and brighter than a star, and lower. The light was flashing rapidly.  We thought it was the space station.  It came from the northwest going South east.  Then it started to crisscross across the sky.  Every time it changed direction, 2 lights were visible.  Left then right then left then right again, until it disappeared toward the southeast.   Looked up what we would see if in fact it was the space station and this was not it.  We caught it on a cell phone.

I am glad, I stumbled upon this website.  I am witnessing the same glowing fireballs as others are seeing in AZ.;2017-11-16 20:30:00;<5 seconds;I am glad, I stumbled upon this website.  I am witnessing the same glowing fireballs as others are seeing in AZ. Tonight is the 3rd time I've seen these lights in the sky.  I commute home from Scottsdale each day.  I exit from the I 10 and I continue on the 347, a stretch of highway that enters into Maricopa City.  Between Riggs road and Maricopa city,  I will see these glowing lights in the sky directly above Maricopa or maybe further south but its in plain view as they are directly over the 347.  I am positive other drivers heading home can see them also. The 1st time I witnessed, it looked like a Military flare, this caused for me to take my eyes from the road to the horizon, but then the  orange color got brighter, hotter and pulsated. The light then disappears, a second later I saw that light to the east, it looked to be maybe over Queencreek?, the light was faint and then it started to glow brighter till it disappeard again. 2nd event was the day before Halloween, all the conditions are the same excepts the time was maybe 30 mins early around 730pm.  I saw the orange  fireball, but this time I can see it transfer a small amount of light into and another orange ball.  This went across a large portion of the sky till 5 orange balls were attached to each other. Maybe the length of a few miles, then all the lights together increased in brightness then went out. Tonight at @845pm I saw the same 5 lights off to the east they flashed and them disappeared. Most people never see anything  crazy in the sky.  I am now seeing them on the reg.  My guess is they are coming from Barry Goldwater base and the Gov has some pretty bad azz toys, but who really knows.  Going to keep my phone handy and try too get some footage next time it's happens. I'm also glad other  people are seeing them, makes me feel alot better about posting on the crazy UFO site. Wish me luck;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
