MY BOSS SAID LOOK AT THAT.  I LOOKED AND SAW A LARGE MULTICOLORED UFO MOVING QUICKLY IN A ZIG ZAG PATTERN.  IT LOOKED VERY LARGE AND VERY FAR AWAY.   I CHECKED YOUTUBE TODAY SAW TWO VIDEOS POSTED OF EVENT/UFO THAT I SAW DATED 5/12/2016.  ONE VIDEO WAS SHOT FROM THE GROUND BY A  PERSON.  THE OTHER VIDEO WAS FROM THE ISS FEED.  SO GOT A TOP VIEW AND BOTTOM VIEW CAUGHT ON VIDEO OF THE SAME UFO I SAW.   I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT FOR SURE IT IS TECHNOLOGY THAT THE AVERAGE SOCIETY IS UNAWARE OF.  CLEARLY NOT BALLOONS OR NORMAL AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
Bright orange lights over Maricopa.;2014-12-10 20:00:00;20-25 minutes;Bright Orange Lights over Maricopa. We saw two bright orange lights at first.  Same brightness but some distance from each other over the Eastern side of Maricopa as we drove down John Wayne Parkway.   Then a third orange light appeared in between the other two.  It slowly faded from nothing into a bright light just like the other two were.   A few minutes later, the light on the far left faded out and disappeared.  As we got into town, the two that remained got closer together and seemed so close they may be touching.  Then they faded into darkness as well.   The entire event lasted about 20-25 minutes. One thing to note, there was a spotlight display happening at the same time from in front of the grocery store in the middle of town, we could see it from a few miles out of town.   We didn't get pictures because we were driving, and didn't think about it until it was too late.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
Strange cluster of bright white lights over the southwest sky;2016-02-19 18:30:00;10-15 minutes;Strange cluster of bright white lights over the southwest sky Friday Feb 19, 2016, approx 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM, I was driving from Chandler, Arizona, to our home in Maricopa, Arizona, on Hwy 347.  I was heading  south.   In the South West sky, I saw a group of lights very uniform in the shape of a rectangle.  It looked like several lights side by side and about the same amount of lights in several rows below it forming a rectangle.  It began with one rectangle and swooped of off to the left and then turned into  a second  one.  Both remained in the sky for a couple of minutes and then the first one faded away.   The second one remained for a few minutes and then also faded away.  It never dropped as if they were flares.  It remained at the same altitude for about 10 minutes or so.  It did not move.  It seemed way too high in the sky to be flares or balloons.   I saw several cars pull over to the side which I presume to watch the same thing.;32.9970058823529;-111.964338235294
