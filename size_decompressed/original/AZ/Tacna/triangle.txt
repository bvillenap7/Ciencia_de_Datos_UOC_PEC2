Brightly lit craft flew and hovered right in front of us, then disappeared.;2015-09-28 21:10:00;~15 seconds;Brightly lit craft flew and hovered right in front of us, then disappeared. 9/29/15   Last night while traveling East on Highway 8 in Arizona near Tacna, I suddenly noticed a very bright light that seemed to be atop a large rock outcropping on my right.  I placed my hand on my daughter’s arm (she was driving) to ask her what it was.   Suddenly, it started moving towards us very quickly, until it was directly in front of us over the highway about 100 yards in front of us.  We could not discern a definite shape, but we felt it was triangular and had an angled top which narrowed in what appeared to be the front of the flying object.  There were three sets of bright lights, with several lights in each set.  My daughter thought the bottom of the object was slightly rounded.  The entire sighting took approximately 15 seconds.   As the object reached the Western side of the freeway, it appeared to hesitate and “wobble”, continued into the desert about 50 feet and completely disappeared.  It was a very bright night, with a full moon.  There was no visible propulsion the craft simply disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found her to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a very good witness.  PD));32.6917;-113.9747
