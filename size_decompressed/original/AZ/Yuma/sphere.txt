2 reports - UFO over Yuma 1997 and UFO at Cape Kennedy 1960's.;1997-03-27 22:00:00;20 sec;2 reports - UFO over Yuma 1997 and UFO at Cape Kennedy 1960's. I lived in the foothills of Yuma, Arizona and one evening in March of 1997 (approximately 2 weeks after The Phoenix Lights ) I saw what looked like a disco ball, with multi-colored glittering lights. It silently floated northbound in a straight line (not descending) as I gazed east toward the Gila Mountains. It was a few degrees above the mountain ridge and about the size and brightness of the moon (when the moon is high - not it's just risen appearance) Unfortunately, buildings & trees blocked my full field of vision so I didn't get to see where it went. I watched it for about 30 seconds.  Also, another UFO incident I know was when I was a child. My father worked at Cape Kennedy (in Data processing and died in 1969) came home all excited (a very stoic man) and said something came up to one of our unmanned rockets right after it launched and like a mosquito to a man (UFO to the rocket) and checked it out at many angels and then flew off in a blink of the eye. I'm guessing this was during the Gemini missions. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
The object seemed to be playing in the clouds - like playing tag before it seemed to disappear into the cloud.;2004-07-15 19:40:00;4 minutes;The object seemed to be playing in the clouds - like playing tag before it seemed to disappear into the cloud. I use sphere to describe the craft(?) because in estimating the distance I really could not discern the shape.  I judged the distance to be about 20 miles to my east.  I live at approximately Exit 12, off Insterstate 8. At approximately 19:40 MST I was watching a thunderhead that was to my east and east of the Gila Mountains.  The thunderhead, from my observation, extended from north to south.  Below the thunderhead was a smaller, darker cloud separated from the thunderhead.  There was blue sky between the two sets of clouds.  As I watched I saw an object drop out of the thunderhead and hover in the space between the two clouds for a few seconds.  The object dropped into the small cloud, disappearing.  Suddenly the object shot out of the lower cloud and hovered again between the two for a few seconds.  Then, just as quick, it shot back into the thunderhead. Now my curiosit was up and I waited to see if the object would appear again. After roughly a minute the object dropped out of the thunderhead again.  This time after hovering for roughly 15 seconds it moved quickly north and hovered again between the two clouds.  By this time the smaller cloud had moved north somewhat and the tunderhead seemed to have gained some height.  After about 10 seconds of hovering the object shot down into the smaller cloud.  It stayed there for about 20 or 25 seconds  When it reappeared it had moved back to the south and shot out of the cloud to hover for about 10 seconds below the thunderhead.  Then it shot up into the thunderhead. I waited for it to reappear but did not see it again. The thunderhead appeared to be moving slowly north by north east in the direction of Phoenix. I had the thunderhead and smaller cloud under observation for approximately 12 minutes by the object did not reappear. It appeared that the object was playing with the clouds as the thunderhead began to break up as I continued to observe it.  The small cloud seemed to be traveling due north.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
White possibly silver ball hovering above the mountains in the Arizona desert near Yuma. No lights no wings and seem to be hovering;2020-05-17 13:30:00;15 minutes;White possibly silver ball hovering above the mountains in the Arizona desert near Yuma. No lights no wings and seem to be hovering I was a passenger in a Ford Tacoma 4 x 4. I looked over my right shoulder towards the north over a tall mountain range. I saw a white ball motionless as if it were hovering. I watched the ball for about five minutes thinking after driving I would lose visual. As we kept driving for approximately 20 minutes I maintained visual on the craft. It did not seem to move but maybe it was going the same Same speed as the car. It looks like a perfect sphere ball sometimes almost silver. It was several miles away from me and hovering approximately 8 to 15,000 feet in the air. Are used a Phone app called binoculars and attempted to get a closer view from my moving car. As I did so I for a brief short moment was able to look at the craft. It seemed a perfect circle. It was white and silver and seems almost motionless. As I focused my binocular apps on the possible craft it would seem to blur as if it had changed so the light from the sun was causing it to be silver or gy! rate almost. It made it hard to get a good picture. I watched this fear for at least 15 minutes probably more before I lost sight of it and it was nowhere to be found. There were no lights no wings. It was seems to be just hovering at times but seem to be able to stay in my view. There were no other planes around there were no lights it was over a mountain range and pure desert. It seemed very out of place and almost ominous in a fact to where I could not keep my eyes off of it. It was just a white bar possibly silver hovering above the mountain range and some white going with the speed of my car allowing me to keep ice on it for a short amount of time.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
