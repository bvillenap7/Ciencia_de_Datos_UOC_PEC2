Rectangles were outlined in black with very bright red light inside. Speed seemed to slow for an object that long in length to be able to stay airborne.  No sound at all. There were four rectangle objects in perfect in-line formation. each the same size, banking right in turn.  I put my fist out and there length exceeded my fist.the angle of all four was about 130 degrees.  All four were solid red in color.  Then top #4 blinked once then went out, #3 then blinked once and then went out.#2 and #1 followed in same order.  Myself and neighbor both watched them for a full 30 seconds before all went out.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
Stationary Object in sky northeast of Yuma AZ.;2013-11-26 15:00:00;30-40 minutes;Stationary Object in sky northeast of Yuma AZ On our way out to Sedona AZ from San Diego on 11/26/2013 traveling east on interstate 8  We saw a stationary object in the sky just northeast of Yuma AZ.   It remained there the whole time as we passed by it in the far distance. It was far away maybe beyond the mountains north of Yuma.  It never moved only lost sight of it when we drove further past it. On out way back from Sedona to San Diego.  This time west on Interstate 8 on December 1st it was still there.  Same location. In the middle of the day.  It was a bright white object in the sky.  It seemed to be rectangle but it was hard to tell due to the distance. Everyone traveling on interstate 8 had to have seen it. What was it?;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
