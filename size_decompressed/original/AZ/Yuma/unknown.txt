I looked out my window & saw a black object very high in the sky. The object did not reflect the sunlight as the planes flying near-by were, nor did it have any flashing lights as all aircraft should. It was so high I could not make out the shape. It appears to be suspended from something but is way too high to be hanging. It did not seem to move. Keep in mind we were travelling at 80 MPH  & my 15 yr old son & I watched it for approx 45mins & it was still in full view. My husband was driving but saw it as well. I have a friend who is from that area & travels to Yuma once or twice or month, I asked her about the object & she says her family sees it all the time. My father works for the military & has a Top Secret security clearance but of course he couldn't (or wouldn't) tell me anything. I'm sure it has something to do with the military (I hope) but I grew up on military bases & have never noticed anything like that before.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
Glowing streak of blue cloud passes quickly over the area in Yuma, AZ.;2014-01-10 20:00:00;2 minutes;glowing streak of blue cloud passes quickly over the area in Yuma, AZ At approximately 9:00pm on Friday night, I was sitting outside on my back porch when I looked up and saw an odd bluish bank of cloud approaching from the western horizon. What made me notice it was the color - a bright, glowing aqua blue.  There was no wind or any breeze, yet it moved quickly across the sky, and in less than a minute it was overhead.  I had a tablet computer with me and by the time I snapped a picture of the mass, it was already past my house and heading east.  It was not the moon or city lights that caused the bright glow.  The glow was gone within two minutes. I've been looking for reports of Aurora Borealis sightings in southern Arizona, but so far none have come up.  I'm hoping that someone else in AZ saw this and got better pictures.  It resembled Aurora Borealis to some extent but had a misty, amorphous quality to it.  It moved away too quickly to be a solar flare, in my opinion.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
