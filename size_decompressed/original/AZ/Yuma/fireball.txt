Bright object in sky disappears and reappears. Seems to also emit smaller objects.;2008-01-14 19:00:00;20-30 mins;Bright object in sky disappears and reappears. Seems to also emit smaller objects. We saw a large bright object in southeast Arizona. This siting was very similar to the one reported in Stephensville.  The difference is that we (my son, husband, and I) were not very close and could not determine the size, nor did we hear any noise. This object was observed appearing, disappearing, and reappearing several times southeast of I-8 on our way from Yuma to Gila Bend. The object also appeared to emit two or three smaller bright objects, which hovered for a bit and then quickly disappeared. A very strange siting unlike anything we've ever seen. A friend of my son's was driving from Phoenix to Gila Bend to meet us and also saw it.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
