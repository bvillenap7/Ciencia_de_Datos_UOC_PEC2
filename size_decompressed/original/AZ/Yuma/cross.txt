Lone star-shaped ufo sighted over Yuma, Az on Christmas Eve, 2013.;2013-12-24 21:00:00;3-5 minutes;Lone star-shaped ufo sighted over Yuma, Az on Christmas Eve, 2013 On Christmas Eve at 9pm, I let my dog out into the front yard to do his business before retiring for the evening.  We live on a golf course a street away from the 18th hole.  I noticed what looked like a beautiful golden star moving over the green.   Since there are town homes and tall palm trees located in between, I moved over in the direction it was headed to try to get another look at it.  I saw it again and as it wasn't moving very fast, I decided to run in to get my cell phone to try to get a picture or video.   When I returned, I could see that it had moved too far south to get any video.  It then faded away into the night sky.  It made no sound, and, in fact, I believe others saw it.  I could hear people speaking excitedly in the distance.   Would like to know if anyone else reported it or got video of it.  Thanks much.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
