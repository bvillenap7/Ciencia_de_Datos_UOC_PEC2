Videoed 2 egg shaped, multi-color pulsing craft near full moon above Yuma.;2016-01-23 10:30:00;12 minutes;Videoed 2 egg shaped, multi-color pulsing craft near full moon above Yuma. I am visiting my father, getting cheap teeth work done in Mexico.  I live in Northern California, and have submitted to the NUFORC site 2 previous sightings from the 90's.   I am a programs coordinator at my local non-profit teen center with science teaching as a background of my education.  I was taking pictures of the big bright moon from my father's lot in Yuma.  Playing with the iPad camera grabbing at the moon with my hand and silly stuff...switched to video and realized the lights near the moon were pulsing multiple colors...I was filming with my selfie camera which I believe has a clearer picture then the outward shot cameraâ€¦   After around 12 minutes of filming these craft, I moved towards the front of the lot to try to see it from another angle, but lost it...couldn't find it again then the camera shut off...2 craft hovering in place spinning, I couldn't see them with my naked eye.  I can send you video if you would like.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
