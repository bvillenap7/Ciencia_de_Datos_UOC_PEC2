V-SHAPED ORANGE GLOWING OBJECT THAT MOVED STRAIGHT UP UNTIL IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE.;2004-11-24 02:00:00;6 minutes;V-SHAPED ORANGE GLOWING OBJECT THAT MOVED STRAIGHT UP UNTIL IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE. ON 11-24-2004 AT AROUND 0200 HOURS MYSELF AND ANOTHER OFFICER WERE ON PATROL IN THE YUMA AREA TRAVELING EASTBOUND. WHILE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION THE DRIVING OFFICER STOPPED THE VEHICLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROADWAY AND ASKED ME TO LOOK TO THE NORTH AT A BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHT THAT WAS APPEARING OVER THE YUMA AREA. AFTER REALIZING THAT WE HAD STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAODWAY WE DECIDED TO MOVE APPROX. 1/4 OF A MILE UP THE ROAD PAST AN INTERSECTION TO STOP AT A CIRLCE K. AS WE EXITED OUR VEHICLE WE WERE APPROACHED BY TWO MALES SUBJECTS ON BIKE'S ASKING WHAT THE FORMATION IN THE NIGHT SKY WAS. WHILE TRYING TO EXPLAIN OUR DISBELIEF SEVERAL OTHER WITNESSES INCLUDING THE CIRCLE K EMPLOYEE WALKED OUT AND OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A V-SHAPE OR CHEVERON SHAPE FORMATION IN THE NIGHT SKY. THE FORMATION APPEARED TO HAVE BRIGHT GLOWING CIRCLES FOLLOWING THE SHAPE OF THE OBJECT. AS WE INVESTIGATED FURTHER THE OFFICER I WAS WITH ASKED OUR COMMUNICATION CENTER TO CALL OUR LOCAL MARINE STATION TO SEE IF THEY HAD AIRCRAFTS IN THE AIR. WE WERE ADVISED LATER THAT THE TOWERS WERE DOWN AND NOTHING WAS UP IN THE AIR, WE WERE ALSO ADVISED THAT NOTHING HAD APPEARED ON THERE RADAR SENSOR. THE OFFICER I WAS WITH IS A 22 YEAR RETIRED MARINE WHO HAS EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF AORCRAFT AND BY HIS OWN ADMISSION HE SAID THAT HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH TECHNOLOGY LIKE WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT. THE OFFICER AND MYSELF STILL IN DISBELIEF GRABBED A SET OF BINO'S. AFTER LOOKING AT THE OBJECT IT APPEARED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF VAPOR ADMITTING OUT OF IT. IT WAS LEAVING SOME SORT OF VAPOR TRAIL BEHIND THE OBJECT. AGAIN IT LOOKED TO BE V-SHAPED WITH BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS OUTLINING THE SHAPE. THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECT WAS BLANK, THERE WAS NO FORMATION ABOVE THE LIGHTS AROUND OR BELOW. IT LOOKED LIKE A V WITH LIGHTS. AFTER SEVERAL MOMENTS I REALIZED THAT I NEEDED TO PHOTOGRAPH THE OCCURANCE. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO LOAD MY DIGITAL CAMERA THE OTHER OFFICER ADVISED ME THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING AWAY FROM US AT A MODERATE RATE OF SPEED. AS I LOOKED BACK THE OBJECT WAS ALREADY OUT OF MY VIEW. THE OFFICER THAT HAD CONSISTANCE SURVAILANCE SAID THAT HE COULD STILL SEE IT. AFTER ABOUT A 30 SECOUND DELAY HE SAID IT WAS OUT OF HIS VIEW. IT WAS AN EVENT ETHER ONE OF US HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. THE SHAPE LIFTED STRAIGHT AWAY FROM US UNTIL OUT OF OUR VIEW. IS THERE TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE LIKE THAT? THE OTHER OFFICER DESCRIBED THE EVENT AS BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME, OR THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME , HE WENT ON TO SAY  WE JUST SEEN SOMETHING I DONT THINK WE WERE MEANT TO SEE. WE ARE STILL UNSURE WHAT EXACTLY WE WERE LOOKING AT BUT THE EVENT IS SURE TO STAY WITH US A LONG TIME.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
