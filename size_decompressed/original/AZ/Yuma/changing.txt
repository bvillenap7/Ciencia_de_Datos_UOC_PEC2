Strange morphing UFO with brilliant translucent colors At around 4:45am on Aug 22, 2008 I walked outside to check on my animals. As I was looking for my cats, I noticed a flashing object in the sky. It was a round looking object, which I initially assumed a star or planet. But as I continued to watch it, I was fascinated by the flashy colors it was emitting. It seems every color in the rainbow was flashing, right before my eyes. I quickly ran inside my home, and grabbed my camera. Unfortunately, I do not really know how to use this fancy pro camera, and recorded it with the setting to auto. This caused the object to focus in and out. Altogether there is about 25 minutes of footage. my 19 year old son also witnessed this object while walking home from work (we live on base housing). The very last section was a video I shot of the moon (I was trying to compare the moon to what I had just seen).  The degree angle can be pretty easy to identify because I used a reference point of a house with the object I was filming. I know that there are strange happenings at Fort Huachuca, AZ (Blue Beam Project...etc) and their base is but a few hours to the east of me, which coincidentally points in the same direction of where the object was hovering. I cannot determine how far out this object was. I first thought it was a star.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
