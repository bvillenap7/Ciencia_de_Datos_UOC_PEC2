In fact, I recommend that you go that website and check it-it may all still be there. I reside in PA, but have an interest in the Yuma area as a friend of mine cmps there,near the Cargo Muchcacho mountains in Imperial CTY.CA.I like to check the cloud cover there as friend uses solar panels on his RV and a good charging day has no clouds. Thanks.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
Orange Lights Over Yuma;2008-07-23 22:20:00;20 seconds;Orange Lights Over Yuma A series of orange lights were spotted for a few moments SW of the Foothills area of Yuma, AZ at approx. 10:20 PM, July 23, 2008.  There were four to six symetrical lights arranged in a perfect line and were seen to hover briefly before completely disappearing.  I have lived in this area for two years and am very familiar with the normal air traffic traveling past, i.e. helicopters, civilian and military aircraft, yet this group of lights was completely different than anything I have seen before.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
Myself and 4 other people saw 7 yellow lights hovering in the sky each one appearing and disappearing onme by one;2008-07-31 22:16:00;10 minutes;Myself and 4 other people saw 7 yellow lights hovering in the sky each one appearing and disappearing onme by one I'm not sure exactly what my husband and I saw, but we think it might have been a UFO formation.  I was taking my husband back to work at 10:16pm when we stopped at a red light.  In the east-southeast ww saw 3 yellow lights about 45 degrees up in the sky.  The lights were in a straight horizontal line, and were evenly spaced apart.  They looked like this:  . . . I asked my husband what he thought they could be.  I originally thought it was flares that someone had sent up.  As the light turned green and we started to make a left another light appeared above and slightly to the right of the light farthest to the left.  It just appeared out of nowhere.  My husband and I thought this was rather strange, so we continued turning left and then pulled over and parked in a parking lot and got out of the car.  About 10 seconds after the new light appeared, the light on the lower left side faded away.  About 10 seconds after that, another light appeared above the original lights, next to new light, but spaced out more.  ABout 10 seconcds after that the middle light on the bottem faded, 10 seconds later another light appeared next to the new lights, also evenly spaced out.  About 10 seconds after that the last light on the bottom faded away, and 10 seconds after that a firth light appeared next to the others on the top. The were also in a straight horizontal line evenly spaced, but these were more spaced out than the first 3.  They looked more like this:  .   .   .   . I'll try to give you a picture of what happened as best I can on the computer. 10:16pm  .  10:18pm  . 10:18pm  . 10:19pm  .   10:19pm  .    10:19pm  .     10:20pm  .  The 4 lights stayed stationary in the sky for about 5 minutes.  My husband called his boss and told him to come look outside, he was maybe 1/2 mile from where we were.  A couple of other people came out also and one of them got a recording onhis cell phone of the 4 lights and them fading away one by one.  I t reminded me of the lights that were reported in Phoenix a several years ago.  I'm not sure what we saw, but maybe you guys can figure it out. Thank you;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506

As I crossed the point of contact the UFO was at its highest point to the south.  I didn't hear any engine and could not understand why a plane would be flying so low that late at night.
