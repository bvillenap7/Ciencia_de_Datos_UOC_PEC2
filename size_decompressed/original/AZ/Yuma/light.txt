Perceptions in reality.;1988-03-15 02:00:00;don't know;Perceptions in reality. Dont remember much, but I always thought of it as a dream.  My mother and I were going to the store to get some chips I think.  We got into the car and I saw this light in the sky.  It seemed to be changing colors and coming closer.  Its distance was has to figure maybe a few thousand feet or so.  It was still in the sky to the west.  For some reason I became extreamly fearful, freaked out is another word for it.  I remember an extreamly bright light hitting the car and looking over at my mom who was going to sleep.  That is when I really began to freak, and then I woke up in bed.  It took me a few months or so before I would sleep in my room again.  At the time I was perhaps 13 or so. When I was younger I had dreams that I would be woken up during the night an there was a small figure next to my bedside, it gave off a light like one of those light sticks.  I always though of it as an angel because of the light but really I dont know.  Perhaps they were only dreams, wish I could figure that out. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in March 1988 is approximate.

Pinpoint light movement.;1999-04-25 02:30:00;2 seconds;Pinpoint light movement. I was driving along I-8 across Arizona... I pulled into a rest area to urinate... UPon walking back to the car... I was marvelling at the silence in the desert... I looked up in the sky and right after this I saw a distinct white light dart and then zig-zag across the sky at high altitude... (at least 30,000 feet) After this movement, this light vanished or went out or plain old just disappeared...;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
Something that looked like a rocket, very bright, flying into the sky and then disappearing.;2002-03-15 19:30:00;10 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Report of missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  PD)) Something that looked like a rocket, very bright, flying into the sky and then disappearing. My friends and I were on a road trip to San Diego, and right before we got to Yuma, there was a very bright light flying into the sky. We saw it come from behind a mountain, and it flew upwards in a straight line. It got very bright and there was an oval halo around it, kind of a vapor trail. We thought it was either a rocket or a flare, but we couldn't see any defining characteristics. It was just a very bright light. It stayed bright as it ascended, and then it disappeared. As the sun was below the horizon, the sky wasn't very bright, but the smoke trail glowed for a really long time after the light vanished. It could have been anything, there are military installations around there somewhere, so it could have been a plane or missle. But, it also could have been Alien Grays. Who knows? There were three of us in the car. We all saw it. We are all in our early 20's and pretty cynical, but it freaked us all out.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
Several hovering globes of yellow/orange light in the sky outside of Yuma, AZ;2003-06-04 20:15:00;2.5 hrs.;Several hovering globes of yellow/orange light in the sky outside of Yuma, AZ My family and I were driving East on the 8 fwy and noticed several globes of yellow/orange light in the sky apx. 20 miles outside of Yuma, AZ at apx. 8:15pm.  These globes were in a formation of 2 vertical lines - there seems to be 8 globes all together.  They were directly above a mountain.  Then, they seemed to just burn out.  Apx. 15 mins. later we saw them again - this time there were 5 globes just hovering in the sky in a V type formation (all flat land - no mountains), no noticable movement.  These 5 globes of light disappeared - 3 burned out, then the remaining ones individually burned out (I say burned out, beacuse they seemed to dim slightly and then turn off).  Another 20 mins. or so passed by and there were 3 globes that reappeared in the sky, still just hovering.  They continued to appear, disappear and then reappear in different places in the sky.  This continued until apx. 10:45pm.  My husband and I finally pulled off at a rest stop to try and capture them on video and take a few pictures.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
White light in the sky near Yuma, AZ;2006-08-06 20:00:00;30 Sec.;White light in the sky near Yuma, AZ We saw a light in the South Western sky.  It flashed like an airplane strobe once then it didn't flash again for about 10 sec it was very high in altitude then it fashed again much further north than the previous flash.  It then flashed a third and final time again about 10 to 15 seconds later again further north then we didn't see anymore flashes of light.  We thought it was unusual, and decided to report it.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506

((HOAX??))  orange lights seen over the Yuma, Az sky.;2008-07-31 22:00:00;20 min;orange lights seen over the Yuma, Az sky I was driving home then a friend called me to say she was seeing lights and thought they were ufos coming for her. I told her to take a picture and to show me later. As I kept on driving, I saw the objects come into view. They were circular and orange in color. They were perfectly clear as there were no clouds in the sky. At first it was a group of 3 then one more appeared then another.  The first 3 spread out and made a straight line joining the other 2. One then disappeared  and left 4. They were perfectly spaced and stayed in the sky for a good 10 min. Then they started to disappear one by one till they were all completely gone.  I called in to the local TV station and they assumed them to be flairs but the military base here had not responded to the stations calls.

This sighting was EXTREMELY similar to Endeavor space shuttle night time fly-by's.;2009-01-16 18:25:00;3-5;This sighting was EXTREMELY similar to Endeavor space shuttle night time fly-by's. I have seen many UFO’S in Yuma for quite sometime, and have been always disappointed because I never had a camera at hand until today during this sighting. I was able to instantly recognize that this was very similar if not exactly what I have seen in previous times in Yuma. They are major military bases in Yuma, and I truly believe that these bases DO withhold technology from which you will see in my video. I have seen events of the space shuttles zooming across the sky’s at night, if you have seen that happen then you can DEFINITELY compare how this event looked extremely similar. It was a bright white light that floated across the sky, catching my intention, enough to run inside and yell at my parents at the top of my lungs to come outside and witness this. I was so sure that this is what I have seen in the past multiple times, I even told them that this light would zoom away at thousands of miles an hour once it reaches the outside skirts of Yuma. This light did just that. My father said that that was the most significant part of this sighting, because I predicted or just pretty much knew it was going zoom out of sight at supersonic speeds. Earlier this year I sighted what had been supposedly the space shuttle “Discovery” or “Endeavor”. Our local Yuma Daily Sun news report gave approximate times for the sighting of the space station flying past, and me being a constant observer of our skies I had seen this space station one night thinking it was a UFO later to find out it was “Discovery” or “Endeavor” that was flying by. I saw this light two nights in a row. Both nights sighting were extremely similar to what you seen is this video I took that I am now reporting to you guys. The only difference being between this sighting and the “Discovery” or “Endeavor” sighting is this video is shot while the sky is lightly lit. The sun was up enough to see the sunset on the horizon. This UFO was bee-lining across the sky at a steady, slow , floating pace. It was about 30 seconds later after this video ended, due to lack of memory on the camera, that the light zoom off at supersonic speeds right as it reached the outskirts of Yuma County. While I was shooting the video I was stating that the flashing red light was “BELOW”  white light. It “WAS” below the white light just before I shot the video. I did not realize the flashing red light from the plane had been coming toward us almost directly and had risen above the white light which you see in the video. The only conclusion I can get out of that is either this white light was below this plane and the plane gained altitude, or this white light is just outside the atmosphere and created an optical illusion even to myself. So the white light can appear to an observer to either be below the atmosphere in the skies of Yuma County or it was moving at incredible rates outside the atmosphere and floated across the sky very similar to that of the satellite. So let’s say if this object was in space then it being its size and the brightness of it, this object must be gigantic enough to reflect the sun’s light off it to appear so large. So one way or another the size of this thing is massive , and you can compare it to the plane flying past. Because the plane was flying by is going to make it much easier for you guys to study the size of this object and the direction its going. And myself living in Yuma since day one, and can bet my bottom dollar that the flashing red light was from a Jumbo Commercial Airliner, no doubt in my mind, that plane is heading right for California. The fence you see in my back yard it going parallel with North and South. The airliner is heading west. The light is Heading NW from what I observed. Let me make this very Clear. This Object did not have supersonic speed until it reached the outskirts of Yuma. AS SOON AS IT DID it zoomed up to supersonic speeds and the lightly gradually at a somewhat fast pace got smaller and kind of dimmed smaller and smaller. A satellites light doesn’t even dim out like that. Satelites that I have seen in our skies did not move at same high speeds as this. Had the white light actually be in space. If it were then this white light would beat any satellite up there in a race hands down. And that was when the white light was just floating across the Yuma sky, so theres no telling just how fast this white light took off at the end of its descent. I watched this white light come across the sky from the deep south of Yuma, and I could bet my bottom dollar it was in Mexico’s air space before it reached Yuma. Do our space shuttles travel from South to North? From what I understand they do not. I would love it if you guys could get back to me and let me know what you guys think of this and if this helps you with your research. Thank for taking the time to read this. Thanks a billion!;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
Lights turning on and off in a line;2009-08-18 21:14:00;7 minutes;Lights turning on and off in a line My boyfriend and I were parked on a back road watching the stars near Avenue D on the west side of Yuma.  We started to see a couple of orange lights flash on in a row and then turn off one by one.  We thought they were flares at first, but we didn't see any smoke coming from the lights.  We were getting a little sad that we didn't have enough time to grab the camera and catch it, when all the sudden more lights turned on.  Excited and a little scared, I grabbed my camera and started recording.  These lines of lights showed up a few times but I always managed to miss it all due to the fact that when they appeared it was only for a couple seconds.  This is the best video that captured exactly what we saw.  There was no noise at all, no sounds of planes, and no smoke coming from the lights.  After seeing what we saw in the video, the lights stopped lighting up and we did not see them anymore.  In the video there is one light that shows up at the beginning and then right around the 3 minute mark is when a whole bunch showed up.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
Three white round lights morphed into two, changed colors and then disappeared in the sky near Yuma, AZ.;2010-01-15 23:35:00;15 seconds;Three white round lights morphed into two, changed colors and then disappeared in the sky near Yuma, AZ. We were driving north to south on 95 perhaps 10-12 miles north of Yuma but just south of the Proving Ground.  My wife was driving and this is what she saw:   I saw three white rounds lights in synchronized formation traveling low about the same height maybe slightly higher as the phone lines along the highway.  They were flying in swooping and rapid movements.  I was trying to figure out what it was and finally woke my husband, and said, ‘Hey, I think it is a UFO.’   I then concentrated on driving while he watched.  This is what he saw.   I saw the same three lights and immediately they changed directions away from us, very low to the ground and the 3 morphed into 2 lights changing colors and disappeared out of sight.  I am not sure, if it totally disappeared or if it was hidden by the small hillsides as we traveled away.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
Three eyewitnesses of approximately 20 lighted objects in the southwest desert moving in a northwesterly direction;2010-08-07 20:10:00;20 seconds;Three eyewitnesses of approximately 20 lighted objects in the southwest desert moving in a northwesterly direction Objects were moving from South East to North West at moderate speed.  No precise formation, but moving up and down as they traveled northwest (unusual movments). This happened near sunset as we viewed them in the easterly sky (clear sky).  There seemed to be a shape to them, but appeared transparent.  There was a light, almost like a reflection of the sun on them. There were stragglers, one dipped down extremely low on the northern horizon, and then gained altitude moving toward the others. They eventually moved out of our sight in the northwesterly direction.

Yuma UFO May 15 with incredible movement.  Video;2013-05-15 20:30:00;4 minutes;Yuma UFO May 15 with incredible movement.  Video I was coming out of a Cracker Barrel Restaurant, headed back to hotel on foot when i saw what i thought was an abnormally bright satellite headed northwest.  I watched the light for about 10 seconds until i realized that i had my Iphone in my hand.  I took approximately 4 minutes of video of this thing moving through the sky in every direction.  I kept building and trees in view so as to gauge speed and movement of the object.   It would accelerate instantly then stop and change direction instantly.  The object was without doubt the brightest thing in the sky.  Stadium light in the sky would be the closest description i could give.   The video gives the brighntness of this object no justice but does clearly show the incredible movement of the object.   I have saved a permanent copy of the video on my hard drive for anyone who thinks i have  hoaxed this and have posted a video on you tube under the title Yuma UFO May 15.  It was not a helicopter or plane.  Look for! yourself.   The File is in HD and 434 MB.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
