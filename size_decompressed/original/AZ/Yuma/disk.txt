Loss of hours while driving to Yuma, Az;1991-06-01 02:00:00;7 hours/uncertain;Loss of hours while driving to Yuma, Az Time and date are not specific, as it was when I was about 18. i am now 30. A friend and I were driving, I was the passenger, to Yuma, Az. At about 2:00 a.m., I estimate we were about 15 minutes from Yuma. We saw in the desert about half a mile away a UFO with changing colored lights, the changed so frequently, maybe going around the craft, I cant be specific of all the colors. We pulled over to watch it for about 3-5 minutes and started to take off and we were watching it as we drove off very scared trying not to panic.  The next thing i recall is we are driving in the exact same place, but it is now about 8-9 a.m. I know we were in the same place because city lights were visable at night as the same in a.m. I remember being in a very calm state and not even talking about what we had seen, just very calm and relaxed. I cannot account for the hours in between.  I have no recall of any events of being abducted, but have no explaination for the loss of hours. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Large object on the ground..then it vanished before our eyes!;2005-10-22 03:00:00;5 Minutes approx;Large object on the ground..then it vanished before our eyes! We were driving on I-8 early in the morning through Arizona, outside Yuma I believe it was. I do know there was an airbase in the distance, close to the border, if I'm not mistaken. Straight ahead there were very bright amber lights I kept seeing go on, then off..over again. I thought I was seeing things. Then I thought it was a plane flying really low or something. It did that 3x before I finally realized my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. I asked my husband who was driving if he had seen them, but he had not. They blinked on and off rather quickly at first. However, as we got closer he finally saw what I had, but this time there were several lights that had went on at once, and they stayed on longer than before and then some would go off slowly, while others turned off quickly..if that makes sense. We drove closer to the object, so apparently it was sitting still. We came up on it rather fast. We were slightly elevated from the hill we were driving over, if I remember correctly, and the object was in the flat desert area. That's when we saw the object close to the ground in full view, near the highway. There was no one on the highway but us at the time from what I remember. It frightened us once we got close enough to it. It was massive. The lights were incredibly bright, but you could look right at them. It was so big. The amber glow was nothing like I've seen before. Maybe 5-6 lights..they kept going off and on, but not in succession like one right next to the other. I don't know for sure if it was a pattern per say, it just wasn't the same every time is what I mean. My husband actually became startled and he pulled over immediately since it seemed as though we would drive next to it if we went further. I'd say we were about 1/4 mile away. We got out of the car immediately, and then we heard jets overhead. We counted 4? They were in a V pattern initially from what we could tell, then they scattered overhead. The object was illuminated slightly by a large light that was next to the highway, and there were some lights next to the water storage units that we had parked by in order to get out of view. The object was dark metallic in color, I'd say like pewter. Absolutely no sound, no dust from the sand underneath. It was larger than a commercial plane I'm guessing, maybe twice as big?  After the jets scrambled, we looked back at the disk(?), which was rounded in the front, although we couldn't make out if it was round completely, just the front of it was bowed. I saw things on top, but they weren't sticking out. It looked more like welded doors maybe, I dunno for sure. It happened rather fast, and it was hard to believe what we were seeing. We didn't have a camera or recording device..and honestly, that wasn't the first thing we thought to grab at that time. I don't even remember how we got to the other side of the highway. All I remember is that there was a water storage area next to the highway, and it kind of hid us from view. I think my husband just didn't want us to be spotted, that's how startled he was (and he rarely gets startled). I just remember rushing to get out of view and that we wanted to turn our lights off as soon as we could so that we didn't draw any attention to ourselves. After we looked back down at the disk from looking at the jets, it literally...I mean literally...vanished before our eyes.  No dust.  No sound.  No hovering and then shooting off...NO NOTHING! We literally saw it vanish!  How is this possible?  Has anyone saw this before, how can something vanish as if it were never there? It was so big, and then nothing.  The jets were still flying overhead, and then they finally left.  We were both just stunned..and then drove on as soon as we could to get away from the area. We actually didn't talk about it the rest of the way to our destination..I still cannot believe what happened.  We've only told very close family what happened. I've never seen one that close before, nor vanish before my eyes.  I will never in my life forget the color of those lights.  The most brilliant beautiful amber, so crystal clear..incredibly crisp light..yet it didn't hurt my eyes to look at them. Has anyone else witnessed this?;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
Disc object over Yuma, AZ and BIG red object seen from airplane.;2006-12-11 17:00:00;~ 1 hour;Disc object over Yuma, AZ and BIG red object seen from airplane. My co-worker and I were driving on business from Phoenix,AZ to Yuma,AZ on HWY 8 going west/southwest.  Through most of the trip we are talking about UFO's and supernatural programs on the History Channel.  I can admit that I was looking everywhere to see if I saw something unusual in the skies, since I know Arizona has a high volume of sightings. All of the sudden we see an old airplane maneuvering north of us near Yuma,AZ.  It doesn't look military it just looks like someone is playing around.  All of the sudden I look further behind the airplane and I notice something just sitting there in the sky. It was pretty far away and we could not tell what it was.  The objects were in a disk shape and white metallic color.  The object was pretty bright for a clear sunny day.  We pulled over to see if I can take good pictures of it.  My co-worker mentions of rotation on the object, but I could not see it.  The object stayed in the same spot for quite a long time and barely moved.  It looked like it would grow slightly in size and go back to the original size.  We could even see the object entering Yuma.  That same night there was a high activity of black helicopters near the MX and AZ border.  I do not know if it was the Border Patrols or the black helicopters that I've heard try to chase UFO's.  This event happened on December 11, 2006 and pictures will be e-mailed.  I also noticed that some of my pictures are similar to the pictures that a person from Argentina submitted on the 25th of December in mufon.com main page. (ANOTHER sighting that happened in October 20006.  Unfortunately, no pictures were taken.  SEE BELOW.)  I was flying from Dallas to California on a business trip.  Something up to the date of this event told me to have my camera in hand during the flight which I unfortunately didn't.  We are over 30,000 probably over New Mexico or Arizona, not sure.  Clear bright day.  All of the sudden I see that a big red round object is floating in the air about 2:00 and about 500 feet down in relation of the airplane.  My first instinct was that this object was not suppose to be there.  It looked like a giant bowie (sp).  As we are flying by it I noticed that on the other side there was this metallic object attached to the object.  I looked around the airplane to see if anyone hesitated, but no one seemed to see it except me.  I researched weather balloons and this thing was at least 10x bigger than the weather balloon pictures that I googled.  Also, in my opinion, a balloon will probably not be floating over 30,000 in the skies.  I'm still kicking myself today because I did not have a camera with me.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506

Saw a hub-cab-shaped disc at 2AM 10 Mar 2012, hovering over corner of 4th Ave & 27th St in Yuma, AZ;2012-03-10 02:00:00;~10 minutes;Saw a hub-cab-shaped disc at 2AM 10 Mar 2012, hovering over corner of 4th Ave & 27th St in Yuma, AZ Cannot remember exact date it was either March 9 or March 10 of 2012, but I am posting this now just to record it somewhere, as I've only just found out about this site. I woke up at approximately 2:00 AM (unsure of the exact time) and got out of bed to get a drink of water.  While in my kitchen I saw a flash of light through the curtains and it startled me.  I went to open the door to look outside and saw storm-clouds rolling by overhead, so I figured the flash must have been from lightning.   As I shut the door, I saw a bright flash light up the window again, but this time it was sustained for a few seconds, much like car headlights in the window (which was impossible because window isn't facing a road or any cars) but a lot more brilliant.   I reached for the door and went outside, walked to the front of the building where I lived and looked out up the street to the main thoroughfare (4th avenue). At the corner of 4th and and 27th street, just above a restaurant that is there, a hub-cap shaped object hovered roughly 40-45 feet above the street.  It was silver in color, had some small lights on the edge of it and on the top, ranging from red, green and white.  I'd estimate the disc itself approximately 75 feet in diameter.  Underneath it looked like a series of pulsing lightning bolts firing inward to a central point, similar to spokes on a bicycle tire.  The lightning bolts were an odd color, like the blue of a gas flame.  There was a misty blue aura on the underside of the object as well.   Object was quiet and I don't recall hearing any sound with it, but I felt a strong sense of static in the air. I don't know why, but I only watched the object for a few seconds, then I turned around,  went back to my apartment and went back to bed.   For some reason I have a dream-like partial memory of seeing the same object hovering over my apartment building, blotting out a portion of the cloudy night sky.  I wrote the details of the sighting down in my diary the next morning.   There were no other witnesses (to my knowledge) and I haven't mentioned this to anyone until now.

Orange saucer vanished and left a black trail leading down to the surface of the Earth.;2016-07-19 05:20:00;30 minutes;Orange saucer vanished and left a black trail leading down to the surface of the Earth. There was a very shiny light, in the distance, of my window.  Suddenly, I woke up my brother to see it and it has moved location, we were still able to see it, and 10 mins later, the lights went out exotically fast leaving a blackish cloud in the sky like if it has vanished, and the other saucer in the distance was gone too, but without a cloud.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
