Small red dot zoomed in at high speeds, came up to us. Saw the craft in slight detail.;1994-08-20 23:00:00;1 minute;Small red dot zoomed in at high speeds, came up to us. Saw the craft in slight detail. Sometime in august a few years back, there was a meteor shower. My younger brother and I decided to watch the show. We were outside and watching the meteors when we noticed a red glow. We thought it was an airplane when it zoomed in at extreme speeds that no plane or helicopter could reproduce. It zoomed in, my brother and I were staring at it. It had red lights and something that looked to be windows, I dont know what exactly they were. The shape was a football kind of shape, maybe more oval, but It had to have been no further than 500 feet above us. It made no sound that I heard, and I couldnt see anything or anyone inside. We got scared and ran inside. Less than a minute later i ran back outside and there was nothing in the sky. I am 100% certain it was NOT a meteor.

Large white sphere observed East of Yuma for about 50 minutes.  Disapeared when military craft aproached.;2003-01-01 09:20:00;50 minutes;Large white sphere observed East of Yuma for about 50 minutes.  Disapeared when military craft aproached. January first, 2003. Driving on rout 8 from West to East, having passed Yuma about 15 to 20 miles behind, we noticed a bright white ovoid object to the North, above the mountain range.  I mentioned the fact to my family my wife and two teenage daughters, and we started to speculate what it could be.  We quickly discarded that the object could be a plane, blimp, weather balloon or cloud.  What was odd was the apparent size of the object and the fact that it was stationary, floating or hovering in the sky. I stopped on several occasions during the next half hour to photograph the object.  Traveling at an average of 80 miles an hour, we were able to see the object for over 50 miles, and still distinguish it clearly. The shape looked a little different from this latter angle, a shade appeared in the middle of the object that looked more cigar shaped than previous. We thought that it could be two ovoid shapes together or a peanut shaped object (see photos).   At approximately 10:10 AM two military craft were coming in from East to west over the highway. I assumed that they were military because of the fact that they were leaving vapor trails, and were flying side by side, a formation civilian planes do not oftenly practice. At seeing these planes, I asked my girls to see what the UFO would do and they mentioned that it had disappeared.  Because the mountain range was low in comparison to the height of the object, the fact that we were on a straight away, and the fact that we had observed the object moments before, we concluded that in fact it did disappear and was not obscured by the scenery.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506

Moon sized bright green oval shaped light with smaller red light attaches to the front of the object floating across Pheonix sky.;2019-12-06 21:00:00;9:20 PM;Moon sized bright green oval shaped light with smaller red light attaches to the front of the object floating across Pheonix sky. Driving on the 8 East right after Yuma 105 miles from Pheonix I spotted a bright green, oval shaped object the exact size of a full moon with a small red circle shaped light in the front of it. The color of the green light was a faded green, not as green as a green traffic light, but a pastel green, the red circle shaped light attached to the front was a red stop light color red. It was smaller than the oval shaped object but it was also large, I cannot confirm a size that I can compare it too. It was to the right side of the road in the sky. As I was driving. The location was above the desert, not above the actual road I was driving upon. The object came in slowly through the clouds, there was no rain but due to the weather it came through the foggy clouds, appeared and floated towards the right direction, approximately 3 seconds long, then disappeared behind the clouds. A truck driver also pulled over at the nearest resting area as if they stopped to see a! s well I did not ask the truck driver due to safety reasons.;32.6973067164176;-114.578871548506
