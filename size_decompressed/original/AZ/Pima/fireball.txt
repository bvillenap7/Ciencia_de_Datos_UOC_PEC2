Round, silent, stationary ball motionless in NW sky disappearing when approached by jet fighters.;2000-02-07 19:40:00;5 min;Round, silent, stationary ball motionless in NW sky disappearing when approached by jet fighters. While waiting for my husband to come home from work I went out to look at the stars.  We do this frequently.  We live at the base of Mr. Graham where the Large Binocular Telescope and the Vatican Telescope are.  When I looked to the NW I saw a yellow ball.  It was almost over head and I could tell it was not a star.  It was motionless & silent  As I I continued to watch it I could hear aircraft approaching.  They were coming from the direction of Phoenix (possibly  Luke AFB).  I saw two, what appeared to be jet fighters, approach the object.  Then the object disappeared just as if a light switch had been turned off.  The jets turned around and went back the direction they came from.  I was shocked! I have been a registered nurse for 25yrs and thought I had seen everything. I know I should have reported this sooner but I felt sort of wierd about it as I was the only one I knew of to see it.  It really shook me up.;32.9067;-109.853
