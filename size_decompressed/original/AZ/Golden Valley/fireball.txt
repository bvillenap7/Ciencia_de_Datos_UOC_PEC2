Orange Glowing UFO's;2008-07-24 22:00:00;10 minutes;Orange Glowing UFO's Me and two friends were on the back porch and one said look at that. I ran in the house and took a photo. It was very far away and in the southern sky.  The objects moved together and apart several times, up, down,sideways. It would move above the horizon and the up again several times.  One was large, the smaller one was about 10% of the size of the large one.  The image I have attached has been enlarged.;35.3002;-114.2215
