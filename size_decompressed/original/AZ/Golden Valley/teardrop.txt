Military missiles and Jetcraft are evaded by a light in the southern sky.;2012-02-17 21:00:00;22:00;Military missles and Jetcraft are evaded by a light in the southern sky. I was using my telescope and looking south I saw flashes of light, much like lightning, and thought there was a fire or maybe explosions.  Then one of us noticed the light, I pointed my telescope at it and it was a teardrop shape with many colors: blue, yellow, green, red and orange.   It appeared that there were missiles being shot at it, about nine at a time, and the light would evade the missiles and hover again.  There were about five volleys of missiles shot.  There was the sound of jet craft coming from the north.  They were hiding in the mountains so that they could not be seen but we could hear them.  There were three distinct squadrons of jets that went to intercept the craft.  They went by about five minutes apart. Eventually we saw the light start to dodge the jets they had finally appeared some 80 miles, a guess, away.  The light finally went behind the mountains and away from view.   We watched the squadron follow the craft and a few minutes later we saw a cigar shaped light descend from the sky and start to follow the jets to the west until it too disappeared behind the mountains.
