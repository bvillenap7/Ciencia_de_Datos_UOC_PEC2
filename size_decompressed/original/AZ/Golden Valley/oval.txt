Shortly after sitting down,  the motion porch light went out  and the beautiful star filled skies took our breath away.  At that very moment, looking to the west, I saw a large cluster of 6 or 7 lights, each light being comparable to the size of a large star, brackish white in color, shoot across the sky with a trail, at an unbelievable rate of speed  The approximate time was 3 or 4 seconds of travel, then as if a light switch was turned off the lights went completely dark. I could see darkness around each light,  but the lights were close together, like a piece of  Swiss cheese. The object seemed to be at about a 45 degree angle from where I was sitting and traveled from south to north or slightly north east.;35.3002;-114.2215

Facing west. I was looking at the night sky, at a plane moving from west to east. North of the plane appeared a cluster of lights, all being about the same size,close to each other, surrounded by a glow, moving from south to north. It had a trail and was moving at a high rate of speed I watched it for about 3 or 4 seconds before it disappeared. The object moved in a straight line, not loosing altitude.  It was at a 45 degree angle from me in the sky and I was seated.;35.3002;-114.2215
