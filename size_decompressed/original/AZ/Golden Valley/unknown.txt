The object was traveling from the northwest to the southeast of my location much faster than an aircraft yet much slower than an asteroid.   The object did not travel in a straight line, but rather zigged and zagged on occassion sporadically and instantanious.   These were not gradual turns, but rather abrupt.;35.3002;-114.2215
