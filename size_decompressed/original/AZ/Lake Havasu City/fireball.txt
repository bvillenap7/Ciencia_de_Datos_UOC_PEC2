Fireball flies silently by in the night sky;2012-03-30 22:45:00;6 seconds;Fireball flies silently by in the night sky I was in my backyard with my dog about 10:45pm.  I was facing north when a movement in the sky caught my eye.  I saw a large red-orange fireball with a white tail that was attached (did not leave a trail) sailing across the sky, parallel with the ground moving east to west.  It was low enough in the sky for me to determine it was not an airplane or helicopter.  It made absolutely no noise whatsoever. It disappeared from my view (blocked by my house)so I grabbed my dog & ran out front but it was already gone.  I have no clue what it was & there were no reports in the local newspaper.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
UFO's sighted flying in the Lake Havasu City, AZ night sky.;2013-10-15 16:00:00;10 seconds;UFO's sighted flying in the Lake Havasu City, AZ night sky. We saw 5 lights in the sky North of Lake Havasu City, AZ. 4 were stationary while the 5th moved what looked like down and to the right.  The pattern resembled that of a smiley face. The left eye you could say is the light that moved.  They disappeared as quickly as they appeared one at a time.  They appeared again minutes afterwords in a much larger scattered pattern over the horizon disappearing again with no explanation.  2 low flying planes flew over head in a formation that made us assume one was refueling the other. There were also 3 commercial plains flying in the area.  I was able to take a photo of one of the objects before they disappeared.  Sadly, it is only a photo of the last light in the sky.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Fireballs appeared over Lake Havasu City and gradually departed gracefully, lovely to watch.;2013-11-16 20:00:00;15 minutes;Fireballs appeared over Lake Havasu City and gradually departed gracefully, lovely to watch. Slow moving and brilliant fireballs about 4 miles away moved away from Havasu City.   They seemed to appear low and come out of the mountain and spread apart like they were flares floating balloons.   There was no wind and they were moving to fast to be balloons and to bright and big to be flares.   Some faded in and out, disappearing and then reappearing.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Three bright orange balls moving silently at high speed.;2014-01-18 21:00:00;5 minutes;Three bright orange balls moving silently at high speed. 3 bright orange balls, moving at high speed across the sky from the West.  Low flying and silent.  A few nights earlier, we saw 2 huge triangle shaped objects with three large lights in triangle form, and about 8 tiny lights in the center.  They were also low flying and silent and flying in an irregular path, circling a couple of times, then heading toward California.  We tried to record them, but they are really blurry on the video because we only had our cell phones and the quality is not very good.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
