A ring of lesser bright lights towards the bottom 1/3 of the craft. and there were hunderds of small lights from the the top light,and they were in rows to the ring of lights, all were spaced evenly. The cratf wasn't really reflecting the lights off of in becauce I could see all the small lights perfectly. The bottom light shined somewhat of a bright beam of light down, I frist thout it was a rope, like it was tied down, but it was the light. The color was the same as a house light blub, all of the light were like this. The craft was not spinning, just floating moving back forth slowly. It was heading towards the S.W.. I was in my car when this happenedand so was my mom, as soon as we saw it, I went over to a co-workers houes, by this time it was 30,000 ft or more. It was going up at a steady pace. Stopin only a few times. It shot somthing out, like a small flar. By this time it was only a little dot, but was still the brightess thing in the sky.
