Shiny Object Morphs into M Shaped Lights then Vanishes;2011-11-17 18:45:00;1 MINUTE;Shiny Object Morphs into M Shaped Lights then Vanishes While walking to my car after work approx 6:45 pm, I witnessed what I at first thought to be baloons floating by. I could only see the shiny reflection of them as it was dark out already.  It was just above the powerlines from my perspective, so not very high in the sky.  As I watched, it floated by in a very fast, steady & straight direction.  If it were baloons, it should be gaining altitute but it just kept going straight from west to east.  There was no sound whatsoever.  As I continued to watch, it looked as if it tilted onto it's side and morphed into several lights in the shape of an M, then vanished.  I have no clue what it was, but it definately was not baloons.  As soon as it vanished, there were several planes much higher above flying around close together.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Small silver u shaped craft with blue and red lights on top.;2011-11-22 18:00:00;30min;Small silver u shaped craft with blue and red lights on top. I was driving down a residential street at dusk when a orange ball of light came falling down next to a house. I thought I was seeing a meteor until the orange light appeared again and all of a sudden a small silver u shape craft with blue and red lights was traveling roof height a couple of houses in front of me. I thought it was a remote controlled toy until it made a sharp turn to the right and went straight up a few feet. I lost sight until I turned right and noticed it traveling the same height  and next to powerlines. At this point it changed into a ball of white light and slowly proceed up till it appeared to be completely stopped in one place. It was still dusk out and the object appeared brighter then any star. I had pulled over and called a friend and we both observed the object bouncing around in one place for about twenty minuets. Finally it stopped and appeared to get smaller until it looked like a star. I am shook up about it to this day,;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
