Large Shade Spots with no corresponding objects;2008-09-19 07:55:00;5 minutes;Large Shade Spots with no corresponding objects I had turned onto Hwy 40 from HWY 95 headed west.  Cruise control was set at 75 mph. I still had my sunglasses on and noticed some large dark spots on both sides of the highway in the desert.  I thought perhaps there had been some brushfires overnite but did not smell any smoke.  I removed my sunglasses and and could tell it was not spots of brushfire, but rather large shade spots.  All levels of terrain were covered in shade.  There were a minimal number of bands of cumulus clouds in the sky, but not enough to create the huge areas of shade spots in the desert.  There were at least 4 shade areas to the north and two areas to the south.  I called my husband on the cellphone to tell him about the shade spots.  As I was running parallel to one of the large spots, I started counting to try and measure distance.  I counted to fifteen seconds before my view was obstructed by cliffs.  ( I calculate 15 seconds at 75 mph is approximately 1290 feet.)  I exited at the Golden Shores exit. (First exit in western AZ);34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Jets chasing illuminated object;2010-08-30 20:30:00;15 minutes;Jets chasing illuminated object One large object with a dull orangish colored glow.  First being followed by what looked like 2 jets.   A few minutes later 2 more jets joined and now four jets with lots of very bright white blinking lights are all following the glowing object.   All objects were traveling to the south and remained visible until objects were too distant in the night sky.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Orange, Pulsating Lights Near Lake Havasu City;2011-02-14 22:30:00;10 Seconds;Orange, Pulsating Lights Near Lake Havasu City My wife and I were driving East on Hwy-95. I was the first to notice the out of place, orange glowing light outside of the city limits and out towards a large open area in the desert.  It was a clear night, no moon.  I watched the pattern of about 4 lights alternate, each taking turns becoming the brighter light (All orange in color) similar to a Christmas tree light setting.  It was a slow transition.  At first, I thought it was moving like a snake in the sky but now I'm sure it was stationary and on a cycle of some kind, attached to one object - I as we watched, all 4 lights light up brightly and faded.  I watched the sky for a while once I got home and did not see them again.  My friend reported seeing something similar that next day.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Trail of lights where glowing and blinking in patterns of 1 second.;2017-10-05 19:40:00;5 seconds;trail of lights where glowing and blinking in patterns of 1 second. My dad was driving, when a trail of lights where glowing and blinking in patterns of 1 second.   We pulled over and lost sight of them.  There where about 6-7 of them, and they teleport-ed back and forth.   They were red, and round.  They made no shape, just a line in the sky.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
