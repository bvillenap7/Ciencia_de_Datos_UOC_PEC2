I saw 3 lights 1 going about NW  then about 2 min. later 1 going E. and at the same time 1 going N. when you are looking up from Havasu you need to look around and then stop and look at 1 spot to tell if somthing is moving you can see them with out binoculars but you want binoculars once you spot them you can tell that thay are above where planes fly just by judging the lights to the stars. Thay are out I think ever night I have seen them different nights of the week.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Pulsating Lights Make Drops in Arizona;2002-04-01 01:30:00;5 minutes;Pulsating Lights Make Drops in Arizona I should start by saying that I have seen this object 4 times.I will start with the first. The first time I saw this object was in either 1998 or 1999. My boyfriend and I were sitting in a porch swing in front of my house after midnight when I noticed this amber-colored light a few miles away. It was rising vertically in the sky. But what caught my eye the most was that the light was pulsating. It was fading in and out. It was very high in the sky when it became so bright that it looked as if it were going to burst. It then dropped something that looked like shiny gold-colored stuff that sparkled as it fell down. The light then dimmed down until it vanished. Soon after, 2 planes flew over in its direction. My mother later told me that she had also witnessed the light the same night.The second time, I witnessed the same exact thing, in the same exact spot, a few months later by myself. The third time, around March 15th, 2002,my boyfriend and I were driving when we saw the amber light again. This time it was moving above us and only about 5,000 ft in the sky,  probably closer. I stopped my truck and we got out to watch it. There was so much glow around it that I could not make out a shape of the object, let alone,see what it was made out of, and there wasn't any sound coming from it.When the the light stopped quite a few miles away,  again, it became very bright and dropped the same stuff that we saw before. Then the light just disappeared.And again,planes flew over to the area that the object was last in. The last time we saw this object it was around 1:30 in the morning today, April 1st (yeah, just what you need, a sighting on April Fools Day). I met my boyfriend at the track at the high school to go jogging after work. We were walking along when I spotted the amber light. It was moving very slowly and doing the same pulsating stuff. This time, when it became VERY bright, it looked as if it produced a red flare and then dropped it. The red flare-like thing seemed to burn out before it hit the ground. It repeated this once more before it disappeared. I didn't notice any other aircraft flying to the area this time. I really wish I could find out what this is. My boyfriend thinks its a military helicopter test. This would have convinced me if the object would have made some sound when we witnessed it up close. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received many reports of amber lights over Arizona.  Some of them may be military flares, but follow-up investigation is the only way to distinguish flares from bona fide UFO's.  PD));34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Lights in LHC Arizona AGAIN;2002-04-24 01:40:00;5 minutes;Lights in LHC Arizona AGAIN Wow! I saw the light again! This time my boyfriend and I were driving up his street when I spotted the light to the north. I have been carrying my spotting scope with me ever since the last incident on April 1st. So I got the scope out and viewed the light through it. I am not sure if it was because I could not keep the scope very steady, but it looked like the craft was almost.... well, plasma. It dropped a red flare thing just like the last time, but then it dropped some other stuff that was really bright. This time the stuff that it was dropping didn't burn out- it was actually dropping to the ground! Now, the next thing that happened REALLY freaked me out! As I was staring at the light, a second light came from the ground!!!  It floated vertically, and when it got as high as the first light, the first light faded to a dot. Then the second light droppped some bright things, too. But it droppped like 5 things  one after another. All of the stuff it dropped looked like it landed on the ground near some houses!!! (In Lake Havasu City, there are lots of hills and most of the streets are on hills, so if you are on top of a street that is on a good hill,  you can see across to other neighborhoods.)  The first light started to float over to the north more, and went behind the mountains. A few seconds later, the second light did the same thing.  We drove over to where it looked the craft had dropped the things, but didn't find anything. Now I am going to make my boyfriend carry his video camera everywhere we go. Hopefully I will be able to get it on tape this time and send it to you!;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Weird Light fading out then brilliantly bright again.;2004-01-17 20:30:00;About an Hour;Weird Light fading out then brilliantly bright again. I just recently moved to AZ from NH about 3 months ago and am fascinated by the stars I can see here unlike the big city that I came from, the sky at night here is breath taking.  On this particular evening I noticed an extremely bright star.  From all the nights I've been gazing, I've never seen this particular one before.  I was a little stunned at how BIG it was. Big and very very bright! It didn't twinkle, like some of the other stars did and for a brief moment got really spooked.  I ran inside and did an Instant Message to my mother (who is in Nantucket, MA) and told her what I was seeing. She asked if I could take a digital picture of it.  So I attempted to.  I took a picture of the regular stars directly above me, of the little dipper and Orion's belt, but couldn't actually see it through the view finder. I took the picture anyway. I then faced that bright star and actually saw it through my view finder.  That's gotta tell you right there how bright it was. I downloaded it to my computer and it showed up, blurred, as I couldn't keep a steady hand.  I proceeded to try and take several steadier pictures but couldn't.  I concluded that maybe it's the planet Venus but I'm not Astronomically inclined and don't know it's position. I figure I'll check back after an hour or so and see if it moves with the rest of the constellations.  My friend showed up to watch a movie with me but before we did, I pointed it out to him and he was just as baffled.  He said he thought it was too low to be a star. Then thought it was a plane.  But I said it's been stationery like that for the past 1/2 hour or so, it can't be a plane.  We watched the movie and about an hour later (9:30 pm), I stepped back outside to check on it.  It had faded to a smaller redder shape and much lower to the horizon.  Next thing I knew I was holloring for my friend to come see it.  It got extremely bright again, I mean BRIGHT then would fade out then bright again, then fade etc... I asked him if there was a lighthouse around here and he said no.  Then the faded light slowly moved to the right and lit up bright again.  ... It's gone now..... I don't see it anymore.  For a brief description of my point of view.... From my back patio, I see the western sky. I am in the higher part of Lake Havasu City and can see the lake and the Indian Resort Casino in Havasu City, Ca.  I can see the lights of the Casino. These are small pin points of lights and the one I saw had to be about 10 times brighter than the casino lights.  Not being able to estimate miles, All I can do is guess that the bright light I saw was about 5 or 6 miles East of the casino lights which is probably desert.  I am really baffled by this and really want to know what I saw. In the meantime, I'm gonna research Venus's location.  :);34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Bright reddish-orange light southeast of the city phased on and off in an inconsistent north-to-south-to-north again  pattern.;2004-03-24 20:30:00;<1 minute;Bright reddish-orange light southeast of the city phased on and off in an inconsistent north-to-south-to-north again  pattern. Saw a bright, artificial light (relative in terms to the stars) in the sky southeast of the city. On first sighting it turned on for about 3 or 4 seconds, holding, then phased out. Approximately 3 seconds later it flared again, but more to the south, in the same manner as it did before. About 15 seconds later it flared again, but more to the north. The light was orange-red in color. Other aircraft were observed in the vicinity of the light. It should be noted that Nellis AFB is approximately 150 miles to the north, while Luke AFB is about 200 miles to the east. The light was not a shooting star, as it exhibited no like patterns. I don't claim that the object was a UFO or a craft of any type, but it was inconsistent with anything else I've seen, and I've lived in the open West near airforce bases and missile testing facilities nearly all my life. I also make a living based on my ability to observe. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462

My fiancé and I were relaxing on the back patio of his Aunt’s house in Lake Havasu, Arizona, at about 10:30 pm. We were taking a final look at the stars before going to bed, and I noticed a bright red and orange light below the moon.  I pointed it out to my fiancé, and just as he saw it too, another blinked on diagonally above the first, followed by another, forming a small arc of red and orange lights.  They hovered there without movement or sound for about thirty seconds before they all disappeared together.  I ran inside to get my camera, but they never returned.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462

We approached a hill were I told her of a time we had been out there in high school, when all of a sudden more red lights came up from behind the hill flying upwards but in a different direction then the one I had seen previously, i thought i noticed a hint of blue in the rear facing direction of each light.   I could not discern any real shape but was also trying to drive away because we were scared to say the least and they looked less then 100 yards away,   My girlfriend thought the lights resembled a triangular form.

UFO Sighting in Lake Havasu City AZ July 13 2014;2014-07-13 20:13:00;10 minutes;UFO Sighting in Lake Havasu City AZ July 13 2014 On approx 8pm, roommate and friends called me out of the house to come check out a full  half circle rainbow, I grabbed smart phone took two pictures.  Switched phone to video mode (5 mega pixles) and filmed the entire rainbowand noted a strange cluster of clouds, I make the comment it looks as if a UFO could come out of that strange cluster of clouds, I capture that it is about :36 seconds. Here is link to that on YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJBEnAZnFRI&list=UUaKKSNYXQkyNlPH-K6QZjzw   I put phone on standby but still in video mode, and go in to use the bathroom.  Then run back in and yell that I have to come back out and see this it is a UFO,  I turn back on phone, before I go out front door. (Driveway faces South west) As I walk out, I see a very right light up in the sky start record, then watch most of the sighting with my eyes, checking the screen to make sure I had it centered correctly,   What I saw is the light go up, come back down, the strange clouds had disapated, above and below the object, then as it made a slow descent I saw 2 separate lights above a lower disc shaped color of a dark royal blue or purple, almost a blacklight color but brighter.   The 2 light above it which took up 70% of it were very large and bright, with a definate separation of the 2 in the middle. This can be seen on a large screen Hi Def TV. As it decended it slowed, then as it got lower below the power lines and near roof tops it appeared to be miles away South West of town, I mention Sara Park in the video but my direction is off it appears to be 5 to 7 miles south of town in a desert area. no houses or buildings there, As it got to the roof line the left side appeared to me to flash a very bright red light on one sideas it hovered above the roof line a few seconds then dipped below that and went out of site, The other 3 witness's saw it ascend quickly lower, then rise again, that is when I caught this on video here: (1:36)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFiBEyVuY4I&list=UUaKKSNYXQkyNlPH-K6QZjzw    That was it!   My roommate called the non emergency Police line to ask if any calls had come it. And they had not had any but requested to come see the video, roommate said no...lol...  my Father was a Pilot and I have been in many planes before.  This had none of the normal markings of a plane. no tail lights wing lights and the lights were too huge to be landing lights.  We are on the south side of the City, the airport is far north of here and it only went up and down in direction.  My roommate said it rose very quickly high at 1st then kept the same speed shown on video.   It was 8:23pm when it was all done. Thanks for your time.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462

Train of lights crosses big dipper 6 AM Arizona Time  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-23 06:00:00;~ 2-3 minute;Train of lights crosses big dipper 6 AM Arizona Time the perfectly straight line covers most of the sky! I was on my way home from my morning walk and had just made it to the entrance of the parking lot on McCulloch where you would drive right past the entrance to the Library. I looked up to look at the big dipper and saw to my amazement a continuous stream of lights moving from one end of the horizon to the other and passing thru the length of the big dipper. (moving from the cup end to the handle end) While the lights were not evenly spaced, they were all traveling at exactly the same speed with respect to each other. They were all of the same brightness which did not vary. None of them appeared any brighter than any of the stars actually a part of the big dipper. I have no idea how long this had been going on before I saw it. I do know I started watching it no more than a couple of min before six am Arizona time because my phone alarm went off at six am like it always does and I had just started watching the event. I was too amazed to count accur! ately but estimate I saw about 20 to 30 lights. They were in a perfectly straight line but were unevenly spaced. The distance between each light never varied as they moved, but the spacing seemed to vary from 3 degrees to 25 degrees. The train of lights extended from one side of the horizon to the other as much as I can tell. The lights seemed to fade out about 20 degrees past the handle end of the big dipper. I don't know if that was because of clouds or just the city lights of Havasu. My view of the other side of the horizon where they were coming from was obstructed by buildings and trees. When I got back to the condominium where I live I saw a friend who was in the hot tub and asked her if she had seen the same thing and she said she had and that she first noticed it as a group of 4 lights she saw going thru the big dipper and then she noticed the lights just kept coming. I have no accurate account of the duration of this event, but think it lasted no more t! han three min. I am no one in particular, just a 51 year old l! ibrary a ssistant  and former teacher at a private high school. My friend is also a teacher.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462

After a few seconds and realizing this was not normal, ran into the Living Room and had wife open balcony door and we stepped outside where SHE then saw the lights as well.  I pointed out there was no noise and we watched the lights move out over Lake Havasu and disappear.  I commented that if it was a gliding plane we would see a crash as it was not high enough to clear the mountains on the CA side of the lake....no crash and we never saw the lights again. About 15 seconds of viewing, one needed to be either directly under the lights or within 1/4 to 1/2 mile to see the globular source and at a very low altitude.

The sky was clear with no clouds or smoke.   I see what appears to be a satellite traveling from the south to the north.  As I track it, from above it, I see what appears to be a star drop towards the satellite.    As the ball of light intersects with the satellite, the light suddenly stops and then richochets off to the north north west.   The light looks like any other star in the sky but when it dropped it did not have a tail like a normal shooting star it stayed a bright ball of light. I stargaze most mornings and some evenings and am used to seeing satellites, planes, falling stars and other normal sky views.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
