Ground lights up and brings to our attention a huge glowing orange sphere over city.;2007-01-01 21:45:00;5-6 min.;Ground lights up and brings to our attention a huge glowing orange sphere over city. At approx. 21:45 I was greeting my wife outside as she pulled up in the driveway to our house. She turned of the car and shut off the headlights. 10 seconds passed, I was staring at the car when I saw the entire ground light up as if a bolt of lightning had struck within a 500 yard radius. My first thought was that someone was playing with a camera flash nearby because there were no clouds the sky was clear. I looked up and over towards Cassiopeia and spotted a huge glowing orange object. My wife ran over to where I was standing and we watched it flare up and settle into a consistent magnitude. Comparing it to a couple of stars, the object did not appear to move for the first 4 minutes or so. I ran and grabbed my binoculars and upon closer review, the object seemed to be spherical and above a 30,000 foot ceiling. I am assuming this because I could see a slight hint of atmosphere distorting the light. The event lasted approx. 6 minutes. At the end, the light flickered and faded rapidly. It did not look as though it was moving away, but rather that it lost its illumination much like T.V. set turning off in slow motion. From edge out, the light faded inward until only a small dot could be seen. The tiny dot then just disappeared.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Disc Shaped Fire like Object;2007-11-12 19:00:00;4-6 minutes;Disc Shaped Fire like Object The object that my family saw was almost disc shaped but had spherical characteristics to it.   When I first saw it, I thought that maybe it was a contrail.  I looked around a bit more and saw an aircraft approaching it.   I cannot say how far the object was from the UFO, but the object then just disappeared.   Not even 10 seconds later, it appeared miles (again i don't know the distance), from where I last saw it, but still very visual.  It emitted two orb like looking things that came from what I think were the sides, that shot out, and went directly up into the air.   I have absolutely no reason to believe that what I saw was commercial, nor was it military.   Proceeding, there were several what looked like jets scrambling towards it, and away from it.  Possibly around 4 planes in total.   I'm still in utter shock from what I saw.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Orange and Blue orbs....regular visitors.;2011-02-01 09:00:00;1-2 minuets;Orange and Blue orbs....regular visitors. This is a follow up to previous posts from February and March of this year...2011.  I have been getting quite a bit of these orbs around my home the last year and a half.  I had taken these pictures with my Blackberry Pearl and I did not thing they turned out so I did not bother checking.  Well they did!!!  I noticed them on my slide show screensaver...I am uploading what I have. I have regular and also I zoomed them with Paint shop pro.  That is all I have done...I may have messed with the color on one but I do not think I saved it.  Please notice in one of the zoomed shots with two distinct orbs...then I noticed that there is more going on in the shot.  A mother ship maybe or just my crappy camera.  I would love to hear what you all think... I have been obsessed with the study of UFOs for at least 30 years and I think I have finally got some great shots.  Enjoy.

Pre-dawn sighting of 3 blue orbs followed by a 4th;2011-04-14 04:50:00;1-2 minutes;Pre-dawn sighting of 3 blue orbs followed by a 4th Sighting Lake Havasu, April 14, 2011 0450   My eye’s popped open this morning at (according to the clock on my stove) 4:45 am.  I had a glass of milk and headed back to bed when I had a feeling I should go take a look at the sky.  I am a private researcher and have been since the early 70’s.  When I walked outside I was facing NE and I noticed a very bright object coming out of the NW and heading SE, it was fairly low in the sky and I immediately thought it was the ISS.  I grabbed my binoculars and yes after viewing the object I knew from past experience that it was the ISS. It was then I turned to face W and I looked straight up.  Immediately, I noticed another bright object then another, then another.  These objects were glowing blue in color through my binoculars.  They were initially coming from the South and heading North, I followed them maybe 20 degrees in the sky and they all, in formation changed course and headed in an Easterly direction. These objects made no sound and were spaced in a diagonal line, far enough apart that I could only see two at a time in the field of view of my binoculars.  I kept shifting from binocular view to naked eye view to make sure that I was actually seeing three objects.  I continued to watch them as they eventually went out of site. Oddly enough I retrained my view back directly overhead and once again, I saw another object.  This one was also coming from the south and heading north.  This object was also blue and gaging by my view through the binoculars it seemed to be the same but at a higher altitude.  Just as I began to think that this one was a satellite, it began to change its course to follow the three that had just passed overhead. I checked the satellite charts online and the only satellite confirmed at that time was the ISS. These sightings have been occurring on a fairly regular basis here.  The only difference is that I usually see the orange orbs.  I am going to check with the local press to see if there are any other reports to follow.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
1 orange orb, split in 2 then vanished.;2011-06-21 22:00:00;2 seconds;1 orange orb, split in 2 then vanished. Driving south on highway 95 in Lake Havasu City at 10:00pm, saw 1 orange orb, appeared to split into 2 orbs and then both went out after 2 seconds.   There were also fighter jets in the area.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
UFO Caught on Tape January 7th 2012;2012-01-07 20:30:00;45 min;UFO Caught on Tape January 7th 2012 we seen some strange stuff that night...  Too bad we didn't get the mother ship it looked like it was straight out of the movie Close Encounters of the third kind...  The first of the 4 sightings within 1hr started off with a HUGE Mother Ship I guess you could call it.  But by the time we got up into the hills it was gone, we were trying to get up into the area they were headed...  I thought I would call my Son and tell him what we were seeing and see If he wanted to drive up, he lives very close to where we parked in the hills...   And guess what happens.  We get a forth time that these red orbs come flying by but this time we are up in the Remote Area back in the mountains...  My wife and I were very surprised on this 4th sighting not even expecting to see more...  One of the orbs stopped and paused a min before it turned left and flew over the mountains, it looked like it was going to come back and check us out...  I must say we did get a little excited when that! happened... In all I guess there was over 50 as in each group of Orbs there must have been 10 or more red light orbs... There was no way of telling if they all were hooked together but they seemed to be separate orbs... I was lucky enough to catch this even on the third sighting.  I had my cell phone and used it on the third time we seen them.  I never expected to see this a second time much less 4 times in less then a hour... Here is the URL on Youtube where I posted what I caught on tape... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nEk4io9o8o&context=C3a3240aADOEgsToPDskK0XoG5LVYNFWvWbcTqlnJo;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Orange orb in sky silent changed direction but looked the same, disappeared;2012-03-22 20:20:00;3 minutes;Orange orb in sky silent changed direction but looked the same, disappeared My daughter and I were taking a walk in the neighborhood.  The sky is very big here, many stars, very little light pollution.  I noticed an object coming from approximately the southeast traveling west/northwest.  It was orange in color, at first I thought that it was probably a plane, but then I noticed that there was no sound at all, completely silent- it’s very quiet here too! When I studied it further, it looked like the flames in one of those fake fireplaces. My daughter and I watched it for a minute more, I looked down at the ground and when I looked back up it was gone. Completely gone, I saw absolutely no aircraft of any kind anywhere in the visible sky. I had her looking too- she’s seven and has great vision, but she couldn’t find it either. Unfortunately did not have my phone along to take a picture or video!;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462

It moved in the sky much faster than an aircraft could.  I have witnessed similar objects in Lake  Havasu once before but there were three of them.

Bright, moving fast orange sphere over Lake Havasu City.;2016-01-12 20:30:00;3 minutes;Bright, moving fast orange sphere over Lake Havasu City At 20:30 we let the dogs out to go to the bathroom.  In the sky above us we noticed a large orange sphere traveling from North to south east.   After viewing for three minutes it fast disappeared.  My wife tried to take a moving picture with her phone and was right on it, after she tried to play it back and there was no picture at all, just one flash and nothing.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
