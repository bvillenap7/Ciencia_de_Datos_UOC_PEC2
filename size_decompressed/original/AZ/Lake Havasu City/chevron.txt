4 to 6 shiny objects approached close to Lake Havasu City, AZ.;2013-11-30 11:35:00;5 minutes;4 to 6 shiny objects approached close to Lake Havasu City, AZ. I was walking my dog on the Island and I was looking to the S.W. over the mountains and the sun reflected on several objects that were low in the sky but very hard to see.  They seemed to have a shape similar to a glider parachute.   The first time I seen them they were heading toward Lake Havasu there were 4 to 6 of them in formation about 10 miles away from me.  They were very stealth (hard to detect) the second time I seen them about 10 miles away from me they turned away 180* and the sun reflected on them, again exposing them and they headed out toward the Heart of the Mojave Desert.   There was no other aircraft in the sky.  Very sunny day 72* with blue sky and no clouds.  The objects made no jet type of noise and left no exhaust (contrails).   They were flying in an area were there wasn't any people and I assume they got close enough to LHC, AZ.   So, rather then risk being spotted they turned around.   I keep in mind that were within several hundred air miles from Area 51.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
