At exactly 9 pm (21:00 hrs) I was walking my friend out to his truck. It was a clear sky and the stars were very bright. I noticed a somewhat dim, amber light come into view. I have seen a hundred satellites in our desert sky. This was not a satellite. I am an amature astronomer as well and I understand the differences between objects within our atmosphere and those that are traveling out of it.  I saw the space station through my 12” Orion telescope this summer for 10 seconds along with the space shuttle with my own eyes (eye). This object was within our atmosphere and I would guess it to be about 20,000 to 30,000 feet in altitude. It was traveling comparatively, twice the visible speed as an average commercial airliner making it about 1200-1400 miles per hour. The object was a very elongated, narrow oval. It was traveling from East to West and was straight above my house when it came into view. The entire object glowed in a mildly bright, consistent amber color. There were no other lights on the craft. The light emitted was not flashing or blinking. I ran in to grab my binoculars and went out my back door which faces west to try and catch an up close glimpse. I was not successful. The object was gone from sight within 10 seconds. There were many other easily identifiable aircraft in the sky for the next 20 minutes flying with in 50 miles or so of the area of the craft’s path.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Bright white/oval traveling at high rate of speed.;2012-04-14 21:15:00;5 seconds;bright white/oval traveling at high rate of speed While walking our dog, I observed a bright white, oval object traveling at a high rate of speed coming from the north heading to the south.  I watched it for about three seconds and told my girlfriend to look and she turned and observed it, too, for a couple of seconds before it disappeared.  The object appeared to be at least 4 times the size of Jupiter. I was walking the dog with my boyfriend and he told me to look at that pointing to the left in the sky. I saw a big, bright white sphere with a small trail of white going down from left to right. It was bigger than any of the planets in the sky and took a couple of seconds, much longer than any shooting star or meteor I have ever seen, before it disappeared.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
