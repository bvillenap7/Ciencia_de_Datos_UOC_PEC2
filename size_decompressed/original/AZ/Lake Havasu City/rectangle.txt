A large, low flying object flew over our heads in complete silence.;2006-09-15 21:00:00;40 seconds;A large, low flying object flew over our heads in complete silence. My friends and I were sitting on the pool deck in the back yard of their families house in the center of a neighborhood in Havasu City.  My back was facing their house and my two friends were sitting facing me.   We had been sitting for approx. 15 minutes when they abruptly stopped talking and before I could ask why, I looked up and saw an object approx.100 feet across move over my head.  It was absolutely silent and was moving at an altitude of approx. 50 to 100 feet above our heads.  The only light associated with the object was a very fuzzy glow around the perimeter of the object. Because it was poorly lit, I cannot say the exact shape of the object but it appeared rectangular.   Gaging by the time it took to disappear into the distance, I would estimate the objects speed to be approx. 50 m.p.h..   What I saw differed from my friends, since they saw it as it approached.  They described the large object approaching at a higher altitude and then abruptly dropping to the altitude in which it passed over head.   I had never seen anything like this before despite the fact that I have flow as an airline pilot for over 20 years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
