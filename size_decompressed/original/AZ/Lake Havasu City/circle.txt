Bright, large object in early morning desert sky Thursday morning.;2007-10-24 06:15:00;15 minutes;Bright, large object in early morning desert sky Thursday morning. 6:20 am Thursday morning, the 24th of October. I was standing in our companyâ€™s break room talking to another co-worker when a third co-worker opened the door and told us there was a strange object/light hovering near and above the south side of town.  Having some experience with a few sightings before (because my eyes never leave the sky) I ran out and immediately began to compare its movement with a nearby by airliner, houses and trees.  According to my co-worker, the object/light started out as being as large as his fingernail.  It moved slowly upward, silently.   By the time he arrived at work and I had gotten outside to see it and it was half the luminosity of Venus which was shining in the predawn light also in the southern sky.  The light from the object began to pulsate and the object began to move in a tight circular pattern.   A commercial airliner began to approach the area from a westerly direction at what I can assume to be a 30,000 foot ceiling.  As the airliner came closer, the object moved sporadically in a straight line heading south, quickly the light flickered and dissipated and finally shot away.  30 minutes later while we were talking about it in the office, a third witness told us that she saw the same object from a different angle. She said that she saw two smaller objects eject or shoot out from the bottom of the main craft.  She pulled her daughter outside to watch. 20 minutes after the craft shot away, the sky was a full military aircraft scrambled in multiple directions and all in the basic area where the object was hovering.  A person in our group familiar with Air Force maneuvers mentioned that those aircraft were moving in a scout formation.   We are all familiar with the regular air traffic patterns from L.A., Vegas and Phoenix. None of these six or so aircraft followed those usual patterns. They were all at nearly the same altitude and flying in many different directions.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462

What are these bright orange orbs in the sky here over Lake Havasu City, AZ????;2013-01-31 22:30:00;15 minutes;What are these bright orange orbs in the sky here over Lake Havasu City, AZ???? We saw four object, orange in color spaced out evenly coming across the lake.  Then there were two more coming from the west spaced out in the same way.  We looked to the east and there were two more of these objects.  They are a bright orange color, and only stay lit for about 5-10 minutes and then just suddenly go out.  Tonight is a full moon and we are wondering if that has any relation to these objects as we have now seen them for about the last three months.  No one is reporting this on our news, paper or radio and we want to know what these things are!;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Bright Fireball got lower to ground and dimmer until it eventually just faded out.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD));2013-11-28 19:45:00;1 hour;Bright Fireball got lower to ground and dimmer until it eventually just faded out. It looked like a fireball - Extremely bright you could see it change colors almost like it was so bright that you could see the color spectrum illuminated from it.   We stood outside and watched for nearly 30 minutes  (My grandmother had been outside for a while before)  It was very slowly getting lower, and lower.  It was almost unnoticeable except for that it escaped behind the house in front of our view and we  had to move in order to see it again.  It seemed to be slowly getting lower and as it lowered it seemed to dim.  EVERY DOG COYOTE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WENT CRAZY.  I hear coyote's often, but they were everywhere it seemed like every dog started barking.  We watched it go from so bright it was hard to focus on, it looked like someone was dimming a light until it was just gone.  As it was dimming it almost looked like it was trying to mimic the colors of the stars, (changing and shifting, and then it would stay the same for a minute or two and then change again) until it just went away,  It just faded out.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
UFO over Lake Havasu City, Arizona, at around 19:57 Pacific time.;2014-07-13 19:57:00;90 seconds;UFO over Lake Havasu City, Arizona at around 19:57 Pacific time. We were filming a magnificent rainbow, and shortly afterward, a craft appeared.  I saw a red light, which then transferred into a clear larger round shape.  It was as it the object was moving forword towards me.  I heard the neighbors talking about it too, each of us wondering what it could be (Military? Drone?) --we are, afterall in Arizona's desert where a lot of military goes unnoticed. At any rate, the craft hung there, not moving at all.  Suddenly, it shot up into the air, and then, it descended behind the houses so we wouldn't see it.  We go in the car and tried to find it, seeing only a ball of light on a hillside.  We were unsuccessful in reaching it, and when we tried, it disappeared.  We came home and turned on the PD scanner and heard a call about a ball of light on the hillside.   We have the video uploading to YouTube and have called the news station, and we will send you the footage.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
