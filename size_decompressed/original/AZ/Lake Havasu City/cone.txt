red cone shape with orange base low flying no noise flight east to west the west to north over Lake Havasu AZ;2000-08-05 21:43:00;15 minutes;red cone shape with orange base low flying no noise flight east to west the west to north over Lake Havasu AZ I was finnishing watching a movie when I looked out my front room windows and saw a red dot comming from the east my windows face the west. My son,13, and I went out and looked at it and it made no noise but was low in the sky which is unusual as the air space above the lake is military air space and all commercial traffic is restricted to very very high altitude. As we watch the is nosieless red dot make a 90 degree turn to the north on the California side of the lake I went in to get my binoculars and came out and rested my elbows on my truck and could see this was a red cone with the point on the top with a redish orange below it. I followed it with binoculars until it became a red dot through them and came in to report this event to you. The sky was cloudless and no wind temp was around 100 degrees.
