Silver ufo dics observed from Lake Havasu City in broad light.;2005-05-15 13:00:00;30 minutes;Silver ufo dics observed from Lake Havasu city in broad light. I went out side on a mid afternoon and something caught my eye in the sky in full daylight with not a cloud in the sky at all, lake havasu city is an extremely sunny clear city. I looked over the Lake and I observed a bright gleaming silver disc across the lake and over a place called havasu landing.  It was probably about 25 miles away from me and probably mile up in the sky.  The craft moved at right angles at lightening fast speeds, it would also sit still then instantly appear at least 10 miles across on the other side of the sky as fast as I could bling. I would estimate the craft to be 30 feet in disc shape length and probably 10 feet tall. I went inside to get my roomates and they observed the object with me and it was nothing we have ever seen before.  This area we saw the craft was either over california or nevada near the borders, we are 2 hours from las Vegas.  I observed the craft for easily 30 straight minutes.  I know what I saw is extra or intra dimension technology whether it was ours or not.  It was a classic silver disc.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462

THEN IT WAS GONE. ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER IT APPEARED AGAIN ABOUT 500 YARDS TO THE RIGHT AND A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN THE FIRST SIGHTING,IT STAYED THERE FOR ABOUT 30 TO 40 SECONDS AND THEN JUST DISAPPEARED.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Flying saucer over Lake Havasu Arizona;2009-07-04 17:00:00;20 minutes;Flying saucer over Lake Havasu,  Arizona. A large dark disc almost pizza shaped with a small center point.  At first it appeared in the high in the sky NW of Havasu, as the winds blew due West the craft continued slowly due east.  Time approximately 5:00 PM. Within minutes the craft then began to rotate as on a gimble, the appearance went from a round disk to a very thin profile with a small round dome above and below the profile.  Flying saucer style.  The craft continued to change position so that the view went from perfectly round to thin and flat almost invisable in the sky. For over 15 minutes we watched the craft move just a few feet across the sky line from our view (over 100 miles as the crow flies).  I went in the house to set up the telescope and in less than 5 minutes it was totally gone from site.  Sky's were partly cloudy with clear line of sight to the East where the craft seemed to be floating, but nothing in site. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Bright Amber Disk - Travels Across The Desert Sky;2011-03-10 07:46:00;3 Minutes;Bright Amber Disk - Travels Across The Desert Sky Thursday night at approximately 7:46 PM, I spotted a brilliant amber light in the North/ Western sky. I was sitting, facing East and the California side of the horizon from my home in Arizona.  I am very, very familiar with the flight patterns from L.A. to Phoenix and back.  Those travel East to West and visa versa and only shift latterly North and South depending on weather and other circumstances.  I'll say that I see A LOT of interesting things in the sky and often around here.  This one was absolutely amazing.  Once I realized it was not a plane, I thought it could be the space shuttle.  That had landed the day before so that was out.  I then reasoned that it was the Mir.  I ran and grabbed my binoculars to confirm. Not so much.  I've seen the Mir 3 times in the last 5 years - Once with my naked eye at about the same time at night, once through my 12 dobby telescope and one other time just after dusk with my naked eye.  This was not the Mir to the best of my know! ledge.  It glowed more brightly than any star in the sky.  It was a distinct orange glow which looks similar to reflected light from the Shuttle and Mir but through my binoculars, the light was steady, unwavering and stayed the same luminosity across the entire night sky.  It travelled at approximately 1400 mph.  I am basing that on what I have watched hundreds of times, commercial airliners traveling at anywhere from 600 to 700 mph.  I could not tell altitude beyond about 30,000 feet.  Through the binoculars, I could not make out any formation of wings, additional lights/strobes or physical features.  To me, it looked exactly like a brightly glowing disk since the light was not round.  It was very slightly oval.  There was no atmospheric disruption that I could see.  There was no propulsion or exhaust that I could see - Just a very bright and very steady moving object traveling from North to South in the clean night sky.  The moon was visible but only a quarter-moon washed out the stars.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Saucer shaped ufo with 7 or 8 very bright lights seen south of Lake Havasu City, AZ;2012-08-02 03:30:00;30 seconds;saucer shaped ufo with 7 or 8 very bright lights seen south of Lake Havasu City, AZ As i woke up to get a drink of water at approximately 3:30am on tuesday August 2nd 2012, I noticed my dog was staring out the window and growling.  I stepped outside to investigate and what I witnessed was unlike anything I had ever seen before. About 10 miles south of Lake Havasu City AZ I saw a very large UFO about the size of a city or maybe bigger, it was gigantic.  The saucer shaped object appeared to be a silver or chrome plated color glistening in the moonlight.   The object was hovering motionless in the air with seven or eight very bright flickering white lights attached in a circle around it. relative to a star, each light appeared to be about the size of the moon however the lights were not in space.  The UFO also had a plasma like coating around it and was completely silent. This event only lasted a duration of about thirty seconds or so.   I rushed into my house to find a camera but by the time I got back outside, the lights had become very dim and faded away. The craft was so advanced in technology, it was like seeing something out of a sci-fi movie. I believe it may have camouflage capabilities and other unknown abilities.  Whatever this was that I witnessed, I believe it is either from the future or a spaceship not from planet earth.   I hope my sighting will be taken seriously. I am afraid for my life and would like to find some answers to this unexplained mystery.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
Object flying in the cold jet stream air and not leaving a vapor trail from it's hot exhaust like other jets were leaving!;2013-11-13 17:35:00;5 minute;Object flying in the cold jet stream air and not leaving a vapor trail from it's hot exhaust like other jets were leaving! Peter, 6 of us were watching the sunset at 17:35 on 11/13/13 my wife pointed out to me and said there's another one of those things like we seen last year!  It was a shiny disc/wing object flying over Lake Havasu from the S.E. traveling toward the West.  The Sun had not set but it disappeared behind the Western desert mountains.  The object was flying in the jet stream 35,000 to 40,000 feet in elevation.  One of the six people said it's just a jetliner (Lake Havasu is in a fly over pattern for aircraft flying to and from Phoenix, AZ. to L.A. and S.F.) I quickly quipped if that object is an aircraft why isn't leaving a contrail (hot white exhaust smoke hitting the cold air) like the other jets (there was four other aircraft in the area all four flying to the West as the object was) and why doesn't this object have strobe lights on like the other four aircraft in the area.  Another comment was maybe it's a star and I quickly pointed out the planet Venus, which was ! visible in the West and told them that Venus was the brightest light in the night sky for a star or planet and this object was 3 times brighter than Venus.  Another quipped it's just one of those U.S. Marine Fighter Jets going on a bombing run out in the Mojave Desert.  I am very familiar with the Marine Air Wing out of Yuma, AZ. (I'm a Ex Marine) and there flying F-35B and I've observed that they stay out of the commerical aircraft space when flying out on there bombing runs.  They fly half that distance in height and they always have just white strobe lights on.  Plus these objects were much larger than a fighter jet.  Someone else quipped it must be something out of Area 51 which is about 200 miles N.W. of us.  15 minutes later a second object flew over in the same flight path as the first.  The only difference in this aircraft from the prior one was it was more of a orange color that I assume was coming from the sunset.  I would like to note that I seen the same type object last year (I didn't report it until now) as it was flying behind and! overtook and flew between 2 jet airliners that were flying beside each other with or about 3 miles in between the 2 jetliners.  And again this aircraft didn't leave a contrail like the other two jets were leaving!  My wife and I witnessed both these sightings this year and last. I can't explain what I was seeing.;34.4642398601398;-114.234361538462
