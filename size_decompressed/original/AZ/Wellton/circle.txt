Orange orb with huge waves of air below and above it.;2017-09-26 23:10:00;1 minute;Orange orb with huge waves of air below and above it. We were stargazing outside of Yuma, Arizona, when an orange orb heading South shot through the sky as we were facing West.  The strange part was the huge arching air streams coming from the top and the bottom of the orb.  Nothing directly behind the object like a jet would have a contrail, but more like waves of air flowing over and under it.   After sighting it in my binoculars, it just disappeared.;32.6935;-114.1561
