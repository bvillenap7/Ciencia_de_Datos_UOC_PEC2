Formation of bright orange lights appearing and disappearing over AZ desert.;2016-02-17 19:30:00;45 minutes;Formation of bright orange lights appearing and disappearing over AZ desert I observed and pointed out two strange orange lights to my partner, while driving west on interstate 8.  They were hovering very still in the direction of the Mexican border, southwest of us.   While watching for several minutes, we saw a white explosion/light coming from the ground below the orange lights, then what looked like a bright fireball between the two orange lights, then one more white flash from the ground, before the two orange lights disappeared one by one.   Then after about 15 minutes of driving, we saw a set of four other orange lights in the sky appear one by one.   We watched these lights for about 20+ min, before they, too, disappeared one by one.  The last set of four lights seemed to be in a formation, three in the back one in the front;32.6935;-114.1561
