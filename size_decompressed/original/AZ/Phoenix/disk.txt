Saucer and tall alien who appeared in human form;1972-08-01 15:00:00;1:00;Saucer and tall alien who appeared in human form I silver white disk/saucer approx 35 feet high and 45 feet wide., out side the craft stood a very tall lean male.  He appeared to be 7', wearing a silver/grey military type uniform.  He said, return to your home, do not come back out til morning.  He communicated with his mind.  I returned to my home.  I could hear sirens coming to the location where the saucer and man stood. This male appeared as a male not unlike that of a human, he was firm in his request and compelling, though he did not present himself as threatening.  There was no report on the news of this sighting.   Two to three hours later the police did come to our door and asked my mother to keep all of us indoors that night.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Saucer sighting in 1970s near Phoenix, AZ.;1975-01-01 12:00:00;5 minutes;Saucer sighting in 1970s near Phoenix, AZ. Sometime in the mid-70s, I was driving from Williams AFB toward Apache Junction.  The day was clear and cloudless.  I saw a saucer-shaped object rise out of the desert in front of me and slowly ascend into the air, straight up, until it was out of sight. At the time, I tried to guess the size of the object and estimated that it was at least as large as a high school football stadium.  It was a dull silver color and looked like the flying saucers in old sci-fi movies.  There was absolutely no sound associated with this sighting. I thought I would see something about this in the newspaper, but did not.  I was so astounded by what I saw and thought surely someone else would report it, as I could not possibly have been the only one to see it.  I did not tell anyone for years, thinking people would think I was a nut.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
viewed saucer manuveurs and air force search for extended period of time from close range;1976-06-25 22:00:00;1 1/2 hrs.;viewed saucer manuveurs and air force search for extended period of time from close range My friend and I were attending a drive-in movie in central Phoenix, AZ around the bicentennial time. We saw a disk-shaped object come quite close to us. It was noiseless and hovered off to my left (I was on the passenger side of the car). At one point it started to descend and that is when the shape became apparent. It had a row of very bright white lights that revolved (or the ship did, this was unclear) which it turned on an off a few times. There was a (either blue or green, I believe green) stationary light on the top which stayed on at all times. After descending it went back to approximately its original position.This viewing lasted around 15-20 minutes. Then the craft moved off to the south very fast and stopped. I could only see the lights at this point. An air force jet came from west toward the craft and turned and went back. Then a jet came from the east and did the same. The two more jets came from other sides, one at a time, and turned away. Then a jet came from the west side again only it came closer to the craft than the others had. Immediately the craft moved incredibly fast to the east side of Phoenix. The jet followed, at a slower speed. Then the craft turned to the south slowly with the jet in pursuit. At this point all the white lights on the craft went out. Immediately the lights on the jet went out. They moved to the south . I could only see the blinking of the light on the top of the craft. When they got to south Phoenix the craft was no longer visible to me. I believe the jets lost it also. For the remainder of the movie (which was around 2 hours long the jets combed the south area. The sky was clear. The weather nice. I am bad with measurements but I believe the craft was about two blocks away and approximately 100 feet in diameter. The craft could hover, move incredibly fast, was noiseless, revolved (I believe), and the white lights were very bright. I am unsure of the color of the object as the lights were very bright but it also didn't seem to have a color as such. My friend saw it and was afraid it was going to land and didn't watch much of it. At one point I got out of the car to not only get a better look but hoped to attract attention to it. I mentioned to a couple in the next car but they did not seem interested. There were no reports in the paper or news. I did hear of a man (through friends) who saw it also across town but did not know him or get a name. I was 19 years old at the time and did not know the correct way to report this. Also my memory has faded to exact date and color of light on top of craft. But the rest is quite clear. I remember the movie name and hoped to check the running dates for the movie but I am sure the drive-in is closed by now. I am interested in finding more information about this sighting, if possible. I cannot be contacted collect by phone, as I do not have long distance service but would appreciate any info on this.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Phoenix, AZ, mid-July, 1976, 11:30 am, shiny silver disk- shaped object hovering over vacant lot at about 200'.;1976-07-10 11:30:00;6 secs.;Phoenix, AZ, mid-July, 1976, 11:30 am, shiny silver disk- shaped object hovering over vacant lot at about 200'. Driving on Interstate 10, downtown Phoenix, on an overpass in the middle of the business district of the city.  My father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, my niece in the back driver's side, and I in the right back passenger side of the car. The object was in a position of about 1 o'clock (To my right, SW), hovering at about 200', over a vacant corner lot, on a busy city street, in the midst of tall office buildings.  It's altitude was below some of the tallest buildings, so that it should have been seen by anyone looking in that direction, either from the ground level or out of any of the buildings' windows.  It must have been casting a shadow directly beneath. It was a highly polished, aluminum-looking disc-shaped craft, round, about the size of a third of a city block (it covered the entire vacant lot).  The best way to describe it would be that it had the appearance and proportions of a fat silver dollar with rounded edges, but absolutely smooth.  There were no extraneous antennas, wings, tail, propellers, insignia, doors, windows, etc..  It hovered motionless, without sound that I could hear (my window was open). I watched it for about 6 seconds, thinking, Oh, there's one now.  In other words, I was very calm.  There was no question in my mind that this was an extraterrestrial craft. I turned my attention to the interior of the car and asked my family, What's that?!  Unfortunately, at that exact moment, a small private plane was buzzing the freeway, very low, right in front of us, from right to left (from the direction of the craft).  Everyone in the car said, It's a plane.  I said, No, not that!  That! and as I turned to point to the object, it was gone.  No one else in our car saw it.  I do believe that the people in the small plane came close enough to call it a near miss.  Maybe that was why they were so low over the freeway they had spotted it and came down for a closer look. Since it had just disappeared, or had taken off straight up (the only two possibilities, considering the close quarters it was in amongst the tall buildings), I looked up and down in every direction (as much as possible from the back seat of a car) for miles.  The sky was absolutely clear with only one small cloud to obscure any view.  I watched this cloud dissipate, as they do in the desert, trying to see if maybe the object had flown into it.  One can see for miles in the flat desert around Phoenix, and I could not spot it anywhere. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

We had heard a light buzzing sound and turned around to see a craft with orangeish colored lights, hovering less than 20 yards from us.  That is all any of the three of us remember and in fact we didn't talk about it for almost ten years, like it had been teporarily erased from our memories, until one night when someone brought up UFO's and the three of us spoke up about our experience.  How could someone put something like that into the back of their brains.  After talking about it for awhile, none of us recalled the craft leaving and we believe that we may have lost some time.

Seriously Close Encounter!!!!!!;1999-06-12 02:30:00;13 minutes;Seriously Close Encounter!!!!!! Myself and my two roommates were sitting on our front porch, when I saw what i thought was a star at first.  It started swaying back and forth from side to side slowly.  As it got closer to the ground it quit swaying, and my roommates noticed what ever it was flying directly towards us from straight ahead of us but up in the sky.  As it got close enough for us to hear the flying craft, we could hear a high pitch turbine engine sound radiating from the craft that came to a complete stop above my neighbors house in the middle of the night.  My roommates and I all stood and I asked if they saw that thing too.  They said yes.   The craft was obviously as interested in us as we were of it.  I looked around at my other neighbors houses to see if anybody was coming out to see what this loud noise was coming from this craft now hovering motionless above my neighbors house.  Nobody came out.  We all three started walking to our driveway and out to the street.  As we did that ,th! e craft became silent and I could not hear any noise.  We all three kept our eyes glued to the mysterious craft that just floated down from the dark sky.  As we walked towards the street , the craft came towards us but parallel so that we didn't end up directly underneath it when we met in the middle of the street.  The craft then hovered silently about 15 feet above us and ten feet away so weren't directly underneath it.  We all three staired at the hovering craft for what seems like a long time and I felt tired, but only about 13 min passed.  All three of us seemed to be in a trance like state staring at the craft as it started to float silently away from us down our street at the same altitude it was checking us out at.  Whoever was piloting the craft that was about half as big as my neighbors house, that it first hovered over, was just as curious about us as we were about this craft.  We watched it float away down our street after what felt like hours, but almost no time had! passed.  The craft made it about 3/4 of the way down the street and then made a degree of a turn over 90° smooth fluidly and effortlessly back towards where it originally flew down from up with all the stars.  It flew as effortlessly and slow going back up that it did coming down.  Except it flew in more of a straight pattern going back up.  When it was to small to distinguish the craft from a star I blinked and looked around my street ,sighing when I realized nobody was watching us.  Then I noticed my roommates were still in a trance staring at the sky in the middle of our street at 2:30 in the morning.  Then I said hey guys let's get out of the street before someone thinks we're crazy or something.  The craft did not have bright lights emanating from the bottom, but it did have some lights flashing colors in the fusilage area that sat in the middle of the saucer craft.  I have never seen or experienced this kind of thing before or after in my entire life.  As the craft was flying away slowly like it didn't have a care in the world, I thought to myself how insignificant we really are and those things can do what they want and we probly can't stop them.  When then craft was observing us close I could have hit it with a rock it was so close.  The air had a strange smell also while it was close. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

They were each four to five inches in size from where I stood.  The domed top was clear on all the craft. They were moving from south to north in a diamond formation. Each swayed back and forth and traded places, still maintaining the diamond formation as they collectively traveled forward to the north.

At  14:56 two witness were out getting groceries out of car.  Looked up East from our back alley (live in Condo) observed very bright white round object high in blue sky going very fast in Easterly direction toward moon which was also visible. They said it passed in front of moon and dissapeared behind the trees.  Clear day, no wind, no sound,flying faster than plane or other flying known object would travel and still  be visible. We live 1 block sourth of 47th Ave and Thomas. The witness are a 16yr old female  and a grandmother.  No drinking, or drugs in background.  A good student at high school and the Grandmother is well educated and very able to tell the difference between flying objects having lived through the WWII and being an observer of aircraft relating to that period. We live in a frequent flight path of Airplanes going to and from Sky Harbor International Airport.  This was not a known plane of any type that we are aware of. Student did state that it was so brilliantly white that she thought it was a piece of paper blowing swifly by the wind. Grandmoter looked and said no it was going to straight and sure to be blown.  They believe that it was a disk or soemthing round like that, that flew swiftly out of sight going East. Also there was no wind at ground level that could account for this. Grandmother did state that she thought it was pretty high up in the sky.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

As I drove east on Hatcher Road to my home on 19th Street (last street on the mountain) I saw a bright object that looked somewhat like a Goodyear blimp, but it was covered with lights...multi-colored lights.   And it seemed to be traveling at a faster speed than a blimp.  It was about 3 blocks away at about 200' in the air.  I thought it was going to land on the roof of my home, but it continued in a northeast direction across the mountain.  The area is in the Dreamy Draw area of northeast Phoenix.  I am 5a 56 year old grandmother of 12 and have never witnessed anything like this before.  I immediately called Phoenix Police Department to report what I had seen.  They directed me to call Sky Harbor Airport.  Sky Harbor said there were no blimps in the area and directed me to call UFO reportings at a 480 area code number.  I have been trying to find out all day what this could be.  I am curious. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for the same area for July 23rd and 24th.

Then one by one two more appeared right of the the Big Dipper (no west/east travel) and all four started traveling east. They were in a staggered flying formation but yet consistent and they glided east. We watched them for a minute or two as they disappeared out of our sight.

Dozen or so white spinning discs flying erractly over Central Phoenix;2004-06-15 12:00:00;10 mins;Dozen or so white spinning discs flying erractly over Central Phoenix I originally wrote this all out the day I witnessed this so that I wouldn't forget the details and just found this site & decided to copy & paste it here because I'm curious if anyone else has seen this besides us.  Around 12 noon on 6/15/04, I was looking out the side of my parking garage at work (at Thomas Rd & Central Ave, facing North/Northwest in Phoenix) and saw something very strange in the sky. There were about a dozen white/silver small discs flying sporadically in the sky. I tried to count them, but they were constantly in errantic motion & I found it hard. I turned to a girl (who I don't know, but works in my building) who was near me in the parking garage. She was talking on her cellphone & apologized for interrupting her conversation in fear of her thinking I was nuts, but I had to ask if she could see what I'm seeing?? (I was so glad I wasn't the only one out there)She said into the phone, Honey, where are you? There are weird things flying around in the sky out here.....yeah, right now!. We laughed, but didn't take our eyes off of the show. They seemed silverish & turned really bright white (seeming to reflect the sun)  sometimes when they dipped & flew in certain ways. You could definately see that they had a spinning motion also & they were all moving at different speeds, up, down, left, right, looping, diagonally, you name it. They were definately NOT flying in unison, but they were all grouped together, a few were a little North of me, moving behind buildings & back again, but most were NW. An airplane was ascending from Sky Harbor Airport too at that time & flew right past them (plane was flying North/ Northwest). I was wondering if those people were looking out the window & could they see them?? At first I thought maybe they were pieces of paper that got caught in the wind or something, but they were much bigger than that...and SPINNING. They didn't look like balloons, helicopters or planes of any kind as far as I could tell. Neither did they look (or fly) like birds. We stood & watched them for about 10 minutes, when they all started going North at the same time until I couldn't see them anymore. I've never seen anything like it. I am curious to know if anyone else caught the show? Someone here at work suggested I write to the newspaper to see, so I wrote that day, no response (shocker!) If anyone has seen similar, please post. Thanks so much.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Taking photos of an approaching severe thunderstorm and scud clouds in Phoenix Arizona;2007-07-31 19:00:00;2 minutes;Taking photos of an approaching severe thunderstorm and scud clouds in Phoenix Arizona Heading east on Thunderbird road between Cave creek rd. and 32nd st. in Phoenix Arizona, I couldn't resist stopping and taking a few photos of an approaching Severe Thunderstorm just east of my location. Off to my left I noticed a disk shaped object moving very erratic from North to South just ahead of the gust front generated by the thunderstorm. I at first thought maybe it was a balloon or other debris but that couldn't be the case because this storm was moving basically to the West directly at me, and very slowly ! So any objects would have been heading straight towards me. This disk shaped object moving North to South was traveling very slowly, almost as if it were sightseeing. Lightning was very intense just east of my location so that ruled out any helicopters or private planes in the same area. That disk shaped object was much to low as seen in the photo to be commercial airliner, Sky Harbor international airport in Phoenix was almost 25 miles away. Shortly after this photo was taken it traveled slightly more to the south and lifted almost verticle into the scud clouds and never did reappear.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Disk Shaped (Domed Saucer shape, with multicolored, animated lights around rim);2011-08-13 21:15:00;15-20 seconds;Phoenix, Arizona 13 August 2011 Approximately 9:15 pm PDT (GMT -7)  Disk Shaped (Domed Saucer shape, with multicolored, animated lights around rim)  At approximately 9:15 pm local time, two individuals traveling southbound on the SR-51 Parkway, (South of Greenway, North of Cactus) became aware of a large, domed, saucer shaped object, above the freeway. The object appeared to be a solid “craft” or aerial vehicle of unknown type. (as opposed to just a set of lights in the sky)  Duration of the sighting was brief, approximately 15 seconds, during which time the object performed various maneuvers, and displayed very unusual lights. When first spotted, by the passenger (Right, front seat) the saucer shaped object was hovering, or flying very slowly, with it's circular plane horizontal, or parallel to the ground.  It then tilted, or rotated towards the cars on the freeway, whereupon a single blue and red light (spaced closely together on the forward facing rim) illuminated, and then began “propagating” around the rim, in opposite directions. (Blue lights, clockwise, Red lights, counter-clockwise)  At the same time, it became apparent, the saucer shaped object was domed on it's upper surface.  Also, at the same time, the entire object, or craft was observed to rotate counter clockwise, while the lights around it's rim, remained stationary. The object then began moving north, towards the observer's car, and vanished from sight.  The two witnesses left the freeway at the next exit (Cactus Road) pulling over as soon as possible to try to spot the object again.  While doing this, they observed another couple, apparently doing the same thing. The driver of the witness car produced the attached drawing.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

AT FIRST I DIDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS WITNESSING UNTIL I SAT DOWN AND WATCHED THIS THING FOR THE NEXT 40-45 MINS. IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ME TO TELL THE SHAPE OF IT BY LOOKING AT THE WHITE LIGHTS THAT WAS FLASHING AROUND THE RIM OF IT.  WE HAD JUST HAD A SIGHTING ON THURS. 9/13/12 BY MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN ARIZONA. THE GOV. IS TRYING TO SAY THAT IT WAS SOME KIND OF LIGHT FROM AN EXPLOSION.. IF THOSE PEOPLE WITNESSED THE SAME THING THAT I HAD SEEN THERE IS NO WAY THAT WAS SOME TYPE OF EXPLOSION!  BESIDES WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THESE LIGHTS BEING SEEN 2 DAYS LATER ALSO SEEN IN THE MORNING.. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY A TRIP!  NATURALLY I COULD NOT TELL WHAT COLOR IT WAS. I COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT I WAS IN COMPLETE AWE AND STILL AM!  BESIDES I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE ARE THE ONLY BEINGS THAT GOD CREATED. AND NOW I HAVE SEEN THAT FIRST HAND FOR MYSELF TO CONFIRM THAT THEORY.  THE STRANGE PART ABOUT IT AND I WAS THINKING THIS AT THE TIME OF WATCHING IT!  WAS IT DIDN'T TAKE OFF LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTING LIKE OTHER REPORTS THAT I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS THING JUST HOVERED AND FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.  IT FINALLY MOVED COMING CLOSER TO ME THAT'S WHEN I NOTICED THE SHAPE OF IT AND COULD SEE THE WHITE LIGHTS OUTLINING IT.  AFTER A WHILE IT STARTED TO ASCEND STRAIGHT UP HIGHER THAN ANY AIRCRAFT, HELICOPTER OR ANY OTHER MAN MADE AIR CRAFT COULD GO!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Strange Disc Shaped UFO Flying under plane on Descent into Phoenix, AZ Airport.;2013-05-27 15:00:00;30 seconds;Strange Disc Shaped UFO Flying under plane on Descent into Phoenix, AZ Airport I was on a flight yesterday from San Fransisco to Phoenix...  Just before final descent into Phoenix I noticed a strange object flying below the plane on my side.  I had been taking a few pics with my phone to show my kids the view from the plane so It was handy.  The object seamed to stay in line and in time with the plane only much further below us..  Then it started to move away from the plane.  That is when I snapped a picture just before it stopped moving forward and it appeared to stop as we continued on.  It was out of site in a matter of a second or two.  Here is a picture of what I saw... then I enlarged the object a little too.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
