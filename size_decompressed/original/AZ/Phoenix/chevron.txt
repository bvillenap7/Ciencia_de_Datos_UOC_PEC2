Phoenix lights witnessed and documented two months prior to major sighting.;1997-01-01 19:30:00;20 minutes;Phoenix lights witnessed and documented two months prior to major sighting. On the evening of January 1, 1997, we observed small bouncing lights in the Phoenix sky south of South  mountain.  The small lights roughly the size of a small magnitude star were bouncing around on the horizon.  Shortly thereafter we observed 5 bright lights flying over us in a V-Shape.  They were identical to that of the Phoenix lights which were videotaped in March of 1997.  The V-Shape lights flew from the southeast to the northwest towards Las Vegas.  There was absolutely no sound from the object.  After the incident I telephoned Sky Harbor Airport who referred me to Luke Air Force Base who in turn referred me to Peter Davenport of the UFO reporting center in Washington state.  We only gave my aunt's name to Mr. Davenport.  I was quite shocked to learn of the March 1997 sightings again.  I decided to again report this when I heard Mr. Davenport on KFI radio and called in to the radio station.  They put me on the air but did not further question me.  I was left hanging.  This sighting, two months prior to the sighting of the Phoenix lights needs to be brought forward.  My Aunt's name appeared on a television show as one of the people who witnessed the Phoenix lights.  Her name is ((name deleted)). My uncle who also witnessed the sighting is an engineer as is my cousin who was also a witness. ((NUFORC Note:  This individual hear me discussing the Phoenix Lights sighting on a radio program (Lee Klein/KFI-AM, Los Angeles, 12OC02) and called in during the program.

V-shaped craft observed flying east over Phoenix.;1997-03-05 14:00:00;60 minutes;V-shaped craft observed flying east over Phoenix. On a clear sunny day I observed what looked like a V-shaped silver craft approach Phoenix, Arizona, directly from the west. I watched it cross the valley of the sun for an hour. At the time I was at work. My desk was next to a window on the second floor of a building that was situated on the side of South Mountain. From my vantage point I could see the entire valley for 20 miles in every direction except south. I could also see dozens of aircraft approach or depart Sky Harbor airport all day long. When I first saw the V-shaped silver craft approach from the west, I at first thought that it was a specially designed aircraft coming into Sky Harbor. I pointed it out to a co-worker and asked him what he thought it was. He didn't know. Strangely, as the craft neared Sky Harbor, it veered to the north and skirted the airport. Both my co-worker and myself wondered out loud about the craft and where it was going. Fortunately, as the craft continued to fly due east it got closer to us. It completely bypassed the airport and continued east. Though we couldn't make out details, we noticed that the V-shape of the craft began to change and warp. We then realized that we were probably witnessing a flock of silver-backed ducks. They eventually disappeared out of sight still heading east. I only mention this because it may have a bearing on the V-shaped silver craft that was witnessed at night flying over Phoenix just a week later. I did not see the night sightings because I was in bed, since I had to work an early shift. Though I had seen ducks in flight, I puzzled over why they were heading east. After all, this is a desert, and most migratory birds fly north and south. A week later I found my answer. Thirty miles due east of Phoenix there's a town called Fountain Hills. In the middle of this desert community there's a huge man-made lake. In the middle of this lake lies the world's tallest fountain. I drove out there. Once I got to the lake, there were hundreds of ducks, all species. Brown, black, white -- and sil! ver. I c annot confirm that the V-shaped craft many people witnessed that one night in March, 1997, was a flock of ducks -- but it's the truth that I saw them migrating during the day just a week prior. My experience might help provide a logical answer to why the V-shaped craft proceeded over Phoenix at such as slow rate of speed. Most people usually report UFO's flying at a high rate of speed. By the way, the V-shaped craft, if I recall correctly, was also flying east. I know that this explanation might prove disappointing to UFO enthusiasts, but not all UFO's are alien. Some are of earthly origin provided by mother nature herself.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

V shaped black object with 5 lights, passed directlyover our house in Phoenix and didn't make a sound. It's shapewas that of a carpen;1997-03-13 20:00:00;10 minutes;Summary : V shaped black object with 5 lights, passed directlyover our house in Phoenix and didn't make a sound. It's shape was that of a carpenter's square set at about 60 degrees, each arm about 300 feet long. My 10 year old son and I had just arrived hope about 8pm and as he waited in the car for me to come around and open the door, he was looking towards the Northwest to see if the comet might still be visible, when he saw a grouping of lights. I looked and what I saw was what looked like at first a pattern of 5 lights in a half oval on its up side. I thought it was a blimp with lights on it. It seemed to be floating but I noticed it was coming directly in our direction. My son went in the house and got my wife, my 13 year old grandson and my 18 year old daughter, to come outside. We all watched these lights approach. Whatever it was it was moving rather slowly. As it came close it no longer had an up-oval shape, but began to look more lie a V of 5 lights, with one light in the center lead point and two lights on each side. The angle of the V was not very sharp, maybe 60 degrees.As we stood there watching we were completely flabergasted because it was going to pass directly over our house.  And it did. It passed directly over head maybe a thousand or so feet overhead. Our house is up on the side of a mountain in the Northeast part of Phoenix and we can see pretty far to the northwest and southwest. When it passed overhead we all were looking at it and talking. For one thing, it seemed to float over us and it made absolutely no detectable sound at all.  We were trying to imagine what it was. It certainly couldn't be a group of aircraft flying in formation, because the lights remained absolutely fixed in relationship with each other. As we looked up we could see through the middle of the V but each arm seemed to be flat shaped like a ruler, and rather long from the first lead light to the tip lights, maybe a couple of hundred feet or more. It was huge.The kids got a little frightened, I suppose because we had no explanation for what we were seeing. We watched it continue to fly towards the southeast until we no longer could see any lights.My background: I am 54 years old, in perfect health. I have a Masters Degree from Columbia University Teacher's College. Formerly worked for IBM as a systems engineer. More recently worked in the electronics repair industry in management. Presently executive in a manufacturing firm. My wife is a secretary at St Mary's Catholic High School. My one daughter is an honor student at the High School. We live up on the side of this mountain and are always looking at the sky, so if we're outside not much is going to go by without us seeing it. And we all have never seen anything like this.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
An object, consisting of 5 lights, in the shape of an arrow, flew right over my house.;1997-03-13 20:00:00;5 min. approx.;An object, consisting of 5 lights, in the shape of an arrow, flew right over my house. I was on my way to the store, when I looked up and saw 5 white lights, appearing to be equally spaced, in the shape of a wide arrowhead.  The lights were coming over a mountain, to the north of my house, that is used for hang gliding. That was my first thought, a hang glider strung with lights.  But the lights were bright enough to show that they were not attached to a hang glider frame. A friend was coming to my house the same time I was leaving, so I pointed the lights out to him.  On my way to the store, I noticed my neighbers outside also watching the lights.  I stopped to talk to them about it, and we all came to the conclusion that what we were seeing was a UFO. The object didn't emit any sound, and flew from north to south.  I first noticed it above Shaw Butte Mountain (15th Ave. and Cholla) and last saw it around 13th Ave. and Mercer Lane. The store trip took me 10 minutes, max.  I drove around a little, looking for the mysterious lights, but they were nowhere to be found.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Witnessed the object travel south along Interstate 10 toward Casa Grande;1997-03-13 20:30:00;20 minutes;Witnessed the object travel south along Interstate 10 toward Casa Grande On the evening of March 13, 1997, my son and I were driving on I-10 where it flows due East through Phoenix AZ. The time was approximately 8:30 P. M.. I noticed what I initially thought was a long line of commercial aircraft approaching Sky Harbor International Air Port from the North preparing for a Westerly landing. I remember thinking it odd that they all appeared to be at the same elevation and none were changing position. As we continued on, I-10 turns South heading toward Casa Grande and Tucson. At that time I lost sight and interest  in the lights. We left I-10 at the Riggs Road exit and headed East towards my son's home. I again noticed that the lights were still in the same type of pattern and at the same altitude. They also appeared to be much closer. We arrived at my son's home some 5 minutes later and I went outside to check on the lights while the rest of the family ate dinner. By this time, it was clear that the lights were not separate lights but actually fixed in position relative to each other. They appeared to be part of a structure that was in the shape of a very large v and were moving South and appeared to be over, or very close to, I-10. The lights were on the leading edge of whatever this was. I remember that there were approximately 10 to 13 lights which would appear to extinguish and re-light in no particular sequence. (Could the lights be some form of propulsion?) To say that the object was large is an understatement. It was traveling South approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, moving very slowly and with absolutely no sound. If it was directly over I-10 1 mile to the West, it would be in the range of ½ mile wide. I followed the vehicle for nearly 15 to 20 minutes as it passed through my field of vision from what would be North by North West to South by South West. Using 15 minutes to traverse this roughly 210 degree arc, 1 mile away equates to a an approximate air speed of 15 to 20 mph. The vehicle was obviously solid in nature. As it passed by, the stars in the field of view were not visible behind the vehicle (or whatever it was). As it passed by, the number of lights still visible was reduced as the starboard leading edge was blocked from view. This only served to further substantiate my opinion that the phenomenon was solid. I was located in an area that had very little ambient light so the stars were clearly visible. It passed from view as it traveled toward Casa Grande, 25 miles to the south. It is important to note that the lights I witnessed had nothing to do with the widely reported Phoenix Lights that descended behind South Mountain, West of my position. I did not observe those lights which have been reported, from at least one source, that they were a diversion to draw attention from the vehicle that I saw. Name to be withheld, please.

Five V-shaped lights heading south on I-17 toward Phoenix;1997-03-13 21:00:00;30;Five V-shaped lights heading south on I-17 toward Phoenix My wife and I were driving from Sedona, Arizona to Phoenix on the evening of March 13, 1997.  We were traveling south on I-17 about 30 miles north of Phoenix.  It was slightly after dark.  My wife and I both noticed a V-shaped formation of 5 lights flying south at a slow speed.   The lights were to the right of us and almost above us (we needed to lean forward and look up and to the right through the windshield of the car).   The lights continued south along I-17 at roughly the same speed as our car for almost 30 minutes.  There was no visible object between the lights.   The lights were moving slowly for an aircraft and we assumed it could only be something like a group of helicopters flying in formation.   We drove to a hotel near Sky Harbor airport in Phoenix.  When we got out of the car, I scanned the sky again for the lights and did not see them.   I do not recall the exact time of this incident, but I believe it was around 9:30 or 10pm when we arrived at Sky Harbor.  The lights were visible along the west side of I-17, traveling south, for at least 20 to 30 minutes.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Nine bright white lights forming a chevron;2002-12-27 20:25:00;1 minute;Nine bright white lights forming a chevron We were driving south on 40th Street in Phoenix, approaching Greenway.  What we saw, moving extremely fast almost due south, over the Phoenix Mountain Perserve, Squaw Peak area, was 9 very bright lights, shaped in the form of a chevron.  There were 4 on each side and one in the very front.  These lights were extremely bright, white.  The UFO was only visible for about 5 seconds, and then was blocked by Squaw Peak.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
large chevron with blue and red solid light lights proceeding south to north at constant speed;2008-11-07 17:45:00;3 minutes;large chevron with blue and red solid light lights proceeding south to north at constant speed I stepped outside with the dogs at about 7:45 in the evening and caught movement in the corner of my eye and looked up.  I expected to see an airplane but saw the craft.  I was a wing shape and seemed to have blue and red lights covering the entire craft indicating the shape.  It moved at a consistent and leisure speed from south to north.  It made no discernable sound.  I had the impression that it was extremely large.  It appeared to be bigger than anything I have seen fly.  I called my wife who was about 2 miles away.  She saw what appeared to be 2 military aircraft proceeding from east to west toward the location and 1 military aircraft proceeding west to east toward the site.  She said she thought they were military aircraft because they were very small but moved extremely quickly through the sky for a second or two before cruising at normal aircraft speed.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
4 Orange Lights Spotted South Of The Phoenix Area.;2014-12-11 20:04:00;3 minutes;4 Orange Lights Spotted South Of The Phoenix Area Driving home from work, heading west bound on the loop 202, I notice 4 extremely bright orange balls of light hovering over the horizon.  As I approached the Ahwatukee area entering onto Pecos Rd it became clear these 4 lights were far off in the distance near the southern tip of the Estrella Mountain Range.  I have witness these UFO's before back in the late 90's with father, very similar in fashion to the famous Phoenix Lights.  I see planes come and go every night, and I know what their landing lights look like.  These were much brighter and far larger in their radiant glow.  It appeared to me that they were even gaining altitude.   I lost sight of them as I went under the I-10 interchange.  When I came out the other side past Pecos Park I caught a glimpse of them right as they blinked out of existence separately, but rapidly in succession.  Some background info: I am an avid aerospace enthusiast and have flown several air craft myself.  But I am not a licensed pilot.   My father, who did not witness these, but the previous ones in the 90's, said he had seen nothing like it.  He is an aerospace tech who works on jet engines and was a former aircraft mechanic in the U.S. Air Force.  Commonly our local Luke Air Force base claims these lights are flares from the fighters performing bombing runs at the Barry Goldwater Range.  While this is a large range its no where near the location of these lights.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Nighttime observation of chevron shaped object with light on the bottom traveling at a high rate of speed.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-14 23:00:00;5 seconds;Nighttime observation of chevron shaped object with light on the bottom traveling at a high rate of speed. About 11:00pm, in the city of Phoenix, Az, about 5 miles South of Sky Harbor airport, as I sat in my backyard I observed a black chevron-shaped UFO pass over me as it traveled in a South-Easterly direction at a quite high rate of speed.  The object was in my field of vision for at least three seconds but no more than five as it passed overhead in total silence.  I had no reference to be able to judge its size or altitude accurately, but if I had to estimate its altitude I would suggest that it would be in the 500-750ft range.  If one were to make a 'peace sign' with their left hand and hold these fingers at arm's length, this would approximate its apparent size and shape. The object was black, darker than the night sky as we have a lot of light pollution.  The underside of the craft had circular lights on the bottom.
