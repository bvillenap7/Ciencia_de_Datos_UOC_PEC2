Bright green light that had no origin and caused power outage;1984-03-12 23:00:00;One minute;Bright green light that had no origin and caused power outage My boyfriend and I were staying at an Airbnb in Phoenix on March 12, 2020.  We were watching tv sometime after 10:30pm and there was about 3 quick noises (like a low hum/hard to explain in the writing) that lasted a few seconds and a second after it started there was a green light.  Everything turned bright green.  It happened so fast, but we both remember it was like we put on colored glasses...everything was bright green, the room lit up.  Then the noise and light disappeared and the power went out.  Not just for us, but for a lot of people in the surrounding neighborhood because we looked out our window and it was dark everywhere.  The next morning we tried looking up anything regarding the power outage or lights/noises and we have still found nothing.  I’m grateful he was still awake with me to experience it because I would be seriously worried about my normality if I went through this alone.  I’ve never seen a room light up, especially in that color and! it didn’t come from anywhere.  The windows were covered in drapes and even if it did come through the window it would never be able to light up a room the way this did.  I lived in Phoenix for a little over ten years and never had any experience that was unordinary.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Triangular figgure that was not registered in local air ops.;1990-08-21 22:19:00;30 minutes;Triangular figure that was not registered in local air ops. I seen a triangular figure that was large and had what looked like navigation lights on the front of it.   At the time of the sighting, I contacted the local air operations and there was not any air craft identified in the area.   It was in the middle of a field and it faced towards the interstate and it took off going from 0 miles per hour to what looked like a super sonic speed.

The phoenix lights;1997-03-13 00:00:00;couple minutes;The phoenix lights it was sometime in the evening after dark, my daughter and i were leaving a movie theater on ray road driving west toward our home also on ray road. As we are driving i notice lights in the sky, i yell to my daughter look look in the sky! she leans forward and looks up I see it what is that? its not a plane its hovering looks like a boomerang we came to a stop to get a better look and you could see white lights in the shave of a v and you could just barely see the outline of the thing as it was dark. It was huge and it looked close, hard to say how close it really was as we were inside our car. We joked around about it being her first UFO sighting not sure what we had seen and then that night when we turned on the news it was all over the place! everyone had seen it!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

This was real, and not flares!;1997-03-13 22:00:00;30 minutes;This was real, and not flares! It was the night of  Thursday, March 13, 1997.  I was living in an apartment in Phoenix Arizona at the time and had some friends over that night.  We all went outside and I noticed several lights in the sky over Phoenix.  Soon my friends and I were all staring at these lights in the sky.  There was no noise at all coming from these lights.  They were yellowish-orange in color.  As I focused my eyes on the lights I could make out the shapes of actual solid craft in the sky.  It wasn’t one large craft, it was several craft which made a large triangle shape, then a large oval shape!  My friends also could see the shape of these craft in the sky.  These craft would move up and down, and left to right but didn’t move all that much.  They didn’t shoot across the sky or anything like that.  But I could see the shape of these craft in the sky.  This lasted for about 30 minutes and the lights turned off and the craft disappeared.  I have spent 8 years in the Army and I know what flares look like and how they act.  These were not flares.  I can say this with confidence.  The U.S. Government stone walled the people of Phoenix.  Thousands of people had to have witnessed this event that night.

I was driving from California to Phoenix at night to see my wife and son and there was an 18 wheeler in front of me.  We both pulled over because there was a boomerang shaped spacecraft flying back and forth about 10 feet over the highway and we would have hit it if we didn't pull over.  It had lights all along the front of the wings and made a low rumbling sound, it lasted about 10 minutes until we drove off and it continued.  I don't believe in UFOs...

Object like uprooted tree drifting over Arizona desert.;1997-07-04 20:30:00;10 minutes;Object like uprooted tree drifting over Arizona desert I am reporting this event that occurred 18 years ago, only because it was so highly unusual.  I am sure of the date and time, as it was the 4th of July, and my brother and I were living in Phoenix at the time.  We had decided to go to a small desert park near Camelback Mountain, climb some rocks and watch the fireworks in the city below.   We parked at a dead end street and were walking toward the desert when I noticed an odd thing in the sky, moving rather slowly.  It was nearing dusk and the sky was cloudless.  The item was dark and had an irregular shape.   I pointed it out to my brother and he quickly went back to his truck to get a pair of binoculars that he always carried with him.  We estimated that it was about 800 feet above the ground, and it was moving south to north, very smoothly, as if propelled in some manner (not moving erratically or intermittently as a balloon might do).  If it was at the estimated height of 800 feet then we guessed that it might have! been from 10 to 12 feet in diameter.   We each got a good look at it in the binoculars, and it appeared to be nothing so much as an uprooted tree with roots dangling below.  There was some kind of rotating platform on the upper portion of the “tree roots,” and some kind of a weird-looking appendage that stuck out of the top of the rotating platform.  The appendage was very thin and slightly curved, and appeared to be dangling something over the side of the rotating platform.   Astonished, we stopped two passers-by who were also heading into the rock formations and pointed out the bizarre thing in the sky.  They took a look at it through the binoculars as well, made a comment about how odd it was (I guess!) and then strolled off.   We stood and watched the thing disappear over the mountains into the darkening sky, total time of sighting was approximately 10 minutes.  There were no lights on it, and it made no sound.   Later that night my brother and I agreed to separately draw what we had seen and compare the pictures.  It was clear that we did see the same thing.  We have no idea what it was.  My brother has since passed on but he was an astronomy major in college, and I had spent six years in the military.  We were both over 40 years old at the time of the sighting.   We considered all possibilities, but could not even venture a guess as to how such a thing could be hoaxed.  Since that time, I’ve heard about the “jellyfish” UFOs and have wondered if that is what it was.   Since we expected to be spending time in the dark outside, we had no camera with us and this was long before the cell phone age, unfortunately.   I just wanted to mention this event which we did not report at the time, in case anyone else has seen something similar and would like to know if others have had the experience. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Mr. Davenport,  thank you so much for noticing my report.  My brother who was with me at the time passed on in Florida in 2009 and many of his effects were boxed and given to friends, so I don't have his original drawing, and I have moved so many times since then, that I'm sure I have no idea where mine went.  I could certainly re-draw it, however.  It's not a thing I'm ever going to forget. I've been a Coast listener for many years, but it never occurred to me to report my sighting, until I recently heard you mention that you were interested in past reports, as well as new ones.   I was visiting your site for the first time this past weekend and reading mostly about the Washington reports since I live here now.  I went to Arizona's listings too and checked around the date of my sighting and saw there were some reports from that date in Arizona, but nothing very similar to mine.   Interesting that you mentioned Mars, by the way -- I've always been particularly fascinated by that planet and have been following Curiosity's progress toward Mt. Sharp over the last few years.  I also spend a lot of time on Google Mars just roaming around to see what they will allow us to see, and I never get tired of that.  I can't wait until we have Google Venus and Google Saturn, etc.!  I was impressed to find that the dates of your collected reports went back so far.  What a great resource for researchers.  Now that I'm familiar with your site, I'll check it often, and be sure to add my own sightings, should I have any more in the future.  Kudos for all the very hard work you must do to keep it organized and available to everybody. Again, I'll be glad to redraw the UFO I saw.  I do have a cell phone available so I can send a pic through email or as a phone message attachment, or I can just snail-mail it to you if you like.  Let me know how you'd prefer to receive it. Thank you, once more for all that you do and especially how you share it so freely with all of us. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
We saw a very bright light that looked like a comet, with a smoke looking trail coming from behind the light.;1999-03-04 20:45:00;Five Minutes;We saw a very bright light that looked like a comet, with a smoke looking trail coming from behind the light. We viewed the light while traveling West on Interstate 60, the Superstition Freeway at about 8:45PM.  My brother saw it first, as I was driving.  He remarked something to the effect of What the hell is that a comet?  I looked up and saw an extremely bright light traveling at a very slow rate of speed in a north to south direction.  It looked exactly like pictures of comets that I have seen, a very white part, followed by a long smokey trail. It appeared fairly close to the ground, perhaps 2,000 feet. It was very bright for about twenty to thirty seconds and then it went out.  You could see what appeared to be a smoke trail after it.  It did not have any type of blinking navigation lights like an aircraft.  The bright light was at the aft end of the object as it traveled south.  It could not have been a search light from a helicopter or a landing light as it was pointing in the wrong direction(unless some crafts have landing lights on the rear of them).  We continued to look at the apparent course of travel for about 2-3 minutes.  Suddenly the light appeared again, perhaps 3-5 miles south, south west of the first sighting. I viewed the first incident through the front windshield.  I wanted to rule out reflections so I rolled down my window and viewed the lights clearly through the drivers side window. It exhibited the exact same characteristics, very bright, no Nav lights, smoke trailing from behind it.  It stayed illuminated for about fifteen or twenty seconds and went out again. You could clearly observe some type of smoke trailing from behind the object.  The smoke did not swirl or appear to move as if acted upon by rotor blades, jet engines, etc.  The object could not have been a jet, as if in afterburners, as it was moving far too slow to be a jet in burners.  Further, the color exhibited was very pure white and had not blue colored flame to it like a jet engine does.  It could not have been a balloon as it was too low, you could have easily seen the balloon being illuminated by the flame, furt! her it was moving too fast to be a hot air balloon.  It obsolutely was not any type of flare as has been reported by many in the past.  It was moving too fast to be a flare floating in the wind, and it would have been low enough to see a parachute suspending it.  Further, I am unaware of a flare that can relight itself after traveling five miles at a constant altitude.  There were no aircraft in the immediate vicinity of the light which could have released a flare.  The closest airforce base would be Luke some twenty miles to the north west and no military aircraft of any type were seen.  However, there were about a dozen commercial aircraft in the pattern around SkyHarbor.  They were very obviously aircraft with Nav lights.  Several were traveling south of the airport in an Easterly direction.  It would have been very easy for them to see the lights, at a lower altitude and directly in front of them.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Phoenix Blue/white Astroid????;2000-09-30 20:00:00;4-5 seconds;Phoenix Blue/white Astroid???? It was very dark as my son and I prepared to get ready to change over to night fishing at a lake called Pleasent aprox. 50 miles due north of Phoenix. My son said Dad at least 3 quick times,(my son is 23) to draw my attention to the object that had lighted up south of our location. I turned around very quickley to see a very bright white/blue object of great size traveling at a speed that my son and I agreed would see the object fall to earth very soon ( in fact I kept looking to see a mushroom cloud rise above the hills to our west) there was no cloud nor any sound at all. The object appeared to me to be almost square in size, lile a cube, picture a square moving left to right, now cut into fourths, remove the lower left square and slide it to the left and down to leave a equal gap you'll see a 7, with a square following at the same speed. The object was bright enough to light the lake and the hills around us, it's colors were like a cutting tourch used for cutting steel (in fact the trailing sparks were brighter than steel being cut by a cutting tourch, the sparks trailed the object by about three times its size. The size of the object was hard to figure, but with the skyline of the city & lights to guage, the object was huge, I would say more that a a mile or two across or cubed.  It was approximately 40 to 45 degrees above the south horizon, and was not traveling at the speed of a metorite, it was as a slower astroid would travel. the direction was east to west, in fact I was thinking to myself that california would now have another disaster to bare. there was no sound or vibrations, there was no blinking lights, there was only white, blue and some orange hues in the short tail, the object only went in a straight line, no turns, but almost a failing arc to the west (thus, our thinking that it would fall in west Arizona or eastern California. The exact time is hard for us to pin down, we were with out watches, We are thinking that with the sundown not too far behind and our best guessing it was around 8 PM.

Low altitude passenger-type jet emitting thick contrails blinks out of sight in a cloudless, baby blue sky!;2002-02-03 18:15:00;approx. 2 min.;Low altitude passenger-type jet emitting thick contrails blinks out of sight in a cloudless, baby blue sky! It was 18:15 on  Super Bowl Sunday. I went outside to the backyard to check the turkey roasting on the barbeque. The day was a beautiful clear day in Phoenix, Arizona. The sky was baby blue and cloudless. As I was tending to the turkey, I heard a very loud jet roar. The sound was louder than normal so I looked up. The first thing I noticed was a very thick double contrail not very high  up in the sky. My eyes followed it to the object making it. It was a white passenger type jet. From where I stood, the craft was five inches long, and it was near enough to make out what airline it was, but there wern't any markings at all. The thick contrails were emitting from each wing. The aircraft was heading from SW to NW. As I watched the contrails continued unbroken then suddenly each contrail had a short break in it, and then each contrail continued for a very short length and then the entire passenger-type jet Blinked Out! It just vanished into a clear baby blue sky before my eyes! It was nowhere to be seen. I went inside to record the event in my journal. ((NUFORC Note:  We have not received any other reports about the incident, but would like to have anyone who may have been witness to this incident to submit a report.  A typical airliner, that appears to a witness on the ground to be five inches long, would, indeed, be at a very low altitude.  Typically, jet aircraft at low altitude do not generate contrails.

Amber orbs that glow bright, disappear and reappear.;2002-03-20 19:35:00;4hours;Amber orbs that glow bright, disappear and reappear. Myself, staff, and guest were out on the patio of a Upscale North Scottsdale Resort when we saw a number of objects hovering in lower South West Phoenix, near, or past Squaw peak.  These objects were very bright, and would flicker like a candle from very bright to going completely out.  The objects would once again appear in another ( fairly close) area, in a different pattern.  At one time ,there were four objects lined evenly spaced in a horizontal pattern.  Later, it looked as though (to me) that 3 of the objects were close together (3 orbs in a packed triangle pattern) and that is when I saw them the brightest. We ( myself, staff members/various guests) have seen these lights for the past couple of weeks, mostly in the same area...from behind squaw peak/west.  There are at least two, but sometimes more.  They seem amber in color, and once they light up..they do not move until they fade out and then they reappear. They are VERY bright in contast to the plethera of air traffic that we see going into sky harbor and Scottsdale. Also, one night last week, an employee, myself, and a couple of guests saw a red orb move across the sky as though on a wave, like a boat would move on a lake, gently rocking up and down.  It came from the south west, cut in front of us about 5 miles, and went behind the Mcdowell mountains. I looked up on line the phoenix ufo sight ( I can't remember the name ) and sent a letter to Jeff Rense...Rense.com to see if anyone else is seeing these lights. I am just interested in what they could be. I KNOW that alot of people see them because guest ask me about them and point them out to me.  ( Seen between 7:30 and 11:00) and I did not see any tonight 3/22/02.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Object looked like a Satellite traveling from northwest to southeast.  Object began a gentle turn toward the east and exhibited an increase in velocity for approximately one or two seconds.  Object then turned sharply north and increased velocity again for about one half to one second at that point the object appeared to dive or decrease at a very steep angle, straightened out to a level trajectory for a short time and again appeared to initiate a dive.  During the second dive the object left a trail behind it much like a meteor or falling star.  The object then seemed to clime back to its original altitude and very abruptly change direction back toward the south, southeast.  While traveling at a high rate of speed the object zigzag east to west while continuing in its overall south-southeast direction.

A silent, silver bell-shaped metallic object which emitted an orange glow was observed in the afternoon by 3 persons in Phoenix, AZ.;2002-12-31 16:40:00;10 minutes;A silent, silver bell-shaped metallic object which emitted an orange glow was observed in the afternoon by 3 persons in Phoenix, AZ. A silver bell-shaped metallic object which emitted an orange light was observed traveling northbound at a rate of approximately 180 mph & at an elevation of approximately 2000 feet for a period of ten minutes by three individuals in Phoenix,AZ on the afternoon of December 31, 2002. The object noiselessly covered a distance of 30 miles in a period of about 10 minutes, passing over the cities of Chandler, South Phoenix & Scottsdale, AZ. It was moving parallel & nearly directly above the Interstate 10 Freeway. The object was observed from the parking lot of the 3 observers place of employment. The object had an irregular flight path, constantly, if only slightly, changing altitude & direction, but moving in a northerly direction. It was observed from a distance of roughly 1 to 3 miles. Due to the clear daylight conditions and close proximity of its observers, as well as the object's omnidirectional movements, it's shape was clearly discernable & was not that of any aircraft known to the observers. There was no tail, wings, fuselage or propellers visible. As it maneuvered perpendicular to the earth, its underside was seen to be black. When horizontal, it appeared the have a highly reflective metal surface. There was an intermittent orange glow about it. When 1st sighted (at a distance of 3 to 5 miles, it had a diffused look, reminiscent of a gigantic piece of Saran Wrap, but quickly & unexpectedly assumed a much smaller solid & more circular appearance as it quickly moved closer to the initial observer. At its closest point, relative to the observers, its somewhat bell shaped outline became apparent.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Unknown Craft Hovers Over I-10;2004-12-10 19:30:00;5 minutes;Unknown Craft Hovers Over I-10 I was heading east on interstate 10 on the evening of December 10th, 2004 when ahead of me in the distance on the right side hovering just off the freeway shoulder, I am guessing a few hundred feet from the ground, was an object.  It had a bright white light in the middle of it, and extending from either side of this craft were two rectangular shaped arms.  Those were also lit brightly. (white light)   The curious thing though, as I drove closer to it, I noticed, what I can only describe as panels.  They appeared black.  and every other panel was lite very brightly. This was no plane as I noticed no beacon lights on it.  Thinking it may have been a helicopter I looked for signs of the tail.  There was none.  I pulled over on the side of the road. My vehicle was facing east and I was facing west.  It had no markings of a helicopter or a conventional aircraft.  The closes I could come to what it looked like was a satelite.  Though NO satelite hovers in earths atmoshpere especially this close to the ground.  I watched it as it hovered and it headed in a southern direction. I also noticed the traffic on the highway was also slowing down.  I estimate viewing this for at least five minutes until this craft slowly picked up speed then darted off quickly in a southern direction.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Bright White Lights Phoenix;2005-05-11 03:45:00;5 minutes;Bright White Lights Phoenix Just moved from Miami to San Jose.  I drove from Miami to Lake Charles, LA the first day, which was 15 hours of driving. Then I went from Lake Charles to Phoenix on Tuesday arriving in Phoenix at 4:30am after 20 hours of driving.  I noticed about three flashes of light in West Texas and New Mexico, which I ignored until I got to AZ.  I was very tired as I left Tucson. About 25 miles South of South Mountain in Phoenix I had the sighting.  I was driving on I-10, which goes North from Tucson to Phoenix.  I saw a very bright white light on an aircraft to the east of I-10. The craft has a flashing blue light like in a tail area so I assumed a light plane or helicopter.  I heard no noise though. Then the tail light started to whip around in a fashion suggesting it was not attached to the craft.  The craft was also moving erractically and very quickly.  So I though wow, I´m really tired.  Then on the west side of I-10, I saw 4 very bright white lights that lit up very quickly and flew at I-10 at a very high speed and zoomed up in a parabolic way and disappeared. This was very odd.  Finally I saw a very bright light in front of me in the sky. The light got very bright and then dimmed revealing the bottom of a craft shaped like an old fashioned keyhole. The base of the craft had blue and pinkish red lights.  I know this sounds weird, but I did see it, as described.  I don´t know what this was, but it is the strangest thing I have ever seen.

On 12-1-2005 at around 18:00 hrs my wife and I had just finished stringing up are outdoor Christmas lights across the front roof line of the house. We had used clear blinking lights that we had placed in a Red-Green-Yellow-Blue order.  All of the bulb's were working and had begun to flash on and off. We then noticed that about a half dozen of the lights furthest from us had begun to chase themselves back and forth numerous times.  We were both amazed. I continued to watch this light show when I noticed my wife was not.  Her attention had been caught by movement over the top of the house. Looking upwards I caught sight of the object that she was looking at.  There at about 50ft above the house was a oblong (?) shaped craft that was moving silently in a southernly direction.  It seemed to be reflecting the color's of the light's -Red-Green-Yellow-Blue. We think the craft was about 10-15 ft long.  It seemed to have no external propulsion system, no navigation light's nor rudder.  It did seem to have electro-chromatic skin though. We eventually lost sight of the craft as we had to run around a tree in the front yard to see it. It was gone. We have not seen it since then.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
long missile shaped object;2006-01-17 15:20:00;1minute 30 sec.;long missile shaped object Me and my friend were outside at mountain Pointe highschool. I was looking at planes in the sky when i noticed that there was a huge black missle looking object in the sky. I could not see any wings. From where i was standing it seemed to be smooth like a missile.It had a smoke trail behind it like an ordinary jet but slightly bigger. When i compared it to other planes flying at the same altitude, i decided that it had to be at leat 40 times bigger looking than the jets. It was moving southwest at a fairly high rate of speed. I lost sight of the object when it flew out of seeing range.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
VERTICAL RAINBOW INSIDE GLASS LIKE TRIANGLE OVER PHOENIX;2006-02-04 17:00:00;20-30 minutes;VERTICAL RAINBOW INSIDE GLASS LIKE TRIANGLE OVER PHOENIX In the Western sky a large vertical rainbow appeared for quite some time, witin a huge whitish into translucent sharp edged two-sided with open center triangle. To the north of this incredible and stunning scene were a series of white similar in size triangles one above the other in also a vertical postion.  The rainbow was very large and of equal width up and down with what I thought was the sun at the base of it-due to the brillance and size-but upon walking back out only a couple of minutes later I could tell the sun must be too low on the horizon...what is all this?? A jet appeared to be in the process of intersecting with the base of the rainbow upon second time out to look at it. I saw it on the news as they went into commercial, but did not catch if they had explained this very strange thing.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Golden flying wing.;2006-04-30 00:11:00;15 seconds;Golden flying wing. It was just after midnight.  I was looking up and noticed what I thought may have been an owl at first flying low and close to street lights.  The reason I thought that was because the light given off was a golden or light orange color.  Then I realized the figure was up higher and moving faster.  I thought it was a plane but it had no blinking red or green lights.  By this time my friend was looking on.  We both notice how fast it was moving though it was not streaking. My freind said it looked like it had a bar of lights on the underneath side of the craft.  I would resemble it to a flying wing that was completely illuminated on the underside with its lights having partioning lines between them. It appeared so large at first that I thought it could have been an owl perhaps 50 yards away illuminated by street lights.  This thing just kept on going and was out of site much more quickly than a plane that stared out looking that big. The direction it was flying in was southwest.  It disappeared within a span of 15 seconds. Again, it appeared to have the shape of a flying wing or just a bank of lights like a somewhat rectangular thing flying with the wide side forward. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a wedge of migratory birds would first have to be ruled out, before it could be concluded that the witnesses observed a genuine UFO.  However, please see other reports from Portland, OR, and Idaho for the same date.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Through the binoculars the flashing object looked like a piece of falling metal, but the object was not loosing altitude visibly, just tubling like it was falling.  Have no idea what I saw.

We were somewhere in between Riggs and Pecos Rd.'s when my attention was caught by a crescent shaped object above South Mountain. The outside was white and middle appeared to be blue and it was floating on an axis. The object blended into the sky quite well. I stared for about 3 seconds, trying to figure out what this object was(a cloud or a plane, maybe?), when all of the sudden, it turned on it's opposite axis and went into a hyperspace type mode and vanished. I said nothing to my husband until we returned home that evening. He said he saw nothing and thinks that I saw nothing either.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Amorphous black object hovering over Phoenix for 1.5 hours;2006-10-06 17:00:00;1.5 hours;Amorphous black object hovering over Phoenix for 1.5 hours I was looking out my window to the west and slightly north at approximately 5:00 p.m. on Oct. 6, 2006 when I noticed a black blip hovering around the clouds.  What caught my eye was that it seemed to hover, then dive, then bounce back upand make quick, abrupt changes in direction.  The object stayed in the same general air space for approximately 1.5 hours.  I attempted to take some photographs, but could not zoom in enough to get a clear shot.  We tried to get a video camera from neighbors but could only find a pair of binouculars.  When we viewed the object through the binoculars, it appeared to be dark in color and somewhat amorphous in shape.  At times, depending on the angle, it looked like a black blob with a tail, like a tadpole.  Later, it appeared to look almost like the silouette of a bat, like something you would see at Halloween.  It also appeared to have something smaller trailing it.  I am not sure, but they may have been connected.  My neighbors and I watched the object until the sun went down, at which time we could no longer see it.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Parachute shaped object over North Phoenix;2007-04-03 22:00:00;30 minutes;Parachute shaped object over North Phoenix I was in my backyard at approximately 10 PM, looked up in the sky, and noticed an object that appeared to be floating in the sky.  The moon was behind me so the light was reflecting off of the object.  I initially thought it was a paraglider, but it was not moving across the sky and there was no sound.  I called my wife out to the yard and she brought binoculars.  I used the binoculars to view the object, it looked like a a group of about 10-20 large white balloons (shaped like a parachute) with a cable pointing towards the ground.  It seemed to be pretty high in the sky, but as it was night I can not say exactly how high it was.  I watched the object for about twenty minutes, it moved slowly back and forth across the sky.  I then went into my front yard and walked up the street about 200 feet, the object was above me and off to the side.  I thought that maybe it was some kids playing a prank, flying an odd shaped kite in the sky at night, so I got in my car and drove to the park up the street.  I didn't see anyone at the park, but I did see some odd flashing lights on or beneath the playground equipment.  I didn't get out of my car so I don't know if there were people on the playground, but I definitely saw some flashing lights on the ground.  I then drove home, viewed the object from the front yard and then the back yard, and then went inside to quickly search the internet for images of weather balloons.  I went outside approximately 5 minutes later and the object was gone.  I awoke the next morning to my alarm clock, it wakes me up to KTAR 92.3 FM, a local talk radio station.  The very memory I have of that morning is listening to a quick story about some large balloons that got loose from a car dealership and a plane almost hit them, and then the announcer quickly moved on to the next story.  I felt like I was awake, but I can't say with 100% accuracy that I did not dream the story.  However, I do have a very clear memory of waking up to that news story.  I searched KTAR's homepage for the balloon story and also searched azcentral.com, but did not find any stories.  The nearest car dealership is about 8 miles away to the southwest.  I have thought of three explanations for what I saw.  The first is that it was someone playing a prank and flying an odd shaped kite or balloon high up in the sky on the night of the full moon.  The second explanation would be some large balloons that got loose from a car dealership.  The third explanation is that it was a UFO.  I doubt the second explanation just because the object was floating above my neighborhood for so long.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
It was about 30 feet high right above my head and looked like a ball of glittering lights.;2007-07-15 18:15:00;3 min;It was about 30 feet high right above my head and looked like a ball of glittering lights. I just got off work near Camelback Rd and 12th St in Phoenix AZ at 6pm and was walking to my car talking on my cell phone, when I heard a helicopter.  So I looked up to see what kind it was. It looked like a news helicopter panted solid black.  It was about 3 telephone poles high. After it past I saw a white light a little lower coming towards me.  Then it curved changed to red and went away from me. It was doing an oval pattern.  It was white coming towards me and red going away from me.  It was probably moving at 30 mph and covered half the length of the block but only as wide as the alley.  It made 4 passes the first three it would get a little closer each time. Then the last and fourth pass it made was right over my head.  It paused there over me for about 2 seconds. As I looked right up at it, it wasn't white or red anymore but a ball of glittering lights.  It was about the sizes of a beach ball.  Then as it went away again it turn red continued down the alley a! little farther this time.  Here is where I got goose bumps and chills.  Instead of coming back it went down and to the right so fast it left a red streak of light in the sky.  It stopped there on a dime for 1 second and changed to a bright white light.  Then it shot up and to the left so fast it left another long red streak of light in the sky and was gone.  The whole time I was watching this ball of light change colors it never made a sound.

Star-like craft over Phoenix Arizona inthe daytime.;2008-03-01 14:00:00;2 weeks;Star-like craft over Phoenix Arizona inthe daytime. The date I have provided is approximate only because I witnessed these craft on a daily basis for over two weeks. I already have numerous sighting statements on record at MUFON that I made daily during the sighting period.  My first sighting of the star-like craft was made in the afternoon here in Phoenix while I was outside on a break. I was looking up at a jetliner that was cruising overhead out of Sky Harbor International airport and I noticed what appeared to be a star shining directly over my head at about 2PM in the afternoon. I was perplexed as to why I would be able to see a star in the middle of the day when suddenly the 'star' started to move very slowly and then stop. I watched it make these manuevers for about 6 minutes but my break was almost over and I had to go back inside to work - however, I thought that I just had to figure out what it was I was looking at. It was so far up that I figured it must be at about a 60 thousand foot level or so. It started moving again and then it just 'popped' out of existence altogether ! I was freaking out at that point. I began to deliberately look up at the sky for the duration of my breaks and lunches and sure enough, every single day I saw these star-like craft just appear out of nowhere and for the most part they would just move across the sky until they were no longer in my range of sight, but the thing that really got to me was the FACT that they would just suddenly appear out of nowhere. About the 3rd day of my seeing these things, I watched a total of 5 of these things appear from the same part of the sky and then move off into different directions until I could no longer see them. On one occasion I watched two disc shaped craft fly over our building at about a 20 thousand foot level and fly side-by-side from west to east at a very fast rate of speed and disappear off in the horizon over Scottsdale Arizona. I would have to estimate that they were flying at around 2000+ miles per hour because of how quickly they traversed the sky. No sound at all came from any of these craft at any time.  I did on 2 different occasions have other employees outside with me that watched the UFO's with me so I at least had witnesses to verify what I was seeing. I don't know what I saw other than the fact that these craft made moves and achieved flight speeds that exceed any known aircraft that I have ever witnessed in my lifetime. Phoenix is has a major air force base to the west called LUKE AFB and it wouldn't surprise me to find out that they have been tracking these craft yet they will never admit it. I have a feeling that the lid is going to be blown off the ET visitors being hee on earth very soon but I for one am anxious to have it happen as soon as possible!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Late-night red lights over Northwest Phoenix moving independent of each other.;2008-05-14 23:44:00;15 minutes;Late-night red lights over Northwest Phoenix moving independent of each other. The phenomenon was observed from 11:44 PM to approximately midnight on May 14, 2008, while facing East from the backyard of our house in Northwest Phoenix.  The object(s) appeared as six round, symmetrical red lights forming a classic capital Y (two lights on each arm and two forming the leg).  Each light was stable when first sighted but it is unknown how long they had been in the formation when originally seen.  By 11:47 PM, three of our household members were in the yard observing (2 adults and 1 teenager), and the pattern slowly shifted to a lower-case y before fading.  Each light either faded or winked until it was no longer visible.  When a light winked it was observable through binoculars as a small while light for a moment, then returned to full strength as a red light.  The white lights could not be seen without binoculars.  Cell phones could not capture a decent image, but the lights were easily visible through binoculars.  There was no evidence of smoke or balloons around the lights, either while red or white.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Black object hovering over central Phoenix;2010-03-05 18:45:00;5 minutes;Black object hovering over central Phoenix While walking my dog at about 6:40 or 6:45 pm on Friday, March 5th, 2010, I observed what I initially thought was a helicopter or balloon in the twilight blue sky directly and westward above me in north central Phoenix.  However, after I stopped walking to get a better look at the object, I realized that it wasn't moving, but rather drifting ever so slowly, and at times, it would remain stationary.  I stood staring at the object for a number of minutes trying to decipher what it was that I was looking at.  I thought to myself, is that a balloon?  I just couldn't figure out what it was that I was looking at.  It was just a sizable black object high in the sky, about the size of an aircraft, but shapeless.  It didn't make a noise, or have any lights, but it did seem to have a whitish hue or ambience to it at times.  After a number of minutes staring at the sky, I said to myself, I must look ridiculous, so I decided to move on, not to mention that my dog was ge! tting very impatient.  I probably wouldn't have thought much more about it, but what happened next is what dictated that I report it.  I looked away for only a second or two, probably took three or four steps, and then glanced back up at it, but it was gone.  It simply disappeared.  I immediately stopped again and stared in disbelief.  It was nowhere to be seen.  There were planes flying all over the place, but no black object.  I searched the sky for a number of minutes, but it was gone.  That's when I started to question the reality of what I just witnessed.  What did I see?  There has to be a rational explanation.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Glowing Object moving West to East in North Phoenix;2010-09-09 20:45:00;5-6 Seconda;Glowing Object moving West to East in North Phoenix Thursday, September 09, 2010 8:45pm  North Phoenix, AZ  I spotted an orange glow moving from West to East along the 101 Freeway in N. Phoenix.  Orange glow was spotted about 15 degrees west of my location moving easterly at high speed.  It disappeared at about 20 degrees above the horizon in about 5-6 seconds at what I believe was approximately 2000 to 3000 feet in elevation above my home.  No sound or shockwave was evident, no vapor trail, only the sound of chirping crickets. The sky was cloudless and winds calm.  As the object moved directly overhead the neighborhood dogs began barking as if startled and as soon as the object disappeared they stopped.  Airplanes in a pattern for Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport were plainly visible along with the outline of the aircraft and cross the pattern at about 5000 feet at 150 knots.  No outline was visible with the glowing object which I would describe as the glow of a toaster against a wall and not that of a nozzle of a fighter jet. I witnessed a similar object hovering in the same neighborhood about 2 weeks earlier then moving to the north at a very low altitude and speed as it disappeared behind a home.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Purple light dances around sky while disappearing  and reappearing.;2011-12-24 23:00:00;15 mins.;purple light dances around sky while disappearing  and reappearing. Around 11:00 pm we were called outside my mothers home by my brother-in-law to see a suspicious purple sphere moving vertically, horizontally, and in what seemed to be a figure 8 pattern.  It continued to do this for 15 minutes.  Then a helicopter which appeared to be a military helicopter showed up from the north and the object dropped in altitude and very quickly headed east.  While the object was in site it would remain visable for a minute or so then disappeared and re-appear in  a different location. We did take photographs  of the object and upon zooming in we see a few different things.  In one picture when zoomed in the object is a purple (like the purple from a black light) circle (kinda looks like a blood cell under a microscope) there is a light purple haze around the object.  In another the object is the same color but is long and narrow in the front and has spheres at the rear.  I've never seen anything move how this object moved and then for it to t! ake off when a helicopter came near seemed strange.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Large bright star-like objects that seem to seek out a property and change position with a person's movement.;2012-08-05 02:00:00;02:00 to 05:00;Large bright star-like objects that seem to seek out a property and change position with a person's movement. Dear Sir or Madam:  I am contacting your office to report what might be UFO activity, if not some kind of cyber villain activity.  At the location where I work I have been observing something that I feel is very much abnormal and should be seriously looked into.  During the past month or so I have been noticing 2 large and exceptionally bright star-like objects appear in the sky coming from the Northeast direction.  This occurs between about 3 – 5 am.  Over the last 3 days it has been occurring between about 2-5 am.  Unlike other stars that are in the sky throughout the night, these objects change position in the sky with my movement on the ground.  No matter where I go I can see these objects from exactly the same angle.  Over the past several months I have been making this same observation but the star-like objects came in from the western sky and they usually remained in the area throughout the night.  I have considered the possibility of a private person with illegally obtained technology, attempting to harass and intimidate me and my coworker just to make himself or herself feel important.  However it has been recommended that I report this as possible UFO activity. When I make observations of unusual activity I usually have no doubt as to whether I am seeing what I think I am seeing, but I still attempt to confirm it by pointing it out to others.  My coworker said he has made the same observations and I have pointed it out to at least one other person who works in the area.  While making these observations I have never felt nervous or afraid that I was being pursued by UFO’s or Extraterrestrials.  What I have felt and still feel is mental distress from the belief that this is very abnormal and so far no one has given me any assistance whatsoever with understanding what this is. In the past I have contacted the Arizona Society of Astrologers, but no one has answered and attempted to assist in any way. Your attention and consideration will be greatly appreciated.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Huge fireball in Phoenix turns into two orbs that float and tumble to the ground;2012-10-12 18:55:00;5 minutes;Huge fireball in Phoenix turns into two orbs that float and tumble to the ground On October 12, my family and I were hiking North Mountain in Phoenix, AZ at 6:55pm. On our descent, I saw out of the corner of my eye a bight flash, and I dismissed it as lightning. Ten to 20 seconds later, I looked left, and due West, I saw a fireball in the sky.  Not a small meteor with a smoke trail (I've seen those too) -  This was fully on fire, and huge, much like a movie set. Once it hit the clouds, it blinked out.  Three seconds later, two very bright and disticnt orbs started free falling to earth from the spot that the metoer dissapeared, only not straight down.  It took 4 mins for them to reach the surface, after going this way and that, pausing, and circling down to the ground.  It was like the two orbs were dancing with each other on the way down. I've seen some pretty weird things in my life, but this was the most life-changing event of them all.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Phoenix 101.;2013-03-29 21:30:00;1 minute;Phoenix 101 Driving on 101 in Phoenix. Two very bright white lights appeared over the highway. At first we thought it wad a plane, but the object held position in the sky.  As our car drove under it all I could see was the two hovering lights parallel to each other suspended above.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Large, bright red ill defined light flying over then disappearing straight up.;2014-01-04 22:08:00;2 minutes;Large, bright red ill defined light flying over then disappearing straight up A reddish bright glowing object traveling from north to south initially, then going straight up and disappearing out of sight.  We were standing near 44th Street and Indian School in Phoenix when I saw it approaching from the north.  I at first though it was an airliner going towards Sky Harbor airport but it was to bright and glowing to be an airliner.  It traveled in a straight line at a constant speed towards us then when it was over us it went directly upward between the planet Jupiter & the star Pollux which were both clearly visible right overhead.  I am a pilot and am familiar with many types of aircraft but have never seen one that acted like this one. It was a clear night with no clouds and a partial moon.  The object gave off a fuzzy reddish light and seemed to have an underlying structure with some other smaller lights.  There were other aircraft visible in the distance at the same time and the police helicopter flew nearby about 15 minutes after ! the sighting.  It moved noticeably faster than the jets flying below 10,000 feet in the area and it made no sound.  I was not able to determine the altitude but it appeared larger than the airlines we frequently see flying over.  I got one photo with my iPhone which only showed an elongated light as it was ascending.  I would like to know if any one else witnessed the sighting.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Sighting of small white orbs high over Phoenix.;2016-01-13 16:20:00;12;Sighting of small white orbs high over Phoenix. While waiting for the light rail in downtown Phoenix, I looked up and saw a small speck (whitish dot) in the sky above but slightly northwest of Phoenix.  Altitude was hard to judge, but could have been from 15,000MSL to 50,000MSL(?) ((not knowing its true size, it is very hard to determine altitude.  But it was not low.  By my eyesight it looked as if it was one or two (or maybe three whitish dots).))   It did not move as an aircraft would, it stayed within a very small area within space. I took two pictures with my phone (not video though) and when expanded there showed three whitish orbs (very small) in two different formations.  This was all against a clear blue sky.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Faster than Mach 9.6 or almost 7,000 mph. WAY FASTER!;2016-07-28 09:00:00;1 minute;Faster than Mach 9.6 or almost 7,000 mph. WAY FASTER! I'm a 18 wheeler end dump truck driver, and on the 28th of July, I was at a land fill called Rio Salado.  Just south of the I-10 on 7th ave.  I had just got done dumping my load of concrete and was on my way out of the land fill.  I needed to ((use restroom)) first before I left the land fill, so I pulled off the haul road and got out of my truck ((deleted)) by the truck fuel tanks.   I was ((using toilet)) and I just looked straight up into the sky, while I was going, and I saw a incredible sight.  Right above me was a very strange looking contrail that was being produced but it was being produced so fast.  It was at a incredible speed.  WAY faster than Mach 9.6 or almost 7,000 mph.  I know most commercial planes fly about 500 miles a hour and produce contrails sometimes and you can see them because they fly so slow. Not this very odd contrail it was moving so fast it had to be 5 times faster than Mach 9.6 or almost 7,000 mph.  So I looked way ahead of the fast moving contrail and I saw it.  It was a black swept wing looking aircraft the size of a commercial craft like a 747 and the contrails that were coming out looked puffy and strange.  This craft was moving so fast FAST FAST it went from right above me to almost out of sight in less than a minute.  From one side of the sky to the other in 60 seconds or so.  Aircraft cannot fly that fast its impossible.   As it flew out of sight I saw two other contrails being produced bearing down on the fast contrail and you could see they were following the real fast contrail but could not keep up..  It was crazy!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Mysterious object in the Phoenix sky.;2016-10-21 23:50:00;8 minutes;Mysterious object in the Phoenix sky. I live in Phoenix Arizona.  I am an adult male, never used drugs in my life, non alcohol user, no mental issues and of sound mind and body.  I am the type of person generally speaking that has to see something with my own eyes, see it, touch it, taste it, feel it or witness something to believe it when it comes to things of this nature.  I am just an average Joe with above average street smarts and intelligence in the game of life.  Arizona is known for having high visibility and fosters the type of environment where things can be seen from a distance. I have never in my life seen anything like I did On Friday October 21st 2016 approximately 10:50pm.  I saw something in the sky in the northern part of the skyline when I was taking out my trash to my dumpster.  What drew my attention to it was the light it emitted and how it moved.  The light was all one color and of a white light clear in nature.  This was a flying object in the sky that moved like nothing I have ever seen in my lifetime.  This was not something of commercial or military aircraft in nature.  If it was one of ours it was of discrete nature or kept very secret. I have seen stealth bombers and fighter jets in person and this was NOT one of those.  I have never in my life witnessed anything of this nature previously.  I used to laugh and have doubt at people that claimed to have seen things of this nature and were so adamant about it.  My opinion now has changed after what I witnessed. The way this thing moved laterally side to side was like nothing I have ever seen in my life.  I will never forget that aspect of it. It was THAT fast the horizontal/lateral movement was just unreal.  I stood and observed this thing in the sky for about 6 or seven minutes.  I saw one of our aircraft approach it.  I knew it was one of ours because it had red and blue lights and moved entirely different from how this thing moved.  When our aircraft approached it whatever it was I saw disappeared in an instant. I checked online and on the news and there was nothing about this reported that I am aware of.  Someone knows something about this as it was investigated by our aircraft approaching it.  Another piece of the puzzle is that Luke Air Force base is close to where I live and also we are really not that far from an installation known as Area 51.  What I saw was not something created by mankind.  Again, if it was it was something kept very discrete and secret.  That is all I have to say about it.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
2 large objects with many much smaller objects floating in the sky over Phoenix Sky Harbor airport;2017-03-14 06:45:00;5-10 minutes;2 large objects with many much smaller objects floating in the sky over Phoenix Sky Harbor airport Walking east in a parking lot at Salt River Drive and Priest in Tempe, AZ, then looked towards Sky Harbor and noticed 2 large objects with multiple, much smaller objects around them.   The person with me also saw these objects and neither of us could determine what the objects were.  There were flashes from the smaller objects that were quite random and appeared to be reflections of the sun light. The objects appeared to be moving in a North, northwest direction, and behaving much like a balloon.  It was very hard to make out the shapes but the 2 larger objects appeared almost diamond shaped while the smaller objects were just dots.  The objects seemed to have a reddish color. I had to enter a building and by the time I was able to get to a higher floor, about 5 minutes later, there was no sign of the objects.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Daylight object in close proximity to Sky Harbor Airport;2017-06-07 08:20:00;40 seconds;Daylight object in close proximity to Sky Harbor Airport I was operating a sound system (mics and speakers) for the groundbreaking of a new Valley Metro light rail station at 50th St. and Washington in Phoenix, serving the Ability 360 Center.  This location is almost exactly one mile from the eastern end of the north runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, runway 26.  The event was taking place on the roof of the three story facility.  There is a shade structure running along the north and west portions of the roof.  A 20'x20' canopy had been erected to provide shade for the guests.  My position was near the northeast corner of the roof where I had a small audio mixing board set up.  At that time aircraft were departing Sky Harbor to the east, from the north runway, passing less than a half-mile from my position. 	The event had begun at 8am with the Phoenix Mayor discussing details of the project.  At 8:20am, I noticed an object come into my field of view from the north, just above the Mayor's position at the podium, at a bearing of about 310 degrees.  It was elongated in the horizontal direction, reflective or very light in color.  I could not judge distance, but felt that it might be about a mile away, based on having witnessed countless aircraft approaching Sky Harbor.  I appeared to be similar in size to a small FedEx single engine turboprop aircraft which utilize Sky Harbor.  Its altitude was lower than that of an aircraft crossing over, so I immediately assumed it was making an approach, but it should have been much further west if that were the case.  I could not detect any vertical structure such as a tail, the reflective brilliance made it difficult to make out details. 	It continued south for a short distance then suddenly either came to a complete stop or made an immediate “jog” toward the west.  At this point the idea of “drone” popped into my mind, but the apparent distance to the object made it questionable if a drone would be that visible.  The other reason to reject the drone theory was the proximity to Sky Harbor.  The object then continued making a fairly rapid arc toward the southeast, again with an immediate acceleration which seemed very “drone like.”  I lost sight of it behind the canopy until it emerged southwest of my position.  It appeared to be following the departure path of  runway 25, the center runway, toward the east, but more rapidly than a traditional aircraft. I continued to observe it for another 10 seconds until it moved behind a large structure on the roof.  I moved to the other side of the structure but I did not see the object again. 	I could not detect any noise from the object, at least nothing which I could hear above the traffic on Washington Street and the PA system I was operating.  The movement was unlike normal aircraft in the sudden acceleration and deceleration.  The object's altitude seemed constant. 	Based on the flight path I observed I would dismiss any thought of it being an actual drone.  My immediate reaction was thinking “how bold” to venture into the departure path of Sky Harbor in broad daylight.  I have almost 40 years of working in close proximity to Sky Harbor Airport and am very familiar with aircraft and aircraft operations.  This object did not operate by normal flight standards.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

It caught my attention because it appeared mighty low and was not ascending or descending...it was just hoovering.

5 or more orange bright craft Phoenix 02/09/20;2020-02-09 19:45:00;10 minutes;5 or more orange bright craft Phoenix 02/09/20 Yesterday evening, February 9, 2020, around 7:45 pm, a bright orange light caught my peripheral vision, out of the window. I was watching tv, sitting on my bed facing roughly west and window is roughly south to my left. The room I am in is a little uniques in that it’s built on top of my patio, has an exterior only entry and has “no house around it”, ie I am surrounded by windows. When I first saw this orange glow, that it looked so much like the orange and light of fire, I thought I might be looking at a paper lantern. I followed it as it went in a generally northwest direction. I saw it through a small window on the east side of this room. I took a picture of it through my window and screen and the orange is visible in this photo. Less so in the others and 3 second video. I raced outside, naked mind you and with my phone and it’s still proceeding in same nw direction and then I see another coming along after. This continued for a total of 5 maybe more. Each one a very vivid orange, no visible fuselage, wings, red, green, white or strobing lights, and as bright as fire. But no flames. Also no engine noise. I took 2 other photos, one of which the shape of one is like a perfect capsule, but in the vertical. It is my intention to get the Center the 3 photos and 3 second video (!) but I lack technical expertise and it may take a bit! I thank you for speaking with me and for accepting this report. I sure would love to learn what it was I saw.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Star looking ufo in sky starts to move then dim out and get brighter;2020-04-12 01:00:00;5-7 minutes;Star looking ufo in sky starts to move then dim out and get brighter I came home roughly at 1:00 Am on the 12 of April so the first hour of Easter Sunday.  I get out of my car, (I’m always staring at the sky the stars more specifically I go outside and smoke and just stare and even take picture of some stars) at this time I’m sober and haven’t smoked yet and I notice this very bright star off to the north east and I go around the back of my car pull my stuff out of the trunk to go inside but again once I started walking inside it caught my eye and had my attention again.  it looked unlike the others and was a bit brighter that’s when it started to move north mind you this whole time it had not moved at all and now it starts changing in brightness so I put my stuff down and start recording.  It is very hard to see on camera but you can see it gets brighter and then dim out to nothing but not like a normal light on a airplane that strobes this was actual diming kind of like it was turning invisible and then it looked as if it had a big blue force field around it and started drifting north again until it was out of site I actually put my stuff back in my trunk and got on the i17 going north to try and capture it on camera again moving but had no luck.  I drove around until the 2:30 am it had blown my mind my life stents have recorded something similar years ago coming home from the casino late at night.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
