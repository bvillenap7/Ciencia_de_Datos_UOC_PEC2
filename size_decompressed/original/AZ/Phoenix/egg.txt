Eggshape In the Night Sky;2004-03-19 23:10:00;1 minute;Egg-shape In the Night Sky Was walking home from my nightly walk with a friend at appx. 11pm from Camelback Road heading South Bound on 12th street towards Indian School Road.  Seen A Egg Shaped Oddly lit object in the sky.  Had a hint of red and mostly blue-ish-green to the craft.  The craft seemed to catch our eye and appear out of nowhere and disapearred to the West in a matter of seconds.  I have never seen anything man made move this fast, And I am positive it was to low to be a satelite. ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports, submitted in rapid sequence, from the same computer.  We do not know if the reports are serious, or whether they are intended to hoax.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Three bright orange orbs pass by separately, one after the other.;2014-05-18 20:50:00;5 minutes;Three bright orange orbs pass by separately, one after the other. While the wife and I were watching TV, our son called us out to the back porch to see a large orange orb flying about 40 degrees off of the horizon north of us, flying from northwest to northeast.  The altitude was probably 500-1,000 feet, and the speed around 75 miles per hour.  It was slightly egg shaped, but more round than an egg.  It glowed bright orange, and it looked like a small version of the sun.  It moved silently away to the Northeast.  Range was less than a half mile and probably more like a 1/4 mile as it passed by us.  My wife, my son, and myself all saw it.  I went in to get a camera and while inside my son saw a second one pass by, slightly farther away.   As it passed by it dropped off a smaller version of itself, that slowly descended to the ground. Only my son saw this one as it was a distant dot by the time I got out.  But right at that time, a third orb approached from the northwest again, on about the same path, but closer than the first two.  This one was less than 1/8 mile away, and you could clearly make out the slightly egg-shaped form, again glowing orange, looking like a small sun.  The speed was again probably 75 mph, maybe a bit more this time.   My wife also witnessed this object.  There were multiple normal aircraft small and large visible in the sky at the time.   Fumbling with my camera in the dark I didn't get it focused and taking pictures until it was well over a mile away, but using the zoom feature, I got four decent pictures.  The image I will attach is a collage of those four pictures, reading in chronological order from top left, to top right, to bottom left, to bottom right.   There was a slight greenish color to the bottom of the orb by the time I got the last picture.  All objects moved silently past.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
A large flagellated bug, the size of a house, silently floating around Phoenix.;2015-06-29 00:30:00;6 seconds;A large flagellated bug, the size of a house, silently floating around Phoenix. After dozing off to sleep while sleeping outside on my back, I suddenly awoke to see a massive object descending toward me from above.  It appeared  half the size of my outstretched hand until it reached its closest point, then appearing the full size of my outstretched hand held at arm’s length from my body.   The object seemed to be the size of a large house or larger.  It was not illuminated (and appeared dark in color with some irregular features that seemed to reflect light) but seemed to be a large creature of some sort (resembling a beetle as seen from below).   It also appeared to resemble a dark colored octopus as seen from below, but with tentacles much shorter (each only a quarter the thickness of its body) and more wirery than those on an octopus.  The ‘tentacles’  (approximately ten or twenty located around its periphery), in fact were more like the cilia of a cell seen under a microscope.  These ‘cilia’, flagellated and shivered rapidly as if being rapidly blown by an erratic wind, yet the sky was very still (with no wind) and the object made no noise that I could hear (as a loud commercial jet was taking off from a nearby airport the moment I awoke).  The object had a highly organic look, as if it were a creature (maybe a large bug) of some type.   After I’d watched it approach for about two seconds, I yelled thinking that it may crash into me.  The moment I yelled, it abruptly changed direction (without slowing down) and began moving away and to my right.  As it ascended to the right and away from me, it slowly faded away and vanished.   The entire encounter lasted approximately five to six seconds.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
2 fast low flying planes follow point of light in sky over east valley in Phoenix;2016-11-15 20:00:00;30 seconds;2 fast low flying planes follow point of light in sky over east valley in Phoenix At 8pm, over east valley of Phoenix Arizona near the Wrigley Mansion - East Lincoln by the foothills before 32nd - 2 very swift moving identical planes/jets (dark out but assuming identical due to exact marker light placement on both) in tight formation following what can only be described as what looked like a star in the sky, a small point of light.  Even so, this was very close to the ground and low flying, so whatever the 2 planes were following was extremely small with no identifying features - just like a fast moving star. Chase planes kept in formation as they went into a valley and over a hill and one of the planes started flashing a red beacon while the other did not. The dot of light they were following remained the same, appearing to slightly fade out at one point but then brighten again. Currently watching for any reports to see if anybody else saw this!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Im an cardiographic technician or ekg tech so im use to looking at small details. I seen a very small white egg shape flying very fast across the sky.  As usually questions popped in my head as to what it was.   Then i grabbed my phone and took pics fast cuz it was moving so fast.  Then it stopped and shot straight up into space.  No way could that been anything but a ufo.  And i never believed in ufo's til now.  There was no sound and it was changing shape.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
