30 lights in a perfect line heading from nne sky to sse horizon over phx. az. at 615 am on 12/12/2019;2019-12-12 06:15:00;approx 10 min;30 lights in a perfect line heading from nne sky to sse horizon over phx. az. at 615 am on 12/12/2019 I saw the first light as it came into view in the N.N.E sky . It was a light ,I thought it may have been the ISS. I have witnessed this before , Usually I would watch the light pass over until it vanished in the SSE sky , then go inside to the computer to check my sighting . This morning however the lights kept on coming . They were spaced apart and formed a line . I thought maybe satellites or possible commercial flight path but they kept on coming . I then thought military but they kept on coming . There were two instances when there were two lights moving parallel with each other . they all were moving in a perfect line perfectly spaced . I counted at least 30 .;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
