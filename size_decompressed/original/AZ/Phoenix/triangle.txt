V shaped object that flew from the north of phoenix and eventually right over phoenix 3/13/97;1997-03-13 20:00:00;20-30 min;V shaped object that flew from the north of phoenix and eventually right over phoenix 3/13/97 I was sitting in my jacuzzi on the evening of March 13th, 1997.  It was sometime between 7:30 and 8:30 P.M..  My recliner seat in my jacuzzi at that time faced the north.  I could see planes coming in from the northwest every couple of minutes which I assume were coming in from Las Vegas and they still fly that same pattern today.  As I was looking what would be due north I notice 5 lights heading straight this way as if they were following I-17.  I was thinking I was going to see maybe the concord. The lights were not real high off the horizon when I noticed them.  I set an watched them coming in anticipation to see what they are.  At a distance they looked like they were in a straight line.  As they got closer they gained in altitude gradually and I could see a V formation.  There is a tree in the lot behind my house that they went behind for just a few seconds.  When they got on the south side of the tree I was amazed at how they had even gotten higher in the sky.  The lights never broke there V formation.  I could see that this was one object of an enormous size.  The lights flew directly over Phoenix while gaining altitude at an accerlerated speed.  I watch the lights along with my Mom and cousin Katy.  As the lights gained in speed and altitude the craft made a straight angle turn with no curve in its turn.  It was simply amazing.  I have seen footage over the years and only one  video showed the same object or one similiar to what we seen.  The lights that supposedly appeared down in south phoenix I do believe were flares.  The object I witnessed was flying and had no sound at all.  It is way to big for any aircraft that we as the general public no of.  I do not know much about the other lights in south phoenix but I wish they would debunk them and focus on the huge craft that actually flew from the north and over the city of phoenix.  I saw the video of the lights that were over Phoenix last night[4/22/08.  At first they resembled the lights I saw however the front light was not there and that video showed the lights moving towards and away from each other so I know it was not the same object I saw in 1997.  The object I witnessed had fixed lights on it and they looked the same in roundness from any direction you looked at them.  When I was a kid my brother and I have one other sighting I would like to talk or write about but at this time I would like to know more about the object that flew over !

UFO over Phoenix 1997;1997-03-13 20:00:00;5 minutes;UFO over Phoenix 1997 I just saw the show on tv called UFO over Phoenix or something similiar speaking about flares from airplanes.  I lived around 35th ave and deer valley at the time and was 16-17.   I was jokingly looking through a cardboard telescope I had made at the sky when I saw the v shaped UFO.  If I recall the lights looked red, not sure if they even were testing stealth bombers at the time.  I for a fact saw the v shaped lights and saw it very slowly fly over my house.  It was also completely silent.  I pointed for my mom to look and she saw it also.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

It passed over head and diasppeared into the south east horizon in about 10 to 15 minutes. The object was first spoted by ((name deleted)) at approximately 2015 on 3/13/97.  The object was seen on the northwestern horizon.  It appeared as a horizontal line with a red glow.  We arrived home and got some binoculars to see what it was.By this time it had changed color to a brilliant white and was in the shape of a triangle.  The best discription at this time was the leading edge of the B2 bomber.  A light on the nose, one on either side and toward the back, then one moreon either side spaced farther back than the first pair.  There were five lights in all.  The object moved from the northwest to the southeast, almost directly over head of our house.  As it moved across the sky is believe I was able to seethe stars between the light formation.  We tried to hear a sound from the objects, thinking it might be helicopters flying in formation, but there was no strobe or red and green marker lights.  The formation of the five objects did not changeas you would expect from aircraft.  There was no change in spacing, no noise and it was as bright overhead as it was comming or going.  We could not tell how high the objects were, but while discussing what we saw the next day we realized thatwe might have see these objects while they were over Prescott because they started out red then changed to white while over Phoenix.  We do not have any explanation for what we saw, but we both saw something we've never seen before.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

We always look in the sky when were outside at night and I had just went in the house and sat down at the computer. I didn't even touch the keyboard when she was hysterically yelling for me to come outside.  I ran outside as quickly as I could because I thought there was something happening to her. She pointed into the sky and told me to look at these lights.  It was clearly obvious that it was a craft of some sort. We could see the area between the lights which had a tiangular shape, was solid and was a different shade (darker) of black than the night sky.  It moved towards Sky Harbor airport as it moved away from us. It made no noise as it went by.We are in the flight path of Sky Harbor and look at the planes as they go over (about 5000 feet).

Another report on the Phoenix lights, but every prospective is important to get the whole picture and or map the object as it decended ;1997-03-13 20:30:00;3 min.;Another report on the Phoenix lights, but every prospective is important to get the whole picture and or map the object as it decended on Phx. On March 13,1997, I decided to walk my small dog in the neighborhood, it was a nice evening,I walked NE, then back SW back toward my home. I was at the corner of Ramuda and the block behind my home when I somehow became aware of many lights coming toward me very slowly and deliberately.  They were red in color and not too bright but low, very low to the ground coming right towards me.  At first I thought,oh it's helicopters from the airforce base or something.  The lights were in a v shape but a very wide or fat v.  I saw 4 lights that seemed to be evenly apart and one lagged behind, uneven compared to the rest.  As they got closer still, I was acutley aware that this wasn't just helicopters                     because they were close, low and no sound could be heard from them at   all.  I just stood there in total awe.  Even the dog seemed to be aware  of this object or objects.  The object changed altitude right in front  of me, I tried to see stars throught he middle of the lights but saw  none.  As the object moved away it turned toward the west from coming  south and west. As the object changed direction,I could only see 3 lights,still red in color. It also changed speed.  I live in North  Phoenix in a subdivsion called Tatem Highlands closest crossroads being      Tatem and Jomax.  Many of my neighbors walk dogs late at night, however I seemed to have been out alone this particular night.  There were three folks I yelled at immediatly after the object moved away from me, but they didn't seem to understand what I was saying.  My husband is an astronomy teacher and poohed,poohed me when I told him what happened.  Of course the next day when the story was in the news, he seemed more interested.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Unexplained Arizona Sighting;1997-03-13 20:45:00;3 minutes;Summary : Unexplained Arizona Sighting At approximately 8:45PM I went the front yard of my Phoenix home which is located in the southern part of the city, an area called Ahwatukee. I looked to the east and saw a very strange looking craft flying (?) very slowly in the sky. It was moving away I assume as it was getting smaller. It was very visible against the Superstition Mountains. It moved slowly from north to south and back again in what appeared to be a ric-rac pattern. It was quite large, I agree with the others who put their arm up and measured with a closed fist. It appeared triangular in shape, I related it to a squashed pyramid. I saw three very bright white lights, one in each corner and one at the top of the  pyramid.  In the center was a very, very bright pulsating red light, bigger in circumference than the three white lights. I would describe the white lights as three powerful strobe lights. We watched the object for several minutes and we amazed that something that large could move so gracefully! and so silently. We could hear no sound at all. It gradually faded into the south east sky.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

It was metallic and had reddish orange lights on it and made absolutely no noise, then shot off and disappeared After work on July 11, 1997, my friend and I witnessed 1 huge triangular shaped, metallic object with a V cut out in what appeared to be the tail end move directly above us with several reddish orange lights on the bottom of it. It moved a a slow, but steady speed. 25-30 mph? and made NO noise or vibrations, then shot off and disappeared abrubptly. We were sitting on our car at Vista Point at the Lake Pleasant Harbor scanning the skies for meteors as I often do, and relaxing after a day of work.

Three witnesses at the same location as the March 13t;1997-07-23 20:25:00;1 minute;Summary : July 23, 1997 8:25 PM Phoenix AZ/ 9822 N. 16th Place Looking west, then north. Three witnesses at the same location as the March 13th sightings.  We saw a rounded triangle-shaped object totally black against the lighter sky. Within 300 feet. Object could have been 100 ft in diameter. There was a faint glow on each side of it. July 23, 1997 8:25 PM Phoenix AZ/ 9822 N. 16th Place Looking west, then north. My background is that myself and my family saw the extraterrestrial craft of March 13, 1997 fly directly over our house.  Our family was featured in the USA Today article on June 18, 1997 and then on various TV programs. 	I had been sitting in my back yard with my son-in-law Danny Pasqualini and grandson Adrian.  We had been talking about the March 13th sighting and then the return of the craft on June 25th.  We were trying to understand where did the people on the craft come from?  I told them about a outline of a story I wrote in 1966 which could possibly explain where these people were from. I recounted the story of Windsloop, a man living at some time after the destruction of the world. At one point in the story he is captured by extraterrestrials.  Everyone thought the world had been devastated by the gods and the world was only now in its feudal stage.  There was no real science or technology nor people that could operate technology. We find out that right before the destruction, an armada of space ships left the earth with scientists and mechanics and technicians and scholars etc.  They knew destruction was coming and they wanted to preserve civilization.  They travelled for ove! r 100 years and arrived at an earth-like planet. They prospered and developed for 300 years and finally developed faster-than-light travel.  They immediately sent scout ships back to earth and found it devastated.  They built a huge ship, over 1 mile in diameter filled with everything they would need to resurrect the earth and its people. Windsloop ends up joining up with the returnees and agrees to be an agent for rebirth of the planet earth. Right after I finished the story and we stood up, and looked to the western sky, where the sun had gone down while we had been sitting there. Out of nowhere we saw an object moving through the sky west of us, perhaps 500 feet away and up about 200 feet. It was solid black and had a rounded triangular shape. The first thing we noticed was its absolute silence.  At first we thought it was a balloon, but after watching it for 10 seconds or so we knew it was not a balloon. Its movement was too deliberate and too rapid to be a balloon! .  It was moving diagonally from the southwest to the northeast directly in front of us and then passed us on the north side of my property heading slightly northeast until we lost it in the darker eastern sky. It almost seemed to fly out at 300 feet around the edge of my property first on the west side then on the north.  It made absolutely no sound at all at any time.  We had just seen a small plane come from the west towards us and we could here its engine from a couple of miles away. This thing passed within 300 feet of us as it passed by us on the north side of my yard. It's altitude over the area was only about 200 feet up but as it headed northeast it went higher. It was completely black against the dimly lit background sky and it seemed to have a slight glow on either side of it towards the rear.  The glow seemed to come from the other side of the object as if there was a light source of some kind on the other side of the object and it was bleeding over the edge so ! it could be seen just as an edge glow, slightly reddish and yellow on each side. From that view it seemed this object was facing its bottom away from us as it went around us. Its profile seemed almost spherical but more oval at the leading end, so it almost seemed like a very rounded triangle with the point leading and the glow on both sides of the base end. We all were astonished because there was no earthly explanation for what we had just seen. Danny was saying what the heck is that?  I said What do you think it is? Its a flyover by one of those craft. What else could it be?  And we were even more astonished because we had just been talking about the visitors and where might they have come from.  For the three of us, it was not a coincidence that this UFO showed up at that moment.  It was a verification for us that there are people on these craft and they are deliberately letting us see them, and that they were here at God's behest to help mankind.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
triangular craft with three red lights sighted in western phoenix;1999-06-15 21:30:00;2-3 Minutes;triangular craft with three red lights sighted in western phoenix I was taking the trash out at about 9:30 at night. I looked up to see what stars etc. Were currently visible, and i saw two red lights about two fist lengths apart, right overhead. At first i thought it was a couple of airplanes, but they were moving in perfect harmony, and had no blinking lights. I then saw a fainter, less red light, about 3 or for fist lengths from the other two, forming a triangular shape with the other two. I thought i could almost make out the outline, but there was no moon, and the sky was incredibly dark. I watched it for about 2 minutes, until my vision got blurry from eyestrain, so i closed them for a few seconds, trying to rest them, and when i looked up again, the thing was gone. A few minutes later i saw a shooting star in the west. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

On Oct.19 2001, Phoenix Az.;2001-10-19 20:45:00;15 seconds;On Oct.19 2001, Phoenix Az. I was sitting out side of the shop I work at and was having a cig. It was about 8:45pm, I was waiting to close the shop at 9:00pm. Watching the sky which was hazy but clear enough to see stars. There was a light layer of clouds coming from the west out of California. I suddenly caught a glimps of somthing flying over my head. I looked up to see a group of three reddish/orange, some what bright yet fuzzy looking lights flying at what seemed to be couple of hundred feet above my head but completely silent. It travel at a very fast speed from east to west in the direction of Luke Air Force Base. It travel from above my head all the way across the sky to disappear over single story house across the 30 foot wide alley behind my shop. This took a total of about 6 to 8 seconds, just long enough for me to jump out of the chair i was leaning back in and shouted what the hell is that. My receptionist looked out the door and said what, what?! Just as it was passing over the top of the roof of the house. Then another person I work with ran out the back door and was asking what I saw. I was describing it to her and all of a sudden a boomerang shaped cloud traveling the same direction east to west, was moving across the sky at an extremely fast speed too. The other clouds that were in the sky never changed,they were in the same place as they were when the event started.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

My husband (a Phoenix firefighter) and I observed two massive, triangular-shaped objects from approximately a mile away. The objects appeared to be just above the horizon and were hovering over a casino parking lot, which is located south of South Mountain. Each object had three circular, amber-colored lights (one at each corner of the triangle). They were hovering in a wing to wing formation (their lights created a W)and seemed to span across a huge parking area. We observed this for approximately one minute. We turned away for 15-20 seconds, looked back and they were gone! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Apr. 9, 04 Phoenix AZ a dark huge triangular shaped, noiseless object flew over my home heading due North;2004-04-09 21:50:00;30 sec;Apr. 9, 04 Phoenix AZ a dark huge triangular shaped, noiseless object flew over my home heading due North On April 9th at 9:50 pm my girlfriend and I were sitting in my backyard in Phx looking at the stars when she spotted something moving overhead. I didn't see it at first but then I saw the stars of Leo blink out as the object flew over. It was a black triangular shape that was maybe 1000' off the ground, and about 20 wide at arms length. It made no noise. As it passed directly overhead (heading due north) she noticed a line of dim orangish lights along the trailing edge. But they appeared to be more like exhaust ports than actual lights. We only saw the object for about 30 seconds. Both of us are avid amature astronomers and have witnessed a number of other sightings before. But nothing like this has ever been observed by either of us. I contacted Whiteman AFB 509th Bomber Div. but they told me they didn't have any Stealth bombers out that night over Phx. They told me I should contact Edwards AFB but they were of no help. Since then I have contacted Luke AFB but have not yet received a reply. This object moved at a moderate rate of speed but almost seemed like it was coasting in for a landing. Which is obviously not an option in my area.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Three white light and on small light;2004-09-01 03:00:00;30 mintues;Three white light and on small light On Sept 1st 2004 I was heading Back from Tucson Az to Glendale AZ on the I-10. At around 2:30 in the morning I seen a object that look like a car with its high beams on but only in the air. this strange looking craft had three headlights in the front and one small red light in the back. When me and my roommate pulled over, because of and accident we steped outside to look at the strange looking craft. what made it look strange was that the crafe was doing flip low to the ground. then would take off behind a building and then another craft would come out and do the same flip. both of the flying crafts were flying low to the ground and were not making any noise.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Triangle UFO with red and white lights over Phoenix AZ;2004-09-28 18:15:00;10-15 mins;Triangle UFO with red and white lights over Phoenix AZ We were driving on 60w going to 10w to 17n in downtown Phoenix to our hotel room. My fiance and I saw a HUGE triangle object hovering over Phonenix near the Phoenix Airport. The object had about 25-50 red LED style lights fading on and off slowly and on the tip of the triangle, there was a white light. On the other 2 tips of the craft there were also single white lights. There was no noise it was silent. It appeared to be hoving or moving at a real slow pace. There were 2 airplanes flying around the craft appearing to inspect the huge UFO. The planes looked like ants compared the huge craft. Because we were driving on the highway, we lost sight of it as we drove to 17 north to exit at dunlap ave in Phoenix az. Traffic on the highway appeared to take notice too as we slowed down to 55mph. A police car was next to us observing the UFO with us. We had our digital camera with us and was able to take photos and video of the UFO. Because it was night, the photos and video are blurry, but you can clearly make out the objects shape with the red lights hovering over Phoenix AZ. Unreal. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photos, and although they are ambiguous, they do look to be somewhat interesting.  Strangely, NUFORC has received no other report about the alleged event.

((POSSIBLE HOAX))  Three Huge Amber Orbs of light !!!;2005-01-01 23:00:00;10 Min.;Three Huge Amber Orbs of light !!! On the night of Jan/01/05 I was driving home from a friends house. It was around 11:00pm. The night sky was clear and full of stars. I looked to the left, out the drivers side window and saw Three HUGE amber orbs of light, totaly equidistant from eachother and in a triangle formation. They appeard to be perfectly still in the night sky.  I tried to focus on them as best I could while at the same time looking forward to watch the road.  The formation itself seemed to be 2-3 miles wide and the mass was fairly low to the ground.   After about 10 minutes they blinked out all at once, as if they vanished into thin air.  When I got home i tried to analyze what I had saw.  I took mental notes, NO sound even with window down at a red light, No blinking lights, No smoke, sparks, or downward movment. the were not flairs!  It was a sighting i will never forget.

Daytime sighting of three objects, in formation, moving across the sky, VERY VERY high compared to other aircraft.  No noises at all.;2005-11-16 17:50:00;10 minutes;Daytime sighting of three objects, in formation, moving across the sky, VERY VERY high compared to other aircraft.  No noises at all. AT dusk, approximately 5:50 PM, I was in the front yard, letting my dog snoop.  I was therefore wasting time, As I happened to look up, I saw what I originally thought were three helicopters approaching from the west.  I kept waiting for them to get closer and bigger, but even though they finally flew over, they never got bigger, I never hard any sounds, and they were MUCH higher than jetliners flying over either, into or out of the airport.  And even as they leave the airport, they are much higher than a helicopter. When an actual helicopter did actually fly over, then is when I realized these three items were WAY too high to be helicopters, as I had originaly wondered about.  One item, the front one, looked as if maybe it was a large rectangle item, and did turn 90 degrees a number of times.  Their fomation stayed consitent.  In the past, others have reported the sighting over Phoenix at night, and the lights.  This time, there were no lights, but the sun had not yet gone down. I am a man, aged 64, sane, and have never before believed I've ever witnessed UFO's.  This sighting was way too weird, and I can be certain they were not normal aircraft.  Even very high aircraft, you hear some noise, not this time, and no vapor trails.  Movement across the sky was steady, and rather slow.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

And i seen what looked to me as a moving star, so i kept an eye on it, and noticed two more of these Stars following at the same speed, making a perfect triangle. It moved at a pretty decent speed, and turned slightly i watched it until it disappeared behind the clouds. Was thinking if it could be some planes in formation, but decided it couldnt have been. Due to the fact that it stayed in a perfect triangle shape the whole time even while it turned, And the lights never blinked, they were a solid light, unlike planes, which have blinking lights...;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Rectangular Shaped 4 Red Lights Which All Blinked Out Within 18 Minutes;2008-04-21 20:15:00;18 Minutes;Rectangular Shaped 4 Red Lights Which All Blinked Out Within 18 Minutes At approximately 20:15, as I was taking out the trash, and walking back into my apartment, I glanced up at the sky, and saw a triangular shaped patter of 4 red lights, located in the Northwestern sky. At least one of the 4 lights was set slightly back from the others, making the triangle off just a tad. The lights were at the approximate height that any helicopter, or airplane getting ready to land or having just taken off would fly. There was absolutely no sound with the lights.  I walked back into my apartment to get my camera, thinking how odd that was. When I got back out, I almost did not expect the lights to still be there, but they were. It appeared as though the lights were moving very very slowly, because they had hardly moved at all. I attempted to take a picture, but was unable to get a good result.  At the same time I was trying to get the picture, two other people were walking to their car, and also saw the lights. Upon staring harder at the lights, it seemed as though they were moving very slowly in a Southeasterly direction. By this time, the 4 lights had formed a uniformed triangular shape.  As I watched, the furthest westerly light started blinking, and after a few seconds, blinked out. Then, the next light began blinking and also blinked out. Within seconds, the third light also began blinking, and then blinked out. By this time, the last remaining light had switched directions, and was now moving northeast.  As I watched the remaining light, there would be times that it would flash very brightly, and I caught a glimpse of a shape of something, but before I could define it, the light would grow dim again. It almost seemed, as if it were a rounded shape, like the nose of an airplane, but much larger. As I watched, the singular remaining light continued to move to the Northeast, and then it just stopped. It would still continue to blink brighter, allowing me to briefly make out the shape of something, but then it would grow dim again.  Within, 18 minutes of my first seeing the lights, the fourth and final light then blinked out. As I walked back into my apartment, I suddenly got chills, as if I had just seen or experienced something extremely important.  In the past, I have seen other strange sightings, including something similar a few months where there were three lights also in a loose triangular pattern. All three of those lights eventually blinked out as well.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Black triangle, 3 lights at each point,  thin in shape, hanging point down, turned clockwise, lights stretched and sped away;2008-08-05 22:30:00;2 Minutes;Black triangle, 3 lights at each point,  thin in shape, hanging point down, turned clockwise, lights stretched and sped away I was driving south on 19th Avenue, approaching Pinnacle Peak Road. Now, this is right near the Deer Valley Airport, but what I saw was not an airplane. I saw a triangular shaped craft that was inky, inky, jet black with 3 lights.  It was very ink-black against the dark sky and one could differentiate the fact that it was a much darker black than the night sky. It was VERY big and was hanging like a thin black mirror in the sky, point down. This was the second UFO I've seen in my lifetime, and this one made me feel very afraid.  I think because it was so large and so black. Next, the triangle began to rotate, with the point of the triangle going up and the other points turning in a clockwise motion. What was so strange is the lights of the triangle then began to stretch and the inky blackness of it dissipated and the 3 lights shot off quickly in separate directions. This was just northwest of the Deer Valley Airport. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
two craft objects seen, one horizontal in shape, the other triangular. And some flashing red orb shaped lights in the background;2008-10-26 19:40:00;30 minutes;two craft objects seen, one horizontal in shape, the other triangular. And some flashing red orb shaped lights in the background Ok, so the first sighting was a very large aircraft which headed towards me from the far distance which I at first thought was an unusually large star, but as it appraoched, I saw that it had lights, and then at the same time there appeared to be unusual background activity also going on in the sky. I saw flashing red orb like lights that seemed to almost come together and then moved quickly away from eachother, meanwhile, in between there appeared to be a falling star! Now, (and I know this sounds too outrageous), but while the large craft was meanwhile approaching overhead, and it seemed to be possibly a half a mile in width It had at the front of it a horizontal line of yellow lights, and at each end, two red lights. It flew overhead as I watched from my balcony, and was then out of view. I kept on trying to tell myself that it must have been an airplane, but I didn't know what the other orb lights were all about in the distance. And if that were not enough!!I then heard what sounded like another approaching plane or craft overhead, flying in the opposite direction heading towards the west valley, which was a huge, triangular shaped craft ( as I saw that it was indeed a solidly shaped triangular craft ) with maybe three lights. But as it was gliding over the valley away from me, it appeared to have onlt two white flashing lights, that then dimmed one the lights as the other light kept flashing on and off. I watched this craft until I could no longer see it gliding away in the distance. Now I have NEVER seen anything in the sky unusual except maybe a falling star only once in my lifetime. I have no idea what these were, but i reported the sighting to the ArizonaRepublic newsroom.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
The Phoenix Lights, 17 Years Later.;2009-03-15 22:00:00;~1 minute;The Phoenix Lights, 17 Years Later The Phoenix Lights 17 Years Later.   March 15, 2009, between 21:30 and 22:30 I-10 South of Phoenix, East of South Mountain.   I was driving back to my job in Tucson on Sunday night, (03/15/2009) from visiting my wife in Ontario, California.  I was driving on I-10 just south of Phoenix, east of South Mountain.   I saw the stars being blacked out by something huge (UFO) moving in the air.  A big rig truck a lane or two to the right slowed down and the driver leans forward to look up through his windshield.  Other drivers also slow down and look up.   I take my foot off of the accelerator to look up through the large front windshield of my 1983 Toyota Supra and see something big, black, slow and silent, couldn’t hear anything but the road noise of the cars and trucks on the freeway.  This “UFO” was moving from behind me (North) in a South-East direction.   I then noticed a small flare, bottle rocket or meteorite come from above the huge UFO and hit the leading edge of the left wing and break up into many small pieces.  It really looked like a lit meteorite hitting the leading edge of the left “wing” and then brea! king into many lit pieces.  I thought this was very strange that a meteorite would just happen to fall to hit this very unusual object as it glided over, a strange coincident indeed.   I was driving about 70-75 mph in that stretch of the freeway and the object was moving slightly faster over me in a Southeast direction.  I then thought the object which hit the UFO could have been a bottle rocked but I thought again about this because when it hit, it sounded like a pebble hitting something made of metal because it made a slight ringing sound.  I remained uncertain as to what I had observed as I completed my drive home to Tucson. The next day the incident was all over the papers but I still didn’t make the connection to what I saw because when I saw the UFO I didn’t see any Lights other than the “meteorite” which broke up when it hit the left “wing” and shatter into lit pieces.  The UFO was totally black, blocking out the stars as it passed but seemed to be slightly illuminated by the city lights below. Years later, I read people accounts stating that they felt no fear.  I recall that I also did not feel fear but more curiosity and confusion, like, What Is That??? I’ve seen large planes up close before, B-52, B-747, C-5, Hughes Aircraft Co.’s Spruce Goose, and the Space Shuttle, etc.  None can compare.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Three large orange lights / triangular craft, North-Central Phoenix;2012-06-07 22:28:00;5 minutes;Three large orange lights / triangular craft, North-Central Phoenix The object consisted of three large orange lights, formed in a rather straight line (although the center light seemed to be slightly lower the other two, but only by a hair). Though the lights were not visibly connected by any sort of discernible fuselage, I got the sense that they were each part of one singular craft. The distance between each light was equal. I also got a strong sense that this object was triangular, perhaps equilateral. Moreover, it was quite large much much larger than any aircraft I’ve seen before. The craft made no discernibly significant shifts in position, neither vertically nor horizontally. It just hovered. Situated over flat terrain, and above a heavily-populated, low-lying residential area, it hung in the night-sky at a relatively low altitude (much lower than planes departing from or approaching Sky Harbor). I was driving south on I-51 at 10:28pm. As I approached Shea’s exit ramp I saw what I thought was an extremely large (and normal) aircraft off to the west three large orange lights (what looked to be the lighted ends of each wingtip and nose). I passed the exit and soon lost my view of the object due to topography (a small mountain range just beside the road within northwest section of Phoenix Mountain Preserve, west side of the 51). Beyond this exit, I-51 makes a series of curves through the range. Coming around the last major bend (near Dreamy Draw), I gained sight of the object again. I thought it looked quite peculiar, but I almost wrote it off as nothing special. I continued to look at it as I came around the curve, and finally decided to pull off onto the shoulder to get a better look. Trees obstructed the view, but I could see two of the tree lights through the branches. I slinked over the center console into the passenger seat, pulled my binoculars out of the glove box, opened the passenger window, and saw that it was definitely no ordinary craft. Since the object looked like it was going to move out of the trees any moment, I waited for about 10 seconds before I grew impatient. I jumped out of the car (with the binoculars) and walked 15 ft up the shoulder (north), giving me a clear view of the object straight west. Three large orange lights hovered over north-central Phoenix. From where I was standing the object was almost eye-level, but slightly higher. Its distance was too hard to judge, but if I had to guess, I’d say it was roughly 500 yards away. Maybe more. This didn’t seem to be an ordinary craft because: 1) the lights on the craft were orange 2) given its distance from me, the lights on the craft were very very large (about the size of a racquet ball held away at arm’s length) 3) the punctuated distance of one light from another signified a wingspan significantly larger than any craft I’ve ever seen before and 4) It hovered (demonstrating no positional shifts). I heard nothing but the traffic of I-51, thus if any sound was associated with the object, it was not heard. I watched it for about 4 minutes. At one point the object seemed to be coming closer as the lights grew slightly larger. Then the object seemed to slowly retreat, as the lights got smaller and more defined (i.e. the edge of each light became much sharper, less hazy).  At this point I decided to try to exit the freeway and head west along Glendale to get a better look.  Being on a really unsafe section of the road, parked on a narrow shoulder, I decided I best be moving along anyway. As soon as I left the shoulder of I-51 I lost sight of the object. When I exited at Glendale, the object remained unseen as I drove west to central (about 3.5 miles) and decided to turn around and continue down the 51.  Either visibility hindered my ability to see the object, or the object was no longer present. Given the size, location, and duration of time the object was visible, I’d have a hard time believing I was the only one who saw this. I snapped a photo, but it is extremely blurry.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

I live in Central Phoenix, I was looking up at Moon, its location was straight up directly over my head.  I then noticed a starmoving I was looking to the East.  Then I noticed that the Star Was actually 3 separate lights in a isosceles triangle shape and appeared to be a HUGE craft.  I noticed many neighbor hood dogs where barking,   It was heading southeast and lights slowly dimmed as it moved away.   I didn't hear any type of propulsion or any unusual sounds coming from sky. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) No, I did not see any type of craft structure.  However, lights did all move together as one object!  Thanks for replying so quickly!    Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Huge triangle shape object travelling slowly in outer space over the skies of Phoenix, AZ.;2017-06-15 23:00:00;3-5 seconds;Huge triangle shape object travelling slowly in outer space over the skies of Phoenix, AZ. On Thursday June 15, 2017, the night was clear, so I decided to lay down on a pool recliner in the middle of my house backyard in South Phoenix, by 67th Ave and Lower Buckeye Rd, to watch the sky I had my Barska 20x80 Binoculars by my side.   The night was uneventful, and after 30 minutes of not seeing anything out of the ordinary, I was ready to get inside the house, and it happened, high up there, at 80° travelling slowly North-NorthEast it must have been in outer space, I noticed the spaceship because the bottom lights turned on and flickered for 3 to 5 seconds (the lights were like beams forming a V shape with a smaller v in the center, making the lights four beams), and then they went off since I believe the object was in outer space, it must have been huge in size I got my binoculars immediately, and looked for the object in the direction it but travelling I wasn't able to locate it anymore... I got so excited and shortly went inside the house to tell ! my wife...  This was the once in a lifetime sighting  Over time, I've witnessed other sightings, in the form of silver disc shape objects and silver orbs, but nothing like this...  This is a motivation to keep watching the skies. :);33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
I noticed a vee shaped object flying overhead.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-24 19:25:00;5 seconds;At 7:25pm on September 24th, I went outside to smoke a cigar,  I looked up at the sky to view the stars when I noticed a vee-shaped object flying overhead.   It was almost invisible, but the moon was low on the horizon and was blocking out the stars as it past.   It was completely silently flying at about 500 feet high.  It was about the sizes off a small plane.   I live in Phoenix, Arizona ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
