There was a bright flash and I saw a creature with huge dark eyes it was gone in a flash. I stood there in hysterics for a while my parents came in and my mom said i was gone. My covers on my waterbed were still tucked in.  I cannot account for those 4 hours. I was in a accident in 1996 the MRI showed metal then by CT on 10-13-19.  Both times Dr said there is a metal object of unknown composition in my brain.  I think it was entered through my right nostril.  Many things have happened throughout my life.  I'm willing to show you the scans.  Please help me.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

I was inside of a small building in the back yard of a friend's house. All of a sudden a huge BOOM occured: a very loud, tight-sounding explosion. We ran out of the building and saw nothing, but one of my friends had been sitting outside looking towards the East when the explosion happened. He said he was looking up at the sky behind the house and trees when all of a sudden a sudden super-bright flash occured and it seemed the whole sky turned bright white. All he could see was the brightness and the silouette of the house and trees Even the house lights were not visible because of the brightness of the sky. And then a split second later a loud boom occured. That was it. We never heard anything else.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Shooting star below cloud layer;2003-11-08 18:30:00;seconds;shooting star below cloud layer My wife and I were traveling south into central Phoenix on SR51, a freeway, to attend a sporting event, I was driving. Around the area of Cactus Rd. I noticed a flash in the upper part of the windshield, I believe there was a left to right motion to it, (east to west). As I leaned forward to see what had caused it, my wife said, oh, it was a shooting star. I told her that I doubted that because Phoenix had a solid cloud layer all day, and I had never heard of a meteorite still incandscent 8,000 feet,(est.), above the ground, traveling in a horizontal path. (I work for a large aerospace company and am an amateur astronomer.) As I told her this, she replied that she had seen a similar shooting star about a week before in the area of New River, a town about 30 miles north of Phoenix. She said it occurred early in the evening, while it was still very light, and, again, had been an overcast day. She said the shooting star disappeared from view behind the mountains north of New River. The details stuck in my mind because November 8th was my birthday. I also investigated several websites dealing with meteorites and found that smaller ones are usually only traveling a few hundred kilometers per hour that low in the atmosphere. If it had been one large enough to be incandescent at that altitude, it should have made a large hole somewhere in west Phoenix, but there was no report of any such event the next day. I have debated with myself for months about submitting this report, but I am a regular visitor to this website, and as such, feel guilty about not reporting, if only to add this to a database.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Lake Pleasant night time UFO sighting;2009-07-08 21:30:00;30 seconds;Lake Pleasant night time UFO sighting A friend and I were camping out by Lake Pleasant. We were in our sleeping bags looking into the sky in the bed of his truck, we noticed a set of stars in a triangular shape discussing the unusual shape of the stars we then noticed a bright flash covering the diameter of one of the corners. A white light then emerged from the star and began to streak across the sky making a zig zag like pattern. We followed the object by pointing at it and after aproximately 30 seconds the object turned back towards the corner of the triangular stars and faded. We were pretty shaken up by this and our hair was standing on end, we could barely sleep after that, very exciting.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Cluster of at least 6 unidentifiable brillant flashing red and while hovering objects.;2014-08-17 20:00:00;10 minutes;Cluster of at least 6 unidentifiable brillant flashing red and while hovering objects Around 8:30 PM on Sunday evening 8/17/14 I was in my bedroom which faces the east side of South Phoenix area, near S. Mountain.   When I looked out my window I saw what appeared to be a group of at least six separate very bright red, with light flashing, flickering objects, that basically looked like they were hovering, but then would move in different directions sporadically, flash, and then the lights would disappear and would reappear,again.  My first thought that they were commercial jets taking off from Sky Harbor or landing at the airport.  But, they (the unidentified objects) were stationary, hovering and the movement clearly wasn't any jet aircraft.   My only other thoughts were that they may have been a lot of helicopters,possibly hovering over an accident on the freeway area.   I alerted my adult daughter to go out into the backyard to see what she thought, and she thought initially maybe it was jet aircraft, but then came to the same conclusion that the ! objects were hovering, flashing off and on, and the movement couldn't be that of any commercial aircraft either.   After about 10 minutes of continued watching the objects, it got dim and then the objects just disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

A dark round object, then a bright flash of light trailing the sky.;2016-12-31 02:45:00;5-10 seconds;A dark round object, then a bright flash of light trailing the sky. I was outside watching the overcast in the sky early in the morning and remember thinking the clouds are the perfect cover for them to observe us without us noticing.  Not even a couple seconds later, I saw a dark, round object slightly lower from the clouds, and quickly shoot back into cover.  My eyes were fixated in the spot where I saw movement, cause I thought it was a plane or something.. and a few moments later, a huge flash of light trailed across the sky in the opposite direction that the dark object moved in.  The trail of light lasted for like two seconds and then completely disappeared.  No sound whatsoever.  The lights in the backyard were dimming in and out a little bit while all of this happened, but it was also storming that day, so it could have been from that as well.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Flash of light in the sky.;2017-01-15 20:53:00;2 minutes;Flash of light in the sky. Brother was driving me to work.  When approached 35th Ave Bell on the west side noticed a light flashing on the sky.  Almost like a plane except it wasnt moving.   I told my brother look at that light up there can you see it moving?  He said no its just sitting there, its probably a star.   Had to been like a minute in & then the light disappeared.  Not even a second went by before it reappeared & was bigger & brighter than ever.  It went from a speck of light blinking into a large flash & vanished.  Was amazing!!!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Streak of light ending with 3 objects flashing intermittently moving in the opposite direction for 5 minutes.;2017-08-04 21:15:00;5 minutes;Streak of light ending with 3 objects flashing intermittently moving in the opposite direction for 5 minutes. August 4, 2017 approx. 21:15 Phoenix, AZ   It was a clear sky, the moon was out and almost full, the temperature was in the mid to upper 90s. I was swimming in the pool, floating on my back looking at the night sky, when I saw what I thought was a falling star streak from the East-Southeast towards the West-Northwest, stopping short of the Big Dipper.  It struck me as odd right away, as it left behind a glowing trail something similar to what an old CRT TV would do when you turned it off in a darkened room.   Then, within 3 to 4 seconds, a bright light flashed, just outside of where the streak that was left by the “falling star” had ended.  That’s when I realized this was not a falling star.   For the next 5 minutes I watched, as this object and possibly two others, flashed intermittently with varying intensity from very bright quick flashes of white, to a dull slowly growing intensity, culminating in bright white, then instantly dark. During this time, the objects started moving to the East very slowly.  There was no pattern or timing to the flashing or the intensity.  The light was mostly white, but there was a bluish tinge to it at times.  It seemed to be 3 objects in close proximity to one another.  After about 5 minutes, the activity was no longer visible.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
