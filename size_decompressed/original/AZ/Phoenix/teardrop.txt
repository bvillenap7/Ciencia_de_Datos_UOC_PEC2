The moon looked like an orange fireball in the sky.  As we were watching the moon growing higher and higher into the sky, three dark, tear-drop ships went in front of the moon, moving from the west side of PHX the eastside of PHX. They did not look to be in our atmosphere, but between Earth and the Moon.  The Tear Drops filled a huge area of the face on the moon.  From the West to the East of the moon, the Tear Drops took about five seconds for them to pass from one side to the other.  The Spanish couple next to us had also witnessed what we did.  They pointed to the moon, rattled something in Spanish.  I went to talk to them but our English and Spanish were not working with each other to talk about what we had just witnessed.   It was amazing.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

15 or 16 yellowish white lights coming from the west formed a large X and held that position, ascended and disappeared .;2010-06-28 20:30:00;2 min;15 or 16 yellowish white lights coming from the west formed a large X and held that position, ascended and disappeared . Description of objects: bright white/yellow What they did: they came in first one, than another, then 3 ot 4, then 4 more, then I went to get my son ( 10 seconds) both of us went to where I was standing when I saw them.  Now there was an X formation in the western sky. they held that position for about 20 seconds and began to move off to the north.  They appeared to be rising and getting smaller as they went higher.  Then they were gone, just disappeared.  There was only one left and it slowly followed the direction of the others to the north and disappeared in the same manner. Description of the background: I was in my backyard which faces north Phoenix, Arizona.  One of my neighbors to the west has trees on the west side of their property, the other neighbor, west diagonally, has a palm tree.  I have a brick fence. The lights first came from the west emerging from behind my west neighbors trees on the west side of her property, they went past the palm tree in my other neighbors yard and when I came from the side of the house where I ran to get my son, the lights form the X that showed well past both sides of the palm tree. the lights were not moving.  Then a couple began to move and the rest slowly followed.  It looked slow but had to be really fast to go that far that quickly. I work for the state of Arizona in the Job Service Program and my son works at a computer software company compiling data for lawyers.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

One object moving right to left in the Northwestern sky at about a 45 degree angle was seen moving in a 45 degree angle downwards.  The object was bright orange and appeared to be on fire.  It then split into two independent objects both moving in the same direction stated prior. Shortly after both objects disappeared at the same time.  Ten to fifteen seconds later one of the objects reappeared moving in a 45 degree angle upwards. Soon after it disappeared completely.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
I noticed a very bright Blue-Green (like an acetylene flame) Tear shaped light coming towards the raised highway;2011-09-14 19:45:00;45 seconds;At 19:45 on 14SEP2011 a friend and I were travelling south on SR-51 in Phoenix, AZ.  As we were approaching and crossing over Thunderbird Rd, I noticed a very bright Blue-Green (like an acetylene flame) Tear shaped light coming towards the raised highway from the Northwest heading at a slight angle down and toward the highway.  I thought it might be a helicopter.   As we crossed over Thunderbird, I pointed it out to my friend and then it very quickly disappeared with a few small white balls shot out in front that quickly disappeared.    We both saw it disappear and looked for a bright light if it crashed but did not see one.    I donâ€™t know what it was.  It might have been a very large flare?;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Strange atmospheric event of tear drop shape travels west to east with incredible speed.;2015-11-19 17:03:00;7 seconds;Strange atmospheric event of tear drop shape travels west to east with incredible speed. At approx. 17:03 hrs., while standing outdoors, facing the west, I saw what appeared to be a clear balloon rising up into the sky, although when considering the shape of Earth, it may have simply approaching at a steady elevation and appeared to be rising, as the sun does. The object was small from my vantage point and I will compare size by Ie:  How an air plane would seem so small from 60-80 miles away in the evening when it's flood lights are on. You would see what appears as a tiny ball of light. This object traveled from the west and to the east at a high rate of speed, much greater than anything I've seen before.  If I were to stand with my face to the south, point my finger of my right hand to the approximate area where it first appeared, and point the finger of my left hand to where I lost sight of it, my hands would be at approximatelt, 2:50 PM if I were a clock.  I first thought it to be WT1190F  (The debris from the Apollo program, which was estimated to fall out on Friday, November 13, about noon Eastern time, over Sri Lanka, though no documented evidence of it having come down is found. I am going to assume this was some strange atmospheric phenomenon such as St Elmo's Fire or Lightning out of the clear blue sky.  I do not believe in space ships and aliens.   Thank you!  God bless.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Flying corkscrews.;2017-05-04 18:30:00;5 minutes;Flying corkscrews Looking to th east at about 2:00, I saw what I thought were to large birds moving south to north one behind the other.  They were to high to be birds (pterodactyls came to mind), so I went inside to get my binoculars.  What I saw was a cone shape but with a corkscrew row of lights that spun in a clockwise fashion as to propel the craft.  They were dark except for the lights.
