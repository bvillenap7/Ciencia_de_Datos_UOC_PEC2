Phoenix Lights?  Seen from the Air.  ((NUFORC Note:  Reported by a military navigator.  PD));1988-11-01 19:40:00;5 minutes;Phoenix Lights?  Seen from the Air. On approach to the Phoenix area from the northeast aboard 57-1465,  a crew member alerted me to ATC radio traffic concerning UFO activity.  Prior to this, and for several minutes, I noticed a pattern of whitish-yellow lights in line formation, with slight variations in altitudes, in the relative proximity of South Mountain.  They were visible for at least 40NM. Prior to hearing the radio traffic, I was under the impression I was seeing very bright lights coming from atop the mountain, as I knew there were horseback riding trails in the area.  I can account for seeing five lights as I remember they formed a shallow W-pattern similar to the form of the Chair of Cassiopeia, however this was in the southern sky and appeared below our altitude. ATC radio inquired if we saw the lights, which we acknowledged, and it was overheard that the lights were visible from other aircraft and from the ground. We turned to the north for an approach into Luke AFB and upon completion of that approach, turning toward the south, the lights were no longer visible. In later years, I was informed they were probably flares in the MOA to the south of Phoenix, however, I am familiar with air-dropped illumination flares, and although there are similar characteristics, these did not appear the same. This information is extracted from my log-book. ((NUFORC Note:  Reported by a military navigator.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Very High star-like dot of light, high speed, crossing sky, then abruptly 'shot' into space, faded out.;1989-11-10 23:00:00;10 seconds;Very High star-like dot of light, high speed, crossing sky, then abruptly 'shot' into space, faded out. These two events occurred in 1989 and 1995 respectfully (approximate) in Phoenix AZ.  I lived North of the city, pretty dark in those days. The first:  Facing South, a white, star-like solid light, like a medium size star, appeared in the sky very, very high up, at an almost-directly-overhead latitude and crossing the sky coming out of the East to West. I immediately thought it was a satellite. Way too high to be an airplane.  It was either already in space or just on the fringe. And faster than a satellite I was use to seeing. But just as I told the person I was with to look, it's a satellite, the object stopped crossing the sky half way, almost directly overhead, and literally stopped on a dime, and then went straight up into space, fading out.  It didn't continue across the sky like a satellite would and then instantly 'blink' out when it went into earth's shadow.  This object went straight up.  A 90-degree instant 'turn' up into space.  I verified this in my mind by acknowledging that it did not 'cross' any more stars in any direction. I'm a private pilot, university graduate and voluminous readings, I know of nothing that would act like this, particularly that it was so high to start with, traverse half the sky, and then abruptly stop and go into space and fade out, not suddenly blink out. Now here's the kicker:  about six years later, my wife and I were standing in my backyard, same house, facing North this time, looking up towards the horizon, not straight up.  I had told her my UFO story. Suddenly, There...I instantly knew it was the same 'object', probably because it’s so different then my ‘normal’. It suddenly appeared coming at us, from North to South this time, crossing the sky towards us at a very fast speed.  Both were traveling much faster then the satellites I've seen crossing the sky.  So, from first sighting it near the horizon to it going up into space took about seven seconds and then another two/three seconds as it faded out)   Without taking my eyes off of it this time, I told my wife, see the light coming at us?   Watch...it’s going to come almost overhead, stop, and then go straight up into space and fade out!   And it did just that as I was describing what it would do to her!!  Again, never went 'by' any more starts verifying that it did indeed go 'straight up' into space. And now I have a witness who's always with me (married). so now it's 'we' who saw it!  Ran across your article in the SOCO Magazine here in Boston MA and thought I'd send you this 'tale'.  I've seen rockets launched in the Air Force (I worked on Minuteman Missiles), saw the shuttle launch in Fla., a missile 'blowup' just after launch in New Mexico (from our backyard in Phx) leaving the colorful contrails from the rising morning sun, we've seen satellites, the shuttle, the space station (as I acknowledged, they cross the 'entire' sky then suddenly blink out when they go into the earth's shadow) but I’ve never seen anything this high in the sky, just a 'bright' dot of a light, that initially looked like a satellite but traveling much faster, stop on 'a dime', and go straight up into space and just fade out. Any ideas as to what these/this could have been? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Green, almost neon color, rainy night, stationary object;1995-02-15 20:00:00;20+ minutes;Green, almost neon color, rainy night, stationary object It was in Feb. of 95 on a rainy night, clouds fairly low, saw a green, almost a neon green blob in the southern sky. I dismissed it as the result of a static discharge from an airplane, as Sky Harbor isnt too far off. I have since wondered, as it was stationary, and continuous, it was something more. since hearing you on the Art Bell show, i got the nerve to report it. My wife saw it too, but would probably not remember, as she doenst care about those things. I didnt see an object, just the light.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Star like UFO seen by hospital security flying around Boeing 737 in Phoenix Arizona.;1996-08-20 20:30:00;1 minute;Star like UFO seen by hospital security flying around Boeing 737 in Phoenix, Arizona I am an 18 year veteran security officer with a local hospital here in Phoenix Arizona.  I was in my first year of working for the hospital.  I was working the night shift between 4 PM and midnight on the above estimated date and time. I had pulled my patrol car over to make an entry into my daily activity log.  It was a clear summer night with not one cloud in sight.  Airport traffic was coming in from the north to north west area and landing in from the east of the airport at sky Harbor international Airport. I am an aviation enthusiast and sometimes I look up into the sky to look at aircraft as they fly by.  I noticed in America West Airlines Boeing 737 fly into Skyharbor from north west of Phoenix.  I had pulled my vehicle over facing north along 10 Street and Brill Street which is located just south of McDowell Road at the intersection of McDowell Road and 10 Street. For some reason I was fixed on the airplane flying over the building located on the southwest corner of 10th St. and McDowell Rd.  As it flew over I noticed the stars around the airplane were stationary.  I then noticed one star just to the 1 to 2 o'clock position of the aircraft when it suddenly shot towards the rear of the aircraft, then circled around behind your craft over to it's 9 o'clock position. It trailed and traveled with the aircraft in a parallel motion tracking and pacing the aircraft for approximately 1 to 2 seconds and then it faded and disappeared.  As I recall, the star or the UFO was constantly illuminated and looked like a star and at no time did it appear.  It looked like it was just sitting there stationary the whole time waiting for the aircraft to fly by. And that was the end of the UFO encounter.

Last year I saw in Canada an account on Unsolved Mysteries which I taped to show my wife and our friend who was visiting us when the TWO INCIDENTS which the three of us saw on MARCH 12 and 13.  I just reviewed your database and see that one entry is for the 12th. OBSERVATION: Usually every night I take a walked around the block, a couple or three laps around the our mobile home south of Florence, Az. Mar. 12:  probably around 8:00 p.m, perhaps 8:30pm (between TV shows) I did my laps and noticed the a band of lights to the west where we can see the glow of Phoenix lights.  Unlike what was seen the next evening, there were gaps in the display.  From our perspective the lights were in one line dipping to the north, higher at the south end.  The lights were white BUT there were gaps between them  as best as I can recall there may have been 5 or 6 displaying a pattern but with gaps in the pattern, such as #1 was on, #2 wasn't, but #'s 3 and 4 were and #5 may have beeen of while #6 was light.  Anyway I called out my wife and our friend to see them, and I speculated that perhaps these were flares from night jumping  (the Coolidge airport where paratroopers have done night jumping is in line with the Phoenix air port, in fact, we are on the flight path for aircraft approaching Sky Harbor from the east or south east. I just can't remember if I took my binoculars out but I believe I did.  What surprised was that there seemed to be not perceptible downward movement yet this the fact that I jumped to the conclusion that the north end was lowest fit in with my idea that the first flare would be lower than the last flare dropped. March 13:  Again I saw the lights about the same time and again no perceptible downward movement BUT as been widely reported, this time there where no gaps in the lights--which to me meant that none of the flares were duds. I am really surprised that perhaps only one observation was make for the evening before since while there were fewer lights each one had the same intensity.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Shortly after they hovered in place, pulsating and began moving at odd trajectories.  They did this for several minutes, blinking in and out.  Moments later, they had vanished from view. Driving Northbound on West I-10, from the Chandler Blvd exit, Miles looked out the car windshield and noticed the objects positioned at one o'clock. As they were falling, I noticed five objects, three with sparks coming off of them.  Then I got Demian's attention and we both witnessed them stop above the horizon of the city lights, hover, and began pulsating.  Two, started moving independantly of the others at various right angles and spiral motions, while the others maintained a steady pattern.By this point we had passed the Elliot Rd. offramp and were proceeding toward the Superstition Freeway.  By the time we had crossed beneath the Guadalupe Rd. overpass, they had vanished from sight.  From our assumption, they appeared to be East of Sky Harbor by a few miles, somewhere over Tempe.There is not a dought in our minds that this unexplained phenominon is indeed explainable.  For the record, this report was typed prior to reviewing the posted repots..;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Airline pilot views Phoenix lights from Interstate 10, while driving to work.;1997-03-13 20:15:00;10 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates in report that date of occurrence was 15MR97.  Based on telephone conversations with the same witness, we suspect that he is referring to the major events reported over Phoenix on Thursday night, March 13, 1997.  If our surmise is incorrect, we will change the date back to 15MR97 at a future date.)) Airline pilot views Phoenix lights from Interstate 10, while driving to work. I have recently discovered your site and have enjoyed perusing it's contents. I read with some interest your report on the Phoenix Lights as I was a witness to their passage on the night in question. I am a pilot with one of the major carriers here in the valley and I live in the South Mountain area. On that night I was on my way to work and traveling north along interstate 10 at approximately 8:15 PM. The lights first appeared to me to be over the airport in a wide formation and traveling in a southerly direction, roughly over the interstate. There is no question that they were anomalous, they got my attention immediately, and I was concerned enough about distractedly weaving into other traffic while observing them, that I pulled off the interstate to watch them go overhead. Where my account seems to differ from the accounts of other witnesses is that I perceived the lights to be individual objects, five in all, traveling in a roughly triangular formation. As they passed overhead, I took note of a particularly bright star and noted that the star was never obscured by any solid object as the lights passed it. When the lights were directly overhead, they appeared to be comprised of two lights per object, the bright light in the direction of motion and a much fainter light immediately behind it. There was no variation in the color of the lights and no blinking or twinkling. It was very difficult to judge the altitude of the objects, as they were never more than pinpoints of light moving very slowly if I had to guess, I would say they were at very high altitude. I know this is at odds with some of the more dramatic reports of a gigantic dark object, but I am certain that I am not mistaken. Being a pilot, I am a trained observer of lighted airborne objects and, while these lights were indeed strange, there is no doubt in my mind that they were individual objects and not the running lights on some single large object.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
The Phoenix Lights, March 13, 1997 . . . I Saw Something Different;1997-03-17 20:15:00;~4 minutes;The Phoenix Lights, March 13, 1997 . . . I Saw Something Different. The Phoenix Sighting March 13th, 1997, I Saw Something Different.  This is my story.  It was March in North Phoenix, Arizona.  The Mulberry tree was bare of its leaves, and the weather was chilly.  My residence at the time was at twenty Fourth Avenue just south of Union Hills Road.  This is near the I-17 freeway, and just east of it. It was a cool, clear and quiet night with no clouds.  It was eight fifteen in the evening mountain standard time.  I decided to go outside in my backyard.  I brought my book and book light.  I was sitting in my folding chair in the middle of the lawn facing southwest.   As I was reading, something caught my attention.  To the north, my right peripheral vision alerted me to huge bright lights approaching low and coming right at me!  It was very low.  Immediately, I thought something was going to crash.  Get down!  I dropped my book and lamp.  The chair fell over.  I found  myself lying on my back, my face up, looking directly up at the sight. My view was unobstructed.  It was not a plane.  It was five very large round soft lights, that did not shine down that glided along silently, in a v formation.  There was absolutely no wings.  There was absolutely no fuselage or body.  I saw clearly the black sky and stars between each large light.  Of this, I am absolutely certain. The five lights were moving together very slow and low.  Each light was distinctly separate and detached from one another.  Silence. The mulberry tree was near the west end of the yard near the wall.  I was in the center of the yard.  The v formation extended directly over top of me and over the neighbors' yard on the other side west of the property wall.  I could see the entire formation. There were no flashing lights.  There were no colored lights.  All five large round lights were white.  The lights were not shining down.  The lights were soft and white.  It was silent. It was amazing to see such a spectacular sight.  I even waved at the lights.  There were no windows or portals, and there was no body or wings.  The five large lights were gliding together in formation but they were separate and independent of one another.  The formation was gliding very slow.  I thought that if it moved any slower that it would come to a stop right there in the air.  The silent formation continued on its way south toward downtown Phoenix.  I stood up and watched it until it was out of view. I went inside and recorded in writing my incredible experience in my journal.  That night I thought I was the only one who saw this amazing sight.  I went to bed.  The next morning it was all over the news. The news said there was a report of the Lights called in by a eighteen wheeler truck driver who was heading south on highway I-17.  This was just before the Lights arrived at my location. The news videos showed what happened when the five large round lights in v-formation arrived over downtown Phoenix.  There they were, stationary in the air, at a complete stop.  They presented themselves this way.  Once they had everyone's attention, suddenly they all blinked out. Then after a few moments they blinked on, one at a time until there were twelve lights.  They were in an arch formation with a single light behind and alone a short distance down from the inside of the arch.  It reminded me of a stingray formation with the single light representing the tail. The Phoenix lights remained like this for quite some time.  Clearly, who ever or whatever they were certainly wanted the people to notice them.  It was visibly observed by hundreds of folks downtown.  The twelve lights remained stationary in mid air for quite some time. When the five lights arrived in the skies over downtown Phoenix, they were much higher and appeared much smaller, like tennis ball size.  There was filmed news coverage and many civilian reports.  Small aircraft were flying under them.  Large jets were landing and taking off at the Phoenix International Airport.  News and police helicopters flew around.  Luke Air force base sent out jets to investigate.  Air Traffic control was inundated with calls.  People were out and about downtown and saw it all.  Calls were flooded in to the police and sheriff’s departments.  Nobody had any answers. The stingray formation remained stationary in place above the Phoenix sky downtown for quite a while.  When they were ready, all the twelve circular lights suddenly blinked out together.  Then they reappeared again as five large circular lights in a chevron formation. This was exactly the way the lights were as I originally witnessed them at very close range. Silently, they moved together in the Chevron formation to the west and flew slowly and silently turning north again near the 101 freeway and continuing north and out of sight. After this, for days and weeks talk and speculations abounded.  There was a town meeting called to discuss what the people saw.  Jim Dilettoso of Village Labs in Tempe, Arizona, digitally examined the video and film data.  It was scientifically determined the lights were not flares.  All lighting was compared with the different types of lighting in Phoenix.There were no matches.  It was determined there were no known lights of this kind, and considered it an unknown. I want to say that what I saw was different and closer than what many others saw. I saw it up close. It was close enough that it was a stone’s throw away. I am a credible witness, educated and I hold a doctorate. I have not heard any witness reports of this sighting as close as I witnessed it. For example, Scottsdale is quite a ways east of Phoenix and the I-17.  There was a woman in north Scottsdale that saw the formation but it was very tiny at that distance that was nearly microscopic.  She took pictures.  All that was in the picture were very tiny dots of light.  This witness and others who were not anywhere close to the sighting claimed there was a fuselage and wings between the lights.  Some said there were windows and beings looking out the windows.  I beg to disagree.  I can assure you this is nonsense. I saw what I saw and I don’t deny it.  This is my story.  This is the absolute truth. Respectfully submitted. PS.  I have remained silent until now because at the time I was in practice and was employed by a corporation.  If I spoke of such things, I would have risked my job.  So I kept silent until now.  Today, I am retired, and I am relieved to at last tell the truth of my Phoenix Lights experience.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

They would cluster, form V shapes, inverted Vs, cluster in a stationary loation. They then travelled west doing the same manuvers a high rate of speed. Clear skies, no moon, temp. approx 85, calm winds. Seen also by someone else located 3 miles west of me. None traditional aircraft could only manuver like these did. At approx. 21:50 on May 9, 1997, I was in my back yard located in south Phoenix. I observed 6-8 white round lights south of my location approx 3 miles at an altitude of approx. 10,000. The objects stayed in one place while they would cluster into such a tight formation that they appeared as one, then manuver into a V shape, inverted V shape, straight line and then back to a cluster. I went into my house and got my wife, 42 years old and two children 20 and 22 years to witness what I saw. We four watched the objects for approximately 2-3 minutes as they travelled west continuing to manuever into the aforementioned shapes until out of sight.I am a retired police officer, 47 years old. I have been trained to observe and report observations. This is the first such sighting myself and family have seen, however, I do believe in UPOs.

I was outside one early a.m. approximately 3:00 A.M., there were no clouds in the sky.  I was loading my car with Work Supplies.  I noticed that long streaks of light (that put me in mind of instant Icicle Like Streaks that were suddenly appearing all over the sky, they filled up the sky and then seem to be forming clouds.  I swear... After only an hour or so watching,the whole sky was full of clouds. From nothing? After finally convincing my husband of the bizzarness of this, he agreed that we should to take a drive out and away from the city lights to obeserve.  So, the following A.M., we saw more of the same thing, HOWEVER... in between these clouds, were hovering white lights (posing as stars) that seemed to be hiding behind these clouds.  They moved back and forth, Up and Down. It seemed like whenever we would point them out to each other or notice them, they would move behind a cloud for cover.  We observed at least, 10-15 At A Time.   Then, out popped a sporadically moving, (STRAIGHT UP, FAR LEFT, DOWN, FAR RIGHT, THEN UP) A Extremely FAST Flashing RED Object, this thing was All over the place. It moved this way until it found a cloud to hide behind.  The reason I say this, is because, when it popped out again, it wasn't moving sporadically.  Until, what seemed, it realized it was revealed, then there it went again, All Over the Place Again, then disappeared behind the clouds.  We were so freaked out, being that we were out in the middle of a secluded area,and then also realizing that these objects were not far away from us at all.  That they could be aware that we were watching.  We Beat It Out Of There... & Quick!!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

As we all know about the Phx. lights I did not see those first hand but this looked alot like the objects I saw on tv. I will contiue to keep my eyes to the sky. Brite yellowish (landing light) look to them but no movement? Clear night Unlimited visibility Not a lot of light polution from surounding street lights. No report on scanner aircraft bands or Alb. center from other  aircraft . I monitor all freq. on a regular basis no reports to local sherrifs office on monitored ferq. Did not call Luke AFB at this time. Very different traffic patern if this was a standard aircraft. My home is 2mi from Luke AFB did not see any strange latenight activity in the area. My brother ((name deleted)) who just started his web page www.((deleted)).com also linked from Artbells site  is a person that I spend a great deal of time with and he helps explain some of the things that can be seen in the night sky I have several  hundred hrs watching the sky with him and this was not a normal light or one that I have ever seen?

Two bright amber lights seen over Phoenix;1999-06-09 20:50:00;1 hour +;Two bright amber lights seen over Phoenix At approximately 8:50 PM, I was looking south-south west from my front yard in North Scottsdale and saw what appeared at first to be distant commercial aircraft landing lights climbing out of Phoenix Sky Harbor. As I continued to watch I noticed that the lights did not move and they also were a distinctly different color than landing lights. I got my binoculars and the lights can only be described as a two separate very bright but deep amber in color with one light slightly lower than the other.  There appeared to be no connecting structure between the lights and no other lights associated with the object(s). I initially estimated the distance at about 10 miles (incorrectly). The sky was clear with many stars visible.  Visibility in the Phoenix area is nearly unlimited and lighted objects could easily be seen at night 100 miles on the low horizon. My wife, and daughter also watched the lights as they remained perfectly motionless. Suddenly, one light dimmed and turned off, then perhaps two seconds later the other turned off. Then a moment later both lights came on again in exactly the same location.  My daughter and I decided to get in the car and investigate at this point. We drove in the direction of the lights all the way into Phoenix, approximately 25 miles south while observing the objects on and off.  The separation between the lights widened as we got closer.  During the drive the lights turned on and off at least two times.  Finally, upon rounding the big bend going southbound at the top of the Squaw Peak highway the lights were clearly visible and obviously much closer. My best estimate of their physical location was approximately 3/4-1 mile west of the South mountain antenna farm, and at an altitude of perhaps 3-4000 feet above ground level. At this point the lights were approximately two and a half fingar widths apart at arms length and still at the same inclination angle but higher above the horizon. They appeared to be literally glued in place...no movement whatsoever. All of this was occuring in Phoenix Sky Harbor's very busy Class B controlled airspace!! Certainly the tower operators could have had a clear view of these objects to the southwest as they were only about 3 miles away.  At this time the objects were at an approximate 35 degree angle above the horizon. I am an aerospace engineer and private pilot. I roughly estimate the distance between the lights to be 500 feet gauging from the rate of change of spacing and elevation above ground over the distance. Upon reaching the turnoff to Sky Harbor airport the lights turned off and did not return. At home the lights were perhaps 5-10 degrees above the horizon. Our home north of Phoenix is actually 1000 feet higher in field elevation than central Phoenix, plus we had a clear an unobstructed view initially. The following morning I listened on the radio for any reports of the objects, but unbelievably there were no reports!  People see so much in the air that even if something is unusual it is simply shrugged off.  I would like to know if anyone else has seen these objects. They were visible for over an hour. I know these were not an aircraft lighting system, and they were too stationary to be an aircraft or airship.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
I saw a light flying across the sky, from west to east, at an extraordinary speed.  It flew in a straight line, slowed a bit then speed;1999-11-09 19:40:00;5 sec;I saw a light flying across the sky, from west to east, at an extraordinary speed.  It flew in a straight line, slowed a bit then speeded up again, it traveled a great distance in seconds,near the horizon it veered right and disappeared out of sight.  I could see many aircraft in the sky, because we were north of Sky Harbor airport. The speed of this light was amazingly fast in comparison to the aircraft in the area.  I've seen hundreds of meteors in my life and am positive it was not a meteor, a plane, a bird, a bat, a reflection, a satelite, or a rocket.  I've never seen anything like this before and am writing this because I have no idea on what other recourse to take. I work an evening shift and at 7:30pm two co-workers and myself went outside because they smoke cigarettes. I don't smoke, but just went with them to talk.  We went up to the top floor of a four story parking lot for employees of the company.  The weather was great, were in Phoenix, there were plenty of stars, were near downtown, so the city lights drown the sky, yet it was easy to see the entire sky from this roof top.  Squaw peak mountain is several miles to the northeast of us and I could see a light mist near the peak.  Off on the east I could see some light clouds on the distant horizon.  Planes could easily be seen circling for a landing or take-off from Sky Harbor airport to the southeast. I saw a huge thick bright meteor to the east headed straight down, very bright with specks of bright green. It burned up and I was impressed with the thickness, brightness, and straight down direction that it had. It seemed very close, but I know these things can actually be very far away. All three of us saw the meteor.  We continued talking and about ten minutes later I commented again on how beautiful the meteor had been and the others were agreeing, just then, my friend said whats that, I turned around and saw the light zooming across the sky.  My first thought was a plane, it looked like it had a dim red speck on it. I've also seen birds fly by a night at close distances that appear to fast high flying vehicles, but I quickly dismissed this being a plane or a bird.  Phoenix is full of helicopters, I see them alot. This was definitely not a helicopter. Way too fast, went very far, fast.  I thought it might be some type of reflection. No clouds, it varied it speed, slightly, then veered right.  It wasn't a reflection.  It happened very quickly and the third person in the group never caught eye of it.  I've seen satelites before and I even saw the shuttle fly by one morning as it was about to land in California. This was faster than that. Did anyone else see anything? Just when you think you seen it all....I! was ama zed!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Airborn object with bright light disappeared.;2000-03-30 18:50:00;3 seconds;Airborn object with bright light disappeared. Driving SE on I-10 south of Phoenix, AZ, at about milepost 184 at 18:50 hours I observed a single, bright light at an apparent elevation of 10 degrees above the horizon. It was located SE of me along and above the freeway. The light was noticeably brighter than the headlamps of oncomming automobiles. The light was not a point source: it had a visible diameter perhaps 1/10 of the diameter of a full moon. I observed this object for about two seconds. It was stationary above the freeway and I at first thought it to be a police helicopter monitoring traffic. There was enough ambient light (this was post sundown but before twilight) to readily see details on cars and scenery miles away. I had the impression that I could almost see some sort of vehicle behind the bright light in the sky. There were neither wings nor identifying aircraft lights visible on the object. I looked down to size up the traffic around me for no longer than one second and then looked back up to try to identify the airborn object. It was gone. I looked all over the southeastern sky and could see no trace of it. Had it been a helicopter or light aircraft which had simply turned off the light I would certainly have been able to see the craft in the ambient light.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Strange lights in Phoenix sky reappear in formation.;2001-02-11 19:00:00;?;Strange lights in Phoenix sky reappear in formation. We were vacationing in Phoenix, Arizona and on Feb. 11, 2001 and saw 5 lights in formation high above the mountains. We were facing north. The lights were stationary for awhile, then one light moved rapidly to the left. Suddenly, there appeared another light with the remaining four. We could not determine what the lights were. At first we thought they were helecopters, but when one would suddenly appear, we knew it must be something else. The couple we were with, who lived in the area, had never seen the lights before, and were as baffeled as we were as to their origin.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Small yellow light following jetliner;2001-03-27 21:30:00;90 seconds;Small yellow light following jetliner My home is in north central Phoenix, along the approach pattern for aircraft landing at the local airport. (sky harbor) I am familiar with most types of aircraft (civilian and military) and can usually identify them quickly, due to their low altitude. (about 5000 feet)  Most of the aircraft are Boeing 737's, moving from due east to due west flying the approach to Sky Harbor, though there are a few Air Bus 300's, Boeing 757's, and MD-80's. On Tuesday evening (3/27/01) at about 9:30 pm I was standing in my backyard. There were a few aircraft in the approach pattern, I would say one every 3 to 5 minutes. As I looked to the south I noticed an aircraft (looked like a Boeing 757) moving from south west, to northeast, passing just east of my position. I then noticed a very small, dim yellow light which seemed to be following the 757 about one and a half plane lengths behind. As the jet got closer (to me) the light began a slow arc to the northwest, executing a turn of roughly 90 degrees. If I had to estimate the size of the light, I would say it was less than 10 feet in diameter, based on its proximity to the aircraft. The strangest thing of all was the way in which the light moved. It was like a fish swimming. It continued on a northwest course and just blinked out after about 10 seconds;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Gold light with halo, with bits falling from it.;2001-08-26 21:28:00;21:29;Gold light with halo, with bits falling from it. It was a bright light.  It had a rich gold color and moved at a constant speed.  It looked as though it had a halo just above the light but at a slanted angle (about 45 degrees), just around the tip of the light, but the halo was very vague and my friend didn't see it too well.  My friend and I noticed when it started getting distant it looked as though it was droping something, like pieces of it were falling off and then fading away (like little gold drops).  We first thought it might be a flare fizzing out, but since I live in an urban area of Phoenix there are very rare instances where military jets fly over dense areas of the city and I don't remember flares being gold color and traveling at that speed.  We thought the light was going to fade out but it didn't, it kept a constant speed (a little faster than an aircraft.)  There were no sudden speed increases or change in course.  My friend suggested it might be a meteor, but from what I know I don't think it was.  It was too slow for a meteor and too fast for an airplane.  I looked for blinking lights but it had none.  There was an instance where we thought it disapeared because the light faded away, but it came back and then it finally left our line of sight.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
7 Unknows Objects - Estrella Mountain's - Phoenix AZ;2002-02-14 21:30:00;5 - 6 minutes;7 Unknows Objects - Estrella Mountain's - Phoenix AZ At approx. 2115 I was driving South down the Loop 101 (Phoenix, AZ) when I notice 4 to 5 objects appear in the area of the Estrella Mountains.  At first nothing was there then one by one each of these 4 or 5 objects appeard.  As I watched them I noticed commercial aircraft passing by however these objects were not in motion.  Each object was blinking two colors, orange and red, and where lit for approx 5 to 6 minutes, then one at a time disappeared.  When I got home I ran to the back yard, with my wife, and the objects were gone.  As I was talking with my wife, I notice 2 more objects off the the west (towards the Buckeye area.)  Both of these objects looked the same as the 4 or 5 I saw on the way home.  My wife witnessed these objects with me as well.  As we were watching the objects to the south came back, in the same area (Estrella Mountains.)  We watched and watched for approx. 5 to 6 more minutes then the objects (all) disappeared one by one.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Lights in the southern Phoenix Area;2002-03-12 20:15:00;1.5hr;Lights in the southern Phoenix Area My wife and I were outside this evening when we notice objects in the sky at about 08:15pm.  We, both my wife and I, have seen these objects before, however this experience was a bit different.  The objects would light up with an orange glow.  I ran inside grabbed my telescope and noticed (through the telescope) that the objects were alternating in color from red, orange, green, then white.  At first I thought I was possibly looking at a streetlight, however, these objects were at a high altitude and I realized that the lights were alternating at a very fast rate.  These objects would appear in the vicinity (looked like) just past the Estrella Mountains and towards the city of Gila Bend.  This area is a Restricted Zone for all aircraft, except to military Restricted Zone's R-2031E & R-2035 approx. 4 1/2 - 5 Nautical Miles at 220 degrees.  Neighbors told me that the light I, and my wife, had witnessed were Flares, however how can a flare sit in one spot for minutes at a time?  I was also told, possibly, these lights were from the military aircraft doing maneuvers with the After-burners on???  The thought had crossed my mind but again, how is it possible to see an after-burner for minutes at a time, not moving???  Another noticeable feature was the objects would light up and disappear in the same spot each and every time.  One object was approx., just past the mountains SW and 2 other object appeared to the west approx. 30 or so miles away.  I ask myself these questions, yet, unable to clarify and answer.  I though I would share this info with you and to see if anyone else have seen these objects. Thank you for your time.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Possible Iridium Flares,…strange;2002-06-01 21:38:00;20 seconds;Possible Iridium Flares,…strange I believe I witnessed 2 Iridium flares. On the evening of 06/01/02 I was sitting in my backyard (ZIP 85014) facing east, at approximately 21:00 Hours. At roughly 21:28 Hours I observed what I believed to be a polar orbiting satellite moving from North to South. I caught it just before it reached its zenith relative to my position. It looked very much like all the other satellites I have seen over the years, a faint but definite, tiny orb of soft white light, with just a hint of orange. Just as this object hit it's zenith, it flared, quite brilliantly, and faded back to what I would describe as Normal for a satellite. The flare lasted approximately 3 seconds. At 21:38 Hours I saw a re-play of the first event. The second events flare seemed quite a bit brighter, and possibly as a consequence, I could not track the second object after the flare. I very firmly believe these objects were Man made, and not some sort of Alien Spacecraft. What troubles me is that they do not seem to conform to Iridium orbits. Am I wrong?

Lights above the Estrella Mountains (Phoenix, AZ);2002-12-25 23:30:00;15mins;Lights above the Estrella Mountains (Phoenix, AZ) At approx. 11:30pm I notice a light, located past and above the Estrella Mountains (Phoenix, AZ).  I had recently seen this object a few nights before, however due to Sky Harbor International Airport and the traffic pattern for the aircraft, I thought it was just another airplane.  This object didn't seem to move when looking at it from the distance where I was, however, when looking at the object through my telescope I noticed that the object would not stay stationary.  The object had Blue (Possibly Green) and Red lights, which you would believe to be the position lights on an airplane.  While watching the object it would move from side to side, normally if an aircraft turns the light on the wingtips would alternate to the other side.  This object did not.  There wasn't (at least from what I could see) any anti-collision or strobe lights on it, just the Blue and Red.  Luke Air Force Base is close to my home and other lights have been seen in the distance, South - Southwest of the airbase.  I have videoed some lights in the AZ sky however I was told that these lights are flares from the Air Force.  As for the lights seen, recently, I have seen it before.  Again, may be just another aircraft in the Phoenix sky.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

The sighting was from this location, but not at this location. While working, my partner and I heard the engine of a (large)plane decrease rapidly. My partner, (who is located in another area of the site that we both work at), radioed to me regarding the sound of the engine decrease. I responded to him that I did hear the engine decrease and looked up to see the plane. It did not appear to be in any trouble and continued on it's way south towards the Phoenix metro area. As I turned my sight away from the plane, I noticed a light in the sky south/south west of our location. I watched it for a couple of seconds and my partner radioed to me again regarding the light. I informed him that I was watching the light and that it did not appear to be moving in any direction. We both watched the light and as we did, we noticed the light was changing color from an orange to a red and back and forth. It was at this point that my partner radioed to me that he was going to join me at my location. Upon arrival, we both stood there getting a bearing on it to see if it had moved. It didn't. We tried to come up with explanations for what we were witnessing and after about 15 minutes of not coming up with anything substatial, another light appeared just to the east and a little higher. Since the lights were miles away, there was no way for us to tell exactly what it was that we were viewing. Two minutes into the sighting of both lights, the first just went out. Some surprise for both of us, to say the least. About a minute later, a third light appeared slightly higher and to the west of the one we were now viewing. Then the second one went out. As we were watching this incredible light show, I asked for my partner's cell phone to call my wife so that she could maybe see it. I really didn't think she had a chance considering we live in the heart of Phoenix. She never got to a clear spot in time. The third and final light went out! After a few minutes, my partner turned to me and said Where are all the planes that were flying around here? True. Not a plane in the sky. As if they were told to vacate the area. Only a half hour before, we had counted at least 15 aircraft in the vicinity. We watched the skies for an hour after that and never saw another light. The entire incident lasted for 30 minutes.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

One appeared to have a blue/green light on the bottom and the other a red indicator while the third remained bright, then they resumed the original color and patterns. They displayed some maneuvers hovering atop one another just being stationary and then zooming past once again, at first we thought it was a helicopter than they split up.  We smelled a funny odor when they passed the second time like fuel but an odd more pungent smell.  We were driving in the oposite direction and several other cars were on the freeway with us, they too slowed down but, kept moving not knowing what we were experiencing, in the rear view mirror it seemed to continue for as long as we could see them.

Well, I saw the peculiar amber orbs of light again tonight. This is probably the fifth time in about three years. It is the same every time. Amber lights in the southwest sky, past the Sierra Estrella Mountains, and in the direction of the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range. But I am guessing the lights are closer to the Phoenix area.It always occurs in the period between 9:00 to 10:30pm.Two or three stationary yellowish-orange lights appear-fade out-then reappear five minutes later in the same spot. In a previous sighting the lights appeared to blend or change colors also. If they are illumination flares, wouldn't they descend earthward? . Another report once estimated the location of the lights in the vicinity of Rainbow Valley. This would seem to be pretty much on target-but hard to say for sure.  I once saw one of these lights at a much closer distance while piloting a single-engine light aircraft between Gila Bend and Yuma. I estimated the distance at 10 miles. This time it was more like an intensely bright fireball that faded and reappeared. I suppose it could be some type of experimental flare.Thanks;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Large bright white light over downtown Phoenix;2004-01-06 18:40:00;15 min.;Large bright white light over downtown Phoenix My fiancee and I first noticed the very bright large white light in the night sky upon walking out to get in our car to go to the store. It was South-west in the sky and about half again as high above the downtown buildings as the planes after they level off from Sky Harbor. In fact we watched several commercial liners and a helicopter fly in the approximate area of the sky only lower during this sighting. Basically it was caught our eye because it was so big and so bright-it grew dimmer very gradually till it just faded out from view about 10 minutes after I left the car to go into the store-on my way in-I showed a clerk to look up at it-and she tried to figure out what she was seeing as well.  There were no blinking lights, just one bright white light about 10 times brighter and larger than any typical star in the sjy-but there were no other stars in the sky at the this time. The light never appeared to move-just faded out. It seemed to just hang there. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness intended a date in 2004, not 2003.  We have amended the date above.

It was 8:50 01/26/04. I saw a slowly pulsating (and very odd) vivid red light. My first impression was that I was seeing a conventional aircraft in a very tight turn or maneuver. Quite soon it became apparent that the light was actually standing still. At this point I alerted my friend, and we exited the vehicle for a better look. The light continued to pulsate very slowly, completely disappearing, and then turning back on. We stood there watching this extremely odd stationary object, when my friend suggested I fetch my binoculars. Did so, but it was all over by the time I returned. This was a very unusual event.

The light appeared the same as the first and duplicated the same flight pattern, then faded out. This all happened in about 15-20 seconds. I was very interested by this point so I continued to watch this part of the sky. About 1 minute later I spotted two lights traveling side-by-side heading south. The lights were traveling at a very high speed. Faster than any aircraft I've ever seen, and faster than satallites I've seen in the sky. The light on the right veered off from the left one at a higher rate of travel in a looping turn and disappeared. I've always been a critic of people that claim to see this type of stuff.

Our home is approximately 20 miles north of downtown Phoenix, in the planned community of Anthem, right off Highway 17 on the way to Fl;2004-06-14 21:00:00;5 minutes;Our home is approximately 20 miles north of downtown Phoenix, in the planned community of Anthem, right off Highway 17 on the way to Flagstaff. We were in our backyard at approximately 9 p.m. last night looking due south. We were startled to see 2 strings of golden colored lights, each string containing 8 lights. These lights were brighter than conventional aircraft lights but were in perfect alignment with each other, floating in the air without any observed movement.  Within 5 minutes, the lights in the string to the right began to go out, as if a dimmer switch was being used to slowly decrease the light until only darkness remained. There was no obvious logic to the sequence. A couple lights would diminish together and vanish, then a third, etc.  Finally, the string of lights on the left began the same sequence.  We rushed to get binaculars but saw no craft behind the lights. However, once all the lights were gone, we saw 2 helicopters fly into that zone and circle, as if searching for them.  I realized that just lights may not be sexy in terms of a ufo sighting, but it was one of the most startling events of my life, since this is the city known back in 97 for hosting a similar event. I cannot imagine that the military is still playing with flares over a metropolitan area of millions, although that is the obvious conventional explanation that was also offered in 97. I contacted the author of THE PHOENIX LIGHTS (Dr. Lynne) and she also was quite emphatic that the so-called Phoenix Lights phenomena continues routinely, even though the so-called paranormal media has moved on.

Low, bright orange lights appear and multiply suddenly, then disapper as abruptly;2004-06-15 21:30:00;45 Seconds;Low, bright orange lights appear and multiply suddenly, then disapper as abruptly I know this is not the most thrilling sighting, but it's enough for me to take the time to report it. I wonder if anyone else has seen a similar thing.  We live in a house at 1,400 ft elevation that sees clear across the Valley, and often watch the city lights and night sky. As usual, before going to bed, I took one last glance out the window southwest toward Phoenix. There I noticed two bright, orange-hued lights that appeared to be above or past (to the south) South Mountain. I assumed they were on a landing pattern (one behind the other) to Sky Harbor Airport and the orange tinge was due to haze in the air and the angle I was seeing them from. There is always alot of air traffic and though this approach was unusual (for me) to see, an approaching aircraft made sense. They were very bright, though. Then all of a sudden there appeared four, then six. All bunched together (extending my arm they covered the width of about one, maybe two fingers) but not in any perfect geometric formation (at least from my angle.) I thought this had to because the glass in the window was making them appear double or triple. I got my wife on her feet and out we went to see them outisde. There they were, at least six of them (maybe 7 or 8). Very bright, quite orange. They almost seemed to be dancing (this could have been because of refraction due to the heat). Their height was about the same as the radio towers on South Mountain but they were more to the east of them. I got the sense they were over the valley to the south. Then, just as suddenly as they appeared, they one by one disappeared, all in about 10 seconds. It was as if they went below or past the horizon of the mountain, but it's odd to have so crisp a departure from such a distance (South mountain is about 20 miles away.) Maybe this was due to their brightness. I have seen other objects and lights I've wondered about from time to time over/beyond South Mountain but this multiplication, and abrupt departure was unlike anything. Maybe military formation? If they were commercial aircraft why did they appear so suddenly as a group and leave as quickly? Also, usually when I see commercial aircraft that appear orange it! is only from a great distance (or dust storm, smoke from fires, etc.) and they are dull and not nearly so bright. The visbility (from haze, we don't see clouds in June:) was about average or better last night.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Free moving single light floating above Phoenix in the middle of a lightning storm;2004-07-13 23:00:00;2 minutes;Free moving single light floating above Phoenix in the middle of a lightning storm From the northern suburbs of Phoenix looking south towards the downtown area I clearly saw a single red light zig zagging through the sky during the middle of one of the most intense lightning storms Ive ever witnessed.  At first glance I thought it was a firefly caught in the illumination of a distant street light, but then I realized that there was no light in the direction I was looking.  What convinced me that it was a craft of some sort in particular was seeing the other 2 lights that were clearly planes of some sort with the red and blue wing lights flashing that were flying around the edge of the storm.  In comparison to those this light was just a single solid orb that seemed further into the heart of the storm.  It moved around for about a minute and then dipped towards the ground where my view was obscured by a neighbors house.  I watched for about an hour more and saw nothing similar, even after going outside for a clear view of the entire storm.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Bright Red Light;2004-10-15 23:30:00;4 minutes;Around 11:30 I was outside in my backyard when I noticed a very bright red light in the sky west of my location in North Phoenix at a medium to high altitude.  At first I thought it was a commercial jet, but it was not moving, just hanging in the sky-absolutely still and much to high and to bright to be a helicopter.  I awoke my girlfriend who came out to see it, she could not make any sense of it.  After a minute or so it began to pulse going from bright red to a faint transparent red, then back to bright red.  The glow was crisp and had a pureness to it there was no haze or distortion at all.  I went to get the phone to call a friend to take a look at it from his location when my girlfriend called me back, the light was gone, she said that it began to flicker rapidly and that it just disappeared with no trace of movement.  This is the second but different U.F.O. I have seen in the last two months from my location. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) RE: Red Light Over Phoenix This is a follow-up from my report of last night.  This morning at about 9:00 I went outside to look for the ‘red glowing object’ again.  In the exact same spot as the night before there was a metallic silver object motionless in mid air at the exact same altitude as the object I saw the night before.  It was not moving, it was perfectly still.  I went inside to make a call to NUFORC and the object was gone when I came back.  I would estimate the location of the object to be over Cave Creek Rd and the 101 Freeway at an altitude of a thousand to two thousand feet AGL.  I took a photo but my lense was not strong enough to capture anything of clear value. ((END));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Amber lights over Northwest Phoenix;2004-10-20 21:50:00;1 hr 15 min.;Amber lights over Northwest Phoenix From the vantage point of 7th Street and Deervalley in North Phoenix I witnessed amber and red colored lights in a Southwest and West by Southwest direction in varying amounts while on duty as a night security guard. These lights lit up five different times over the course of an hour and fifteen minutes. The first time there were what appeared to be two or three amber lights lined up with one red light and then one amber light separate from the line formation. The second time and third time there was only one amber light which pulsated for about two minutes each time while remaining in exactly the same spot on the horizon. The fourth time there were several amber lights clustered with one red. The red light moved horizontally towards the south slightly after all the amber ones faded out. The fifth time they were clustered again the same way without motion, but much further away (possibly over Sun City or the Peoria Sports Center. I approximate that the first three were probably over Glendale or even close to Arizona State University West Campus. Each time they were lit up for quite and extended period of time and very low in the air over the horizon. I have witnessed these lights on three separate occasions over the last two months. The first two times were over the West end of South Mountain. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports of similar phenomenon, submitted by the same witness, for Septebmer 13 and 22, 2004.

Light above South Mountain, Phoenix;2004-12-14 06:30:00;5 Minutes;Light above South Mountain, Phoenix On my way to work this morning there was a large gold/amber light hovering about 500 above South Mountain in Phoenix Arizona. It hovered in one plave and bobbed slightly up and down and side to side as if it was in water. The light was extremely bright. After a few minutes if began to move south away from the mountain and then it increased to a high rate of speed, in an instant it was just a pinpoint of light and disappeared.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Leaving my girlfriend's grandparents house, noticed a blinking whitish light moving to the northwest. Thought that it was a plane, but;2005-01-27 19:15:00;15 minutes;Leaving my girlfriend's grandparents house, noticed a blinking whitish light moving to the northwest. Thought that it was a plane, but didn't see the typical navigation lights or hear the engine(s). I got into the car and drove. I was on 44th Street and as I approached Indian School, I saw it again, moving in the same direction, very slowly. Must be a plane, I thought to myself. Trying to navigate, but periodically looking towards the sky, I could still see it as I approached Camelback Road. I watched it as it passed near a plane with the standard navigation and strobe lights. It continued the same heading as we approached the area where 44th Street curves to the east and changes into McDonald. Turned left on Tatum and I couldn't see it anymore. As I drove deeper into Paradise Valley, passed Lincoln, I saw it again, same or similar light, blinking and moving slowly. I saw this thing in the sky until I reached my home on the otherside of the Paradise Valley Mall. After I parked my car, I couldn't see it anymore.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Weird star-like object with something dropping off of it.;2005-03-03 20:30:00;1 minute;Weird star-like object with something dropping off of it. We were on an evening walk tonight when my wife spotted a light in the sky that looked like a really bright star which started to turn red.  She pointed it out to me and we watched it together. Again, it looked like a bright red star that was stationary in the sky. Then something fell from it and slowly disintegrated. Whatever was falling was illuminated and looked like it was on fire. We could see the trail of the falling objects.  To me it looked like what you see when a meteor enters our atmosphere and is burning up with pieeces breaking off of it. The main differnce was the primary object remained stationanry in the sky while pieces dropped straight down from it.  Within a minute or two the last peice dropped off and burnt up and the main obect just dissapeared.  Weird. I have no logical explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Orange Star that dropped brilliant white lights.;2005-03-03 22:10:00;20 minutes;Orange Star that dropped brilliant white lights. Spotted an orange object at extremely high altitude, which I first assumed to be a star, moving very slowly from Canus Major in the general direction of Polaris. I called for my daughter to come and watch it since her eyesight is better than mine. For several minutes the object moved very slowly and then became stationary for approximately 5 minutes. While we were lamenting the fact that we didn't have a telescope the object began moving again in the same direction. My daughter observed that the object appeared to be made of two separate objects.  I went into the garage and retrieved my binoculars and we went into the back yard. Upon viewing the object through the binoculars it appeared to made of 3 smaller objects. As we traded the binoculars back and forth the object seemed to be changing in its light intensity. There were several instances where is appeared to disappear completely from view. While I had the binoculars the object began dropping shafts of very brilliant white light (10-12 of them) that seemed to last only a second or two. This lasted for less that 15 seconds. My daughter was seeing the same brilliant lights with the naked eye. After the last white shaft of light appeared the object faded from view a few seconds later and was never seen again.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Triangle, lights,  N. Phoenix, AZ, spring 05.;2005-03-20 03:30:00;1 min. (approx.);Triangle, lights, north Phoenix, AZ, spring 05 Ill state this to the best of my memory.  I was 20 working a pt night shift while in school in north phoenix. Nights are very nice there so i would sit out side for an hour after work. I had been sitting out side staring at the stars maybe seeing a shooting star once in a while. I was doing this for maybe 3 nights prior to seeing this, and was actually thinking how id like to see a ufo, and so i sat peacefully staring and pondering about et and life.  This is when it almost scared me because three stars(lights just dimmer than stars) started to move in unison, in a triangular shape(a triangle that was flat with the earth that distorted with distance) it was heading nw slowly. i tried not to blink because the glair from city lights there made it harder to see the farther it moved.  I was hoping to see it pass a star through the center of the object to determine if it was solid of not but never noticed it happen, just floated silently to disappear in the orange glow of the horizon.  I think i held my breath the entire time so event was very short  Also seen same lights in Colorado, so see my other report Ill file shortly. Ill call it Triangle, lights, front range ,CO, summer 05 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
fast flying light/ball flying over tempe and phoenix arizona.;2005-04-14 23:49:00;7 or 8 seconds;fast flying light/ball flying over tempe and phoenix arizona. about 21:00 on 4/14/2005 i witnessed a shooting star that lasted about 4 seconds or more then moved out of my line of sight.  i've seen meteor showers and have seen many shooting stars in my 29 yrs.  accepted it as a strange shooting star phenomena.   then at 23:49 on same night, a fast flying dimly lit light, faster than all the planes i see constantly, moved for about 7+ seconds from a north to south east position then disappeared, it didn't burn out or anything like that, it just was gone.  noticed same sort of light/ball a few days prior while outside at an eatery patio.  was moving the opposite way.  was seen by few people but girlfriend claimed it was a balloon.  balloons do not move that fast at that altitude and fly an arc-like formation as it was.   i've seen same sort of light flying into columbia river in george, washington a few years prior.  it had no impact or slash.  witness by few friends.  i understand that private jets can fly fast but i've seen too many airplanes to think that it was one.  the reason i believe that it was a ufo is because of the coincidences with the shooting star that lasted longer than i've ever seen and then opposite way later, strange light moving as fast as it was.   i then contacted a tv news station and left messages to maybe have a poll for today (4/15/05)to see how many people saw the shooting star and then the light/ball.  they didn't.  i thought maybe they could call sky harbor international airport and if there had been a fast moving object travelling at 23:49 or so and give me my piece of mind.  i'm believing that i'm passed off as a quack, oh well.  i saw what i've seen.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Phoenix Lights again over North Phoenix both yellowish orange and red near Deer Valley Airport.;2005-05-18 22:00:00;30 min.;Phoenix Lights again over North Phoenix both yellowish orange and red near Deer Valley Airport. I work as a night security guard just north of Deer Valley Airport in North Phoenix. I have seen the Phoenix Lights many times from this location and a few others, perhaps altogether 12 times total.  I saw them again last night (5-18-05) around 10:00pm just southwest of Deer Valley Airport over the city. It was hard to get an exact count of the number of lights involved, but I counted at least 5 which hovered stationary for about 10-15 minutes in exactly the same spot.  Eventually, a small plane which had come in for a landing at the airport swooped back up and headed in the direction of the lights the lights faded out one by one as the small plane approached them. One of the lights seemed to pulsate red in light color while the others were yellowish orange.  In past sightings I had seen these lights in more of an amber color. Based on the color of the amber street lights both near and far (because there is a light refraction effect due to the atmosphere causing slight change in color over distance) and the observable size comparison between the Phoenix Lights and the street lights, I estimate that the Phoenix Lights would have to have been at least three feet in diameter and at least three miles from my location.  As student with a physics major at ASU, after my last sighting I had devised this basic concept in order to guage the size of what I was seeing. I know that this is not a concrete method and is only a somewhat successful estimate. I will be conducting some experiments along this line which may give me a more solid premise. The real key here is exactly what color light was actually being emitted and consequently refracted, so I have used past experiences as a model for the test method.  Over a year ago I had witnessed the lights in front of South Mountain which I later measured with my tripometer in my car to have been no more than ten miles away. Based on my recollection of the color and size from that experience and this new experience, I have come to the conclusion that the light source must be somewhere between 5 to 15 feet in diameter most likely. Hopefully, I will have devised a more precise guaging method by the next time I see them.  During this siting the lights did appear once more about 15 minutes later much farther away and appearing more orange in color the duration of this second instance was approximately two minutes. If my estimates are correct, these are not common flares as so many debunkers (I believe someone from NUFORC even attested to these lights having been flares on Coast to Coast AM if I am not mistaken because of a statement from what was referred to as a credible source's observation) have testified in the past.  I have seen these lights do some amazing things in the past with formations and maneuvers. According to my estimates of size, these light sources would have to be remotely flown or possibly manned flights. My curiosity is piqued.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

More Phoenix Lights over North Phoenix at approximately I-17 Freeway and Carefree Highway;2005-06-08 21:20:00;5 min.;More Phoenix Lights over North Phoenix at approximately I-17 Freeway and Carefree Highway As I arrived to work as a security guard at a trucking company in North Phoenix at 9:20 pm, I saw out the side window of my car 3 lights in a triangular formation fade out one by one over about two seconds they were amber or yellowish orange in color. I saw them only at a glimpse as they started fading out. I do not know how long they had been there. They were to the North and slightly West of my location. This would mean the lights were roughly over I-17 freeway and perhaps Carefree Highway. I have seen these Phoenix Lights many times over the last couple of lights, so I continued to observe that portion of sky in case they would appear again. They did appear lower on the horizon this time there was somewhere between 6 and 10 of them that appeared in a streak or straight line almost as if it were one that was in motion but only appeared in a series of dots of light. This second set of lights appeared about 5 minutes after the first set. The duration of this second set in a line formation was maybe 1 to 2 seconds. All of the lights in the second sighting were amber except for the last one which was red. They appeared from right to left at a slight angle from higher to lower (maybe 2 or 3 degrees off parallel with the ground). The lights were so low to the ground the second time that I could barely see them over the building to the North of this trucking yard. The first set of lights was much higher up in the sky.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Bright Lights seen West side of Phoenix.;2005-06-08 22:00:00;1/2 hr.;Bright Lights seen West side of Phoenix. My husband and I were traveling back from LA to Phoenix where we resided. I-10  I believe.  We saw in front of us, what seemed to be a glow on the ground, at 2 o'clock from where we were positioned, and saw lights in the air, like balls of light, I'm not sure, but maybe 100 ft up in the air.  There were around six of them, perfectly aligned with the road.  I was pretty freaked out, and so was my husband.  I pulled into the last rest area before you hit Phoenix, and you could still see the lights. The lights looked as if they were stretched out for a couple miles or something. at the rest area, there were two we could distinctly see, I had my camera phone on me, and attempted to take pictures.  One, I believe came out, but the other did not. it just looked like a ball of light, nothing flashy.  After seeing photos of the Phoenix lights, I was amazed at how similar it was, but what I saw was slightly different.  6 lights in the air, one on the ground, (which was the first one we saw) and, these lights did not move, at all.  They stayed stationary, and then faded out.  I stayed at the rest area as long as I could, because I wanted to know if these light thingys moved.  I will be honest, I didn't see any movement.  I tried to look for some sort of form, and I did not see any.  I was looking for any clues besides it was a bright white light, so that I would have some definition to what I said once I confessed my report.  I am sorry for not coming forward sooner.

As a security guard for a trucking company I saw at 10:45pm two amber lights appear one at a time Southwest of Deer Valley Airport just above the city of Phoenix. The lights appeared to have some red light to them as well although they remained amber or yellowish orange. The two lights pulsated back and forth between each other while one would dip down slightly as the other rose and then the other would dip down and the other would rise. The lights were present in the same location for about 5 minutes then one at a time they faded out. At 10:54pm the lights appeared again this time there was three of them. They pulsated from left to right in a row parallel with the ground. I watched them again for about 5 minutes as they moved from North Phoenix over to approximately Peoria and then on to Sun City or Surprise so close to the ground that they were barely above the street lights.

The first time they appeared there was approximately eight or ten of them clustered together. They were all amber in color with the exception of one red one.

They lasted again for about two minutes and faded one after the other. About two minutes later they appeared in the same location in the sky, but there were three of them which also disappeared after about two minutes one by one.

Several beams of light vanished and leave only clouds of smoke.;2005-07-14 22:20:00;3-4 Minutes;Several beams of light vanished and leave only clouds of smoke. What I observed was not an object rather 5-7 beams of light shining down to earth as if probing for a target.  The beams were moving in all directions scanning the earth. What made me rule out that they were not helicoptors was that they were extremely high yet I was amazed at the powerful beam of the light to shine dowm from that far of a distance.  I remember it freightened me so I moved behind a shed thinking I was out of the vision of the beams if it made it to my direction.  After viewing the beams for a few minutes a small airplane flew over to the direction of the lights and when it lined up between me and the lights the lights seemed to just go puff and vanished away leaving only clouds of smoke where each beam of light had previously been. I stood in awe and a bit dumb struck at the same time trying to figure out how to evaluate what I'd just seen.

Bright white light - brighter than North Star, no visible blinks or flicker - moved directly UP/out of the atmosphere, and fast.;2005-09-19 19:30:00;30 Seconds;Bright white light - brighter than North Star, no visible blinks or flicker - moved directly UP/out of the atmosphere, and fast. I was outside on our apartment patio smoking a cigarette like I usually do, looking at the sky.  There is slight cloud cover tonight but a breaking over our apartment, stars still slightly visible through the cover.  I was sitting in my patio chair - noticed a bright white light, not flickering, slightly brighter than the north star.  Got up out of my chair to take a look at it, did a TRIPLE take as I thought it was slightly moving - used a much dimmer star next to it as a point of reference. It was definitely moving UP, as in, out of the atmosphere, because I was almost looking straight up at this point.  I kept looking at is as it got dimmer and dimmer and smaller until it had finally faded out into darkness.  It was almost as if it was a shooting star (not quite as bright but close) but going UP instead of down to earth..never seen anything like this before.  There were no visible blinking lights, it was definitely large because a few minutes after it had passed there were other airplanes and such, and even with MORE cloud cover and they had been farther away, the blinking lights were quite visible.  This all took place within about 30 seconds, it had to have been moving very fast to shrink/darken that quickly while moving up..I am kicking myself that I did not come out to have a smoke a minute sooner, I may have caught more.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Yellow Lights seen over South Mountain;2005-10-12 20:02:00;5 minutes;Yellow Lights seen over South Mountain A man and his son next to us after the football game (at Arcadia High School located at 47th Street and south of Indian School Road) in the stands noticed seven lights hanging over the western part of South Mountain.   The son had said that he first only saw six and the seventh quickly thereafter zipped over into place with the others.   We all began to climb to the higher seats in the stands and watch the lights with our binoculars which we had for the football game.  The lights were a yellow color when focusing the binoculars and seemed all to be about the same brightness at first.   After a minute or so the most eastern of these lights quickly disappeared then after another couple minutes another disappeared leaving only four left still shining, then a minute or so later there were only 2 lights remaining.  These seemed to slightly brighter and then seemed to be slightly dimmer, then quicly faded away.   None of the seven lights that I saw ever seemed to move.  We could see the radio/TV towers east of these lights that are on top of South Mountain and it appeared from the angle where these lights are and where we were located that these seven lights were to the western end of South Mountain, certainly west of Central Avenue.   From seeing them in the binoculars it was easy to see that compared to the radio/ TV towers on the South Mountain that these seven lights were not connected to the ground by towers or rope or strings that could be seen.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Pulsing object in Phoenix;2005-10-22 17:30:00;5 minutes;Pulsing object in Phoenix Extremely bright, stationary light in the western sky.   Sun had just dipped beyond the horizon.  Slowly pulsed to maximal intensity to barely visible appx. every 30 seconds.  Pointed it out to a neighbor and she saw it too.   It was in the same spot in the sky for appx 5 min. then it moved to the right (north) and the pulsing light, while moving appx 10cm of the sky dimmed to non-existence.   There was no contrail, no exhaust smoke, no shading of an object.  The light did not sparkle or twinkle, it was just circular, and there was no stars in the sky.  It was extremely bright, considering that it was still quite light outside. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides e-address only.

Lighted cone shaped object floating silently overhead;2005-11-05 00:40:00;6-7 minutes;Lighted cone shaped object floating silently overhead I am not the witness.  Was just told about this from a friend who witnessed an object as he was returning home from a late shift at a restaurant. He was hesitant to share this story with anyone.  Lighted object.  Best described as ice cream cone shaped with two additional triangular protrusions at the base of the cone.  No sharp edges to this lighted object, more of a hazy perimeter.  Object moved east to west basically following the path of a major road.  Low altitude, maybe 150 feet.   Witness was driving toward object, pulled into middle turn lane and watched as it went directly overhead.  Witness pulled off road, got out of car to continue watching.   Object made no sound whatsoever.  As object floated by, all that could be seen from the backside of the object was the uppermost outline of the cone and a slight glow of light into the night sky.  The bottom portion seemed to have just disappeared.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
A bright light, greater than any I have seen on the landing gear of a 747. I am in a place where I see pleanty of 747's.  ((Venus??));2005-11-14 19:30:00;on-going;A bright light, greater than any I have seen on the landing gear of a 747.  I am in a place where I see plenty of 747's. My friend called me, said to look out my window, that there was a very bright light in the southwestern sky.  It is by far the brightest thing I have seen in the sky, quite an intense light, unlike that of what was seen during the Mars' alignment earlier the past couple of Months, this is as bright as landing gear on a 747. I just checked a moment ago, and it is still quite high in the sky.  I do not rule out the fact that it could be a planet.   But, in light of the 'lights over phoenix' a few years back, I thought a report might be warrented, in case there are any other sky watchers out there in the Valley of the Sun, who are as interested in knowing who or what has been, and still are, looking down on us. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness means an evening sighting.  If so, the light she was looking at was Venus, we suspect.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Three Lights reappearing over the NW valley...again!;2006-01-30 20:45:00;5 minutes;Three Lights reappearing over the NW valley...again! Three lights that would alternate between red and yellow. Seemed to hang over the NW valley. These lights were lined up horizontally and moved together in a WSW direction. I and my neighbors observed these lights for seeral minutes then then just disappeared. The lights then reappeared 30 seconds later much farther away. At this time two of the lights were together some distance West of where they were. The third light reappeared at the same time to the North of its original sighting. These lights all appeared and dissapeared in synchronicity. This time we noticed the lights for @ 2 minutes, then they all moved to the SW for about 10 seconds and then Poof! they all disappeared again. I have really bad video footage that shows a minute or so of activity. These lights are very similar to lights I have recorded several months ago.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

It was moving much faster than a jet.   From the time it was first seen in, the Southern sky till it dissappeared into the Eastern horizon, was less than three minutes.  When it was first seen it was coming from the S.S.E..   It passed at about forty-five degrees upward in the East.  About twenty degrees N. from vertical, it abruptly changed course to the N.W., and came to a complete stop.  It then sped off to the S.E. for a second or two and abruptly changed course toward the East and rapidly sped toward  the horizon and out of sight. It maintained the same glow for the entire time it was in sight.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

All  four witnesses saw two round orange lights that would occasionally flicker red/ yellow flying in a horizontal linear formation. These lights flew in formation for about five minutes then the eastern most light(the one on the left) disappeared, followed shortly(perhaps 30 seconds) by the western light(Right side of formation). It is relatively clear out tonight, by that I mean you can see the outline of the surrounding mountain ranges. These lights were well above the summit of the southwestern ranges. We dont believe they disappeared behind them, they just left. Two witnesses saw a third light to the far north west that matched the description of the other two lights. This third light disappeared shortly before the other two. As far as background of the observers: one high school principle, a loan officer, a real estate agent and a local business owner.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Red light over Phoenix area.  Blinking, solid, and then strobing.;2007-03-16 22:30:00;3 minutes;Red light over Phoenix area.  Blinking, solid, and then strobing. We were walking around at a resort in the Phoenix area.  It was night time.  I was looking up in the sky as I was walking, and noticed a red light blinking in the same fashion as an airplane.  A minute or so later, I realized that it wasn't really moving, so I stopped walking to see if maybe it was an illusion because I was walking or if was truly not moving.  When I stopped, I noticed that it was moving at a very slow rate of speed, much too slow to be an airplane.  I then thought that it was perhaps a blimp.  It  started moving in an a zig-zag fashion at that same slow rate of speed.  I told my wife that that is rather odd... we kept watching it for a minute or so and the light then came on solid, and started to pick up speed in a straight line fashion.  It hit what appeared to be airplane speed in a straight direction.  Then, it proceeded to start blinking in a strobe fashion and appeared to plummet towards the Earth.  We watched as it streaked down towards the horizon at a shooting star type of speed, all the while it was strobing in a very rapid fashion.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Two lights traveling at irrational speeds, sometimes seeming to not move at all.;2008-02-13 18:01:00;13 Minutes;Two lights traveling at irrational speeds, sometimes seeming to not move at all. Looking Northeast from Central Phoenix, I saw two lights traveling Northwest.  One light seemed to travel ahead of the other light, then all of the sudden they seemed to be traveling together, then one light would lag behind and the other would travel up and then down quickly.  I can see the planes turning near the mountain preserves on approach to Sky Harbor, and I judged that the lights were approximately at an altitude of 8000 feet and about 20 miles from where I live.  The strange thing about the sighting was the irrational travel of the lights, and the speed at which they were traveling.  At times, it was as if they were not moving at all.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Green light in night sky moving incredibly fast over Phoenix Arizona 031508 22:40 hrs.;2008-03-15 22:40:00;Less than 2 sec;Green light in night sky moving incredibly fast over Phoenix Arizona 031508 22:40 hrs. At approximately 22:40 hours, I was southbound on 51st Avenue in Phoenix, Az.  I had just turned onto 51st Ave from Indian School Road and had travel about 200 feet.  I had my radio on, and it was playing rather loudly.  Over the sound of the music, I thought I heard a ‘pop’ or a ‘rumble’, and looked up into the night sky.  It was dark and cloudy.  From behind me, up in the sky, a very bright green light shot through the sky, also going southbound, and traveled very far and very fast.  I have never seen anything move that fast.  This entire incident lasted less than two seconds.  I would estimate that it went as far as South Mountain before disappearing in the sky.  The green light was about the size of a dime coin if I was to hold it above me against the windshield, and did not get much smaller than that in overall size as it moved away from me.  There was no tail, no trailing smoke or anything one might associate with a meteorite.  It was not a solid ball of light it had points of light, like a star in the sky.  It moved incredibly fast, in a straight line, it did not arc towards the earth it remained elevated in the sky, and disappeared in the distance like a light going out. This was fascinating and beautiful to see.  It was incredibly fast, and from the distance that I estimate it traveled, I don’t think we have anything publicly known that can travel that fast.  I believe other people in cars behind me saw this as well.  I suspect it was a meteorite, but it was just an awesome sight, and cannot explain the lack of an arc or a tail if it was.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Three lights in a triangluar shaped formation floating over horizon for a good two hours.;2008-07-14 12:00:00;100-120 minutes;Me and my wife witness. Three lights in a triangluar shaped formation floating over horizon for a good two hours. I was driving to Prescot from Green Valley, on high way 8 with my family for familly dinner, when suddenly my 8 year old son said Daddy!, theres' a ship in the sky!  Me and my wife then looked up to see three green lights in a HUGE triangle, or V formation.  The object moved about every 5 minutes, from side to side, or up and down. My wife, who was frightened said Call the police! Call the Police!.  Sadly, we had left our cellphones in the baby bag at home.  So i stopped the car to look up at the strange object.  The lights were flashing green and they didn't seem to be connected to each other.  But they stayed in a straight line and continued to hover.   About 20 minutes into watching it it climbed a few 100 feet into the air and continued to hover.  It moved vigorously up and down from side to side.  As it climbed, thats lights became whiter and whiter, and soon became pure white.  For a moment, we couldn't see it because of the tree's.  But soon enough it hovered over our car.  It was at a high altitude, so i could not say if it was directly above or not.   But then it started slowly moving west, turning counter clock wise [ which was odd, because it was a triange shaped air craft ].  It then sped off at almost the speed of light maybe 50-60 miles west.  It was just above the horizon when it stopped.   Then another 5 or ten minutes later, it sped off into the horizon disappearing completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I had seen them before I went into the store, but didn't pay that much attention, thinking they were two planes together, because it was at a distance to where I was I only glanced that way and noticed it but went into the store as I was in a hurry and on the phone at the same time. When I came out of the store around 5 minutes later, the 3 amber lights were still there, hovering, not moving since I had gone in the store, in the same exact spot and they looked like they were twinkling. there were 3 distinctive lights. What I noticed was it seem way too large to be a plane on approach to SKY HARBOR {my son and I watch planes on approach all the time} when I was watching it intensely a plane was coming from the west and dwarfed in size to these three lights. If I had to estimate the size I would say 3-4 Jet plane size wise at least. Way to big to be a regular craft. Plus they were AMBER in color, not like any normal craft lights. It was not a helicopter as it was too far to be that big. And they run with white, green and red lights. As I was watching these 3 lights I called my son on the phone to try and see it, but he was in an area that the tree lines near our house blocked the view but because I was at the field at 51st and Olive I could see clearly the area it was hovering at. I stood there for 3-4 minutes watching then I couldn't believe my eyes as the lights started to twinkle brighter then dim then the center light went out first, then the one on the right, then the one on the left. It was not a plane or helicopter, nor was it a craft I have seen at any airshow I have been to in the last 30 years. The lights were in a line next to each other but what was weird is that it was parallel, or slightly above the nearby south mountain lights but not too far above the horizon. about .5 - 10 degrees abov! e the gr ound but more over the estrella mountains side of the southland.  It was not like flares I have seen in the past, it was not like blimps or balloons we see here often in Arizona, it was 3 Amber lights close together but separate.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

The light traveled about 50-75 miles from the time it was spotted to the time the light just faded out and disappeared. The object seem to be traveling quite slow. The object flew right over the flight path of the airport in Phoenix. The reason I know this is I live near there and watch planes land and take off all the time.

Before the start of play with 13:47 on the fourth quarter game clock they show the city skyline of phoenix.  I counted roughly 5 orbs circulating the city and then disappearing all at one time.  It seems very clear they are orbs, not plans, their movement is nothing like plans and they disappear all at once.  At first I thought they were speeding up the film time and they were plans landing, but why did they all disappear at one time.  The pattern they were flying did not seem like plans at all.  I was so alarmed I DVR the rest of the game to record it. Just would like to know what it was I saw.  I've heard of white orbs spotted in Arizona before.  Thanks;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Two falling balls of light---North Phoenix on 10-23-10;2010-10-23 21:00:00;15min;Two falling balls of light---North Phoenix on 10-23-10 My wife and I witnessed what appeared to be two balls of light falling from the sky. Both had white tails that trailed it for a short distance. They both suddenly stopped and hovered.  The were side by side.  Then one light ball goes off. Then the other.  They then go back on again. They repeated this several times.  They hovered for approxiametly 5 minutes. They then slowly traveled north and went behind a mountain. We think we saw them re-appear farther north beyond the mountain where they appeared to just hover for 10 minutes.  We also noted that air traffic seemed to either stop going in that direction or was diverted to east and west.  We'd like to know if anyone else saw this.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

White, red and blue pulses from this singular point.  I then think it may be a plane or helicopter but there is no movement, none at all. It remains very stationary, so it cannot simply be a matter of it moving towards or away from me. use of binoculars provided no better view of the object.  I've noticed this object several times while at a friends home in Scottsdale, but dismissed it at the time. This is very odd indeed.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Pulsating Purple Object in North Phoenix 1-24-2012;2012-01-24 21:00:00;15 minutes;Pulsating Purple Object in North Phoenix 1-24-2012 As I walked out of my work I saw an INTENSE purple pulsating light.  It immediately got the attention of me as well as a few coworkers who were with me. It was completly silent.  It bobbed and weaved in a general vicinity for about 15 minutes before moving over the horizon, where I lost visual contact. The color was the most striking feature of this object.  At times it appeared a solid magenta, but at other times it almost looked like a black light with a blue aura. It seemed like it was about a mile away tops, and about 1000 feet up.  Planes passed by in the background and were MUCH further away.  If it were a plane or helocopter, the engines/rotors should have been easily heard. I initially thought it could have been a balloon tied to the ground bobbing in the wind with a light attached, but as it started moving far from the original spot, towards the horizon and back, far out of the range of a balloon string, I ruled that out. I captured about 5 minutes of footage with my phone.  It conveys the silence and the movement, but falls short on conveying the intense color of the light.  I started filming about a minute or 2 after i spotted it and the video ends about 8 minutes before I lost visual. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJpyArOlPiw&list=UU-ViVnRJYEqpn9TCGjTNIA&index=1&feature=plcp;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Blue/green light floating about Phoenix.;2012-08-15 02:30:00;5-10 minutess;Blue/green light floating about Phoenix A single light that rotated between blue and green, mainly green, floating around the sky, no fast movements, slowly moved any which way, up, down, left to right, eventually floated east until out of sight. Was not a meteor, too slow, and it was very cloudy, was on this side of the clouds. Was not a plane or helicopter, the movement was all over the place not possible with plane or helicopter. Is it possible that it was someone with a laser pointer? Perhaps but it was VERY steady, not sharp movements at all and it really did not look like a laser, there was no beam, just did not look like a laser to me.

I live 5 miles south of sky harbor.  To my amazement there they were!!!  About 20 white orbs. All flying from the west to east.  About 9 orbs broke off and hovered. what looked like to my angle over sky harbor or even a bit more to the north of the airport. so the 9 the broke off. 3 started to form a triangle with one blinking (strobing) fast in the center top of the triangle.  The other 3 try to make what seem to be a other triangle to me facing to the west ( none in this formation where blinking) later these appeared to form in to one orb..  And the other three where just hanging around watching.  Mind you it was cloudy and raining last night. But some of the orbs shined thru the clouds.

I knew this was coming because the launch and catch up has been on the international news/CNN When you described it on Coast to Coast I felt sure that was it I cut & pasted this here this morning from NOAA's  http://www.spaceweather.com  site.  Thanks for the great & dedicated work you do!  ALWAYS a pleasure to hear you hope to make your aquaintance someday at some conference or UFO event. ===========================  SPACE CHASE (Updated): On August 3rd, Japan launched a robotic spacecraft, the HTV-4, to re-supply the International Space Station (ISS). Last night, Larry Sloss saw the HTV-4 in hot pursuit of the ISS in the twilight skies over Priest Lake, Idaho:  The HTV-4 was trailing the ISS by just 3 seconds, says Sloss.  Many observers noted HTV-4 flares this week. Apparently sunlight is glinting off a flat surface of the spacecraft, briefly raising its luminosity to match that of the much larger ISS. Sloss saw one too: In the image, a brief, bright flare from the HTV-4 is slightly offset from the ISS trail.  HTV-4 has an interesting payload.  Among the 5.4 tons of food, spare parts, and other supplies are Kirobo, a talking robot to join the crew of the ISS, and Firestation, an experiment to study mysterious Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes.  Update:  The HTV-4 docked to the space station at 11:38 EDT on Friday, Aug. 9th.  Unloading has commenced.

Amber-Orange light over Phoenix.;2013-08-14 03:33:00;3 minutes;Amber-Orange light over Phoenix This sighting of 1 object, occurred in central Phoenix, at 3:33 am, Wednesday, July (sic.  August) 14, 2013. As I walked outside, I immediately noticed an object due north of my position, approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. Object moved on a west, north-west to east, south-east heading.  When it seemed to be almost overhead, but still slightly east of my position, it executed a smart left turn for a heading of approximately due east. Object, then abruptly slowed, to approximately half it's previous speed.  It almost came to a full stop, but slowly continued on a due east course for about 45 seconds, then began to dim in brightness, until after another 15 to 20 seconds, the light seemed to just “turn off”. Object was a brilliant orange-amber light, about the size of a green pea held at arms length.  The color and intensity were very vivid, and at first dazzling.  It had a similar appearance, and brilliance to the landing flood lights of a passenger jet coming head on, except the color of the light was a very intense amber-orange.  Duration of this sighting was two and a half, to three minutes. I do not think this object was some sort of “flare” tied to a balloon, although that remains a possibility. 3:30 am on a Wednesday morning does not strike me as good timing for a hoax.  Still, the thought did occur to me.  Upon returning inside my home, I examined three internet based weather stations very close to my home. Weather conditions were, lightly scattered clouds, with calm wind conditions.  All three showed wind conditions of 1 mph or less at the time of this sighting, reporting “calm” with no wind direction indicated.  I have archived these weather stations by URL, and by taking screen captures.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Flashing stationary floating UFO over central Phoenix 4 AM.;2013-10-09 04:00:00;15+ minutes;Flashing stationary floating UFO over central Phoenix 4 AM I was driving to work at about 4 AM on I17 southbound.  When I got to Carefree Hwy exit I noticed a stationary flashing light hovering above central Phoenix.  It never changed position as I conntinued toward Phoenix.  I noticed jet airliners coming in to the area as I see a couple of them every morning as I come to work.  This object was higher in altitude than the airplanes on their landing approaches.  Phoenix's Sky Harbor is on the south side of the city and I was on the far north side of the city.  This light flashed like the airplanes but it never changed position.  I was too high to be a helicopter and stayed in the same position for the 15 more minutes it took me to travel to work.

After either heading west or staying in one place (I couldn’t tell), it turned and flew south.  I could still see the light as it traveled at a significantly faster speed than when I saw the light head on.   The object moved significantly faster than a plane and after watching it fly south for a while, the light just went away. Please confirm if anyone else witnessed this.

Bright stationary object in Phoenix.;2015-03-06 22:30:00;30 minutes;Bright stationary object in Phoenix. My brother had spotted a glowing object and had come to get me because he was confused as to what it could be.  At first I figured it was a planet but when I saw it I saw it was much too bright and was slowly moving across the sky.   Very slowly it started moving toward the horizon, so slow that we almost couldn’t tell it was moving, believing it to be our eyes playing tricks on us.  It was very bright, and my brother swore that he saw it shoot up towards the sky which is how it caught his attention in the first place.   We continued to just observe whatever this thing was over the next half hour or so, even climbing on the roof to get a better view.  We had each commented on how the object seemed to be varying in luminosity and to have shown little specks of red blink occasionally.  Again, I must emphasize that it *seemed* to do these thing because we were all staring at it so long that it could very well have been our eyes playing tricks on us.    As we were watching, we noticed that it had slowly shifted its color from a bright, almost star-like, white glow into a deep orange and yellow.  This was for certain, there was no way it was an illusion caused by focusing on something so bright for so long.  Remember, all of this happened over the span of around thirty minutes so the changes were subtle except for the eventual change in color.  It continued to float down towards the horizon and slightly towards what would be north from our perspective.  My brother grabbed his Iphone to use his Starmap app to verify that it was not a planet or star.  It was WAY bigger than anything else I had ever seen, that I suspected was not an aircraft seeing as it was so steady and “floaty”.  One last thing that we remarked on was the fact that it often looked as if it partially blended with the sky.  We thought it could have been something blocking our view but it was only a part of the object at any one time and whenever this occurred the (I want to say distortion) was the exact color of the sky behind it.  It was definitely one of the strangest things I have ever seen.   I do live near both an airforce base and a major airport if that is at all relevant.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Multiple lights hovering in a row North of Phoenix!;2016-01-28 19:30:00;20 minutes;Multiple lights hovering in a row North of Phoenix! On Jan. 28th, 2016 at approx. 7:30 P.M.. I was traveling northbound on Hwy 87, just past Fort McDowell Casino and I spotted 4 lights in a row, as I was looking northwest.  These lights were bright white in front and flashing red lights from side to rear.  After I passed and looked back they were no longer visible, however there were several more ahead of me. While driving, I noticed several vehicles pulled over and people standing on the side of the road staring at the objects which drew my curiosity to watch these lights closer. At first, I assumed they were planes but as I got closer I noticed that the lights seem to break off and stretched for miles of approx. 12-15 bright lights in a straight line. Roughly 200 ft. west of Hwy 87 and approx. 500 feet above ground. I didn’t become suspicious until about the 6th light that I passed, I then pulled over about a mile before Bush Hwy exit and got out of vehicle, it was very quiet, no sound and objects remained very still, hovering.  I tried to capture a picture but it only looked like a bright dot (crappy cell phone camera). After approx. 5 minutes of watching these objects remain motionless, thoughts began to run through my head, as I was trying to rationalize what these were, drones, planes, or military crafts etc. My only logical conclusion was UFO’s which prompted me to get back into the vehicle and drive away, heading northbound on highway 87. While driving past the Sugar-loaf/4 Peaks turn off, I spotted several other lights hovering east and west of the highway.  There was 2 remaining lights in front of me.  After I passed the second light, I didn’t see any more and that concludes my sighting.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

I work for a very big aerospace company and I am very aware of many type of aircraft. At 9:19 on Saturday night I saw a light flying in a north direction. It was a bright light with a slow movement, as I noticed it, it started to slowly dim. It was not a meteor, I've seen lots of meteors and this was too slow to be a meteor. It was not a plane, as it did not have any flashing lights, nor was it a satellite, since it dimmed. It was a clear night without a cloud in the sky. It seemed as if it knew I was watching it and that's when it began to dim. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from an Iridium satellite?  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Heading in the north-west direction.  A mysterious green light that I saw as going in an upwards flight so fast it was gone within a few seconds.  Only one green object to be seen heading away from me. Reason for being up the mountain so late was because I had just got off work, and walked home.  Instead of going straight home, I had gone to the mountain to see the city lights which are very beautiful and night.  I could see just about the whole city of Phoenix, Arizona.  This flying object of the unknown was  more north I think heading straight to Nevada.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

I noticed as I was watching the show an unexplained occurrence with a fast traveling light coming from the left right above the city lights at an extremely fast speed compared to the traffic on the highway below it traveled quickly towards the right of the tv screen then came to an abrupt stop and dropped to the road level slowly did a complete 360 and traveled back towards the left at a southwest angle.  I and several others have watched this footage over and over the only explanation we can figure out is that it could truly be a sighting! Granted I know that only the producers and editors of this show know when and where this footage they used was really captur! ed on tape and was used at this particular time on the making of Season One / Episode Five of American Monster.

3 Moving Lights with Large Trails in Phoenix form a Triangle in the Night Sky;2016-07-02 21:03:00;~3 minutes;3 Moving Lights with Large Trails in Phoenix form a Triangle in the Night Sky Lights Over Phoenix, AZ July 2nd, 2016 9:03 PM 	I was sitting on my patio in south Scottsdale near Oldtown, when I heard a loud bang.  As I looked up towards the North West I noticed the 3 objects falling in unison.  I first thought that maybe 2 aircrafts had collided in the sky and these objects were falling debris on fire.  I started to record a video and as doing so the trailing lighted objects proceeded to move along different flight patterns, even turning and changing direction.  The altitude was way too high to be fireworks and the patterns of the lights made me think about potential rockets or missiles.  However, rockets and missiles move at a much larger rate of speed.  I’m a veteran of the U.S. Army that worked in avionics and with the knowledge I have over the Hellfire missile there’s little that relates for it to be classified as such.  There is a lot I still do not know on the subject though.  Nothing as far as I can tell makes any sense. 	I’m an avid reader of science-fiction and do believe in the possibility of many lifeforms in the universe, even intelligent life.  This is the only experience I’ve had first hand. Towards the end of my recording my roommate happens to come out and witness the lights and their maneuvers through the sky as well.  I would describe the lights to have a yellowish tint and large sparking trails following them.  Around the 40 second mark you’ll see the bottom light start to change directions more rapidly than the rest of the video with clear visibility of the trail of light behind it.  Then around the 1:01 mark all 3 lights come back and form a triangular shape in the sky.  Excuse my language in the commentary at this point too. 	Like I have stated this is my first experience with something I believe to be supernatural and I’m not sure if all the information you need is provided.  If there are any questions or need any follow up I’m more than happy to help. I immediately uploaded my video to social media, but for ease of access here is the link to the video I’ve now posted to Youtube.  https://youtu.be/wVpXssN0VK0  	Thank you for your time.

About 15-20 minutes after the flight left Phoenix at 6:30pm MST, a bright light appeared on the left side of the aircraft.  According to the flight parameters available via the onboard Wi-Fi, the plane was flying at 528 mph (ground speed) and ay 38000 ft.  The light appeared off the left side of the aircraft and appeared to be about 1,000 feet away.  The light would move up and down vertically throughout most of the flight.  Even as the plane adjusted course, the light did not vary.  Other stars in the background appeared to move as the plane headed towards Sacramento.  As the plane descended for landing and went through the cloud layers, the light faded in and out.

Because they were traveling across the sky in a type of convoy (for lack of a better term), I could see as many as 4 at one time. Since I knew that the sun had set an hour or so earlier, I assumed that what I was seeing was sunlight reflecting off of them. This seemed to be the case since as they tracked to the northeast, they faded out. There wasn't any sound or aircraft marker lights.
