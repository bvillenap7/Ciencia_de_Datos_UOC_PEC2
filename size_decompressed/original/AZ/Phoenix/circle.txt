The objects shined bright red with a flickering pattern. when I zoomed my camera phone in the object appeared to look like exploding red fireworks and the image never changed until they disappeared. they became less bright the closer they got to the moon and then poof. they were gone one after the other with never more than 3 of the objects visible at a time. No sound or wild movements. just flickering red lights during the local neighborhoods firework display. They was much higher than the fireworks so there was no mistake in what we saw.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
