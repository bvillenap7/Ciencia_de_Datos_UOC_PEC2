Changed shape rapidly, and disapered into the darkness in a burst of light. The sun was going down, the moon coming over the horizon. My friend was in from California, and we had just finished dinner. We decided to go out and have a cigarette and watch the sun go down. My friend said he heard thunder, but I said that was impossible, but I looked to the sky anyway. A brilliant flash of light knocked us both to the ground, and we looked up,  covered our eyes because of the light, and saw to rotating silver  craft. They changed shape rapidly to what looked like a giant black triangle. The first craft emitted a beam that lifted a 40 foot cactus out of the ground and fix the sand so the earth looked untouched. We then heard a deafening roar which we both assumed was the craft communicating with each other, they then both exploded into a brilliant display of colored light, and in the same way they came they were gone. My friend got up, lit another smoke, and said Well Rick, this is really one for the books. I have since moved to New York because I just got to thinking that too many of these UFO sightings take place in the desert. I still keep in contact with my friend, and this always come up in conversation.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Objects sited in residential area appeared to combine and separate as if liquid form.;1999-02-15 10:30:00;20 min;Objects sited in residential area appeared to combine and separate as if liquid form. At approxamatly 10:30 am Phoenix time an object appeared to be floating in a residential area of Tempe, AZ.  This object was observed from a tenth story office.  At first a single object appeared.  This object appeared to be a black balloon floating, but rotating. The color remained black and occasionally reflected the sun light.  Suddenly the object decended rapidly.  The object reappeared after a couple of seconds and returned to its original altitude.  Another object appeared, similar size and shape, shortly after and merged, combined (as if liquid form).  The objects separated once and the lower portion decended once again.  The remaining object continued at the same altitude and appeared to change shape frequently as it rotated.  This object then decended for a brief time.  The two objects then reappeared, one above and one below the other, and continued to rise and disapeared straight up.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
The night before I saw The Ship My Freind called me out to see a fast moving object orangr in color Move ocroos the sky faster than eve;1999-10-28 17:55:00;20 Minutes;The night before I saw The Ship My Freind called me out to see a fast moving object orangr in color Move ocroos the sky faster than even a comit or meteor.I Ran out but I could not see it in time.The next night 10/28 My freind automatically was drawn outside {Almost like it was a given like a Dashavo)As he called me outside to look at it This time my instinct told me something was about to be seen.Sure enough I saw a red diamond.It was shooting red sparks from the top and was morhping into all different shapes very slowly.It Went from a red diamond discharging sparks from the top.Then it changed to a rod type shape or bowling pin and then finally saw it turn into a black triangle as it moved at about 10miles per houraway fom us at that point.It had a dim white glowing aura that surrounded it and as it changed shapes it seem to distort the atmostphere around it.I new it was not a balloon or flares because it made a 150 mile uturn  first slowly descending then slowly ascending to about 50,000 feet tip of the jetstream.By this point it beacame a a small star size white dot and it stayed in stationary position for 10 minutes.I used A telephone pole to to see that it was stationary.It then went even higher up in the stratusphere and slowly moved towards california.Ithought it most odd there wasnt an airplane small or large in sight in the sky. Highly ironic because I live where you can always see  planes all the time at 5:55 in the sky.Just about a week earlier before the sighting we had an earthquake wich is highly rare for phoenix.The whole event of seeing the ship seemed strange like you were watching some kind of sourcery or magic show.It was very unatural and not of this dimension.As it moved away from us it apeared to go 2 moves forward and then onemove backwards like stretching out a ruuberband.It almost looked like it was emmitting some kind of magnetic aura about it.6 months earlier using the jon bro technique i photographed a rod as big as a city.towards california.phoenix is a definite hot spot r! ight now for ufos.I dont know why phoenix but it semms to be a cental geographically locacation for dispursment of craft.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Two small objects float over the runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.;2000-04-15 12:25:00;20 minutes;Two small objects float over the runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. My friend and I were waiting to board a plane at Phoenix Airport, noon, looking out at South Mountain, two small objects floated over the runway. At first they appeared to be like sheets of paper rolling in the wind or a foil birthday balloon.  They were above the backdrop of South Mountain so it was hard to judge the size or distance.  They seemed to float like small white baloons.  I followed their path looking out the window while walking to the end of the terminal.  As they floated away to tiny white spots in the sky, one drifted away, but one stayed. I could judge position by seeing the roof of the terminal looking almost straight up. It held that position for 10 min. I went to get my camera and came back (30 sec.) to find it was gone. (I thought ok maybe just balloons.) I went to the next set of windows to keep searching looked up and there were 2 objects again, this time closer and lower in the horizon. They held that position for another 5 min with out moving.  (I thought cool a pair of ufos).  I watched for a while and looked away for maybe 30 seconds. I looked again and one was gone!  The other just floated off in the distance after another 5 minutes.. I snapped a couple of pictures but there is probably not a lot to see. Two aircraft at high altitude at different times crossed the field of view close to the objects. Nothing spectacular but worth noting.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Strangely silent object streaks accross sky in desert southwest.;2001-03-25 03:30:00;about 30 secs;Strangely silent object streaks accross sky in desert southwest. At about 3:30am (MST) I let my dog out back, then I went into the house to put a slice of pizza in the microwave. As the pizza was warming I went outside to join my dog, and when I walked outside I noticed something moving accross the sky. At first I was confused by what I was watching, because I couldn't quite make out it's shape. At first it appeared to look round, kind of saucer shaped, then as it moved it looked almost cigar shaped. Suddenlly after moving about three quarters of the way accross the sky it's shape appeared more cheveron like. I should note that the backyard is on the north side of our property, so I was looking at this facing north. There was this strange silence to everything as the object flew accoss the sky, almost as if the object was sucking in the sound like a vacuum as it went by. The object had no lights, or light pattern on it, yet it was somewhat luminous. It seemed to be white, almost siver in color. The object flew from east to the southwest at about a 60 degree angle from the horizon, and that's the opposite direction of the flight pattern of the commercial air traffic in the area. It should also be noted that I live approximatly two and a half miles from Sky Harbor Intl Airport, so I know the flight patterns of the aircraft in the night sky. This object appeared to be rather large, and to be flying at about 8,000 to 10,000 feet in alltitude. It swept accross the sky at a speed at least 3 to 4 times faster than anything else in the sky. The object disappeared into the night sky to the south, southwest as fast as it had appeared in the east. The whole time of the sighting couldn't have been more than 30 seconds. After losing sight of the object I could once again hear the sounds of the other objects in the sky.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
rising balloon transformed into cigar craft with red light on bottom.;2001-11-12 23:33:00;2minutes;Rising balloon transformed into cigar craft with red light on bottom   At 11:33 p.m. on November 11, 2001 I as putting my backpack in my car, that was running in the driveway.  After closing the back door to the car I looked up to reach to open the front driver door. That was when I noticed a dull grey colored small birthday party balloon with string below. It was rising at a normal helium balloon speed and appartently coming from the neighbors, 3 houses down, backyard.  After noticing the lights all off at their home and no car in the driveway I was suspicious of how it had come from that backyard that was dark and silent.  Then, without my perceptive ability to actually see the transition, it was now instantly a dull grey cigar shaped craft about 50 feet up above the houses.  It was not a balloon anymore yet retained the same color and underneath the hull of this silent and now motionless craft was a rectangular shaped protrusion of sorts that was obviously a part of the craft's geometry. In the right corner of this short protruding box-like bottom was a brilliant, almost like DIGITAL/LED square light.  The light blinked on and off with no apparent pattern and the object was the size of 3 or 4 mini-vans worth of mass in the sky from the distance I saw it.  It slowly moved horizontally over to be closer to me standing there and remained still nearly over head for a near full minute.  Then it began accelerating in a northwesterly direction at a calm speed remaining at its altitude consistently eversince ceasing to rise upward during its time as a balloon of helium. In shock I documented the event within minutes and then before leaving after only a few minutes past the event an appartent police helicopter, ghetto bird swept low over that spot of the neighborhood doing a typical orbit around the house I was at with its spotlight on, but not pointing down at me or anything and after one full circle it flew around me there, in a diameter of about 300 yards and height near the same as the craft, the helicopter then sped off in the exact direction that what I had seen left from there traveling in.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Stealth Object Creeping Over Phoenix.;2004-08-12 22:25:00;30 seconds;Stealth Object Creeping Over Phoenix I was standing on my back patio looking due east into a partly cloudy sky when a dome shaped object that looked EXACTLY like a very small piece of cloud went flying by at a speed of about 300 knots.  Its trajectory was north to south at an altitude of about 1000 feet AGL.  The object was flying level straight in open sky and was approaching a cloudbank.  Just before it reached the clouds it morphed instantly from a 'dome' shape into a 'diamond wedge' and seem to become more transparent, disappearing into the clouds all together.  This was no rogue cloud caught in a fluke wind stream it flew with a purpose and sense of stealth.  Its flight path was directly under Sky Harbor's approach route and a commercial airliner flew over a few minutes later.  I estimated the size of the object to be that of 2- 3 jumbo jets in length and height.  My girlfriend also witnessed the object and was as stunned as I. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS--MAY 03, 2010.)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Almost 5 years ago I filed a report with NUFORC concerning a cloud shaped/textured object over Phoenix.  Tonight I had some free time and thought I would (after all these years) go back and visit my report.  I was shocked to see that it had been labeled a 'HOAX.'  I can't tell you what I saw that night, but myself and my wife DID see something very strange as described in the report.   In the spirit of truth and disclosure I would please ask you remove the 'HOAX' tag, as this was an honest and accurate report. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) Boise, ID http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/038/S38625.html ((END ADDENDUM));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
3 objects sited 90 miles SW of Phoenix;2005-05-19 10:35:00;15 MINUTES;3 objects sited 90 miles SW of Phoenix I was driving from California to Phoenix on I-10 when I noticed a large orange object.  It was very low in the sky, just above the hills.  It must have been over 10 miles away because it's position never seemed to vary with respect to my car.   While I was watching it, another object appeared to rise out of the top of the first one.  Both were very large,about the size of a thumbnail on an outstretched arm.  After a few minutes, a third object appeared, blinked-out, and then re-appeared.  All three objects then hovered for about 3 minutes.   I kept looking for a road that might head out to them so I could get a closer look and a picture.  I finally pulled off on Hofsetter Rd. and stopped about 100 yards away from the freeway.  I opened my trunk to get my digital camera and when I got ready to take a video- they were gone. Very frustrating.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Changing shapes and colors It was about 1:00 am, I had laid down with crying daughter and I was looking out her bedroom window and I saw an object in the sky.  Pretty lights, thought it was a plane for a minute, until I realized it wasn't moving.   It hovered there, it looked as if at one moment was a circle and lights where illuminating all around and the next minute it was cigar shaped with the lights coming off was brighter and longer. I yelled for my roommates to come and look.  ((male name deleted)), one roomate, looked and ran outside to see.  Four of us went outside and saw it.  Srill illuminating the lights and changing shapes.   It made a slow but steady pace towards the west.  I have never seen anything like this, red, blue white and a few times yellow lights coming off the object.  We watched the object for about 45 minutes and it seemed to travel further away.

Moved across the city of  Phoenix in just a few seconds.;2010-05-07 12:00:00;7 seconds;Moved across the city of  Phoenix in just a few seconds. It looked like a white and silver flashing object.  It was small, very high up and it disappeared into thin air.  It moved across the sky (city) in just a few seconds. Immediately following its disappearance... I saw three jets flying near the area in which it disappeared.  It may have been the same jet circling. I'm not sure! Because of the distance and speed... it was very difficult to make out it's exact shape because it was constantly changing back and forth from one shape or another, as well as from white to silver.  At first I thought it was a very big, white and silver bird... until I saw it moving extremely fast and then it just completely disappeared.  Immediately following it's disappearance a helicopter flew in the area as well as the jet planes.  There are no clouds today.  Also, please note that birds do not generally fly as high as the object was at.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Blue UFO Over ASU West;2011-05-07 23:45:00;20 mins;Blue UFO Over ASU West I first witnessed a blue light moving around in the sky off to the northwest.  It moved around like a RC Helicoper (sort of wobbley).  Then my two brothers and a friend came out and they saw it as well and had the same opinion.  It kept moving down in the same part of the sky and then back up.  It would move to the west and then back to the same spot where it would raise and decend.  Then it just appeared in the sky high above were it decended and disappeared.  Then about midnight I was driving home with my brother and we both saw this thing moving back and forth changing shape.  It was over the ASU West parking lot at 43Ave and Thunderbird.  I was driving so I could only take side glances at it while driving.  It looked sort of like someone was flying a two cord kite that had a bright blue 400W light attached to it (if this was a hoax or someone who had a bizare hobbie of flying kits at night).  It seemed to change shape while it moved back and forth.  I ju! st wondered if anyone else saw this wierd blue light over ASU West?;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

7 craft seen over N Phoenix, erratic, blinking, changing shapes;2012-07-28 20:30:00;30 minutes;7 craft seen over N Phoenix, erratic, blinking, changing shapes July 27, 2012: Note: Phoenix, AZ time. At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO’s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO’s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert in North Phoenix near Cave Creek, AZ. and always enjoy the view. The mountains and horizon looked like a postcard and the horizon was purplish blue. As I gazed up at the sky, I noticed that there were a lot of trails crossing the sky. In fact, the sky was full of them. And there seemed to be a gigantic X in the sky where two of the largest ones crossed each other. My husband and I thought that this was very odd indeed. On further reflection, it seemed that the X marked a meeting spot. Then we noticed that coming from the north, very high in the horizon, what appeared at first to be a plane was not a plane at all. It was soundless, for one thing and moved erratically.  I could not believe my eyes. It jumped around sporadically in a fashion that no plane is capable of doing. As it jumped, it blinked, and then it hovered, waiting. Why was it waiting?  Then we noticed that an actual plane ( or what seemed at first to be a plane) was some distance from it but seemed to have some connection with this object as well as the other unidentified flying objects. This first one would not continue on its path until the plane- or what appeared to be a plane- turned off its lights. At that point, the object flew in a southernly direction in a slightly more normal path though at no time did any of them have the noise of a plane. This happened several times. We saw seven of them, and they did not all appear to be exactly the same though they all did act in an erratic fashion. Some had orangish lights and some had greenish lights. Some were bigger than others and seemed to have lights that blinked as if they were  rotating discs. The smallest of these were more cigar or bullet shaped and the size of a plane, but two seemed to be much larger. One was in the shape of a triangle. We watched fascinated. Before we left, one of the very largest ones first hovered and then headed in the opposite direction. It first headed closer to us and then followed us across the street like a low flying plane above the trees which made me feel quite uneasy indeed. Except for the last one, we lost sight of all objects over the horizon or they seemed to just disappear. Also, while this was going on at one point we looked at the moon and it was clear. Five minutes later there was a distinct trail across it- like a long line. There were no lights moving in the area. If it was created by a chemtrail in the area, then the flying object had no lights as we saw nothing saw cross the moon. It is odd that they all came from the same exact place and seemingly from out of nowhere.  We watched them as they appeared. My husband  now suggests it was perhaps from the area of 51 Las Vegas. They all headed in the same direction ( seemed to be Goldwater Preserve SW of Phoenix). We could not identify any landing. One flew back to the point of origin, inexplicably. The rest, five, continued on out of our sight except for the last one which followed us. It seemed to be a convoy mission of some sort ( some escorting others into the area that they were all headed).  The “plane” that shut its lights off and then on from the object waiting to make its flight seemed to be giving it a signal to pass. Also, not only was their behavior bizarre (hovering and stationary and then deep ascents or descents), soundless, and erratic, but they appeared to have come from a much greater distance than a plane possibly could. When they first appeared, they seemed to be brighter than the brightest star, so perhaps that gives some indication of size and distance. It seems as if they came out of thin air and were at first at a much greater distance. In fact, at first they looked star like, then like several  bright points that jumped around a bit( to get stabilized?) and then, coming closer (it appeared) into our atmosphere, you could detect some type of shape with lights (green or red) at the bottom of the unidentified flying object.  They all moved noiselessly unlike planes and were able to move in a manner unlike any plane. We did not take our eyes off of them, but I had the creepy feeling with some of them that they were trying to approximate the look of a plane once they began to f! ly in the same southwesterly direction. However, planes do not shut their lights off or hover and come to a standstill, planes do not come out of nowhere as far away as a star then jump in inexplicable patterns, and planes do not fly noiselessly.  I was not sure whether or not they actually changed their shape or the shape came into focus as it came closer. My husband and I are serious, well-educated, and professional people and have no reason to be making this up.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

It had red energy that ran through At 1:00a.m. my son and I went out to walk the dog.  He had seen this event the night before also when he walked the dog alone.  Up in the sky was this translucent blue and white looking circular light.  As we spoke about it and to it, an orange/red light ran through it as if it could tell we were speaking to it.  It would morph into a cylinder light.  I wonder if it were moving around or spinning.  It would get long and thin and then become round again. It would pulsate also when we were talking so it looked like the lights were blinking in it.  It was difficult to get an exact shape.  It split a couple of times or appeared to.  It moved up and over to the right as we walked the dog around.   We went back inside as I wanted to share this with you.  It was almost like a living entity, like it responded.  I got a little scared for a second and it grew dimmer.  As I relaxed it got brighter like it was proud or communicating.  One thing interesting.  We walk our dog about 5-10 minutes at a time.

Shapeshifting orb hovering through chemtrails over downtown Phoenix.;2015-09-30 06:03:00;08:10;Shape-shifting orb hovering through chemtrails over downtown Phoenix. The first object, a bright light in the eastern  morning sky (resembled a planet or star).  A second object located northeast of first object is smaller, dimmer, and appears flat. The first object moved slow with slight variable speeds and directions, then it appeare to change shapes. On 3 separate occasions it appeared to spin around, I saw what I though were uneven edges. After the  spin around, the object would split in half, separate for a moment and then return to fit perfectly togethere.  I clearly saw this 3 times. The second object is getting smaller and eventually is not visible. At this time at least 4  large planes flew in from the east across the central phoenix area flying closely to the object which now resembles an orb, spraying chemtrails around the orbs area.  I saw the orb fly above, below and through the chemtrail. Within 10 minutes I was not able to see the orb again. But, now we  have 3 large XXX shaped chemtrails clearly marking the city.

Strange light or object in North Phoenix sky;2016-03-30 23:00:00;5-10 minutes;Strange light or object in North Phoenix sky It was 10:59 pm on 03/30/2016. I was sitting out back having a smoke. And just to the North of where we stay.  Is another apartment building which you see in the photos i sent.  Now what captured my attention was the light captured was flashing which I could see very clearly with my eyes.  And it had a orange color to it which made it stand out even more.  When I retrieved my camera and picked up the light. Clearly like I had mentioned before the light was indeed flashing on my photo screen which made it much more clearer to notice.  Now in the photos there are 2 lights you will see in the center of the screen.  The lower one being almost center with the other light just above it and to the right a bit.  The lower light you see is actually some piece of the roof top that is to the north of us which you see in the photo as well.  So the light that is above the one I just mentioned is the one that has me stuck on stupid. The photos were taken one after another.  And somehow the light or object in question when you zoom closer to it.  Seems to change shape or form from one photo to the next.  And not only that in every photo in the middle of whatever it is.  Is a very bright energy source or light that is really strange.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Friday the 27th of May at 10pm noticed a light flashing in the sky NE of Phoenix;2016-05-27 22:00:00;30 minutes;Friday the 27th of May at 10pm noticed a light flashing in the sky NE of Phoenix I was standing outside having a cigerett around 10:00 pm on Friday May 27th.  When I noticed a light at around 2 o clock just NE.  It looked like a star but as I kept looking it was changing colors frequently.  So i began to snap photos of the object one after the other.  Then when I got to looking at the a few minutes later.  Is when I noticed everyone of the pictures that shows the object with a haze around it.  And as i continue to go through the photos. I came across at least three or four photos where the object seperates and clearly can see two objects.  Also in the photos pick up the object with a purple light.  And in other photos a blue light.  And in others a light blue with green which is very puzzling.  One other thing to mention is normally a light or object is picked up much easier on my phone while recording video opposed to shooting a picture.  And for some odd reason when I shot video don't seem to get anything.  But the first 8 seconds I recorded a lig! ht that moves across my screen from right to left which is very strange.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Monday May 30th NE Phoenix, 7th Street and Paradise LN.;2016-05-30 21:00:00;30 minutes;Monday May 30th NE Phoenix, 7th Street and Paradise Ln. That night, I noticed what looked like a star.  But seem much closer and could see light variations with the naked eye.  As I washed for a couple of minutes.  I thought it was still to strange, so I began taking photos.   Now the object in question will be almost center of the screen about a inch from the top.  As you scroll through the photos.  Another object will appear below the one in question.  Below it to the left at first.  Then will move across from left to right this being a plane.  Once again the object in question will be the one in the same place in almost all the photos.   If in doubt look at the photos where i changed the contrast and so forth making the object in question stand out to you in case your wondering.   The photos were taken one after the other as quick as my finger hit the button. I guess that's why I am so baffled from one photo to the next.  How the obhect in question change so much.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Cyl. silver obj. approached, then receded, then changed shape..began to sparkle then drift away to WSW.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-19 18:45:00;5 minutes;Cylindrical silver object approached then receded, then changed shape..began to sparkle then drift away to the west southwest. I was driving west on US-60 on trip to Sky Harbor Airport and noticed a bright silvery cylinder shaped object over, I believe, South Chandler.  I was in the distance... Based on a thin cloud bank I would place the altitude at about 8000' so it must have been large.  I first saw it at the 10 o'clock position.  I first thought that it was sunlight on a jet contrail, but as it became larger I thought that it may be a plane on approach to the Mesa Gateway Airport... then it began to recede to the southwest... I almost wrecked the car trying to watch it.   There have got to be hundreds of witnesses, because it was very prominent... It then drifted back into the thin cloud layer and I thought it was gone, but it was bright enough to shine through...  Then from a cylinder it then appeared as two equally sized globes just touching each other...  I had to watch my driving so looked away briefly and thought it had moved away, but you could still see it behind the thin cloud... at one point it appeared to emit a curving smoke trail... then that stopped and the two globes began to sparkle...  I again resumed driving.... the next time I had a chance to look up it was gone... There absolutely have to be other witnesses to this.  It was still daylight and this thing was prominently in view.  This thing was bizarre.  I checked today's local news.... nothing... but then saw a video on you-tube that showed it... Only at the point where it was two globes. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to 3/20/17 submittal regarding the 3/19/17 incident...  The cylinder was situated at a 30% tilt, higher side to the left.  Object's length was approximately 7 times its width.  US 60 runs exactly east/west... this object was at the 10 o'clock position. It was nearly sunset.  There are always contrails in the very busy skies...they were all orange and this object was silvery white.  The spheres that It turned into were pretty much the same width as the cylinder appearance, but occupied 1/4 the length of the original cylinder.  It is possible that it was two cylinders side by side that turned so as to make it appear as two spheres... just a guess.  The object stayed double-sphere in appearance until it receded to the southwest... emitted a sinuous smoke emission from the left side of the left sphere which dispersed almost immediately... the object was receding slowly... then it began to sparkle with lights brighter than the initial silvery white appear! ance…  I looked away for not more than 10 seconds...when I looked back it was no longer visible.  It is impossible than no one else saw this... as it was fairly large with an apparent width of your index finger at arms length at its narrowest and was slightly larger upon my initial observation.  I am a major sky watcher, and I am certain this had no astronomical explanation. Bizzare… ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Appeared to be floating horizontally, then stopped for awhile, then moved North.  Very high in the sky.  Visible along with Moon.  The shape was hard to discern.  It appeared to be red in the middle with an orange glow around it.  Appeared like a cross at one point and seemed to be rotating. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

3 bright sphere / orb objects over Phoenix Metro area;2021-07-04 20:10:00;2-3 min;3 bright sphere / orb objects over Phoenix Metro area On Sunday, July 4, 2021 at approximately 8 PM I was driving my vehicle in Scottsdale, a suburb of Phoenix traveling northbound on a very populated though fare. N. Hidden Rd. I turned left onto E. Indian School Rd. in Scottsdale. As I made my turn and look to head up to my left I noticed three spherical objects that were very bright in the early sunset. All three seem to have her momentarily and then move in unison. Within a few moments one of the spheres would loop out information and disappear, and then within seconds reappear at a different position within the formation. This happened approximately three or four times within the span of 2 to 3 minutes. Then, one by one each individual sphere just vanished.  All three spears were the same color and did not change color. They were very bright yellow slight amber color. They made no sound as they moved there was no cloud displacement. It was as if they were doing a bit of a dance or a routine. They appeared to be in the area west of my location which would put them approximately over the eastern portion of Phoenix potentially close to Phoenix sky Harbor Airport. My location at the time and I witnessed the event was approximately 5 miles south east of the Phoenix sky Harbor Airport.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
