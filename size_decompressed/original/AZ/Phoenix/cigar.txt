Large dark moving void in the night sky over Phoenix, Arizona;1977-04-15 21:00:00;2 minutes;Large dark moving void in the night sky over Phoenix, Arizona My father and I were in our backyard in Phoenix, Arizona, (high population city) on a clear night and noticed above and in front of us we couldn’t see the stars in a very large area of the sky.  We noticed by the stars disappearing in front of the object and reappearing behind that it was moving.  There were no flashing lights and no sound.  We had seen blimps over Phoenix that covered sporting events and they are very loud.  Also this was much larger than any conventional craft I had ever seen,  If it was a craft.  We could not see any structure.(estimate, 400 yards long x 250 yards wide)  No one in the neighborhood said they saw it and no mention in the news. My father a very logical man never wanted to talk about it over the years ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
I waked out my back door and saw something that looked like the Hindenberg zepplin.;1997-02-11 11:00:00;10 min.;I waked out my back door and saw something that looked like the Hindenberg zepplin. Itwas a cool windy day with cottonball clouds blowing from west to east. I went outside to enjoy looking at the clouds. I noticed what apeared to be a silver blimp. It was just sitting there motionlss in a 20mph wind. The object was approx. a half mile from me at the time.Then it turned and headed in my direction or west at a slow speed. it passed right in front of me at about 200 feet. It was about 300 feet long and 60 feet in diameter,there were no seams or openings on the craft and no gondola. It made no noise and moved effortlesly into the wind.The aircraft then turned north and headed away from me, picking up speed as it went. From behind it looked round in shape. Then it accelerated to great speed and was out of sight within 30seconds. I have seen strange lights before but this time I saw the object in broad daylight and right in front of me.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
The object appeared as a bright star in the northeastern sky from Chandler AZ;1998-05-29 05:10:00;2:25;follow up on prior report 4 June 1998 Follow up on the object spotted 29 May 1998. The object appeared as a bright star in the northeastern sky from Chandler AZ on the morning of 29 may 1998, 05:10 hours. Object remain stationary from first sighting until after 07:35 hours. Object was gone at 08:00 hours. Object was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. One arm length and the width of the hand plus extended thumb. A ratio of approximately  1 to 4 (or .25).  This elevation remained unchanged even after I got to work where I easily spotted the object in what I assumed to be the same location. The line of sight distance to work is 7 miles to the southwest. This means, as the elevation was essentially unchanged, the object was at a considerable distance. At least 40 miles I'd guess. The object appeared to displace about one eight inch. That is the gap between the index finger and the thumb at arms length. That would be about what you'd get from a street light at about a 100 feet.  The object appeared elongated in the north south direction and I would guess was at least 1000 feet long.  It appear to be white in color. note: sighted an object up close 03:40hrs  13 Oct. 1997 went over the road a head of me.

What was that cigar shaped object ?;2003-05-27 22:10:00;10 minutes;What was that cigar shaped object ? It was a very clear night at about 10:10 p.m. and I was hungry.  I decided to go to an Circle K store which was nearby where we lived.  Without disclosing exactly where I live,  all I can say is that I live nearby Mountain, on the south side.  When I went outside to my car something attracked my attention that I thought it was an helicopter hovering low.  We get many helicopter rescues due to people climbing this Mtn. and they either get stuck or fall and injure themselves.  I looked up at this cigar shaped just hovering there, the lights of the object had attracted my attention and it was hardly moving at all.  There were pinpoint lights alongside of it enough to show that it was a cigar shaped.  I watched it for at least ten minutes if not more, trying to make sense of it, and to make out the exact location of where it was hovering over.  It was hovering North of the Mtn., seemed to be at an height of at least 800 to a thousand feet.  I'm not good at distances but it was close enough for me to rule out that  it was not a plane, helicopter, hot-air balloons and a blimp.  We get blimps flyover during certain times of the year depending on the events.  We have airliners flying over and the airport is about 2 1/2 miles south of where I saw this object.  As I watched this object I observed some of the pinpoint bright lights sometimes flickering.  At the ends of the cigar shaped object there were slightly larger red lights.  It never moved, made noise, it just hung in there the whole time I watched it.  The lights around where I was did not interfere my sight since my house lights were off and the street lights are a distance away.  Then suddenly at about at least during the ten minutes I was watching it .. it just took off upright toward the sky so fast and but it seemed like it just disappeared as it zoomed off.  I went to the Circle K and there was a man standing at the corner of the store, staring at the same area where I saw this object.  I ignored him and went inside the Circle K store! After I bought some items and came outside, he was still waiting at the corner still looking up at the sky and my car was parked next to him.  He was very quiet and seemed a bit shook up.  As I was starting to get into the car the man asked me if I had seen anything strange.  I asked him why do you ask me?  He said he's familiar with me since I come to the store often, and assumed I lived nearby.  I asked what does that have to do with my living nearby.  He said 'you had to have seen it, you just gotta have to seen that thing, it was just there and then it took off'.  I told him, whether if I had seen it or not, no body would believe it anyway.  I admitted I did see it but I didn't go into details, I just got into my car and went home.  All that night, I laid outside in my lounger, watching the sky, wondering if it'd come back which it didn't.  I know what I saw was real but I can't explain it since of all the airliners, blimps and hot air balloons I've never seen anything like it except, last week I was watching a TV show and it was about UFO's.  I was shocked to see the portion of the show where the daughter (in Colorado) goes outside to play and she saw this cigar shaped thing in the sky, called for her father, and he had video taped it.  The object I saw was so similiar to that object seen in Colorado, except it was closer.  This is the absolute truth to what I saw and it's real unless this is some secret government flying object of some sort.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Close encounter of the third kind;2003-05-31 13:00:00;5-10 seconds;Close encounter of the third kind On May 31st, 2003 around 13:00 as I was getting ready for work, I had gone outside to a tree in our backyard to stretch my back by grabbing a large branch and hang from it.   I looked down to make sure that my feet were off the ground.  Seeing that I was clear of the ground, I then looked up towards the branch. There between my hands and my face and the branch was a small - about the size of my pinkie - cigar shaped object.  It was chrome colored but seemed to have a light smoke tint to it.  I stared at the object feeling the more I did perhaps I could see into it.  I could not. When I thought of reaching out to touch it - the object - it moved away from me through the leaves silently and left my sight. I have not seen it since.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Confused and concerned - what is happening to me? Seems out of my control.;2005-04-14 23:30:00;5 minutes;Confused and concerned - what is happening to me?  Seems out of my control. (3) large cigar shaped crafts with blue - yellow illuminators on tips (each side) with dimmer light at the center. Moved slow then fast in up and down and side to side motion (in full formation). I first thought maybe I was seeing 3 helicopters - no way possible.  After coming to a complete stop and hovering at a distance of approximately 1 quarter mile to my north departed at a great speed - very fast. I had a very bad headache for about 5 - 10 minutes after there departure to the northwest and almost felt somewhat disoriented. I also suffered severe vomiting a couple hours later at my residence with a blood colored vomit.  My wife also discovered several dry skin patches on my back (red circular markings).  This same or similar occurence took place with me while working in southern New Mexico (Playas,NM) as a Deputy Sheriff for the Hidalgo County, NM Sheriff's Department in 1999. I told nobody due to being considered crazy or strange - happened again this week (not crazy).  I am willing to take polygraph test if you wish. Has anybody else experienced this type of incident? I am a little spooked - I have never reported this type of event before.  Thank you for your time and help on this matter.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Glowing Cigar  over the Lake Pleasnat ranges.;2008-07-15 19:45:00;10 MINUTES;Glowing Cigar  over the Lake Pleasant ranges. Driving north on I17 close to Carefree Highway when I noticed this light to the NW. It seemed to be just North of the Lake Pleasant area. At first I assumed it to be the contrails of an airliner descending South into the valley. After observing the light for several minutes , I noticed that the light wasn't moving, it was quite stationary in the sky. There was also no evidence of a willowy or feathered edge, nor a trail to this light that is so characteristic of contrails. The light's shape was that of an elongated cigar whose ends seemed to be positioned N/S.  The color of this object was mainly illuminated white, with a mixture of yellow & blue throughout its corona. I cant give accurate dimensions because I do not have anything to reference it to.  But as far as scale goes, it was 3 inches long by an 1/8 inch in height. It seemed to be over the NE edge of the range that holds Lake Pleasant, so maybe 25 miles away? There were other planes in the sky, local traffic for Deer Valley Airport, as well as the usual Sky Harbor traffic.  None of these planes, regardless of altitude, had contrails. The entire duration of the sighting was less than 10 minutes before it disappeared from a clear sky.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Daylight sighting of a long cigar shaped object that  slowly disappears;2009-07-13 13:00:00;50 seconds;Daylight sighting of a long cigar shaped object that  slowly disappears The object was long and thin, cigar shaped whitish/silver color although more white.  This is a rough guess but I would say it's height was somewhere between 2000 and 5000 feet.  I first thought it must be a plane as we are in the flight path of a major airport.  Started looking for wings, couldn't see any but that's not really unusual because sometimes the angle of the plane makes it impossible to see the wings.  Then I realized that the plane or object was in the wrong place for the flight pattern - too high for just taking off or landing, and too low for passing through. No contrail at all.  As I watched the object, which was flying east to west at about 65 degrees above the horizon, it appeared to just simply fade out. I was looking right at it (still looking for the wings on the thing don't ya know) as it slowly dissappeared! The effect was like a plane going behind clouds that are thin at the edges but get thicker towards the middle - I'd say about 8 to 10 seconds from the time it started to fade, to completely gone. But there were no clouds in the sky. I don't know if my eyes were playing tricks, but at the last place I saw the object - the spot where it completely vanished - there appeared a faint dark smudge - like smoke - in an otherwise clear blue sky. It dissapated in a few seconds, making me wonder if I had actually seen the smudge. I continued scanning the sky but saw nothing more.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

When I had arrived home I had seen it again and I called my mother out to see what I had seen.   My four siblings had gone outside to see it and a friend of my mother had come to the house to see it also.   This unidentified flying object would disappear and then it will reapper.  It would also sway back and forth while the colors were flashing blue and purple. Lastly the shape of this sighting seemed to look like a cigar.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Observations interrupted by strange couple;2014-04-15 17:00:00;10 min;Observations interrupted by strange couple I was in my house when I had a sudden urge to go outside to the front yard. Looking to the East, I saw 3 cigar shaped objects flying in close formation across the sky. They were flying too low, and too slow to be aircraft. I also noticed that their flight did not appear to be smooth as an aircraft would fly.  It was as if they were appearing in the next spot on the sky.  As I watched a younger couple approached me and asked if I was missing a dog, I pointed to the objects and asked if they saw it too, which the female replied, Oh, that's nothing.   I looked at the couple and was struck by their odd appearance, which was too normal.  The male appeared to be Eurasian, and the female was caucasian, yet they were dressed in fancy Southwestern clothes that appeared crisp and new.It was as if someone who was unfamiliar with the area was trying to appear local.  I continued to watch the crafts until they disappeared behind the mountain, when I looked down the couple was gone. They had been on foot, and I had a clear view in both directions, but they were nowhere to be seen,and there was no dog.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Red and yellow, stayed there for 1 whole hour.;2017-04-13 00:00:00;1 hour;red and yellow, stayed there for 1 whole hour. My story is very thrilling.  My family and i were BBQ in our backyard.  We took our seats around our fire pit and started to eat our food.  One of us saw a light in the sky.  He said, ''Guys!  Did you see that?''  We said, ''no, what did you see?'' he said ''it was a light, i don't it was a shooting star it didn't leave a streak. but not only that....it was red and yellow.  We stared like it was pulling our leg.  suddenly we all saw the red and yellow craft which was a cigar shape.  After about 1 it went away.  The whole time the crafts were just sitting there and it almost seemed like they were spectating us.  We all went to bed thinking it was just military aircrafts. but here is where it gets interesting....one us (which was a teen girl) said she woke up and heard a rumbling sound in our backyard...she said that she looked out the window and stunned to see little eyes staring at her (directly at her).  she also said that that she saw an aircraft but it was very small.  It was only about 10 by 4 craft.  She ran to her bed and went under her covers and stayed there in till dawn.  She didn't sleep at all that night and said in the morning what she saw.  we went outside and we were shocked to see a lining of a large circle in the dirt.  In till then we all think it was maybe a UFO.  so that is why we came to you guys.   Please email me back as soon as you guys can, so i can and my family figure this mystery out.  There is much more details to tell.  And when you email me back, please tell me if there has been any similar sightings as what i saw.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
