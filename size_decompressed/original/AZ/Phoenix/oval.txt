Several incandescent football-shaped craft appeared and manuevered in ways unlike any Earthly craft.;1993-06-01 00:00:00;1 minute;Several incandescent football-shaped craft appeared and manuevered in ways unlike any Earthly craft. UFO Report  Dear Sir  I was just made aware of your reporting center from a television show narrated by Peter Jennings.   I appreciate your work.  I’m sending you an ancient sighting report for one purpose:  You may be able to compare the description I give with similar ones, or it may stand out as a different one.  The event happened in approximately 1993 or 1994 in the summer.  My son, his girlfriend and myself were in the back yard of my house when the girlfriend said “Look at that” and pointed to a plastic shopping bag that had been kicked up by a gust of wind.  When I looked at the shopping bag my gaze was directed elsewhere and I saw 4 or 5 craft that I consider to be not only unidentified flying objects but non-Earthly flying craft.  The craft were gold in color and incandescent, glowing with their own light in the full sun, with no part of the craft shadowed.  The craft had no windows, flight controls or other appurtenances.  They were identical, about the size of a thumbnail on an outstretched hand, and were shaped very similar to a football with one exception:  The points of a football are centered between top and bottom, but in these craft the points were slightly lower than the center.  The craft maneuvered independently.  I’m not sure of their number because they maneuvered in diverse directions and moved so fast I couldn’t get a count of them.  I watched one in particular and observed it to move very fast, and to make sudden changes in direction, performance unlike any Earthly craft.  All of the craft were located to the south-southwest of my position.  The one I watched most intently moved to just about due west of me and then changed direction suddenly and went back to the south.  All manuevers observed occurred in clear sky with no other background.  The observation lasted only a minute or so.  Eventually all craft disappeared in one way or another.  The one I watched the most carefully went into or behind a cloud.   At that point I queried my other observers and they agreed, yes, they had seen them too.  The area of my observation is a few miles west of the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.  No Earthly craft would likely be in that area without the knowledge and permission of the Phoenix TRACON.  Seconds after my sighting terminated an airliner departed westbound out of Sky Harbor and climbed directly through the same place in the sky that I had seen these gold-colored craft maneuvering.  The airliner made it all the more apparent by it’s difference that the craft I had been observing were not Earthly craft.  The airliner was larger than the craft, moved very much more slowly, and displayed clear areas of sunlit and shadowed areas on the top and bottom of the fuselage.  I had a 20-year career as a Police Officer, was so employed at the time, and consider myself observant and objectively so.  If you’ve had other reports giving the same description, one that I find to be rare among my casual UFO reading, I’d be interested in knowing about them.

Oval plastic looking craft, translucent, reflective, with numerous projections from the bottom.;1998-05-29 05:00:00;3 hours;Oval plastic looking craft, translucent, reflective, with numerous projections from the bottom. Object was seen before sunup.  Surface was reflective and brightness was greater than Venus during full phase.  Object is an ovoid and appears much like a hot air balloon.  However, it has not moved in over two hours, a balloon normally moves with air currents.  Air currents during Phoenix mornings are east to west.  The object's composition resembles polyethelyne plastic, but the entire object appears to be of the same composition.  Three legs can be seen from the bottom of the object and a large cylindrical section hanging from the bottom.  This thing appears to be a balloon of some sort but it is the strangest balloon I have ever seen.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

This repeated the exact same routine, in the exact same place at least 10 times in the span of an hour Earlier in the night I saw 3 balls of golden light in a triangle formation, and just hovered there. Then standing outside the back of my work I saw this oval type ball of different colored light floating in the air. You could see it pulsating. I stood there and watched it for at least 10 minutes, and then it faded away to the size and brightness of a faint star, and it seemed to glide away slowly. I waited there for 5 minuites and saw the same exact pattern in the same exact place occur at least 9 times after that. Then it just stopped and I haven't seen anything since.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

I was out walking our dog, when glacing up at the sky I noticed a large glowing white object in the southern sky, at about a 45 degree angle from the horizon.  It was traveling West to East, consistently at a slow speed.  The size was about 1/4 the size of a full moon. It's shape is best described as oval.

possible sighting in Phoenix;2004-04-18 18:30:00;10 min;possible sighting in Phoenix I live in North Phoenix.  Looking north I noticed a single point of light it was steady and did not move at all.  I fixed the light in refrence to the edge of my portch to see if it might be moving.  As I watched a commercial jet flew under the object.  We have what I would term an approach pattern somewhat over our home for Sky Harbor Airport however SHA is 20 miles south of us so the jets are usually fairly high.  The object was much higher which made me think it may be a planet or star being illuminated by the setting sun.  To my surprise it vanished as I was watching it.  It didnt move the whole time but it seemed to have a brownish haze around it then just seemed to fade away.  The fact the it didnt move was what drew my attention to it in the first place, and watching it fade rose the hair on the back of my neck!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

He said this did not happen often but when it did, there was always a ufo in the area.  He said the molecules started to move faster then he told me to look up in the sky.  There was a craft, oval shaped (boomerrange) with rounded ends, he said it was partially cloked.  it was traveling north approx. 300 mph and approx. 1 mile high. he thinks it was a mining vessel. an airliner flew in the vicinity and you could tell the difference.  as i tracked the craft through the sky i began to also see molecules moving in the air.  the craft looked like a puffy white cloud,like other clouds in the sky that day, but obviosly was not.  you could tell by the way it was traveling it was not a cloud. then it blended into the sky.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Maybe saucer or oval shape too far away to see the exact shape. Occured at 1:18 AM on August 7, 2004. The oval shape light disappeared in about on minute. Moved around just a little bit staying in the same area. There were several clouds in the sky but none were in the way. Way to bright to be a airplane or helicoptor.

In fact, that is what I th;2005-04-10 13:30:00;45 sec;I saw an object that looked much like one of those silver baloons filled with helium sold in grocery stores. In fact, that is what I thought I was seeing, except for  two noteable differences. The bottom third seemed to be transparent and at the very bottom a white light as bright as the sun. The object could have been anywhere from a hundred yards to a mile or more away from me, I had no frame of reference to judge its distance. It moved slowly north to south seeming to slow a bit as a ballon drifting in the wind might. Its altitude seemed constant. It appeared at least five hundred feet above the floor of a valley I was facing.  After watching it in surprise, I ran to get a camera and was back in about twenty seconds by which time the object was gone. At the speed it was moving while I was watching, this should not have been possible. This was a clear day, the sun overhead and no noticable wind at my location. I have a picture of where I saw it, but not of the object itself. The size was about the end of my thumb at arm's length. There was no sound and it was so quiet that I could hear rocks scrunching under the wheels of a Jeep about a quarter mile away. So I didn't seen it arrive, I think it was there when I starting looking that way, and I didn't see it leave, it was gone when I got back with my camera.  I would say it was a baloon except for the transparent part at the bottom and the very bright white light at the very bottom. Also, if it were a balloon, how did it disappear so quickly? Even if it burst, it should have been visible falling and I did look for that. It's really too bad I couldn't have gotten a pic of it. So there you have it, worthless as a report like this probably it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

We were outside and heard a noise. we looked up and saw an oval shaped craft with blinking red lights.  We watched for a longer  time and it had green and blue blinking lights too.  It was hovering closely to the backyard and started to go away very quickly and hovered in different circular patterns.  After a while we saw another one of the same things a little bit farther away.  They seemed to be circling the moon but we don't know for sure.  every time we tried to take a picture it wouldn't work as if there was a force-field interference.  Even with a telescope, everytime we looked it seemed to disappear.  After about a half hour of hovering around the moon, it shot out a bright, white light beam on the earth.  We thought it could be a helicopter doing a search so we turned on the news but saw nothing.  If it really was the news or cops they should have reported it so we thought for sure it was a  UFO!  We know what we saw tonight and hope you believe us!!!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

At first I thought that it was a blimp or a balloon, but we didn't seem to gain on the object.  The object stayed at a constant altitude, but seemed to dip up and down on occasion.  When we drove on to SR-85, we watched this thing which started to move further from us, but moving southwest.  We finally lost the object behind some mountains.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

white object floating in sky deploys hoses which spray out clouds, they joins another cloud and flys away;2011-08-27 18:15:00;25 minutes;white object floating in sky deploys hoses which spray out clouds, they joins another cloud and flys away I was in my bedroom talking to my girlfriend at 6:15 pm on a breezy, partly cloudy evening.  Clouds were mostly Cumulus, with a few Stratus cruising across the sky West to East.  The wind was Westerly at 12-15 mph (I am a windsurfer and constantly watch clouds and weather). My girlfriend asked if I could see the odd striated patterns in the sky that looked like clouds.  I could not see them.  Typically, she is very sensitive to everything, and sees and feels things I can't.  I replied I can't see but noticed I have an odd pressure in my right ear.  She said she had it too, only her whole head. I spotted a white balloon above the palm tree next door to the North.  It looked fairly far away and about 5-7mm across (in thumb and forefinger held up pinching it).  It was lit brilliantly by the sun dropping on the horizon.  It did not move in the wind.  I thought maybe the wind was calm at that elevation.  I asked if she saw it.  She did.  I pointed out that it wasn't moving with the wind.She agreed.  I went and got my Brunton Binoculars, and her Sunset Binoculars. With them I could easily see the string hanging from the white balloon.  She could see it with her's too.  How could the string be visible from this distance?  It would have to be a thick rope which a balloon could never lift.  Then we noticed the string looked kinked. It hung in a slight zig zag pattern under the balloon.  It also hung a bit to the East, like it was being blown by the wind to the East. We went outside to get a better look. The clouds and balloon began to have a orange-reddish hue on their western edges due to the sun getting low on the western horizon.  The balloon appeared to rotate 90 degrees showing a side-view which made it look like a piece of white rice.  Now the string was  not hanging but extending West-sideways-from the West end of the rice  And then another kinked string extending East from the East end of the rice.  The pressure in my ear had increased.  The 2 strings became 6, 3 on each end originating from the 2 points where the 2 strings had come out of.  All 6 were kinked just as the hanging string had originally appeared.  Then tiny-at-first white spots appeared at the outboard ends of the kinky strings.  As the 6 white spots grew they started to look like 6 little puffy Cumulus Clouds.  Then they grew together into 2 bigger clouds, one on the East, one on the West. My girlfriend and I were discussing this the whole time, she saw exactly what I saw. As the 2 clouds grew they engulfed the rice (or Tic Tac as I've seen recent descriptions), hiding the rice completely.  It was then I notice a cloud Northwest of the rice cloud, which also wasn't moving with the wind.  This cloud suddenly cruised Southeast to the rice cloud and engulfed it.  The now-1-cloud rapidly flew  away straight North and disappeared over the horizon within 5 or 10 seconds. Summary:  The original round appearance only let me see one of the hoses which had been deployed to squirt out the cloud-material.  When it rotated sideways I could see there were hoses on each end which spread apart into 3 on each side.  The kinked points were the hinges by which the hoses were folded inside the object.  As the clouds were emitted the object appeared to deflate some looking less full...of cloud stuff.  Why didn't it blow with the wind?  Where did the other, much bigger cloud come from, and why didn't it blow with the wind? Once the rice was totally covered the bigger cloud went across the wind to meet up with it before exiting North.  At night I see planes flying south.  It takes 5 minutes for them to cover the distance the cloud did in seconds. I went inside and immediately wrote this description down.  At some point our ear and head pressures had gone away.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Noticed a bright orange somewhat flickering fire colored light coming from south to north;2014-04-18 23:05:00;4 minutes;Noticed a bright orange somewhat flickering fire colored light coming from south to north At approx.  11:05pm, on April 18, 2014, I was in my backyard, noticed a bright orange somewhat flickering light coming from south to north in the Sky Harbor Airport area in central Phoenix, kind of looked like a small flickering fire, coming somewhat in my direction it started to turn to the west like a normal jet plane would.  As it turned I was looking for a strobe light like on a plane, there was nothing no noise either, then as it turned to the west holding its altitude of maybe 3-4 thousand feet,  the flickering fire looking light turned to a more solid appearing orange-yellow light.  I ran into the house to get my binoculars as quick as I could. As I came out the the object was farther away still going west, then it appeared to just nose dive and went out of site, a few seconds later I saw a second orange flickering light object farther away to the southwest towards downtown phoenix flying level for a few seconds and it too nose dived out of sight. The third object came  approx. 20 seconds later with the same flight path as the first one.  And  again where the first one turned, this one did as well at the same altitude.  This time having the binoculars I started to look for it.   As it turned away, I saw it, either it was oval  or round  being in a banking turn and out the back end of it where several maybe 6-8 equally spaced bright solid yellowish lights where the back end of it would be.  I had a good eyeball on it as it turned, then all of a sudden those lights I was looking at out the back of it went dark, yet I was still panning on a dark object in the sky afterwards for a few seconds more.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

It started to head east, then flipped around completely and quick and headed west.  It was truly amazing.  We couldn't watch it any longer as it went behind buildings and such.

3 separate sightings of bright orange objects in the sky over Phoenix;2014-09-29 21:50:00;3-4 minutes;3 separate sightings of bright orange objects in the sky over Phoenix Possible UFO Sighting  Date of incident: 9/29/14 Time: starting approx. 2150 – 2155 hours Duration: approx. 15-20 seconds Number of objects: 3 ( 3 separate sightings spaced approx. 30 – 45 seconds apart) Location: North Phoenix/Glendale area, Maricopa County, Arizona Direction of travel:  Objects traveled from the Northwest to the Southeast Color and shape: Bright orange, round in color  Summary On 9/29/14 at approx. 2050 hours I was sitting outside on my back patio when I observed a bright orange round object moving slowly across the sky traveling at a slow rate of speed coming from the Northwest and went towards the Southeast.  I observed it for approx. 15 – 20 seconds.  The orange object was not flickering or flashing but the all of a sudden the light went out and I could still see a dark image for a brief moment  and then it disappeared. Approx. 30 -45 seconds later I observed a second object with the same description as the first traveling the same trajectory.. Then the orange light went out about 15 – 20 seconds later and  I could not see the object afterwards. I then ran into the house and got my cell phone camera. Again, approx. 15  seconds later I observed a 3rd object, same as the first two traveling the same course and manner. I recorded this object on my cell phone and again the light went out and again I could see the object briefly but I could not see the shape or where it disappeared to. The weather was clear and the temperature was approx. 70 -75 degrees at the time. I did not see any aircraft in the area. It should be noted that Luke AFB is located approx. 20 miles to the southwest of my location and the F-16’s usually do night training from about 2100 – 2230 hours and you could see and hear them but there were no military aircraft at the time of my observations. On the video I gave the description as possibly as flares but none of the three objects flickered or left a smoke trail. As of this writing I have not seen anything on the news or the web.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

When I zoomed in on picture to take a closer look it appears to have an Aurora around it and no trail of light behind the object.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Oval shaped disk w/15 degree increase towards center top bright light w/thin beams extended to its side shot up & disappeared.;2016-06-27 17:50:00;30+ seconds;Oval shaped disk w/15 degree increase towards center top bright light w/thin beams extended to its side shot up & disappeared. This citing occurred on Monday, June 27, 2016 at 5:50 P.M. in Phoenix, Arizona. I was driving home going west on Bell Road, past the 51 Freeway by a few minutes.  I stopped for a red light.  There were monsoon clouds in the distance, but something closer caught my eye as I was waiting.  This cloud was unusually bright--white.  I looked at it and realized that it wasn't a cloud--it was too small in the foreground, very white/illuminated, and had a very distinctive (not blurry around the ends like a cloud) shape.  The light was shaped like a skinny oval.  From the top, the oval wasn't flat but graduated up towards the center about 15 degrees.  Suddenly, from each end a beam of a similar bright light (thin like a string) shot out at the same time then this shape shot straight up and was gone.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Shortly after the light changes, the object shot up in an upward motion incredibly fast and disappeared.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Found odd object on Google Earth;2019-04-15 12:00:00;unknown;Found odd object on Google Earth 12.11.2020  Subject: Odd object found on Google Earth Street view.  To Whom It May Concern:  I am sending this information on to you so you can have a look see to come up with your own conclusion.  I’m not saying it is a UFO.  I am just saying it doesn’t look like a bird, plane or balloon etc.  Below is a bullet point list of how to view on Google Earth and other notes or observations I may have.  I hope you find it interesting.  •	If in Google Earth (GE), type in this address to fly you there.  It is not my address or anyone I know.  It is just what GE lists as a location when in street view. &#61607	1615 E. Cielo Grande Ave &#61607	Phoenix, AZ •	Or if in GE, these are their GPS coordinates to get you to the same area: &#61607	33 degrees 41’42.56”  & 112 degrees 02’51.63” •	As you can see, the round ball in the picture with the silvery top and what looks like to be a darkened shadow below. •	I realize that in GE Street View, things can become distorted.  That is why I am not claiming it is a true UFO. •	When GE takes you to this location, click to Street View Icon and try to go down to the very end of the dead end street to get the right view.  Reason being, is when I tried going back to this spot later, for some reason GE did not show that view and I had to play around with it to get it back up. Hopefully, you will not have that issue. •	When in Street View, for some reason when you click to go back and forth down the street, it sometimes gives you a view that does not show the object.  I am not sure if it is a left over picture from a previous Street View series or what.  But what I do look for is the bird that is sitting on top of the street lamp post as the indicator. •	Deer Valley Airport, which is a smaller airport is to the West. •	In testing my idea by going back out the street to find a plane flying in, you can definitely tell that it is a plane coming in to land at the airport.  But what I am looking at seems like a round ball which to me is definitely not a plane.  Thanks, and hopefully you may have an answer for this.  Sincerely,  Phoenix Arizona Resident.  I will also send an email to the address you list below with the pictures of what I am speaking about.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

A bullet shaped craft was traveling from east to west with a blue/purple contrails coming off the top and bottom of it.  I traveled at a fast and steady speed for about 5-10 seconds, then it just disappeared. About 10 seconds later a helicopter came from the east flying west as if in pursuit but was way to slow. My friend pulled up as i was standing outside and the saw the exact same thing . Then 5 minutes later another friend showed up saying they were about 2 miles away saying the same thing. I briefly caught a glimpse of it on my security cameras digital video recorder.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
