Phoenix, Summer of 85  Sighting in apartment complex;1985-06-01 20:00:00;??????;Phoenix, Summer of 85  Sighting in apartment complex I believe that is was the summer of 85.  My mom and I took a trip out to Phoenix to pick up our dogs from her boyfriend at the time.  I was outside playing in the apartment complex with a bunch of other kids.  This craft of some sort came out from behind the left side of the apartment building.  It was hovering low but it made no sound.  It moved super slow and seemed to be there forever.  Long enough for all of us kids to go get our parents and they were standing out there looking at it too.  I don’t remember if I walked closer to look at it but it seemed to me that if I had stood on the block wall that circled that apartment complex I could have touched it.  I think it had lights that went around the edge of it.  I don’t remember what shape it was just that it was dark and like nothing I had ever seen before.  I don’t remember feeling afraid or in danger.  I can’t even remember it going away or if it was there so long that I lost interest. I remember everyone who was standing in the driveway looking at it was very calm, very quiet and I don’t remember ever discussing it with anyone until recently.  My mom even remembers it.  I would love to know if anyone in Phoenix at that time saw that same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Lights seen in Phoenix, AZ back in the late 1980's.;1988-06-30 01:00:00;5-60 minutes;Lights seen in Phoenix, AZ back in the late 1980's. Only Lights  Story 1:  In the late 1980's I worked at a banking processing center here in Phoenix, AZ, (Bell Road and the I-17), on the night shift.  It was common for us to finish our work midnight or later, then hang around in the parking lot for some time chatting afterwards.  Due to the type of work we were doing, it was only breaks and non-work time that would provide us a chance to talk. One night, after mid-night, we must have stood around talking for nearly 45-60 minutes.  The entire time it looked as if there was a light cloud cover over head and behind the clouds were single lights that slowly came on and then faded off.  It seemed to cover the whole sky directly over head and had been going on when we got out there and continued on when we all left. We all saw it.  Commented on it.  Wondered what it was. But never once...at least not until the next day... did any of us think of it in terms of &quotUFO's&quot.  Then of course, it was a done deal and no one knew what else to do with the information. Story 2: I worked at this site for about 11 years.   Every night at break, 8-8:30PM, I would walk the perimeter of the business park, since we did a lot of sitting for the job.  Another night...and I wish I could remember how much later it was, as it could have been months or years...I just don't know.... I was out walking and looked to the western sky, it must have been close to summer as the sky was still a little lit up. What I saw was similar to the earlier light(s), except the was only one cloud in the sky and as I watched it, it looked to have a light behind it.  Like someone was holding a giant flashlight behind a cloud. The odder part was, as I watched, the cloud began to shrink and the light faded with it until the sky was clear of any cloud, or light in about 5 minutes or less. There was a co-worker, who was off that night, who I mentioned this to the next day when we were together.  She had been out walking with her husband and said she saw the same thing around the same time...however, she saw it in the northwestern sky, not the western sky,  like I had.  And she lived further north of where we worked. Neither of us had any of the classic symptoms, like lost time or lost memory.  Never saw any craft or movements, other than the fading on and off of the lights both times.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen anything like that since.  Yet, I have heard of folks who say they see lights over the White Tank Mountains to the west of the valley all the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Apparent UFO crash into our airspace.;1988-09-01 17:00:00;2 minutes;Apparent UFO crash into our airspace. In Sept of 1988, I was traveling East on Broadway in Mesa on my way to work, when I looked up almost ESE at about a 45 degree angle.  It was round in shape and I figured it just entered our airspace because apparently with the speed at which it must have been traveling it broke up and was gone.  The whole thing lasted about one minute.  I don't remember seeing any fire from it, just the breaking up.  I listened for the news to report something about it, but never heard a word!  Nothing about it or anything else crashing or breaking up. Something else happened here in Seguin, Tx,  about two years ago, but I'd rather not report it.  It's too crazy to report.  It sounds more like a made up story. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
The Phoenix Lights Incident: Was anyone Abducted like I was On March 13, 1997?;1997-03-13 20:00:00;4 hours;The Phoenix Lights Incident: Was anyone Abducted like I was On March 13, 1997? Was anyone abducted during the Phoenix Lights Incident?  Because I'm pretty sure I was.   The time was around 7:50 to 8:40 when suddenly my 2 children came running into the Kitchen and said mommy theirs no more stars in the sky!  So I went to see.  And they were right the stars were gone something replaced the stars with what I could describe as perfectly squared knots and bolts connected to rods, like standing underneath a perfectly well made car covered the entire sky.  It was a duel black color and there was no lights and it didn't move it just sat there.  So I started to run down to the corner to see how far this thing went when I stopped short thinking, What the hell?  when a voice that sounded like myself or my mothers voice say, Oh gone its just us, its no big deal go on and see how far this thing goes  So I went to see because I felt it was no big deal. And this thing reached from where I was standing at 7th Ave passed Camelback Mountain!!  {Also we lived on a busy street and theirs was no cars, no people, and absolutely no noise. I mean no sound anywhere.  I can't explain it but its as if time stopped.}  Any way, this thing was huge and I yelled to my children who were strangely standing all the way by the door I said, Wow!  This thing reaches all the way to camelback mountain wow! And my oldest daughter at the time was 11 years old said, Well I'm going in the house as if she was frightened and that's not like her to act like that at all.  At that moment that's when I realized I was standing under a Huge Mothership!  So I didn't look up because I didn't want them who were in the Ship to know that I knew it was a Mothership.  So I attempted to make a run for the door when everything suddenly went Black.  I completely Blacked out and cannot remember how the hell I got in the house.  In fact my children and I couldn't remember that entire incident until 13 years later.  So I'd really like to know was an! yone else abducted or did anyone black out like I did?  Because! this incident has been bothering me since I could remembered the incident in 2010.  And I'd really like to know if anyone was abducted, if so what happen to them?  Thank you very much for your time.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the possibility of twinkling stars.  Just a guess.  PD))  Stationary red-green=white lights.;1997-06-01 01:00:00;4 hrs;Stationary red-green=white lights. For several years I have debated on whether to reoport this or not.   I was working a grave yard shift which required me to be out-side for different lengths.   I noticed a stationary red-green-white light to the northwest.  It was of indeterminate altitude but having seen weather baloons I had the impression that it was at least 100,00 - 150,000 feet in altitude.   I looked to the east of it's position and saw the second, a third was southeast of the second, the 4th - 6th were south and east and coming back to the southwest.   The lights were clusted in a group of red-gree-white and appeared to be touching.   There is a large hill to the south and particularly west of where I was and was unable to tell if there were any more.  My impression was they were equidistant from each other and in a circle around Phoenix.   They remained stationary for 4 - 5 hours and when I was releived at 6 a.m. were gone/not visible due to the sun shine.   They were not there the next night.  I mentioned them to a co-worker and also to my wife.   A few nights later there was a  news report from North Carolina?  with vidio. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the possibility of twinkling stars.

An object flys from North to South, makes turn into space.;1999-07-01 06:00:00;.5 min;An object flys from North to South, makes turn into space. I was walking the dogs just prior to daybreak and while they go about their business, I usually look at the morning sky. I saw, what I thought at first was a shooting star, approaching from the north. It continued south and just stopped. It stayed there for about 5 seconds, long enough for me to continue to focus on it, and made a sharp 90 degree, (left), turn into space. It was so far out that I could not make out a shape, color, etc. Being a veteran from the U.S. Air Force and knowing what speeds our military and commercial aircraft are capable of doing, I know for a fact that it wasn't ours. I can also guess that the speed of this object was between 2000-5000 MPH just by visual vectoring alone. I'm sorry I don't have the exact date, time, but I never knew this web site existed. You may contact me if you wish by e-mail. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Phoenix Az,  6-8 lights 2-25-02  21:30, Lights seemed to make up larger craft;2002-02-25 21:30:00;7 min;Phoenix Az,  6-8 lights 2-25-02  21:30, Lights seemed to make up larger craft On Monday Feb 25th 2002 9:35 pm Phoenix AZ. I was out in my backyard when about 6-8 white lights suddenly appeared. They were all in a line and seemed to float in the air for a few min. before they started to move North to South. The sky was clear and there was very little wind and there was no sound of jets, helicopters, and prop planes. I had enough time after watching them float to run inside and yell to my wife to come down and see them. She was really excited and we both watched them increase in speed and move out of sight. We also both made an observation that kind startled us both. As the lights moved away from us they seem to make up the outline of a much larger ship. When they were above me I only saw the lights with clear sky in back of them, not the outline of a ship. But again as it moved away it looked, as those lights were again the outline of a larger ship. I have read in the past about a sighting here in Phoenix of the Arizona Lights, but these lights were bright white and blinked in a pattern that was sometimes random and sometimes one right after the other. Did anyone get a better look?? Has anyone see anything like this. Thanks;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Strobing blue light, LONG BRIGHT white tail, dropping  midair bombs and released a single orange sphere.;2003-03-14 20:20:00;10 MINUTES;Strobing blue light, LONG BRIGHT white tail, dropping  midair bombs and released a single orange sphere. Currently on vacation for a month in Arizona, but reside in the Chicago-land area, I was watching the show fastlane on fox, phoenix time, when i looked out the window and noticed a blueish-white strobe light type phenomenon going on in the sky out of the corner of my eye, which appeared to be about 15-20 miles away, with out a sound the phenomenon turned spectacular and unimagineable, and erupted a glowing white streak of sparks behind it, going straight down out of the sky. I raced to the window to get a closer look and it stopped. I sat back down to continue watching the tv, again out of the corner of my eye the same strobing light released an orange sphere of light which resembled the so called flare of the massive ufo sighting that occured in Phoenix's past, which disappeared behind the initial blue strobing light i was seeing after about 5 seconds, Followed by more white streaking spark-like in the sky, about a 1000 foot tail id imagine. After doing various maneuvers, S shapes, and dive's,  which were highlighted by the white spark streak, the ufo which i was seeing dropped several midair-bombs which resembled a high altitude fireworks mortar explosion, the colors of the sparks comming off the explosions, 2 different colors, one was solid purple, and one was solid green. The purest of these two colors i have ever seen. I was in complete awe, when i then raced to get the attention of my brothers girlfriends mom. She was also fascinated by the encounter. The site was so spectacular, and visible, there had to have been atleast 1000 people witness on the road driving west at the time, that had to have seen this. It was in the Northwestern sky , please if there is anyone out there who also witnessed this even please post a report. There is an airforce base close around phoenix, during this day, I also witnessed a jet training. 4 Jets flying in a cross pattern formation giving off an exhaust they had control over, releasing it when they went straight up, or straght down doing maneuvers. I heard no sounds during the ufo encounter, but i definatley heard the roar of the fighter jets during the day, thats how I differentiated the phenmomena i saw, from the training exercises, although the training could have been for a different unknown craft that I witnessed.

i was flying near pheonix when a craft flew right in front of my airplane for 16 min;2003-08-25 21:45:00;16min;i was flying near pheonix when a craft flew right in front of my airplane for 16 min On Aug 25th at 9:45pm I was flying from Gila Bend Airport to Deer Valley Airport when I saw a shape and movement that should'nt be in the sky.  I have been flying for 4 years and have never saw anything like this.  It was a very clear calm night, the surrounding area was very dark, except for Phoenix in the background. I was at 5500 ft above the ground, cruising at 145 knots.   I had just taken off from Gila Bend, when from out of nowhere a somewhat big craft of some kind flew right in front of me, approx 50 yards.  I  instantly turned to my left and reported it to ATC, who told me they had nothing on their radar.  For the few seconds I was directly behind it, I should have been in some kind of turbulence, but instead the flight got even smoother.  I also noticed my ADF CDI started malfunctioning, the needle started pointing directly at it.  The craft flew along my right wing occasionaly increasing speed dramatically to possibly 300 knots, and changing its altitude.  It appeared to be getting closer to me at one point, and instead of backing away like I should have, I kept my current course.    It must have been about 100 ft away, and I noticed what I thought was the front. I saw no lights on it, the only reason I could see it at all was because of the glow of Phoenix in the background 40 miles away. after exactly 16 min and watching it pretty closely it made a sudden move farther from my course and a rappid increase in speed and a slight climb and it was gone.  I contacted Phoenix Sky Harbour, and told them what I saw and that it appeared to be entering their airspace. They also told me they had nothing on radar.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Incredible light show in South Phoenix;2004-06-14 20:35:00;10 Minutes;Incredible light show in South Phoenix I am a security officer assigned in the North Phoenix area. As my partner and I were waiting for the last of the employees to depart the facility, we noticed five amber lights in the South West Phoenix(?) area. I question whether or not they were in Phoenix due to the distance. As we were watching these five amber lights, four side by side and the fifth just slightly removed to the West, another seven or eight appeared to the East of the original five. The first five remained for five minutes and went out. The second group waited another five minutes and proceeded to do the same. As we were watching this incredible light show, we also noticed that there was not a single aircraft in the Southern sky! Even the air corridor from the South West was clear. For the rest of the evening we observed one or two amber lights popping up in different locations. The last sighting was at approximatly 22:30 hrs.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Nighttime lights moving over the Northwestern Valley of Phoenix.;2005-09-06 22:04:00;>5 minutes;Nighttime lights moving over the Northwestern Valley of Phoenix. I have watched the night sky for many years, and feel compelled to report this one. Noticed 2 distinct orange/red lights in the SSW sky for around a minute. I went inside for no more than 30 seconds to retrieve my camcorder. Came out to my back patio and began filming object(s). After a minute or so, a third light appeared, and then a forth. Then the object drifted beyond the mountain range. less than a minute later, the four lights reappeared over the range in approximately the same area of space. The lights were all the same color. Of the four lights, each one would disappear for a couple of seconds, in no particular order. The lights then seemed to head off towards the SSW and fell behind the range. I then took several side steps to my left and was able to see these lights again. The number of lights visible with the naked eye was more accurrate than using the zoom on my recorder. At times my camera would pick up more than two lights, but for several minutes, the naked eye was better. For instance, I would see four lights-or three with my eyes, but my camera would pick up Two. The lights would again blink in and out for several seconds at a time until they left my field of view. I noticed 2 commercial vehicles in the air. One was coming from the north, possible to PHX. another was broadly circling towards the west.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

The event lasted about 10 seconds!  It was was about 45 degrees high, due east and for about 3 or 4 seconds it was slowly moving north, it picked up speed pretty fast an it was also dimming rather fast as well.   It had just went into a thin stretch of clouds and I waited for it to reappear on thr other side but it never did.  Even a plane coming head on would not have the brightness that the object had and I stood outside an extra 5 minutes just to see if it ever cleared the clouds, it never did, it just vanished!

Red and Greenish/White lights making a zigzag motion, then disappearing over the horizon;2008-08-05 23:32:00;2 Minutes;Red and Greenish/White lights making a zigzag motion, then disappearing over the horizon I was walking my dog in the Roosevelt District of Phoenix, and I noticed what appeared to be red lights that had a strange greenish/white hue.  Not knowing how lights could have more than one color I stopped and stared, and noticed that the craft was making a zigzag motion across the sky. I watched it for a minute or so, then suddenly it turned around and accelerated over the horizon in about 2-3 seconds.  At that point I knew it had to have been a UFO because nothing can move that fast.  I looked at my watch as it disappeared and it was exactly 11:32PM. One interesting characteristic about this is that when I saw the lights, there  seemed to be an aura or hue.  It was dark, so I could not clearly see the craft, but it seemed to have a metallic, or mother of pearl look and I could see the shape of the craft was round and appeared to be roughly the size of a dime.  Not knowing how large the craft was, it's hard to say how high up it was, but I estimate it was probably about 2 or 3 miles overhead.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

I saw several small planes appear several minutes after the light passed, however they were moving extremely slow compared to the green lights.  The planes travelled in roughly the same direction as the lights, but not the exact path.  The noise from the planes made it extremely noticeable that the lights had no noise.

Strange craft seen from air plane traveling fast and low over Arizona desert;2008-12-29 11:05:00;1 minute;Strange craft seen from air plane traveling fast and low over Arizona desert I was flying from Portland,Or to Pheonix, AZ roughly 20 minutes before landing i looked out my window and saw a small metalic looking craft going incredibly fast over the desert.  I calculated that our plain was going roughly 500 miles an hour and this thing was going at least as fast as we were. I did my reasearch and this thing was moving faster than any small aircraft can go.  Another intresting fact that should be noted is that it was flying roughly only 100 to 200 feet above the desert mountains.  I watched it for roughly one minute before it disapeared off into the horizon.  I know that this was in no way an aircraft also because i saw other aircraft earlier that were farther away smd they were completely defined, while this craft had no deffenition, no wings and no tail.  My estimation of the shape is a disc shaped object but given its rapid rate of speed it was too hard to tell.   I do not know if anyone else from that flight saw it i had no knowledge of it.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
2 white objects in Phoenix, one changes color to red;2010-03-03 13:35:00;Approx 15 Min;2 white objects in Phoenix, one changes color to red Unfortunately, I was in my car driving at the time and as I result was unable to witness the conclusion of the event. I was traveling east on Bethany Home Rd around 19th Ave.  I was headed to the Christown shopping center area to get drive through Taco Bell (bad for me, I know), when I saw a white object in the eastern sky. The object was bouncing upward and looked like a plastic bag caught in an updraft, which is what I thought it was at first, but then it just stopped and seemed to hover.  I had to make a turn into the parking lot and I lost track of the object.  I parked and got out to try and reacquire it, but no luck. I got back into the car and drove to the drive through.  After I got there and ordered, and another car pulled in behind me so I couldn't back out, I saw the object again.  This time it was closer to being overhead, slightly north and east of my position. I have to take my eye off it to pull forward.  Once I stopped, I look for the object once again.  Now I see 2 objects, the new one further west of the original. I pull forward again.  Now when I look at the objects, the new one has changed color to red. The objects are moving, but so slow I could hardly tell.  The white object seems to be moving closer to the red object.  The white object starts to circle around the red object counter clockwise, all the while closing the distance between them. I have to look away to pay for my food.  I look up very briefly after taking my food and see the white object moving away from the red one.  I sped out of the drive through to a parking space I get out and look for the objects once again.  They are nowhere to be found at this point. I would like to know if anyone else saw this and if anyone knows what these objects were.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Very Large Object.;2010-05-15 19:30:00;45 min;Very Large Object. On May 15 2010 we were on the back patio and observed an object at approximately 7:30 pm in the western skies from our home in Sun City.  The object had multi colored lights not flashing on and off more that they were dimming and getting brighter and possibly looked as if they were rotating around the object.   We also observed many planes being routed over us coming from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport that we do not normally see.  We observed this object for about 45 minutes as it finally moved very slowly towards the west until we lost it on the horizon.  As planes moved towards the object there was a white light that would emanate from the object towards the approaching plane.  This beam of light was wide and was white and very dim not bright.  The object seemed to be shaped to where it had a vertical section to a point and a larger mass at its center where most of the lights were at.  The object was in the direction of Luke AFB from our position.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Saw what appeared to be a contrail, starting midway up the sky with a flat trajectory,  object then made an abrubpt turn and appeared to reverse directions into a cloud bank, then disappeared. I continued to monitor the contrail and it appears as if there was an explosion at the beginning of the contrail as it spread out farther than the balance of the streak. The contrail remnants could be seen for 10 mins after the incident.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
((HOAX??))  A Shadow Ship, A Being, And Unexplained Beams Glassing The Sands In Arizona. Detailed Story's Of A Desert Boy.;2011-07-05 23:11:00;about three minutes;A Shadow Ship, A Being, And Unexplained Beams Glassing The Sands In Arizona. Detailed Story's Of A Desert Boy. I've Reported here before  I never followed up because I was scared.  I think its finally time to talk... I was in my back yard, and my dog was barking like crazy, i was trying to get her to be quiet, she kept running back and fourth in the yard, jumping up the fence, like as if chasing a cat... she was barking and she sat in the middle of the yard. and i finally got up one last time to bring her inside, but as soon as i got next to her she stopped barking. it was so silent. at night, you can see the stars... for the most part... there wasn't any. it was pitch black. i mean, NOTHING. it, the stars i mean, were in the shape of a ellipse, but i don't know for sure. my phone broke, like, literally. broke. the battery was dripping. i don't know what happened next. i woke up in my room and i haven't talked to anyone except for one person. The second encounter i had, which I've sent before, was in my living room. in the morning. the sun was barely rising. it was around 4 or 5, summer. and i looked out the window. and. there it was. clear as day. a being. Its face was like a bony mans, very skinny, sucked in to the bone.  it had no eyes. no nose. it had holes on the sides of its head, which, i thought were like a reptiles ears. but this was pale, flesh. it looked human. but it had the slightest green in it. blue in some spots. it was tall, but hunched over, it had four arms, and very small legs. it had a very large spine, like, it was long, and it was very prominent, very easy to see through its flesh. it had something else, where our ribs would be.  It looked like gills, they were bright pink. no tail.  I dropped my glass of milk and he/it turned to look at me.  It stared. for what felt like hours...  I know exactly what it looks like.  I could almost feel the creature through the glass.  I blacked out.  I woke up lat! er around 12. And lastly. the reason why I reported this entire three story's.  was because i was in page with a friend, hes Navajo , and he took  me to meet his family on the reservation. that first night, we went out at about 12, we got up, on top of this huge sandstone ridge, and he said that his father told him never to leave at night, blah blah blah right? i'm a boy, i'm 14. i didn't listen. mind you i'm a very intelligent 14 year old boy. I should have listened.  There was a bright light.  illuminated the valley. it was a bright as day, it grew brighter and brighter. and then it kind of coned into a small area, like a stage light.  but really bright, we could feel the heat, and it was very cold. anyway, the cone of light grew so small you could barely see it, yet it grew hotter and hotter. it was like a laser. technically, by definition a light is a laser. but whatever.   BACK TO THE STORY.  A loud buzzing sound started, it was a low hum, then a loud ring. then. complete silence but it was! bright, the light sketched across the sand like lighting or a crack in the ice. we ran faster then I've ran before. *living in the ghettos of Arizona, especially being white, you have a lot of things to run from*   We decided to walk back to the sands after last night, and we walked out there, and it was over cast, raining.... but the rain was caught and wouldn't sink more then a few feet inches. we dug in. for a radius of thirty feet, there was glass.  It looked like a spider web on the top, with a plate under it. we dug it up and, it looked random to me, but who knows, the father said to leave it and its gods work, its not for the media, so we buried it. Shortly after the mans cattle and sheep started to disappear. I NEED a follow up please, i really want this to be at least seen by someone. I almost feel like the one person i told doesn't believe me…;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Bright Blue & Red Object in North Valley;2011-12-24 06:50:00;15 minutes;Bright Blue & Red Object in North Valley Looking NNE from 35th Ave and Cholla area.  Sky was dark, pre-dawn. At approximately 6:45am on the morning of 12/24/2011 I was in my backyard smoking a cigarette when I noticed a bright deep blue light in the NNE sky.  As I watched, the light seemed to dance, circling and turning, rising and falling, and changing color from a bright deep blue to a bright vibrant red.  The light appeared to stretch and change shape (elongate) briefly as it changed color and direction. I believe the object to be quite some distance from my location so I was unable to determine the size/shape of the light.  Nor could I hear any sounds emanating from the light. The changes in direction however were precise and deliberate.  From my perspective the light seemed to be traveling very fast and change direction using a VERY tight radius. The light would change color from blue to red and then back to blue. There were NO “blinking” lights associated with this light, and on occasion the light seemed to disappear only to reappear in another similar area but traveling in a different direction.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

While waiting for my turn, I saw 9 orange lights in the distance coming at us from the SE horizon.  It looked like they were all traveling at the same speed.  Thinking that maybe they were planes waiting to land at Sky Harbor, we noticed they were NOT in formation, they were orange and the other moving objects in the sky were planes.  These 9 objects were not planes and appeared as orange lights, shape unknown.   Then suddenly one light just blinked out, then another, and another until they were all gone.  My son was able to capture these lights on his cell phone camera and recorded each light as they went out. I can send it to you, if you want.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Something strange above in Phoenix.;2015-10-07 14:10:00;2-4 minutes;Something strange above in phoenix Coworker and I spotted an object dark in color traveling southwest above us while we were outside on break.  It was a clear blue day I looked up and saw this object and I asked him if he saw it too.  He replied that he saw it and said it probably the Russians in a joking way.  It traveled faster than normal civilian aircraft we see above altitude to me looked at least 10,000 feet.  Granted we see all types of aircraft fly over our building due to us being in the flight path of aircraft taking off and landing at Phoenix sky harbor airport.  There was no noise when it flew over.  Tried to keep watching it but it flew out of sight due to building in the way.  Couple minutes later I looked again and the object was now west of us and it made a tight turn and vanished.  There was no reflection from the sun on this vehicle.  I really don't know what this was.  My coworker is a 20 year air force veteran with flight status who flew on the e-4b for a number of years.  I am a air force brat who traveled on all sorts of aircraft civilian and military and was working on private pilot license.  Hope this make sense.  Thanks!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

For one thing: all aircraft have a strobe/pulsing light.  This craft did not.   The shape, unfortunately, I couldn't detect, obviously, it was at night.  The only appearance:  the light (yellowish-white, with orange-red hue) also the craft didn't make a sound not like a small plane, nor a helicopter.

I have actual footage and photos of my abduction.;2019-04-23 02:00:00;1 minutes;I have actual footage and photos of my abduction. In July of 2019 I was abducted and fortunate enough to video record and get photographs. I was relaxing in the back of my van on a beautiful rainy evening in Phoenix Arizona.  The day had already been quite weird, such as electronics not working correctly, lots of forgetfulness etc.  Anyhow, I was sitting in the pitch dark enjoying the rainfall when I was moved to turn on my video camera on my phone. I have no idea why I decided to go ahead and just start recording in the dark, but I did.  After about a minute I decided that this was stupid and it was time to go inside my friends home to sleep.  I laid on the couch and decided to watch the video.  What I captured was unbelievable. I recorded a landing of extraterrestrial nature, mind you I did not see this happening while I was recording.  It only showed up in the video. I was stunned at what my camera picked up and began to zoom in and take screenshots of the activity. The more screenshots I took the more in dept! h I saw what had happened. I saw myself walk into the craft as well as these light beings who were performing acts I did not understand. I became obsessed and couldn’t stop going deeper. The next day I became very ill and could barely function. I stayed sick for about a week before I started feeling normal again. A couple weeks down the road I felt strange and I had skipped my period. I had not been intimate with anyone for months but felt the need to get a pregnancy test. So I did and it was positive. I started to freak out because there was no way possible and I had no one to confide in. A few days later I ended up having a miscarriage and was devastated as well as relieved. Since this experience my life has never been the same. I want to share my footage and my story with others because I know I am not the only one who has experienced this.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
String of 4 stationary bright white lights in North Phoenix Sky.;2019-06-19 20:30:00;:20;String of 4 stationary bright white lights in North Phoenix Sky. I was near Union Hills Rd and Tatum Blvd, I parked my car in front of a house facing east and when I got out of my driver’s side,  I looked due North/Northwest and saw a diagonal string of 3 lights very low in the sky, with a fourth light further along the string with some space in between the 4th light and the other 3, as my video clearly depicts. I was in a hurry dropping something off and assumed they were planes, but when ingot back to my car, before I drove off I took a quick video of it because I thought wow you don’t usually see planes or aerial activity in this vicinity, since I was well north of Sky Harbor Airport by some 12 miles and these lights were well North of Scottsdale airport which would’ve been about 7-8 miles east of my location.  I saw a plane off in the distance but was pretty far away from the lights. Even though I didn’t look at them for very long, considering the time I looked upon parking my car as well as looking at them when I got back in my car to depart, the lights didn’t move.  They might’ve been flares but they were definitely white in color and shined and how a glare/glow to them, unlike the 1997 Phoenix Lights that didn’t glare or produce a corona.  There was no sound but I was very far away, maybe 3-4 miles. The 3 lights were very low in the sky, I cannot estimate how low but trees were blocking my vantage point.  And single light that was highest in the sky was maybe 5-10k fest high (?), hard to estimate.  Please refer to my video, sorry it is so short.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Then disappeared. It was very fast, the same size as a falling star but the only way we could tell it wasn’t is that it looked like when a plane is on a runway and speeds up.
