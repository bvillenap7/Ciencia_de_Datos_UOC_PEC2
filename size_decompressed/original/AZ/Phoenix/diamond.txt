I witnessed the Phoenix Lights on March 13, 1997  My mother  and wife  were watching TV and I went out to the back patio to have a cigarette around  9:00 pm  and within  minutes saw the lights moving South over Squaw Peak just east of our home. I wanted my wife to see them but was fixated on watching and figured she would not have time to get outside before they were gone. My watching time was a couple of minutes or so and I immediately knew I was seeing something not natural/normal. I was watching six or more bright orange lights in a V formation (like a boomerang) moving slowly at a low altitude. There was no sound. The minute it had passed I went in the house and told Mother and wife what I had just seen. I wondered if others had also witnessed the happening. The next morning it was big news and was seen by  hundreds from towns starting  in northern Arizona.....through Phoenix and on down to Tucson. I called the Arizona Republic and told the reporter what I had seen and assured her I was not into UFO happenings and was hopeful of an explanation.  To this day a reasonable explanation has never been given. (I am a retired corporate VP living in North Phoenix);33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
four lights in diamond config., size: laptop held at arms length. fast, silent, superstruture.;1999-08-17 19:30:00;5-10 minutes?;four lights in diamond config., size: laptop held at arms length. fast, silent, superstruture. After exiting the AMC theatre in Tempe (which was playing Sixth Sense) at about 9:30, 60 or so people were looking up at the sky toward the North. I looked up and saw four white lights spaced in the shape of a diamond. The size was about the size of a laptop computer held at arms length. There was a dark superstructure filling in the area between the lights as contrasted against the cloud cover behind it.  It hovered for a few minutes then shot off to the north, N. Phoenix, then shot back to the south, then back to the origin- al position, and then shot straight up through the clouds, dissappearing. There was no noise from it.  There was no build up of speed as most of our conventional aircraft would exhibit. It appeared to move at a constant, very rapid velocity. And did not appear to slow down. It just came to an immediate stop.  The local radio station (93.5Mz??) was asking for people, who saw it, to call in.  People from N. Phoenix did see it and called it in.  I was expecting to see it in the local paper but there was nothing at all, which is quite supprising since so many people saw it and it was talked about on a local radio station.  I am not a local. Was in town on business.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Craft with 5 lights in a tight diamond shape;2001-04-23 02:00:00;30 seconds;craft with 5 lights in a tight diamond shape I was taking my dog for a walk.  Looked up into the sky and noticed a craft up high that had five lights that made the shape of a diamond tightly together.  The craft was moving quickly towards the northeast and there was no sound.   I asked my husband if he sees it too, which he responded no.  But I know what I saw, the lights were not very bright but you could still see it.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
It was like someone ripped a pefectly shaped whole in the night sky.;2002-05-27 01:30:00;10 seconds;It was like someone ripped a pefectly shaped whole in the night sky. My fiancee and I were returning from San Diego and had been traveling North on 85 towards Phoenix, when a bright but complete solid and opaque white diamond shape gradually appeared and then abruptly dissappeared in the sky due west of our driving position.  A train was directly East of us and we had been watching it for a number of minutes because between the almost full moon above it-it was quite beautiful-and not much else to look at in the Arizona desert at night on a long drive. The reason it probably caught our attention was because it was so very very strange and large-larger then the moon is size in the sky.  But what was so incomprehensible is that it appeared like someone or something had simply ripped open a whole in the dark sky leaving a huge opaque white diamond shape, then in just a few seconds-just enough to comprehend somewhat what we were looking at-it slowly but perfectly evenly from the top down disappeared!  It did not fade out-nor just turn off it's light-because it didn't glow, but more like something rolling back up perfectly.  I did not write this report before-because it didn't appear to be a flying saucer or anything of the more common UFO shapes, and didn't know if it would fit here.  It had perfectly straight edges-no variance in color or intensity of color and only white.It also did not appear to be 3-D. I have traveled the Arizona roads at night probably about 50 times at least and never seen anything like this.  It was so incredible a thing to see-it's easier to understand the flight of unknown objects-then wrap your mind around the sky doing something like that!;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
lights hovering over a mountain range near the Cave Creek Rd approximately between Union Hills Rd and Greenway Rd.;2005-05-18 21:45:00;10 minutes;Aprroximately around 21:45 I was Travelling westbound on the Loop 101 North Freeway in Phoenix. Happen to be looking south and noticed three lights hovering over a mountain range near the Cave Creek Rd approximately between Union Hills Rd and Greenway Rd.  Then shortly after three more lights appeared I don't know if it was from the same object or not. I tried to get a solid picture of this event but was travelling in the faster lane and didn't have a tripod so I didn't have a steady hand to take this picture.  No later than 10 minutes later there was three helicopters flying around this area travelling east to west flashing strobe lights.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Many lights moving in close formation. then going in differnt directions. VERY bright red lights;2011-01-02 19:12:00;0ver 15 min;Many lights moving in close formation. then going in differnt directions. VERY bright red lights Witnessed 5 or 6 srange craft in the northern sky flying in close formation. All of the sudden the changed direction. all going in different direction, quickly. many other cars on the road must have seen the same thing because they put on their brakes and pulled over to the side of the road. while I am writing this to you we still have two VERY bright red lights in the northern sky.   I have never seen something this brilliant red. While observing them with binoculars, another light flew down near the others. Like it was going to close to the ground.  We have seen many small aircraft all the time and if this was one it would have crashed into the ground.  The sighting is still going on while I am writing you.  The sky seems wery active tonight and we are continuing to see more strange things. the time started around 7:00 pm and it is now 7:43.  Again the objects were too close to all be aircraft because they looked like they would have colided in mid air.  Then very suddenly the moved very quickly.  There must be more witnesses from the reaction of the cars pulling over to the side of the road.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
They were close enough to get a good look but not a good recording.;2014-11-27 18:45:00;15 minutes;They were close enough to get a good look but not a good recording. I was driving on the I17.  Just past the airport and on the right, over a neighborhood, you could see them.  Real bright diamond and hexagon shaped orange lights.  The pattern looked like if they were being held up like a string of lights. I pulled off and went into the neighborhood to take a look and see what they were to find that they were free moving objects slowly heading south easterly.  From the bottom they appeared round and looked to be weather or hot air balloons.  At first there were three. They were close enough to tell that they certainly were not balloons.  They were low and holding elavation. As soon as the first one got in what would have been almost right over the airport.  We could see what looked like a cloth or shading extend out and fold over the bottom.  Which darkened it from all sides and made the bottom appear to match the stars at a much further distance.  Fortunately we have a lot of smoke looming over the city from a mulch fire which made the shadings visible slightly enough too see it eventually disappearing from view.  As soon as the first one went out the other two followed.  They picked up speed and were gone in seconds. Suddenly another one appears.  And then a much larger one appeared brighter and closer to the first three.  And did the same thing.  Another one appeared to come back around from where the others left.  And then reversed and disappeared.  Definitely not planes helicopters or weather balloons.   Attempted to call the airport, they blew me off.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Diamond shaped crafts test my perception and direction following abilities.;2017-04-14 23:00:00;90 minutes;Diamond shaped crafts test my perception and direction following abilities. Having only been aware of the extraterrestrial presence for the past two weeks or so, I have been watching the night sky every chance I get.  On 4/09/2017 at approximately 23:00, I was sitting at the park and saw a bright white light hovering just above the trees on the eastern horizon.  The light was roughly the size of a street light, but the apparent distance indicates that the light originated from a larger source.  It was blinking but I'm not sure if was in a pattern.  Upon seeing this light, I was filled with a great sense of fear and felt an intense need to go home. After making it back home, I lied down outside to watch the sky some more. At approximately 01:00 on 04/10/2017 (later that same night) the craft reappeared, hovering above the trees on the southern horizon this time.  It was blinking at me the same way, as if testing to see if I was aware of their presence.  I froze, gazed fixed on the bright, blinking light, and suddenly it was gone.  I did not see it leave. Then on 04/14/2017 at approximately 22:00 the blinking light was back.  As soon as I noticed it, it flew away in a direction that was hard to see.  Shortly after, a craft with two solid white lights on the sides, a blinking white light at the front, and a blinking red light at the back made several passes over my house.  I concentrated on these crafts, as they could have been normal airplanes, but the positioning of the lights was unlike any plane that I have seen before.  The next pass (always from south to north) I held my arm up and thought the words Is that you?  A few minutes later three crafts passed overhead simultaneously. Two from a greater distance, with the two lights on the side and the blinking lights in the front and back, and another much closer.  The one that passed closer to me was diamond shaped, but didn't appear flat, almost like a prism with a glowing orange light in the middle and around the sides. At this point I decided to walk to the park to get a better view of the night sky.  In the distance I could see something hovering that would blink a white light on the left side and a red light on the right side.  I felt like it wanted me to follow it.  I went in the direction that I thought it wanted me to go, and waited for further instruction. I don't think that I followed their directions correctly at first, so I started walking in another direction when one of the larger crafts with the two white lights on the sides made a low pass above me.  I was able to see it more clearly. From below, it was diamond shaped with four smaller diamond shaped quadrants.  The sides where they has the two solid white lights could light up with green or red all across, so I think they were trying to imitate regular airplanes for camouflage purposes while remaining distinct so I could follow them. There would always be one hovering in the distance while the other would make passes above me.  After awhile, I noticed that both of the crafts would alter which direction was blinking white or red, as if to tell me to go in the direction of the white light. They led me a few blocks over, to a side street with a culdesac.  At this point it was around 23:30 and most houses were quiet, except for one.  The house at the end of the culdesac had the garage door open, light on, with a man sitting, seemingly waiting.  I hesitated, for I did not want to appear insane, walking up to a strangers house in the middle of the night with no logical explanation.  The blinking continued in the direction of the mans house, along with another pass from above.  I finally mustered the courage to approach the house, but the man was gone. I started walking home, still watching the sky. Getting closer to home, the crafts appeared to be trying to lead me once again. They brought me through the park, to a dark corner where there were few houses around.  I heard what sounded like two birds chirping at me from the trees, and walked around the area for a moment, looking for signs. The chirping sounded almost like the words, 'Over here,' and when I started to walk away, it changed to a panicked, 'Come back.'  I wasn't sure if my mind was playing tricks on me, but I went back.  Looked around, saw nothing, started walking away again.  This time the chirps were more like high pitched beeps, like an electronic signal.  I turned a flashlight to the tree and saw nothing, but the sound went back to being chirps.  The chirps were telling me 'right here, below you' so I looked around the base of the tree and found a small light that is manufactured by a company here in Phoenix. I've read that an electrical company has had communications with ET life but I have not followed up on the lead as of yet. I saw the diamond crafts again last night (04/15/2017) at approximately 21:30, making several passes over my home, but I was unable to follow them this time.  I feel like they can hear my thoughts when they are in close range, like they know I'd like to meet them.  I do not feel as if these being have malicious intent, but they may be part of the collective.  I can feel a sort of pressure in the middle of my forehead when they are around, but I can't be certain if that is a placebo effect or not as I have read about the pineal gland and how many consider it to be the 'third eye'  I plan on investigating further.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Today at Phoenix.;2018-12-18 14:00:00;3 minutes;Today at Phoenix. Hello Sr . I was in the back porch in my wheelchair a few hour ago, when I was coming back inside the house, a hummingbird caught my attention, so I pulled my iPad and took a few pictures of him.  When I was back inside looked at the same location, but don’t know what picture is it.

Straight line, there were 10-12 points of light, they looked like bright stars, but were travelling in unison, at the same speed. The middle one (#7) broke out of formation, dipped down, and re-joined the group. The line travelled in right-to-left, and formed a streak in the sky, as if a meteor was breaking apart. Again, all the points were the same speed, in unison. The north-south trajectory slanted into the sky, and dissappeared over the next 10 seconds into the atmosphere.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
