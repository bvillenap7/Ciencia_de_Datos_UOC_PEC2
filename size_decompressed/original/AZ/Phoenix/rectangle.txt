Large rectangle object making no noise.;1993-09-01 20:15:00;1 minute;Large rectangle object making no noise. I saw this object so many years ago and the year and month are correct, but the day could be off it was sometime around the first half of the month. I was in my backyard, looking at the sky.  The night was calm and quiet, the sky was partly cloudy (but the clouds were sitting lower than normal at approximately 7000 to 8000 feet),  and no planes were in the area.  I lived approximately 8 or so miles east from Luke AFB. At about 2015 hours or so, I noticed blue lights, lighting up a large cloud to the south of my house.  The blue color that I can describe is like a welders blue light a bright dark blue color.  This light appeared from the cloud about 2 to 3 times in a short period of time.  The light looked to be coming out of the cloud but there was no visible beam to it, so I was not sure if it was making it to the ground.  Oddly enough on the final light flash, I did here someone yell to the south of me about a light flash, but I don't know if this was related. After that, approximately 30 or so seconds later a large rectangle object came out of this cloud slowly , but increase speed quickly.  The object had many sets of lights all over the haul and there were no viable wings on it.  The objects structure looked metallic bluish-gray in color.  The object made zero noise.  At the speed it was traveling and the size of the object not hearing any sound from it made the sighting very uneasy. The object traveled through a few more clouds and went west heading towards Luke AFB, but ended up shooting up into the sky and almost vanishing in seconds. a few minutes after I lost track of the object, I smell something similar to burning electronics or something like that and my eye became a little irritated.  I am not sure if this was related or if a neighbor was doing something funny. The size of the object is hard to explain.  The size of the object was something I could never think that could fly, a specially with no wings nor making a sound. Being retired career military and having clearances.  I have very good knowledge of military aircraft both known and kept secret, long with civilian aircraft.  I have no clue what this is or was..  this was tattooed to my brain that night.  I only now come forward because  my story should be told.  I never saw another object in the sky after that but this was enough for me.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
A massive object in the sky, that shined a light in front of me that was very weird....;1993-09-10 20:30:00;1 minute;A massive object in the sky, that shined a light in front of me that was very weird.... this happened when Iwas ten years old and around sept. 10th 1993. It was after dark on apartly cloudy night with the moon out there was no other aircaft around and the weather was good. Every Friday evening my Mom and I would walk around the school I was going to for fun Etc. on the way back about half a block from my house I was looking down and was about 7 feet behind my mom  Out of nowhere a very bright dark blue light flashes on the ground right in front of me. the best way to describe this light is it looks like the light you would see at the bottom of a pool with the water moving kinda like bubbles but not kinda like electricity, but not very weird but pretty I guess you could say the light had no noise to it. Once is saw the light i looked up to the sky and there happened to be a opening in the clouds that was a good 2 to 3 miles wide. there was a very large cloud behind me, but I saw nothing. I began to think it was so funny lightining or something like that. At this point I ask my mom did you see that she said no. At about the same time we both lookedagain to see anything one more time and out of the cloud comes a very very very large rectangle object at a very fast speed going west tored Luke Air Force Base about 7 miles west of where I am at. I lost track of it in the clouds about ten seconds after I saw it, but in those ten seconds it was proable 7 miles away already. The Clouds that night where about normal alttuide and like I said earlier the opening was about 2 to 3 miles long and about a mile wide this object was bigger then the opening in the clouds I want to say it was 12 to 15 aircarft carries long and 6 to 8 wide it was HUGH. The object had a ton of lights on it all over the place they could have been in a pattern , but it went by so fast and unexpectedly was unable to see that. The one thing I did notice was the back end of the object, the back end was all white/blue lights kinda like a rocket area or where the engines are at. The object looked to have a blueish silver metal on it. The object made no noise at all and did not displace a cloud that was the weirdest part of all for something that big, that fast, and with what looked simalur to rockets on back that was just not right. I have been a beleaver ever since. I have never seen or heard of anyhting like this ever again. also to note for the next hour after seening this my eyes were burning. if you have any questions please contact me thanks  P.S. I also saw the Phoenix lights and those in any way where not flares, even if they were there not going to do any military trainning where they were at becasue it was over a Indain resrevion and that test area they were talking about its near yuma Arizona 95 miles south west of Phoenix ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

03/15/1997, 21:15 Phoenix, Arizona 20 rectangular objects in V formation, performed circular spin, etc.;1997-03-13 21:15:00;approx. 10 min.;03/15/1997, 21:15 Phoenix, Arizona 20 rectangular objects in V formation, performed circular spin, etc. March 15, 1997 Possible UFO Sighting over northwest metro Phoenix, Arizona. Location: Observed from side street near major intersection of 43rd Ave. and Peoria Ave. Sighted multiple objects flying in formation, first noticed in SSE position moving south to north. Objects had a slight tan, copper toned color, which I at first thought might be the reflection of city streetlights. As they approached closer, nearly overhead, they appear uniform in color and seemed to be illuminated with a glow similar to Christmastime luminaria (candles placed in brown paper sacks or bags).  I could not tell the altitude of the objects.  They were moving due north in a wide “V” formation.  There were about ten objects in each arm of the “V” all the same rectangular (shaped like a postage stamp, slightly longer in the north-south dimension, the direction of travel).  Meantime, a commercial airliner was climbing out on a NE heading as if it were heading for Denver (very noisy) to my left that would place it over the far northwest area of Glendale, probably over 67th Ave. and Bell Rd. or slightly farther north, possibly over 67th Ave. and Union Hills Rd.  I was riding a bicycle on a dark side street facing east.  As I recall, the evening was clear and moonless.  I figured that the “V” formation would cross the path of the jet airliner and I would be able to get an idea of the altitude and size of the objects as they intersected with the airliner.  As the “V” formation approached overhead, slightly to the east, if low, possibly traveling above 35th Avenue. If higher, they possibly would be above Black Canyon Freeway (I-17), over the Metrocenter regional shopping mall.  The “V” formation was not directly overhead, but slightly to the east of me at an undetermined altitude. As I watched the “V” formation approach the point directly east of me, the objects did a coordinated maneuver: They moved out along the “V” and spun in a coordinated circular pattern and then moved close together in a circular group packed tightly but none of them overlapping.  They moved out of the “V” formation in opposite directions and formed two separated circular clusters.  In doing this complicated maneuver, they never changed speed or their north-south orientation.  The motion out of the “V” formation reminded me of the Paramount logo at the start of Hollywood movies where the star flow up an around the mountain forming a circle of stars. This happened out of the arms of the “V” forming a rotating circle of rectangular objects that then tightened the circle into a paced grouping also having a roughly circular perimeter with all the objects maintaining their north-south direction only now formed into two separate circular tightly packed cluster – still moving toward the jet airliner.  The separation between the two clusters was approximately the length of the ends of the “V” when I first saw it and when it reached the point direct east of me..  These objects continued moving due north and at some point would intersect the path of the jet airliner – either In front of it or behind it – at least one or the other of the now two separate circular tightly packed clusters.  The jet airliner continued NE.  The two clusters were moving toward the rear quarter of the plane and I was sure one of the cluster would intersect and pass over the plane either above it or below it and that would give me some idea of their relative size and altitude.  As the two clusters moved toward the rear quarter of the plane, probably at about a 45 degree angle if a passenger on the plane were looking back over the plane’s horizontal tail assembly.  As both clusters approached the plane and reached a point fairly close, both clusters simultaneously blinked invisible – as if the simultaneously and instantly turned on some kind of “cloaking” effect that rendered them invisible.  Neither cluster passed over or under the plane.  They just suddenly turned invisible.  The jet airliner continued it NE heading, the pilot or crew or passengers, unaware that a large cluster of rectangular objects had nearly intercepted it.  When I arrived home, about a half mile from where this sighting occurred, I looked in the White Pages and found two listings for UFO reporting.  The first one I called rang with no answer.  The second one I called, UFO Watch I think was the name, located in Fountain Hills east of Scottsdale.  The man I talked to said it was extremely unusual to see rectangular objects and even more unusual to see multiple rectangular objects.  He said the complex coordinated maneuvers I described the objects performing would not be possible from any current technology he was aware of.  The U.S. Air Force didn’t have anything capable of such a complicated, coordinated maneuver and they certainly would not perform something as complicated as the circular spin and tight formation clustering over a densely populated city such as Phoenix.  He told me to make a note of what I had seen and leave it at that.  He said no one would believe me.  I told him that I had two thoughts.  One was that this was the first UFO sighting I had ever experienced and couldn’t believe that it occurred over a metropolitan area.  I thought UFO sightings usually were seen over remote, rural areas.  And second, that this occurred in the early evening and surely I wasn’t the only one who had witnessed it.  People would be out playing tennis or shooting baskets or doing other outdoor activities and would have seen the same “V” formation and the maneuvers that I had seen.  I watched the news the next couple of days and never heard any report of such a sighting or similar UFO report.  I find it hard to believe that I was the only one who witnessed this unusual event.  There was a different sighting reported over Phoenix of some kind of unusual “lights” but they were moving in the opposite direction, from what I have heard, moving from north to south.  I told the man in Fountain Hills that I was sure that if I went out and purchased some video or photography equipment that it was unlikely that I would encounter such an unusual display of UFO mass coordinated maneuvers in the rest of my lifetime.  I probably would be wasting my time expecting to see such a sighting again and hoping to record it on videotape or on photographic film.  But what I had witnessed spanned about ten minutes at the most, maybe not that long.  The objects were not moving very fast, no faster than the jet airliner.  If I move my hand to trace the movement of the objects, the time lapse is more like one or two minutes, possibly less than one minute.  When I first saw the “V” formation, it was about halfway between the hor! izon to the SE and zenith looking due East.  This is the first time I have ever given a written report of that sighting.  I have told family and friends what I saw.  Each time a movie started showing the Paramount Pictures-Gulf & Western stars spinning in a circle, I would mention that’s what I saw those UFO objects do as they moved out of the “V” formation.

Chrome garbage can in my field of view of high flying jet.;2001-02-04 10:51:00;5 minutes;Chrome garbage can in my field of view of high flying jet. I noticed a high flying jet -single vapor trail(short) very high over me in beautiful clear blue skies.It was heading south to north.I went to find my binocs since it was so high-just a speck I was curious.It was right straight up. By the time I got back it was at 1100 if I were in the clock center. I trained on it and saw clean wings with vertical attachments at the very end. It was a plane. As I moved the binocs to the left a silvery object was just sitting in the sky-looked like a chrome garbage can tipped a bit.It seemed to be as high as the jet maybe lower to the west a bit. It was motionless and then it made two like surges to the south equal to 3/4s of my viewing lens.(These were 7x50 Tasco). Then it was stationary and either went poof or straight up-it seemed like both. My friend says it was a weather balloon.Whatever-it was real cool to see.

This object;2002-01-12 21:30:00;:08;While sitting around the campfire, my son and I observed a rectangular object in the north east skies of northern Phoenix.  This object was slowly spinning between two prominent stars, and appered to be receeding, i.e., traveling away from earth.  The skies were clear, with little light polution from the city.  As I recall, there was no moon.  My son and I watched this object for approximately :08 minutes.  As there was no way to judge it's size I can say only that it was massive.  At arms length it would be approximately the size of ones thumb.  It was white in color, similar to the moon.  It's surface was marked with relatively dark areas.  As it spun, or rotated, it appered to be a thin object (relatively).  It eventually grew dimmer and dimmer until it disappeared.  Asteroid? Possibly.  Again its an unknown!

UFO Sighting on North Mountain in Phoenix;2005-02-04 00:00:00;1-2 minutes;UFO Sighting on North Mountain in Phoenix The sighting was on North Mountain in Phoenix.  I used to climb to the top of North Mountain every night for excersize. Coming down one night, I saw what I first thought was an airplane, but it came closer and it looked like it had slowed down quite a bit, ruling out an airplane, at which point I thought it was a helicopter and became alarmed (sometimes police helicopters fly over North Mountain park, which closes at 11:00 PM, I did not want to be spot lighted). I was eyeing the aircraft very closely to see if it was in fact a helicopter and because it was approaching North Mountain.  It was flying very slowly at some point, and I was looking directly at it, trying to make it out against a black sky. I caught the first glimpse of its shape, it had lights on it, like a helicopter would, but the rear of the aircraft was square.  I became very confused, trying to figure out what kind of aircraft was 'square'. Also, it was very quiet, helicopters make a lot of noise, even from a distance, this one wasnt making any noise at all. I continued to stare at the aircraft, caught a second glipse of it, and the shape looked definitely square from the back end (couldnt make out the front end because of the lights on the aircraft). At this point, I became nervous, I was starting to panic, I moved into a dark area off the paved road under a small ridge to keep myself from being seen.  The aircraft flew nearly overhead from where I was standing, and it literally dipped down towards the gorge area, flew back up a little and circled around the peak across the gorge (this was the peak where the radio antennas are located). The aircraft must have not been more than 50 feet from me at one instant. It was black and sqare shaped aircraft, made a quiet turbine machine like noise, I had no idea of what this was, but it was right in my face, so to speak, and I was mortally terrified. What went through my mind in that instant was not good, I was really scared, I wanted to run away at full speed down the mountain towards the apartments where I lived. I just wanted to get out of there, quick, but I also realized that any movements might cause me to be detected by whatever that aircraft was.  After the aircraft circled around the North Mountain peak, I did not see it again. I was worried that it might circle back around, but it didnt. I somehow consoled myself by thinking that whatever that was, it was not looking for me. After a few minutes, I started back down the road briskly in an effort to get to the other side of the ridge, so if it did circle back around then I would be obscured from its path. On the way down, I considered calling the police when I got back to my apartment, but then I realized that I wouldnt have been taken seriously.  I continued to climb North Mountain after that, but only in daylight hours. I didnt think running into something like that would ever happen again, however, the incident had shaken me up pretty badly and I did avoid climbing up at night after that.  Previous to this incident, I did not believe in UFOs and when somebody mentioned it I would go so far as to get upset and try to prove to them that they do not exist and it is impossible by the laws of physics to cover great distances in anyones lifetime.  After witnessing this, it is obvious to me that they do exist because I saw one, although I dont understand it or how it could be possible. But I still saw it. i can speculate that maybe the reason why it was flying over that area was because of the radio antennas? At any rate, I had a close up visual of the aircraft, it was not a helicopter, and it could not be anything else because of its extremely low altitude at the final moment of the sighting. Aside from the fact that helicopters are obvious and make a great deal of noise, not even a helicopter would fly that low in that area because of electric lines that go across the mountains (danger of hitting an electic line).;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

I dismissed it as a plane or helicopter but caught my attention even more when the light traveled in the sky in a southwest direction and met a smaller light.  The two lights then began to move together at the same time with an equal distance the whole time toward the Estrella Mountains.  Between the two lights it was completely black and blocked the light from all the stars it passed in the sky making the shape of a very large rectangle.   Eventually the lights faded away and we could not see them anymore.   What is very interesting is the whole time this black craft was in the sky and nobody even noticed it until the large white light met up with it.

The object remained south east in the sky for over 48 minutes from 5:15pm to 6:03pm. The shape of the single object was like an upside down top hat or boiling pot.  During this time, it floated very gradually from left to right.  It also repeatedly grew smaller then back to its original size.  When smaller, it created a bird shape and then it would change back to the upside down top hat/boiling pot formation. As it grew darker, the object lowered in the sky.  Once fully dark, it became lit with faint red and white lights. At 6:03pm it disappeared. Compared to the airplanes landing at Sky Harbor Airport at the time, the object looked over 5 times bigger in size.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

It was a clear day, about 1pm, when I crossed 15th Ave. when I noticed a bright glare to the south. It appeared to be a reflection of a plane, but it wasn’t moving.  I noticed it was only 20-30 feet above the roofline of the houses along the road almost buoyant.  It seemed only 100 yards from me.  The center was about 8 feet long, maybe 1 foot in height, and very bright white (like magnesium).  It had light “spires” extending from the left and right horizontally. Now I thought it might have been a toy rocket (residential area), but it was too bright for that.  The light did not shimmer, twinkle, or shift.  I could not figure out what it was, it did not smoke like a flare or move. After about 10 seconds as I was watching, it just disappeared.  I watched it vanish!  There was no object to say what it was, no smoke trail, no nothing –like turning off a switch, the light was gone.

DOGS WERE HOWLING FOR FIRST TIME-19:06 12/10/13 At 7:06 p.m., I was sitting outside at our home in Laveen (SW Phoenix) and letting my dog play.  I was in the backyard where we have full view of high skies and much flight activity as close to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and Air Force Bases. I was standing and an enormous and brilliantly white in color light caught my eye as the it seemed to literally fall from the sky and quick over the house and neighborhood and then to the ground. It came from what appeared to be the North and East direction (saw as quick came over roof of home) and the immense and very intense bright white light dropped in the just near South and just East or possibly just Southerly direction.  The area where it flew over seemed to be almost right above the front of our home and heading rapidly towards the ground and South Mountain part.  The bright light was very intense and large and appeared too close to be real.  We did NOT hear any explosion or landing noise.  We did, for the very first time we've lived here, hear dogs HOWLING. It was so large that clearly others have seen and will report.  I had thought to call 911 but thought I could not really tell them what it was or where it landed. I have seen meteor shower and stars falling.  They burn out quickly and don't appear to ever be lower than the very busy aircraft that are constantly in the air.  The Airport closest is about 10 miles due East and we see departures and arriving flights around the clock, along with military craft performing maneuvers and plenty of high altitude large craft mostly coming from the West or likely California and passing far above the local traffic.  This was in a fairly spherical shape but the light was SO BRIGHT and SO WHITE that it seemed like it may have been very large-nothing I have ever seen in 40 years.  I've never reported anything like this, never have seen anything like this and hope that you and others can locate where this landed and hopefully it didn't land or crash in a populated area.  It's too early online to see comments from NEWS, etc.  But MANY private and commercial craft were in the air at this time.  This was far below even where helicopters fly.  Thanks for listening.

Right above me a little to the west I saw a strange orb of lights that seemed to change from orange to whole to red and the lights were hovering. I'm a pilot and look up at planes all the time. My first thought was a drone with some weird lights attached. There was no sound. I stared up at it for about 1 min. Then it started moving. The lights started to fade and now I could see at large black rectangle moving slowly to the east. It was a full moon and scattered clouds, but the sky was a gray color with the full moon. A couple white lights winked on this black rectangle then it went completely black. It was such a dark  dark black color. Initially I thought this object was low, maybe 500 ft, but as it glided silently across the sky I saw it went above the the broken clouds. I've never seen anything glide so smoothly. It was the shape of a Hersey bar. It picked move slowly as it glided away completely black but I coul! d clearly see it's shape in the light night sky I watched it until it moved behind clouds. I was really in shock. I thought that's either some very advanced secret aircraft of ours or a UFO. It was amazing. I went inside and told a family member a nd texted a friend. I went on the internet to see if there was any news about this. I even called one of the local news networks to ask them if they had gotten any reports. I also check the weather to see what the cloud layer height was to get an idea of how big this really was. The pilot wether briefing I read said the clouds were scattered at 9500 feet. This object was above them and went through them at times. Based on that altitude Id guess the object was about 100 ft x 50 ft. I'll never forget this sighting. I already believed we are being visited by other planets. Now I can say I know for sure. This had to be a UFO.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Unidentified object seen over Phoenix in February of 2020.;2020-02-18 16:00:00;1 minute;Unidentified object seen over Phoenix in February of 2020. Unfortunately we waited too long to report this that we are unsure of the date and time but it was approximately in February of 2020.  We were traveling eastbound on the 101 and were on the exit ramp from the 101 onto northbound I-17.  I was traveling with my spouse and I saw a single, large black or dark gray,  tiered, rectangular object hovering over the area.  The area it appeared to hover over was both residential and commercial.  I thought to myself is that a balloon?  But it clearly was not.  The size was hard to judge as I was navigating through the narrow, concrete wall bordered exit ramp.  If I had to guess, I’d say about 200’ to one city block. The one thing I remember was that it looked industrial.  Almost like floors of a factory with metal railings.  Once I quickly realized it was something I couldn’t explain, I asked my wife to look and see if she sees it.  She did see it.  I asked her what she saw and she described it as a “black object, multi tiered, just floating there.”  She agrees with my potential size estimation.  From where we were, we could only see it we curved around on the ramp and then we lost site of it as we proceeded onto I-17.  It was not a balloon.  It was not a helicopter.  It was not a plane, as it was not moving.  How long it remained visible in the location, I do not know.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
