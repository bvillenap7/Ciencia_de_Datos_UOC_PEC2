a large black object kind of like a shadow passed over head while we were waiting for the fire works to start;1997-07-04 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;a large black object kind of like a shadow passed over head while we were waiting for the fire works to start We had parked in a dark lot in downtown phoenix to watch the fireworks.  We were sitting in a convertable with the top down.  While my daughter was looking around at the crowd of people walking around, I was star gazing and watching the local tv helicopters flying in a big circle around the downtown area.   I looked down for a second to say something to my daughter and when I looked up again, I made a comment that the copters must have run out of gas because they were gone.  Still looking up, I noticed what i thought was a huge cloud passing over head but it was I thought to low to be a cloud and was moving too fast, and against the wind, from north to south. Before Icould get my daughter to see it it had passed.   Well she didn't belive but I convinced her to watch the sky with me.  Well the copters returned after awhile but than left again as fast as they had come back .we thought they went to refuel still looking up Isaw it again.   This time my daughter saw it and we watched it for what seemed like minutes all the while describing to each other what we were seeing we both agree it was big and dark with no lights like a giant shadow that blocked out the stars as it passed.  Soon after the copters returned we never saw it again.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

cylindrical object with an exterior glow;2002-07-20 08:30:00;10 seconds;cylindrical object with an exterior glow My wife saw it as it cleared a neighbors house, from the west just next door from us, when she yelled for me to come out and see this. As I stepped outside, my wife was pointing up, and I saw the object right away. It was cylinder in shape, it was a charcol gray, with pale blue/gray ouline, that seemed to glow. Other than the shape, and the ouline glow, it moved fast and silent thru the sky. There was no sound as it moved. On two opposite sides of of the object, there were two curved points that went towards the inside of the object. It seemed to tumble as it moved thru the sky. It moved in a smooth and swift manner and then disappeared thru the trees in a north easterly direction.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Rainbow light in sky above Phoenix;2005-01-16 04:00:00;current;Rainbow light in sky above Phoenix My fiancee was walking the dog and called me outside to look at very bright multi-colored sparkling light in sky. After taking a look at it, I ran and grabbed the binoculars and we both looked at it and it seemed to be emitting a rainbow of constant clear true colors of red, green, blue, white and yellow. The lights seemed to be coming from  a diagonal line off one side of the craft, but the shape of the craft was hard to see, since small and at a great distance in Southwest sky about 45degrees above the horizon. Very very bright, and never seen any star in that location prior to this. We watched it for several minutes starting from him viewing it at about 3:45 and still present as of this writing in same location in sky, but seems to have been moving very very slowly Northwest. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be quite  serious-minded and credible.  We explored whether the witnesses might be observing the star, Sirius, which is quite prominent in the southern sky during the winter months.  She looked again on the following night, and asserted that the object was not visible on that date, seemingly ruling out a star.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS)) Follow-up to initial sighting at 04:00 on 01/16/05, upon checking after turning in intial report object was gone at 04:19 a.m. from our visible location.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

A White/ Silver cylindrical object that seemed to hover high above the Paradise Valley/ North Phoenix area.;2006-11-26 12:00:00;3 minutes;A White/ Silver cylindrical object that seemed to hover high above the Paradise Valley/ North Phoenix area. I was sitting in my car that was facing north in the crowded Best Buy parking lot near the PV Mall waiting for my wife and a friend at about noon or a few minutes after. The sky was crystal clear and no visible clouds.  As I waited, I noticed a cylindrical object that was high in the northern sky.  I thought that it was a balloon, but noticed that it seemed motionless.  I would guess that it was well above 5,000 feet in altitude.  The object was whitish/ silver and seemed to be the size of an airliner, but it was difficult to judge, since it was so high up and there was no other reference points in the clear blue sky.   This object stayed in the same location for about 3 minutes.  I was distracted briefly by a phone call and when I returned to the sky, I noticed that the object had disappeared.  I searched the sky and there was nothing.   I then noticed two high flying jets and their contrails, their flightpath took them directly through the same area where the object was hovering previously.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Two identical objects sighted over Phoenix Arizona.;2013-07-19 21:40:00;10 minutes;two identical objects sighted over Phoenix Arizona. I witnessed what appeared to be two cylindrical objects at approximately 9:40 pm.   They appeared to move in unison, maintaining an equal distance between them.  They only appeared cylindrical through binoculars. Pentax 12x50 were used.  They appeared as bluish points of light with the naked eye.  They almost seemed tethered together with an invisible nearly rigid connection.                                                          I live on the west side of Phoenix Az.,  Not far from mid-town.   The general movement was to the northwest, away from me.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Strange red lights in Phoenix Sky, just now.;2016-07-19 00:10:00;45 seconds;Strange red lights in Phoenix Sky, just now. I woke up, out of the blue at 12:10am.  I could not sleep, so I heated up some leftovers and sat on couch with lights off, in order to not wake my fianc√© and baby.   As I was eating, I noticed a group of red lights flying west to east that caught my attention.  The lights stopped and hovered for about 10 seconds, flashed different colored lights, and then started heading west again.   15 seconds later, it was back, but this time flying like a hummingbird, stop go, stop go, stop go.   I have never in my life seen anything fly like this.  It was definitely NOT man made.  This UFO seemed to be scanning or taking pictures of something near my backyard.   After it flashed red lights a few times, it just zoomed away heading west, till I could not see it anymore.   This thing made NO SOUND WHATSOEVER!  Did anyone one else see it/them?  I'm glad to know we are definitely not alone here. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Clear as day, a long cyndrical object was seen moving outside 100 ft beyond and under the left wing. I was in seat 17a on flight AA475 from SFO to PHX.  It passed in the opposite direction of the plane. I have never reported a sighting of this nature, do not believe in conspiracies, am well educated etc. I filed a report with the local FBI upon landing and wanted to make the sighting public as well. Concerned with safety of future travel if this continues. Other details there was a black (engine) trail coming from the object. If there is video from the plane cockpit, look between 4:59 and 5:02 pm.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
