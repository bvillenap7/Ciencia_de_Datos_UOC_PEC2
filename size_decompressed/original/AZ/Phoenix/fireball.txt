Bright flickering, lightning like flash, white/yellow glowing sparks, followed by three dull booms after 2-3 minutes;1998-06-07 21:05:00;2 seconds;Bright flickering, lightning like flash, white/yellow glowing sparks, followed by three dull booms after 2-3 minutes Walking east on the 1300 West block of Mountain Sky.  The major cross street near this area is 13th Avenue & Chandler Blvd.  Observed bright flickering from above.  Thought it was just a street lamp turning on. Flickering was very bright white-blue, like lightning.  Looked up, to see a streak of very bright sparks falling towards the South, at an angle of about 40 degrees.  These sparks were at first white, but then quickly dulled to orange.  Met a neighbor about two or three minutes later, who also saw the bright flash, and asked us if we had seen it.  We responded yes, then heard a series of at least three low booms, much like distant thunder.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

I saw a green fireball in the sky and there was definitely an aircraft behind the ball of light.;1998-12-19 03:57:00;3 minutes;I saw a green fireball in the sky and there was definitely an aircraft behind the ball of light. At about 3:55 a.m on December 19, 1998 I was outside of my work on break. I look to the east and saw a green ball of light flash on in the sky. I saw a video of a green fire ball on TV a few months ago and this was the same thing. Right above the tree top I saw the green ball of light come on and for a split second I could clearly see an aircraft either producing or behind the ball of light. It slowly went down behind the tree top and disappeared. About a minute later I saw it come up from behind the trees. It did not come on this time it was already on. It stayed above the tree top for a few seconds then went back down. I then saw a flash of red light from the same direction. At that time my break was over so that was all I observed, but I clearly an aircraft behind the ball of light. The ball of light was the same color as the green light from a red light it looked like an artificial light not a fire ball. This incident was observed from Thomas and 33rd Avenue.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Report at first denied by PPD then acknowledged. I have waited a while to report this just to see if any of the local media would do anything with it.Apparently they are not aware or have chosen to ignore it. It is quite an amazing sighting. I first heard about it in Novemer of 99, from a co-worker who heard a short news segment on it on 910 AM KFYI here in Phoenix, which is Art Bells local affiliate. When my friends son contacted the station they stated they knew nothing about it. When he told them they had done a news segment on it, they said they would research it for him. A representative from KFYI contacted him via e-mail and supplied him with a transcript of the conversation between the crew of the PPD helicopter (Firebird) and the crew of another helicopter .According to my friend, when KFYI contacted Phx P.D. about this they at first denied it, and later when told about the transcript said the conversation took place but that they had no further comment. I am calling this object a fireball only because this is what my friend said he heard it described as on the radio. It is pretty obvious from the conversation that whatever it was, it appeared to be under intelligent control. Hope this is of some interest to you.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

0105 hours, streaming flash of golden objects.;2001-09-30 01:05:00;ten seconds;0105 hours, streaming flash of golden objects. I had just finished swimming in my pool.  I was toweling off when a fast moving 'golden flash' caught my eye.  I looked up and saw two extremely fast moving objects flying through the sky coming towards my North Phoenix home (trajectory was southwest headed northeast). However, the objects flew on a heading to the northwest. As the objects flew past my home, I saw a third light (object?), also golden. The objects resembled chaffe or flares, but they were not falling.  They were moving horizontally and at an extremely fast clip..  They appeared to be flying in a very tight bunch. I expected the objects to fall towards the earth, but they elevated at that time.  I then went inside to see if any explosions had been reported in the area.  I checked the net & televised news.  Nothing at this time. Immediate thoughts: Shooting stars (much too close to the ground), asteroids/space debris...errant missles from an F-16 (Luke Air Force Base is located in the direction that the objects came from, approx. 15 miles from my home). I must point out that I've seen F-16's at night and during the day. A friend used to work on them at Luke. The objects were in no way near the size of an F-16. At no time did I see traditional form to the matter that passed by. No wings, smoke or trailing airstreams. However, the objects were moving so fast that the gold color trailed. One other peculiarity, there was no sound at all. I live in a sleepy residential area and at 1:05 AM, I should have heard something from objects so close to the ground. Believe me, I am 42 and have never seen anything like this.  I have never seen a UFO, nor do I feel that I saw one (classical sense) tonight.  What I did see was something extraordinary.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

2nd Phoenix sighting very similar to 1997 sighting;2002-06-27 21:45:00;1 hour +;2nd Phoenix sighting very similar to 1997 sighting I witnessed the previous Phoenix sighting in 1997 and most of this sighting was in the exact same area as the last.  I live in a master planned comm. in the mountains of scottsdale and have a view of most of phoenix. I was driving home at 9:45 and noticed three very large orange lights (10x the brighteness and size a commercial plane puts out)above some cell phone towers.  I thought that a mountain was on fire.  When I got home I told my girlfriend about the fire and we went and looked and the fire was gone.  A minute later 2 fires started back up followed by a 3rd.  They were on for a couple of minutes and then quickly flickered out (they same quick flicker from a rotating movement, which we would later figure out.)  Another minute later the 3 lights (obviously not a fire anymore) appeared much higher.  We got binoculars out and verified that in fact there was no mountain where these lights were.  We observed this flickering and moving for another 15-20 minutes.  During this time they moved behind a notable landmark, Camelback Mountain and hovered there for at least five minutes. In looking through binoculuars, it looked like we could see a shadow, approx 10-15x the size of a 747 behind each light.  When the lights flickered out, we could somewhat make out that the shadow was rotating. We decided to get in the car and drive to a higher vantage point within the community.  We were there for approx 25-30 minutes. During this time, we observed that air traffic over phx had come to a standstill. Sky Harbor Int'l Airport is one of the busiest in the country and at that time of night multiple planes can be seen in approach pattern.  For 10-15 minutes while were at this location, we observed no planes and no bright lights.  For Phoenix, this is totally improbable.  Then all of the sudden the sky filled with planes. These planes had weird lights, a triangle shape, and moved extremely fast w/o making any noise.  they appeared to be patrolling the skys and playing cat and mouse with bright lights that appeared and disappeared. A bright light appeared directly overhead and then disappeared as a triangle object that resembled a stealth fighter appeared behind it. We left the area and went home because we were frightened.  Once arriving at home (2 minute drive) we went back outside and the sky looked normal (planes in the air and landing). We did not call any of the local news because we felt for sure there would be many witnesses and footage.  As of 12:00 PM Phoenix time 6/28 there has been no mention of this.

At first, we thought it was an airplane or something, but airplanes don't have lights like that.  It was moving south very slowly and would get dim and then bright again until it eventually disappeared. This sighting really started to get us curious as to what it was because the week of christmas three of us saw a similar object coming from the same direction and was moving at the same pace. This object however was a fireball because when it got almost right over us something that appeared to be embers fell from it shortly before it burned out or disappeared.

As I walked into the park next to my house, looking directly north from 40th street/Greenway Rd where I live, I saw what at first glance I thought was a shooting star.  Then I realized how big it was, how low it was in the sky. It had quite a long streaming tail which appeared gaseous.  The trail was fairly long, about 3x the diameter of the main object. The main object, at arms length I would say was the size of a nickel. It looked exactly like a comet.  It was reddish in color.  It was moving from East to West, horizontal to the ground although it looked like it was going to come down.  It did not move in any erratic patterns. I ran towards it but lost view of it behind trees.  Once I realized there was no impact...I pretty much ruled out that it was a meteor.  I did see a private jet flying into Scottsdale airport at that exact moment. The pilot of the jet had to have seen it.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

I went to my balcony and saw the four red lights in the sky. they were positioned in a line except that two were clustered together. we watched them for another 7-10 minutes and the top single light began to flicker and then faded out. following that, the two clustered lights also began to flicker and fade out. the final light lasted the longest and did fade out. during this time, i called 911 to tell them about, and the operator said that there have been no calls received around my area, maybe they are military flairs. the closest military base in at least 50 miles from where i live. my neighbor tried taking a picture of it, but nothing came out. my other neighbor has this event on video. what was very noiceable was how high they were in the sky. airplanes were flying below them. i say the lights were at least 1/4 of the total distance higher than the airplanes.

The objects initially looked like meteors as they appeared one after the other and left a trail of sparks in a streak.  When the first object stopped emitting sparks, it changed direction, and then the other object did the same thing.  Both objects then started changing direction numerous times, occasionally emitting sparks.  On a couple of occasions, the objects appeared to hover briefly before moving again.  The objects first appeared overhead moving west to east and appeared to be moving at a very high speed.  After about two minutes of high speed travel, both objects traveled beyond view.  The estimated distance traveled was well over the Phoenix metro area.  Neither object made a sound and no chase vehicles were observed.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Multiple maneuvering fireballs.;2014-09-20 20:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple maneuvering fireballs. Started with a single fireball flying horizontally (thought it was a plane on fire).  Primary fireball dropped what appeared to be a white orb much smaller than initial, then another two.  Orbs dropped away from primary, then became fireballs.   Fireballs flew in patterns, one did a loop-d-loop.  One of the secondary orbs dropped a new white orb, which after ~2 seconds of dropping became a fireball.  Primary fireball extinguished, became a blinking blue/red light flying horizontally left, then right over other fireballs.  All fireballs eventually descended below treeline.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Fireball in the SW Phoenix Sky 9/4/2015 6:45pm, or was it?;2015-09-04 18:45:00;90 seconds;Fireball in the SW Phoenix Sky 9/4/2015 6:45pm, or was it? It was still daylight and clear in the SW corner of the sky.  I went outside to let my dogs out. I was standing in the covered porch and I saw a huge red object rising on the other side of my neighbors tree.  I saw the object through the tree branches.   I stepped out into the pool area moving across my decking so I could see the object with out the tree.  I was rising higher than the tree tops.  I thought it was coming from the airport.  It appeared as a fireball, it was not a plane.  I watch the planes fly over all the time.   As I watched a huge chunk of flame fell off and went towards the ground.  It burnt up and was no longer visible.  Then a smaller portion broke off and did the same thing as the first larger piece.  The size of the fireball did not appear to change even though two pieces had fallen off.   The fireball rose higher then completely disappeared.  It did not fall to the ground, it simply disappeared.  I logically thought it was a plane crash.  There was a plane from Sky Harbor that was heading opposite of SW and was climbing into the clouds.  This was absolutely a plane.  A pilot would have been able to see the object from their cockpit.   I called a local news company and there were no sightings or reports.  This was not a meteor, or a shooting star.  Those items are very easy to distinguish and identify.  Has anyone else seen the object this evening?  If so what was it?   My cell phone was in the house.  If I'd gone to get it I would have missed the display. A cell camera would not have given a good photo, the object was not near enough, it would have just looked like a light rather than a fireball.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Looked almost like a fire in the sky.  The first object appeared then traveled SE in direction.  Folliwed by a secind that just appeared from nowhere.  At one point they stopped and just stayed there illuminating the sky.  However these objects had no blinking lights like aircraft do. Also just to ket you know there was plenty of planes that were in the area.  Around the Deer Valley Airport to be specific.  Now I know other aircraft spotted these objects and I know for certain the tower had recieved radio contact from many of the planes.  In regards to what was in the sky they were seeing?  Clear as the night sky these objects vanished.  But not because they had gotton further away.  Vanished like looking at them very clear in the sky.  To dimming out and disappearing completely.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Bright Orange-Red Glowing Objects crossing the Phoenix Sky on Several ocassions.;2018-11-22 20:51:00;20 minutes;Bright Orange-Red Glowing Objects crossing the Phoenix Sky on Several ocassions. On or about 20:51 of November 22, 2018, my girlfriend and I witnessed several fireball looking objects crossing the sky south of Phoenix, then again on November 24th at about the same time and finally a third siting on 12/15/18, around 21:30.   Looking towards the south on the first siting, they were moving north north-east, second siting moving from the south moving north north-west and the final siting from the south moving north north-east again.  They appeared to be bright orange-red glowing objects, fireballs.  They didn't appear to be bright red in the videos I will be submitting, but they were with the naked eye, bright red-orange fireball looking objects usually following the same trajectory each night.  Sometimes just one visible, at other times, several at one time at an unknown distance apart in the sky.  I live in Arcadia, a suburb in east phoenix, with a view of southern sky.  They were moving at a speed consistant with airliners that I see departing Phoenix international airport.  They crossed the entire view of the southern sky to the east and west of my house to where I had to look north to see them disappear.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Meteor-like objects with a mind of their own.;2019-07-05 20:50:00;3:00;Meteor-like objects with a mind of their own. Around 8:50-8:55 there were LOTS of lights falling from the sky. I was driving with my fiancé from Cottonwood to Mesa, and I believe I was on the 101, traveling south, somewhere between the 51, and the 202. I noticed the first, and brightest, of all of the objects, and quickly woke my fiancé so that he could see it as well. At first, it looked like a huge falling star/firework (bright flaming rock with a sparkling tail), but it lasted a really long time (around 20 seconds), and it’s flight pattern was weird. It was falling straight down for about 6 seconds, then shot right back up (2-3 seconds), fell down again in a zigzag pattern (2-3 seconds), shot straight up again (2-3 seconds), then made a hard right turn in the middle of the sky and travelled a little ways (about 3-4 seconds) before burning out. I told my fiancé to grab his phone and start filming, and he tried but said that the camera wasn’t picking them up very well, but I kept insisting that he try. Seconds after the first light disappeared, it was followed by another similar light that originated out of nowhere, high in the sky, but must have been at least 3 miles apart as the crow flies. Then another one appeared in the opposite direction.  Then another miles apart, and so on. No rhyme or reason to where they appeared.  There must have been at least six of these lights  back to back, and all popping up in random places, miles apart. . Meanwhile, there were LOTS of planes/jets that looked like they were circling the area. At first (for a very brief second), I was thinking that maybe they were some sort of flare… but flares last for a while (about 5-10 minutes), and hover in one place before burning out. I’ve seen plenty of flares from the Gila Bend Air Force while living in Ajo, and those flares are completely different than the lights that we saw.  Even the colors differ. The last one was really strange. It dropped down SUPER low (about fifty feet above some houses), and then, before hitting the ground, it leveled out, turned right, and coasted above the houses for a few seconds until it fizzled out. That would have been the perfect one to catch on camera, but unfortunately, when my fiancé tried to view the video afterwards, he realized he hadn’t been filming whatsoever. I did some research, and there were similar reports in Florida the day before, and they were saying that it could possibly be remnants of a Chinese rocket…  But since when did remnants have a mind of their own and move up, down, and sideways?
