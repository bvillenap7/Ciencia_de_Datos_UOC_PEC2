I dropped the truck tailgate down and sat on it looking westward enjoying the quiet clear night before heading inside for good. I was just basically staring straight ahead across the road over miles of vacant land and not up into the sky.  Not too long a time went by when I spotted an object moving toward me from a mile or so away.  It was traveling parallel to the ground and not more than a few hundred feet above the ground.  It got larger, naturally, as it came closer to me.  (It did not change size. It was just getting nearer and nearer.)  I hopped down off the tailgate and stood watching it get closer and closer.  I was definitely not expecting to see what I saw. This object was clear like crystal glass and spherical.  It looked like a crystalline golf ball in that its entire surface had concave circular “divets“all over it just like a golf ball.  I could see inside a black structure spanning about the center third of the sphere. The top of this black structure was probably a bit more than half the internal height of the sphere. Below the black structure was a brown structure that touched the black structure and was the same width.  It is hard to estimate the size of the sphere.  This was no star pinprick of a light in the sky.  This was probably a minimum of twenty feet in diameter and just a few hundred feet above me. I slowly raised my head up as it passed and turned my body around to follow it towards the city of Phoenix.  This sphere made not a bit of noise, and it did not cause any air turbulence.   There was no harsh or bright light emanating from it.  The inside was illuminated, (that is how I saw the black and brown structures) but no bright spot that would indicate the source of light was evident.  The outside had like a hazy light around the sphere. No separate exterior light(s), but light that must have passed from inside the crystal sphere to the outside.  It was like the haze you see around a street light at night. My eyes followed it until I could see it not more.  I ran inside and turned on the radio…no news flash, etc.  My husband was watching  tv, and there was nothing on the tv about the object. I never heard anything about it. I have looked on the internet concerning spherical ufos and have found nothing similar to what I saw.  I came across this site tonight, hesitated, but then thought maybe someone else did see it  or one like it and hadn’t responded either. It was real, and makes me wonder what our government really has knowledge/ability to do.  I know what I saw, and there will never be an denying it. I am 67 now and saw this when about 32 years old.  I was a school teacher at the time and just retired two years ago from 25 years of teaching mainly science at a Texas junior high/middle school. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I was trying to fix the event time on a report I just sent in and clicked on what ended up getting me to your home page.  I couldn't find a way back to the report to try to fix it again. The event time should have been 20:30.  It was about 8:30 at night, and I think I converted the event time incorrectly.  Sorry.

Sighting & Possible abduction;1983-06-15 19:30:00;5 Minutes;Sighting & Possible abduction Hi, I live in Phoenix Arizona. Here is the accounts of my life since the first sighting. First Sighting: In 1983 or 84 I was at my house at 36th Street and Lupine. We were the back house in a very dark culdisac. It was very dark there and easy to watch the night skies. My stepsister and I noticed three stars above the McDowell Mountains just east of Scottsdale Airport that appeared to be moving very slightly. I don't know how high up they were but it was high. We discussed how they couldn't be helicopters because there wasn't any sound from the blades. We also discussed that they couldn't be planes because the were staying in one spot. They were in a triangle type formation. They looked to be teetering or swaying weightlessly. When we noticed this we immediatly knew we were looking at something very different. They hovered above us silently for about two minutes. Then one of them shot off to the south like a bullet and it was gone. These were the fastest things I have ever seen to this day. The other two hovered a while longer and then one zipped off into the east. The one that remained hovered for about 30 seconds and then it went straight up until we could no longer see it. We were overwhelmed at what we witnessed. You just know when you see something like that what it is and you know inside what you have seen, it's like they connect with you somehow. We later watched the news and saw reports of people calling in seeing what we had seen. My life forever changed after that night. I began to have feelings of insight or intuition as I call it. The night of my time loss: I was at a party in the desert with some freinds and it was getting late so decided that it was time to leave. Nobody would give me a ride back into town so I started to walk. I walked a distance about half way to town and I noticed the sky above me began to pulse an intense blue flashing strobe and I don't remember anything after that or losing any time but that 30 minute walk took 2 hours longer than it should have. I know I lost about two t! o three hours and arrived just outside of town, how did I walked that far without knowing it. That was a very scary night. I began to get migrains after that night that hurt so bad I would almost pass out and vomit. I had never even had a headache before that night. It's all very strange and confusing. I have predicted things like putting on my seatbelt 10 seconds before my wife and I were involved in an accident, I had a feeling something was about to happen and put on the seatbelt real fast and the next thing I know we were involved in a pretty serious accident. I was with a freind at a late night movie asked him for some strange reason to look up at the lights and at that exact moment the entire parking lights(about 50) all shut off at that second. Even I was freaked out by this, I don't know why I asked him to look at them, I just did and that still trips me out. There are many more occassions where these types of things happened to me.  Recently we were at Lord of the Rings Two Towers and I had a feeling something was wrong at home, I leaned over during the movie and I asked my wife if she left the Christmas lights on at home because it was a three hour movie, I was sensing or worrying about fire. When we arrived at  home I found a candle my step-daughter had left burning on her desk shelf and it was starting to burn the shelf above, my wife was amazed by this! It might seem trivial, but something as simple as driving someplace, feeling when to leave with my intuition and I experience no traffic and make it through every green light. Does anyone else experience these types of things? I was able to start putting computers together without any knowledge of them. I automatically knew how they worked and I instantly knew how to build them. There are many more things I have experienced but it would take all day to write them down, and I feel very strange writing about this. It feels better to finally get this off my chest. Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in June 1983, assuming that it may have been summertime that the witness would have been walking a long distance at night.  Optic migraine headaches can be preceded by the occurrence of flashing blue triangles in the visual field, but we have no way of knowing whether that may have been the cause of the witness's experience.

Trip to Pheonix Mountains result in Sphere shaped object Sighting.;1985-07-15 13:00:00;10;Trip to Pheonix Mountains result in Sphere shaped object Sighting. I was on one of the mountains overlooking the city of Pheonix, when I spotted several silver spheres in a group going through the mountain peaks. I was only a kid then and no one could explain what they were. They seemed pretty big because at the distance the peaks were at and the distance we were at was pretty far, and they were still the size of a car.

The silence of the passing of the object is what struck me the most. The object was a BRIGHT round white glowing sphere with no other observable lights or colors.  Estimated altitude was about 1000 to 1500 feet making the object about twenty feet in diameter.  There was no engine noise as the object sped from east to west overhead in a straight trajectory.  This would have put the object just over E. Bethany Home Road (Phoenix, AZ) as it headed west. I had contacted the Phoenix PD and the dispatcher’s words were:  I’m not sure what you saw but I’ve been getting calls from all over the city about it.   Luke AFB had no comment. A little about me:  I’m ex-military and was a jumper for the Army Parachute in West Germany in the early 80’s and had jumped from and flew in a number of aircraft through the years.  This wasn’t ours! ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

This is from an interview I had  on 5/28/99.... 5/28/99 Phoenix, Arizona -- At 10 AM on Friday, May 7, 1999, 48-year-old man was experimenting with his new Kodak DC-200 digital camera in front of his Phoenix, Arizona home. He was puzzled by the number of contrails, some in X-shapes, and aimed the camera sequentially moving around the sky. He did not realize until he went to his computer to download the digital images that he had captured unidentified aerial craft in one frame identified as Dcp00102, shown below. The frame Dcp00101 which preceded it by only a couple of seconds is also shown below. Not only are the objects unidentified, but there is another mystery: why aren't the objects visible in frame Dcp00101? Here is the man, a Phoenix salesman, describing his first hand experience that morning: Phoenix, Arizona: I've been kind of interested in the contrails and been taking pictures of them for the last several months. And so, I looked up into the sky and the sky was just full of contrails that morning, including an X which - I've seen a lot of contrails up there, but not an X every single time. So, I was taking pictures starting from the north and then turning clockwise and I probably took about six to eight pictures and wound up kind of facing to the south, southwest, with my last picture. And about an hour later, I went to the computer and downloaded them into the computer and I was looking at them to see if there was anything I would like to put on my web page. I've put most of the of the contrails I've taken on my web page. As I went through them starting with the first picture heading towards the last picture, they were pretty much typical with the contrail in there and what I had expected to be seeing. And then I got to the last picture, or next to last (turns out it was last), and I saw something in that picture and it was definitely unexpected. WHAT DID YOU SEE? When I first looked at this, it looked almost like a round, metallic ball in the sky. I kind of focused in over the roof of my next door neighbor's house and just outside one of the clouds up there and fairly close to one of the contrails, there was this round, metallic, ball-looking thing. And then right next to that, fairly close to it, there was a dark spot on the film. And as I zoomed in on it, I could still see what appeared to be kind of a round metallic object up there, but then the two dark spots - or actually, the dark spot - looked like TWO dark spots. It looked to me as if it could be a couple of military jets. They were dark in color whatever they were. They were kind of in the shape of an aircraft. AND IN YOUR PHOTO WHICH I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE QUITE CLOSE. AND WHAT PUZZLES ME - YOU WERE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS WITH THIS NEW CAMERA, SO YOU WERE CONCENTRATING ON THE NEW CAMERA. BUT DID YOU NOT HEAR THE SOUND OF JETS? No. no. One other thing I was going to mention - there was another photo I took, I think it was the one just before this that has that same cloud in it. It's just slightly moved from that location. But, in that picture there was nothing other than that same cloud. You could see the form of it. You can tell it's the same cloud. AND WHAT TIME PERIOD DO YOU THINK IS BETWEEN THE TWO PHOTOS? Oh, it was just a couple of seconds. About the time it takes for the camera to regenerate to the next shot. I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO SHOW THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE SECOND PHOTOGRAPH DID NOT SEEM TO BE IN THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPH TWO SECONDS BEFORE. Right. AND THAT WOULD MAKE BOTH OBJECTS, THE BLACK AND THE ROUND OBJECT, ANOMALOUS. Yes. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING ANOMALOUS IN THE SKIES BEFORE THIS PHOTOGRAPH ON MAY 7TH OF THESE UNUSUAL OBJECTS IN THE CONTRAILS? PHOENIX LIGHTS, March 13, 1997: Well, yes, as a matter of fact on March 13, 1997, when what came through here they are now calling the Phoenix Lights. I was a witness to that also. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. OK. I was going to a friend's house. It was just a little after dark, probably somewhere between 8 and 8:30 in the evening. So, it was fairly dark out at that time of year. And I pulled up in front of his house and was just turning the car off, just about to get out and I looked out my driver's side window and I saw four lights in the sky. Maybe about 3,000 to 4,000 feet up in the air. And they were just huge, bright lights. They appeared to be maybe a couple of miles from where I was. But what was unusual about it was that they were in the shape of a diamond - like with one light at the top and one at each side and one at the bottom. So, I kept looking trying to figure out, 'What is this?' Because I had never seen anything like this before. And I noticed they were coming straight down out of the sky. They were all coming down at the same time, so it wasn't like they were individual objects. They appeared to be all moving at the same rate of speed which was actually fairly slow. LIKE FOUR LIGHTS ON SOME SORT OF A LARGE OBJECT THAT WAS THE SHAPE OF A DIAMOND? Right. OR AT LEAST THE LIGHTS WERE IN THE CONFIGURATION OF A DIAMOND ON A LARGE OBJECT? Right. More like that actually. And so I was trying to figure out in my mind, 'What is this?' and what came to mind was that it might be a commercial jetliner in a nose dive headed toward the ground. But then I thought that can't be because it was moving too slow. And I just didn't know what it was. And as it continued down, I kept thinking I was going to see this gigantic ball of flames burst up when it hits the ground. Then it just kind of disappeared behind the house across the street from where I was. Then I couldn't see it any longer. Then this turned out to be the Phoenix Lights. As the story goes, they came from outside of Phoenix from the north headed down through Phoenix and kind of turned and headed out towards the Tucson area. And there's just been people all over the city and state who have seen these. And evidently, that's what I saw.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Three Bright Orange Orbs large in size;1999-10-15 21:00:00;usually 2 hours;Three Bright Orange Orbs large in size for about a couple of weeks of my last year in high school(night School), i would take some friends of mine home and i would drive a stretch of road called pecos road. pecos road backs up to an indian reservation so its basically all desert and theres no houses for miles. while driving we saw some unusual lights about 5 miles away in the desert, there would be about 3 of them at one time. they disapear and reappear for almost an hour. they had an almost orange hologram appearance that was very bright and the craft looked like it was alive in a way. these sightings went on for a week until we decided to go closer to the ufos. one night after school we saw the lights again. myself and 3 of my friends stopped at my house to get some firearms and we headed of in my car and went about 5-10 miles in the desert at a very high speed trying to get to the craft(they were about 7 miles away once we reached the desert). about 2 miles away from the ufo's we noticed a cow dung smell in the air? and when we got closer to the craft it indeed had a brilliant almost florescent orange color to it that looked to be moving on the outside of the craft.when we got closer to the craft it would disapear and not even a second later it reappeared about 3 miles farther away. we gave up going after the ufo a short time after that and returned home, but the next night i was armed with a video camera and i filmed the ufos from about 5 miles away. so i do have video and would love to share it, maybe someone else has video of the same ufos out there. my friends mother also witnessed the crafts and she talked to some military type people(i think theres a proving ground near that area) and she was told that the lights were just flares. from what i saw and from what i have on tape, these are clearly NOT flares. Please email me back dont call unless you provide me with a number, i want you to see this footage. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD));33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

At about 7:12 PM arizona time I saw in the southern sky a light coming over the indian reservation from my back yard. At first I thought they were search lights coming from a casino that the indians run but as it got closer it was two faint balls of light. As one ball was rotating down the other was rotating up. They were very faint but larger in diameter. It came from the south and was heading north north west across the sky. I have seen alot in the sky out here and all was able to be explained. I would love to hear that this was no big deal because I do not as of tonight, beleive in UFO's. There was no noise coming from this object, and it had to be in the atmosphere. I called a friend who is a pilot for America West and he is going to call his friends at Sky Harbour airport to see if anyone else saw what I saw. At about 8:00pm my wife and sister in law saw several aircraft above out house circling as if they were looking for something.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Third sighting this week:  Saw two orange orbs (non-moving and silent) in sky over southwest Phoenix.;2004-06-17 22:00:00;10 minutes;Third sighting this week:  Saw two orange orbs (non-moving and silent) in sky over southwest Phoenix. I guess I'm more likely to see a UFO considering I've seen them three times this week and cannot quit looking at the sky at night now!  :)  Better odds, I'm going to have a car accident if I don't watch it.  Back to what I saw:  I was on my way home from a movie at Desert Ridge in Phoenix with three of my friends.  We had talked about my sightings from earlier in the week and even had a good laugh about them.  I couldn't help looking at the sky when I noticed the lights were there again.  This time there were two orbs.  My friend who was driving exited 101 at Scottsdale Road and proceeded south.  We made a right turn at the first street (Mayo) and headed west and stopped 1/4 mile down to watch the lights.  They were blinking on and off just as they had done two nights previous.  There was also another car pulled over just a little further down the street and the driver was standing outside of his car watching them too.  I noted the time immediately when I saw the lights (10:00 p.m.).  The show lasted for about 10 minutes.  This time I took a picture with my cell phone.  The resolution is terrible but it did capture the objects as well as some planes that were in the area.  Interestingly though the color of the objects is not orange in the photo.  One is brown and the other is green.  During the 10 minutes, the planes appear to fly above, below and all around them, going about their business as if it's nothing unusual.  I just don't understand why the pilots don't report these lights.  Are they not seeing them?  In reading the reports in the database, there appear to be a high number in the southwest sky that are very similar over Phoenix.  With all the cameras around recording our every move these days, why do we not have one focused on the sky to capture this phenomenon in Phoenix?  I'm really curious now as to the origin of these lights.  I've purchased a compass that I'm keeping in my car to provide better details.  At least my friends saw it this time.  I will see if I can get them to submit their report as well.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Small sphere, moving very fast to the west, directly under my aircraft, 3,500 feet;2005-05-08 11:00:00;10 seconds;Small sphere, moving very fast to the west, directly under my aircraft, 3,500 feet Flying alone in a private aircraft, I was inbound to Phoenix, approaching from the southwest, just south of South Mountain, at the eastern tip of the mountain range.  I was at 3500 feet.   Something approached the plane -- I got a sense of speed before a sense of it's shape -- from the right front quarter.  It darted right under the plane, I would say at about 15 to twenty feet below me.   At first I thought it might be a bird, and was alarmed.  A bird strike, even in a small plane, could do some serious damage.   I quickly looked to my left and saw the object.  It was a sphere, about the size of a large softball, or maybe a bit smaller than a basketball.  It was pale yellow in color, and it was moving very fast, in a horizontal path, not diving, or climbing.  It disappeared to the west very quickly.  I lost it on the horizon.   I told myself it had to have been a bird, but no bird moves that fast.  Even with combined closing speed (I was only doing 90 knots indicated -- about 103mph) a bird would not have looked like it was going that fast.  I had to collect myself and fly the plane, I was about to enter busy airspace, so I had to think about other things.   Very strange.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
High alt.  Object over Phoenix July 29th;2005-07-29 14:00:00;20 min;High alt.  Object over Phoenix July 29th Was having smoke break outside of my work and noticed a star like object in the sky on a bright cloudless day. It was almost directly over head and moving on a heading of 180.  It appeared to be very high ( 20,000 feet or more) and left no contrail.  Moving very slow and took about 5 minutes to move about 20 feet across the sky. It then stopped and held its postion for another 5 minutes or more. I had just bought a pair of polarized sunglasses and could only see the object cleary with them on. When I removed the glasses the sky was extreamly bright and it mad it almost impossible to see the object. The object appeared to sway back and forth slightly so I steadied my head against a wall to make sure I wasnt the one doing the swaying. And it was swaying or appearing to sway from the heat rising or atmospheric conditions. It then moved on a heading of 270 slowly and I watched it for a bit longer then was forced to go back to work. I have been searching the net looking for other reports of it. But due to its  unimpressive movements and subdued lighting maybe I am 1 in 3 million but I doubt it. My Friend also saw it but then shrugged his shoulders and went back into work.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
2 Women Witness Falling green shere in Phoenix @ 2AM on Dunlap Avenue unusually desolate;2006-01-07 02:25:00;4 seconds;2 Women Witness Falling green shere in Phoenix @ 2AM on Dunlap Avenue unusually desolate My girlfriend & I were driving to her house via Dunlap Avenue going West.  Just before approaching 15th Avenue, I had shifted my position looking up and Northwest. My girlfriend had noticed this, and was wondering What the hell is she looking for?  It was at this moment that both of us witnessed a green sphere falling (shooting?) downwards.  It had appeared approximately 30 feet above us and looked like it was going to crash into one of the houses in that area.  However, there was no sound and, although anticipating some kind of explosion and/or fire, one never appeared.  We had also noticed that there were no other cars passing, nor were there any homeless people out... We were definitely the only ones to witness this from our angle/location.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Ball of light;2006-06-06 21:00:00;3 minutes;I was standing in my front yard smoking a ciggarette just looking at the stars, when I noticed a bright white sphere moving slowly across the sky north to south. Now at the same time there is a 747 flying east to west heading for sky harbor airport, I could see the headlights and the blinking lights on the plane. The white sphere had no blinking lights what so ever it was soild white and was alot brighter than the headlights on plane. I continued to watch as they crossed pathes with each other, I was not able to tell if they were at the same altitued because the sphere was just in fornt of plane. As the plane went past me I couldn't see the headlights any more but I could still see the bright sphere as if it was a ball of light. The object continued flying south into some thin clouds. When it got into the clouds they lit up all around it. Then it got into a thick cloud and I couldn't see it anymore , I stood there for a few more minutes waiting for it to come out the other side of the cloud, and it never did.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Three spheres flying high on the skies of Phoenix, Arizona;2006-11-18 15:10:00;3 minutes;Three spheres flying high on the skies of Phoenix, Arizona After buying some refreshments for lunch, my wife, daughter and I decided to go to the park to have a family time under the shades of the trees.  We took a blanket with us to spread it on the grass.  There was a lot of people at the park, and we opted for a tree apart from the rest of the people.  After having lunch we laid on the blanket facing the blue clear sky.  I started scanning the sky for airplanes, and I noticed a small sphere way up there, too high, for a minute I thought it was a balloon however, as I saw airplanes flying by, I noticed that the sphere was much higher than the airplanes.  The size of the airplanes was tiny, and I could still see the sphere, so it could not be a balloon.  The sphere was stationary for a minute then it started moving slowly North in a straight line, I told my wife about it and she was able to see it too... she said The air up there is dragging the balloon however, after several seconds, the sphere reversed direction, now going South slowly.  I told her about it and she said Well the air changed course up there.  As I kept looking the sphere going South, I noticed another sphere positioned much higher, my wife wasn't able to see it.  And I started to get excited, Those are not balloons I told her.  The sphere going south reversed direction again, and this time it moved faster Northbound, as it was moving I look farther ahead of it and I could see another sphere at the same speed ahead of the firt one and I lost them in a couple of seconds.  I turn my eyes back looking for the sphere that I had noticed on a higher altitude, and I noticed that the sphere had come down because I could see it better. My wife was able to see it too.  I grabbed my digital camera and took a picture, when I moved the camera away the sphere was gone, when I got home and downloaded the picture, I only could see the blue sky.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
THIS IS A MULTI EVENT REPORT, OF EVENTS HAPPENING WITHIN THE LAST TWO MONTHS... After my report on November 18, 2007, of three spheres;2006-11-19 13:15:00;10 Minutes;THIS IS A MULTI EVENT REPORT, OF EVENTS HAPPENING WITHIN THE LAST TWO MONTHS... After my report on November 18, 2007, of three spheres over the Phoenix skies.  I became exited and intrigued about my coincidential UFOs sighting thus I started to keep a watchful eye more frequently on the skies.  Also, since my first sighting happened at 3pm during the day, I only watch the sky during the day not having the need to watch at night, since night observations make easier to confuse ordinary lights with UFOs. ******** SUNDAY NOVEMBER 19, 2006 ********** Still excited about the sighting on the previus day while my wife and daughter went to church, I stayed home, I went to the backyard around 1pm, at the beginning I didn't see anything, but after 10 minutes of watching, I could see a white spec to the North at 80°, after a little while it became more visible since it descended more becoming a metallic sphere, the altitude was higher than the flight of a commercial airline plane.  The sphere travelled for 3 minutes Southbound until it dissapeard and it was reflecting the sunligh in flicks giving the impression of being a rotating object... ********* THURSDAY NOVEMBER 23, 2006 ******** We went to Tucson, AZ to spend Thanksgiving with relatives... We arrived to Tucson on Wednesday night, and on Thursday around noon while the Turkey was being prepared I went outside to my relatives' backyard The house is located in South Tucson close to Irvington Road and Benson Highway... The day was a nice with some light clouds on the skies and again after watching for a while, I was facing Southwest and I saw this bright metallinc, aluminum like, sphere coming down slowly from the clouds at 60° I called my cousin's boyfriend and he put his sunglasses on and we could see the UFO flying high from Southwest to Northeast towards the Catalina mountains until it dissapeared without descending.  We could see this object for around three minutes and again, it appeared to have a rotating motion, since the sunligth w! ould ref lect on its body and flicker once in a while.  ********* SUNDAY DECEMBER 10, 2006 **********  I was in my house, located in West Phoenix, watching TV.  I could hear a helicopter's noise flying low in the neighborhood I came outside to the backyard, and noticed that the helicopter was two blocks East of my house flying in circles it was giving orders to someone on the ground thru the speakers then I turn my sight Northeast at 75° and saw this metallic sphere stationary way up there, I went inside to get my wife, but she didn't want to come out, because she's tired of me looking for UFOs when I came outside again, the spehere was not in there anymore, then I turned North-Northwest and I found it at a much lower altitude at 45°, and I definitely could appreciate an oval shape and reflecting sunlight, I ran inside the house to get a videocamera a cheap Panasonic Mini DV53, when I came outside the UFO wasn't in there anymore and the helicopter had moved four blocks south of my house and it still was flying in circles.  I look around for a while, and turned my head up 90°, and there it was right above me.  I tried to focuse it with the videocamera but it wasn't in there anymore I looked for it and I found it East at 75° and it had ascended I wasn't able to get a shot of it, but it definitely was in there I finally got tired and went back into the house The event lasted at least 10 minutes....  ********* WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 13, 2006 *********   I went to pick up my 6 years old daughter at school, she gets released at 2:40pm, I always get there 10 to 15 minutes early, and while I wait for her, I scan the skies looking for my friends, it was a nice day, sunny with a few light clouds, at 2:39pm, I noticed the metallic sphere appear East-Northeast at 75° there's always a bunch of people picking up theird kids, and I watch around to see if anyone notices what I'm watching noone is watching, I assume noone is into this, noone would care.  The UFO travelled right above us as I picked my daughter, it took ! around t wo minutes since it appeared and dissapeared on its path...  ******** SUNDAY DECEMBER 16, 2006 ********** My brother and his family came to visit, it's been over a month since I've been watching the skies looking and spotting UFOs, and he's not aware of my activity yet...  He needed some tools because he was going to do some work on his car I was on the driveway getting tools out of my car I noticed the UFO East at 80°, my brother came out, then I tell him, about some events over the last month, he scratches his hair, by now the UFO has moved farther East and it's visible at 45° over my neighbors tree. I didn't tell him about it, and then he spot it, and he asked Like that one?. I just smiled and replied to him, Yes, just like that one. ******** I must disclose that since the first sighting I've watch similar UFOs in at least 9 different times however, since the time my brother saw that one, I'm not able to see one more sighting.  Also, I've been able to find video of similar sightings...  check them and judge for yourselves....

Star like sphere in the middle of the clear blue afternoon sky....;2008-03-07 14:00:00;10 mins;Star like sphere in the middle of the clear blue afternoon sky.... I was lying by the pool in the backyard around 2:00  in the afternoon.  I saw a sphere in the northeast sky hovering in one place.  It looked like a star in the bright blue sky.  I watched as this sphere changed shape and morphed into two spheres.  One moved to the right and then rejoined the original one.  My friend was with me and witnessed this event also.  I grabbed my camera and shot these photos – if you zoom in you can see the sphere (definitely not a star or any other type of aircraft that I know of) and in the last photo you can see the faint outline of the second sphere. Since this sighting, I was again in my backyard (in May) with a friend and we saw the same sphere, but, this time it moved at a very rapid speed from south to north and, as it moved, a small strobe-like light shot out from the side and moved away to the east.  As the sphere approached the same location as the last time I had seen it, it stopped abruptly, another sphere appeared and flew off very fast to the north.  The original one hovered there for some minutes and then just faded away. The feeling I get after having witnessed is frustration at not knowing what the hell I’m looking at.  I hope we all find out something soon.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

Bright sphere in clear, blue sky;2008-06-13 13:00:00;15 minutes;Bright sphere in clear, blue sky My friend and I were in the back yard sitting by the pool when I looked up into the bright clear blue sky and noticed what looked like a star.  I kept watching it and it just hovered there for a long time, kind of changing shapes although it was so high it was really hard to tell.  It looked like it split into two and one moved over to the right of it and then went back and rejoined the first.  I got my camera and took photos, which I will email to you.  Please look at them and tell me what you think.  If you zoom in on the object you can tell it is clearly not a star, and it wasn't moving so it wasn't a plane or helicopter or balloon.  On the fourth picture I took you can see the object separating on the bottom.   After 15 minutes or so, hard to tell, I was so entranced, it just faded away and I could no longer see  anything in the sky.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

3 orange orbs at 99th ave and Glendale.;2008-11-08 18:30:00;5 minutes;3 orange orbs at 99th ave and Glendale This sighting occurred in Phoenix, AZ, in the fall of 2008.   My husband and I were traveling south on the west side 101 Freeway at Glendale Avenue.  There is a large building on 99th Avenue south of Glendale Avenue.  It was dusk outside and the sun had just set behind the White Tank Mountains.  My husband pointed out the building with 3 large orange/red orbs stacked over the top of the building.  They were glowing and my husband asked if there were any airplanes that fly over that building because it looked like one of those large poles with lights on it that warn airplanes. Glendale airport it just north of this area, but this building is right next to the 101 freeway and no planes would be flying that close and low over the freeway.  I was trying to get my phone on to take pictures, when the lights starting glowing even brighter and getting larger and as we watched they just disappeared. My husband got off the freeway and we drove over to the building to see if there was a light pole in the property or even close to it.  There was none.  It was completely dark by then and we went up 99th avenue and got back on the 101 freeway, southbound again.  The orbs were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary time.

It reflected the light from the sun and was gone with nighfall. There was either a 2nd above Sedona, AZ or it moved.  The Federal Aviation Administration said the object appears to be a balloon. It was not showing up on FAA radar, which Gregor said could mean it is a small, non-metallic object.

Flashing moving lights over Phoenix AZ;2009-08-16 21:00:00;one hour;Flashing moving lights over Phoenix AZ I was looking through binoculars at Jupiter when flashing red and blue lights went across my field of vision.  I followed it to the north and it stopped, changed to pink and moved in the opposite direction.  Then I saw another flashing red, white and blue light . I lay down on my chaise lounge and looked up with my binoculars and saw what appeared to be a fuzzy white type of sphere much larger than the lights or stars move from east to west and then it suddenly started flashing the red , blue and white lights right in front of my eyes.  I called out my fiancee’ who also watched these lights move from one area of the sky to another, mostly in the south now.  My son came home and watched with us and we all saw two of the strange lights follow an airplane heading southwest—same direction.  At first I thought maybe it was President Obama’s plane with escorts or something, but he spent the night here, so it wasn’t that. The lights moved erratically faster, slower, up or down not in a straight line like an airplane.  I saw many airplanes and could distinguish the difference.  When the flashing occurred you could not see a shape, like I did when it was not flashing. There were many of these throughout the hour in different locations, and they just disappeared after 10 pm. My son saw groups of these lights in the early morning hours of August 16 around 2 am.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

A metallic sphere seen below the airplane while taking off from the Phoenix airport on a commercial flight.;2012-05-08 13:50:00;10 seconds;A metallic sphere seen below the airplane while taking off from the Phoenix airport on a commercial flight. I wanted to share my experience with an online community other than friends.  I'm a frequent airline traveler, always at a window seat.  About a minute after take-off from Phoenix airport, about 1500 ft AGL, I was looking out the window and saw a perfectly round, metallic(shiny) sphere below our plane, moving perpendicular to our flight path.  The sphere was possibly 500 feet below and moving probably close to our speed.  It was hard to figure out the size, but it was moving quickly and in a perfectly straight line.  This was not like any aircraft that I've ever seen in the sky or have heard about.  Basically a large shiny ball bearing soaring through the sky.  No trails or hazes...  It was a perfectly sunny day with no clouds and calm sky's.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

No such lights have ever been present in this neighborhood as I work in a business only six blocks from where I saw these lights.  The lights from a distant seemed stranded together but upon arriving for a view under each light each object was separate from the others. Each shape (kind of oval) was uniformed throughout.  Each had a different altitude(some higher some lower)from one another. And each craft had two oscilating, dull lights on the their underside.  To be honest, they looked like candles flickering and masked inside a pumpkin except that there were no openings but rather light that was diffused as being filtered/masked as if inside a lamp shade or parachute material.  Never have seen such a spectacle in the sky like this.  Thought I heard a jet engine but the traffic was heavy and! I couldn't be certain given the roar of the street traffic. Were residents spoofed for a Halloween trick here in Phoenix?   I haven't found any information on this loose formation of lights that flew through Phoenix tonight.  The event was just bizzar.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755

It was about as bright as say, maybe 1/5th of a full Moon-or brighter than any star in the Big or Little Dipper, say. It made a semicircle almost overhead, then went SE towards the City of Tempe, then vanished in the clouds. It would make 3 graduatingly brighter flashes, then dim-down again, while in flight.  I did attempt to photograph it, but my celphone couldn't catch it due to the general lighting of the area.  I am a trained observer.  I've been a security officer, at least P/T for almost 34 years.

The airplane was moving from west to east as it positioned for final approach, coming in over North Phoenix along Shea Boulevard.  We were low, in the 2,000 foot range.  Watching out the window, I see what I assume to be an executive jet heading toward us.  It is noticeably close so I pay more attention.  As we pass by each other, I am surprised to see that there are no wings and no fuselage. It is a sphere gray and reflective.  It was a stunningly odd site to watch a sphere pass us by.  I fly a lot and know what an aircraft or balloon looks like.  This was a sphere it may have been 10 – 15 feet in diameter and was traveling east to west.

Point of light or bright object in the daytime sky.;2014-04-11 15:05:00;15-20 minutes;Point of light or bright object in the daytime sky. I was outside of Chick-Fil-A eating in the parking lot.  I saw a point of light pretty high in there NE sky probably at a 45 degrees angle up.  It was stationary for some time, at least 5 minutes, but then I noticed slow movement towards the East.   After a minute or so it then seemed to descend somewhat in a southeasterly direction and was getting slightly larger which made me realize it was getting closer.   Then it slowed and switched directions and headed north.  I noticed that it was very visible with polarized sunglass but barely visible without.  It started moving north and ascending in altitude.   At that point I got out of my car and approached someone leaving the diner and asked them if they could see it.  He could not see anything but I could see it with my polarized glasses.   I took two photos.  I deleted the first as I noticed my iPhone camera could not detect the object.  The second one I kept to bring home and see if could indeed pull it out with some enhan! cement.  I was able to actually see a faint point of light in the photograph.   The object must have been highly reflective being that I couldn't spot it hardly at all until I viewed it through polarized lenses.   Eventually the object seemed to accelerate slight and slowly vanished out of sight heading due north.

Eventually moving away in upward and south direction . I was in the front yard, time was 3:00 pm.  I was looking at the trees in the yard, when this light caught my attention.  It stayed in one position for approximately six minutes, I could see what looked like a shaded (dark) area at the lower portion of the sphere.  The object appears to pulsate the light it was giving off. At this point in time, I went into my house and brought out my digital camera and took a few shots.  Then I noticed an airplain from Scottsdale airport fly from east to west underneath the object, bringing to mind that it was farther above and away from my location than I originally thought it to be.  A little later it moved upward and south and disappeared.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
UFO sighting over Phoenix.;2017-05-19 13:38:00;2 hours;UFO sighting over Phoenix I had gone out back for some fresh air and happened to look up.  The corner of the solar panel was blocking the sun and I saw multiple orbs glowing in the sky.  They seemed to fly in all directions and in no set pattern.  I was able to shot 15 photos and a short video of the objects.  It was a cloudless day, no breeze to speak either.  I will leave it to you dear reader (viewer) to determine exactly what they where.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Sparkling Spheres in the eastern Arizona night, tonight !;2017-11-25 20:48:00;Continuous;Sparkling Spheres in the eastern Arizona night, tonight ! 11-25-2017 at 20:45hrs.  My girlfriend was in the backyard with our dog when she noticed 2 sphere shaped objects in the eastern sky.  We live in central Phoenix close to the downtown business district.  She came inside to make me aware of the lights in the sky, as we’ve seen other before, just in different areas.  I came outside to see the spheres/circles.  They were indeed illuminating multiple colors of green, blue, red, gold, white, and lavender, much unlike a plane.  As these two spheres were perfectectly still, they were perfectly aligned between 3 vertical stars, which my girl thought might be Orion’s Belt, I begged to differ.  I don’t think she’s right.  It’s 8:56pm right now here in Phoenix, and the lights have now been there for 30 minutes.  You all should take a look in the eastern sky.  IT’S AMAZING !!!!  This is one of many sightings in Phoenix we’ve witnessed.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Over 50 UFO's Travel Across Northern Phoenix, AZ Skys Right Above Me.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-12-12 06:00:00;15 minutes;Over 50 UFO's Travel Across Northern Phoenix, AZ Skys Right Above Me I have been seeing what look like flying stars randomly for over a year between the hours of 5 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. MST.  This morning I watched 2 of them go across the sky right above me.  Soon after that I saw more and more and more coming one after the other.  They were coming from the North West and traveling South East.  They were exactly the same distance from one another following each other in a line formation.  They kept coming for over 12 minutes and I counted over 50.  They were as bright as planet and a bit smaller.  I stood up and watched this in amazement.  It was literally a fleet of UFO star like orbs.  Someone else HAD to have seen this.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
big, bright, white light appeared, moved forward, and vanished.;2020-02-28 16:45:00;3 seconds;big, bright, white light appeared, moved forward, and vanished. it appeared suddenly.  It was a bright white orb and the light of it was dense.  if i held my fingers out and closed an eye to try and squish it, it would have been around the size of a ping pong ball.  it went forward very quickly and disappeared. we don’t thing it was within our atmosphere but it definitely wasn’t a shooting star or a meteor, there was no tail and it vanished.  not behind trees or a mountain, into nowhere.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
Pulsating, sphericalm multi ringed, stationary object that I viewed for 2 plus hours.   ((Venus??));2020-04-02 20:30:00;2+ hours;Pulsating, sphericalm multi ringed, stationary object that I viewed for 2 plus hours. Looking up I saw a extremely bright star in the West (slightly North) sky. I watched it for about 10 minutes and kept my eye on the three faint stars (2 above and 1 to the right) to check if it was moving, thinking it could be a possible plane, although I knew that the constant light and brightness wouldn't be a plane.  I decided to take a video with commentary to post on my FB page to friends.  That is the first video. The second and third are video after I honed in on it and finally enlarged the sphere to the phones maximum capacity.  These video's are the result.  It was approximately two hours of observation without the object moving at all (I kept the reference stars that were near in sight). I stepped into the house for about a 1/2 hour and when I went back out, it was gone. While I was watching there were 2 different planes in the vicinity flying by. The light was extremely bright and never changed throughout my observation. To the necked eye it looked li! ke a very big star with no pulsing at all. The pulsing (and some of the people that have viewed the video said it looked like it was rotating also), was not apparent until it was enlarged.;33.5058965594848;-112.073904115755
