I was watching blinking airplane lights in the distance, when suddenly four large yellow square lights came on in sequence, then went off at the same time.   The lights were large, rectangular, and appeared to be about a mile from where I was standing and about one half the height of the passing airplanes.  They did not reappear in the 30 minutes I watched.;34.1764;-112.768
