There seemed to be from 3 to 5 lights on at one time, the one in the rear would go out and then there would be an additional one go on in front.  This happened three to four times.   Then they went out.  Then it repeated about 15 seconds later.  Then nothing. It lasted about a total of 30 seconds. No sound.;34.1764;-112.768
Orange glowing lights in the sky, 3 sets of 3 and then 2 sets of 3 in two different locations in Congress, Arizona.;2016-11-02 20:42:00;20 minutes;Orange glowing lights in the sky, 3 sets of 3, and then 2 sets of 3 in two different locations in Congress, Arizona. My mom, and her boyfriend and I were driving home from dinner. We went around the last round about heading out of town, on our way to yarnell.  This round about is the last one off the US 60 before you take the road to congress. After going round, in the sky before was 3 glowing lights.  They had an orange glow, and then looked as though shaped around something round.  Then 2 sets of three more began to appear.  It lasted maybe just a minute. We were all in shock, we knew it couldn’t be an airplane. We continued on and then on the road ahead of us for 6 minutes and we saw them again! But this time, only 2 sets of the 3.  Same orange glow. I was on the phone when they appeared again, and this time my phone lost service as they appeared.  The call dropped. They lasted maybe 30 seconds this time. Then within another few minutes, I saw them appear on the left side of the vehicle, now distant. Then didn’t see them again that night.  But as I kept watching, I saw four or five airplanes flying towards where they were.  I saw them everywhere and wondered why so many came all of the sudden.;34.1764;-112.768
