Till it moved South. It was directly South of me, moving slowly . As I looked at the nearby stars, I realized it had not been there very long , as I continually sweep the sky on clear nites like this. It was as large as Venus, but not as bright, and more yellow. It diminished in brightness to the size and brightness of a small star, and dimmed out, as it slowly headed south.;33.7292;-114.1925
