Grey basketball tracking me from the front!;2003-05-01 12:00:00;.5 hour;Grey basketball tracking me from the front! I was driving northbound between I-8 and I-10 on Arizona 95 when I noticed a spherical object that looked like a grey basketball with a few small nub like antennae. It followed me as a proceeded at approximately 65 mph only it tracked me from in front of my vehicle. It stayed in exactly the same position as I peered up through my windshield. This was shocking to me! I pulled over and got out of the car. It hung in the sky in exactly the same position relative to my car! Is I stared at it I noticed a strange high piched sound which was almost inaudible in the bright noon day sun. I was shaking as I got back in my car and drove on at a high speed. It stayed exactly in the same position (about my 10 o-clock) and off my passenger side in the desert. Finally as I crested a rise I saw Quartzsite off in the distance. I was never so glad to see Quartzsite! I suspect I was in a test-range of some sort but I had never seen anything like this! I cannot remember seeing ! the thing again and I proceeded to my destination. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.7292;-114.1925
