Perfect line of small lights (stars? Lit up by a beam moving across the night sky.   ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-25 21:20:00;2-5 minutes;Perfect line of small lights (stars? Space ships?) lit up by a beam moving across the night sky, Quartzsite Arizona I was with my boyfriend near Crystal Hill outside of Quartzsite last night.  When we got out of our vehicle to camp, he looked shocked and told me to look up at the sky.  What it looked like was a perfect line of stars moving across the sky in a straight line.  It was about 7-15 small stars in length and there was light hitting the stars illuminating only 3-4 at a time.  The perfectly straight line of stars moved slower than a meteor/ shooting star and kept moving across the sky.  It seemed faster than a satellite.  Basically it looked like mini space ships/stars following each other.  The light beam I mentioned earlier would hit a couple of groupings of the stars at a time and followed it as it when across the sky.  This happened at 9:20pm between the pan handle of the Big Dipper and Arcturus, but closer to Arcturus.  It went in between these and kept going in a straight line.
