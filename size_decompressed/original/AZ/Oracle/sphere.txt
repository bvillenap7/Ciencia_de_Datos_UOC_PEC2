Duration: a few seconds. 4/16/2014, my wife and I were driving northeast on AZ 77 approximately 1/2 mi northeast of the intersection with AZ 79 in the town of Oracle.  Writer observed 4 or 5 round shaped, orange-tinted lights in the sky, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, in an easterly direction from our position.  At first, they appeared to possibly be some type of aircraft flying in formation, four across, covering an area of sky equal to approximately one fist held at arm's length.  The lights appeared at first to be stationary and about the size of aircraft landing lights. There were no other visible aircraft running lights.  I pointed them  out to my wife. Then, the four or possibly five lights, split off from formation, appearing to go upward, then disappeared.  I hate to make this comparison, but they looked very much like the preliminary aircraft first shown in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, kind of streaking off in different directions. I opened my moonroof, hoping to hear the sound of jet engines or something that might help identify the lights, but there was only silence.  As for distance from my vehicle, if I were forced to guess I would say the lights were within a few miles, but as you know it is difficult to estimate such things. At this time, the sky was clear.  Temperature approximately 75 degrees F. at ground level.  Low humidity.  No moonlight. Upon arriving home I called the county sheriff's office to inquire if they had received calls about the lights.  The told me no, and transferred my call to your person at ufo center.;32.6004;-110.8002
