It shot across the sky and then slowly returned to its original position.   It looked like it was separating into two lights, so we retrieved some binoculars, we distinctly saw two lights alternating blue and white, and then kind of merge together. It didn't move for about forty five minutes, so we came inside to go to bed, twenty minutes later, I went to get a drink of water, and checked to see if it moved.  It was still there, flickering, so I drank a glass of water, looked again, and it was gone.   The little dipper was, from my point of view, about a hand length above the light when we first noticed it, and almost two hand lengths above the last time I saw it, so it did not move with the stars, it stayed in the same position as the stars moved ten to fifteen degrees.;32.6004;-110.8002
