We were watching some air traffic that fly over the house checking out the moon and the planets. After the last plane went near the horizon, I ask my wife to look at the planets because one of them started to move SE and gained speed greater than that of the planes we were watching. After about 3 seconds of speed the object then veired upwards and began a high rate of climb. I told my wife that I have never seen anything climb that fast. The object went straight up and the yellow light got smaller and then faded out of sight. The object did look like a yellowish planet in the SW night sky. If it did not move I would have never noticed. I believe the object was far higher than the planes were flying. From where the object was sitting, it had a clear view of the coal electric generating plant in Joseph City.;34.911;-110.1419

On the evening of april 15th 2008 at 7:45pm while I was on my security job in holbrook,AZ. it was a clear night with the stars out and no clouds.  I was outside looking at the sky towards the south east and I noticed an object, only one about the size of a planet,like venus or mars at an altitude of about 30,000 feet.  The object was a solid white in color, a glowing appearance and completely still, holding it's position.  I continued to look directly at it and did not take my eyes off the object.  Then suddenly that white object moved quickly in a short distance then sped with a streak in another short distance then it disappeared in the southern direction.;34.911;-110.1419
