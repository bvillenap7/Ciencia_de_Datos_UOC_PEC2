I  may  have  witnessed  a  static  shadow  of  a  cloaked  UFO;2014-09-05 10:21:00;~7 seconds;I  may  have  witnessed  a  static  shadow  of  a  cloaked  UFO I swear to the following statement to be 100% true to what I experienced.   On September 5th 2014 in Holbrook,AZ on a clear blue sky day, I witnessed a static shadow of 100's of black specs on the ground in a 40'x40'area in front of me and at the same time I heard what sounded like a million electronic insects as a background noise.                                                                                   The object that made the static shadow felt close to my location, about 400' above me and the morning position of the sun at 10:21AM and took about 7 seconds for the static shadow to pass by me. I looked up after the static shadow passed and noticed no object(s) at all, only clear blue skies and no clouds at all.
