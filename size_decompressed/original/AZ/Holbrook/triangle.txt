While travelling between Holbrook and Mesa Az, on state route 77  at approximately 21:00,  my wife and I noticed a bright white wedge at high altitude moving from west to east at an extremly high rate of speed.   Shortly after noticing the first object, my wife pointed out a second, stationary object at a high altitude.  This object appeared rectangular, and was formed by 2 large white lights with a single red light between the white lights.  This object remained stationary, though would disappear for approximately 20 or 30 seconds, then reappear in the same location.   Though the white wedged object was only seen for a few seconds, the 2nd object was seen for approximately 45 minutes as we continued southbound on state route 77.;34.911;-110.1419
