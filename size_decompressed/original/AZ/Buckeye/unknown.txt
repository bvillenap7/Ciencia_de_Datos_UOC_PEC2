3 shiny object in sky. One still the other two moved to the right and left.;2008-06-25 15:00:00;5 minutes;3 shiny object in sky. One still the other two moved to the right and left. My husband and I were relaxing int he pool on afternoon. He was playing with the dog as I lay on my raft catching some sun. the sky was clear blue. I saw a shining object fairly high in the sky. At first I just thought it was an airplane. We see alot of planes in the area. we live behiind the white tank mountains and close to the Air Force Base, so I know the difference between regular air craft and a jet. Normally when there are planes in the sky you can hear them. The sounds seems to bounce of the mountains. But , there was no noise. I cant say how far away it was. After about 2 Minutes I noticed it had not moved. My husband said it was probably just a piece of trash or a bird. It was very shiny. I noticed moments later that there was three objects of the exact same sape and refplectivness. These were not birds nor was it trash. I watched them and one of the shapes to the right seemed to be moving away to the right of the other and up at the same time. The object on the far left moved to the left and disappered. The object in the middle seemed to be not moving at all. Within an instant I no longer saw any of them. The one in the middle did not fly across the sky like the other two it just suddenly was gone. My husband saw them as well. I now this was not any aircraft that we see normally because of it's reflectivness or that it made no sound. the movement was not like any airplanr or jet in the area. Some of my friends and family claim to have seen unexplainable things in this area for years. Mostly at night. this was the first time I had seen something like this in the daytime. This area had alot of unexplainable activity and if I knew how I would investigate further. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
