Just after 8pm tonight, April 23rd, me and my two son's witnessed multiple air force fighter jet's flying at a high rate of speed pursuing what appeared to us as 2 triangle shaped or V-shaped craft that were hovering over the White Tank Mountain Range here in Buckeye, AZ.  We witnessed the 2 craft above the mountain range while driving back from the store on Yuma Rd.   I pointed out to my sons the craft and we pulled into our driveway and were able to then see and hear multiple air force jets fly toward's these 2 triangle shape craft and the 2 craft appeared to just blink off their lights.   The craft both each had 3 glowing white/blueish light's in the form of a triangle and one of the craft appeared to have an haze or foggy cloud in or around it.  The fighter jet's circled the mountain range for a few minutes and then flew northwest.   I am currently still watching this mountain range and if any new development's I will report them.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
