two different multi-light configurations that changed position and appeared low in the sky south of Buckeye, Arizona;2005-10-11 19:00:00;30 minutes;two different multi-light configurations that changed position and appeared low in the sky south of Buckeye, Arizona Observed 4 yellow-orange, pulsing lights in the southern sky at about 10 degrees above the horizon (at about 1900 hours) and appeared to be above the Buckeye Hills to the south of Buckeye, Arizona.   The first observation was from a location of Southern Avenue and Miller Road.  The lights were directly south and at my 3 o'clock as I was travelling east.  The lights appeared to fade and intensify slowly.  The lights remained stationary in an inverted check mark position for about 5 minutes and then faded one by one.   At about 1910 hours the 4 lights re-appeared in a straight line, again about 10 degrees and at about 200 degrees from a location at 231st Ave and Watkins Street near Buckeye.  About 1 - 2 minutes later, 4 additional yellow-orange lights appeared at about 170 degrees (just east of south) and about 15 - 20 degrees above the horizon as viewed from the 231st Ave and Watkins location.  These lights were configured in a triangle (3 of them) and the fourth was directly above the peak of the triangle.  These appeared to be very much like the grouping west of there in that thy also were very bright, yellow-orange with very slight twinkling (probably due to atmospheric conditions that low in the sky).   About 2 minutes after the sighting of the traingular-pattern lights, the lights to the west that were in a straight-line configuration began to fade one at a time.  At about 1915, the traingular-pattern lights faded, one-by-one.  Approximately 5 minutes later, the 3 lights appeared in the same location as the traingular pattern lights.  The 3 lights were in an inverted L configuration.   After about a minute, the lower light slowly moved to the west until it was in an inverted triangle position. Then the right-most light moved left (east) and appeared to converge with the remaining light whose position remained unchanged.  This configuration remained about 5 minutes.   Another potential sighting was made about 5 minutes later, but after a minute or so did not seem to be the same as the previous sightings (i.e., not as bright, did not fade in and out, and was almost white)....also one of the suspected lights we believed to be an airplane.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708

Started as always with 2 due south of us (loop 303 and Northern Ave) in the area of Goodyear.  We also saw a line formation (east to west) just to the South/West of our location to the buckeye area.  And then to My surprise, there was also another formation just to the West of them in a vertical line (up/down). In total, East/West line formation of 5 Orange Lights, and then just to the West and a little lower than the first line was the second formation up/down of another 5.  And then we also had the 2 to the South and a Third joins them in the middle and just above them.  It Was A Great Viewing Night For Us.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708

I had everyone in the car look too and we were all in awe for about 5 minutes.   We dropped my bf off, which only took a minute, went back to where we could see them and they were gone.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
