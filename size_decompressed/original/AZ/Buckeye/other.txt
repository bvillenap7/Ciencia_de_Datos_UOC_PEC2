Helicopter like ufo out in broad daylight with no noise, propellers, and up close.;2010-11-12 17:35:00;15 seconds;Helicopter like ufo out in broad daylight with no noise, propellers, and up close. I was heading west on the I-10 about to reach Buckeye, AZ.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed that there was what I thought at the moment, a helicopter shinning its light onto the empty field.  It was slowly moving towards the highway coming from the north and that is when it caught my attention. I was about 300+ yards from getting towards the point where I would cross its path and that's when I gave it my full attention.  It was a futuristic science fiction like helicopter.  It did not have any propellers and it did not make any noise.  It was still clear day light outside yet it had a bright row of lights in front of it. I was about 50 yards from it when it was about to fly over the highway, but it all of a sudden did a kite like dive 180 and it drifted away at very high speeds.  Its row of 3 to 4 lights attached to its front managed to blind me for a second as it turned.  It did not leave behind a trail of smoke and it never made a single noise. There should be many more witnesses to this event.  The highway was quite busy.  Could it perhaps be a highly classified military vehicle taken out on a joy ride?

After about two minutes as I was facing west a v shaped craft with about fourteen dim red lights on underside flew overhead traveling in a southwestern direction. The craft had the wing spand  on a 747 at about thousand feet a.g.l. The craft made no noise.

They all flashed in there own manners with some on for seconds, and some only flashing periodically.  Once I watch those disappear north.  I bought a single on heading west for about 3 minutes then turned and darted north towards the others. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
