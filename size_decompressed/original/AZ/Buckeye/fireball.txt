AT LEAST 19 LIGHTS OVER BUCKEYE-GILABEND AREA , 3 NIGHTS IN A ROW FROM 8:30-9:30PM;2005-09-08 20:30:00;1 hr X's 3 days;AT LEAST 19 LIGHTS OVER BUCKEYE-GILABEND AREA , 3 NIGHTS IN A ROW FROM 8:30-9:30PM The fisrt night on 09/08/04 there were a total of seven lights on the Estrella Moutains, they would light up and eventually disappear. One of them lite up the clouds so bright,that was the only time that they got that bright. It happened between 8:30 and would go till about 9:30. The jets from Luke Air force base flew out there so fast it was unbelievable then they flew back just the same,like something was wrong.  The second night, they would light up in different spots and the jets would go out and come back again. around thesame time.  The third night the lights came out slowly, and eventually seven lights formed in a perfect line. The two middle lights for a few minutes were diagonal in the middle of the formation. They did not get very bright. When looking through a telescope they looked like they were on fire and spinging in circles in one spot. At one point you could see smoke trails come from each light. Again the Luke, jets came out extremely  quick,maybe even more faster than before right over our house. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident may be approximate.

Red Fire Orbs over Arizona;2012-06-16 20:00:00;2.5 hours;Red Fire Orbs over Arizona June 16, 2012  Buckeye, Arizona My 2 daughters, son, daughter-in-law and myself were outside when we saw a red object, it appeared to be round and not really a light, more like fire.  It came from the Southwest, then made a turn to the North and proceeded until it disappeared. I live in Buckeye and have seen lights over the south for several years, but these are more yellow in color and don't move across the sky, they just hang there and disappear and reappear for anywhere between a few minutes or sometimes almost an hour.  Luke AFB says they are flares, but they don't look anything like the flares that I saw that Luke has released. Later, around 10:00PM my kids came in and got me out of bed and said they were back.  One would appear follow the same path, then disappear.  A few minutes later another one would appear and do the same thing.  We live where there are numerous flight a day come over our house including the F-16's from Luke, these lights were like none of these and didn't follow any flight pattern that I have seen before. My daughter took video, with her digital camera, the shots aren't the best and her hands were not steady, but it definitely shows the light.  This happened about four times after 10, then stopped and we went in. I don't know what these were, but definitely not planes, jets, balloons, etc.... Nothing that I have ever seen.  I guess that makes them Unidentified Flying Objects.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
Flashing orange lights, stationary but abruptly grow dim.  Pulsating with small beams of red and white.;2015-01-25 20:15:00;10 minutes;Flashing orange lights, stationary but abruptly grow dim. Pulsating with small beams of red and white. Two orange flashing lights that were stationary, seemed to be flashing small beams of white and red.  They were not as high as the airplanes (we are approx 30 miles from Phoenix Sky Harbor, we see a number of aircraft daily).  One abruptly went dim but the other flashed longer, tried to video with camera but can only see small pulsating light in the recording.   They were southwest from my vantage point.  I would not have even noticed because of the many aircraft regularly in my vicinity, but bright, stationary lights that pulsate, then dim, then begin to pulsate, before disappearing, is odd.   Using field glasses I could see they were circular.  They did not move but seemed to be hovering.   Very odd and I have to say after wracking my brain for logical explanation, this has left me scratching my head.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
Orange glowing lights in the Estrella mountains;2021-01-27 18:30:00;~1 hour;Orange glowing lights in the Estrella mountains All in all, I have 10 videos of what I observed over the hour or more we were out by Stardust Ranch. Most of the lights would form out of a bigger orange light and once they got a certain distance away from the bigger light, they would start flashing like an airplane, blending in with all the other twinkling lights in the sky. And after a while they would come merge back or get close to the bigger Orange ball and the flashing would intensify between them.  One video you can see them form into a triangle (as we're driving away). Another you can see a plane flying high above the ufo and the bright orange UFO appearing to be mimicking the airplane lights (changing color to match) to the point of almost dimming completely. Another you can see, what I describe as the mothership because it was bigger and brighter and dropping another ship out.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
Sighted south of palo verde power plant in the buckeye hills area.;2021-08-03 22:00:00;1 hour +;Sighted south of palo verde power plant in the buckeye hills area.  Orange glowing balls all flying about the same hieght above ground (15-20deg above horizon when viewed from 10 freeway) spaced out over a good few miles possibly 20+mi.  The orange balls would move gently swaying close to each other, fade out/fade in, come together in pairs and fly high.  The lights have been appearing every night since aug 3 2021- aug 5 around 22:00-2300.  Some nights there are 4 lights other nights I've seen 2 just lights flying around together.  The night of august 4 I Tried to drive to the lights but the further I drove closer the further they seemed to be (very far).  I noticed about 5 other cars pulled over on the road trying to record the lights as well.  I possibly thought they might be hot air. Balloons but they dont appear to have the large balloon above that would glow. The light is also very bright orange glow which seem very big considering how far away they were from my viewpoint.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
