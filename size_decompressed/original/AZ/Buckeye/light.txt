Near Palo Verde Nuclear Power Station, lights seen moving around into a triangular-shaped formation.;2001-07-24 22:00:00;5 minutes;Near Palo Verde Nuclear Power Station, lights seen moving around into a triangular-shaped formation. Around 22:00 near the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Station roughly 20-30 miles west of Buckeye, Arizona, my mom, sister, and I noticed a bright light in the sky, with  a fainter light below it. Suddenly, the bright light went away, and two more fainter lights apeared. The lights moved around until they were in a triangular-shaped formation. Some lights apeared to fade out, but as we drove closer, we saw that they actually went behind a cloud, then reappeared. We also noticed that one of the lights was actually a jet, we could tell by two blinking red and white lights at either side. We could tell the other two lights weren't jets because they seemed to hang in the sky, and they had no other lights on them, like a jet probably would. By then we passed underneath the lights, and moved on. Other lights, unknown number, were noticed along the horizon, not known if they had anything to do with the lights seen before.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
Bright, bright lights that multiplied from 2 - 7  light/danced in the night sky over the estrella mountain traveling W 3 hrs /palo verd;2004-06-21 20:00:00;3 hrs;Bright, bright lights that multiplied from 2 - 7  light/danced in the night sky over the estrella mountain traveling W 3 hrs /palo verd June 21 ,04 night sky is clear in Buckeye AZ as the 7 of us in the Valles family observed the following.  (overlooking into the horizon of the  Buckeye Wal*Mart Distribution Center) our location being between the I-10 freeway in the Sundance Community and Yuma road. We observed several bright lights hovering in the southwest sky. first there were 2 lights that looked  like huge street lights.  they were amber colored and  flickered brillantly in the night sky. then we saw another set of lights multiply from the first two and then two more from the four.there were  six alltogether and a seventh appeared a little further away from the six. they would stay on for 3-4 mins. then they would dissapear like dim away. just seconds later.. further west over near the tonopah area two more lights appeared. these were atleast 20 miles apart from the set of six that we saw in the estrella mountain sky. First one light came on then quickly went off then another light right next to it. if I had to explain it in detail i would say imagine a tractor truck in the sky and it's tail lights are what show as it is leaving  going west, well the tail lights being the distance from one Light to another  is how far apart these lights were to each other. while the other lights are far east more again near the estrella mountain they are a pretty great distance apart in my opinion to be flares or anything military operated. weird as this is we saw them appear and disappear for 3 hours changing location and traveling slowly west toward the palo verde nuclear power plant (while in the off mode of course.) the lights as we saw would vibrate and dance next to eachother and even  seem to colide as if generating energy from one another as to multiply. these lights have been here since we moved in to our new house in May of this year 2004. what are they? nobody seems to know.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708

They just look like a yellow light in the sky and sometimes they are really close and sometimes spread apart.  I see them as I am driving home at night about 7-9pm.  They are above, not high.  As I am driving home on the freeway, about 20 miles away, they disappear and show up about 5 miles more down.  Of course it probably is farther, because these lights are farther out, I only see the light, I havent seen an object yet.

Copper Lights Over Buckeye Arizona;2006-05-04 21:25:00;10 Minutes;Copper Lights Over Buckeye Arizona Shortly before 9:30 PM on Thursday, May 4th, 2006, I left the Buckeye Marketplace shopping mall, which is located on the southwestern corner of Yuma and Watson roads here in Buckeye, AZ.  I drove my SUV out of the mall and proceeded south on Watson.  Suddenly, about 30 degrees above the horizon, in the southwestern sky, there appeared a very bright, copper colored light.  It immediately caught my attention and I pulled onto the shoulder to watch it. The light maintained a consistent intensity and did not move in any direction.  After about three minutes, it suddenly disappeared. I pulled back onto Watson road and drove down to Broadway, where I stopped and made a right hand turn.  I then proceeded west on Broadway and kept looking at the general area where I had seen the copper colored light a couple of minutes prior.   The light suddenly reappeared, with another copper colored companion light, the second light being about ten degrees to the right of, and about ten degrees above the first light.  Both maintained a consistent intensity, but were brighter than the first appearance a few minutes prior.  I would estimate that they were hovering in the area of the Buckeye Hills Recreation Area, which is about eight or nine miles from where I pulled off of Broadway (at the intersection of Broadway and Apache roads) to observe them further.  Neither light made any movement.  I saw at least one other vehicle on Broadway stop and pull over to observe these lights.  After a minute or so, the other vehicle continued on.  I called my wife at our nearby home and asked her to get our camera ready as I was going to come home and try to photograph these lights.  I pulled back onto westbound Broadway and proceed to Miller road.  The entire time the lights were still visible. I maintained visual contact with the lights until I pulled into our subdivision.   I quickly retrieved our digital camera and drove back out onto Miller road, but the lights were both now gone.  I stayed in the area for about twenty minutes, but they did not reappear.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
Lights in the sky at Buckeye Arizona.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly flares over Gila Bend Firing Range.

Lights were twenty miles south of I-10 directly down Watson road. ((NUFORC Note:  Because of both the location, and nature, of the bright objects, we strongly suspect that the bright objects may have been aerial flares, launched from aircraft over the Barry M.

Basically, it looked like a moving star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus or Jupiter??  PD));2007-06-10 01:24:00;About a good half an hour;Basically, it looked like a moving star. I was out with my ex and my good friend just killing time until I went home.  We ended up in a park just down the street from my ex's house, just hanging out.  It'd been a really relaxing night, and in Buckeye, you can see the night sky a ton better than in Avondale.   My ex noticed it first-- a really bright star kind of zigzagging in place, then my buddy saw it and they were both able to describe what was going on, so I knew he wasn't making it up.    We all looked up and watched it for a while.  It was really far up, so it looked like a star, but it was super bright and it moved way too much.  It was way too far to be a helicopter or a plane, and even though a shuttle had launched a few days ago, it moved way too fast to be one.   We also saw two 'shooting stars' that night, both within a few minutes of each other.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
Hovering ligths over Buckeye. Viewed from Miller and Baseline road. Two seperate craft.;2009-12-09 21:00:00;20mins;Hovering ligths over Buckeye.  Viewed from Miller and Baseline road. Two seperate craft. On December 9th 2009 at approximately 21:00 hours, I was driving southbound on Miller road approaching Southern avenue.  I noticed two bright lights to the south that appeared to be about one mile away near the old mill.  As I approached my turn at Maricopa I was still watching the lights as they were out of the ordinary.  They appeared to slowly be moving to the west as I was traveling west down Maricopa road. This is when I became alarmed. As I made the turn onto sunset point south bound, I kept fixated on the two lights hovering in the sky.  They appeared to stop moving. I raced to baseline road as quickly as possible.   When I got there I parked on the south side of baseline looking south.  The object was approximately 300 yards away hovering about 100ft in the air.  I could barely make out a dark silhouette between the lights.  They appeared to slowly begin moving south when the light on the right side of the object flickered out slowly.  The other light remained, but appeared to be dimming.  It took approximately 30 seconds to one minute before the left side or remaining light dimmed then flickered out as well. I regained my composure and began to try to rationalize the sighting.  Maybe it was something I just hadn’t noticed before.  Anyway my Wendy’s was getting cold, so I began to leave.   I looked back up, and the lights were back, but twice as far away as and farther east than before.  I realized I had my digital camera with me, I took video for 1min 45 seconds at this point.  The lights hovered and slowly started to move south. Throughout this entire time the object never lost altitude, and wasn’t moving fast enough to achieve this by conventional means like everyday aircraft. No noise either, just silence. Video was stopped due to poor camera quality. I continued to watch for approximately a minute longer absolutely fixated. I looked away to prep the camera for more video. When I looked up there was another set of two lights. Closer together and not parallel to each other like the first lights. I took video again for 1min 45 seconds. The first set were still there, but began to flicker out just like the first time. First the right one went out quite quickly. Then the left remained illuminated, but appeared to be dimming. The newer set of lights maintained its tight formation with the first object as the remaining light from it disappeared. They then began to slowly move south until I could no longer see them. Entire elapsed time was approximately 20 minutes.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
Orange-Red light over Buckeye, fades away.;2011-10-24 22:15:00;<1 minute;Orange-Red light over Buckeye, fades away. My fiance had texted me as he got off the 10, heading towards home because he likes me to meet him outside so we can have a cigarette before going in for the evening.  Our house faces South and when he parked his car, he was leaning against it, facing West.  I was standing about a foot away from him and noticed a strange orange-red light that was circular in shape, with a section from the center missing. It was almost as if the light were two seperate pieces and were not stuck all the way together.  I said What the hell is that? and he turned to look. There were clouds in the sky, so at first we thought it was possibly a plane and the light was reflecting through the clouds but it slowly faded from view as if on a dimmer switch.  Right after it had faded all the way out, two more lights popped up, right next to where the other had just been.  They shimmered in and then faded out as well, almost as quickly as they had come. Neither of us were sure what we had seen, but with the Luke Boys flying overhead all the time, among with all the other planes we see flying in, we are pretty familiar with our skies.  This was like nothing else. We have witnessed other phenomenon like this, but never as close as this felt.  I am hoping we weren't the only two people to see this, which is one of the reasons why I am reporting this sighting.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
Orange lights over mountain Southwest of Buckeye;2012-04-16 20:53:00;1-3 minutes;Orange lights over mountain Southwest of Buckeye My fiance and I regularly see orange lights in the southwest sky over the mountains. They appear between 2100 and 2230. We don't normally see them every day, but they do show up regularly.  These lights appear one at a time. Often we see them move slightly up and down and side to side. They shimmer in and out slowly, sometimes fading by half and coming back all the way to their brightest. They always fade out when they leave. We never see any craft come or go from the area.  My fiance and I are both former military so we are familiar with flares and the Luke Boys flying overhead, as well as commercial planes and helicopters. We also enjoy star gazing and are familiar with the night sky.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708

I/We have watched them fly, sometimes only one, sometimes a pair, sometimes three pairs, sometimes starts off with only one and then another (or more) shows up after a while and joins, in the low sky level (just above the Prison lights from our view at Olive Ave) to the South and South/West of our job site at the loop 303 at Olive Ave. I/We work Heavy Construction and have built many of the freeways around the valley here. I/We watch them from the &quot&quotfirst light&quot&quot around 9:00/9:30pm as they show up on the South/West direction from Olive Ave, and fly around.Some days they stay around the Buckeye area, some days they fly to the Goodyear area.  I have been watching these Orange Lights out West of Delta UT since 1993, and have watched them up to the week they disappeared from our area for 2 months before they showed up in Phoenix AZ and then called the  &quot&quotPhoenix Lights&quot&quot sighting in March 13, 1997. I have also watched them fly over Gilbert AZ when I was working on building the Loop 202 and US60 interchange. Same flight times, only a South/West small flight area over Gilbert AZ area. I have seen flairs from the military bases up in UT, and with the different yellow/orange glow from them, there is the tail tell sign of the smoke going up in the sky from the flairs. It's been 20yrs that I have been watching these Orange Lights, I keep My car full of gas at all times, so that one day I may be in a position to attempt to locate them. The closest I have come to them was when I was on My way home from work late one night (living in Buckeye AZ last year in the Blue Hills Sub) and heading South on Miller Rd just exit the I-10, and ther! e was a single Orange light due South of Me. I got as close as! getting to Southern Ave when the light turned off. I pulled in to the dirt lot to the West side of the road at Baseline Rd and turned off the car and got out to see if I can see or hear anything. Not a sound out there other than cars. I have watched them fly in the South from My yard in Buckeye AZ. I now live on Sun Valley Parkway just North of I-10 and in the first week of moving here, I have seen them Due South of My window.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708

I was laid off from work this week so I have time to explore now.  Saw the lights at 8.pm,  Drove out to Wintersburg Rd and Elliot Rd to see if I can triangulate there flight area.  They were Still Farther To The South/West And In The Same Position from first sighting in Buckeye, and with all My driving out there. So I have to conclude that the lights are out in or past Gila Bend AZ and possibly South of there even. If there is anyone in that area who can keep an eye out, they have started flying at 20:00 now.  They can't be missed because if they are Dang Bright for Me to see them here, they must be eye burning up close.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708

Two large bright flickering amber lights seen in the southwest sky of Buckeye, AZ.;2016-01-26 20:30:00;30 minutes;Two Large bright flickering amber lights seen in the southwest sky of Buckeye, AZ Driving in Buckeye, AZ, going south, I saw to my right off in the distance 2 large amber lights, flickering midway up in the sky. At first, I thought they might have been flares, so I kept looking at them as I was driving.  I was heading home which is further out on the southern edge of Buckeye.  It took me approx. 10 minutes to get to my street and the lights were still hanging in the sky.   I decided to drive down a country road in that direction to see them better.  I thought I could get closer to them, however after driving a few more miles it seemed I wasn't getting any closer so they must've been further away than I thought.  They were fading in & out and re-appearing either in the same spot as they disappeared in or they re-appeared in a different spot. At one point I saw  a couple of small lights develop out of one of the bigger ones and hung at the same altitude horizontally from the bigger one and then faded out.  They kind of reminded me of Christmas lights blinking but more randomly.  Sometimes they would all disappear and then return.  I did observe one of them very close to the ground. Interesting to note, before I became aware of these strange lights. I saw 2 military jets make a huge U turn around Buckeye flying over the area where I saw the lights, then the jets made a U turn and headed back towards the direction of the AF base.  I thought that was rather odd as they usually head in the direction of Yuma, AZ, where there is another base.  A coincidence or not?  I don't know. I've seen 2 lights in the sky just like that flying back in 2013 coming from the northwest in Buckeye.  No noise from them, no other lights except the amber color.  One flew towards the Luke AFB and the other went straight east towards Phoenix.  They disappeared as they went past me as the amber light appeared to be on the front of the craft and no other lights were on or flashing which was weird in and of itself.  It was flying pretty low, about at the height of what a helicopter would fly. At that time in 2013, a UFO skywatcher I knew had reported 2 amber lights in the sky in Fresno, CA, at around the same time I had seen them and he stated they were heading in the same direction as I saw them coming from.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708

Amber lights south of Buckeye, AZ, appearing for approximately 3 to 5 minutes;2018-12-13 19:50:00;Still going on;Amber lights south of buckeye Arizona appearing for approximately 3 to 5 minutes Last night around 6:30pm, and then again this morning around 5:30am, I saw the same lights and from my perspective thought they were hovering over the high school south of my location.  I distinctly thought that it must be drones or something since they looked like there were right above the football stadium. This time, however, nearly my whole family and I were driving a few miles south of the stadium and saw the same lights, except they looked much further south and appeared to be on or above the mountains south of buckeye, Arizona.  I recognized the same lights and realized I misjudged where they were the previous two times.  There's lights seemed to appear in groups of two or more.  Are amber in color and can be seen for miles away.  They only last for about 10 minutes or less.  It appears to be in a horizontal line and twinkle slightly, causing me to wonder if it was an aircraft.  This time when seeing them they disappeared after about 2 minutes, then another two lights appeared a few miles west and approximately in the same horizontal plane at about the same altitude.  They two lights acted the same, slightly moving or twinkling, but they were slightly farther apart.  They also are now gone.  Lasted for about 3 to 5 minutes.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
Golden Brilliant Lights appearing and dissapearing. Reoccurring sighting.;2020-06-08 20:56:00;20 minutes;Golden Brilliant Lights appearing and dissapearing. Reoccurring sighting. I was riding my bicycle while meditating on the act of inviting any intelligence that could potentially hear me for open communication and contact.  I told them that I bring a message of love and peace and a pure desire for understanding and learning.  I acknowledged that they (whoever can hear me) will have say over how the communication happens.I was meditating on that really hard and when I stopped my bike, I looked up and there were multiple golden balls/points of light glittering in the sky. Some remained stationary, some moved around, and some of them seemed to jump across the sky. I was able to record some video. I have seen these several times before and am happy to provide more information upon request.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
