Strange blue light above the western horizon lasting 45 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.

PD)) Last night I went outside into the backyard to check the temperature of my pool.  As I walked back to the house.  I happened to look into the western sky.  At approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.  I noticed a bright white colored light.  It appeared that there was kind of a hazy cone shaped light coming from the original light that I saw.   The hazy light was strange.   Because it only went in one direction from the original light that I saw.  If you were looking at the face of a clock.  The original light was where the 2 would be.   The hazy light came from the original light and looked like a cone.   The broadest portion of the cone would be from the numbers 8 to 6 on the face of a clock.   However, the hazy light soon surrounded the original light.   Then there appeared to be this blue light in the center of the haze that touched the original light.  I called my wife from the house and she witnessed the entire transition.  The blue light continued f! or approximately 15 minutes.   Then it began to fade, the haze gradually faded away and the original light disappeared as well.   There was no noise of any type at any time.;33.4125300813008;-112.534270731708
