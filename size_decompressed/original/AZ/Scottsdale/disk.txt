In the distance where two smaller objects that blinked in color and did funny manuvers like a worm going verticle in the sky.  My husband and I watched till 11:30PM Talked to neighbors and nobody saw it.  Then on the next eveing the big disc was back almost in the same spot.  Every night we would see it close to the original site . We thought it was a planet but couldn't understand the flashing lights.  On Sept.23rd,98 we saw what appeared to be a star explode in to a red fireball and disapear. My husband is a retired chemical engineer and couldn't give any clue to what we were seeing.  We live on a small lake and alot of strange lites and noises usually in the evening around 10pm on.  We have seen 2 bright lights in the sky that  looked like headlites but did not shine on  the ground .  What ever these strange stars are come from the north and moves east.  This all started Sept. 19th.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Large silver saucer with dome on top, a light that went from right to left through its middle, hovering.;2001-07-24 23:30:00;3+;Large silver saucer with dome on top, a light that went from right to left through its middle, hovering. The flying object was a large siver saucer with a dome on top. All of its edges were roundded and gradual. It had a light through its middle that went from left to right. It moved slowly across the sky until i lost sight of it from my moving position in my car. I always thaught there could be a chance, but it was never something I thought I would see so clearly. (NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with a UFO investigator in the Phoenix area, and we believe that the report may have been caused by a sighting of a popular blimp, which advertises beer.  However, this is only a guess, and we are uncertain about our surmise in this case, since we do not know if this particular blimp flies at 11:30 p.m..  Something similar was reported from Phoenix on July 23, as well.  Please see other reports for July 23, and 24.   We believe that the correct date should be July 24, 2001, and we have changed it here.  PD));33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

5 ships move from n.east to the south. All ships of disk shape.;2004-02-03 23:00:00;30min.;5 ships move from n.east to the south. All ships of disk shape. My wife and I witnessed 5 disk shaped ships enter the lower atmosphere. All ships came from a north eastern direction and traveled a southern course. Two ships were seen through my night vision scope, this is how I know the shape of the ships. We could hear two ships as they flew by. They sounded as though they were pushing against the air. All ships were glowing red,blue and orange. The faster the ships accelerated the lights would pulsate more rapidly.  All the ships were of equal size and shape. We estimate each ship was the size of a small airliner. My wife and I are investors and also own two companies. Her background was as an advertisement executive in New York, my background was director of operations in my industry. ((NUFORC Note:  We received a telephone call from the witness, but have not been able to reach him via telephone, yet.  To the best of our knowledge, we have received no other reports of the event from this heavily populated area.  PD));33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Daylight Scottsdale Sighting;2005-11-18 15:00:00;15 minutes;Daylight Scottsdale Sighting PD,   My friend and I were walking back to my place in downtown Scottsdale (Camelback and Scottsdale Rd) from having seen a great movie at the Camel View 5 theatre and I just happened to look up, East (we were walking from west to east), and I observed two silver ball shaped images in the sky.   At first I thought they were just random balloons floating upward.  My friend also took notice of them, so I know I am not seeing things in my declining years PD!   Then we observed a third object just appear, it was very weird to see two, look away for a split second, look back up and then have there be three objects!  This was in broad day light, no clouds, nothing, come on, itâ€™s Arizona! Big blue, clear skies.  This is not the first time I have witnessed strange objects in the Arizona sky.  Specifically the Central (Metro Phoenix) area.   So, we just continued to walk back to my place and eventually lost interest.  They were silver and shinny.  Too high to really detail the precise design or any specific shapes however, I do not think they were balloons as they were not moving or being blown in any specific direct rather, just hanging out, enjoying the view of downtown Scottsdale!   I'd say the altitude was between 1000 - 2000 ft.   Thanks, PD!;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Disk like craft, fairly low flying, silent, no lights.  A Y shape was centered in the disk and I could see what looked like holes where lights would be. It just cruised on past, and I was left speechless.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

I thought it was a helicopter but it wasn't making any sound. As the object was floating towards me going North I saw that it was a copper, rusty looking saucer flying at a low altitude. It floated right over my head above the condo and flipped on it's side as it flew over. It looked like an old rusty disk. I tried to call my boyfriend whom was at the store about 1/2 a mile away and his phone was fully charged and his cell phone just stopped working. His screen was white, and his cell phone was fully charged. His computer froze also. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Scottsdale;2011-12-31 20:00:00;45 seconds;My husband and I were driving back from dinner (we were traveling east on Westland in North Scottsdale, AZ) and as we were driving we saw a bluish circular craft flying in the sky in front of us.  We at first thought it was a shooting star as it was traveling quicker than a plane would.   We both realized, simultaneously, that is was not a plane.  It kept traveling at a fast rate and the blue light seemed to have some green to the tint of its light.  It made an arched turn near and above Desert Mountain and than disappeared from sight.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Two neighbors joked saying I was looking at stars until they looked through the binoculars I was using.  A distinct saucer shape with knobs both on top and bottom can clearly be seen with red, blue and green rotating lights. Also noticable were little white lights darting around the object.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Dark & Light Circular Objects Raced Across the Sky.;2017-08-10 14:30:00;2 minutes;Dark & Light Circular Objects Raced Across the Sky Looking in the west direction, black object moved across the sky from south to north moving very fast (arms length cover 5 sec) time.  Object was much higher then commercial airline due to seeing commercial airline moving north to west direction.   Object stopped on a dime then shot straight up no longer in view.  The black disk shaped object had no markings, no lights, no noise and very big.  The size of this object was about 5-6 Boeing 747 in diameter at 80 degrees from my position of view.   Seconds later another large object (white) at the same altitude as the black object moved north to where the black object shot straight up and lost view. The white object was saucer in shape much lighter in color then the first object, also at 80 degrees of view. The white object was moving very fast, (half of arms length covered 2.5 seconds +-)  The white object had no markings, no light, no noise).  Location view Mayo Clinic Shea Blvd facing west, it was truely amazing thing to see, my only regret was that I didn't have time to record or take pictures with cellphone.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
UFO spotted north of Scottsdale Airpark Sept 24, 8:37AM.  White tic-tac shaped UFO stationary, then moves at incredible speed.;2020-09-24 08:37:00;20 seconds;UFO spotted north of Scottsdale Airpark Sept 24, 8:37AM.  White tic-tac shaped UFO stationary, then moves at incredible speed. I was driving to work and was at the corner of Hayden and Frank Lloyd Wright in Scottsdale AZ, driving south on Hayden.  I was waiting at that stop light when I looked to my left and saw this white line in the sky that didn't look right.  I immediately pulled out my phone and pressed the video record button while rolling down the window.  I wanted to be sure it wasn't a reflection off my window.  With the window down it was still visible.  It was not moving.  Just stationary in the sky.  It was a white horizontal line (but the line was tilted) and it seemed to have a bright core.  It looked similar to what you might see with a vapor trail to a jet, however it had a beginning and an end (and the bright core).  Suddenly it moved directly downward and then vanished.  When it moved it seemed not to accelerate, it just sort of adopted a velocity.  It did not change its angle in the sky when it moved downward, it stayed tilted, just moving straight down.  When its vertical position in the sky got to about the same vertical position as the plane (also in the video) is when it vanished.  It was moving vertically for probably about 2 seconds before it vanished.  When it vanished it did not slowly disappear, but rather seemed to instantly vanish.  I could not park there and video tape it because of the pressing traffic.  As I taped it, I was driving too and sadly, when I reviewed the video, my camera accidentally had panned off of the object as I was driving.  So I missed its downward motion and its vanishing.  On the bright side, my brother analyzed the video frame by frame and noticed that after it vanished it appears again off to the left (North).  At this point it is not a line anymore but just the tic-tac shape.  When I stepped through the video I was able to verify my brother's claim, and in fact the object was visible to me in this video in about 5 frames as the white vehicle moves underneath it.  The UFO is flying very fast to the North.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
