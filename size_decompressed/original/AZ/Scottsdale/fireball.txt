An orange fireball above our backyard;1981-05-09 00:00:00;4 hours;An orange fireball above our backyard I'm not sure what month it was, nor the day.  Even the year is foggy.  But I do remember my brother had left for college, so I must have been a Junior in high school.  I had shelves built in to the wall at the foot of my bed.  Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I awoke to a crashing sound on my floor.  I leapt out of bed, headed for the light switch, and flipped it on while runningout the door (feared the boogie man).  As I tried to excape, I ran into my mom who was standing just outside my bedroom door.  She scared me half to death too, since her room was on the opposite end of the house...and she was not the type to check and see what went boom in the night.  I couldn't figure out how she got there so quickly.  I then turned around, out of breath, to see what the noise was.  My shelves had fallen to the floor with all the books, etc...  Relieved, I said, something to the effect of, Oh, thank God, it was just my books.  I flipped off the switch and went back to bed, leaving my mom in the doorway.  She turned the light back on and said, Karen, look out your window, in a monotonous tone.  Now, this is coming from a hyper melodramatic woman.  Again, Karen, look out your window.  I yelled back like the brat that I was, Mom, it was just my books, I'm trying to sleep.  I'll clean it up tomorrow. Now, turn off my light!  And she repeated herself again, Karen, look out your window.  This went on a couple of more times, until I huffed and crawled to the end of my bed, opened the blinds and said, What?  At that very moment, I saw a huge fireball about a hundred yards above our back yard.  It was partically over ours, and the house behind us. I was wowed, and instantly thought that we should call somebody, but I didn't know who.  Just to report it, or to see if someone else had seen it, or, I thought, perhaps it was there just for us.   I wasn't afriad of it.  I thought it was cool. She said that there was no point in calling,that no one would believe us, or someon else would have called in by then.   She said, Yeah, I've been watching it for hours.  It hovering above our yard like that, then it just... and at that very instant, it seemed to respond to her words.  It took off way across the infinite skyline and became the size of a pea, then it zoomed all over the sky and soon anough came back to our backyard, only slightly higher and further away this time.  I ended up getting in my moms bed with her so that I could watch it through binoculars out her sliding glass doors.  It didn't look like fire through the binoculars.  It was not of this earth.  I frustrated me, because I wanted to label it, even the colour seemed to change to various shades of orange.  I'm not sure, but I think I remember seeing a little red.  The colour hovered around the ball, like a tangile hue. I watched it for hours.  I oinged all over the sky, then land slightly further away, over and over and over, until I fell asleep.  I never talked about it again, my mom and I never spoke of it.  Many years later, whenI was about thirty, I called my mom after years of not speaking to her.  I asked for two things 1) my birth certificate and 2) I wanted to know about what she saw.  She said, oh, that thing.  Who knows what that was.  It could have been anything.  HALLO!!!!!;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Sighting of lone fireBall on 09/28/95.In the hours between 8pm and 10pm.;1995-09-28 21:00:00;10-15 Seconds;Summary : Sighting of lone fireBall on 09/28/95.In the hours between 8pm and 10pm. On 09/28/95 I along with family was driving home from dinner to wards Fountain Hills Arizona. I was sitting in the front passanger seatand observed one firery object which I thought were plane lights.  Then I thought it was a missle of some sort.  A ballof fire with a tail.  A comet no.  The ball of fire was traveling on a level plane. The fireball was quite close say 100 yards. It did not come from some distancejust poped in then poped out. (In to a dark small cloud but diddn't come out the other end.)  My family did not see the objectbecause I did not tell them. (They know I study ufo's, and they think I'm Wack.)  A big storm hit that night. I recently moved to Arizona10 day prior.  I don't feel I've never been abducted, my life has many oddities that might say that I was.)  This is not the first sightihgI have had in my life.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

What I saw was what appeared to me as a shooting star, the object resembled a shot from a roman candle that was what I judge as about 10 times that in diameter.  It appeared at the area that I described and traveled at a high rate of speed in a strait line towards the horizon and appeared to be traveling in a descending northwesterly direction.  This lasted about 1.5 seconds and the object disappeared at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  The object did appear to have a slight bluish or greenish tint and was quite bright.  The tail seemed to have the same property of a comet as best as I can describe. The object though appeared to be at a great distance from my location, but still appeared proportionaly large from my perspective. I thought this interesting, mentioned it to my girlfriend who was riding with me.  She had not observed it.  I thought nothing more of this until listening to The Art Bell show this morning at 3 am, and heard the reports from Seattle from Mr. Peter Davenport. I felt compelled to report this in some manner.

Fireball seen in North East sky with short contrail, ending in flash with contrail pointing downward.;2000-02-15 16:30:00;4 seconds;Fireball seen in North East sky with short contrail, ending in flash with contrail pointing downward. Object seen from Hayden road in Scottsdale, about 4:30 pm on 2/15/2000. While driving looking up to North East sky, noticed a bright object, no shape or fireball look, with 2 very short contrail like exhaust behind it. In about 4 seconds,then the object brightened and turned pinkish or redish, with the contrail or exhaust shifting from behind it to directly underneath it and then it vanished, contrail and all. The contrail was about the same width as the object itself and trailed off behind in two distict rows of vapor,quite thick, but very short and not like an airplanes. There was at least one other jet going west at the time of the sighting.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Large blue/white flamed object falling to Earth in the Eastern sky above Phoenix.;2000-09-30 20:00:00;5 seconds;Large blue/white flamed object falling to Earth in the Eastern sky above Phoenix. This large object traveled East to West in the Southern sky above Phoenix. Falling at a very fast speed at an angle that made us believe this was an asteroid or satellite falling through the atmosphere. We did not think this object to be anything but a natural occurance. The object was very large with a tail of flames, blue and white, with the blue color around the flames tail. The flame tail expired as it crossed lower into the Western sky. Again, this path convinced me it was a large object crashing throuth the atmosphere. I waited to hear a sound when I thought it would have landed, but there was none. I accessed your web site after I found no mention of this incident in the local newspaper or televised news reports. I wanted to confirm the identity of our sighting and was suprised to find there is no official word on it's identity. The size & brightness of the object made me assume everyone out of doors that night had seen it. This had to be a large object that hit Earth, possibly somewhere in the desert between Phoenix & California.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
A  slow moving green fireball was seen travelling west to east over the horizon north of Phoenix, AZ.;2001-07-21 21:00:00;10-12 seconds;A  slow moving green fireball was seen travelling west to east over the horizon north of Phoenix, AZ. Sighting ocurred while driving north on Scottsdale Rd in the Pinnacle Peak Rd area. A teacher and a school administrator observed a bright green ball similar in color to the green of a traffic signal. The object was about the the size of a thumbnail on an extended arm. It may have had a short tail but nothing significant.It moved rather slowly across the horizon from west to eas travelling parallel to the earth not far above the horizon. It moved much too fast for an airplane yet seemed to move too slowly for a meteor. It did not fall but continued to move at the same height above the horizon until it was lost behind a cloud.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Two Orbs Seen Over Scottsdale;2002-11-01 20:30:00;15 seconds;Two Orbs Seen Over Scottsdale We were at a restaurant eating dinner when we noticed two bright orange balls of light traveling parallel to each other and the ground.  They were well over the horizon and traveled in a straight pattern for a short period of time.  They appeared to have a tail similar to a comet's.  The objects then veered opposite of their current direction fairly quickly.  One of the objects then stopped moving and started to spin, and then quickly disappeared.  The other ball of light then began to spin for a second or two then disappeared like the other did.  That was the last that we saw of them.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Came down thru clouds and held (hovering or motionless) altidude just under cloud base 10 mins. Brite yellow orange color light/fireball. slow movments north bound. I live near a level 1 trauma center (hospital) that has many life flight helicopters comming and going thru out nights. One came in 5 mins after event giving a better judgement of light color and altitude. It was far too big to be any aircraft I've ever seen and had a feather like movment. It drifted out of sight going north several miles and back into clouds..;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Seven Orange Fireball Objects Dance in the Arizona Moonlight;2012-08-28 02:30:00;10-15 seconds;Seven Orange Fireball Objects Dance in the Arizona Moonlight While walking down deserted road on Indian reservation at 2:30 am, was looking at the moon and noticed 7 or so orange fireball type objects.  They appeared kind of slowly, like when you light a candle and the flame is faint at first then becomes stronger.  While observing this (with much excitement), noticed that two of the orange balls began to move.  They started doing sort of a figure eight around each other, clearly an impossibility for today's aircraft.  They did this for several seconds ( i would say the whole incident was about 10-15 seconds) and then all 7 objects vanished.

Reddish/orangish lights blinking turning off and reappearing at a modest altitude for an hour.;2013-01-14 18:00:00;1 hour;Reddish organish lights blinking turning off and reappearing at a modest altitude for an hour. at about 6 o'clock at work some co workers told me about lights in the sky. intrigued i saw flashing reddish organish lights that were hovering above the ground at an estimated altitude of 3000 feet. they did not move but blinked continuously at a rapid pace, then dim and reappear in a different location. there would be new ones appearing and dimming at different altitudes and close to each other and some spaced. counted 6 at one point.  there were two aircraft nearing the location but still far off and when they got closer at the end they simply turned off one by one til there was nothing. I grew up in as a child of the air force as my father was active duty.   i myself spent 4 yrs in the air force.  I've never seen anything like this. i thought maybe helicopters but no indicator lights flashing green red white. i thought hot air balloons. not sure what it was got some bad pictures on my iPhone... just baffling.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Bright ball, radiatiing fingers of light, dimmed to dark Deep, orange fireball-like glow in sky over North Scottsdale wasn’t a plane and didn’t follow a natural arc or line but rather hovered, then moved south to north, then circled back around and as I pulled over the car and tried to focus and discern what it was it then dimmed substantially, seemingly moved quickly to the north, then circled around and down very quickly as if coming down about 50 feet from me, then up behind my car in a small, dark form.   Scared me so I rolled up my windows, closed my sunroof and drove off.   I sensed something coming down out of the sky and moving toward me.   Very unnerving.- educator, mother, business-owner, alone in car;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Bright fire orange in color..  When first seen it seemed to be lower towards the ground mabey 100 ft.  I pulled over to watch and record with my phone and it slowly moved higher and began to move north/west.  Not in a straight direction either.  Moved off in the distance and continued to seemingly burn bright orange.  Simply faded. Not because of distance away but the light slowly dimmed and disappeared.  Just gone.  It was substantial in size when first observed. Crazy..;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Two Orange Balls of Light Over Scottsdale, AZ.;2014-08-08 21:00:00;30 seconds;Two Orange Balls of Light Over Scottsdale, AZ My son and his two friends called me excitedly to come look.  We saw two big orange orbs - almost looked like Chinese lanterns, lit up - moving in a Southeasterly direction at a fairly rapid clip -  I went to get my camera and husband, which took me about 15 seconds and by the time I got back, they were almost out of sight, probably over East Mesa.   They were moving side by side and, to me, looked too close together to be aircraft - besides, they were close enough to clearly distinguish that they were round in shape.   Have never seen anything like it!;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

These objects were stacked in a vertical fashion in no measured formation with a vector towards the vertical.  These objects appeared to move rather slowly.  The size of each object to be roughly a third the size of a full moon.  No sound included in this sighting.  These objects moved to the vertical to about 60 degrees vertical before the light appeared to suddenly dim, then continued to vertical over head.  A large very dim/muted object three times the size of each individual fireball appeared to travel west, southwest orbitally.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
