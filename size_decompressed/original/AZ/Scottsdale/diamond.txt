Just dropped my Girlfriend off after seeing movie.  Was entering on the 101 Freeway heading south from Shea Rd Exit. At first I though it was a shooting star.  It had a blue/greenish color to it.  It looked like it was going to crash into the indian reservation (Talking Stick Casino) but before it hit, it changed directions and shot across the 101 Freeway toward Phoenix at an AMAZING SPEED and just disappeared as it gained altitude.   Other people on the Freeway saw this too.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
