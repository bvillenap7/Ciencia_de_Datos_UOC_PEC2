Traveling North West above the Fashion Square Mall, Scottsdale Road and Camelback Road, where I work I looked up and through the cloud cover, which was very hazy, I saw an illuminated object which had a very odd shape, which I could hardly make out because of the clouds. It was traveling at a faster pace than a plane and the illumination and/or object seemed to be changing while it was in flight. Several odd shapes within a V and M sort of formation. The illumination was easier to see than the shape itself, it just kinda of glowed above the cloud cover. It was about the size of a harvest moon, but not that far away. It was definately in our atomosphere and above the clouds. Thankyou, maybe others saw also?;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

I couldn't sleep last night till 3.30 AM and Every day before I go to bed I stand behind the sliding door on the second floor and stare at the sky. Last night it was different, It shocked me, I dindn't know what to do, to scream out of happiness and fear,to run an wake up mu son so I can have a witness or to get my camera. Finally between watching what seemed to have massive light and a tail object changing shape to a full circle then half a circle, I steamed downstairs to my office and grapped the camera and put it on nightshot, by then the half circle began to disapear, but I cought a glimpse of it which you could freeze and see on my film. Please have someone contact me and I will supply you with the film. ((name deleted));33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Round to oval morphing Characteristics;2004-11-20 20:00:00;10 minutes;Round to oval morphing Characteristics My wife and her sister were heading to the Pavillion Shopping mall when they both spotted what at first was an round object that morphed into an oval and back. Object appeared to move a short distance in a straight trajectory,stop abruptly then reverse to it's original starting point.After a short period of time the object flipped on its side. My wife who is a skeptic explained how wierd it was and assured that it was not a spotlight or balloon. It had flashing white strobes around the perimeter and was had distinct smaller circles inside the outer perimeter for an almost layered effect for lack of better words. She had the feeling that the object was not solid due to the morphing effects. I will check the news tommorrow to verify any potential eyewitnesses. She thought it odd that due to it's immense size and odd characteristics that no one stopped or pulled over.She is sure that others had seen it as well.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Pulsating twinkling light in the sky over the mountains in SW Phoenix.;2005-01-10 22:06:00;35 minutes;My husband and I went to get gas (in 2 separate cars) at approximately 10:00 p.m.  As I was nearing the gas station at approximately 10:06 pm, I noticed a strange pulsating twinkling light in the sky over the mountains in SW Phoenix.  This is the 4th time I've seen a light like this.  (I previously reported them last year.)  I drove in to tell my husband who was ahead of me and after I got gas, I left the station and saw that the light was still in the sky.  I raced home and went upstairs to view from a bedroom window.  I wanted my mother who is visiting from Houston to see these lights because they are so unusual.  My husband, mother and myself watched the light and saw it elongate and appear to be a craft with 3 lights.  I called a friend who lives approximately 1/2 a mile from me and she and her husband went outside to view the lights as well.  We watched them for about 20 more minutes.  During this time another craft seemed to come from behind the first one that looked identical to the first one and it slowly separated from the other one and moved further across the horizon.  Then they both seemed to fade out.  I'm not sure that I can rule out a helicopter.  There was no sudden erratic movement of either.  But during all of this there were several other planes in the sky both around these objects and in completely other directions.  I wanted to report it in hopes that if there were other reports it would helpful.  My location is at McDowell Mountain Ranch Road and 105th Str.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
5 white changing objects and 3 color changing all following eachother in groups.;2005-07-09 01:23:00;1 hour;5 white changing objects and 3 color changing all following eachother in groups. Small white changing shape objects were high in the sky. Suddenly 2 more appeared behind it and went alot lower then the other one. It seemed they were about 500 feet in the air or less. Then another 2 changing shape object changed into different colors and sat in the sky for a while. Some stayed in the sky and some others moved slowly around and circles. It stayed like this for about an hour. Then suddenly one zoomed out of the sky and the others followed. It zipped so fast out of the sky;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Object morphed after descent;2008-09-17 14:25:00;10 minutes;Object morphed after descent Myself and co-worker stepped outside at approximately 2:25 p.m on a smoking break.Above Scottsdale airport we had noticed what looked like a square reflective piece of paper descending slowly in a falling leaf motion.At roughly 1500 to 1800 ft. the object changed into a classic oblong cigar shaped object and slowly departed to the North towards Cave Creek.At first we thought it was a piece of paper and immediately due to the charactaristics assumed that it might be an aluminum part that may have falling off of an aircraft.We abandoned that idea once the object stopped falling. About 3 of the 10 minutes we thought that there was a conventional explanation but as ourr minds were processing the info we quickly realized something much weirder was going on.I have never seen anything like this in my life before and am a slight bit shaken up as I type this.I came across this website while doing a Google search.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Three bright lights in a triangle formation low on the horizon disappearing and reappearing as well as traveling.;2016-01-06 19:30:00;>1 hour;Three bright lights in a triangle formation low on the horizon disappearing and reappearing as well as traveling. ((male name deleted)) and 110th st.  Scottsdale, AZ, higher than the rest of the valley 7:30-8:30pm  I stepped outside to see three large bright lights in the sky in a triangle formation.  I was driving but every time I looked they had rotated while staying in a triangle.  If you had a full moon and put a point on the top and sides of a full moon, I would say this is how far they were from one another.  By the time I pulled over there was only one light left I told my boyfriend I wasn’t going anywhere until this light disappeared.  It was not above me in the sky, but south of me low on the horizon. Another bright light reappeared nearby the other.  One left its location and slowly crossed the sky.  It decreased in brightness and traveled east to west.  If you split the sky in 18 sections, it would cross one of these in a little less than a minute.  Planes flew by but were fast and not nearly as bright as even the traveling UFO.  The light they emitted was pure white.  When they traveled they usually got dimmer.  I took off my glasses and the only light I could see in the sky, including stars, were these lights. We starred at them freaking out with excitement for an hour.  They would occasionally disappear and reappear in a nearby location.  My boyfriend and I argued of what he thought was a plane at about 8 o’clock.  It had two very dim white lights flashing very close in proximity and moved faster than the UFO’s before.  I convinced him that it was a UFO because the lights were not consistent in spacing.  They also would fly back and forth from east to west. Also I do not know if it was just me because I was wearing glasses, but they individually appeared to be elongated vertically.  The light looked like it came to a small point and expanded to the rest of the light. It was very subtle, but he said he could kind of see it too. We ended up leaving before they were gone.  At midnight I was back on the road and I could see one bright UFO.  A couple minutes passed and it was gone I didn’t see anything else this night.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Numerous objects (6+) moving in various directions being pursued by military crafts it appeared, nighttime above Scottsdale, AZ.;2018-08-05 20:48:00;>1 hour;Numerous objects (6+) moving in various directions being pursued by military crafts it appeared, nighttime above Scottsdale, AZ. 1450ft above sea level. Viewed from 33°36’48” N x 111°52’35 W Viewed with a naked eye  Numerous unidentified “aircraft” shaped objects above North Scottsdale, Sunday, August 5th, 2018, at 8:48 p.m. The initial object was a solid bright orange, not flashing, then the orange disappeared and was replaced by what appeared to be all dark with a spotlight being adjusted.  This object was moving NE to SW, then changed direction and moved W, it flew at increased and decreased pitch like a greater-than-less-than symbol. Several airplanes appeared shortly after and began flying towards the object, at which point three additional objects that appeared to look like Military Drones, as they were torpedo-shaped but with large bat or seagull shaped wings.  As it was dark outside, I determined shape by looking at the cast of the light.  Eventually a fourth object that was solely a golden Naples-yellow color appeared where previously I had identified Venus as being with the use of the SkyView Application, as if the lights were just turned on, and then the object began traveling quite slowly North to South. All of the objects with the exception of the identifiable aircraft were silent, and no wind sheer could be heard.  The initial object appeared to be around 15,000 feet high, while the other objects appeared to be above the 38,000ft altitude most commercial aircraft fly at. Then at 9:35pm what initially appeared to be a military aircraft, silently jettisoned across the sky very quickly, North to South, before eventually turning and heading East also seen from Scottsdale.  Though initially it appeared to be a military jet with traditional lighting for perhaps a Stealth plane or an F18 Hornet, then the lights suddenly vanished and a golden light overtook the silhouette of the aircraft and instead of traveling East it made a full loop very quickly as if traveling faster than anything I’d ever seen before, at which point a loud guttural sound was heard, perhaps it was an antique military craft, but all observations do not support that theory.  Throughout the totality of the event a plethora of sounds could be heard from airplane, to jet sounds, to sounds similar to motor boats, as well as sounds similar to Electronic music synthesizers. The initial observer and his fiancée  are a 34 year old man and a 33 year old woman ,residents of Scottsdale, who is originally from Chicago and recently moved to Arizona in 2017, initially moving to Wickenburg before moving to Scottsdale on 1/118.  The man is a graduate of Columbia College Chicago and has a degree in Art History and has a passion for art, fashion, photography, wildlife, poetry, literature, history, Geology, Lapidary, Nature, and Politics.  The woman studied Pre-Med at Northwestern University Chicago and received an additional degree in Creative Non-fiction from Pitzer College, California, she top shares many of the same interests, and they both work in high fashion retail management. The third observer is an Arizona native, 35 years old, with a history of drug abuse and extensive criminal background, the fourth observer is also an Arizona Native who works in Engineering and Refrigeration, lives in Scottsdale and enjoys off-roading.  He is 39 years of age.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Saw what seemed to be a regular aircraft, but turned out to be a physics defying encounter.;2020-09-27 01:20:00;5 minutes+;Saw what seemed to be a regular aircraft, but turned out to be a physics defying encounter. It was around 1:15 am, Saturday night, Sunday morning. When I decided to go out and have a cigarette. First, I looked out my northern facing window. To check for animals, etc. And I saw what I first thought to be a normal plane or aircraft heading from the North/Northeast direction. Coming towards towards me, so probably heading toward the South/South East. After I went outside, on my porch. I looked around the side of my house (North/Northeast facing). Again, to check for Animals. And I saw the aircraft heading in my direction.  But this time, It seemed characteristically different. The tint was the normal yellow-ish.  Like from an airplanes guiding light.  But yet, there was still no emergency light blinking. The craft then seemed to be almost above my house, at the normal altitude of the regular aircraft's in my area. (And it seemed to be on the normal flight path too.)  Then all of a sudden. IT STOPPED. Midair. Stayed there for about 30 seconds. It got brighter, and looked to now be an orange tint light. (I tried to get a video, but my phone was in the wrong mode.) And before I could gather any sound evidence. The craft LITERALLY went back the way it came, and disappeared. No U-Turn. IT just stopped, Mid-Flight. Went dimmer, and shot off the way it came. That was it.  The whole encounter lasted about 3-5 minutes.  (I'm also counting from when I first saw it through my north facing window before going outside.)  When I first thought it was just a regular aircraft.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
