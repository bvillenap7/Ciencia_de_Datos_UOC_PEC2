Broad daylight sighting of enormous craft outside of Scottsdale Arizona May 13, 1995 around 2:00pm by husband and wife for about 20 min;1995-05-13 14:00:00;20 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We generally do not include information or reports about dreams, but this witness identifies himself, and his report appears to us to be a serious-minded, carefully prepared statement of what he and his wife seem to remember.  PD)) Broad daylight sighting of enormous craft outside of Scottsdale Arizona May 13, 1995 around 2:00pm by husband and wife for about 20 min I awoke this morning 4/10/01 with a vivid yet hazy recollection of an event that happened back in 1995.  The memory itself is strong and undeniable yet when I try to concentrate on the event, I can recall it only as through a veil of mist.  On the day in question, however, the weather was perfectly clear.  A beasutiful blue desert sky.  I cannot begin to remember what first caught my attention, but I do recall the gist of the conversation I had with my wife.  Is that what I think it is?  I can't beleive it could be anything else It's so huge for about twenty minutes we observed a huge silvery grey craft.  I first remembered it as being Large and round but throughout the day I remember the round craft as being one type along with two others that joined the much larger craft which I now seem to remember as being somewhat angular.  As for its' shape, I cannot find the words to describe how immense it was.  It moved fairly slowly for the time we observed it.  I do not recall how it came to leave our sight. As for the other objects I beleive I saw, there were some large round ones, and two types of smaller ones.  Had I seen the smaller ones by themselves, I do not beleive I would have described them as small but in relations ship to the large craft, they seemed somewhat diminutive.  I am overwhelmed by my memory of the large craft.  My wife remembers the large craft as being oval. This does not fit my recollection.  Nor does she recall any other smaller craft.  What puzzles me most, I think, is that we did not talk about this event for any length of time after it happened.  It seemed so, Matter of fact It seems to me that an event such as this would have been life changing but strangely enough this has not been the case.  I spent some time this evening searching the web to see if anyone else witnessed what we saw on or around the same period of time with no luck.  Perhaps it was some foggy dream of my own creation I say to myself, yet when I asked my wife if she recalled anything, she quickly was able to verify a similar sequence of events.  Our details do not seem to coincide, but the overwhelming memory of the event, for me, precludes any immediate need for corraboration(sp?)  I am not now, nor have recently been under the influence of any medication alcohol or illness.  I do not now nor do I have any family history of any mental illness.  I am not given to flights of fantasy yet do not generally take the role of unreasonable sceptic.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

I looked in that direction (E-NE) and heard a second noise exactly the same and saw an ignited type flash - bright green - streak down from the sky coinciding exactly with the noise. I was standing in my arcadia doorway smoking a cigarette when  we heard an extremely loud noise, my husband describes it as a rocket engine noise, that seemed extremely close.  I stepped out of the doorway to look in that direction and heard a second noise exactly the  same.  At that time I was looking at the horizon (tree top level) and saw a bright green flash ( I did not see the ignition it was a flash that had occurred and retained the shape of the flash).  It was like a jagged edged star with many irregular points, like a cartoon explosion.  It was bright green, rimmed with white, and retained that complete shape as it streaked down from the sky.  The streaking downward coincided directly with the loud noise (the noise followed the downward path) until it was below my point of vision.  It did not burn out on it's way down but retained the shape the entire time.  I did not hear a crash or any ending, the noise just quit. From my location at Scottsdale Rd. and McDowell Rd. it would have been approximately over 4 Peaks or maybe a little south of there.  There were very few stars in that direction, and it occured between two stars that are about 2 fingers apart vertically at arms length, and about 6-7 inches above the horizon at arms length.  It started just below the top star and a little to the north, and streamed down at about a 60 degree angle in a northwesterly direction.  The entire episode lasted about 10 seconds.  My husband heard the sound but wasn't out the door quick enough to see it.  I am 39, white female, college educated, and have never seen anything like this before.  I was completely awake, sober and the sky was clear and cool.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Today's departure flight path was east co-insiding with craft's flight path. Craft exhibited odd flight behavior different from airliners I had just seen and no exhaust trail. 3 visible lights yellow/white, laser like red and luminous blue, 3 locations on craft: nose or front end of craft, mid craft and aft end. first the nose light then the mid light then the aft x2.  Speed seemed much faster than airliners, direction of travel coupled with location of sun in relation to my location, the lights should'nt have been reflections from the sun nor as bright, as I had not seen even a glint off the airliners or any marker/landing lights. The craft was silent and the 4 airliners where quite audible and exhaust trials visble.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Four strange lights sighted over Scottsdale, Arizona  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly flares over Gila Bend Firing Range.  PD));2007-02-06 20:00:00;5 minutes;Four strange lights sighted over Scottsdale, Arizona We witnessed four objects that hovered over Scottsdale.  They were not helicopters and did not follow any flight pattern. The four objects were equidistant from each other. After about 4 minutes one of the objects faded out, and the others followed suit. These were not flares.  These were stationary objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Because of both the location, and nature, of the bright objects, we strongly suspect that the bright objects may have been aerial flares, launched from aircraft over the Barry M. Goldwater Firing Range, located near Gila Bend, AZ.  That is what official military sources apparently reported, shortly after the event had occurred, and we have no reason to doubt that claim.

A small white star next to the sun in Scottsdale, Arizona.;2007-06-18 11:30:00;At leats 2 and a half hou;A small white star next to the sun in Scottsdale, Arizona. Me and my dad were hitting fly balls at a school across the street from us. I am interested in airplanes, and we live about 40 minutes away from Sky Harbor International Airport. I like to look at the different planes flying over our heads when I hear them, but when I was looking at a plane, I saw a white speck about an inch away from the sun according to me standing on the ground. It looked like a star and was really high. It didn't seem to move at all for about 30 minutes. I showed my dad, and he didn't know what it was. When we got home, I found a pair of binoculars and tried to observe the object from our backyard. I couldn't make out what it totally looked like because the binoculars kept moving a little. But I could tell it didn't look like a weather balloon or an aircraft. By then, it actually was moving but at a very very slow pace. It now seemed about 3-4 inches away from the sun. I then got our telescope out and tried to focus on it. When I got it, the image was really blurry but now up close it had a goldish shade to it. I picked up my binoculars again and looked at it, and it looked the same as before. Then when I tried to focus the telescope on it again, I couldn't find it again, but it was still in the sky. Me and my dad have witnessed a similar object about a year ago, but was in a different part of the sky. Who knows, maybe it was the same UFO revisiting.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
I saw a cluster of white lights from 11:30pm-1:00am slowly moving across the sky.;2013-09-11 23:30:00;hour and a half+;I saw a cluster of white lights from 11:30pm-1:00am slowly moving across the sky. At around 11:30pm on September 11, 2013, I saw an unfamiliar cluster of white lights in the sky.  They looked like stars, so I just assumed I hadn't noticed them before.  But around midnight I noticed that the cluster seemed to have moved slightly from where it was earlier.  I paid close attention to it from midnight until almost 1:00am, and it was moving very slowly across the sky.  From 11:30pm-1:00am, it moved about 5-6 inches in the sky. I spent about an hour on the internet trying to find what this could be - satellites, weather balloon, - but I couldn't find anything.  However, I noticed that the lights were in a similar formation to the Pleiades star cluster.  But I did research on that and I didn't find anything that mentioned the Pleiades star cluster moving. I left around 1:00am, so it could have been there much longer.  I'm going to go out tonight and see if it's there again.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Irregular hexagon with 3 big bright lights emitting beams;2013-10-23 23:38:00;2-3 minutes;Irregular hexagon with 3 big bright lights emitting beams I was outside my home smoking a cigarette at approximately 11:38 three very big bright white lights appeared out of the northern sky moving south east not more then 3 miles from where I was standing.  It came out of no where, flying at no more then an altitude of about 3000 feet.  Each light had about 15 foot beams trailing from each one it appeared to be some mechanism of propulsion every time the it turned they leaned the opposite direction of the turn.  It made an air blowing like noise it came within 1/4 mile of me and my house.  I got a very good look at it once the beams were facing westward when it turned.  The object was flat it was sort of pentagon in shape but not equal lengths, the front where the lights were was a very wide broad point the sides towards the back were at a much narrower angle and much shorte, then a straight line connecting those for the very back.   The object was black except for on the back it was grey- silver like a vent type thing on that straight line back, it moved quite slow actually but in no way resembled a stealth bomber other then the nose of it and its flatness but had no defined wings and a very funky back end.   After passing by my house it proceeded west for about another mile before completely vanishing into thin air.  I searched the sky and could see no other aircraft of any kind in the sky.

Unusually shaped object flying over North Scottsdale.;2016-03-12 22:20:00;20 seconds;Unusually shaped object flying over North Scottsdale. North Scottsdale, Arizona.  My wife and I had been observing the night sky and noticed something strange.  The object was flying from South to North.  We observed the object for about 20 seconds as we watched from the central courtyard of our house the house prevented us from viewing any longer. I’ve seen the international space station fly over before and this was most definitely not the same viewing experience. This object seemed to be in the normal flight path, however, no visible navigation lights and the object was dimly lit, almost bluish.  It was cauliflower shaped and seemed to be tumbling end over end. Approximate altitude was 10-12,000 feet. My wife and I have over 60 years of combined (military and civilian) aviation experience and have not seen anything like this before.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
A shadow moving across mountain peaks which cause could not be determined.;2016-05-29 11:43:00;2-4 seconds;A shadow moving across mountain peaks which cause could not be determined. At about 11:43 on Sunday, May 29, 2016, I observed the following.  There were no clouds from horizon to horizon in any given direction.  The temperature was in the low nineties.  I was in a patrol vehicle at my place of employment traveling in a northern direction and drifting slightly east.  To the north west of my locating about a half a mile away there are some small peaks that are maybe a thousand feet higher in elevation than my location.   These peaks are strung out east to west. I glance at the peaks and saw a round dark shadow that followed the surface contour of the landscape moping from east to west.  I only saw it for a couple of seconds before it passed the most western peak. What was strange about it was that the sun at that time in the morning is almost straight up and the peaks are very close to my location.  I immediately stopped (less than five seconds) and got out of the vehicle looking for an object that may have caused the round shadow, but there was nothing to be seen anywhere in the sky in my general location. There was nothing between the sun and those peaks.  There was nothing moving out of the area heading west as far as the eye could see.  Many miles to the west (about twenty miles) I could see Sky Harbor International traffic along the I-17 corridor flying from north to south, but those shadows would be cast further to the west.  I had seen shadows before across those peaks caused by aircraft but they moved slower and had the definite shape of an aircraft.  This was round and moving very fast.  I estimate the size of the shadow to have been about sixty to eighty feet in diameter. End of Report;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Object sighted, triangular shaped with curved magenta bottom.  Lights moved sequentially from left to right bluish-white with magenta .;2018-04-14 20:30:00;45 seconds;Object sighted, triangular shaped with curved magenta bottom.  Lights moved sequentially from left to right bluish-white with magenta . Scottsdale, AZ 85260 - Near Shea Boulevard and 101 Loop (Highway).                    Approximately 8:30 pm Saturday, April 14th, 2018. At approximately 8:30 pm Saturday, April 14th, 2018 I arrived at my home, parked my car and stepped to the backyard. I am in a neighborhood that is dark, does not have streetlights and the properties are all close to 1 acre plus in size, the night is clear, still has some suspended dust particles in the lower atmosphere/sky that can affect the color like a filter. I unplugged the lights that illuminate a Paolo Verde tree in my backyard.  I looked to the South West and saw the “Belt of Orion” the significantly identifiable constellation that I recall my children always pointing out to me.  I was alone and enjoying the dark sky and the stars straight up and to the north. After seeing the “North Star” as directed by the “Big Dipper’s” outer ladle stars I turned back to view towards the South East and saw a magenta colored object with sequential lights, like a 1970 Ford Thunderbird with its right turn signal on, observed rolling from my left to right moving at a steady swift speed in a Southern and lower trajectory maybe below 10,000 to 15,000 feet. The object seemed to stay on the same altitude in my field of vision. The lights were red and then bright white and the background of the lights lit up in magenta (magenta, somewhere midway between blue and red) it was very pretty and very different.  The lights where arranged in similarity to a shallow bowl, curving upwards and at an apex point above there was a point that was not lit but visible with some opaque connection from the curved lit zone upward to that apex point. The sequential movement of the light created a visual image that made the object seem to be spinning, however it was very quick and this was unlike anything I have seen in the sky before. I witnessed the sighting for about 5 to 10 seconds, then ran into my house and gathered my binoculars which were very close to the screen door to view.  I was excited to view the same outline however, the sequential movement of the lights changed to an “all on” or all illuminated pattern but, the apex point (at the top of the curved bowl shape) and the outline of a structure was more evident. I quickly went back into my house to grab my camera that can zoom and potentially capture an image.  At first because the screen is very small and aligning the camera in the night with a moving object in the sky I didn’t think I captured the image. However, I do have something on the camera. It is very small and only visible for about less than 1.5 seconds.  The camera shows a more blue in color but, I do not have a good way to review the video yet.  On the counter between 6 and 8 seconds, the small spot in the field of view on the top half of the screen shows, what I believe is the moving object described above.  It is very quick and very poor, the larger light was unfortunately one of my solar powered lawn lights.  I am willing to share the video, the sighting in the video is on the higher side of the field of view than the garden light I ended up targeting instead for the remainder of the shoot.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
