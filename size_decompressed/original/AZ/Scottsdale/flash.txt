Flash of white light every 5 seconds moving very slowly from West to East thru The Great Square/Pegusus.;2000-09-19 23:00:00;5 minutes;Flash of white light every 5 seconds moving very slowly from West to East thru The Great Square/Pegusus. Was out doing my nightly star gazing and veiwed in The Great Square / Pegasus a light flashing approximately every 5 seconds.  This flash was moving very slowly and a very high altitude.  The color of the flash was white, and it was moving very slowly from West to East.  I viewed for approximately 5 minutes with both 7x35 and 10x50 binoculars.  It never made it all the way thru The Great Square when it no longer flashed to be visible.  I watch the skys quite a bit and can judge high altitude aircraft speed thru the sky, but this was moving very slowly.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Three  bright blue lights, fading to lighter blue, turning red when changing direction, flashing white when accelerating.;2005-07-04 21:15:00;15 minutes;Three  bright blue lights, fading to lighter blue, turning red when changing direction, flashing white when accelerating. We were on our rooftop to watch the variety of Phoenix and surrounding area firework shows, and got more than we expected. We saw three bright blue lights, fading to lighter blue, turning red when changing direction, flashing white when accelerating. They looked to me to be playing with each other, turning around each other, chasing, diving and floating. At times the were out of sight due to tree tops, and we presumed they might have landed. This was observed facing South from South Scottsdale, they were probably flying over Tempe.  At the time there was flight traffic in the area and fireworks shows.  I have a photo depicting an airplane, the strange lights and  fireworks.  We spotted a fighter jet flying into the area, and the lights hid and remained hidden.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Flash of light in the sky followed by a boom, followed by smoke trails that appear in uneven circles. ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor?  PD));2016-06-02 03:56:00;1 second;Flash of light in the sky followed by a boom, followed by smoke trails that appear in uneven circles. At 3:56am a very bright flash of light was seen in the eastern sky over scottsdale.  Around 5 minutes later a loud bang was heard as if someone was slamming the door inside a house.  I witnessed this inside and the other witness was outside for the noise.  As the sun came up around 4:50am colorful trails that were in uneven circles were seen in the sky.   After checking several outdoor security cameras the light was seen.  Pictures have been taken of the flash and the colorful trails in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Object reported by the news as a probable meteor.  We agree.  See photos of smoky trail left high in the sky above Arizona.  PD));33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
