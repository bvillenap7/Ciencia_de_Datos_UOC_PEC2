Daughter and I saw two round craft forming triangle with North Star, then dancing around eachother and then zoomed off into deep space;1997-03-22 16:00:00;10 minutes;Daughter and I saw two round craft forming triangle with North Star, then dancing around eachother and then zoomed off into deep space My daughter and I were picking up our mail at the mailbox and I noticed that the North Star was very bright and beautiful. I told my daughter to look at the North Star and how low in the sky and beautiful it was. Then out of nowhere, two circular lights formed a perfect isocoles triangle with the North Star and just froze there and held that beautiful formation. Then suddenly they began to dance around eachother with amazing speed and eventually they zoomed off into deep space so fast it was incredible. Then they came back and danced again and then zoomed off into space and were gone. We were stunned. We stopped a jogger to ask him if he saw what we saw and what he thought it was. He said it had to be a UFO of some sort.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Three white circular objects flying in a triangular shape over the skys of Scotsdale, Arizona.;2005-08-22 19:00:00;unknown;Three white circular objects flying in a triangular shape over the skys of Scotsdale, Arizona. When I got back from my vacation in Scotsdale, Arizona and looked at my pictures from my digital camera i was amazed to see three round objects in the sky.   At the time the picture was taken you can see that the sky is extreamly clear with no clounds.   Due to the early evening our the sky is in a darker shade that makes the rounds white objects stand out.   I ignored it at first, but looked awfully suspicious.   The three objects look almost the same and seemes to be flying in the sky in a triangular shape.  My luck to take landskape picture for background on my computer and get the three objects in it too, without even seeing them!!!;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Four lights - looked like the sun.;2006-05-27 13:00:00;3 minutes;Four lights - looked like the sun. Four of us were sitting on our patio at 3 AM when 4 large circular lights appeared and hovered in the Northwest sky.  All four were in a square formation. 2 flickered on and off, disappeared then reappeared.  Then one by one they slowly faded.  Almost immediately after they faded an airplane flew right through the path.  Most bizarre experience of our lives.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
A gigantic red cloud with an inner flickering light was seen hovering over the Scottsdale/Tempe area at 2 am on July 14th, 2008;2008-07-14 02:00:00;10 minutes;A gigantic red cloud with an inner flickering light was seen hovering over the Scottsdale/Tempe area at 2 am on July 14th, 2008 I am writing this report at 2:47 am to report a UFO that i saw over Scottsdale possibly as far south as Tempe.  I live in north Scottsdale and the window where i saw the UFO was facing south.  At about 2 am earlier tonight on July 14th 2008, i went to close my window and i saw what appeared to be a red cloud in the sky hovering over Scottsdale.  Upon closer examination i saw what appeared to be a red inner glowing light and there reddish-orange cloud that surrounded it.  The shape of the cloud was a circle and it flickered with the inner light.  The feeling of seeing that is one that i will never forget.  My heart started to beat rapidly and my mind started racing.   I didn't know whether to wake up my parents or call my friends to check it out. I tried to call a friend of mine, but he did not answer.  I decided not to wake up my parents, because they would have just said i was crazy and told me to go back to sleep.   I didn't want to lose sight of the object either.  Anyway this object just stayed in one spot the whole time, i did not see it fly vertically. The only movement that could have happened was for it to move south, The cloud was strongest in the sky for about 5 minutes and than progressively got less bright over the few minutes. The weird thing was the shape of the cloud didn't get smaller.  It was still huge and it just seemed to get less bright until it vanished. The size was huge, it looked almost as big as a full moon does. In conclusion i want to say that i saw something tonight that i have never seen before in my life.   I am convinced that the object in the sky that i saw was way too big and way too bright to be anything that our military has disclosed.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
100's of star like objects move in a synchronized way across a night sky and slowly disappear, Arizona.;2010-06-05 22:00:00;15 minutes;100's of star like objects move in a synchronized way across a night sky and slowly disappear, Arizona. A large fleet of star like objects, no flickering, were moving at the same speed (VERY SYNCHRONIZED-MOVING AS ONE MASS, this was what astonished me the most)  in a north east direction without formation, some were higher some were lower in the sky.   As we watched it move across the sky they seemed to hit a wall or stop all at the same place in the sky (may have moved away from us) and slowly started to vanish.   Looking through binoculars they seemed to disappear and then above the area where they stop about 10 of the star like objects were left, formed  line in an upward angle.  One of the objects in the middle of the line was brighter and then they slowly disappeared.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

I was so freaked out i didnt know what to do,  As it passed over our car i turned around to see it and looked threw the back window and saw it still gliding at high speeds and then it dissapeared.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

I saw a what appeared to be a  very bright star but was too big  and too round low in eastern sky.had circles inside circles under zoom;2015-09-21 04:30:00;2.5 hours;I saw a what appeared to be a  very bright star but was too big  and too round low in eastern sky.had circles inside circles under zoom At about  4:30 am I witnessed what seemed to be a really bright star looking toward the eastern sky just a little ways above the Mcdowell  mtns.  It was way too bright and too perfectly  round to be a star, so I  got my digital camera with a 36x digital zoom lens and when I zoomed I was completely startled.  It took a little time for me to remember how to use the zoom and get the camera to work correctly as I was seeing on the camera screen what resembled a sort of bright perfectly round object with concentric circles getting smaller as you go towards the center and a solid dot in the middle of this object.  Which by the  way was still shining bright into the morning light while all other stars had disappeared from sight.  There also appeared to be a smaller object that appeared to be spinning with light emitting from it as it  stood out because it was kind of black and it was in different positions  inside the outside edge and in some shots it didnâ€™t appear at all.  I shot  pics for over an hour until my battery ran out and it was day light.  I went inside for another battery and it was gone when I came out.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Three bright orbs dancing in Scottsdale sky;2019-07-04 20:30:00;2 minutes;Three bright orbs dancing in Scottsdale sky I walked outside of my shed in my back yard only to look up and north to see what looked like a shooting star.  It was a round bright ball with a trailing effect behind it.  I then saw two more appear.  They began dancing around the sky in this one area I first saw them.  Moving sporadically and they would disappear and come back.  They appeared to be in a triangle formation moving around from side to side.  They looked to be dancing all with this trail following them across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

UFO sighting, it was large, had multiple lights moving around in a circular motion.;2021-05-22 00:00:00;Hour;UFO sighting, it was large, had multiple lights moving around in a circular motion. Exact time unsure, around noon or midnight. A few friends and I saw a large, much bigger than any plan would be from that distance. About 4-5 people saw it. A clear outline was not noticeable. But there was a number of small lights, moving in a circular motion. All lights where evenly spaced, and would disapear then reappear on the opposite side, of where the lights disappear. It gave it the look of it moving circular. We went back inside after 10 to 15 minutes after sighting it. We went back out to about 30 minutes to a hour later and the UFO was gone. Location was in Scottsdale Arizona. In the area of Thompson Peak, exact zip, unknown.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
