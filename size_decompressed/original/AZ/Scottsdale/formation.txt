the lights were in formation and blinked out one at a time.;2004-04-11 00:12:00;15-20 secs;the lights were in formation and blinked out one at a time. at 0012 hrs on sunday april 11 i went out in my backyard to have a smoke. i'm always looking up at the sky at night because of an interest in astronomy since childhood. something was out of place however in the sky. looking north at 30-35 degrees above the horizon i noticed two lights (white) that were moving in formation and appeared to be traveling southeast by east. their brightness was that of a large satellite or an average size star. at an arms length the formation had about  1 seperation and also at arms length traversed 6 to 9 in the sky. what really made me think something strange was happening was that the trailing or lower light started to twinkle and then went out. the leading or higher light continued to move for another 2 to 3 secs before just blinking out. there was a passenger jet that had taken off from sky harbor airport that was also in the north sky about 2000-3000 ft. and about 1 mile distant. it was heading east and began a slow turn to the north. it is when it first started its turn that the lights i was observing disappeared one by one. i never heard any noise and if i were to guess at a distance for the lights i would say they were 5 to 7 miles. the entire event lasted only 15 to 20 seconds.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
8 light formation traveling straight up South of Phoenix;2004-10-15 20:05:00;15 Minutes;8 light formation traveling straight up South of Phoenix This sighting is from South Scottsdale around Scottsdale Rd. and McDowell. My neighbor was outside on the phone when at approximately 8:05PM, she saw a strange light rising from the horizon. She called me immediately to come out and look at it with her. Looking South by South West, a single white light was traveling straight up from the horizon. While we were watching it, (what seemed to be several miles away), we noticed a second light, then a third until we had counted eight in all. Each subsequent light seemed to be a mile or so behind the one before it. The fifth light in this formation was larger than the rest and glowing red. The sixth light was much closer to the red one than the others, and seemed to be dancing around it. There was a light cloud cover starting at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. We watched until the last light passed behind the clouds. Elapsed time: 10-15 minutes. In doing some research, I found an article about a sighting being called the Estrella Lights (West Metro Phoenix Area, June 14th, 8:40PM) which is similar, but in this sighting, the lights were in a horizontal configuration and much closer together but did have a red light in the midst of the formation.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

3 Blinking Lights in Loose Formation over Camelback Mountain, Phoenix;2008-04-29 23:55:00;1 hour;3 Blinking Lights in Loose Formation over Camelback Mountain, Phoenix I was sitting on the porch having a smoke when I noticed two twinkling lights off to the west. They had to be over Camelback Mountain (8 miles away), or maybe further west towards Glendale, it all depended on their altitude. They were in an area of the night sky that was void of stars, probably due to pollution. This is why I knew they did not belong there.  Upon further visual exploration of the scene, I noticed a third twinkling light at a lower altitude. The three would get brighter and move around a bit, but they would stay in the same general area. Sometimes they would dim to the point that they were impossible to see, only to brighten and twinkle once more. They did not move for nearly an hour, after which time tiredness dectated that I go to sleep.  Forty five minutes into watching these lights, or around 12:45, there was what I deemed to be an aircraft with a bright red flashing light, maybe a helicopter, that flew past all three of these objects. It should also be noted that these objects were present before I noticed them, and they probably lasted after I went to bed. I am writing this report after having come inside from watching the event.  I am visiting family for the week, and am leaving tomorrow. I did hear of a 'second round' of Phoenix Lights that took place a week ago (4/21/08)on the news last week. I think these lights behaved similarly to the ones I saw on many local news stations, however, they did not change positions such as the ones from a week ago, the lights tonight were relatively stationary.

Scottsdale sighting against air traffic;2008-11-18 21:42:00;25 sec;Scottsdale sighting against air traffic We were sitting on our outside porch when we saw it come from the horizon moving rapidly. One circle of light broke formation flying irradically while the others stayed in perfect formation. Thee objects broke from straight path and darted to our left the irradic circle rejoined formaion than it just dissappeared. The objects were flying against air traffic from the scottsdale airport as well. Theres was no sound. My father worked for TWA for 37 years, and I have my private pilots license also I was in the military I know what planes look like and that was nothing i have ever seen in the sky before.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Unfamilar orange lights in North Scottsdale;2008-11-19 21:40:00;20 secs;Unfamilar orange lights in North Scottsdale I was sitting on the balcony when a seven lighted object came from the north west. It was in an arrow formation and it flew directly at us.  One broke formation on the bottom right, it veared off in a different path to the right.  The formation then turned to the left heading south.  The stray light rejoined formation again and then they all disappeared.  In all it took less than 30 secs.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Lights in formation seen over freeway.;2014-11-30 18:45:00;15 minutes;Lights in formation seen over freeway. I saw 4-5 lights in a straight line hovering over the 101 freeway in Scottsdale.  At first I thought it was helicopters, but then I realized there were no flashing lights.  Then one by one they went straight up into the sky and disappeared.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
4 lights seen in a formation.;2016-03-02 19:00:00;7 minutes;4 lights seen in a formation. The object was in a triangle light formation with an additional light on the side.  The formation did not move for the duration I observed.  There were four bright circular lights, and they were relatively close together.  I first noticed the lights after exiting the 101 and going down Frank Lloyd Wright.  My mom pulled over into a residential area to take pictures.  I've been watching the skies, and keeping track of anything out of the ordinary.  Last year on March 4, 2015, a single light was hovering in the same spot for 45 minutes.  I am unsure about the correlation between this incident and the previous one from last year, but I couldn't disregard the possible connection due to the fact that it was around the same date and time.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
