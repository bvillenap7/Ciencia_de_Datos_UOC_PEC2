It then moved to the south eastern sky where it remained static for approximately two hours. The object emitted brilliant white, blue, and red lights which appeared to flash in sequence. As an aerospace worker with more than 20 years experience in fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, I determined the object was not conventional. It remained in a static position for two hours and emitted no sound. As I had no optical devices, such as binoculars, I could not confirm its true shape. I can confirm that the lights observed with the naked eye were aligned horizontally and appeared to flash or pulse in a left to right sequence. My observations were confirmed by my teenage son who likewise witnessed the event. I placed calls to the local airport and television newsroom to inquire if there had been other reports. There were none made.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Cigar shaped object over the McDowell Mountains;2006-05-26 05:00:00;20 min;Cigar shaped object over the McDowell Mountains On the morning of May 26th 2006 my 16 year old son and I were headed to my mom's house to give her a ride to the airport, it was 5:00 AM barely getting day light still dark enough that I had my headlights on, we were going east on Cactus Road just west of Tatum Blvd. when my son noticed a strange light in the eastern sky I looked out and saw that it was just over the McDowell Mountains and appeared to be the shape of an L and was a bright orange, there was not a cloud in the sky and I was trying to see if it was something that the sun might be reflecting on but other than the object itself the skies were clear, we watched it as it seemed to remain stationary for about 2 minutes then just disappeared, well I continued East bound when just slightly to the North of the first sighting was a very long cigar shaped object same color bright orange lights as the first object again appearing to be stationary then suddenly started moving slowly east toward the valley in  between the peaks of the mountain. Well by now I had pulled over and we had gotten out of the car when remembering that I had a camera on my cell phone and it was better than nothing I was scrambling to find it in the bottom of my purse, but it was too late as the object started to really move rapidly and just as I raised the phone to take a picture of it  the tail end of it disappeared behind the peak of the mountain. I called a couple of news stations to see if it may have been reported by anyone else and apparently it had not, I also got on the internet to look up photos of other sightings around the world and I did find a couple that look exactly like the one we saw. I'm just happy I wasn't alone and had another witness with me.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
