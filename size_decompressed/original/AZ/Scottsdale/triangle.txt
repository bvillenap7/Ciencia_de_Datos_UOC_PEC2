PHOENIX LIGHT OVER SCOTTSDALE IN 1991;1990-06-30 20:30:00;10 MINUTES;PHOENIX LIGHT OVER SCOTTSDALE IN 1991 I HAVE WITHOUT A DOUBT & SWEAR ON MY LIFE & THE LIFE OF MY FAMILY, THAT I TOO HAVE SEEN THESE LIGHTS AND IT CHILLS ME EVERYTIME I SEE A REPORTING ABOUT THEM.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE TO MY STORY IS THAT THE DATE THAT I HAVE SEEN THEM IS ABOUT 4 YEARS PRIOR TO YOUR SIGHTING.  I HAVE SEARCHED FOR DATES ONLINE BUT HAVE SEEN NOTHING DURING THIS TIME.  NOW AS A RESULT OF MY FINDINGS, I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO TELL SOMEBODY.  I JUST CANT BELIEVE NOBODY ELSE HAS REPORTED THESE LIGHTS DURING THAT TIME PERIOD BECAUSE WHAT I SAW WAS ENORMOUS! HOW COULD ANYBODY MISS IT?  CURRENTLY, I RESIDE IN SARASOTA, FLORIDA, BUT FOR A BRIEF TIME, FROM 1990-1991, I LIVED IN SCOTTSDALE, AZ.  AND FROM 1992 TO 2004 I LIVED IN THE FAR NORTH SUBURBS OF CHICAGO.  I WAS AT THE CORNER OF SCOTTSDALE ROAD AND E. SHEA BLVD. AT THE NE CORNER OF THE INTERSECTION IS/WAS A MOBILE  ((sic.  Mobil)) GAS STATION.  WHILE I WAS FILLING UP MY CAR WITH GAS, I SAW THESE RED LIGHTS IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING IN A V SHAPE IN WHAT LOOKED VERY CLOSE AND MOVING VERY SLOWLY!!! BECAUSE THE AREA SITS AT SORT OF A HIGHER ELEVATION OVERLOOKING THE PHOENIX, TEMPE & MESA AREAS, THE LIGHTS SEEMED ALMOST EYE LEVEL.  YOU DID LOOK UP SLIGHTLY BUT THESE LIGHTS SEEMED NO MORE THAN ABOUT 1 MILE AWAY IN DISTANCE AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT A HALF A MILE LONG OR LONGER IN SIZE.  THE OBJECT MOVED IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION AND MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND WHAT-SO-EVER. THE FACT THAT IT HAD NO SOUND IS WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.  I HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF AMBER LIGHTS, WHICH I DON’T BELIEVE IS WHAT I SAW.  I BELIEVE I SAW RED LIGHTS.  ALSO, I HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF FLARES. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT I SAW.  THIS MAINTAINED A CONSTANT ELEVATION IN A VERY SLOW EASTERLY DIRECTION.  I WAS IN SO MUCH DISBELIEF THAT I DIDN’T HEAR ANYBODY ELSE AROUND ME MAKING COMMENTS THAT I HAD TO ASK AN OLDER GENTLEMAN, WHOME WAS WALKING OUT OF THE GAS STATION AFTER PAYING I ASSUME, IF HE KNEW WHAT THOSE LIGHTS WERE.  HE DID SORT OF A DOUBLE TAKE, ANSWERED, I DON’T KNOW, PROCEEDED TO GET IN HIS CAR STARING AT THE LIGHTS AND DROVE OFF. I WAS ABOUT 23 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME, AND I REMEMBER THINKING, WELL IF HE DIDN’T THINK IT WAS ANY BIG DEAL, THEN IT MUST NOT BE, SO I PROCEEDED TO GET IN MY CAR AND LEAVE TO GO TO MY GIRLFRIENDS HOUSE AT THE TIME IN MCCORMICK RANCH.  I THINK I KEPT AN EYE ON THE LIGHTS FOR A WHILE AS I WAS DRIVING BUT AFTER THAT I CAN’T REMEMBER WHEN I STOPPED LOOKING.  I REMEMBER TELLING MY GIRLFRIEND ABOUT IT WHEN I WALKED IN HER HOUSE AND SHE CHANGED THE SUBJECT AND I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING ON THE NEWS THAT EVENING ABOUT IT, SO IT WAS FORGOTTEN UNTIL ABOUT 1997 WHEN I SAW THE FIRST REPORTS OF THE LIGHTS ON TELEVISION.  I REMEMBER SEEING THE REPORTS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND FEELING THE HAIR STAND UP ON THE BACK OF MY NECK. I WONDERED, NOW HOW DO I TELL SOMEBODY MY STORY WITHOUT THEM THINKING THAT I AM NUTS?  WELL, I NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT MUCH BUT, I TOLD MY FUTURE WIFE AND I RECEIVED THE TYPICAL RESPONSE I GUESS ANY CRACK POT MIGHT GET, OH, COOL OR THAT’S NICE.  SO AGAIN, I PUSHED IT ASIDE.  BUT IT IS REALLY EATING AT ME NOW TO TELL SOMEBODY.  SO HERE I AM.  I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANY FINANCIAL GAIN OR RECOGNITION.  I JUST WANTED AN EAR TO HEAR MY SIDE.

2002 submission of March 13th mass UFO sightings over Phoenix;1997-03-13 00:00:00;:40 minutes;2002 submission of March 13th mass UFO sightings over Phoenix At 2220 hours, Arizona time, myself and 3 oter witnesses sighted what we initially thought was an inbound formation of airplanes in the vicinity of Cave Creek, AZ.  Even initially, it was an exciting event.  This was a huge object.  Following a precise course and maintaining an exact altitude, this craft intercepted Scottsdale Road, made good a southerly heading until approximately Indian School road, turned over Sky Harbor Airport and eventually disappeared in the vicinity of South Mountain.  As the craft approached, we began to eliminate what it wasn't.  Not airplanes, helicopters, blimps etc.  It's speed was estimated at 40--50 mph.  It was titally silent.  It featured large amber lights on the leading edge with some smaller lights underneath, some on the side (left from our vantage point) and some visible aft.   As it passed 90 degrees and aprx 1 1/2 mile, we thought we could see substance to it, i.e, blocking out lights behind it  but transparent at the same time.  I estimated it's altitude to be 10,000 feet at the iniitial contact, roughly the same altitude as inbound air traffic bound for PHX... as it passed, the lower portion of the craft was an estimated 200 feet from the ground.  Note: There was nothing to compare this machine to, so size, etc. could be quite different.  I am a retired airline pilot, have flown for 40+ years, have flown everything from the J-3 Cub to the 747.  I retired as a 727 Captain for one of the big 4. I have never seen anything like this - not even close.  The assertion that this craft was flares is a pathetic attempt at coverinvg up the truth.  I have no idea what it was, but definitely know what it was not.  Flares do not maintain altitude, nor navigate a precise course.  The sighting/s are well known at this point, and have been the subject of many TV documentaries, etc.  Yet, no word is forthcoming.  The paripherial events surrounding the sightings are nothing less than erie.  Unfortunately, this and other events are falling into obscurity because we as a society! are all owing that to happen.  I am happy to discss this with anyone.  Be advised I am NOT seeking any publicity, etc.  Since reporting this sighting, long time friends look at me with a jaundiced eye, strangers who hear the story often think I'm crazy, etc.  On this the 5th anniversary of the Phoenix Lights the image is fresh in my mind.  This did happen.  Had the comet not been in the skies that evening, I doubt we would have seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  This report is submitted by a retired airline captain, who had accumulated 13,700 hours of flight time at the time of his sighting, and who is well known to NUFORC.   He is well known in the Phoenix area, and he has been one of the more visible, and vocal, witnesses with regard to the dramatic Phoenix Lights sighting of 13MR97.

I hope it's ours !  If not, it's definately 'someone else's'... (and FOR SURE, it's not of human origin) !;1997-03-13 19:00:00;30 min;I hope it's ours !  If not, it's definately 'someone else's'... (and FOR SURE, it's not of human origin) ! I just found this web site and decided to enter what I KNOW I SAW the evening of 3/17/97 (like so many others did that night in the Phoenix sky). I was gardening in the back yard of my Scottsdale home. I noticed 8 or 9 soft glowing amber lights in the sky approaching me from the south in a V shaped (flying wing) formation. The 'flying wing object' gradually flew 'directly over' my home (in the course of about 5 minutes) at a perceived altitude of about 500 feet (about the same height of near-by Thompson Peak Mt. of the McDowell Mountains) at a speed 'I thought to be' about 40 MPH. The object was like a dark shadow (rather than a solid aircraft) and emminated a deep, soft, quiet, vibrating tone (like an electric turbine generator). I was stunned (in awe) and just watched it pass (as it veered slightly WNW). From that evening until now, ALL reports made by ALL witnesses have been discounted / unexplained by ALL governmental entities... *even though Sky Harbor air traffic control reported its unexplained existence in the Phoenix metro area that evening. I am well skilled in matters of aviation AND not convinced (either way) in matters of extra-terastrial 'whatever', BUT what I saw was not 'unidentified'... *It was awesome and real... and it WAS NOT (I know for sure) 'of ANY earthling's doing'. ** A difficult thing to assess (from one who STILL doubts life exists anywhere else in our universe... close enough to travel here at the speed of light in a time frame of a million years or more). Of mention... I have had two other similar experiences (that are not of human cause). I assure you. They were 'real' too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Myself, my 12 yr old son and his friend watched a large triangular shape craft with colored lights (red mostly) in chevron design glide;1997-03-13 20:15:00;5 min;Summary : Myself, my 12 yr old son and his friend watched a large triangular shape craft with colored lights (red mostly) in chevron design glide over my house very slowly and completely silent.  We watched it as it headed south for quite a long time.  The ship was very large, flying very low and totally silent.I cannot understand why there is not more coverage and concern regarding this sighting.  I always believed there could be other life out there - now I know;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Dark triangular shape against the darking sky. The object had great speed and no sound or light was evident.;1999-01-28 06:30:00;2-4 sec;Dark triangular shape against the darking sky. The object had great speed and no sound or light was evident. Over the past few days 1-25-99 until yesterday 1-31-99 I've seen some interesting things in the sky over north Scottsdale in AZ. I wont speculate on what I saw but I will provide this brief explanation. The rear balcony of my 2nd story apartment faces east - north/east overlooking Stone Creek Golf coarse so I've a very clear view with little or no obstruction. The other day I was relaxing on my balcony just enjoying the sky as I am an amateur astronomer. Then I saw a streak in the sky low on the horizon about 10 degrees. This streak was black against the darkening sky, and triangular in shape. The time was around 6:30 pm and the sky was turning a deep low saturation purple as is does here in the desert. The shape almost reminded me of an orderly flock of birds but it was clearly not birds as the speed was way to great and there was no variation in its shape, it was solid. The object covered at least 45 degrees horizontally in about 2 seconds. I estimate the object to be approximatly 2 to 4 miles distant making it quite large about the size of an f-15 or larger. At first I thought this is what I must have seen but there were no lights and no reflected light the only way I saw the object was due to the fact that it obscured the darkening sky. The sky was dark but the object was much darker. There was no sound and what seemed to be a dark streak or trail behind the object. I noticed that I could more clearly see the object by not looking directly at it. As all astronomers know when looking at very faint objects it is best to not look directly at the object due to the make up of the human eye, rods and cones. I've a very clear understanding of aircraft, speed, size and action. Just to the north east of me is the Scottsdale Airpark, an airport that can handle many types of jets up to small passenger jets. It is a very busy airport and at any time you can see 4 to 6 jets on approach from the north. I know how fast a leer jet looks as it takes off and lands and this object was approximately 5 times that. Well after this first sighting a couple days ago I didn't give it much more thought, I don't need to dwell on such things as I've seen many unexplained things in the sky. Well yesterday I saw  2 more such objects in the same place at the same time with 2 friends who also saw something. This time I saw the object for a good 90 degrees horizontally it was not quite as dark so I could see it more clearly. This occurred just after the full moon had cleared the mountains in the distance. Again there was no sound and the shape was triangular. I saw one and then within a few seconds another one. I could clearly point at it and follow it across the sky telling my friends as it crossed various reference points such as houses and the moon. I'll be watching the desert skies at dusk in that area everyday now with my camcorder in hand.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Non-moving lights in the southwestern sky.;1999-11-16 17:30:00;10 minutes;Non-moving lights in the southwestern sky. There was a grouping of red lights, not blinking and not moving, southwest of Scottsdale.  They were kind of in a half triangle, and if looking directly west, the lights were at about 20 degrees.  It was too far away to tell if it was actually an object or not.  But while I was looking through the binoculars, the lights went out, one by one. There was no sound, and the object looked to be west of Phoenix. I don't drink or smoke, and I'd never do drugs, so I know I wasn't imagining things.  I'm not a believer in UFOs, but ((name of investigator deleted)) convinced me to write to this website.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

My wife and I were watching a movie on TV when we saw 3 very bright lights in the southern sky over Phoenix.  The 3 lights were in a triangle pattern, 1 on top and two on the bottom.  The bottom left light went out first for about 10 seconds whle the other two remained on.  Then it came back on.  Then 2 of the lights went out at exactly the same time for about ten seconds and they reappeared.  The the lower left light went out again and did not come back on.  Finally the other two lights went out and they did not reappear. While this was going on we saw a normal size commercial airplane heading for the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport in the distance, but it was very SMALL in size compared to the triangle we witnessed. We saw the 3 lights from the inside of our home and then proceeded into our backyard and stil saw them.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Saw silent, triangular craft at early twilight that was almost blended with the sky background.;2001-11-16 16:23:00;30 seconds;Saw silent, triangular craft at early twilight that was almost blended with the sky background. I stepped out behind our house after dinner to get something out of our storage shed.  pon leaving the shed, I glanced up at the sky as I locked the shed door. The sky was clear.  It was early twilight.  Almost directly overhead was a triangular shaped craft.  completely quiet.  The triangle would be roughly a 70 - 70 - 40 degree triangle with the apex of the 40 degree angle apparently the front of the craft.  The apex of the nose was blunt as if the front few feet were removed.  It left a distinct triangle with a square front end.  Along each edge (left and right) was a defined area that was slightly lighter extening front to back and possibly 8 to 10 feet wide.  In essence, it looked like two stripes, one along each edge of the triangle (but not the back edge).  Set in each of the stripes and spaced equidistant from each other and within the area of the stripe were circles that looked like dull dome lamps.  The circles were perhaps 6 to 8 feet in diameter.  I believe there were 5 along each edge.  I don't recall if there were these circles along the rear edge or not. In the area between the two edge stripes and starting perhaps half-way back from the leading edge of the craft was an area that appeared to be somewhat darker than the rest of the craft.  It was uniform in color but only a part of a shade darker.  The curious thing here is that while I've described a craft with stripes and lights, it was very pale against the twilight sky.  I don't believe that I would have seen it if I hadn't just by luck looed straight at where it was.  The color was almost the color of th sky with just a little difference.  The overall shape, the stripe area, the large circular lights were definite shapes but the color was so weak as to be almost blended with the ambient image of the sky.  There was no sound.  I waited and listened closely for several seconds to see if I could perceive sound.  There was none. I live next to a little league ball field.  The field lighting was on.  I almost believe that reflected light ! from the field was what enabled me to see this thing.  From a size standpoint, there is no way to know.  If the visual cues from other aircraft I know are valid, and if the altitude was from 1500 to maybe 2000 feet, then the craft was about 120 feet long and 50 or 60 feet wide at the back.  If that was valid, then I would estimate the speed at around 100 to 150 knots.  If the size cues were wrong, then the actual size could be anything.  We live onthe edge of an extended traffic pattern for Scottsdale Airport.  It was curious that the craft had no  beacon or anticollision lights.  That makes me believe that it should have been much higher than I think because of the danger of collision in an airport traffic pattern. I don't recall the altitude requirements to cross over the airport control space but I think it's around 7500 feet.  If the craft was at that altitude it would have been enormous andwould have been moving at perhaps 300 or 400 knots.  I'm a former military pilot.  I know aircraft.  My distance vision is excellent.  I've never seen anything like this before.  I can say what it wasn't.  It was no known aircraft in the inventory of any country I'm aware of.  It was not a hang glider, an ultra-light, baloon, F11, B2, Beechcraft Starship, Dick Rutan creaation, or anything else I can think of.  It was not shaped like a blimp and besides, you can hear them easily.  I watched the craft for approximately 10 seconds until it disappeared behind a tree that blocked my vision.  It held a steady course, altitude, and speed - traveling from southeast to northwest.  I have filed a report with MUFON some time ago.  I just found out about your group today on the radio.

Black Triangle with three bright lights, over highway 101 in Scottsdale area.;2005-03-21 00:17:00;15 secconds;Black Triangle with three bright lights, over highway 101 in Scottsdale area. At 00:17 I was driving north on the 101, near Thomas I think. There was a hospital exit sign that I passed during the time I saw the object, and I was in the center lane. I saw what at first appeared to be three spotlights, maybe from 3 police helicopters, except brighter and flying in perfect symmetrical formation. They got bigger, brighter, and farther apart as they seemed to descend to 1000ft or so over the highway while moving East. At this point I decided that these were one object, and the space that would make up the triangle between the lights seemed darker than the sky. Each side seemed about the same as the width of both lanes of the highway. At the point that I decided that this was not natural, and not typical aircraft. the lights had gotten brighter and the object started to climb in altitude while still heading east. It accelerated quickly, and at the same time the lights dimmed to black. Like it smoothly popped out of existence. I have worked with Boeing at both commercial and military sites for about 10 years, and seen many funky aircraft. This was not one of them. There were other cars on the road also, and they had to have seen this.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
I observed three bright white lights arranged in a triangular pattern hovering low in the northeast sky;2005-03-21 12:20:00;3 minutes;On 3/21/05 at approximately 12:20 p.m.,I observed three bright white lights arranged in a triangular pattern hovering low in the northeast sky. The sky was clear and there were no other aircraft observed near the sighting area. At the initial time of the sighting I was driving northbound on a dimly lit street. At the next intersection I turned eastbound toward the area where the formation appeared to be hovering about 500 feet above a nearby church structure. As I proceeded closer to the formation it abruptly disappeared from view. Due to my distance from the formation, I could not further verify the existence of structural details.

((Apparent report of helicopter. PD)Loud hovering object with red and green lights over McDowell Mt. Ranch Subdivision in N Scottsdale.;2005-10-04 04:00:00;1 1/2 hrs.;Loud hovering object with red and green lights over McDowell Mt. Ranch Subdivision in North Scottsdale. I was awakened by a loud hovering noise around 4:00 am and after listening awhile, I went out back and saw the lights of a strange vehicle....at first I thought it was a police helicopter. The light that ended up being the front was green with sometimes a red light joining it.  The lights at the other end were red and white. The red lights kept circling in a triangle pattern and occassionally a small white light went off like a flash bulb. Once while in back, it emitted a white searchlight type of signal aimed my direction, but no rays or beams from the light. It hovered in the canyon behind my house for about an hour, making that loud noise. Then it hovered off to the West, hovered for awhile longer, directed that while light my direction again, then went way up in the sky. The green light seemed to be the front end when it left. It really made a LOUD hovering noise, much louder than a helicopter noise. ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS:  I just reported a sighting, then called the Police Dept. who said that it WAS one of their helicopters.  So please disregard my report.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

My eye's fixed on what looked like 3 stars, and I realized they were moving, and they were moving towards us.  The neighborhood that we live in is thickly populated but there were no other people near by at the moment.  We were at the corner of Granite reef and heatherbree in Scottsdale, AZ.  I was looking west, when I first noticed these lgihts(stars),  As they got closer, they must of been part of one craft, because thier movements seemed to be dependent upon each other.  I told the kids to look and they saw it too.  just about as it got over our heads it started turning towards the south, and elevating.  at what seemed like the point were it started elevating it wobbled for a sec or two, and then shot off and up to the south.

Gilbert;2005-10-31 19:00:00;10 mins;Gilbert Craft came from the west I was on the corner of McKenzie and Granite Reef with my two girls.  Craft came from the west and first appeared as 1 star, then 2 & 3.  Some how I focused on it and realized all three stars were moving in unison and coming right at me?    Eventually it was right over head, and turned 90* to the south.  As it was approaching me it was dropping in elevation, until it seemed like it was relatively very low and over head.  Then as it turned south, it seemed to try to elevate again?  As it tried to elevate it wobbled.  Finally it shot off at a high rate of speed, but seemed to stop about 15 - 20 miles to the south at that point it seemed to drop out of sight. One of my girls didn't bring her glasses, so she couldn't see it, my other daughter ((name deleted)) saw it rise and go to the south.  It was silent and seemed to have definition but I really couldn't make out anything but the 3 lights.  It did black out the sky I think, but it was impossible to see where its edge stopped and started?  It went both slow and fast, but the wobble tells me it's human made, Alien craft would be flawless... I have also seen other UFO type objects, both at night and in the day in AZ..  I filmed a UFO 05-06-2011 seen in Surprise and Gold Canyon AZ.  This seen twice that day with a witness also.

On Halloween Night 2005, 3 Lights in shape of a triangle moving over Scottsdale, AZ.;2005-10-31 19:30:00;2:00min;On Halloween Night 2005, 3 Lights in shape of a triangle moving over Scottsdale, AZ. Well walking up Granite Reef, about 1/4 mile north of Indian School, with my 2 youngest daughters I saw what I thought was 3 stars in the shape of a triangle far off in the western sky.  Something about them caught my attention, and then I realized it was that they were moving towards us, all at once, together, as one it seemed.  I watched them for a few mins until I was sure of what I was seeing, then I told my daughters to look up and they saw them/it too.  They slowly came almost directly over our heads, and as they got near to us they started to bank and turn towards the south.  I didn't realize it at first but as they got closer to us they were also descending. I could see any edge or shape to this craft, but it was blocking out the view of the sky and stars behind it as it moved...  As it straightened out towards the south after making the turn, it wobbled once or twice and then shot off to the south 3 to 5 miles (estimate), also elevating as it moved, and then just stopped.  It covered this distance in the blink of an eye, but it also seemed like maybe who ever or what ever was controlling this thing, wasn't having the results they wanted.  The Movement was somewhat erratic and unstable.  Changing elevation and direction and stopping and going, and that wobble before it moved quickly to the south, just didn't seem as controlled as something that could move that fast and that quite should be.  I don't know what it was, but I have never seen a plane or helicopter that could move like that and not make a sound.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

I saw what looked like the Stealth Bomber tonight, but with a lot of leading edge lights (7 to 10 total) the rest of the craft was pitch black, blacker than the sky. The sky is absolutely clear (it just happened about an hour ago). It was perfectly silent. I could not tell whether it was a small object close to me, or a large object far away. I was in a parking lot of apartments, so only the sky above me was in view. It was heading Northwest, in a perfectly straight line, at a slow to medium pace. The lights never blinked, and were not very bright. First time I have seen anything unexplained.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

I had the windows down, there was no sound.   It seemed to hover for awhile then started to gain speed and disappeared over the mountains in our area.

Me and my two young sons were leaving on a bike to home.  I was fixing the bike seat so my older of the two sons could ride the younger one home, as I was going to walk besides them.   I looked up and saw two lights floating by, seems close to the ground.  I walked over couple of feet and saw it was a triangle, black, quiet, floating straight north.  I told my boys to look and they started yelling and saying what is that?  I began yelling to, hoping someone would come out to see it.   The lights were small and white on the ends of the side that was facing us.  I told my youngest to run inside the house to get my nephew to see it.  He tried to run, but fell.  By the time my nephew came out, it went draught into the clouds.   I was excited, but my son's began to shake terriblely.  And one even threw up from being so scared of what we had just seen. It took about 3-4 minutes for it to be a field away from us to get into the clouds about 8 miles away. It was low, no noise. I'm in shock.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Huge fire orange objects over Phoenix.;2017-01-28 18:30:00;5 minutes;Huge fire orange objects over Phoenix. Leaving our house in the mountains of Scottsdale with a view of the city, my wife said oh my god what is that?  There were three huge diamond shaped lights in the sky that were fire orange.  They had two smaller white lights flanking the side.   They suddenly changed formation and disappeared.    They were 10x the size of commercial jets landing at Sky Harbor which we have a view of.   Oddly enough, my office is by the Scottsdale Airport and there were many (f18’s – not exactly sure) on the tarmac all week, which is odd because there are very few military planes there ever (I have worked close to that airport for over 20 years and have only seen military aircraft for air-shows.)

They were moving too quickly to be planes, and I saw one get lower and lower to the ground and then just disappear.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

They were hovering, made no sound and stayed in place while I was watching them for about 2 minutes.  I took my eyes off them for a second and when I looked back, they disappeared and I could not locate them again.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
