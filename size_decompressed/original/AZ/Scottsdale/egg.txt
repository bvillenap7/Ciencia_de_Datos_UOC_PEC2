Bright orange marble sized fireball/orb.;2014-06-08 19:34:00;3 minutes;Bright orange marble sized fireball/orb At precisely 7:34 pm, I left my home, and began to walk to a nearby convenient store.  The second I turned, and began to walk down the street, (was walking east), I saw a large fire orange colored object, it basically looked like a giant fireball, or a miniature sun, but was slightly off from a perfect sphere.   I knew immediately it wasn't a plane, a star, or a planet, because of its size and distinct orange hue.  It was about the size of a marble.  I couldn't tell exactly how far away it was, but it appeared to be inside the atmosphere at least, not in space.  It was moving very very slowly, straight down.   I did manage to capture about a minute and a half of it, but on my cellphone the quality isn't great.   I thought it might had been a missile of some sort at the time so I was kind of panicked, and since it was moving down, my camera is shaky for some of the footage because I am walking, so I don't lose sight of it.   The sky wasn't even fully dark at the time so you can tell even in this bad footage that this object shouldn't be there, its just too bright, even on my cellphone camera.   At the end of the footage you can see it begin to blink, it did this several times before shrinking into a much much smaller, yellow sphere.   It still followed its path straight down, until it passed the tree and building line, and I lost sight of it. I wish I had better footage, or more information, but...   That's all I've got.  Oh I also forgot to add the object was dead silent.  Shortly after the event, I saw multiple unmarked planes fly in that direction, not all together, but one at a time, about every 30 seconds to a minute apart.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
