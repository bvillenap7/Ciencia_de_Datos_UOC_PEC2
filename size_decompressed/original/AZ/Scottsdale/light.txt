Bright light takes off into the skys over Scottsdale, AZ in 1987;1987-03-15 03:00:00;three minuets;Bright light takes off into the skys over Scottsdale, AZ in 1987 My brother and I were on the way to go bass-fishing early in the morning to Bartlett Lake.  Just outside Scottsdale, AZ we seen a light, VERY BRIGHT, behind a desert mountain, and it lit up the background of the mountain so bright it lit up the entire area.  We both said, Holly ****, and tried to say that is MUST be just a helicopter taking off behind the mountain, and there MUST be an airport there, so we hit the odometer on the truck and continued to drive slowly down the road.  The light started to get brighter, and brighter, and in an INSTANT the light (WHITE IN COLOR) shot straight up into the sky, and defied all laws of gravity as it streaked across the sky as fast as a shooting star, but it went UP, and after a ways, then turned right (horizontal). My brother and I couldn't believe our eyes?  We did continue on the the lake. (Bartlett Lake, AZ), near Horseshoe Lake, and fished the morning and afternoon.  On the way home we decided to stop and get out where we set the odometer, and we were still MILES FROM TOWN!  As we noticed in the daylight the mountain that was lit up earlier that morning could be seen as we drove back to Scottsdale. There was NO AIRPORT, and there was NO Buildings, or houses for MILES.  We decided NOT to tell anyone as we feared we would be called CRAZY or that we MADE IT UP?  I only now tell this to whoever reads this, so maybe SOMEONE ELSE seen the same thing back then?  Maybe this happened and was REPORTED BACK THEN? The date is approximate, as years have gone by, but I am sure it was the spring time, and I am SURE of the time in the morning!  We never saw a SHAPE of a craft, but the size of light was beyond belief!  We both had been in helicopters and airplanes, and had seen them in the air at night MANY TIMES BEFORE? This was something else?  I hope this may be confirmed by other witnesses?  We would like to KNOW if what we saw was truly a UFO?  We both know it was NOT FROM THIS EARTH? Thank you for listening. OH, it made NO SOUND. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Not the Phoenix Lights, but the Scottsdale Lights.;1997-03-13 20:00:00;45;Not the Phoenix Lights, but the Scottsdale Lights. My journey started near Greenway road and 56th street at around 8pm.  It was dark outside on March 13, 1997.  I needed to head out to CompUSA which was located near Scottsdale Road and Shea Blvd.  I was heading north on 56th street and I made a left on Shea Blvd which had me heading east towards Scottsdale road.  As I was driving east on Shea, when I got to about 60th Place, I noticed a couple lights coming around on the east side of the McDowell mountains on my left.  They were higher the peak of the mountain which is 3,900 feet, my estimate would be somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 feet. As I drove to about 64th street, I noticed about 4 lights spaced at what I would estimate about a 1 or 2 blocks apart.  My immediate thoughts were these are some military helicopters because the speed they were travel was way to slow compared to airplanes.  Scottsdale Airpark is right in the same area and I’ve seen hundreds of planes coming in and out of that airport and none ever flown in that formation.  And I would not say commercial airplanes because none have every flown in that direction either. I kept looking out to the left out my window and counted about 7 lights now.  All evenly spaces and was in kind of an arch, like the arch of an old fashion bow.  Totally strange to me because I have never seen any lights like this before, so I was excited to think it was a convoy of military helicopters. When I made it to my destination and got out of my car, I looked up and watched the lights come and pass right over me.  2 of the 7 lights went right over my head.  When they went over, I heard ZERO sounds.  Just a light that sputtered and it was completely black around the lights.   I watched as the 3 light went over and in my head, I said this is really strange because I hear NOTHING.  The lights traveled very slowly.  I waited more than 5 minutes in the parking lot for the first light to travel over and then probably 3 to 5 minutes for the second light. I headed into the store and did my shopping.  Never once did I think of it as a UFO.  I used to watch XFiles at that time and didn’t think of taking a picture.  I was thinking they were silent helicopters that ran about a mile or more in length.   After about 20 to 30 minutes in the store, I came out and the lights were gone. It wasn’t for a day or two later when I heard the news and it made me think different about what I saw.  The strange part, these lights were in northeast Scottsdale.  Not southwest Phoenix like the Phoenix lights were reported and known for. This event, these lights are burned into my memory like it was yesterday.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Emerging, pivoting array of lighted objects.;2000-01-04 20:30:00;10 seconds;Emerging, pivoting array of lighted objects. I am filing this report on behalf of my son who witnessed the event.  At about 20:30 on January 4, 2000, (est.), my son was in the vicinity of Jomax Rd. and 62nd St. looking toward the south at the lights of Phoenix in the distance.  The day had been overcast with some rain, which had stopped in the evening.   A light at the extreme right side of his field of view caused him to look in that direction, west.  He witnessed a vivid green circular object descending at about a 30 degree angle, the object was the size of a dime at arms length.   At a height of about 200 feet above the ground the object stopped and a second identical object then appeared as if out of the first and proceeded on the same path and speed until it was about 12 diameters from the first, then it too stopped.   A third identical object immediately appeared, traveled the same distance, stopped, and a fourth identical object repeated the process until it reached the 12 diameter distance.  The moment the fourth object stopped the entire string of four objects then pivoted on the central axis of their array with the last object appearing closest to my son with the original object the most distant.  The array swung in such a fashion that it became parallel to the ground, forming an east-west line.   At this point my son was able to see that there were still four objects even though they overlapped each other from his vantage point.  Within a second or two all the objects simply vanished, followed a few seconds later by two loud sonic booms.   At this point my son, then 16, made a hasty retreat to our home. He described the objects as having even illumination across the entire surface with distinct edges.  He described the green as similar to the green in a traffic signal.  The movement of the objects was very smooth as each emerged from the previous one.  His estimate was that the objects were about 1/4 mile from his location.  A set of electrical transmission towers runs on a southeast to northwest line, about 1/2 mile west of this location.   When I questioned him about the possibility of some sort of ball lightning or electrical plasma, he dismissed this possibility stating that the objects were never in the vicinity of the transmission lines.  He stated that the objects somewhat reminded him of the warning balls attached to power lines in the vicinity of airports.   Since the objects retained their circular shape as they pivoted, he made the assumption that they were spheres. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We were looking at the clear dark sky when we saw a VERY BRIGHT LIGHT appear very high in the n.e. sky. It had a glow around the bright light and was moving N.E. to S.W.  After about 10 seconds it stopped and the light went from VERY BRIGHT to a small pinpoint of light, and changed course 45 degrees in 1 second!! It was now going from High N.E. to due East.  After about 5 more seconds the light flashed twice and was gone.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Lights over Scottsdale early Feburary of 2001.;2001-02-05 20:30:00;2-5min;Lights over Scottsdale early Feburary of 2001. While on a business trip my supervisor and I were driving around Scottsdale after dinner.  We were looking for an open drugstore and were in a strip mall parking lot when I happened to look up towards the sky.  I saw 5 or 6 pale grayish white lights in a row on an angle (imagine a backslash only dot it with lights) slowly moving across the sky from right to left.  I alerted my supervisor and he confirmed that he saw them also.  Both of us had been in the aviation industry for several years each and very familiar with different aircraft types and their lighting and did not recognize these lights to be anything we had seen before.  We watched them for a minute or two, we even rolled down the windows in the car and craned our necks to get a better view.  We noticed that the objects did not seem to make any sound.  We asked two local men walking in the parking lot if they know what they were and they responded that they did not.  We left shortly after speaking with them.  Unfortunately I am unfamiliar with the Scottsdale area and I am unsure as to the direction we were looking when we saw the lights I believe it was southeast, however, I may very well be wrong.

Bright Lights in the Southern Sky over Phoenix.;2001-08-22 21:50:00;5 minutes;Bright Lights in the Southern Sky over Phoenix. Just before 10:00 pm, I could see two large redish/orange lights about 45deg. in the sky. I am located in North Scottsdale and was looking south towards South Mountain.  From my vantage point, I could not tell exactly how far they were from my location, but I would guess closer to South Pheonix.  The two lights did not move at all. They stayed in a stationary position, until one seemed to disappear.  A few seconds later, the second one disapeared.  About a minute later, I could almost see one again, but it never was as bright as the first time. I have served in the military, and I know what flares look like...  I can also say that this isn't the first time that I have seen these lights in the same general direction.  What is going on here? Why isn't there more exposure to this?  Or have I missed something altogether?;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Bubble with stationary beam shining into it, lightning bolt coming out of the bottom.;2002-09-19 19:36:00;2 minutes;Bubble with stationary beam shining into it, lightning bolt coming out of the bottom. We were driving West in North Scottsdale, by Grayhawk golf club.  We noticed a large orange-pink bubble (about the size of a hot air balloon times 10) fairly high in the sky.  The bubble had a stationary light beam shining directly into it that was much brighter and larger than we have ever seen.  There was a streak very similar to lightning that came from the bottom of the bubble all the way to the ground.  It was also the orange-pink color.  After a few minutes, the light faded away, and the bubble slowly faded.  The lightning streak was visible for about another 10 minutes, but moved west quickly.  Both of us immediately felt that we were seeing something not of this world.  Many other cars pulled over to observe. **We both work in the high-tech industry, have masters degrees, and don't believe we would jump to rash conclusions. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  Please see article.  PD)) ((BEGIN ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE ABOUT LAUNCH)) Air Force Test Missile Out West Fri Sep 20, 1:25 AM ET VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) - An Air Force missile test Thursday provided a spectacular light show seen over California and much of the West, as far away as Utah and New Mexico. The colorful contrail was seen soon after the unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off at 7:36 p.m. from an underground silo at the Vandenberg military base north of Santa Barbara. The smoke went up in spirals as the sun was setting and turned into an orange, amber color. It was like a flower going into bloom pretty quickly, said Simon Cox, who saw it from a restaurant terrace in Santa Barbara. The missile traveled about 4,200 miles in about 30 minutes, striking a predetermined target at the Kwajalein Missile Range in the western chain of the Marshall Islands, the Air Force said. Vandenberg spokeswoman Kelly Gabel said clear conditions were responsible for the spectacular light show. We do this two or three times a year, but because the weather was so perfect we decided to launch it early, Gabel said. As a result, people were still awake to see it, and although the sun had set, sunlight below the horizon glinted off unspent fuel particles and water droplets. Suddenly we're getting calls from people as far away as New Mexico who saw it and want to know what it is, Gabel said. The mission was directed by the 576th Flight Test Squadron at Vandenberg and the 341th Space Wing and the 341st Space Wing, from Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The purpose was to test launch systems and the missile's accuracy and reliability. ((END ARTICLE BY ASSOCIATED PRESS));33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Erractic pinpoint of light observed in  the night skies of greater Phoenix.;2004-01-13 22:00:00;3-5 seconds;Erractic pinpoint of light observed in  the night skies of greater Phoenix. At approximately 10:00 PM, I was relaxing in the outdoor spa of my apartment complex when I noticed a star-sized point of light in the eastern sky.  The point of light moved erratically to the right, then downward and to the left and then roughly northeast and out of my field of vision behind the apartment building, all the time very wobbly and erratic.  There is a lot of air traffic in the area and, being a private pilot myself, I am familiar with most aircraft lighting configurations.  What's more, there was an airliner visible several miles behind the luminous object heading nearly due west while the object moved in the foreground.  I had no way of estimating its size or range.  I can't say for sure what the luminous object was, but I can say with some confidence what the object was not.  It wasn't a meteor because it stopped and reversed direction.  It was not a model airplane because it moved too rapidly, and it was not a balloon because it was a windless evening and again, it moved too quickly.  It was almost certainly not a firework or flare --- it moved silently.  This is the first unusual sighting I've observed in the night sky.  I was not dreaming or intoxicated.  In fact, the event happened so quickly that I didn't have a chance to be surprised.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

This second time, the UFO was a little North of where it appeared the first time tonight.  As before, the UFO stopped in mid-air for some time and moved around slightly before performing an impossible 180 degree turn and quickly returning East from where it came. I was able to call nearby family this time, whereas last time they didn't pick up the phone in time. They were able to see the UFO before it left this time, so I increased the number of witnesses to three. If you can gain access to any weather, visibility, &quotsunrise&quot, or traffic cameras that point toward the Superstition Mountains and look out across the reservation - you will find footage. It glowed brighter than any stars, and brighter than any aircraft. Specific times were 11:05pm and 11:25pm. Additionally, the last plane to leave Sky Harbor International Airport in this direction was at 11:05pm.  The pilot, seemingly upon seeing the craft, executed a tight turn South. I did not see another plane or helicopter in the air until about 11:45pm.

They were quite a distance away, yet they were as large as the light on a helicopter that flew over my head at around the same time (the helicopter had nothing to do with the sighting, its just a size comparison).  The lights were a minimum of 10 miles away, so they were large and bright enough to clearly see.  They were mostly stationary and they formed a non-equilateral triangle.   The right-most light then started to head to the right (west) and it went out after about 10 seconds.  The middle light did the same thing about 30 seconds later.

That was definitely not an airplane, or helicopter or anything I can identify.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Star-like object in SE sky over Reservation with distinct multi-colored lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the star, Sirius.  PD));2015-12-31 22:00:00;60 minutes;Star-like object in southeast sky over Reservation with distinct multi-colored lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the star, Sirius.  PD))   Both yesterday (12/31/15) and tonight (1/1/16) we have seen a star-like object in the southeast sky as we went on a walk.  It caught my attention because it looks larger that a normal star and was twinkling different colors - blue, green, white, and red.  It behaved like the star as it moved higher in the sky as the night went on. I lost interest as I thought it must have been just a star.   Tonight I went for a walk with my parents and saw it again.  I pointed it out and they thought it was very strange. My whole family lived hear O'Hare in Chicago for a majority of our lives making us used to aircraft. We got out the binoculars and four of us (me, my parents, my boyfriend) viewed it through the binoculars all seeing the same thing - distinct red, blue, green, white lights - my dad said it reminded him of LEDs because they were so vivid and distinct. I could also see the halo around the object changing color with the object. My parents said they've never seen an! ything like it. It was higher than the planes that had taken off from the PHX airport (south, southwest of where we are, which flew below within the same view).  This is near 101 off Indian Bend Road. I am visiting my parents from Chicago. They said it is over the Native Amer Reservation east of Scottdale. I would like to know if this could be disproven, but everything man-made that flies doesn't really fit. Also, it doesn't fit as a star considering the distinct lighting. I also have video, but it's so grainy and it only looks like a star. Please let me know if anyone has an idea or if you would like video.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Bright white lights and lots of helicopters.;2016-01-18 22:40:00;unknown;Bright white lights and lots of helicopters Two very white bright lights were hovering over the city and/or native reservation.

5 lights seen traveling over Scottsdale/North Mesa area in uniform fashion.;2016-03-02 19:35:00;25 minutes;5 lights seen traveling over Scottsdale/ North Mesa area in uniform fashion. I was driving south on 101 Scottsdale toward Chandler.  Just before the Raintree exit, 5 light all in a row, travel from west of Scottsdale towards the east over the freeway (toward Fountain Hills).  They are evenly spaced without blinking lights, just white/pale yellow in color.   The lights move in a unified direction headed south very slowly, over Talking Stick resort area.  At moments they are still as if they are hovering in the sky.  I could see a helicopter around the lights and could tell the difference.  The helicopter had blinking red and blue lights were as the other lights did not.   The lights move south toward North Mesa, where I called a friend and he was at Gilbert Road and University.  He stated he could see lights hovering above him, but since he was looking up, he only saw 3 not 5.  He also stated that there wasn't any blinking lights like a helicopter.

Bright light in sky, slowly increase elevation and then faded. Second night in a row.;2018-04-13 20:30:00;3 minutes;Bright light in sky, slowly increase elevation and then faded. Second night in a row. I am a semi-retired finance professional with an advanced degree.  I rarely drink and do not do any drugs.  I am also an amateur astronomer with a small scope, and because the airport is fairly close, a plane watcher with binocs on the outside table at all times.  The point is that I am intelligent, sober, rational, skeptical, and I can recognize planes, man-made satellites (have seen 3), and stars/planets.  What I saw was not one of these. On 4/12, at 10:30 PM, took dogs outside for the normal business.  As usual I looked at the stars.  Visibility was good – a bit hazy at about 20 degrees and below from a dust storm earlier in the day but generally clear directly overhead with major constellations visible.   Saw a bright flash (about as bright as landing lights turning on but much farther away and not in the flight pattern) due west at about a 70 degree elevation.  The light was flashing at 15 second intervals (I measured it) which is too infrequent even for a plane at cruising altitude.  It was moving south for about 3 minutes but moving too slow for an aircraft and much much too slow for a satellite.  It also did not seem to be moving in a straight line (somewhat difficult to tell due to infrequency of flashes).  Over this time the light gradually dimmed and took-on a slight reddish hue before it became too dim to see. On 4/13 at 8:30 PM went outside for some fresh air.  Looked up and saw the identical scene with these changes:  I did not see initial flash and the direction was south/southeast.  The sky was much clearer tonight. Also, about 8 weeks ago I was up very early 3:00AM to catch a flight.  Outside with the dogs.  Looked up and saw a moving, steady light (no flashing or colored lights) about the size and magnitude of a typical star.  It was moving slower than satellites I have seen before, and seemed much too high for an aircraft (my first thought was that it was a private jet a high altitude).  The light moved straight south covering about a 20 degree arc and then quickly faded at about Orion’s shoulders. The third sighting in the list very well could have been a satellite, but the other two were definitely neither planes, satellites, nor meteorites.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Both lights blinked and moved around each other in a circular pattern.   They remained in that general direction for 1.5 hours.  They appeared to have bursts of light a couple times. They were pointed out to us by a neighbor.  We had company at our house and we all went outside to witness.  We took photos and a video.

There was a light moving intermittently in the sky with a hazy aura surrounding it.;2018-11-23 22:00:00;5 minutes;There was a light moving intermittently in the sky with a hazy aura surrounding it. We went outside on the patio and noticed a light in the sky, making erratic movements intermittently.  There was some kind of hazy aura around the object.  It appeared to be low in the sky and then disappeared.   We live very close to Scottsdale Airpark and see planes in the flight path daily.  There were other planes flying to and from the airpark when we noticed this object, which was very different from the planes flying last night and during other times we have seen them.   It was very obviously not an airplane but we have no other idea what it could have been. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with both witnesses to the event, husband and wife, and we found them both to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.  We suspect that they are highly reliable witnesses.

3 lights above McDowell mountains, changing colors rapidly.;2019-11-24 19:35:00;7 minutes;3 lights above McDowell mountains, changing colors rapidly. Have a really unique view of the McDowell mountains, on Mummy Mountain, up on the mountain, around 1600 ft of elevation. Was looking towards the McDowells, which would be directly Northeast of my view. Looked up and immediately was entranced by 3 very bright and large lights in the sky. Airplanes flying near so I could distinguish between a airplane as plane lights blink but these were not blinking.  My glasses weren’t on so they looked blurry, but they also were colorful and rapidly changing light colors.  I grabbed some binoculars and looked through, the light would change rapidly from yellow, green, red, blue, etc.  The lights were stationary for a couple minutes, maybe 2-3 minutes.  Soon they all started moving slowly to the south together, with the lights forming in a triangular formation.  They would move and rotate with one another, as if the 3 lights were a point of an invisible triangle rotating in the sky. They all faded out and disappeared after 5 minutes or so.  Had my wife look at the lights and she immediately noticed their colors changing as well.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

There was an initial group that is shown in the video. Several straggling lights were observed after the initial group moving erratically. All lights were at an elevation above the clouds. They can be observed moving behind the clouds. They were visible moving from the western horizon to the eastern horizon.  It appeared that there were conventional aircraft following the objects.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

I stayed and watched all of it until only one was left and it looked like it spilled some dark faded like smoke before ascending back up and disappearing.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

From roughly the 64th Street and Bell Rd intersection, briefly saw a crisp light in the SW sky, moving WSW at incredible speed.  Looked to be very high altitude and clear light - completely unlike a plane.  Moved at almost shooting star speed, but without the tail you get with a shooting star, hence excluding possibility of either a shooting star or a normal aircraft.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
