It was about four thirty pm and i was on vacation laying on a wicker couch outdoors. i was facing north west and i saw a sphere shaped object appear. It was in my direct line of sight and flew toward the southeast. it only took about five to seven seconds to pass. it was large compared to other objects that had been in the area. It looked to be the size of a eraser head and dark blue, almost a grey color much darker than the light sky. what was interesting to me was that it was so large , but so high in the sky and it flew past much faster than the planes i had been observering earlier. I was alone and called to my friend inside the house, by the time they came outdoors it had already moved from my view and out of sight. I thought it was strange and questioned my friend , since he is from the area.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

This was witnessed at 105th Street and McDowell Mountain Ranch Road toward the southwest sky.  There was other planes in the sky but none were around the object.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
Daylight sighting of a large spherical object on 9/17/04 hovering for more than three hours over northeast Scottsdale, AZ. ((Balloon));2004-09-17 07:30:00;2 HRS;Daylight sighting of a large spherical object on 9/17/04 hovering for more than three hours over northeast Scottsdale, AZ. I am writing to confirm a sighting similar to the one reported by an observer as occurring in Phoenix, AZ on 9/17/04.  A spherical object was sighted hovering in the cloudless sky over northeast Scottsdale, AZ on 9/17/04 at 7:30 AM. In addition to myself, the event was witnessed by my wife and four masonry contractors who were installing our patio. As the prior witness reported, the object was a large translucent silver sphere with six legs positioned around its perimeter. A line extended from its center with a ball shaped object attached at the end. There appeared to be a pulsating pale yellow light within the interior portion of the object. The contractors humorously likened the object's configuration to that of a huge jelly fish.  The object remained static and fixed in its position for more than three hours. The contractors reported that it eventually ascended and moved westward out of sight at approximately 11:00 AM. A friend later called to report that he initially observed the same object at daybreak hovering over his nearby home in Scottsdale. He also advised that the sighting was first reported by the local news media as an experimental balloon launched by Arizona State University. A second report stated that the object was a NASA experimental craft and that it had crash landed somewhere outside the local area. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the object might have been a large, helium-filled balloon, as indicated by the witness.  They are launched out of Arizona or New Mexico.

Brilliant undulating light hung motionless in the horizon, eventually dimmed, came back, and then disappeared;2012-04-24 22:10:00;20 minutes;Brilliant undulating light hung motionless in the horizon, eventually dimmed, came back, and then disappeared I stepped outside on my front porch and noticed a brilliant white sphere shaped light near the Northwest Horizon, just to the right and above the setting moon.  It appeared to undulate slightly but was not blinking. It was brighter than any planet I had ever seen.  I heard no noise.  Thinking it was an airplane, I watched for it to move, but over a 10 minute period it remained largely stationary.  I went to get my wife to show her. When I came back out with my wife, it had dimmed slightly but was still very bright.  We watched it for another 5 minutes.  I then went to get my binoculars to get a better look.  Just as I went into the house, my wife yelled for me to return because it had dimmed.  I came back to see the light fade out and go completely dark for a few seconds.  Then it returned briefly for a few seconds and then disappeared completely.  After it disappeared, we noticed a much dimmer light in the general vicinity that also faded to nothing after a few seconds.  About 10 minutes afterwards, a helicopter flew over the house very fast and low, but it was headed from east to west rather than northwest.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
