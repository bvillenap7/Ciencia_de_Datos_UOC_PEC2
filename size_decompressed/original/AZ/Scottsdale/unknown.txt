a red light in the night sky with a slow blinking white light;2019-10-18 10:40:00;20-30 seconds;a red light in the night sky with a slow blinking white light tonight i was walking around my apartment complex for while considering how nice out it is. on the way to the mailbox area, I saw a red light in the sky, and it had a slowly blinking white light. it was flying either downwards or farther away, I couldnt tell. it couldnt have been a plane since there was no noise of it flying. i tried to capture it with video footage on my windows phone, but i dont think anything showed up. this was about 20 to 30 minutes ago.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
