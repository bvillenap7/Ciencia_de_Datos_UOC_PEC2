Three bright orange low object under the monsoon clouds witnessed by two people.;2013-08-15 20:20:00;15 minutes;Three bright orange low object under the monsoon clouds witnessed by two people My friend and I observed 2 bright orange objects flying towards us very low in the sky as it was monsoon season and we had been having rain.  The two orange objects flew silently at a diagonal toward us under the clouds, so they were pretty low, like low flying aircraft would be.  No sound.   I got my binoculars and we both saw the same things:  Cylinder shape objects with bright orange fire burning inside, then another bright orange light of same color up to the right in the cylinder, but round shape. The 2 objects flew to a point over us.  They hesitated for a few moments, than one flew straight behind us out of sight while the second one flew away at approximately a 45 degree angle to our right.  Again, they were completely silent. We both looked at each other in amazement wondering aloud and comparing our sighting with each other.   While comparing out sighting I looked up at the direction the two objects had come from and there was a third identical object.  This one was much lower and couldnâ€™t have been more than 500 feet over us.  It flew directly towards us and then hovered directly overhead.  A few moments later it also flew off silently at a 45 angle to our right.  We were both to slow in thinking to record this event.
