It was a clear blue sky with no cloud cover.  I observed a shiny liquid mercury like teardrop shaped object in the sky, leaving a small jet stream lasting about 60 seconds. The silver object traveled at a high speed in a southerly direction over the city of Scottsdale. At arms length, it appeared to be the size of a tennis ball. At arms length the jet stream appeared about 6 inches long, straight and thin. There was no sound as it passed in the sky. It looked like a blob of the Terminator II from the movie.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
A small, low gliding disc shaped with a tail ufo was seen over Scottsdale.;2010-08-13 23:54:00;30 seconds;A small, low gliding disc shaped with a tail ufo was seen over Scottsdale. Driving on 56th street towards Shea, saw in the sky a very slow moving and seemingly low to the ground object, which look like a metallic disc with a tail.  Not very big, maybe as big as a swimming pool.  Had 3 lights, I think, which were fading in and out.  I had seen a massive shooting star fall towards the ground barely 2 minutes before.  The lights were whitish-blue and not like bright and starry shaped like lights in the sky can be but softer and blurrier.  It was moving too slowly to be anything else, and it was so close to the ground, I think the depth perception was hard. Nothing on the ufo was moving, it was just simply gliding across the air.  Then I turned left onto shea blvd and it was gone.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032

Then at least 20 minutes went by then, they were two headlight looking objects flying at least 50 ft off the ground.   Once we were clearly in sight of the object, the lights went out.  There were a lot of stars out so once the headlights went out we could see the outline of it.   The shape of it was a triangle you with curves.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
6 Silver Irregular Flying Objects Zig-Zagging Over Scottsdale, AZ;2019-09-25 04:07:00;10 minutes;6 Silver Irregular Flying Objects Zig-Zagging Over Scottsdale, AZ There were 6 silver objects flying off in the distance in zig zags and other particular patterns that no regular aircraft could do. I was able to get pictures of these 6 flying objects and it shows the shape of them and edge of the craft.  The moon was able to beam off of the flying objects which is why they where easy to spot.  The flying objects looked to be in a specific tear drop or almost circular pattern.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
