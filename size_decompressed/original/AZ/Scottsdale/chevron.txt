Orange glowing light over Scottsdale, AZ.;2014-01-04 23:00:00;2 minutes;Orange glowing light over Scottsdale, AZ. From my backyard, I noticed what looked like an orange ball of fire moving east to west.  As it got closer, the object appeared to be a flaming chevron or bow shape that was glowing and smoldering like a fire.  The object appeared to completely stop when it was directly south of my backyard, then change direction, moving north toward my home, then stopped again, turning 180 degrees in a half circle motion back to the southern horizon until my view was obstructed by a home.  The object did not make any engine or propeller noise while I observed it and also seemed to change direction in a controlled and deliberate manner.  Visibility was clear and moon, stars and constellations could be clearly seen.;33.5912122222221;-111.894591746032
