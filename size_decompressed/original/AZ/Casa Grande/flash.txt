Neon-like light appeared then disappeared, no afterglow, no blast explosion ejecta pattern, no craft.;2018-11-26 20:40:00;2-3 minutes;Neon-like light appeared then disappeared, no afterglow, no blast explosion ejecta pattern, no craft. Monday Nov. 26, 2018 at approx 8:40 p.m. On SR87 heading South to eventual destination of Tucson. Before N. signal Peak Rd. Right after White Mountain pass Rd. I saw an orange-red light that had no afterglow. The color was almost  neon in nature. Shape light went straight up into an upside down U then extended down. The light appeared, then went black, then came back on, then off.  The truck in front of us slowed then stopped in the road for a few seconds, then drove off. A car driving the opposite way stopped by the side of the road and 2 passengers got out of their car and looked up. My husband, our driver, cursed at the driver in front of us who had stopped and then we took off. My husband made no mention of the light and I did not mention it too him. My husband is retired law enforcement, he would not talk about such things.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
