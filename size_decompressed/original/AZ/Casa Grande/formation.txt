Phoenix lights witnessed in Casa Grande, AZ;1997-03-13 22:00:00;8 seconds;Phoenix lights witnessed in Casa Grande, AZ On this night I was riding in the backseat of my friends car, he was driving and his wife was in the passenger seat. We were heading out of town to his house travelling west on HWY 87. My friend suddenly pointed out of the front window and shouted, look or something to that effect. I leaned forward in my seat and all 3 of us witnessed lights in the sky. It was a row of lights about five across. They appeared to be very close, the windows were down and we heard no sound. I did not have much time to consider what they were before this happened: each light, one at a time in order went out, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and in the same timing/rythm all five came on together, stayed for a beat longer and then all five blanked out at the same time. We saw no more, heard nothing, the lights did not fly away or appear to have moved about. They just went out. In Casa Grande, on this road in particular, there is nothing to obstruct the view of the sky. No streetlights, no tall trees, and no hills or mountains. It is flat. I refueled helicopters at Fort Hood, Texas and it did not appear to be anything that I have seen before. Furthermore there would have to be five helicopters together generating lots of noise and hovering very, very close togther or a LARGE helo with five landing lights. This did happen at the same time that the Phoenix lights appeared. I am certain that this was a part of that occurence.
