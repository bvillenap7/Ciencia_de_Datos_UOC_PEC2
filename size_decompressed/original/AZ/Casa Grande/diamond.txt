Odd stationary orange glowing objects over the Sonoran desert;2017-06-27 23:45:00;30 minutes;Odd stationary orange glowing objects over the Sonoran desert I looked out my window toward the west and thought I was seeing small brush fires on the desert hills.  I got my binoculars and realized these were orange glowing objects above the horizon.  They did not move!  But they did extinguish over time, but then re-appear!   Typically there were two in a horizontal formation, maybe an inch apart from my vantage point.  They seemed to be in the far distance, like over Maricopa, Arizona, 20 miles west of my location.  The event lasted at least 30 minutes.  The most notable thing was these objects never appeared to move.  They were rock solid in their location in the low western shy, for as long as they were visible (5 to 10 minutes?).   As a former Radar tech in the USAF I tried to imagine some sort of tech this could be, but nothing comes to mind.  I had plenty of time to get my camera.   Set it on manual and was able to get photos..;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
