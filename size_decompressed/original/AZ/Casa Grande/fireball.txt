I was driving from Tucson to Chandler for work this morning, when all of a sudden, this light lit up the sky.  ((anonymous report));2018-12-04 04:45:00;1.83 seconds;I was driving from Tucson to Chandler for work this morning, when all of a sudden, this light lit up the sky.  At first I thought it was an asteroid and I thought this was the end.  It appeared as though the object was at a standstill very briefly, and then, it was as if it turned on its thrusters, a big thrust of blue/white fire or something emitted from behind it and it was gone in a flash. This is the second time I've seen something of this nature on this stretch of road, but this time it was unmistakable.
