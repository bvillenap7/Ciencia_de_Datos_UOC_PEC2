Distortion crosses starlit skies.;2007-03-15 02:00:00;45 seconds;Distortion crosses starlit skies. We've just moved to Arizona and purchased a home.  I was by our pool enjoying the starlit desert skies when an object caught the corner of my eye.  The object was like none I've seen before.  The object appeared to be at an airliner's cruising height, however, there were no visible lights on the object.  The object was crossing the sky at a speed which appeared to be twice that of a normal airliner. The object appeared to be triangular in shape against the bright starlit sky, however, the object appeared to be distorted.  The only comparison I can provide is the distortion appeared like a ship coming out of cloak and remained constant. The night was quiet and there were no other airlines visible within my view.  There was no sound made by this craft, total silence. I watched the distortion cross the skies rapidly, within a blink of the eye the distortion disappeared.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
Two orange lights spotted in desert, gone quickly, not plane.;2014-04-14 08:30:00;0.3;Two orange lights spotted in desert, gone quickly, not plane. I was in the car with my grandparents out on the dirt roads in the desert parts of Casa Grande when I saw two circular orange lights close together but a half a mile from me (or less).  I wasn't sure what they were so I didn't say anything because I've pointed out lights before suggesting they were UFO's and always ended up sounding stupid.  Anyways, the lights were there one second and gone the next, in the blink of an eye,without a trace. I know they weren't planes because the lights didn't blink and planes couldn't fly away so quickly on a seemingly cloudless night.

Vertical string of lights in Arizona.;2015-09-30 02:20:00;90 minutes;Vertical string of lights in Arizona. At 220 AM Arizona Time 30 September 2015 I was outside taking the trash to the curb. I looked up at the moon, which was directly overhead and as I turned I saw a group of blinking lights in the South-East. The lights were stationary and blinking red, green, and white.  I took out my cell phone to check the compass direction and discovered that it was useless.  I was looking at what I know to be Southeast and my compass inexplicably read West.  I did, however, have a pair of opera glasses within easy reach so I went in to find them. Using the opera glasses I was able to make out a vertical string of blinking lights, in red green, and white.  The string of lights hung in the sky like a string of multicolored pearls for over an hour.  During all that time all I could do was watch.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
