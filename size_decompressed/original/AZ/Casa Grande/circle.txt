I was watching a program on Planet Earth talking about these lights today(02/21/11.  In 1997 we were sitting on our front porch facing Phx,Az. The lights appeared,came toward usthen softly flew over us...I say softly cause there was no sound,none, soft. It was just balls of WHITE LIGHTS nothing else nothing. I know sometimes eyes can play trick, but this time I'm going with the eyes.   We saw a ufo on March 13,1997.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182

Large, silver, circular craft with square lights all the way around, hovering and spinning near Casa Grande Mountain.;2010-11-01 21:18:00;less than a minute;Large, silver, circular craft with square lights all the way around, hovering and spinning near Casa Grande Mountain. At exactly 9:18pm on November 4th, 2010 I was driving home from Albertson's in Casa Grande, AZ to Arizona City. I took Trekell Road to Interstate 8 towards Tucson. While I was on Interstate 8, just coming around Casa Grande Mountain I noticed this huge circular aircraft to my left. The aircraft seemed to be relatively close. I'm not a very good judge of distance but I can tell you it wasn't much higher in the air than the top of the mountain that was to my right. What caught my attention initially, were these square shaped whitish yellow lights in a row to my left... I rolled my window down and without window tint in the way I could see the silver circular craft sort of hovering to my left. The lights were sort of arranged the way you would see princess cut diamonds arranged on an anniversary band but not stuck together, spaces inbetween and the lights brightness allowed me to see the silver color on the craft only around the lights. I don't know if the underside or the top was the same honestly. It started to rotate clockwise, sort of slowly as if it were on an axis just beginning to spin. As it started to rotate it appeared to pixelate and just disappear entirely. When I say pixelate, it literally looked like your T.V. screen would look when your cable has a glitch and the picture moves in little squares. This is what this craft did, it appeared to disappear one little square at a time in a matter of maybe 1-2 seconds. I immediately looked at my clock radio in my car and that is how I know this happened at 9:18pm. I called my husband immediately to tell him about it, as this is not the first UFO we have seen in our area... However the other one we saw were triangular with 3 orange lights. This was something entirely different. If I had to guess on a size, I would say it was about the size of a small grocery store. There was no sound or vibration of any kind... It was very odd. It definitely gives a little more merit to the interdimensional theories of UFO's in my opinion.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
4 lights over Casa Grande, AZ.;2017-03-11 20:55:00;3 minutes;4 lights over Casa Grande, AZ. My son's and I saw 4 bright orange orb lights in the night sky of Casa Grande, AZ, about 8:55pm on 03/11/2017.  We watched them until they disappeared one by one.   A jet passed the lights and in know way could they miss the sighting.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
