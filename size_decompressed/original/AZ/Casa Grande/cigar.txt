Saw a UFO at 10,000 feet 2 Miles south of I-8 & I-10 near Casa Grande, Arizona.;2004-10-27 06:30:00;3 Minutes;Saw a UFO at 10,000 feet 2 Miles south of I-8 & I-10 near Casa Grande, Arizona. Sighting.  2 Miles south of the juction of Interstate 8 and Interstate 10 in Arizona.  Approximate altitude of 10,000 feet.  UFO had a band of colored lights surrounding the craft.  It appeared stationary in the sky for 3 minutes and then dissapeared.  No sound.  This craft looked exactly like the video taken by the man and his daughter behind their restaraunt.  I am sorry I can not be more specific but I am sure some of you know of the video I am speaking about.  It is sightings like this that make you wish you were right there to inspect the craft instead of being at a great distance.  If anyone can confirm this sighting, I would greatly appreciate it.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
