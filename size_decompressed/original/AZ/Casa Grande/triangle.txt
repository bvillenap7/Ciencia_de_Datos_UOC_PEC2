((HOAX??))  not just pheonix lights;1997-06-30 21:00:00;3 nights;not just pheonix lights this is regarding to the pheonix lights over arizona. the military is saying that they were flares. well they were not only seen over pheonix arizona. we were on our way home from casa grande to colonial del sol which is a couple miles outside of casa grande arizona going north and in a vacant field in between casa grande and colonial del sol up in the sky there was first one light,then another,then another. it went up to 5 or 6 of the lights. they were a bright yellow orange. we were trying to figure out what they were. the only thing that we could come up with at first was helicopters, because the lights just stayed in one spot and they were so bright. then they started to go out down 2 then 3, then they would come back on. then they would all go out. we then later watched the same lights west of colonial del sol for several nights after. we would watch these lights appear then go down to one light which would turn red and shoot all over the place. there are no military flares that will do that! then during the day i also saw some things that i thought was kind of funny. i saw bright matalic objects up in the air that would stay in one spot for a couple minutes and then just be gone. i also saw a bright matalic object over by the top of casa grande mountain during the day. my brother did call sights and they had planes flying over the area the next few nights.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
Triangle Shaped Object Over I-10 Near Casa Grande.;1998-08-07 00:00:00;5 minutes;Triangle Shaped Object Over I-10 Near Casa Grande. The incident  occurred in Arizona on August 7, 1998 on I-10 between Phoenix and Casa Grande around 12 midnight. The area is the Gila Bend Reservation and there is not a lot of development - no lights.  It was a very clear night as was usual in Arizona.  As I was traveling south, I notice ahead that several cars on the interstate appeared to be putting their brake lights on, slowing and it also seemed that several had stopped completely.  I assumed I was approaching a wreck. As I got closer to an overpass, I saw that cars were also pulled off the road and at least one man was out of the car looking up.  Suddenly on the right side of the car, an object raced by me (at or near car level).  It was like a bright flash that zoomed past me like I was sitting still. The hair stood up on my arms and I realized that this was something out of the ordinary. At that point I told my son, who was asleep in the back seat to wake up.  The object had the brightest lights I had ever seen and at that time I couldn't tell anything about the shape.  Once I got on the other side of the overpass, the object was overhead.  It was triangle shaped with three super bright white lights on the three corners. At this point, I could see the object race back and forth overhead crossing the interstate from right to left and back. sort of in a swooping flight path.  At the same time, it was turning and rotating and the lights were shining down on the road, in the air, and all over.  (The motion would be as if you were holding an object in your hand and turning your hand round and round.)  There was absolutely no sound.  This whole incident took 5 minutes.  I didn't actually stop the car but continued driving at a very slow pace.  I know that others were pulled off and looking as I drove away.  Being alone with my son, I was worried stopping. I have seen a few odd things from time to time looking out at the sky.  However this incident was beyond that.  It was close and it was real.

Triangle object that moved with incredible speed;1999-08-13 11:00:00;3 minutes;Triangle object that moved with incredible speed It was a Triangle shaped object while traveling up the I-10.  Maybe 25 miles north of Casa Grande.  At first it was hovering above the ground near the mountain.  This large triangle craft, with 1 light on each end, then flew over towards us on the I-10.  It moved at an incredible rate of speed, and stopped on a dime.  It hovered not far from us, and didn't make any loud noise, just a hum.  It then flew back to where it was originally, and disappeared.  Strangely, no one else driving by stopped to get out(that we could see)   Some strange irony to it, the band we saw that night at the casino was 'Starship' ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

triangle with very bright lights on I-10 near Casa Grande;1999-08-13 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;triangle with very bright lights on I-10 near Casa Grande I have looked occasionally on this site to see if anyone else had posted about a sighting in near Casa Grande AZ in 1999.  To my surprise, someone else posted and apparently saw the exact thing I saw.  Large, triange-shaped craft with three very bright lights on each corner.  The craft was darting very quickly across I-10 as we approached from the north.  My son was asleep in the back seat and I woke him to look.  The craft at one point got along side of the car and then shot at a very high speed parallel to the interstate..as if it was racing the cars.  At least two times, the craft seemed to stop in mid air and then spin, moving in the opposite direction.  I heard nothing.  I slowed to watch but was too stunned to stop.  I saw only one car pulled to the side.  All others were going very slowing on the interstate.  I know what I saw and it was real.  I wish the other poster would contact me by email.

I observed a boomerang shaped object above my vehicle on the I-10 freeway, suspended without motion and completely silent.;2000-08-23 22:42:00;8 minutes;I observed a boomerang shaped object above my vehicle on the I-10 freeway, suspended without motion and completely silent. I was driving down Interstate 10 (east bound) when I noticed a bright, low, lingering, diamond shape object straight ahead.  At that point I was at mile post 182. I continued to drive until I was directly beneath the object at mile post 184.5.  At that time I noticed the object was not a diamond, but rather a series of dotted white lights that formed a boomerang shape with a bright soft light at the vertex.  The object appeared to be silent and still. I stepped out of my vehicle and whatched the object approximately 8 min.  I feel others had witnessed the lights because vehicles were weaving in their lanes as they drove under the object.  I drive this route quite frequently and am aware of the crop dusters and other aircraft in the area and am positive this was not of the ordinary.  I also am very familiar with the different types of aircraft, because I am a former flight attendant.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
on the 3rd of july at around 10pm I was in the desert about 3 miles south of exit 200 on i 10 &i8 outside of Casagrande AZ.I was lookin;2005-07-03 22:00:00;40min;on the 3rd of july at around 10pm I was in the desert about 3 miles south of exit 200 on i 10 &i8 outside of Casagrande AZ.I was looking at stars with my binoculars when i noticed to the west of me above C.G MOUNTAIN a bright yellowish light simaliar to a sodium vapor color i was approxamatly 2 miles to the east of the mountain at the time of the sighting at first I thought it to be a helecopter but you couldnt hear any noise and there were no flashing red lights i thought it strange to be in on spot for so long it hovered in the same spot for about 10min. than another identicial light appeared to the left side of the first at the distance i was at about a 4fingers spacing so what ever it was if it was a fixed wing craft it would be extremely large I watched it for about another 5 min with the two lights on through my binoculars the lights had no distinct form bright and blurry but i could tell whatever it was it was one craft no separation.like a big wing then one of the lights on the object shut off and started moving to the south following the length of the mountain for about a half mile than stopped again and then the other light turned on and than the lights would alternatly flash on and off.but it just stayed there. i decided to drive over to where it was so i could get a better look,but by the time i got to the base of the mountain it was gone.and i didnt see it fly anywhere as i watched while driving towards it the lights were just gone. the next day a freind was telling me that he saw a large triangular shaped object fly above him that night and thought it odd for how large it was it didnt make any noise and asked me what kind of plane it might be he thought i might know since i was in the airforce. two nights later i was driving my jeep through the desert going to look at stars again very close to the same location i was at the time of the first sighting two nights prior. and ahead of me and very low to the ground i seen the same brite yellowish lights directly in front of me.then all the sudden the lights shut off but when they did one very bright light flashed on the ground about 100yds in front of me illuminating a circular area quit large and bright enough to see the desert floor like a big bright spot light and then went out. then i looked straight up and this craft was above me were i could get a look at it even though it was night except for allot of stars it darkened a good portion of the sky like a big solid black wing bloting out the stars it was shaped like a large boomarang my guess at the time was less than a 100ft above me and as it passed above me it made a silent whoshing noise.and could feel it energy like a wind blast as went past me going in a southerly diection towards TUCSON.and as quick as it was above me it was gone just vanashed from sight. I make this statment true to the best of my knowledge and with sound mind and judgement. I feel it important to document these events and the more we do this the less likely the more evidence the less likly for the government to deny that these things really exist to many people have seen these things.and also I would like to thank N.U.F.O reporting center for the excellent job they are doing by establishing a data base.so that people can freely post a sighting of what they have seen without any negative critisisms from narrow minds these things are real maybe soon well know the truth of why there here if anyone else in the south central AZ area has seen something like this on the nights of the 3rd and 5th of july 2005 please get in touch i would like to find out more on whatever this object might be or how many others seen the same.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
Triangular craft with orange lights moving in an odd pattern.;2006-09-25 20:53:00;2-3 mins;Triangular craft with orange lights moving in an odd pattern Viewed non-traditional shaped craft from eastern horizon to western horizon.  Craft had three orange colored lights on hull and flew in an alternating pattern from left to right.  As it passed overhead it made an unusual engine sound, unlike jets, or other traditional aircraft.  Craft moved from horizon to horizon in a matter of 2-3 minutes. Originally thought I was viewing Mars, due to color.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
Triangular distortion hovers and vanishes with pulse.;2008-04-24 03:15:00;30 or so seconds;Triangular distortion hovers and vanishes with pulse. I let our dogs out and sat waiting by our pool.  The night is beautiful and the sky bright with stars.  To the west of our home I noted a distortion in the sky, silent in sound and the object appeared to be hovering.  The distortion was triangular in shape, and although hard to explain appeared to be pulsating.  I don't have the exact length of time I viewed the object, however, my estimate is slightly over 30 seconds.  The object began to pulse rapidly and was simply gone!  We've lived in several states over the years, but only in Arizona have I seen strange and unidentifiable objects in the skies.  Perhaps this is military work in progress, perhaps it was from another world.  I called for the dogs and we hurried inside.
