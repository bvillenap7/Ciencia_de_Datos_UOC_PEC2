Small light moving fast, suddenly changed shape to expose more lights, shape of craft, and a source of the lights.;2004-07-25 04:15:00;Approx 3 Minutes;Small light moving fast, suddenly changed shape to expose more lights, shape of craft, and a source of the lights. My friend and I were headed back to Phoenix from Tucson after a concert, on the I-10 headed west somewhere between Casa Grande and Phoenix.  At about 4:10 or 4:15 in the morning, I see to the left of the car (which would be the south side of the interstate) a small light travelling in the same direction as my car.  I would say it was about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away from us, and at first I thought it was an airplane or helicopter, but the way it moved was like nothing I had ever seen before.  It was able to change directions so quickly there was no possible way it could have been a helicopter or an airplane.  It was about this time that my friend Josh said WHOA, UFO! and pointed out in the direction of the light I was observing.  It seemed like it was on cue, but as soon as Josh spotted the same fast moving light that I was looking at, the object either appeared to change shape, or some lights were turned on that emitted about 8 or 10 beams that completely lit up the desert below the craft.  The source of the lights were clearly visible and they almost had an orange or purple tint to them.  There was a row of lights on the bottom part of the craft, shining down on to the desert floor and I could also see slighly dimmer lights around the edge of the craft, above the spot lights.  It continued to move the same direction as the car for about 10 or 15 seconds, then change directions, approx South and either landed or was moving extremely fast and went over the horizon.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
Bright object appeared in the sky and traveled from point A to Point B in what seemed to be instantaneous.;2015-10-24 15:12:00;1 minute;Bright object appeared in the sky and traveled from point A to Point B in what seemed to be instantaneous. Essentially it appeared out of nowhere near in the middle of the sky during the afternoon. It almost looked like a meteor intercepting the atmosphere. However, this object was traveling very fast.  It traveled 1/3rd the distance from the horizon to horizon almost instantly. When I say instantly, I mean instantly. Point A to Point B in what seemed to be faster than a lightning bolt making contact with the ground. It was very bright.  Almost pure white. My friend saw it too, however we were the only two to notice in the group.  We were at a music festival so there was a large crowd. I am unsure if anyone else saw it other than us.  We verified that it was not a camera flash because there were nobody with a camera in the direction we were looking.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
Light panned across roofs too slow to be a meteor.  No conventional aircraft lights or noise.  ((anonymous report));2019-01-03 02:45:00;5 minutes;Light panned across roofs too slow to be a meteor.  No conventional aircraft lights or noise. Automotive headlights not an option. My home is in the last 2 streets in the neighborhood on the edge of the desert.  Took dog outside at 2:45am.  Noticed a soft yellow light illuminating the rooftops to the west.  My neighbors illuminated roof had a odd pattern of a sharp half circle of darkness.  Witnessed the light travel south slowly off the roofs.  It was then I realized the light was from behind me at a 60-degree angle up in the sky.  Turned around, looking for light source and something large and black silently zipped off Into the darkness.  Entire episode happened in silence.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
