Both the receiver and I were outside,(trailers are put on a large scale platform, and titled into the air, to empty out the product into a conveyor/hopper), Both the man that worked for the receiver and I were looking up @ the nose of the trailer, up in the air, when I noticed a dim light, slowly brighten ,,to a very bright light(like a reostat, landing light brightness), I turned to the the reciever and said, did you see that?, and he replied, that's what I'm lookin' at. We both watched as this light SLOWLY,(reostat action again), dimmed to black/nothing.We looked @ each other,,and both commented on the oddness of what we both saw. @ this time it started to appear again,in the slow, reostat increase, IN THE SAME SPOT, and stayed the steady, landing light type brightness, and then gradually faded to black. We looked @ each other again, and Jim said that this was to strange. We both could clearly see the stars, and there was no running lights of any kind(and we are located just south of an airport, requiring the use of these). I travel the southwestern US in my job,,and have seen several questionable things in the night sky, most of which I have always attributed to meteors or comets, this series of light were neither, to the best of my judgement. There was no aircraft noise in the area, no running lights were seen, and no contrail/ tails were seen preceeding what we had witnessed. We both agreed what we had seen was out of the ordinary. After we waited/looked for awhile, jim said  musta been a lost UFO, turned on his cab light to see his mapbook, we both chuckled, and i mentioned that this was one for The Art Bell show(which I had just finished listening to you both on). Bright, white lights, fading in, and out of intensity,,of landing light intensity.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
amber lights over I-10 near Casa Grande Az.;2005-10-11 19:00:00;30 minutes;amber lights over I-10 near Casa Grande Az. My daughter and i saw a diagonal formation of three amber lights and one single amber light above. We were on I-10 heading from Tucson to Phoenix.  Just before Casa Grande we saw them to the west for about 10 minutes then disapeared.  They reappeared about 20 miles later passing by Sacaton, they again disapeared after seemingly moving towards the ground.  Then about 20 miles later as we crossed the Gila River before getting into Phoenix and they were there again this time the top light moved from right to left of the formation over next 10 minutes.  Then one by one starting with top one they faded out.  We did not see anything on the way back to Tucson.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
Phoenix Lights all over again.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly flares over Gila Bend Firing Range.  PD));2007-02-06 20:00:00;5 - 7 min;Phoenix Lights all over again Exactly like the Phoenix lights.  Facing Due west from Casa Grande.  5 white lights hovered for about 5-7 min.  One light kept breaking into two and then going back into one - did this 8-9 times - no consistancy with the light breaking into two and then one again. ((NUFORC Note:  Because of both the location, and nature, of the bright objects, we strongly suspect that the bright objects may have been aerial flares, launched from aircraft over the Barry M. Goldwater Firing Range, located near Gila Bend, AZ.  That is what official military sources apparently reported, shortly after the event had occurred, and we have no reason to doubt that claim.

Strange lights in the sky during the day;2008-03-09 15:00:00;10 minutes +;Strange lights in the sky during the day On March 9, 2008 at 3 pm in the afternoon, I saw a circular group of lights in the northern sky that remained permanent. South of the circle I saw 2 other lights, one stationary, the other passing back and forth across the stationary one. I watched them for approximately 10 minutes. I saw several planes in the vinicity but the lights appeared to be much higher than the planes. I notified security at the place I was at about what I had seen. One other person also observed the siting.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
Round Yellow Lights in the evening sky, south of Phoenix.;2014-04-29 21:45:00;1 hour;Round Yellow Lights in the P.M. sky, south of Phoenix. Tuesday April 29th, 2014. West of I-10 between Chandler Arizona and Casa Grande Arizona approx 9:45pm. Looking West towards Maricopa about 10 miles south of Chandler 2 yellow lights first appeared to be hovering over a lit up sports complex out in the desert.  Not sure it IS  a sports complex out there, but the lights on the ground are similar to one.   As we drove south on I-10 and got more directly east of that complex we saw the lights start to move further apart and head in a south direction.  At first there were 2 lights, but as they moved south 2  more appeared and trailed behind those.  They were somewhat larger lights than you would see on a plane moving across the sky. The height seemed to be about double or triple the height of the sports complex lighting. As they moved south the first 2 lights rose higher with the last 2 remaining closer to the ground. It appeared to be a line of 4 lights at varying heights.  One of the lower lights dimmed out along the way.  We drove along watching those till they were obscured by the hills approaching the rest area by Casa Grande.  The ride from where those sports complex lights are to the rest area is approx 20 – 25 min.  We observed them the whole way down.    A couple times the lights would dim somewhat and then disappear completely. There was always at least one visible.   2 lights reappeared as we passed the hills (don’t know if they went out or which ones they were) and we followed those 2 lights- which dimmed again, one went out, one came back on, for a period of another 10 min., or so, as we drove west, up to Kortsen Rd, 8 miles west into Casa Grande. We could  no longer tell if they were the same lights or 2 new ones as they would dim out, and then re-emerge further down the road.  All the time being the exact same yellow light and same size as previously observed. We then headed back north on Kortsen Rd. for about 2 or 3 miles to the big plant that’s out there.  We are now about 30-35 miles south of Chandler.   We sat and watched the 2 lights till they faded out, about 20 minutes.  At this point they no longer seemed to be moving, just sitting pretty high in the sky, well above where we had first seen them hovering over those sports complex lights, pretty low in the sky.  Before fading out we saw what appeared to be a smaller craft, which looked more like a plane with the regular small white and red lights circling these 2 yellow lights.  As it circled, it headed west, then south, and as it came around heading east again and appearing to be almost in line with these 2 yellow lights, the yellow lights went out.   The lights that seemed to be a small plane craft stayed out there moving slowly.   We left after a few minutes and kept looking back to see if they reappeared but they did not.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
Bright pair of white lights south of Phoenix area.;2016-02-16 22:30:00;5 minutes;Bright pair of white lights south of Phoenix area On Coast to Coast Am just now, Peter Davenport said reports of lights near Phoenix area were reported, and may be flares from nearby military test range.  I have seen very bright pairs of white lights 2 nights this past week, on 2/16 & 2/17.  I am a truck driver and regularly drive between Tucson & Phoenix on my graveyard shift.  This took me driving west on I-10 between 9:30pm & 10:30pm on both those nights.  On the 16th, I looked to my left around the McCartney Rd exit near Casa Grande, AZ, to see 2 very bright white lights.  As I have seen strange things in the night skies many times, I looked to see if there were any blinking lights to show they were aircraft, and I saw none.  I looked again maybe 20 seconds later and one of the lights was gone.  After this I payed close attention to the remaining bright light for 3 or 4 more minutes and saw it quickly fade away to dim then gone.  I assumed this was a flare from test range beyond the mountains in the direction I was looking.  The next evening, around the same time, I again saw 2 bright lights next to each other in the sky around the same area of I-10.  Curiosity had me pay greater attention to both then the previous night.  After maybe 5 or 6 minutes, I again saw one dim then quickly go out, but maybe 20 seconds later flared back bright again for maybe 10 seconds, the instantly out again, and within 2 to 3 seconds, the 2nd light disappeared almost instantly.  These again, I assumed were military flares, which is why I did not report them to you here.  I am only now doing so, as it was mentioned on C2C.  Your reports may have come from Phoenix, in which case they would be reported to south, instead of west, of Casa Grande.  Feel free to contact me if any questions or clarification is needed.;32.8943295454546;-111.742869318182
