We were sightseeing on Reddington Pass when two vicious dogs attacked the car.  We looked up towards the sky and saw a dark grey or black object hovering over the  Whetstone Mtns.  We started driving towards the object.  It was an oval shaped football object.  As we kept getting closer and closer to it, the object remained in the same place.  It did not move at all.  There were no lights.  We drove towards it for at least 45 minutes.  It got dark and we lost visual contact.;31.8964;-110.2183
