I captured this amazing Footage of an unknown object at 2:19 appearing and slowly rotating before leaving the area with ease during a rain storm with high winds last night at work. You be the judge on what it is! Cause I know that no aircraft can move like that in those conditions .

Bell 407 Helicopter 70-80 meters away next to Windsock pole.  Two lane road  300-400 meters away. Weather conditions: winds 10-15 mph with gust 15-20 mph. 100% cloud cover with lighting and thunder.

Last night while I was at work watching the surveillance system, I notice that seemed to be on a street light.  Like a card board box was stick on the very top of the light.  So I went outside to see if it was something stuck.  I didnâ€™t see anything on the light pole.  Since the weather outside was raining, covered skies and windy. 	I looked back at the footage and seen an object float in the air and rotate downward from a vertical position and then accelerate.  I downloaded the file for the event.
