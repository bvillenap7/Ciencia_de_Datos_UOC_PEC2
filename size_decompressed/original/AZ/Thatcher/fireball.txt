It hovered there a few minutes,  My friend came out and i said what the hell is that, about that time it took of to the east at a high rate of speed only taking about 10 seconds to reach the gilas.  A few minutes later a second one did the same thing then a third.  I left and went home.  I heard no sound.;32.8537;-109.7387
