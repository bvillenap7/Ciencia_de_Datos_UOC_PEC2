It remained motionless in the air for about 5 to 6 min.  Then it just kept coming down as if to meet the ground and at a slow pace then going up and then it kept coming down as if to land.   The light was a red vibrating light not the sort as an airplane would have and not going off and on.   I watched it until I couldn't see it anymore an it was well below the tree tops and it just seemed to keep on a steady course of coming down. The shape seem to appear round and a red light that was vibrating like from deeper red to pinkish and just kept doing that.   At first I thought it was an airplane but the more I watched it it wasn't moving like airplanes would move.  It would stop in a area then start up again and moving downward.   Once it started back up and then it just kept coming down as toward the ground.  When I first saw it,  it was due south then it was goin south/west.   It appeared to be slowly falling to the ground,   and there was no noise at all.   You would hear an airplane in the sky if it were,   and the light was very different.  It was almost like a strob light affect.   I watched it until I couldn't see it any longer then came into the house to contact you.   One other detail I have three Shih Tzu's and they were just standing next to me the whole time and just smelling the air as if there was something there.   And this is odd because I have a seven month old pup who never stands still when I take them out at night,  they stood the whole time with me some twenty minutes not moving.    I had to force them to come into the house when I could no longer see it.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
In the north/east sky I noticed a flashing object while I was out with my dogs and watched it and then it was gone.;1999-11-07 22:55:00;23:15pm;In the north/east sky I noticed a flashing object while I was out with my dogs and watched it and then it was gone. I was out with my three dogs and looking at the sky and noticed a flashing object and watched it for about fifteen to twenty minutes and it never moved and then it was just gone.    It had a rotating light which seemed to be mostly white and only a flash of red and it seemed to have a hazie appearance about it.   But mostly it was white and just sat in the sky in the north/east sky just rotating and hovering.    Then it was as if someone just turned off the lights and it wasn't there any longer. There was no sound that seemed to generate from the object just silence and stillness.   I couldn't even hear any crickets,   that's how quiet it was.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133

The light was flashing as if off and on and it moved so slow that it couldn't be an air plane.   And then I observed in the north an air plane and the speed was faster that the object in the sky.   It kept a steady even motion as it went across the sky and when it was in the west part of the sky it just vanished.  It was if someone turned off the light.   The thing that struck me was that it would move and at times seem to stop and stand still then move on.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
