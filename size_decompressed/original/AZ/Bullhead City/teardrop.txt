Three (3) unknown speeding craft(s).;2019-11-14 21:04:00;20 seconds;Three (3) unknown speeding craft(s) On 11/14/19 at approximately 2104 hours PST (2204 MST Bullhead City AZ) I observed three (3) unknown type craft(s) moving at an intense speed over Laughlin, NV, in a south, southewest direction.  OBSERVATION:  While I was sitting in my vehicle parked in a open lot in Bullhead City, AZ at coordinates N 35°10.070' W 114°33.808' at elevation: 527 Feet per my Garmin GPS, I suddenly observed approx three (3) unknown type aerial vehicle/craft(s) moving at an intense speed, over Laughlin, NV, and appeared to be just above Laughlin area Casino(s), from my vantage point in Bullhead City, AZ, over Aquarius & Riverside Casino(s).  The unknown type craft where barely visible, almost equivalent to a mouse cursor moving across a computer screen at a fast paste.  I attempted to immediately, retrieve my Simmons binoculars 10x42, and with my common-sense articulation and judgment followed the trajectory of the unknown 3 crafts, and was still able to observe the crafts moving via binoculars observation. as I was simultaneously observing the craft taking my eyes away for the binoculars with the naked eye I was unable to observe the craft moving in a south-southeast direction.  The totality of the observations lasted less than 20 seconds. the craft appeared to be flying at low altitude vaguely visible to the naked eye. Weather conditions are cold at 64° Fahrenheit with broken clouds that appear to be at high altitude with somewhat of a full moon in the Northeast sky opposite of where I observed such crafts traveling in the western sky of my observation.  While observing the unknown 3 type crafts, it appeared to look like a triangle, with one light in the lead and the other two further back, as if they were trailing the lead in the front. I'm quite certain that a cell phone camera or video camera would not have captured what I observe with my eyes, the light of a craft were extremely dim or vague and appearance.  I also took a cell phone camera picture of my sitting observations, after the objects cleared the vicinity, available upon request, if needed.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
