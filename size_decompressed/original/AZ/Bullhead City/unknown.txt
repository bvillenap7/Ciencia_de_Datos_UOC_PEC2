Smoke trails from object in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2007-08-12 10:30:00;2 mins;Smoke trails from object in sky I was driving down Hwy 95 heading South to go to the store. We have an airport and the planes fly really low over the Bullhead Parkway to land. Well I happen to look up over the airport and noticed a small object in the sky. It looked like it was a far off plane but what I noticed that made me slow down was blackish smoke trailing behind it. My first thought was a small plane in jeopardy and was waiting for it to descend to our airport. But the object instead, flew straight up and disappeared, including the smoke that trailed behind it.  I tried to look for it but it was just gone. I couldn't make out any particular shape. All I really saw was a silvery glow of metal. I am wondering if anyone else saw this too.

Observed a fast pace faintly lit orange colored unknown object in the night sky...;2019-04-27 03:51:00;5-10 seconds;Observed a fast pace faintly lit orange colored unknown object in the night sky... SOURCE OF ACTIVITY:  On April 27, 2019, at approximately 0351 hours in the City of Bullhead City, Arizona (Mohave County)  I REDACTED: I stepped out of my residence pedestrian door facing a southern direction to “get some air” while observing the nightly lit shy with a clear and unobstructed view, I  immediately observed a unknown aerial object moving at a extremely fast pace. OBSERVATION:  I REDACTED stepped out of my residence pedestrian door which faces a southern direction, to “get some air” immediately observed a faint then at times brightly orange colored object, that I first believed was a star, then begin to move in a very fast rate of speed. Based on my digital calibrated cell phone compass, the unknown orange colored object was observed from my point of view in a south southeastern direction at 100 to 120 degrees, based on digital compass bearing heading, while I was standing outside my residence pedestrian door in a southern direction. The unknown object appeared to be moving in a northern direction from a south southeastern point of view. The unknown object was at first extremely faint or not visible while I was spontaneously looking at the night sky. The unknown object then became more visibly lit, appearing orange in color, yet mixed but not twinkling like a star, but more steady or a type of solid visible light. The unknown object begin to originally appear “faint” then more illuminated, and was moving like a distant slow moving plane, then instantaneously accelerate in speed, nothing like a fast moving plane or normal type of plate or jet I would anticipate as adult with common sense, articulation, judgment and intelligent observational analysis with 2020 eye vision / healthy normal eyes and overall health. The unknown object speeded up so abruptly in a northern direction, that it quickly dissipated into the darkly night lit sky, lasting for approximately five (5) to ten (10) seconds in observation. I then stood outside for approximately ten (10) minutes to further observe the “calculated” trajectory based on time and observation, of the unknown object would further appear or make itself visible, and met with negative results, while fully observing the clear night sky from north to northeastern to south southeastern observation. ADDITIONAL/DISPOSITION OF OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSIS:  I have lived in major metropolitan city for most of my life and I am aware that ‘light pollution” obstructs a lot of stars in the night sky.  After living in Bullhead City, Arizona, a somewhat rural town of about 40,000 in population, the light pollution I would say with common sense is 1/10th of that compared to a major metropolitan city which would be the full 10th scale of light population. No doubt, what I observed was anything I can explain or understand.  The only reason I was able to observe such a fascinating occurrence, is because the light pollution is at a minimal. I hope wherever this report / log is submitted to, serves the individual or organization well, thank you.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
