I was out with the dogs and noticed two lights like stars in a line then all of a sudden there was three lights then four and back to two.   I tried to get them on my video camera but I just got it and I don't know how to record properly.    I took pictures and hope that they came out.    The lights were just there and then gone and came back.    I watched this for fifteen mimutes and then they were just gone.   They were white lights and then the ones in the center came from white to reddish.   They didn't move but stayed in one spot the whole time.   There was no noise and no airplanes in the sky at all.   When they disappeared it was like someone just turned them off and then the sky was dark again.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
