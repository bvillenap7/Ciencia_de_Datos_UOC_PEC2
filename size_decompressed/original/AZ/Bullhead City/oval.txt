THEN I WAITED FOR THE NOISE BUT THERE WASN'T ANY EVEN AS IT GOT CLOSER TO ME.   I NOTICED THAT WHEN IT GOT CLOSER TOWARDS ME I COULD MAKE OUT THAT IT WAS OVAL AND IT HAD FOUR BRIGHT LIGHTS ON IT,  LIKE ONE ON TOP, BOTTOM, AND EACH SIDE OF IT AND WITH A BAND OF LIGHTS THAT KEPT FLICKERING.   THE BRIGHT LIGHTS WOULD CHANGE FROM WHITE TO RED THEN TO GREEN.   BUT THE BAND OF LIGHT ALWAYS WHEN RED TO GREEN AND CONSTANT,  ALMOST LIKE A STROB LIGHT. IT SEEMED TO BE A LARGE OBJECT FROM WHAT I COULD TELL ABOUT 20 TO 30 FEET ROUND.    IT WAS HEADING TOWARDS THE NORTH THEN HEADED TOWARDS NORTH EAST THEN LIKE A SHOT TOOK OFF AND WAS GONE.  I WATCHED THIS FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
