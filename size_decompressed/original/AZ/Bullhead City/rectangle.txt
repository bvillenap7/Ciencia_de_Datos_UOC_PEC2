The stars were coming down pretty good.I saw three good ones, surprisingly one dissipated coming into the atmosphere directly at us which was rare/odd then looked south the opposite side of where the orion shower was from my porch, then out of no where a massive unbelievable white glow looked to be the size of a football field at least a thousand miles up or more. It was definitely beyond our atmosphere. It moved through space at an unknown light speed literally no more than three seconds to travel from southern hemisphere to northern while my jaw was floored. I smacked my friend in the shoulder told him look up! I  pointed up as it vanished to the north. Asked my friend did you freaking see that last glimpse of the unknown? He said yes. I said now that was a freaking unidentified flying object followed by all the curse words in the book. I don't know what is crazier the real life star wars space ! ship or the fact that the musician on sound cloud that was playing on my phone when this event occurred, was describing seeing something he had never seen in his entire life that no one would believe and a indescribable feeling.  Thank you for listening.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
