Hopefully a fragment of a comet or a meteor.  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD));2015-12-22 18:00:00;3 minutes;Hopefully a fragment of a comet or a meteor. I believe my girlfriend and I witnessed a meteor fragment enter the atmosphere between 5:55 and 6:15 p.m. on the night of December the 22nd 2015.   I was speaking to her while she sat facing the east in a SUV and kept seeing flashes of light which she claimed she did not notice.  Believing it must be someone fooling with us, we ignored my curiosity.   However within a few minutes after seeing the flashes of light, I noticed a bright object which came from the West, from California in a star burst pattern.  If you can imagine looking directly at a firework bursting before you, that is what it looked like.  The color was golden to white.  It was so large it was startling.   Being as we are so nervous about terrorists, I almost thought it was a missile, but as it neared and I shouted at her to get out of the SUV and look up at the sky it began to resemble some type of long comet or meteor soaring very close to earth on a bit of a east southeastern direction.  Or as the ! crow flies, towards Phoenix.  It remained visible until it left our horizon line or about two minutes or less.  Once she left and went home about four minutes later I heard a loud boom from the direction which it flew.  Since we both sighted flying orange red orbs over Bullhead City, Arizona, just a few months ago.  It is interesting that so many things abound in the skies around here.  I am certain it was a meteor or some space debris but it is interesting that no one is local is saying anything about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.

4 slow moving objects with colored tails traveling southeast.  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD));2015-12-22 19:12:00;30-40 seconds;4 slow moving objects with colored tails traveling southeast Witnessed four separate balls of fire entering the atmosphere. It looked just like the pictures that were shown on TV when the space shuttle fell apart entering the atmosphere. I did notice different colors in the tails directly behind each piece and each piece left vapor trails. ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD));35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
