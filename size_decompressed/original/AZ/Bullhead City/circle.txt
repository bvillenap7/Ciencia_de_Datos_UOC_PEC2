Brillant white disk shoots through night time sky in Bullhead City, AZ.;2012-12-31 01:30:00;5-6 seconds;Brillant white disk shoots through night time sky in Bullhead City, AZ. I was leaning against the back wall of the apartment complex where I live while allowing my dog time to relieve herself. I was looking up at the sky admiring the beauty of the stars that could be seen through broken cloud cover. Suddenly overhead and coming from behind a very large white object, round in shape and flat like a frisbee caming shooting over my head and forward, skipping through the clouds with tremendous speed.  As it passed through clouds the clouds were lit up. The direction from start to end of sighting was: south-west to north-east. If held at arms length a quarter would have been required to cover the size of the object. The color was a very bright white. The speed was amazing.  I am not sure a jet could have kept up with it. It did not disappear over the horizon, but rather just simply disappeared after it reach a short distance in front of my position. It was both amazing and beautiful.

UFO sighting over Rotary Park, 3 circular lights.;2017-03-23 20:25:00;30-45 seconds;UFO sighting over Rotary Park, 3 circular lights. As I was driving on Lakeside dr by Rotary park, I looked up and saw 3 orange glowing circular lights in the sky.  They were positioned in the shape of a triangle.   I slowed to a stop in the road and continued to observe the lights.  They were pulsing orange they were high in the sky and larger than any other stars or surrounding lights by more than 10 times.   I began to pull off the road to watch these lights/crafts/ufos.  I took my eyes off of them for a split second, and when I looked back, what was 3 lights was now only one.  The other two had disappeared.  I scanned the sky quickly and couldn't find them.   I continued to watch the last circular light as it pulsed orange.  It did this a few times before disappearing completely and suddenly.  This whole encounter lasted between 30-45 seconds I believe.  And it happened about 30 mins ago at this point.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133

((anonymous report));2017-11-03 20:00:00;30 seconds;I had seen a black object is all i know. with no lights and no noticible sound.  There was a soccer game at rotary park, my friend lives close by on the same street as rotary.  I was outside smoking a cigarette and looking towards the soccer game when i seen an all black object fly above the soccer game and i only saw it because it was moving fast and the lights from the soccer field reflected off the bottem of the craft until it went to far and dissapeared in the darkness . now knowing that you need lights on to fly in a city i thought this was purculer.  So about 10 minutes later my friend and i left and there was a helicopter with a search light fly the sane direction of the craft right over the park.  It then flew about half a mile more and increased altitude and stayed in the sky with its spotlight on until we drove away and i couldnt see.  Ok this seems a little much but the following 2-3 days the skies above laughlin and bullhead city had many helicopter!  like lights flying for hours in the same back and fourth areas .  there was one light in perticuler that was RED and would dim out and back on all night.

Circle of lights seen two nights in a row.;2018-05-03 21:15:00;15 minutes;Circle of lights seen two nights in a row First saw this shape with a light pattern on 5/2/18 at the same time of day.  Was able to focus a telescope on it for about 2 minutes before it vanished. On 5/3/18, I saw it again.  Sky is clear.  No moon yet.  I observed it for the full duration through the telescope.  There is a very definitive and intricate pattern to the lights. It was also moving very slowly as I had to keep adjusting the scope. I was able to record approximately 20 seconds of video and got one decent picture using an iPhone. From the north end of Bullhead City and just east of the airport, the scope is aimed to 300 degrees and 4 degrees up from horizontal. The light pattern has been visible the last two nights. Without moving the scope from last nightâ€™s viewing, I looked through it this morning and all I could see was clear sky.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
