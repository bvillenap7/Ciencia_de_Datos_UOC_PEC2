Star-like object, moving ENE, emitting bright flashes.;2015-09-29 19:50:00;.30 minute;Star-like object, moving ENE, emitting bright flashes. On September 29th, around 7:50 p.m., I walked down our steps and looked up to the sky, as I am an avid sky watcher.  I quickly noticed what appeared to be a very bright star at 140 degrees S.E. and 60 degrees off the horizon.  I know a bright star should not be in this location.                                                                                  I watched for about 30 seconds, and it dimmed by about 75% and started moving slowly north.  After 10 minutes the object was about 80 degrees west and 70 degrees off the horizon.   I ran inside to get my binoculars and when I got back outside it took me about 5 minutes to find the object again as it had dimmed again to a point barely visible to the naked eye.  The object was about 40 degrees N.E. and still 70 degrees off the horizon.   At that moment, a bright flash came from the object.  It was as if a large camera flashed.  I followed the object with my binoculars as it moved E.N.E.  Slowly, and every minute or so, the object flashed brightly.  In all, I saw eight flashes as the object moved E.N.E. and out of my sight.    The sighting lasted about 30 minutes.  I wrote the details of this sighting down that evening, as well as the compass readings.  My binoculars are 10x50 power and all compass readings are from magnetic north.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
