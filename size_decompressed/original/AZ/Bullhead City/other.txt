I ran out to see a group of people gathered looking up at an object sitting completely still above the Colorado River.  The craft had the shape of a doughnut with a hole directly through it.  That was the middle of the day and the craft could be clearly seen.  It hovered I'd say only a few hundred feet above the river. 500 tops.  There was a series of lights flashing from the bottom of the craft with hues ranging from blue to orange to redish.  As the group of onlookers watched,  This group consisting of mostly grown women and some men, the object sped away following the river towards needles CA, or Kingman, AZ, direction.  It moved so quickly it was virtually instant.  I would guess several thousand miles per hour.  From what I remember the newspaper tried explaining it away but to be honest can't really r! ecall as it was so long ago and I was so young.  There is no doubt however in my mind that this craft was not of this world and I am not alone.  I'd love to find more information on this sighting. It's something that has been with me for years and yet I've never heard it mentioned on any programs or anything, and this has been odd to me being that it was such an amazing, clear sighting, and that many people witnessed it.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133

We were outside and noticed two lines in the sky coming straight down close to each other and they were black in color.   It almost appeared to be smoke except they didn't disapate they remained in a set position.   It lasted for about ten minutes and then there was nothing.   They were side by side coming from about twelve o'clock to six o'clock,   and they were pretty straight.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
6 objects moved from south to north with no flashing lights towards Las Vegas. (area 51?);2004-04-07 09:00:00;30 seconds;6 objects moved from south to north with no flashing lights towards Las Vegas. (area 51?) I was looking at the planet Venus around 9 p.m. when six very dim lights  moved from south to north at a very fast pace.  I had binoculars and others did not, but one other saw the lights wich were very dim and no flashing lights to indicate they were aricraft. I thought they were probably headed towards area 51. Have no idea what I saw, but they were not usual aricraft.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
Redish erratic light over Bullhead City, AZ/Laughlin NV.;2004-04-07 20:05:00;10 Min.;Redish erratic light over Bullhead City, AZ/Laughlin NV. At the said time and date, my wife and I were driving home. Almost nearly home, we noticed a fairly bright light on an object directly in front of us (North of our position.) At first, I dismissed it as a helicopter or a fixed wing airplane. Within 30 seconds of watching the object, what appeared to be the wing of the craft was illuminated by the bright singular light of the object. The wing appeared from our position that of an air plane in a hard bank. So the wing was straight up and down and was not hiding the large singular light, nor was it effecting the intensity of the light. At this time, my wife called her mother and had her look from her location which was only a few blocks away north of our position. Useless for triangulation. She attempted to get her video camera set up, but was unable to do so during the short time span. Gauging distance would be difficult, but I would guess it would be no more than 5 miles away. There was absolutely no sound. There was no wind whatsoever, yet the object looked as if it were drifting in a large circle, hung from a cable from high above. The object displayed no vertical movement. It appeared to keep the same altitude as it drifted to the West. At times it would stop making its pivoting circles, and hold in one location. From my position, it would appear as if the craft while drifting West would slow down, and head back East, then go back west. It would slow as it reached the edge of it's circular pivot. I've used and seen many types of flares, and this was no flare. For one, if it was a flare, it didn't do a very good job at illuminating the ground. No smoke was seen near the object either. Plus, the lack of vertical movement makes me skeptical. I kept wanting to think it was a hot air balloon dangling a light below it. That's the speed and impression the object gave me. There were no strobe lights that I could see. The single light was much brighter than the evening star which was present just to the West. The light was a dim redish color that tended to flicker slightly. The size of the light from my position was aprox. 10 times larger than the Evening star. When the object disapeared, the light simply went out as if you flipped a switch. This alone eliminates any type of commercial traffic. My only theory is it could be ball lightning, some type of flare, unknown military or alien craft. We did have non-producing thunder storms in the area earlier in the day. I can't explain the cable or the wing structure above the light either. That kind of eliminates ball lightning. For me, I'm a trained observer, and work security for the Federal Government at a local facility. I have an interest in aviation and military equipment. I've never seen a UFO before, since I was always able to find a credible answer for whatever I saw. On a side note, during the event, it sounded as if a large number of people were outside looking at it. Also, I heard some tires screaching off in the distance. This object definately had peoples attention. We're used to low flying air craft up some fairly large commercial jets overhead since the International Laughlin Airport is aprox. 5 miles away. No other aircraft were present in the area during the event. You may contact me through e-mail if you need any more information.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
Hello, I reported an event on 4/7/2004 20:05, an identical event took place yet again in almost the exact same area as the previous eve;2005-10-15 21:25:00;20 Minutes;Hello, I reported an event on 4/7/2004 20:05, an identical event took place yet again in almost the exact same area as the previous event. At 2125 hrs., my wifes mother called her and informed her of an object in the sky north of our position in Bullhead City.  This put the object directly over Laughlin, Nevada.  She indicated that it was visible since at least 2120 hrs. We continued watching the object until aprox. 2134 hrs. when it moved north east from its origional position.  At the time the object faded out and disapeared.  This happened extremely quick. We went back inside at that time.  About 2138 hrs., her mother contacted us on the phone yet again and indicated that the object was back and was now much closer and moving at a much higher rate of speed.  At this time, I took two pictures of the object which unfortunately came out extremely blurry. At this time, the object appeared to be in a large spiral towards the ground.  The object disapeared behind some houses out of sight and was not seen again.  It is unknown if the object made contact with the ground or not.  We left and traveled to the river to get a clear view of the area it would have landed, but were unable to witness anything. The object was a reddish color.  The size was spherical, but appeared to be attached on a pendulum in the way its motion was preceived. There was no wind present, so the lateral movement would not be plausable to move a flare around to the extend that occured. I can provide the photos if needed, however the quality is extremely poor. Another issue that may or may not be related to this case is the portable phone my wife was using was acting up.  Normally, the phone is good at the distance we were from the base station. Air traffic was present in the surrounding area, although they were up above 30,000 feet.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
Meteorite falls in Mohave County Arizona, bright flash observed over horizon.;2009-04-25 23:03:00;5 Seconds;Meteorite falls in Mohave County Arizona, bright flash observed over horizon. On April 25, 2009 at 23:03 Hours, I was driving home from my place of work on Highway 68.  I was heading eastbound towards Kingman, Az.  . I was approximately one mile West of Landon Drive. Just past the last run away truck ramp. Directly in front of me, I observed what appeared to be a very large shooting star near the horizon line directly in front of me (Over the black mountains.) The falling star was very bright and lasted for approximately three seconds. It appeared to be falling in and West to East direction. The coloration of the falling star was a bright greenish color. The falling star appeared to pass behind the mountain range from my point of view. Approximately one or two seconds later, I observed a large flash that illuminated the eastern horizon behind the mountains for less than a second. The flash was similar to heat lighting. This lead me to believe that the object actually struck the ground.  Or, can falling meteorites cause lightning bursts?  The sky was clear all day, and I observed no lightning prior.;35.0817421686747;-114.578445783133
