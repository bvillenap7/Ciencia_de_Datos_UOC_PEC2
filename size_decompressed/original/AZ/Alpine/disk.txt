Many times after it did those impossible manuvers it would pause several seconds. Once it made it to 2500 ft. it suddenly reversed back to close to its original position so fast that it was a bright blur to the eyes and vanished. My dad was a pilot at the time and I was a student of airplanes for years we both watched  the whole thing and still refer to that camping trip every time we meet.;33.8253;-109.1245
