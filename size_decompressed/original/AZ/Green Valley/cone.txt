Small round object hovering over Green Valley, AZ.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus, or a lens flare.  PD));2016-12-12 16:30:00;unk;Small round object hovering over Green Valley, AZ. I took a picture in the SSW sky of a beautiful cloud formation and noticed two days later that there was a small round object in the picture.  When it was enlarged, the detail was very clear.  It had 8 equally spaced dots on the periphery and 4 lighted dots in the interior of the circle.  It appeared to be hovering.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus, or a lens flare.
