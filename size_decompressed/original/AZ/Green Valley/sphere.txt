Looking through my windshield at about one o'clock at an approximate altitude of 3 to 4 thousand feet, as I entered the round about they when south at a great speed. I was able to pull over on W Canoa Rd and saw them in the south scattered and intermittently flashing and randomly flitting from here to there.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
