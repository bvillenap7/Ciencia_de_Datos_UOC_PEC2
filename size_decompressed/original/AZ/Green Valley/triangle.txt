I watched these lights for maybe two or three minutes, then they quickly picked up speed and altitute disappearing over the mountains near madera canyon.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
Overfly of I-19 of triangle shaped-three light object;2005-02-24 21:45:00;4 minutes;Overfly of I-19 of triangle shaped-three light object As we were coming home from a trip to New Mexico, I spotted three bright blue-white lights almost directly infront of me on a frontage road along I-19. They appeared to be moving very slowly and maybe 50-75 feet off the ground in relation to telephone poles nearby. They continued moving slowly across I-19 heading East to West , then abruptly picked up speed , then altitude. they were completely out of sight on the Western horizon about 1 minute after this abrupt speed and altitude change happened. After getting over the shock, we both remember that there was a faint outline of a straight wing or structure on one side of the object. I opened my drives side window and heard zero motor noise from the object(s).  My wife then told me of her previous sighting a previous night of the same three blue-white lights heading in the opposite direction over mountains in the southeast.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373

Saw craft over the hills to the East far off in the distance. Craft appeard to remain very stationary, or or times to drift very slowly upward and off toward the South. Saw three lights. 1 at the top and two at the bottom, forming a triangle. Light on the bottom right hand side appeared to flash mostly red while top light and bottom left light appeared to change color, remaining mostly amber.  All lights flashed or pulsed. Flashes appeared to change in duration of pulses and color of lights, so that lights appear two twinkle. Seemed sometimes to wink out entirely.  There is a mine in operation over there but this light appeared to be above the hillside rather than on top of it. Please note that we are just to the North of the Mt. Whipple Observatory. Update. 19:24 object is still out there. 19:33 just had my son come out and look at the object and her also saw it and saw it move. 19:41 moving directly up and toward the East imperceptibly slowly. 19:44. Still there but stopped watching. Note: Saw possible companion craft much higher in elevation and much farther away a bit to the North. This object looked like a star but flashed very brightly once in a great while very brightly like a flash bulb. Hard to know if this was a star or just what it was.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373

Triangular craft blended into the sky on Oct. 24th in Green Valley AZ, the cut out appearance of sky moved south along the I-19.;2019-10-24 05:05:00;5 minutes;Triangular craft blended into the sky on Oct. 24th in Green Valley AZ, the cut out appearance of sky moved south along the I-19. On our 5:00 AM walk, my husband stopped and pointed to the sky. He had seen a triangular craft enter the sky. He describes it as similar to a crocodile surfacing in black water. He was not sure if it had lights or if it was just reflection from the highway. It was over the I-19 freeway about a quarter mile high. It emerged near Duval Mine Road and the I-19. shortly after it entered, it blended into the sky.  I missed the initial entry. When I saw it, it looked like a piece of the night sky had been cut out and was moving south. It was large, about the size of our house. There was no noise. At first I thought maybe it was a large owl, but there is no way. I watched the piece of the sky move slowly for about 4 or 5 minutes until it disappeared to the south of us.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
