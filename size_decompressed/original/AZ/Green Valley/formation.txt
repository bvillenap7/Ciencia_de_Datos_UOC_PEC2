dim cluster of lights over southern arizona;2006-07-08 23:00:00;10 minutes;dim cluster of lights over southern arizona I was on my back patio which faces west, when I noticed what appeared to be 2 starlike objects slowly floating east just above the horizon, moving up.  its position in the sky was near where saturn set and it moved east/southeast toward the star arcturus.  it then changed direction about 20 degrees above the horizon and moved south toward saturn.  i then realized it was not a satellite or planes flying in formation since there is an airforce base nearby.  i am a novice amateur astronomer so i ran inside an got my 4 inch telescope to see if i could resolve what it was.  through my telescope i followed it for another 5 minutes as it moved north of scopio and out of view to the east.  it consisted of one bright blueish light which i estimate to be of the 3rd magnitude with a small cluster of fainter blue and red lights just above it.  it appeared to wobble as it moved.  the only thing i could compare its movement to is possibly a large cluster of party balloons with a lantern or other light source tethered to it.  which, is what it could have been, only the location where it rose from is desolate, uninhabited desert.  as i said before, i am an amateur astronomer.  i have spent many hours looking at the night sky.  i have 2 telescopes, a 4 inch refractor, and an 8 inch SCT.  i am 31 years old and of sound mind.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
Eliptical craft/formation sighted over Green Valley, Arizona 5am 8/12/06;2006-08-12 05:00:00;15 minutes;Eliptical craft/formation sighted over Green Valley, Arizona 5am 8/12/06 Early dawn. No stars visible in sky. Through front room window facing East I saw a bright Eliptical shaped light low in the Eastern sky just above neighbor's roof. Resembled aircraft with red and green running lights. Saw red and green light in flashes. Object was not travelling across sky but appeared stationary.Ran outside to end of the block at Esperanza Blvd. and W. Paseo Solana to observe looking Northeast. Object Rose almost imperceptibly slowly in the sky to a greater height gradually changing shape and size,to a round shape,the back to somewhat of an elipse, growing smaller and larger and smaller again (very slowly)  until it appeared to my perspective as a pinpoint of light, like a large star. At this point I saw that there was another identical craft in a line directly beneath the first one but at a lower altitude.These lights did not pulse but remained at a steady luminosity. Second craft only observed during the pinpoint of light phase. Second craft was observed for a good period of time and was definitely present and was not a reflection or trick of the light.Importantly, My position was in very close proximity to the Mt. Whipple observatory atop Mt. Hoplins,directly to the South. Running lights were no longer able to be observed from my perspective when the craft had reached these higher altitudes. Craft apparently were travelling up and away toward the Northeast from my position, since Light apeared to grow smaller, grow larger, get smaller again and then wink out. Observed phenomenon for a good 10 to fifteen minutes from around 5:05 to 5:20 am from  when I came in and imediately noted my impressions. Have previously witnessed Belgium triangular style craft over Marcola Hills (Springfield) in southern Oregon in fall of 1997, and had quick glimpse of boomerang wing craft over this location last year.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
Formation of small wite lights moving across the sky;2019-03-19 19:30:00;1 minute;Formation of small wite lights moving across the sky My wife and I were driving home in our golf cart and saw a group of small white lights moving across the sky from west to east.  The lights moved across I-19 and moved out of sight quickly.  There was no noise.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
