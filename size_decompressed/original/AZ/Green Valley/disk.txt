At the stated date and time, I noticed a brilliant cloud formation that caught my eye.  I stopped and gazed up to the SSW and took a picture of the angelic cloud shapes.  Two days later, I looked at my phone camera pictures and noticed a small round object in the sky on this shot.  I enlarged it and was astonished as the detail and amazing symmetry.  I am most interested in finding out what are the possibilities. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested permission to view the photo, but have not yet received a copy of the image.
