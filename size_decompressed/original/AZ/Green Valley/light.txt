Looked up in the night sky to the North and saw a series of strobe lights stationary in the sky (looked like 5 or six lights in a series) fairly low in the horizon.  As I watched a second set appeared out of nowhere and started strobing.  Both sets then strobed at once and then they both  just vanished. Did not see them move off.  They just vanished. No sound or other characteristics from the list accompanied this siting.  Lasted for about 1 minute total.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
Bright light orb.;2014-08-12 13:30:00;10 seconds;Bright light orb This incident happened on August 12, 2014 at about 1:30 PM. I work at a molybdenum mine south of Tucson, AZ.   My co-worker was operating a D10 Caterpillar dozer on one of our waste dumps at an elevation of about 4300 ft.  He was doing something on his I-phone when he glanced in his mirror and thought he saw the lights of a haul truck coming to dump a load.  It took only a moment for him to realize the light was not attached to anything.  At this point he turned in his seat and saw a bright light coming right at him, and had the good sense to take a picture of it with his phone.  When he took the picture the object moved off at a high rate of speed across the open pit of the mine.   The second picture was taken approximately two seconds after the first and he estimates by this time the object was two miles away over another waste dump.  The photos were taken out the back and side windows of the dozer and the suns position was just about overhead. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect the report is reliable, and two photos, showing a very bright object, were forwarded to our Center by the source.  We will post the photos.  PD));31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
Bright light under the moon viewed from Green Valley;2015-03-23 20:30:00;a few days now;Bright light under the moon viewed from Green Valley For the past few nights we've seen a briliant bright white light under the moon in the night sky, and we're wondering what it is.  It doesn't appear to be moving (like a plane), but is in a different position every night.   We are curious, because it just doesn't seem right.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
Gigantic, glowing, sphere of light.   ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 19:30:00;20 minutes;25 miles south of Tucson.   ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD)) Bright white light emerges on cloudless clear night like the moon breaking out of clouds.  The light gets very bright and well defined like a bare clear spotlight bulb.  Then the center bright definition turns into a gigantic glowing sphere of light filling a area in the sky that would fill the area of outstretched arms spread apart  6 inches outside of body.  Huge.  Then it stayed that way for 10 min and then slowly drifted away over another 10-15 min.   This glowing sphere of light was very bright and well defined.  There were no aircraft lights or movements.  It was at an elevation of maybe 30 degrees off the horizon..  We have pictures but they don't show the clarity of the actual event.  One of the witnesses is a retired NASA engineer.  We are close to the border, and an airforce base.  We see helicopters and jets all the time.  This was not either.  We also saw a faint beam of light going to the ground from the side of the sphere for awhile. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Huge brilliant blue'ish white light over the desert, west of Green Valley AZ.,  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2017-12-22 19:00:00;10 minutes;Huge brilliant blueish white light over the desert, west of Green Valley AZ.,  Around seven pm..it lit up a huge dome or bubble, that lo9ked to be about 50 miles in diameter.  It moved slowly from north to south untill I lost sight of it l, because of tree's obstructing my view.  The blue white light was still visible for several minute's after i lost sight of the object. It looked like a comet, or what came to my mind was a silver seed.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Vandenberg AFB @ 5:26 p.m..  PD));31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
Date is approximate, and viewed a similar event about two weeks before this one, but in different part of the sky.;2018-03-15 23:00:00;6 seconds;Date is approximate, and viewed a similar event about two weeks before this one, but in different part of the sky. I stepped out of my casita to check weather and look at the stars about 2300 hours. (I did this most nights when wintering in Arizona.)  Weather was clear no clouds.  I was looking west/northwest and at an angle of about 50 degrees watched a small, bright white light blink on and off very quickly followed in one second or so by a much brighter light which lasted only a second.  When the second flash of light ended, I noticed a very dim group of white lights in a triangular pattern move from right to left where the light was just a second ago.  The individual lights were very small, perhaps as small (or smaller) than a small star, and the entire triangular pattern would have been entirely covered by the the fingernail on my pinky finger held at arm's length, so if that light pattern indicated a vehicle, that vehicle was at a great altitude which I'm estimating at 30,000 feet. About two weeks before this event, I witnessed only one bright light blink on and then off in about 1 second and at an angle of about 35-40 degree while I was looking directly south. There was only that one light during that event, and I noticed no triangular pattern of lights after the flash. I noticed no sound during either event. I checked to see if a rocket had been launched in California at the time of the event mentioned first above, but I don't believe a rocket was launched at that time. I am a retired industrial sales manager who winters in Arizona for a couple of months each year.  I have good eyesight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
