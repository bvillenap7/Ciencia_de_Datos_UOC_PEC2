Last month sitting on my porch I looked up and there was an bright rectanglar amber light not to far away or very high in the sky. It seemed to have 3 dark rings in it and after about 5 seconds it slowly faded out. Fifteen seconds later it slowly came back on for 5 seconds and then slowly faded out again. I stood up to look closer because there was no sound or flashing lights which all airplanes have. It just disappeared. Then about a week later my nephew and I saw the same lights, this time there were two, at a distance and both slowly came on for 5 seconds and slowly went out. They had to be about a mile apart yet they both did this at exact the same time. They did it 4 times then they were gone. Then on the 6-25-02 three of us on the porch saw the same lights come on over Greenvalley. Not very high in the sky they slowly came on and went out several times. Then it came on and before it went completly out another one would start coming on beside it and before it went completly out another one would come on beside it and so on. There were 5 of them. At first I thought that it was just one light moving accross the sky but then realized that before the first light went out the second one was coming on. Greenvalley is west of my home and to the north is an AF base. After I saw the lights on the 25th a small plane came from the direction of the AF base and flew around in circles over Greenvalley for 30 minutes then returned to the base. I feel some one saw this besides me and they were checking it out.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
