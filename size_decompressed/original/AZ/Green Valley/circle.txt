Had I not watched the Peter Jennings report, I probably would not have reported this to anyone!;2002-04-09 20:00:00;45 secs.;Had I not watched the Peter Jennings report, I probably would not have reported this to anyone! It appeared in the dark sky as a bright orange circle (very similiar to the sun setting on a hot summers night!)  As we watched it, it let off four (4) smaller circles (bright orange) off the lower right and as all were in complete view everything suddenly vanished.  My Dad had checked the evening news and the morning paper and nothing was said about this.  However, at the breakfastroom at the motel we were staying at in Green Valley, we had a comment from a neighboring breakfast couple stating that You saw that too???. AWESOME!

Sighted 3 unidentified objects in triangular formation over Green Valley, Arizona;2012-06-18 22:00:00;3 minutes;Sighted 3 unidentified objects in triangular formation over Green Valley, Arizona Saw three crafts, spaced well apart in a straight line and at the same altitude cross the sky at high altitude moving west to east.  All 3 appeared as bright white dots that were strobing simultaneously with each other.  Pulses were at about 1 second intervals.  At certain point they formed a triangle in and then appeared to drop lose altitude together, remaining in the triangular configuration until we lost sight of them behind hills and objects at ground level.  No engine noise whatever accompanied this event.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
