Group of 2 or 3 colored lights attached to a triangle in a square shape.;2007-12-31 00:40:00;15 min. ??;Group of 2 or 3 colored lights attached to a triangle in a square shape. Sighted directly south of my house. Approximately a square of 4 yellow/orange lights in the outside ring/square. Possibly 2/3 blue lights behind these lights it was apparent these lights were behind the 4 yellow-orange lights as it seemed there was a triangular structure holding everything together.  I am an amateur astronomer, on the board of the Sonoran Astronomical Society and outside every night starting at 11:00 PM.  I have seen planes (Border Patrol), helicopters (military from D-M Air Base), commercial aircraft, comets, MIR, etc., etc.  You get the idea.  I also know a couple of the astronomers working up the mountain at Whipple Observatory.  I called them today to see what they had to say.  Nobody on the mountain does astronomy anymore sitting at the telescopes.  They all sit looking at computer screens.  So, nobody saw anything.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373

Two small orbs seen between the Moon and Venus.;2020-03-28 19:00:00;15 minutes;Two small orbs seen between the Moon and Venus. A small slow moving orb was viewed to the right of the Moon an hour after dusk.  It disappeared above Venus.  A second orb was viewed through a telescope shortly after the first viewing.  It was located south of the Moon, traveling faster than the first orb, and was moving diagonally between the Moon and Venus before it disappeared.;31.8503392156863;-111.019178431373
