Strange craft, military jets chase and plasma arcs in the AZ desert.;2009-11-09 18:10:00;15 Min;Strange craft, military jets chase and plasma arcs in the AZ desert. Heading home from Phoenix, we proceeded onto I10 east bound towards Tucson, we took on ramp 211. Traveling SE on I10, right upon merging I noticed a bright disk glowing white, red and blue.  I estimate it was at around 40~50 thousand feet.  I immediately check my iphone application to see if there were any planets visible.  I did notice that Jupiter was directly due south at an alt of 40 degrees.  This light source was due east over what I would estimate to be over San Manuel, AZ.  After 10 minutes of my wife and I observing this light, we noticed the flashing strobes from military aircraft either from Davis Monthan AFB or the Guard Unit at Tucson International.  The military aircraft moved fast towards the craft, which hovered the whole time.  When the military craft approached, the craft rose up immediately and disappeared into the darkness. We noted times, places and conditions.  Then we starting thinking about an interesting sighting my wife and I experienced much earlier in our trip.  We were heading east on I10 near milepost 170 due south of Phoenix when I looked to the west, admiring the sunset (5:25pm), when I noticed what appeared to be a plasma arc about a few miles from the highway, which blinded me.  My wife asked me what I saw and I pointed in the direction.  Then a few seconds later the plasma arc showed itself again.  The arc appeared to be in the direction of AZ347, but prior to reaching it. I work for an airline and am familiar with altitudes, various aircraft and their capabilities.  What we say this day was nothing I've ever seen before.  We live near Davis Monthan AFB in Tucson and are exposed to military aircraft on a daily basis.  The craft we say was not military or private.  Nothing I know of moved as fast and disappears from military jets with such ease.;32.7509;-111.5833
