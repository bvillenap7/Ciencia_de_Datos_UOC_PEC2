Unknown object over Eloy, Arizona.  Daytime sighting.;2014-12-10 13:03:00;4 minutes;Unknown object over Eloy, Arizona.  Daytime sighting. At 1:03 pm, Arizona time, witness strange shaped object consisting of three outer cylinders attached to a shorter center cylinder, approximately the size of a Hot Air Balloon, hovering over farm fields in Eloy, AZ.   The object was bright yellow in appearance and I could see no form of propulsion (i.e. engines, propellers, etc).   It hovered for about 4 minutes, and then I noticed a jet and a couple airplanes coming from the direction of Pinal Air Park (Air National Guard base) and the object then left, going away from me, fairly quickly.  By the time the jet and planes arrived, it was long gone.;32.7509;-111.5833
