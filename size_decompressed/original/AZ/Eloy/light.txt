Three night lights in triangle formation, hovering over AZ town before slowly moving off on 3/23/19;2019-03-23 21:30:00;5 minutes;Three night lights in triangle formation, hovering over AZ town before slowly moving off on 3/23/19 I was driving east bound, having turned off AZ 84, when I spotted 3 bright lights in the night sky.  The lights were white with some shall bits of blue and appeared circular in shape.  Initially they were in an arrow tip formation, with one being in the middle and the other two on its left and right sides.  There is very little air pollution in this area. As I was driving I couldnâ€™t immediately stop to video these lights.  By the time I was able to stop the light on the left side of the formation was completely gone I did not see it move off in any direction, it was just gone.  The light at the middle hovered the entire time as I videoed the light that was on the right side slowly circle and then move off to the west.  Eventually that light disappeared and I moved back to Video the light that had been in the middle, hovering.  It started to slowly move to the northeast direction until it, too, disappeared. The whole incident, from me noticing the lights, during videoing time and them moving off and disappearing was approximately 7-9 minutes.  It was a clear night with no clouds or wind or dust. I was alone while I witnessed these lights. I am a 54-year old female, attorney, with no history of any previous unexplained objects encounters.  I have in my possession two videos, one being nearly 5-minutes long of the light moving off to the west and a shorter one (approximately 1.5 minutes long) video of the light that was originally in the middle of the formation move off to the north-east.  I comment on this video that this particular light was stationery for nearly 5-minutes while I videoed the other light.  Both videos are grainy but the lights are visible.;32.7509;-111.5833
