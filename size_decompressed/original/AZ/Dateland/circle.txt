Hovering Light Formation in Southwest Arizona in March 1997;1997-03-13 22:00:00;10 Minutes;Hovering Light Formation in Southwest Arizona in March 1997 Myself and two other friends were driving from Phoenix to San Diego on the evening of March 13th 1997.  As we were traveling west on Interstate 8, approximately 1 hour from Yuma, AZ, we saw some weird hovering lights (approximately 9:30pm local time) in the southern sky that looked like they were 2-5 miles away.  The lights were white and in some sort of circle formation and didn’t seem to move as they were in our sight while driving for about 10 minutes. The lights were about 1-2 miles off of the ground.  We jokingly said that they may be UFOs, but dismissed it as some military exercise, but we didn’t know. I have thought about this for a long time and not until last week did I start to put it all together.  I was watching a program on Discovery or one of those channels last week on the Phoenix UFOs in March 1997.  After some more research, I found out that the incident happened on March 13, 1997.  I wondered if that happened to be the night in which we drove to San Diego.  I remembered that our trip happened on the first night of the 1997 NCAA Basketball because we were so surprised that we were able to watch the late games when we arrived in San Diego because of the 1 hour time change from Arizona to California.  I looked on the internet, and sure enough, the first night of the Men’s 1997 NCAA Basketball tournament was March 13th.  I am still not sure what it is that we saw.;32.7938;-113.5392

Two circular yellowish-orange lights under the moon - in line with eachother.  The UFO on rights light dimmed as if vanishing - then seconds later the UFO that was on the left did the same.  We're traveling on I-8 outside of dateland, az.;32.7938;-113.5392
