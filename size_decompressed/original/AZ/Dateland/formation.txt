Orb formation.;2015-02-05 20:15:00;35 minutes;Orb formation. Friday, ((sic.  Thursday)) feb 5th, 2015, 8:15 pm, on interstate 8 between Gila Bend and Yuma Driving west on I-8 toward Yuma.  Me and my Partner saw three glowing orbs about 5 miles south of us at aprox. 100 meters up.  They hovered for about 5 mins, then quickly shot downwards and exploded into a cone of yellow light.  No sound was heard, and no debris or dust was observed.   this then repeated two more times with the three orbs appearing then shooting down and exploding.   we were taken aback and thought maby they could have been some kind of munition and then things got stranger still.  right after this sequence we saw two orbs appear static in the air at about 1000 meters.   then two more equidistant forming a square . no movement just stayed put.   then four more appeared forming  another perfect square for a total of 8.   we pulled off the road at exit 85 to watch what was going on.  three planes flew into the airspace just going around and around the lights. they were orange/amber orbs almost translucent.  they stayed in formation about 20 mins the disappeared.;32.7938;-113.5392
