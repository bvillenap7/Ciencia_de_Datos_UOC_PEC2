Low flying object on a straight southern trajectory with a heavy glowing trail.   ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of missile launch??  PD));2017-12-22 18:40:00;3 minutes;low flying object on a straight southern trajectory with a heavy glowing trail coming out of a large, low, brightly glowing 'cloud' Driving on Hwy 191 S. nearing the turn off to Dragoon Rd.,We saw a rocket type object flying fairly low in an otherwise dark sky.  It appeared as a bright dot with a huge glow arching above, below and behind it as it travelled South in a straight trajectory.  It had a heavy tail that glowed brightly and led back to a bright cloud formation well to the North. It passed behind the Dragoon mountains and out of view but we continued to see the glow above the mountains as it progressed.  I have photos, though they don't represent how bright it was, and they also show 2 additional bright lights alongside it that we didn't see.   Perhaps it was a rocket?  We are not knowledgeable with that kind of thing.  Still, I'd like to know. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of missile launch.  PD));32.025;-110.0459
