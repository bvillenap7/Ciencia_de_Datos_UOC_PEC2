Seeing a Group of shiny UFO's while a Military plane flies low;2005-09-19 15:00:00;At least 3-5 Minutes from;Seeing a Group of shiny UFO's while a Military plane flies low My brother and I were driving back from the Store when we noticed a large Military looking airplane that was flying so low it looked like it was going to land.  Then we looked above the Airplane and in the distance we saw around 5 or 6 really shiny diskshaped looking lights in the sky.  They appeared to be in a group.  It was really cool! I was so happy and I pointed at them and said Their are UFO's!!!  My brother siad: Yeah I see them too!  We kept looking at them when we stopped at the Stop Sign, and then they were just gone.  I have no idea where the Military looking plane went - it might have landed but I am sure it was aware of the LIGHTS as well. I've been looking outside continuously since then hoping to see them again haha.;32.025;-110.0459
