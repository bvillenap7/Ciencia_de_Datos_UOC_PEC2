Black craft over Grand Canyon/white craft over Beverly Hills.;2013-02-23 11:00:00;1 minute;Black craft over Grand Canyon/white craft over Beverly Hills I was returning from a business trip with two colleagues on Alaska Airlines from DC to LA.  Over the Grand Canyon, I saw a black craft shaped like a bullet going at an amazing speed in the opposite direction very close to our airplane leaving a trail of thick black smoke behind it.   A few minutes later, an identical craft with the same black trail went by.  I would concede it may have been a military plane, but thing that bothers me is that the smoke trail dissipated at the exact same speed as the craft, as if it were a part of it.  If a military plane were emitting black smoke from burning oil, it would have left a trail across the sky.   What my friends couldn't see because I was in the window seat is just before the second craft left my view, I saw it tilt upward and the black smoke trail disappeared in a split second. The crazier part of the story is that when I returned home, I was telling my son the story while looking out the window of our home in Beverly Hills, CA.  I saw two brilliant white planes flying towards us.  I didn't think anything of it until the one on the right just disappeared, then the one on the left made a perfectly tight loop in the air, then disappeared.  It was a manoeuvre that would be impossible with a plane, and it was close enough that I could tell it was not a helicopter.   This was at about 3pm on 2/24/13.   And that's my UFO story.
