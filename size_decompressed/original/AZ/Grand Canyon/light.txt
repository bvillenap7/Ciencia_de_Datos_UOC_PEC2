Approx.3:pm 4/19/04 Hermit house overlook. bright reflection ( like a soap bubble ) was seen circling below the observation point, stopping briefly from time to time, as my wife began to take in the beautifull view. I turned toward her as she said what is that? She directed my attention to the object, which I viewed through 12X50 binoculars.as I watched the object I saw a bright flashing light moveing towards us in the canyon below,within 1 mile of our location. my wife began filming with her sony digital 8 handycam (20x optical)set to 40x magnification. We have 25 seconds of film showing ...something moveing and turning into a side canyon with shadows visible below the object ,it appears to change direction and speed . I saw two hikers on the trail below the vertical cliff on the left before seeing the object, and looked for them during and after the event,they were gone and I could no longer see them below us. I watched the edge of the canyon ridge but did not see the object depart. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual via telephone.  He asserts that the object was below the distant horizon, and probably was within one mile of the observers.  We are awaiting the photo.  PD));35.9423;-112.1259

((NUFORC Note:  We do not know whether this is intended as a serious report.  We have requested more information from the source.  We received a pulse of seemingly non-serious reports from the Grand Canyon area, and we suspect that they may be an orchestrated attempt by a group of youth to mislead us.  PD));35.9423;-112.1259
