While at our campsite 15 miles North of the Grand Canyon North Rim on the night of Tuesday 8-16-11,I noticed a brightly colored object moving toward our campsite at the DeMotte US Forest Service Campground.  It stopped and I told my girlfriend to come look. We got the binoculars and saw red,blue,silvery white,and yellow lights spinning around in circles on the UFO.  We saw it very clearly.A few minutes later we saw 2 jets fly near the UFO as if they were checking it out also.  My girlfriend said to take a picture of it,so I got my camera and did.  She also took a picture of the UFO with her camera.  Then I decided to flash my large flashlight at the UFO.It stayed in the same place and moved only a few degrees horizontally to our right.  We observed the UFO for over an hour between the hours of 11:00pm and 12:00am.  We finally went to sleep in the van at midnight because it was just hanging there and we were cold and tired.We took pictures of the UFO with our Kodak cameras.  My camera is a Kodak Z981 digital and I took the picture at 26x zoom and my girlfriend took her picture with a Kodak C195 digital camera at 5x zoom.  We also noticed some orb looking objects in 2 of our pictures that night after I flashed my light at the UFO.Were not sure what they are.;35.9423;-112.1259
