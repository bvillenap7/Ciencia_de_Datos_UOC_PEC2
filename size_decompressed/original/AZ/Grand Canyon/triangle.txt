At the east rim of the Grand Canyon (Yavapai Point) 11:30pm looking north northeast about 40 degrees up from the horizon on a relatively clear night I noticed one light traveling in a southern direction. A few seconds later I noticed two more lights following directly behind the first. These three lights took the form of a slightly skewed triangle. All three lights were no brighter than an average star. The size was no larger when viewing a quarter held up at arms length. These white lights were moving slowly in a straight path for about 20 seconds and then it disappeared. I beleive the lights traveled behind a cloudy area in the sky but it never reappeared afterwards where the sky was clear again.;35.9423;-112.1259

My husband and I were driving on Route 66 in Arizona, heading east bound to The Grand Canyon on our honeymoon.  We were taking video pictures all day with our cam corder, so luckily it was on my lap when in the side view mirror I saw something that looked like an explosion in the sky behind us.  I asked my husband what it was and he looked and we pulled the car over and began taking video. What we got on film looked like a triangular bright light ascending into the sky.  It only appeared for a few seconds but it left a large zig zag trail of vapor, which as night fell expanded into a huge zig zag of rainbow light.  We kept taking video through out the enening, pulling over occasionally to get the zig zag rainbow on film. There was a large star near the occurance and the moon was visable.  There was no sound during the event.;35.9423;-112.1259
