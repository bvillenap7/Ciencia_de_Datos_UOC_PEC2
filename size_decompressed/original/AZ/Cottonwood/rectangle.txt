Two minutes later I took a video of the exact same scene of the rain storm.   Later, while reviewing them, I discovered an oblong, rectangular object on the street below in the photograph but it was not in the video taken two minutes later.   The object was approximately 75 feet long and 20 feet wide.   Although not clearly decipherable, perhaps due to the rain, it appears there is some form of lettering on top of the object.   I have saved both the photograph and video on my camera.;34.706;-112.0049
