Formation of 4 lights seen over Cottonwood.;2013-10-23 21:30:00;15-20 minutes;Formation of 4 lights seen over Cottonwood. Seen over Verde Village subdivision near Cottonwood.  There was a formation in the shape of an equilateral.  At each corners of the equilateral was a strobing light.  The formation flew across the night sky the same distance apart from horizon to horizon.  It flew over Mingus Mt. toward the Dewey/Prescott area. Shortly after the formation disappeared a plane at a seemingly higher altitude flew behind it.  The plane made it easy to compare that the formation was other than 4 planes.;34.706;-112.0049
