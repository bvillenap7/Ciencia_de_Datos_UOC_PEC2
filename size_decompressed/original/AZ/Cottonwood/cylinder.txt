As it rose higher that light became so bright it illuminated the whole valley. And it just hovered there and didn't move at all. All we seemed to be able to do was watch, suddenly the light dimmed and the disk suddenly shot off to the north and two other lights joined the ffirst and all three shot off and disappeared. After that episode my sisters and I spent many nights in our sleeping bags watching for ufos. These were not weather balloones as we were told by the military and police. We have seen to many unexplainable things to fall for that lie. This was just one of many encounters we've had. And I truly believe these vessels were not of this world, at this time we did not have the technology.;34.706;-112.0049
Witnessed object for about 15 seconds. Looked like a rocket launch;2000-04-18 19:00:00;15 Sec.;Witnessed object for about 15 seconds. Looked like a rocket launch I just witnessed what I believe to be a launch rocket launch. I live in central Arizona and just minutes ago at approximately 7:00P.M. Arizona time, I was outside looking west, watching an airplane flying west when I noticed a bright flash about 30 degrees above the horizon almost due west. The object had an elongated shape like a rocket and was pointing and moving upwards. It looked to be about one third the length of a straight pin held at arms length. I followed the object upwards for about 10 to 15 seconds to an angle of about 45 degrees. The object started to emit a vapor trail for about one second and then the whole thing disappeared from sight. I hope it was a launch from Vandenburg AFB. ((NUFORC Note:  A test launch was announced for this date, although the time indicated by the witness is apparoximately 1 hour later than the original launch window.   As indicated below, the launch was scheduled to take place up to 16:59 hrs. (Pacific Daylight Time):   APR 17   11:00-16:59  Minuteman III? ICBM test launch (non-orbital) Our thanks to Brian Webb for his Launch Alert data.));34.706;-112.0049
Silver cylinder observed in the middle of the day in Cottonwood, AZ;2012-06-08 11:00:00;less than a minute;Silver cylinder observed in the middle of the day in Cottonwood, AZ I was speaking to a co-worker near a window and an object in the sky happened to catch my attention.  The sky was perfectly clear and blue and in my view, north towards Sedona, I saw a very distinct, stationary glistening silver cylinder.  The cylinder was visible for less than a minute and disappeared instantly, without moving in the sky.;34.706;-112.0049
