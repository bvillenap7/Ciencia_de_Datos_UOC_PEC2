Triangle or three-light formation seen in daylight;2007-10-02 10:00:00;2 minutes;Triangle or three-light formation seen in daylight On the morning of 10/02/2007, about 10:00 AM, my niece and I were driving in the outskirts of Cottonwood, AZ.  I looked up though my front windshield, and noticed a triangle formation of three whitish/bright lights.  The formation or “craft” was moving smoothly in a “straight” path.  I called my niece’s attention to it, saying, “What is that?”.   As we watched (and I drove), the lights moved from right to left (east to west, I think) and suddenly disappeared. We heard no noise at all. It appeared to be about the size of dime or less at arm’s length, but it appeared to be very high in the sky, so it was probably very large if it was one craft lighted on three corners.  It was a bright, sunny day with very few clouds in the sky, and none in the area of the craft that it could have gone behind. The craft was visible to us approximately 2 to 3 minutes.;34.706;-112.0049
