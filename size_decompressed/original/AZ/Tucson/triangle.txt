Dark triangular object emitting dread, searching for something, then challenges USAF base security.;1972-11-08 20:00:00;10-15 min;Dark triangular object emitting dread, searching for something, then challenges USAF base security. the object came from the SE about 75 feet from our position, and about 35 feet above the ground, it had a triangle shape, no visible markings,, the object seemed to be extremely dark- flat black some what shimmery at the edges and at points on the surface of the object. There was a very deep drone hum, not really heard but felt, we didn't move as it seemed that if we made ourselves seen somethime may happen to us. As the craft passed in front to the NE and about30 yards from us a beam of brilliant whte light shot down to the ground from the (?) front of the craft, and began to sweep left to right down then up as if it were searching for something, When this light first hit the ground the was a disturbance of dust rising, and as it sweeped around you could see dust roiling up. We experienced an ill, nauseous, dread feeling. We continued to watch the object fade out of sight. The direction in which it was traveling would lead it towards a USAF TAC/MAC base. Soon afterward we felt eased of the dread and we about to leave when we noticed that the airbase had came alive, ie: search lights, sirens and military police vechiles ranging along the security fencewe saw this due to our being on a slight rise. We left in our car, and decided to check if the base was shut down, the main gate was closed and MPs were not allowing anyone to enter. The next day the word was that a coyote had set off the perimeter alarm. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

One extremely large, dark gray triangular shaped object with no lights or markings on it over Tucson, AZ. (1988);1988-07-01 13:00:00;10 minutes;One extremely large, dark gray triangular shaped object with no lights or markings on it over Tucson, AZ. (1988) While driving south on Craycroft from Broadway Blvd toward the Tucson airport, I noticed a triangular shaped object in the sky. It was so large I couldn't quite believe what I saw, but kept driving unsafely, until I was another mile south. I was at an intersection near Ajo Way when this object seemed just as large as before. I stopped in the right lane of that intersection and a woman in a vehicle to my left seemed to see the object in the sky also, and we made eye contact. We both stopped and I pulled over to the shoulder. The object was a gigantic triangular shaped form. It was very dark gray in color with no lights or printing/insignias on it. This was a very brilliant day, with no clouds, so this object was clearly visible, and it was not a mirage or a cloud. I stayed parked at the roadside fore at least 3 minutes watching this object hover motionless over the Tucson International Airport and the Davis/Monthan Air Force Base area. It did hover motionless for that time, because I became very hot and thirsty, and also stunned at this sight. I can't recall anyone else stopping to view it, except that one woman I made eye contact with. She was gone. The large gray object dipped its wing, so I could see a dimension of how large it really was. It was like a city block long. Very suddenly, it disappearred. I was thinking I had a dream or a day-dream, but I know certainly I didn't. I was very sobor and I don't do any drugs, so I was very afraid to tell anyone about this. I told one person, but he said that I saw a new US secret bomber. Nope. This object had a very definite triangular shape, made no sound, stood still in the sky for too long and would certainly have made great news, if reported to the authorities.

I saw a very large, dark gray triangular shaped object in daylight, which was not identifiable.;1988-07-01 21:30:00;3 minutes (?);I saw a very large, dark gray triangular shaped object in daylight, which was not identifiable. This sighting of a strange aircraft was witnessed by myself and one other unidentifiable person. It was a very brilliant sunny day. The giant aircraft was seen floating over the Davis-Monthan AFB, but maybe to the west, near the Tucson Airport. It was very large. My guess is that it was about 2 city blocks long. It was dark gray or black. There were no markings on it (and no lights , since it was daylight). It hovered for a few minutes, very silently, and tipped it's wing slightly, so I saw the dimension of its size.It suddenly disappearred, as if it was never there.  It was not a civilian aircraft, or any USAF jet, since I'm familiar with all those due to living in the area. This craft was gigantic. this is no hoax, and I only report it now due to much embarrassment when I tried to tell others about it many years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

He was in a playful mood and I began to throw small stones which he would chase.  As I was walking over to pick up a few small stones in the corner of walled in yard, I happen to grance up into the very clear, cloudless sky and noticed a darken object very low to the ground.  At first I could not determine if the craft was moving.  At this point it was quite some distance away, approx 1 to 1 1/2 miles.  I continued to watch the craft and it began to get larger.  I knew the craft was obviously coming in my direction.  I kept wondering why the aircraft had not turned on its landing lights be cause the U.S. Air Force Base (Davis-Monthan AFB) was only a few miles south of my home.  The base is almost directly south of my home the the Tucson International Airport is just on the other side (slightly southwest).  I immediately called the craft to!my daughters attention who had just come out to tell me one of my favorate programs had just come on.  We both stood there watching as the craft got closer.  When it was approximately 3/4 mile from us,  it's true shape became visible.  It was a triangle shaped craft, moving very slowly at approximately five to eight miles per hour.  It was approximately 75 to 100 feet above the ground.  It had no lights on the front of the craft at all.  I told my daughter that it was going to pass almost directly over us.  When it got to only a few hundred feet away, we began to see lights on the bottom of it.  There were four lights that were in a straight line down the middle of it that ran the full lenght.  The lights were spaced about 20 feet apart.  As it passed slightly infront and above us, we could see very clearly that the craft was metalic in color and did not have a smooth surface but appeared to have a plated surface.  I could see what appeared to be lines of rivits that connecte!d them togather.  The craft did not make a single sound, and after spending 18 years on active duty in the Air Force, I knew it was not something that was man made.  It I were going to guess at its weight based on its size as mentioned above---I would say approxmiately 80 to 110 tons.  As I passed by my daughter was the first to notice two stobes on the rear corners that were blinking very fast (much faster than normal aircraft), both were white lights and could only be seen from behind.  Even when the craft was at its closest point from us, could not be seen until the rear of the craft began to become visable.  It was at this pont that I could even more clearly see the previously mentioned plating affect.  I was able to at this point based on the visible edges of the triangle in my own mind determine the thickness of the craft .  The back of the craft had three very large lights , two approximately 10 feet in diamenter and the third much larger light between them.  It was abo!ut 15 feet in diamenter.  It may sound strange but the lights were not giving off a really bright light but definately light that appeared to be defused.  The lights on the bottom of the craft appeared defused as well.  The craft was close enough that a man with a good strong throwing arm could have easily hit it.  I know that this story sounds like something out of a science fiction book, but I swear it's the truth.  I will be more than willing to take any lie-detector test you want.  Feel free to contact me concerning this sighting.  I almost forgot--the following day after the close encounter, while in the restroom of my home preparing to shower or something i remember finding a blister about the size of a dime just above my left ankle.  There was no pain, and I only noticed it as I was taking of my sock.  I pressed slightly on it and rolled my index finger around.  It poped and I expected to feel pain but there was none.  I pealed away the lose skin and noticed that the ti!ssue that should have appeared red or pink was brown.  Normally, blisters dont leave scars in a perfect circle--this one did.  The only reason I have taken this time to tell you about what we seen, is that I can't stop thinking about it.  I hope if have really reached someone who will take the time necessary to confirm my sighting anyway they have to.  Now I know for sure--They do exist and I don't care who says they don't.  That includes our goverment.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
25 miles west of Tucson, Az.  Strange orange balls in a triangle pattern, in march of 1997.;1997-03-17 21:00:00;10 seconds;25 miles west of Tucson, Az.  Strange orange balls in a triangle pattern, in march of 1997. I didn’t realize it at the time of course, but this sighting was on the same night as the famous Phoenix lights in 1997.  I heard the mention of them on Coast to Coast AM on Saturday and it got me re-excited.  I live aprox 30 miles west of Tucson Az, between Tucson and the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range.  I do not live close enough to the range to ever see flares or ordinance dropped, however.  Between 19:30 and 21:00 I was driving a friend of mine home on my ATV, when he spotted 9 orange balls in the sky in a triangle pattern.  When my friend hit me on the shoulder and made me look six of them had gone out and I only saw 3 orange balls in a triangle pattern.  They way they went out was strange.  It seemed like they turned, or maybe like a larger black circle had covered them, almost like an eclipse over them. I stared at them for aprox. 5 seconds and then 2 of them went out at the same time, then the last one about 1 second later.  The Impression I got was that they were about 10 miles away, and very large.  When I returned home, 2 of my neighbors called me over and told me they had seen weird lights in the sky out towards Kitt Peak (which is a observatory in the same direction I saw my lights).  Because they were towards the Barry Goldwater Range, I dismissed them as flares, even though they appeared to be well outside the boundaries of the range. What else could they be? I thought.  A few weeks later I heard about the Phoenix lights from my neighbor who also saw my lights, and told me she wondered if the ones we had seen and the Phoenix lights were related.  Since this sighting, I spent 4 years in the Marine Corps, and became familiar with aerial and ground fired flares and I have never seen anything that looked like this.  When I heard On Coast to Coast AM that there were sightings west of Tucson on that night as well, I wanted to report mine, even though it is late.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

This was a roughly triangular shaped craft with two whitish blue brilliant lights which lit up the craft making it's shape visible.  The craft seemed to be huge because it was above the clouds and the size of it was amazingly big compared to if there was a 747 at that height.  It had a sound of that which if you took a very large electromagnet and applied a considerable amount of current to it(a sort of a deep humming sound with a pulse in it).  We saw that the craft just seemed to be passing by going north then changed direction to northwest.  The sky was clear with some clouds and some stars.  The color of the craft seemed to be a metallic bluish black surface.  Again, the lights were very bright and brilliant, alot brighter than any aircraft I've seen.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

They were appeared to be about the size of an eraser.  There were two on top and one on the bottom forming a triangle.  The moon was low in the sky and directly in front of me and the lights were a little lower than the moon.  They did not flicker and they did not move.  I had to turn north to get to my house and I looked over my shoulder as I turned and saw them.  It takes about 30 Sec. to get to my house.  I parked the car and jumped out and looked and they were completely gone.  I ran into the backyard and stood on the picnic table and searched the whole sky and they were gone and there was no moving lights in the sky. The lights were very bright and pure white.  There were no other colors and they did not flicker.  They were all the same size and appeared about the size of a pencil eraser.  There were two next to each other, horizontally, with a small black space inbetween.  There was one below that was positioned inbetween the top two, forming a triangle.  I was traveling east and watched them for about 20 minutes.  When sitting at a red light, I could determine that the three lights were stationary in the sky.  The moon was very low in the sky that night and directly ahead of me.  The lights were to the right of the moon (southeast) and just a little lower that the moon.  I had to turn north to go to my home and as I turned, I looked over my shoulder and could still see the lights.  I later timed it and it takes 30 seconds after I turn to get to my home.  When I arrived home, I jumped out of my car and looked for the lights and they were gone.  I immediately went into my home and to the backyard and stood on the picnic table and searched the sky.  The lights were gone and there were no moving lights in the sky, only stars.  I watched for quite a while because I live by Davis Monthan Air Force Base and I wanted to see if they deployed any planes, but they did not.  The base is about 3 miles from where I live. Last fall my daughter and some of her friends saw a UFO over Rincon Mountain and within minutes the air force base was deploying pairs of planes. I have a master's degree and am a 49 year old female.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Dark unlit object streaking across Tucson sky at unbelievable speed.;1999-10-05 21:15:00;< 5 seconds;Dark unlit object streaking across Tucson sky at unbelievable speed. A few minutes ago, approximately 2115 MST,  while sitting in my hot tub behind my home on the East Side of Tucson, AZ I saw a large dark object traverse the sky from South to North at unbelievable speed.  There were no lights, only a silhouette against the moonlit sky.  The object appeared in the Southern sky and was out of sight to the North in less than five seconds.  I am a retired Air Force Officer and I live to the East of Tucson International Airport and Davis Monthan Air Force Base and see countless aircraft crossing my property, but I have never seen a totally dark object, or have I seen any object pass that quickly.

Sighting of large flying triangle north of Tucson AZ;1999-11-17 23:30:00;1 minute;Sighting of large flying triangle north of Tucson AZ On the night of 11/17 I was in Tucson on business. I looked for a spot to watch the meteor shower. I drove up a dark road north of Tucson, in the mountains looking down into the valley. Approx twelve other people were present, including a few students from Univ of Arizona. Sometime after 11 I heard someone say (not shout) what is that?. I looked to the east and saw three huge bright lights heading in our direction. As the craft banked, it was clear that it was a solid, triangle-shaped object. As throughout the night you could occasionally see planes flying towards Tucson Int'l Airport, it was easy to get an approximation of the size. It was at least twice the size of a large commercial airline, and probably three times the size. Without a doubt, it is the largest aircraft I have ever seen. As the craft passed by, it made NO SOUND. This was not a trick of the wind as you could hear other planes all night long. Approx five minutes after the craft passed, three military planes passed overhead in loose formation, heading in the general direction (east to west) of the first craft. Five minutes after that, three more jets passed over in a tight formation moving fast and in the exact direction of the original craft. Several people had to plug their ears when the second group of three passed. I am an executive level individual, which I only tell you to hopefully help validate what this report states. If I were asked, I would think that what I saw was a large military transport of some sort. I know the size is accurate since there was plenty to which to make comparisons. It was the only aircraft to emit no noise that night. It made a graceful arc in front of our location, so the shape was easy to see. I would judge the speed as similar to a jumbo jet while landing (ie it seems they are going slower than they really are). I had a hard time finding this report format, so this is a bit dated. If someone would like additional info, it is ok to call or e-mail me. Anyone who states these craft do not exist does not know what he or she is talking about. I am not saying it was aliens or anything like that, but the craft is there. Thank you.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

With binoculars, it's a lot clearer.  They change colors, red - white - and blue.  Often they are triangular in shape.  Often they emit beams and one night I saw little crafts going off of what appeared to be the mother craft.  They are generally in the same area.  There is an AF base in Tucson, i.e., Davis-Monthan.

Until we seen it get closer we noticed it made no noise my dad still thought it was a helicopter but i knew there was no way.  It got so close to the ground I actually thought it was gonna crash but as soon as it close to the floor it shined 3 lights on the desert floor I noticed it was a triangle shaped object.  My dad and I were shocked that we didn't want to wake my mom up because she was sleeping.  It was odd because it was silent and it moved in a way which reminded me of a glider... Ive many things on the internet regarding a tr-3b so I.  Know it is real also that craft had a little blinking light like our own government planes so I think it's not alien but it is scary to know we have this technology.

Bright triangle shaped lights over Tucson skies;2006-11-08 04:50:00;5-10 minutes;Bright triangle shaped lights over Tucson skies At 4:50 in the morning on November 8th, my boyfriend - age 20 and myself - age 18 were outside on his back patio while he smoked a cigarette. His house is located on the far north east side of Tucson, off of Catalina highway and it is surrounded by moutains. It was over these moutains that I saw an extremely bright light off in the distance that appeared to be rising at an angle in the sky. At first, I assumed it was a police helicopter shining its spot light in our direction but it was moving at an abnormally fast pace and the light never seemed to shine in any other direction. Planes, as well as helicopters, fly over my boyfriend's house quite frequently and they both have a very distinct sound. The object I witnessed made no noise what so ever. At this point, I called my boyfriend over to look at it and as we both stood watching it, the object appeared to freeze where it was and simply hover in place. The two of us got the feeling that it was watching us and ran inside of the house to wake up my boyfriend's mother. We were inside of the house for twenty seconds at the most before returning outside.  In the short period of time that we were inside of the house, the object had made it's way all of the way over to the other side of the sky and was now gliding slowly towards the city. It was flying incredibly low and from what I could make out, it appeared to be triangle shaped with a bright red light that protruded slightly from the center with three smaller, but incredibly bright white lights at each rounded point. My boyfriend's mother, who was a skeptic, described it as looking like a ferris wheel turned on it's side with the red light representing the axis. The three of us watched it in the distance and as we did, it appeared to go straight up in the air, then down at an angle and hover for a moment, then go straight up again and repeat the zig-zag pattern until we lost sight of it.  Another unusual event had occured a few months prior at the location where I first spotted the object in the sky which I feel is worth mentioning. My boyfriend had been out smoking on the patio around four in the morning in early July when we noticed what appeared to be a vapor trail that was surrounded by different, glowing colors (namely red, purple and green) in the north east area of the sky. It hung in the air for atleast an hour with all other colors but red fading away slowly. The red glow and vapor trail remained until sun rise. Over the following few days after we had witnessed the trail, people were saying that it was a result of missle testing however I have yet to see any images of missle testing that compare to what I saw that night.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

The shape went from side to side and then the formation changed to a sideways v. It looked like > and then went the other direction and looked like <. There were 2 cars who pulled off the road to look and take phone camera pictures.  I saw it for approx. 15 minutes until River Road turned into Alvernon Way.

Dark, triangular-shaped object traveling slowly to the south-east.;2008-11-03 19:10:00;40 seconds;Dark, triangular-shaped object traveling slowly to the south-east. I live in Pima County, AZ about half way between the northerly limit of the city of Tucson and Oro Valley to my north-west.  I am near the base of the south-westerly end of the Santa Catalina Mountains.  My ZIP is 85704, and my altitude is 2500 feet above sea level. This (Monday) evening I was sitting on my second-floor balcony enjoying the evening air and observing the night sky to my north-east.  I was not using binoculars or a telescope.  The sky in my view was cloudless and I could clearly observe Capella rising in my direct field of view.  I was wearing my distance nighttime-diving glasses to aid my view of the night sky however, my un-aided distance vision is excellent. At 1910 hours I observed a dark object transit my field of view, traveling generally from a north-northwesterly direction to a south-southeasterly direction at a steady speed and course.  The angle above the horizon was about 35 degrees and the object passed well above Capella.  At first I thought it was a flight of geese in a tight ‘V’ formation of symmetrical shape.  However, the shape simply was too uniform and steady to be a flight of birds unlike the shape of a flight of geese which changes in shape over even a short period of time.  I thought that I could see individual dark objects, perhaps 9 or 10 of them, forming the ‘V’ (a ‘V’ similar to boomerang-shape but broader at the center than the traditional boomerang shape). I observed this object for approximately 40 seconds - I have an additional view to the east and south-east which I can observe through a separate opening in my balcony.  So, I was able to observe the object as it passed through an arc of about 90-100 degrees. There was no sound and no light from the object.  I have no clue as to the object’s altitude.  However, my guess is that if the object was flying at 1,000 feet above the ground, its speed was about 120 miles per hour perhaps a bit more. I’m submitting this report simply to confirm and reinforce any other reports you may have received concerning this object.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Saw what appeared to be stars shooting laser lights down, also an object emitting other objects in to another;2009-11-30 21:00:00;:20 min;Saw what appeared to be stars shooting laser lights down, also an object emitting other objects in to another I have seen the same things in the sky for over a year.  One night my dog  was extremely anxious and began to bark angrily and excessively at the back door. I was reluctant to get up and let her out as she had just been out. I had gotten off work late and was eating dinner at the table, my dog was going crazy (like when someone knocks on the door) I finally got up and took her out, she ran out with the hair on her back standing up. When I got outside to take a look around I looked and saw what I thought was the police chopper, It was a large light hovering pretty low. I went back inside to finish my dinner, however my dog continued to be very upset, so I went back outside to physically carry her back inside. When I went outside I stopped and watched what I originally thought was a police chopper, and as I watched I realized it was something else. The light seemed to grow in size and it shot a smaller star out and that star shot out and we watched it glide across the sky, ! it shot north and we watched it until we could no longer see it. It also appeared to have what looked like a streak of grey afterburner smoke under it. Naturally I called everyone I knew to tell them about what I had seen, my brother suggested that I keep my cell phone on me and try to get a picture of it, if it happened again. I decided that was a good idea. I never thought I would see anything like that again, however the next day I had my phone in my pocket, and my dog began to bark excitedly again. I ran outside and looked up and around for a while, then right above me  I spotted a red laser looking thing shooting out of what I thought was a star. At first I thought it was my imagination, but I put my cell phone on video and held my arm up for about half an hour and suddenly I actually saw it again and got it video taped on my cell phone. After that point in the days to come my dog continued to bark excitedly and sure enough when I go outside if I look up in the general direction where she is barking, I almost always get a shot of a star shooting a laser usually white sometimes blue and red only twice.  It  has been a! year and I probably have around 60 videos of these things. I can only surmise that they make a sound that we cannot hear but that my dog can hear. Aside from the stars that  shoot lasers, we also have videos of what looks like 5-6 stars and suddenly one star like light comes out of the bottom of one star and slowly goes up in to another. I keep referring to  the word star because if you do not know what you are looking for they just look like stars. It's my dog that hears or senses something that alerts me to something strange up there. Often times there are three stars in the shape of a triangle out there and the two bottom stars of the triangle shoot lasers. I  have been hesitant to report anything because I don't want to be classified as a crazy person, however I need to report to someone, I know what I have seen and what I have on video. I live in a town where there is a military base, and I sometimes wonder if they are experimenting with something, but I am tired of seeing things, I am tired of my dog getting so upset and I just want to know what these things are. Can you help?;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Triangle aircraft with 3 lights above tucson;2010-11-26 02:00:00;10 minutes;Triangle aircraft with 3 lights above tucson Last night I was smoking a cigarette outside and saw a bright light in the sky traveling at very high speeds across the sky.  It was going from one side to the other.  I went inside to get my binoculars and when I came out it was still there.  Through the binoculars I saw a triangular shaped aircraft with 3 lights, one on each point.   I live on the mid-NW side of tucson and my balcony faces the south.  The aircraft seemed to be southwest by A mountain.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
2 pulsating orb like lights hovering, ascending straight up, then across and saw its triangular shape and lights;2011-09-04 21:02:00;5 minutes;2 pulsating orb like lights hovering, ascending straight up, then across and saw its triangular shape and lights I am just emailing to report what I witnessed this evening. I am an attorney, and the very last person that would make up something like this. I was sitting outside this evening with my mother and my sister (Northwest Oro Valley), and we all witnessed what was not a plane, nor helicopter, and the only way I can think to describe it would be to say a UFO. It was hovering above the mountains, not even moving, then it went straight up into the sky (not horizontally as plane would fly, straight up), at a slow hovering pace, we noticed it first as two pulsing lights, it is really hard to explain.  Then it moved over the sky, right above us, and it was DEFINITELY not a plane.  I really do not know how to describe it, I have never seen anything like it.  It was triangular shaped and had a line of lights (I would say about 5), but they were not regular lights.  I really don't know how to describe it. Then it was just gone. Frankly, I am still in a state of shock and awe at this point.  I had my phone with me at the time, and at first we were just so shocked at what we were seeing.  Then I thought of my phone being in my hand, so I turned on the camcorder of my phone, and you can definitely see it.  It is not as clear as what we saw, because it is a video from a phone, but it definitely shows the hovering lights. I don't know why I am even writing this.  I guess because in case other people call in that perhaps report that they saw it, I just wanted to say don't discard them as not being credible. We saw it too.   I would never in a million years make up something like this.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Bright, orange, triangular light north of Tucson moving towards the south then turning east and disappearing;2012-11-07 21:30:00;30-45 seconds;Bright, orange, triangular light north of Tucson moving towards the south then turning east and disappearing A bright, orange, triangular light appeared in the NNE ski from NW Tucson (Marana), approximately 30 deg above the horizon.  It was moving at a fast airplane speed towards the south.  Thought it was a meteorite at first, but moved too slow for that.  We watched it for about 20 seconds as it moved almost directly towards us then it suddenly turned toward the east and quickly faded away and disappeared.

Tucson sighting from Catalina Foothills: 4 lights, triangle formation, moving low and silent in a northwest direction in the Tucson sky;2014-03-04 19:39:00;5 minutes;Tucson sighting from Catalina Foothills:  4 lights, triangle formation, moving low and silent in a northwest direction in the Tucson sky Our Tucson apartment is on Sunrise Drive between Swan and Craycroft.  Sunrise is a main road that runs east to west along the base of the Catalina Mountains and Swan (to the west of our apt) and Craycroft (to the east) are roads that run perpendicular north and south.  Tues night (3/4/14) at 7:39pm, my son was sitting on our third-floor, south-facing apt balcony.  From the balcony, which faces Sunrise, we have a panoramic view that includes city lights to the southwest, Davis-Montham/TIA lights to the south, and Tucson Mountains to west.   At around 7:39, my son noticed what appeared to be a large triangle-shaped craft with 3 point lights (spaced evenly apart in a straight line) along the back and a single light at what would be the point of the triangle or front of craft.  This large, expansive-looking craft was moving slowly and silently at an angle over Swan heading northwest in the direction of I-10.   He immediately called me as he was watching it and I happened to be driving north on Craycroft towards Sunrise with a friend following two cars back.  All the way up Craycroft to the light at Sunrise (about 1 mile), I was unable to see anything and thought he was exaggerating.   However, as I turned left to go west on Sunrise, there it was up ahead directly in front of me up in the sky.  My view of it was of the back three lights only as it moved away from my direction, heading west over Sunrise.  I did not see the front point light.   A Pima County Sheriff's Supervisor SUV had been directly behind me at the Craycroft/Sunrise light and as soon he turned the corner behind me, he gave one blast of the siren, stomped on the gas, cutting around me and the car to the left, racing up Sunrise in that direction.   I reached home in about three minutes and it had already disappeared from my view.  My friend, who had been behind the Sheriif, had seen it as well as soon as we turned on Sunrise.  My son, however, said he watched all four lights seemingly disappear and ran to the other side of the building but it was not visible after that from any direction.   Nothing on the news or anywhere today about this.  We've seen odd lights in the sky before from the balcony but never anything like this.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Saw a fast moving arrowhead shaped object, glowing from bottom, appear and disappear, moving horizontally.;2014-10-05 23:49:00;2 seconds;Saw a fast moving arrowhead shaped object, glowing from bottom, appear and disappear, moving horizontally. I saw an arrowhead shaped object moving horizontally through the clouds in the northeastern sky, mid horizon level, in Tucson, Arizona on 11:49AM on Sunday October 5th.  It seemed fairly close, and also appeared to be large.  It was moving at a fast speed and was silent. It appeared out of nowhere, glowed brightly in a flickering way (but with a substantial bottom illuminated), moved quickly, and then disappeared.  The glowing didn't appear to be propelling the object, it just moved quickly.  The object was darker toward the top. At first I thought it may have been a spotlight going through the clouds, but it was clearly an object with depth and dimension. I see a lot of planes around Tucson, living on the flight path to TIA, but no plane I know could do what this object did without making a sound.  And this object simply was not shaped like any plane I've seen.  It had an almost primitive shape, but behaved in an extraordinary way. There also appeared to be parallel lines wrought through the clouds near where the object was sighted, but this may have been just a cloud formation.  I did not see the object make these streaks.  And there was no trail left directly behind where I actually saw the object.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Unidentifiable craft moving at extreme speed over Tucson, AZ SEPT 6, 16;2016-09-06 14:45:00;1.5 minutes;Unidentifiable craft moving at extreme speed over Tucson, AZ SEPT 6, 16 I witnessed a triangular shaped craft flying slightly west of Tucson AZ. This craft appeared above a large military jet, the size of a C-130 transport. The smaller triangular shaped craft didn't attract my attention until I noticed the speed and flight pattern it was flying, and then grabbed my eye. The speed at which this craft traveled gave my a wierd feeling, like I was watching a cartoon. It followed a corkscrew pattern with a few slight deviations. It also appeared like it was making a flight pattern similar to a radical roller coaster with the upward corkscrew at tremendous speed, ending with a vertical burst of speed through the clouds leaving my field of vision. Was this a newer fighter jet like the F22.? This event left a lasting impression on me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Huge, Brilliant White Light (Triangular) Craft seen in Tucson, AZ;2019-12-10 18:20:00;3 min.;Huge, Brilliant White Light (Triangular) Craft seen in Tucson, AZ On December 10th, 2019, in Tucson, AZ, saw extremely big, brilliant white light traveling across the early night sky  from NW to SE (from Tucson Mnts. towards full moon).  Light was also visible with the naked eye.  Through our Night Vision Goggles it looked like a possible huge triangular shaped craft that was illuminated in a halo-glow but the glow was brighter in the front of it.  Additionally, it seemed to be traveling on a Low Earth Orbit (LEO).  Cannot believe that no one else reported this, since it was also visible by the naked eye.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
