SLOW-MOVING FIREBALL REPORTED SEEN IN TUCSON, ARIZONA IN BROAD DAYLIGHT;1986-06-20 17:30:00;3 minutes;SLOW-MOVING FIREBALL REPORTED SEEN IN TUCSON, ARIZONA IN BROAD DAYLIGHT While standing in an open doorway at the rear of the building that I worked in, I was smoking a cigarette. I was alone. I was facing North, when from the West, I heard a roaring sound...as the sound one would hear listening to a powerful furnace, roaring flame sound. Suddenly, passing over the building west of us, came a very slow-moving giant ball of flame. It seemed to be almost hovering, it was moving so slow. Estimation: 1-2 mph. My mouth dropped open as I watched this object move West to East in front of my eyes...I estimated it to be moving approximately 15-20 feet above the ground..it was almost perfectly round...I could see a dark round mass within the violent flames encircling it..It left a trail of flame,with a few sparks flickering on the tail of the flame. The diameter I guessed to have been about 15 feet (when I was looking at I quickly made a mental note that one could have easily placed a full-sized automobile within it). It passed in front of me approximately by about 20 feet. I watched it move easterly across the fence next to our property, and until it was out of my sight! Approximately 1/2 hour afterwards, I heard on a radio broadcast that it had been seen and reported to that radio station, by 100's of people! The broadcaster stated that this radio station had called our local air force base, Davis Monthan, and inquired if they'd heard of this reported phenomena. Supposed response from the Air Force was: It was an experiment they were working..... Yeah, right!! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

It was not only odd because of the color but was descending slowly and not in a sharp dive at all. After passing below visibility because of some trees in the area, a blue green flash was seen. It is hard to estimate ho far away the object was, but at the very least it was quite a few miles away from the observer. ((NUFORC Note:  8:30 p.m. is 2030 hrs., not 1930 hrs.

Extremely fast, huge, bright fireball.;2004-05-28 20:10:00;2 seconds;Extremely fast, huge, bright fireball. My wife and I were sitting in the front room watching TV. Both of us were taken back by what we saw out the front window.  We have waited a week, called the Arizona Daily Star, and no one has contacted us.  It was a 'fireball' that was in site no more that 1-2 seconds. What was unusual was the size...possible 2-5 times larger that what we thought would have been a plane, and 100 times larger than the thousands of metors we have seen in our life.  It was dark, and hard to judge distance, but I would think it covered 10-20 miles in those 1-2 seconds.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Large, glowing, floating, red fireball/orb spotted in the sky for a very short time before it disappeared.;2008-03-15 19:00:00;2 seconds;Large, glowing, floating, red fireball/orb spotted in the sky for a very short time before it disappeared. I was playing basketball in my backyard and out of the corner of my eye I noticed something in the sky. I turned and saw a large, bright, red, glowing object that looked like a fireball or an orb. It was a few miles away and made no sound and it was slowly floating downwards for a second before it just disappeared. I told my family and no one believed me. After a few minutes of them telling me that they didn't believe me, I started to question whether I had actually seen it because it was for such a short amount of time. The next morning I turned on the local radio and they were saying that people reported seeing UFOs in Mexico the day before. I am sure that it wasn't a meteorite or anything of that nature.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Burning Embers Sighted in Sky Near Tucson;2008-06-09 20:00:00;>10 min;Burning Embers Sighted in Sky Near Tucson I was sitting on my front porch facing South on Monday June 9, around 8:00PM, gazing out to the West at the remnants of the sunset against the Tucson mountains. An orange light in the sky appeared against the red-orange-green of the fading daylight. The light was relatively stationary over the West part of the city (about 20 miles away from me) at about 3,000 ft in the air. And so I assumed that it was an airliner on it's landing approach to Tucson International. A few things about the light, however, caught my interest. It appeared to be too orange to be an aircraft landing light and it seemed to be positioned too far to the North of TIA's runways 11L/11R to be on the final approach leg to one of those runways (the lines of descending lights on Tucson's Western horizon at night are airliners landing on these runways). After about 2 minutes a smaller orange light broke away from the original light and after a few seconds the two lights casually faded out . The manner in which this happened made me think of a small plane on fire and a part breaking away from it before falling out of the sky, yet I heard no explosions or saw no burning embers fall to earth. Still, the novelty of this event inspired me to wait around a while to see if I could hear any police sirens or breaking news reports about a small plane crash over Tucson. As I was doing this I kept my eyes on the Western sky to see if anything else appeared. After about 15-20 minutes I became bored and went into the house to get something. About 5 minutes later I returned to the porch and resumed my scanning of the Western sky. The sky was now a bluish-green horizon turning to the blackness of night as I spied another similar orange light to the South of the original one, this one farther away and appearing to be at a much higher altitude . This light only appeared for half a second before falling fast like a tear drop and disappearing. I stayed outside for about 30 minutes after that and did not see any other similar events. When I finally went inside, it was night. I wonder if anyone else in the city saw this?  A few things to think about: Davis-Monthan Air Force Base is situated in between my house and the airport. I am a former pilot and have never seen this type of thing before. It could have been a flare drop at the Barry-Goldwater range in the desert to the West of the city, yet it seemed too close for this it appeared to be in front of the Tucson mountains from my frame of reference. It could have been space phenomena, i.e. meteorite activity, yet all of the meteroite entries into the atmosphere I have seen have been very fast an angular.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

At approximately 7:20 pm PST (same as Arizona time), before sundown I saw a large bluish object roughly the size of a 1/8 object held on an outstretched arm.  It appeared similar to a tracer bullet from WW2 war footage.  It moved across the sky directly overhead and terminated to the north.  It sort of hung in the air for approximately 3-4 seconds.  As it approached the Catalina Mountains to the north the object burst into an orange flame for the last ½ second of flight before disappearing behind the mountains.  This occurred in Tucson, AZ while I was driving due east and looking approx. or within a few degrees of due north.  Object appeared to be falling from the sky, but may have been traveling across the sky.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Object in sky with ball of fire dangling from it, dripping sparklets of fire;2010-10-22 05:45:00;2 minutes;Object in sky with ball of fire dangling from it, dripping sparklets of fire I saw what I initially thought was a plane with a ball of fire dangling from it, with droplets of fire falling (like a candle). It was traveling East to Northwest. I could see a long object above the dangling fireball, it 5 orange and red lights, three in a row behind it, two lights to the left and right of the fireball. It was moving forward in the beginning and then started swaying slightly north and south (almost wobbling) as it traveled. It stopped and hovered with the fireball still lit and what still looked like drips of fire. By this time I had gotten my neighbor up who also saw the object.  As it hovered the fireball went out, but I could still see one orange light from the object. It started moving again, slowly, then it I lost site of it.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Eventually they disappeared back into the sky. There were many people pulled off the side of the road, including police officers watching the lights. My mom and I saw it together and then met up with my friend at the same time who also saw it and him and his family were staring into the sky when we pulled into his driveway. None of us recorded it because we felt compelled not to. I started to grab my phone and then just stopped. They were low in the sky, burnt orange and made no sound. It was never on the news. I was scared for my life at the time.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

3;2013-12-04 19:00:00;3 minutes;On 12/04/13 at 19:00 I entered the parking lot of Sabino Canyon which is located on the edge of NE Tucson.  While getting things out of my car trunk for a night walk up the canyon, I looked to the SE over the very eastern edge of SE Tucson and saw a bright orange light about 3 times the size of Venus in the night sky.  The light was  self contained, laser precision and didn't have the star burst glare of plane headlights.  Even though it was self contained and was not emitting a flame in any way, it had the characteristics of being somewhat on fire. This light proceeded towards me from about 10 miles away and then turned and went up into the cloud layer above the nearby Rincon Mtns.  The event lasted about 45 seconds. Just a few seconds later another identical light appeared from behind a nearby hill again to the SE of me but farther west than the first object.  It seemed to be coming up right out of the city itself since it started so low.  Again it travelled somewhat towards me and then went up gradually in the clouds above the Rincons. By this time I had my binoculars out and noted that it had no running lights or any other colored lights around it.  This one took about one minute from start to finish of the sighting. Then yet another one appeared even farther to the west but this time was seen IN FRONT OF a very small hill just 2 to 3 miles away.  It then proceeded for 1 minute to climb up into the cloud layers above the Rincons traveling for one minute or less. There was no wind other than a mile zephyr breeze of 1 to 2 miles an hour.  All of these objects travelled several miles of sky in less than a minute each thus ruling out Chinese lanterns.  Also, it rules out that they came from Davis Monthan AFB since the last light was seen starting its course in front of the hill just a couple miles from me and also the AFB is located farther west from where the first 2 came from. There was no sound emitted from any of these objects.  I saw the last object VERY clearly through my binoculars and it had no running lights as noted with the 2nd one as well.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Looked like a bright orange fire flying across the sky of Tucson.;2013-12-27 19:00:00;2 minutes;Looked like a bright orange fire flying across the sky of Tucson My friend and I pulled up to my brothers house to pick  him and his friend up and I pointed out what looked to be a odd bright orange light, almost like a fireball!  My brother asked is that a plane on fire? Just because it was so incredibly orange like a plane fully engulfed in fire, but it just kept flying across the city sky till we could not see it anymore.  Speed looked about the same speed as a airplane or a fast helicopter but there was absolutely no sound to it.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Fluorescent green fireball seen from Catalina over the Santa Catalina Mountains.;2014-04-12 20:00:00;3 seconds;Fluorescent green fireball seen from Catalina over the Santa Catalina Mountains. I walked out my front door (which faces east toward the Santa Catalina Mountains) about 8 pm to let my dog relieve himself.  There are no street lights in this area so it was quite dark.  As I was facing east, there was a brilliant fluorescent green fireball that streaked in a downward arch toward the north.  I just saw it for a couple seconds before it went behind a neighbors large tree.  There are mountains that line most of my east view and it arched below the level of the mountain ridge.  I didn't see any sign of the fireball after it passed behind the tree.  It appeared to be some distance away (about 3 miles), but was quite large compared to the usual air traffic lights I've seen in this area (all manner of private, commercial, and military planes and helicopters).  As it was only green, it did not resemble any aircraft light I have previously seen, both in configuration, size, or hue.  As I have been around military aircraft my whole life and am a pri! vate pilot I am quite familiar with the color and formation of running lights and this was in no way one I have ever seen before.  It is pretty quiet here as there are no major roads or traffic around here, especially at this time of night, so it was quite easy to observe that there was no associated sound with this.  Shortly after seeing this I saw and heard a couple firetrucks speeding in that direction although I don't know if that is where they ultimately were headed, especially since there are no roads that I know of that would have taken them to the area I saw the light.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

The object then headed North East, shrunk down to the size of a star or  a plane light, moved in straight line, then disappeared.  I live near the base, but there was no aircraft noise. I tried to take a photo once I pulled into my driveway.  It does not appear but does show a streak of a light tinged red.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Large falling UFO disappears into flash of blue light over Tucson.;2017-11-14 22:30:00;10 seconds;Large falling UFO disappears into flash of blue light over Tucson. At the Thornydale and Orange Grove intersection, a friend and I had met up for dinner plans and were saying our goodbyes, when all of a sudden, we both saw a massive blue light streaking down and blinking.  It appeared to be about the size of an average helicopter, and was blinking fairly rapidly as it fell to the East.  After about 10 seconds of watching it “fall,” the object disappeared in a flash of blue light that remained for a second or two more to illuminate the sky above. My friend and I both sat in stunned silence for a few moments before regaling each other on what we saw, and both of our accounts matched perfectly.  There was no other activity going on at the time.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Four orange fireballs traveling together , fly over the house;2018-02-09 19:25:00;30 seconds;Four orange fireballs traveling together , fly over the house Three orange fireballs appeared out of thin air coming straight at us, out of the south, one after another they turned and headed due east!  Was able to observe these with Celestron 15x70 Skymaster binoculars.  Objects were observed at a 45 degree angle and what I would estimate a thousand feet.  These objects then turned, following each other, heading due east over towards the Rincon mountains.   Once they had gone from sight, a fourth orange fireball appeared going what seemed to be twice as fast to catch up with the other ones.  These all appeared brilliant orange, with the binoculars it was amazing!   After talking to all involved with the incident, we agreed that they were the size of a basketball.  They were so close and with the binoculars you could see the center was a brighter orange than the outer ring which flowed backward behind the objects as they moved.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
