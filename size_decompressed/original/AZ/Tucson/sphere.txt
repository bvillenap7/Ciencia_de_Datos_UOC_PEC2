giant ball of fire seen over tucson hour after dark around 1989;1989-10-16 08:00:00;2-3 seconds;giant ball of fire seen over tucson hour after dark around 1989 I don't know the day or month. it was about an hour into the first movie, which would be about an hour after dark. me & two friends were at the Apache drive in theatre , facing the west screen looking west. as we were watching the movie all of a sudden the entire area lite up almost like daylite but not that bright. I assumed that a jet from the airport was making a turn and it's headlights was shinning on us, so I didn't  turn to look at it , because i didn't want to be blinded by it's light. after a couple of seconds & the light didn't go away I turned to see why, just as I did  it came in view. it looked like a giant round sphere of fire. It was approxamatly 1000 to 2000 feet in elivation, one half mile south of us, it only took 2 seconds to travel from our local to the top of the south end of the tucson mountains, which it just bearly cleared. It was at least as big or bigger than the U of A football stadium , which seats 50,000 people. it was totaly silent & there was no sonic boom or exhaust trail. being only about an hour after dark in the tucson area, there must have been at least 100,000 people outside , not facing north who couldn't possibly have not seen it.  for the next two days I monitered the tv news, radio news & newspaper looking for reports, but saw none whatsoever. I researched ball lighting & found it couldn't be that. nothing in science explained what it could have been .   a year or two later the same phenomenon was reported over southern california, heading from southwest to the northeast toword  area 51. the one i saw was heading basically east to west slightly southeast to northwest.  a couple of years later I was watching a taped video lecture of a young german scientist giving a lecture about WWII Nazi UFO technology & in it he spoke about a perticular sphereicle  craft  that would give the apperance of a giant ball of fire. that was the only thing i have ever heard that sounds like an explanation for what  me & my friends saw. . thank you.

Orb at Red Roof Inn, Tucson, AZ;2002-04-13 10:00:00;3-5 minutes;Orb at Red Roof Inn, Tucson, AZ On April 13, 2002 we were staying at the Red Roof Inn near I-10 and West Ina Rd in Tucson, AZ. We were there for my brother’s funeral. I am unsure of the exact time but it happened just a few hours before the funeral which was scheduled for 2pm so I estimate that it was around 10am but it could have been 10:30am. My mother may remember what time it happened. My husband and I had a room on third floor on the north side of the building and my mother, grandmother and a friend had a room on third floor on the south side of the building. We were over in my mother's and grandmother's room visiting when my mother said she needed to get something out of her rental car and wanted me to go out with her because she wanted to tell me something. The car she rented was parked in the parking lot on the north side of the building right near the entrance. In the late morning this side is in the shadow of the hotel. The lobby had entrances on both sides of the building. So we took the elevator down and then my mother told me what she wanted to tell me. Then she proceeded to look in the car for something. She didn’t find it in the trunk so she opened the front passenger side door and was leaning into the car looking through a bag of stuff. I stood next to the car with my back to the building looking north. As I stood there, motion to my right caught my attention and I turned to look and saw what looked like a bubble, like the bubbles kids blow from a soap solution. It was traveling from the direction of the freeway towards the back of the building. It came down the aisle the way a car would have except that it was floating about 6 ft above the ground. As it got closer I realized it wasn’t a kids bubble but then I remembered that rubbery kind that the kids blow through a tube but as it got closer yet then I knew it wasn’t that either. It just glided along and then just as it passed the back of my mother’s rental car and up to the sidewalk leading into the hotel, it suddenly turned to the left like it was go! ing towa rds the entrance to the hotel but then it turned again and headed right for me but just as it got near me it also increased in altitude a few inches. So I was just standing there trying to figure out what it was and I finally said to my mother, “Look at this” and she backed away from the car and stood up and looked and she didn’t see it approach us and so her perception was off and she thought it was larger but further away and said, “Oh, a kids balloon” and I said, “No, it’s closer” and she said, “Yeah, you’re right” and then she started talking up a storm about what it might be. We both sensed an intelligence about it and felt as though it were looking at us. As we stood there staring at it I sort of heard in my head the name of my brother. It was like the orb communicated telepathically. The hair stood up on the back of my neck at that point because it scared me but I then discounted it and thought, ‘how could this be my brother and what would would an orb have to do with my brother.’ Then I remembered something my husband had watched just a couple weeks or so before about spirit orbs near battle grounds. The orb was about the size of a softball or slightly larger and it was pearly white with a little discoloration on the bottom just to the left (from my viewing perspective). After hovering there for a while then it reversed the original flight path until it got to the back of the car and then it floated along the drivers side of the car back towards the hotel and then went up and over the top of the hotel. We lost sight of it after that and so my mother hurried up and shut the car door and we raced through the lobby of the hotel to go out the other door on the south side to see if we could see it again. We did see it again. It seemed to light up or catch the sunlight differently sometimes because sometimes we could see it very well as though it were a light and other times we couldn’t. Then finally we couldn’t see it anymore. It was heading sort of southwest towards some mountains off in the distance! while g aining quite a bit of altitude. When we couldn’t see it anymore we headed back upstairs and as we stepped off the elevator on third floor, my husband was standing there. He didn’t know what was taking me and my mother so long and was about to come down and look for us to find out. So we told him what we had seen and right away he said that it was my brother. I don’t know what I saw except that it showed intelligence and watched us and knew the name of my brother. I want to know what that was and why it happened just before my brother's funeral and how it knew we would be there and how it knew my brother's name. It is creepy when anyone knows stuff about you when they shouldn't.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Silver balls in the sky AZ;2004-03-01 14:00:00;5 min;Silver balls in the sky AZ I was outside tanning on my grass and it was a nice clear day except for a cluster of clouds in the bright blue Arizona sky. I had a towel over my face because I had lost my sunglasses but took it off because my face was getting too hot.   I looked up in the sky because I saw some clouds and I hoped they wouldn’t block the sun while I was tanning. I first thought I was seeing eye fluid bubbles, “I don’t know their correct name”, and so I rubbed my eyes and lay starring up at the clouds again not expecting to see anything. Watching the clouds move, I let my eyes relax in a gaze. What I saw were two very little or just really high in the sky, ball shaped, silver objects moving and stopping in and around the clouds. I watched as they moved and stopped and fallowed each other in the sky. After a while one vanished and the other vanished soon after.  I told my sister when she got home but she just said, “Oh”, but that to be expected I guess. So nothing super really happen that day but I got to see two UFO’s and that was really cool. I do live in Tucson by DM Air force Base, and see planes in the sky all the time these were not planes and weather balloons don’t move like that.

Bright Sphere Falls Towards Horizon, then Moves Horizontally across Tucson Night Sky,  May 16th, 2004;2004-05-16 21:30:00;5 seconds;Bright Sphere Falls Towards Horizon, then Moves Horizontally across Tucson Night Sky,  May 16th, 2004 My partner and I were relaxing on our deck in Tucson, Arizona at around 9:30 or so on Sunday evening May 16, 2004.  We are accustomed to seeing falling stars and other night-time sky activity (i.e. planes, military aircraft, etc.), especially since we have a deck that has 100% unobstructed sky views.   Suddenly, we became aware of a bright, round sphere which appeared to fall very rapidly towards the earth and we thought it was just the hugest, roundest, brightest falling star we had ever seen...perhaps even some type of meteor.  But then, as the light came closer to the horizon it moved sideways - truly one of the oddest sights either of us have ever seen.  Did anyone else see it - or can anyone else out there collaborate this story?  We didn't BOTH just imagine it.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
A daylight sighting of a white sphere near a chemtrail over Tucson, AZ was observed from schoolyard by parents and teachers.;2007-03-09 12:05:00;10 min;A daylight sighting of a white sphere near a chemtrail over Tucson, AZ was observed from schoolyard by parents and teachers. While picking up my son from school near the intersection of 6th Ave. and Speedway Blvd. I looked up at the chemtrails from the school steps leading from the playground to the building.  I had been pointing them out to my mother throughout the day.  My mother was with me, visiting from out of town.  I noticed a white sphere next to a chemtrail and became very excited because I am involved in the UFO phenomenon and I hadn’t had a sighting in a while, much less with so many potential witnesses, especially Mom.  So I announced to the teachers and parents on the schoolyard that I was seeing a UFO and they all saw it as well.  There was one other parent, a male, who later told me he had had a major sighting in Oregon before.  Two other teachers saw it and another parent.  I don’t remember if my mom could see it.  She doesn’t have great vision.  It was five minutes after noon.  The UFO was very high, about 75 degrees in the sky.  I was looking north and the object was just west of the Santa Catalina Mountains.  It was initially between two chemtrails, but then got lost in the one on the left.  It reappeared again.  Eventually it was clearly seen again below the chemtrail.  I now wonder if the object was stationary and the chemtrail was drifting.  I wish I had sited the object relative to a non-moving object like a telephone pole.  I took a picture of  it with my mom’s disposable camera, but I haven’t developed the picture yet and I doubt it will show up as it was very small and high up.  The two parents and I moved out into the parking lot and continued to observe the object for another five minutes, perhaps.  I used my cell phone to call George Parks of MUFON (I’m a member) to tell him about it.  He didn’t see it as I had trouble telling him where to look relative to his location.  After I hung up with him the parents and I drove off in our separate cars.  The whole event lasted maybe under ten minutes.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Spinning Chrome/Red disk;2007-04-14 15:20:00;7 minutes;Spinning Chrome/Red disk Object was seen from backyard on North West side of Tucson at approximately 15:20 PM on Saturday, 4/14/07.  Looking due north, object appeared to be metallic, shiny, then brushed chrome, approximately the size of a half dime held at arms length.  It did not move in the sky (very windy day) after about 30 seconds it took on a red hew, only to then again become chrome in color.  This pulsing color pattern repeated throughout the entire sighting.   The object seemed to be spinning in the sky. It did catch the sun on the west side as it spun, always being brighter on that side.  After about 6 to 7 minutes, it simply disappeared in the sky.  Two people in the yard witnessed the sighting.   We did try to take a few pictures, only one came out were the object could be seen.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
One spherical silver object was sighted for 15 seconds in the central Tucson skies below a plane with contrails heading East .;2008-12-03 08:31:00;30 seconds;One spherical silver object was sighted for 15 seconds in the central Tucson skies below a plane with contrails heading East . I was making my daily trek to my job from Picture Rocks to downtown Tucson (19 miles one way) along Silverbell (a road that parallels the freeway).  I saw one spherical shiny silver or white looking object in the sky heading East about one inch from object a plane with a contrail, this plane was heading East far above the object.  I looked away for about 45 seconds, and then looked back and it was gone.  It looked like it was above central Tucson -  I was longside the public golf course on Silverbell. I looked for this object for about 4 minutes and kept searching for a plane or the morning balloons (people hire them for rides in the mornings-because our winds are less here in the mornings, and less planes to contend with because we have an airport).;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

I witnessed three spherical light green orbs in a large triangle formation moving very slowly towards the Northern mountains in Tucson, AZ.  The lights flew Northwards for about 15 minutes before shooting straight up.  Once they had ascended they started to fade out and eventually disappeared. I am a college student from Scottsdale and I was in Tucson with my mother when we saw the objects. Neither of us have seen any sort of UFO activity before, but we are certain that these objects were not weather balloons, planes, or any other sort of man-made aircraft.   After the objects disappeared I noticed myself feeling slightly lightheaded and my eyes felt sore and dry for about 10 minutes, before returning to normal.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Streaked in like a meteor only to slow down and break into 5-6 orbs, stop, hover 3 sec, dance up and down in the sky;2013-03-14 20:30:00;2 minutes;Streaked in like a meteor only to slow down and break into 5-6 orbs, stop, hover 3 sec, dance up and down in the sky I was sitting on my couch facing my picture window when a huge fireball came streaking thru the night sky.   I jumped up off the couch telling my husband “it’s a huge meteor” and ran for the front door never taking my eyes off of what I was seeing.   Even before I got to the front door 2 thoughts in secession went thru my mind.  The first was that this meteor was big and definitely gonna impact with a boom but then as I got closer to my picture window, which is right next to my front door, I had a second thought that this meteor did not look quite right.  What had appeared to be the fire tail just did not look like fire at all.   My husband had jumped up and grabbed his cell phone and was right behind me as I opened the front door.  As we stepped out onto the front porch this fire ball slowed down and slowly split into 5 or 6 very bright amber orbs and came to a complete stop hovering between my house and the Tucson Mt. range which is about 3 miles away.  I cannot tell you how long I would perceive this string of orbs to be except to say it was huge and would easily be seen in the night sky.   It hovered for about 3 seconds then turned itself horizontal and slowly sank behind one of the peaks of the Tucson Mt. ridge line.  It then came back up from behind the ridge still in a horizontal line but in a diagonal trajectory.  Slowly sank behind the ridge again and then came back up once more in a diagonal trajectory but only revealing 3 of it orbs this time.  It sank back down behind the ridge again and came up one last time only revealing part of 1 orb.  While we were watching this display take place my husband called his friend who lives on the other side of the Tucson Mt ridge (in town), he ran out to his back yard but did not see any lights dancing up and down in the sky.  I found that to be quite perplexing.  My husband was speaking with his friend while the orbs were still displaying themselves.   The next morning as I was leav! ing for work I noticed a smaller ridge between my house and th! e Tucson Mts. that I never really paid any attention to before and thought to myself that maybe these orbs were not actually dancing up and down behind the Tucson Mts but might possibly have been between this smaller ridge and the Tucson Mts.  A few days later I checked the internet to see if any one had posted any sightings and could not find any thing mentioned.  I am confident that had this happened where town could see it people would have been coming out of the wood work.  These orbs were huge and bright and seemed to be having some sort of fun time dancing up and down in the sky that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It shot straight up in the sky within the valley, stopped around the top of the mountain range for a moment, slowing descended, stopped half way down, slowly descended again and began to swirl slowly around the top of some houses then I lost sight. Twice it did this routine within about 10 minutes, I can tell the way it moved it was definitely a ufo.  I actually called the resort and there wasn't any fireworks last night she said, told her what I saw and can tell she didn't believe are care about it.

Eight large, slow moving, noiseless orange-red spheres traveling over Tucson evening sky.;2016-02-04 19:30:00;20 minutes;Eight large, slow moving, noiseless orange-red spheres traveling over Tucson evening sky. About 7:30 pm, I was taking groceries from my car into my home, when I looked south into the sky and saw two large (as compared to commercial jet or helicopter) red-orange colored spheres.  They were moving across the sky, west to east, but very slowly.  I could see no lights, typical to any aircraft flying at night, and I strained to hear any kind of aircraft noise and could not.  I watched them travel east and then sort of disappear or fizzle out. I continued with my groceries and then noticed two more of the same.  A few minutes later, two more and then two more came more quickly.  All had the same characteristics and moved slowly, almost as if floating across the sky. Just before the final four spheres crossed, another small aircraft came into the space from a more northwest direction.  However, the path of this plane took it right next to these spheres, so it had to have seen them as it passed two of them. The final four spheres also traveled slowly to the east before fizzling out. I thought maybe our Air Force base was doing some new kind of craft experiment or they were weather balloons.  The only different thing was that at the end, I believe I could see tiny lights around the spheres, very tiny, almost like diamonds or little stars, but they were moving, too. I emailed neighbors to see if anyone else saw what I did and one couple replied that they did. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Very bright spherical UFO over Tucson.;2020-06-25 04:30:00;25 seconds;Very bright spherical UFO over Tucson I was having a restless night, so was awake early. I was staring at the ceiling when the object entered my field of view, through the window above our bed.  It was as bright as a star and clearly spherical.  It was moving at a steady velocity from SW to NE.  When I noticed the object I immediately put on my glasses for a better look and watched it until it went out of sight.  I jumped out of bed, headed for the back door to my patio, grabbed my Nikon binoculars on the way out.  I regained visual contact with the object again as it proceeded NE and got the binoculars on it again.  It definitely was not a conventional aircraft, neither rotary or fixed wing.  There were no additional lights of any kind or color, only the bright illumination of the sphere.  I am accustomed to seeing satellites in the night sky, in different orbits, at different velocities, and this was no satellite either.  The satellites are small specks, and this object was many times larger in terms of visual angle subtended.  It moved smoothly, and I listened for any sounds of an engine...it was silent.  It did not maneuver, jink or turn . It did not change speed. I watched it through my binoculars until it disappeared.  I was a USAF pilot ('72-'85) with global flying experience and also spend time at night stargazing and observing the city with binoculars.  I don't know what this object was, but I know what it was not. It was nothing conventional.  I live in the foothills of the Tucson mountains, in a dark skies area, and have a very good view of the sky and our surroundings, especially the east.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Pulsing white light Spherical object;2020-09-27 02:50:00;15 minutes;Pulsing white light Spherical object On 09/27/2020 at 0250 hours,  I was in my backyard looking East. I observed a spherical object of white pulsing light. From my compass app I determined that object was bouncing from 80 degrees East to 92 degrees. The object would dim and brighten, at it’s brightest it would jump to a spot covering up to 5 degrees per jump. It took about 15 to 20 seconds to complete this cycle from dimming to jump to the next coordinate. The movement started to the lower left bouncing up about 5 degrees and to the right also about 5 degrees. The compete cycle from the lower left position to the top right position, then reversed until the object roughly returned to the starting position. No sounds were heard from this object. The object blinked out at 0305 hours. My location was 37•17’49”N 110•51’51”W at Place of observation. The object was due East of my position at about 40• above the horizon. There were no ground lights visible between my position and the object. It was a t! ypically Dark Tucson night. The strangest part of the sighting is the object was almost over the Mount Lemmon Observatory! There are several observatories in that general area. Please contact me with any questions you may have.
