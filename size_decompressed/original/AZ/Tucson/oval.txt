I was standing looking at the stars ;1998-10-14 22:00:00;2 min.;At approx. 10:00 Pm, we were sitting on the porch off an upstairs bedroom facing the eastern sky.  I was standing looking at the stars when I saw what I thought were twin shooting starts far in the eastern sky.  But the stars stopped their decent and then came heading toward us in a slow manner.  As they continued heading west...I was amazed.  I told my husband that he had to come and see this. They seem to float through the sky...oval in shape or like two flat bowls glued together...they were a glowing orange, almost seemed translucent.  No sound was heard and they continue into the west.  I moved to the front of the porch so I could watch them further.  They headed into the the western sky and mountains. As we were enjoying the evening at a local bed and breakfast on the corner of 1st street and 5th avenue in Tucson, I was standing watching the stars.  I observed what I though were two shooting stars in the eastern sky.  I thought that was quite strange to have two shooting stars, following the same decent.  Before they reached the horizon they came toward the west. As they came closer...I told my husband the come here...he needed to see this.  We watched as they continued on toward the west.  There were two oval (like two flat bowls glued together) and flying side by side with slight movement from side to side.  They seemd to be glowing orange from the inside. There were no lights to be seen on them. Since we observed lots of airplanes from the Tucson Airport and the Air Force base and helicopters during our stay...we can say objectively they were not commercial aircraft.  It is hard to judge the distance and heighth they were, but they didn't seem to be extremely distant.  They continued into the the western sky and into the mountains. My husband and I were visiting our daughter in Tucson and we reside in Malaysia.  We are American citizens.  My husband is ex-navy and I am an artist.  I am 49 and my husband is 52.  I have always been interested in the UFO phenomenom, but have never observed one.  And my husband is a skeptic.  His comment was  I don't know what they were, but I have never seen anything like it before.  The next day I was relating the story to our daughter.  Her comment was  Mom, we see them all the time in the night skies here.  We don't pay any attention anymore because it is so common! I didn't know there was a national reporting center until I did some research on the net.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Bright glowing lights flying in the clouds in Tucson;2002-11-06 05:50:00;10 SECONDS OR LESS;Bright glowing lights flying in the clouds in Tucson I saw two large bright glowing lights flying either in the clouds or just above the clouds.  Kind of off white color, maybe slightly yellowish.  Shape of both lights was mostly circular, but slightly oval.  They flew in an absolutely straight line, very fast for their size, no sound, and maintained an exact distance from each other.  I couldn't tell if it was two aircraft or one aircraft with two lights, but in either case, it had to be absolutely HUGE.  Each light was about the size of a dime if I put my arm out straight and held a dime in my fingers.  They came from the south and were heading in a north or slightly northwest direction.  Took less than 10 seconds for them to streak across the sky and out of sight. The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6.  I remember the time exactly because I was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at Davis-Monthan AFB waiting for my shift to start.  I was participating in an exercise and normally wasn't there that early.  When I saw the lights go by, I froze, didn't want to blink or even breath.  The lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway.  I had been in the Air Force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and I NEVER saw anything like this.  After the lights went by, I looked around the parking lot to see if anyone else saw it, but no one was around.  That in itself was odd.  There should have been several people in the parking lot by that time. When lunchtime came, I went back to my unit to report it to the SOC desk.  I asked them to call the tower or base ops to see if they saw it or got any similar reports.  The guy at the SOC desk just laughed and made a joke of it, like ha ha, Sgt E saw a UFO, what were you drinking, what were you smoking, can I have some of that too?  I kind of expected that since he was an assclown so I let him joke around for a minute and then I asked him, ok can we get serious now?  Just call the tower and ask them if they saw it.  Next he just ignored me so I pressed him a little harder.  Then one of the ADOs came out of his office and told me to just drop it, asked me if I have somewhere I need to be and told me to get going. I've never seen anything like it since but if I ever do, I'll certainly never report it through Air Force channels since no one wants to hear about it anyway.  There's simply no one who takes such reports.  Report it through your chain of command and they won't give a crap.  Report it to any other Air Force agency and it will never make it past the nearest shredder or trash can.  The that's not my job philosophy definitely applies here. Since I just found this site and a couple others like it, I figured I'd check to see if anyone else ever saw what I saw, but I don't see any that match this particular sighting.  So for what it's worth, here's my one and only sighting.  If I see any more, I'll let you know.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Whitish Grey somewhat Egg/Oval in shaped slowly hovering way up in sky, folding in half/quarter and back to Oval/Egg again.;2003-05-20 02:35:00;30 minutes;Whitish Grey somewhat Egg/Oval in shaped slowly hovering way up in sky, folding in half/quarter and back to Oval/Egg again. While lying on a float in the pool, I was gazing into the blue sky. Then I saw a whitish grey oval/egg shaped disk, which appeared to be folding in half at times. It was far away and moved slowly around and about and to the east over the top of Mount Lemon. My 5 year old son saw it too, and said he saw it spinning and also folding and unfolding.  I took pictures and in the picture, their is more than one of these, with this the bigger one and a bunch of (maybe 4/5 other smaller ones). The picture turned out grey (a darker grey caller as if they were all shadows). Yet another picture turned out white dots. The object moved away just a tad bit faster, when Davis Monthan Air Force Base Jets flew over. Then I could no longer see it. The Jets were flying over previously in the day. Makes you wonder WHY?

Sceptic observation of 3 fighter jet sized oblong, black and silver light flashing crafts.;2007-02-06 13:30:00;45min-1hr;Sceptic observation of 3 fighter jet sized oblong, black and silver light flashing crafts. I was sitting in my back yard on the east side of Tucson having a break from yard work and visiting with a friend. We apparently live in a flight path as we often have jets from Davis Monthan AFB flying over and often helicopters at a lower level. As we were talking, I noticed what my mind assumed were jets practicing for an upcoming air show in the sky behind my friend. I had this initial thought because the maneuvers of the 3 jets seemed very much like what we see when the pilots practice. As I was talking my eyes kept going back until I had to interrupt the conversation. I suddenly realized they were not only very oddly shaped, (oblong and black) but they were very close and there was zero sound. We got up and went to the edge of the yard as they were coming closer. My friend said they look like sky divers as they were apparently connecting then releasing in a triangular and straight pattern. It looked as if 2 would connect and let go then all three would do the same. This went on for a few more minutes and we both commented on things like weather balloons of some sort or perhaps some kind of weather anomaly. We were both trying to figure out the explanation. They began flashing what would be best described as, a silver light. Not in a specific pattern (not that we recognized) but random and they would stay lit when they connected into the straight pattern. It became more and more obvious that we had no idea what we were looking at. When they connected and lit, it seemed as if they melted into a single craft. Then a jet passed over the area above them. This reinforced the lack of sound as we could hear this jet quite well and it was farther than the unidentified crafts. They then began to rise into the sky as we watched the display of aerodynamics and the light show. My friend called her daughter in-law who was in the neighborhood. She told her to go outside and my friend tried to help her locate them over the phone. I ran in the house and took a 12 x 12 mirror off the wall. We h! ad alrea dy decided that a photo at this point would be useless. When they were at their closest, we were still trying to rationalize and now they would just be too far away.  I went back out and tried reflecting light towards the ground at first to see if I could get the same reflection off the mirror in proportion to where I was situated on the ground. (They were NNW of my home when we first spotted them) After realizing I could not reflect in this direction I began trying to flash the mirror, in theirs. Perhaps I was looking for some kind of a response. My friend went to meet the daughter in-law as she was terribly excited and wanted my friend to point out what we were seeing. She was not able to find them again to show her daughter in-law, after she left my house. I watched them a total of about 30 to 40min more until they had gone so high, they were just a periodic spec of light, and then they were gone. I am no aviation expert but I have never, ever seen a plane or any other piloted craft go so high up. I keep trying to make sense of what we saw. If I had been alone, I would not have told anyone what I had seen and I would have been sure to stay out of the sun for the remainder of the day. I am considered by others and myself to be a skeptical person, so I welcome any logic that could explain all of this.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Pure white oval object seen at the Catalina Mountain Range, Tucson, Az. 01/06/12;2012-01-06 09:10:00;10 secs;Pure white oval object seen at the Catalina Mountain Range, Tucson, Az. 01/06/12 On the morning of 01/06/12 at 8:30 my friend and I were hiking east of Tucson at the end of Broadway Blvd. in the Saguaro Nat'l Park.  I am 61 and work in retail sales and he is in his 50's and is a professional therapist.  Due north of us is the Catalina Mtn. Range.  I estimated the range to be approx. 5 miles away and upon looking at a map that distance is confirmed. At approx. 9:10 AM I looked to the north towards the Catalinas and saw a pure white object below the skyline thus framed against the mountain itself.  It appeared to be the size of a small plane or good sized helicopter at first notice and was traveling due east skirting the mountain range at a speed that would not be inconsistent with such vehicles.  Since I wasn't paying attention to sound in the environment due to my friend and I having a conversation I then stopped hiking, called the attention of my friend to the object and then listened for engine or rotor sounds. I initially heard motor sounds but we soon both agreed that it was coming from northwest of us and was clearly machinery being used in roadwork or something similar.  I then watched the pure white semi-round object begin to have a ripple effect similar to a bed sheet fluttering in a breeze.  This effect was contained in the confines of the object itself and was not a phenomenon that the object was projecting in any way. It then proceeded to travel on its unwavering horizontal course and became pure white again.  it should be noted that my optometrist told me that with my glasses on (which I was wearing) I have better than 20/20 vision.  My friend told me he has 20/15.  He said he didn't see the initial couple of seconds of the incident due to a cactus being in the way but we both saw the next phase where the object either appeared to be glinting light or creating light.  At this point the object itself could not be seen other than a complete ball of light similar to when a silver plane catches the sunlight and reflects with a strong glow or glare except in this case it was evenly distributed and all encompassing. At this point my friend got a call on his cell phone and he looked down to press the keys to answer the call and that was the end of him seeing the object.  What I saw at that moment was this ball of light that then subsided back into being a pure white object that then made a arced turn towards the north at the same altitude and disappeared heading north and within a second or two was obscured by some mountain peaks. This object was close to being round but seemed more to be slightly elongated from the front to back rather than top to bottom.  There were no noticeable wings or other structures or markings visible on the object and definitely no helicopter propellers.  If I were to guess the size in relation to stars even though it was daytime I would say it was 4 times the size of Venus.  The entire event for me was approx. 10 seconds.  For my friend it was about 5 seconds.  From the beginning to the end of the event it travelled approx.  20 degrees of a 360 degree radius of the sky. Initially due to the height of the peak it was framed against it was below the skyline and framed against the mountainside that was behind it.  Due to the contours of the mountain even though it was traveling on the horizontal, in a couple of seconds it was then seen with the sky as its backdrop.  What really struck me at first was the fact that this object was below the skyline which made it impossible for it to be no more than a few miles away and thus I automatically assumed it had to be a helicopter since many of them pass through that area.  Again, no sound and sound travels far in the desert and definitely no propellers or wings seen on the object.  When I saw it turn north it's speed and movement was not at all consistent with a helicopter since the turn and speed were too fast for a helicopter or even small plane.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
