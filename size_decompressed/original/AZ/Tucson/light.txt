Lights and beems over AZ desert;1986-07-20 01:00:00;15mins;Lights and beems over AZ desert As we were traveling south on Interstate 10 towards Tucson at approximately 1am, there was no one else on the interstate, naturally.  I happened to glance out my side window, thinking I had just seen a flash of lightning off in the distance.  But what I saw was far less mundane.  About 300 yds off the hiway was a light hovering about 300ft above the ground.  The odd thing about the light was its erratic behavior.  It seemed to be darting all over the place.  It would move, stop, and shoot a pinpoint beem of bright white light to the ground, that illuminated the ground like daylight.  Having just been to the Grand Canyon that day I had my camera in the truck with me.  So I reached for the camera, and having just been to the Grand Canyon, I had used all my film earlier that day, naturally.  My wife, her sister and myself watched this fo about 15 mins before it shot off and we went on to My sister-in-laws house in Tucson. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

We saw unidentified lights that didn't blink or make noise and moved very, very quickly.;1997-03-13 22:00:00;10 minutes;We saw unidentified lights that didn't blink or make noise and moved very, very quickly. It was late at night as my friends and I were driving home from a school event.  We lived in North Tucson and my friend's house was in a pretty undeveloped area, so it was very dark out.  I was riding in the front passenger seat when I looked out the window and saw bizarre lights in the sky, toward the north.  I pointed this out to my friends and we pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road to watch.  It was a formation of 4 bright white lights, they were in a crescent shape and they didn't blink or move.  We had no clue what we were seeing as we got out of the vehicle to look further, the formation suddenly changed shape in one very fluid motion to where the lights were in a very large triangular shape, the fourth of the lights down next to the bottom right corner of the triangle.  The lights were still white, we didn't hear any sounds and they didn't blink.  After a few moments the formation shape changed once again, the lights moved into a straight line and CHANGED COLOR from white to red.  They then started moving in a line very quickly in a south-west direction (I think), before suddenly all disappearing at once.  We were pretty scared at this point, we jumped back in the car and peeled out toward home!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Erratic movement not found in conventional aircraft;1997-08-20 19:30:00;+/- 1min;Erratic movement not found in conventional aircraft Upon getting out of the car, I looked eastward toward the mountains directly east of Tucson. Some distance away, yet on the city side of the mountains, I witnessed a single white light ascending at an almost vertical angle. Upon reaching an altitude approximate to that of most private (Cessna type) aircraft, it flashed once as though reorienting and took off at an extremely high rate of speed at an approximately 40 degree angle toward orbit. It then winked out and disappeared.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

3 green/blue, non flashing lights hung in the N/W Tucson sky, the space between the objects varrying as they hovered.;1998-07-25 22:00:00;15 minutes;3 green/blue, non flashing lights hung in the N/W Tucson sky, the space between the objects varrying as they hovered. I was near the intersection of Columbus and 5th street in Tucson, the night of July 25th, about 1000 pm when I noticed the three lights hanging low to the horizon in the N/W sky. It struck me as particularly unusual because their brightness and color belied the usual stars or planets that might be seen there. Their position was so low, the city's glare mkes it all but impossible that they could have been stars. And besides, their positions were drifting. >From my vantage point, they appeared to be at least 10-15 miles away from me, but certainly it could have been much further than that. I was too far away to see a whole lot more than what I told you, but I certainly would be happy to confirm any other possible, more close up viewings of what was seen. These were NOT flares. From my vantage point, one of the lights was clearly moving upwards, and often times appeared to draw very close to the most upper of the three lights. Also, the lights did not blink and they're movements were not the movements of any conventional aircraft. i.e. helicoptor or plane. I wish I had been closer, and I'll be interested to see what the papers say I was looking at in the morning. I was returning home from work when I saw the lights, so I have no idea how long they may have been there before I saw them, or where they may have been. I only know I first picked them up at about 9:50, and lost sight of them at about 10:10. From where I was, they appeared to be drifting off further to the N/W, and I lost them below the tree line at that point.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

They seemed to be incredibly high up, but even at night when things are pretty quiet I heard nothing as I would expect from a plane or planes flying over. The lights-which had no tails-simply flew from north to south. It was practically over as I realized I was seeing something visibly odd.When asked of the size of the group, I said it was about double the size of a full moon-the whole group.Their speed was unimaginably fast and their light was constant-no brightening or diminishing.They appeared separate but moved as one.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Witnessed an extremely fast-moving object, moving across the lower sky toward the horizon in a Northwesterly direction. Object emitted ;2000-03-19 21:00:00;5 seconds;Witnessed an extremely fast-moving object, moving across the lower sky toward the horizon in a Northwesterly direction. Object emitted a flashing white light. I was star gazing from my balcony in NW Tucson, looking westward toward the night sky at around 9 PM, when I saw an object moving at an extremely high rate of speed toward the western horizon. I am an aviation buff, and I have never seen any man-made aircraft move across the sky this fast. I would estimate it covered at least 30 or 40 miles in those few seconds. The duration of it's appearance was approx 4 or 5 seconds, and it appeared at though it was heading at a 30 degree angle toward the ground. It was impossible to tell how far away it was, but it moved NW toward the mountains and disappeared over the horizon. I watched for a flash from an explosion, but never saw one. I assume it was moving toward the NW and simply was following the earth's curvature. I'd be curious if anyone in the Phoenix or Las Vegas areas witnessed it as well. It was impossible to see what shape it was all you could see is a brightly blinking white light. I have watched many satellites and jet aircraft cross the skies at night here in the desert, but I have NEVER seen something moving this fast. There was no sonic boom, or noise of any kind from the object.  Also, at the same time, I saw the lights of an approaching jet airliner from roughly the same direction.  The jet was inbound from the NW, heading for Tucson Intl, and it took about 10-15 minutes for it to come close enough to my viewpoint to identify it as an aircraft. I wonder if the crew on that aircraft saw this object, which was heading roughly toward it's path? The weather was clear, with a bright, full moon. I was not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Stationary white star-like light took off at high speed and disappeared when we looked, strange flash above, ground shaking.;2002-08-06 22:30:00;5 minutes;Stationary white star-like light took off at high speed and disappeared when we looked, strange flash above, ground shaking. Camping up on a butte in the desert east of the Ricon Mts. NE of Tucson, ~4,500 feet, GPS coordinates 32.10 by 110.29. First, a helocopter buzzed the area without any lights. It shined it's searchlight onto the desert about a mile away from us for a second or two. Then my friend called my attention to a flashing white light over Driscoll Mt., GPS coordinates 32.11 by 110.27. When I looked to see it, it wasn't flashing, it was a steady white light, looked like a bright star. Then a second later, it took off to the right (south) at about 300 MPH (with no sound or acceleration time), and then disappeared behind the bottom of a cloud. If it would have continued on it's course, it would have popped out from teh other side of the cloud in a couple of seconds. Then the storm that was approaching us started to lightning. I looked up at the sky telling my friend that we're on a butte in the desert, so it's best to call it a night and hide in the tents. Just then when I was looking straight up, a huge flash went off right above me. There were no clouds above me. It looked like a big camera flash going off. No lightning bolt nor any thunder. I got scared and hid in the back of my truck where I sleep with a loaded .44 Magnum next to me. My friend reported the mountain seemed to shake like an earthquake - no such thing in Arizona. That's all. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from same source for locations in Arizona and Colorado.  PD));32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Two large bright glowing lights flying in the clouds in Tucson.;2002-11-06 05:50:00;10 seconds or less;Two large bright glowing lights flying in the clouds in Tucson. This is an addendum to the report already filed for the same date, time, and location.  I rewrote paragraph 2 only, so you can replace the second paragraph with this one.  The rest is the same.  Thanks.  The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6. I remember the time exactly because I was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at Davis-Monthan AFB waiting for my shift to start. I was participating in an exercise and normally wasn't there that early. It was still fairly dark outside but daylight was just starting to break.  As I was looking forward through the windshield, I first saw the lights out of the corner of my eye out the driver side window.  Even before I turned to look at them, I could instantly tell these were odd lights in the sky.  As I watched the lights go by, I froze, didn't want to blink or even breath, and I had this real ominous feeling like I was in the presence of something otherworldly. The lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway. These lights were so bright, they lit up the clouds.  I had been in the Air Force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and I NEVER saw lights on a conventional aircraft that were big enough or bright enough to do this, especially since the lights were just as bright coming from the south as they were when they flew out of range to the northwest.  It really frustrated me that there was a straight narrow path of clouds going from the south to the northwest while most of the rest of the sky was clear.  These clouds were slightly puffy and relatively low in the sky.  I would best describe them as stratocumulus, and guess their altitude between 6,000 to 10,000 feet.  I was hoping the lights would make a turn so I could get a better look at them but they stayed behind this narrow path of clouds the entire way and I was never able to see an object.  Also, I should mention that as bright and fast as these lights were, surprisingly I saw no contrails at all.  After the lights went by, I looked around the parking lot to see if anyon! e else s aw it, but no one was around. That in itself was odd. There should have been several people in the parking lot by that time. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was traveling north on I-10 and approaching Prince when I noticed 4 really bright lights hanging in the sky ahead of me. I thought that they might be a plane, but planes never directly fly over or near the freeway. As I approached Orange Grove I could see that they haven't moved since I first saw them. At this time I called my uncle who was at my grandmas house on the east side of town. He went outside and saw the lights too. At Ina, I went directly beneath them and I could see the sky between them so they werent attached. I got off the freeway at Cortaro and pulled in to a Chevron but the lights were gone. No one was around me on the freeway..the lights were about 100 ft if that far above me at Ina. I didn't hear any noise and my car didn't do anything weird. There was no object...just pure light as far as I could tell. My uncle said that 2 of the lights went out and that the other two started to move towards the east side and he went inside to get his glasses and when he came out they were gone.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

My friend and I were heading North on 1st Avenue in Tucson, AZ. We were at a stoplight with considerable light pollution (i.e. yellow street lights, commercial signs, etc.) and were looking straight ahead.  We both saw a bright, steady white light move from the middle right of the windshield to the upper left (East to West) at a high rate of speed-it crossed the windshield in less than 1 second. It dissappeared into the west.  The light appeared to be slightly larger than the size of Jupitor or Venus seen on a dark night. There was no flickering, fading or sparking as I've seen with meteorites before, and the angle of travel seemed inconsistant with an object entering the atmosphere, or even skipping across the upper atmosphere. It looked to be ascending.  The steadiness and clear whiteness of the light gave us the impression it was artificial. The speed, however, was astonishing. We had the impression the light was a good distance away (meaning more than a few hundred yards-seemed like a few miles at least), but have no idea of true distance or speed-just that it was very, very fast. There wasn't any sonic boom or other noise we could associate with it.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

I saw a helicopter in the sky (nothing new around here) but it was orbiting around a bright red light that wasn't moving in the sky. The helicopter was about 1 block away from the object an it had its nose pointed to it the whole time - along with the spotlight on it. There was nothing to see other than the bright red light. As we headed south down the road towards 8th Street (and getting a little closer) I noticed that it could have been 3 bright red lights close to each other. From our position, it was located SE, not too far away, and probably around 100 feet in the air. The helicopter continued to orbit the object with the spotlight on it. My eyes dashed to the road and back up and it was gone. My wife had continued watching and said that it just turned off. The helicopter hung around for about 10 seconds more before heading south. By the time we stopped the car at our house and got to the sidewalk, the helicopter was long gone and there was still nothing in the sky where the helicopter had been orbiting the object.

I looked at the light with my binoculars and i could tell how the light would change shape from round to triangular and then from triangular to round. The light would change shapes constantly. The light then started traveling south again and stopped aproximately above Aviation and Country Club. A helicopter started circling the object (for about 3 minutes) with the spotlight on the object. After the 3 minutes with the helicopter circling the object, the red light turned off and completely dissapeared in less than a second.

From what we could identify, it looked as if the objects were lighting up in different colors, such as blue, red, and orange.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Star in broad daylight;2008-04-24 14:30:00;1 Hour;Star in broad daylight While working on the Tohono O'oddam Reservation, I observed a star like light in broad daylight directly overhead. My first impression was that it was a weather balloon, but it remained overhead for almost an hour with little descernable motion. I pondered whether it was a distant supernova, but have heard nothing over the astronomy news. It looked to be above the troposphere. I say this only as a former meteorologist. There is the slight chance it was a passing asteriod, which I have heard rumors of, but am not sure it was visible during the day.  The little motion I observed was in a NNE direction by no more than 5 degrees for duration of sighting. Eventually, I had to get back to surveying the area, and had to step in a building for an hour or so. The light was not visible when I tried to reaquire it an hour later.  My partner observed the same anomoly, but thought nothing of it. We have not mentioned it since.  Local military air traffic showed no interest in it, either. I watched numerous flights depart the Air Force base only to practice formations and usual touch and go's.  I have released countless weather balloons and tracked their paths across the sky. Never have I observed one shoot straight up, nor remain relatively motionless for an hour. Jet streams and upper level winds usually take the balloon out of sight, or the balloon pops when reaching high altitude.  I do not think it was a UFO (ET), a star, nor a balloon. Stars move west. This object drifted no more than 5 degrees NNE in an hour. Balloons pop or move rapidly to the east after reaching altitudes of 30,000ft and up. A near Earth asteriod is my best guess.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

A fast traveling object that covered great (irregular) distances while blinking multiple colors extremely fast.;2008-05-11 20:00:00;1 Hour & Counting...;A fast traveling object that covered great (irregular) distances while blinking multiple colors extremely fast. My girlfriend and I were driving home from a SubWay restaurant when I saw what appeared to be a malfunctioning airplane. It’s hard to stress in words how distinctly different from an airplane this was, and when I saw it my mouth dropped and I immediately pulled over to the side of the road. I live at the base of a mountain (the outskirts of the city) and was heading north-east when I saw it. After I pulled over to the side of the road and I pointed out what I saw to my girlfriend and she became as awed as I was. Now that I had stopped moving I was able to properly asses what I was looking at. It was a ball of light about four times as big as a star but smaller than an airplane light that was blinking/flashing multiple colors (I’m talking almost every color imaginable) about 10 times per every 1 time that an airplanes light blinks. Basically, if an airplane blinks 2 times a second, this object was blinking about 20-30 times a second in alternating colors like red, blue, green, purple…etc in a hard to catch order (if any). However, that wasn’t the half of it… Its one thing to see colorful flashing (strobe-light like) light, but it’s another to see this object’s crazy movement in the sky. It came from the north-east heading north-west in an irregular, non-linear path that consisted of circles and zigzags with behaviors similar to that of a firefly. It was moving nothing like an airplane/satellite/whatever, and occasionally consisted of dives that dropped the object hundreds of feet in order to regain its altitude only seconds later. At this point I was freaked out enough and decided to call the police for help… I called 911, who forwarded me to the Local Police department where they took my information and told me to keep my eye on the object. I continued to watch the object in its irregular path towards the west when it suddenly seemed to stop in one location for about 10 minutes! It seemed to stay in the same vicinity but make loops, dives and etc, all covering great distances in very short periods of time. Wanting to contact a UFO hotline, I got into my car and drove the remainder of the distance home. When I got home I did a quick search to get to www.nuforc.org and call the hotline support. I talked to someone for a good 5-10 mins about the object I could now barely see in the distance. He told me to call up friends closer to the object (that was now far west) to see if they could spot the object as well. As he was telling me this I noticed a helicopter flying over my neighborhood (with a spotlight) at the intersection I had told the police that I had witnessed the object (I don’t know if that was a coincidence or what). I later drove back to the original place I had seem the object, where I called my friends on the other side of town. They all couldn’t see the object because they lived more into the city and had a harder time seeing stars (because of the many lights) let alone a weird blinking thing. I eventually drove home and filled out this report as the man on the hotline had told me to do.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

A red dot in the sky orbiting a white dot, while the white dot moves across the sky making circles.;2009-01-16 16:10:00;30 minutes;A red dot in the sky orbiting a white dot, while the white dot moves across the sky making circles. I was watching TV when I noticed a white dot through the window. At first I thought it was a star, but then I noticed a red dot next to it. There were no clouds in the sky. It was floating next to a group of small mountains. Both dots were about the size of pinheads. The red dot was “orbiting” the white dot, moving from its left to right side, around it. The white dot moved slowly down and towards the mountains (my left), then up and continuing left. It appeared to be moving farther away, since the red dot was beginning to be harder to see, but I could still make out when it crossed in front of the white dot. This was about 15 minutes in. The white dot then started to make small counter-clockwise circles, stop, then make small clockwise circles. It repeated this about 3 or 4 times. It was very tiny at this point. Every time I looked away to try and make a phone call, it was hard to locate again. The white dot started to move towards the mountains again (my right), so I ran into the house to look for a better camera than the one on my phone, because it was too small to make out. I was in there for about 5 minutes, and when I came back outside it was gone.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
One Hugh object with 3 color lights and Two others smaller objects with white lights;2009-02-21 22:15:00;20 min;One Hugh object with 3 color lights and Two others smaller objects with white lights UFO Report Tucson, Arizona 2-21-09 2-23-09 On 2-21-09, 3 of my friends and I where standing outside talking while I had a smoke break. It was around 10:15 pm. I look in the sky all the time. One of my friends that was with us is an engineer and gets into the paranormal and UFO’s. We talk about it a lot. This was very crazy and much unexpected. Over the Tucson Mountains to our west, we noticed 3 Hugh orange lights and changing colors to red and white. At the same time we noticed 2 more strange white smaller lights over head a lot closer to us. They made no noise what so ever, and there was no running lights or any blinking lights on it.  Looking back over at the 3 lights over the Tucson Mountains as they changed color and where pulsating. Just like the Phoenix UFO on the news some years ago. They went out one by one and out of order. Then with in a couple of short minutes later they showed up over the Silverbell mountains and did the exact same thing then disappeared. My friends where looking at the 2 over our head and did not see the lights over the Silverbell mountains. When I told them too look they disappeared that fast. I looked back at the smaller lights over our heads as they where coming closer too us. These lights where white, and pulsating and moving more up then down. No other lights on the craft. One was just hovering. The second one was moving away to the west of our position. Then it disappeared. Boom! Just gone!  I know none of the objects we had been looking at where any type of plane. Or helicopter. I live right by the Air force base and the Tucson Air Port and see and hear planes every day. The last one that was hovering stayed there for a few minutes, and then it made a very wide circle and went back to where it was hovering. Then did the same thing as the other one did. Slowly moved to the west and in front of all our eyes it pulsated then disappeared. Two days later on 2-23-09 I was standing outside my home looking up into the sky at all the stars and planes still thinking about the other night. When a white light with no running lights or any other blinking lights on it came from the east, very slow. As it came closer I noticed it was not making any sound what so ever. It then got Hugh so bright that it hurt my eyes. It then stopped due south of my home just with in a mile of me. I noticed 3 Air force jets circling it. The light then went down in intensity. Then flu away to the west and then it was gone in a second. The Air Force jets seam to be following it away. After it disappeared the Air Force jets just went back to the base after 5 minutes or so. All I could say is I have been around for 48 years and have been a sky watcher all my life. This was a special few days.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Bright Lights Pretending to be Stars;2009-10-21 00:00:00;15;Bright Lights Pretending to be Stars Rincon Mountains Oct 21 12:00 am - 6:00 am Oct 22/2009  This experience was a first. These lights were not stationary at any point nor were they ever pretending to be stars. They flew PAST us. They made no noise. They came from seemingly nowhere both times, one light at a time. Perhaps the same light visited us both times. On this night my friend and I were at some weird place we came across called X-9 Ranch... it's privately owned land within the Saguaro National Park right by the Rincon Mountains. That night we had two very-low flying bright lights visit us -once to say hello and once as we were leaving. The light was completely silent, the object itself was indistinguishable but I believe it was just pure light. One solid bright light like a candle, with smaller flashing colors in or around it. It flew a bit quirky and nervously, as though it was drawn to us against its will. I think the attention we were giving it made it feel uncomfortable. The first light came from the south in the direction of the city. Though we were both looking in that direction when it appeared, neither of us saw where the light originated from nor did we see it approaching from a very far distance - it just became there. When this first light came I flashed a high-beam flashlight into the sky (the type that beams through the air and can be seen for miles) at it which caused it to start fly/floating a bit drunkardly. It tried to veer itself away from the B-line on which it was coming towards us. Then it just tried to act cool and fly smoothly, attempting to maintain a more android flashing sequence, floating away like it had not notice us.... but in a looking out of the corner of it's eyes at us sort of way. But it was too late for his ruse! He/it had already been busted out and discovered as some sort of an intelligent life form as it responded to our stimuli (both physical, i.e. flashlight and mental/verbal, i.e. thought and verbal! command/request). The second light appeared later coming from the north. My friend and I had both agreed it was time to get going. I turned around from my view of the city to look back at the mountain right behind us and coming up from behind the mountain over the top came an identical light to the one from earlier. I said Look, they came to say goodbye! My friend turned around and said Whoa, where the hell did that come from? I was pleased and we both watched it as it floated/flew awkwardly towards us and jumped a bit in its flight path with the small quickness of a firefly. It was an entity. Oct 20 12:00 am - 6:00 am Oct 21/2009  They perch over the mountains and I drive up to them. Get close to the basin of the mountain and they'll give you a private show. The night before the previous incident the same friend and I were again late-night hiking, this time around the Catalina mountain area. It was a man-made hiking trail and an easy one at that, however it surrounds it's hikers on either side with fencing lined with dense bushes on the left to separate the businesses/housing area and on the right... nothing but desert and barbed-wire fencing beginning where the width of the hiking trail ends and no-mans-land begins. This desert shrubbery was particularly unnerving in an exciting sort of way because there are very dense desert trees, bushes, shrubs and so forth mixed with cacti and all sorts of hiding spots that some sort of stalking predatory animal could come out of.... You could just feel it... I sensed we were in Cat Country. I told my friend the vibe I was getting and he agreed it could very well be. Never the less we journeyed on. We found a little hidden rock area to chill and watch the stars. I had noticed while we were on the trail two aliens positioned over the mountain. (I just call them aliens, a.k.a UFOs). I had my eye on them and went back to the trail to go see them while my friend stayed on the rocks. I watched them and they were the typical posers in the sky trying to look like stars but completely having trouble staying still and they were VERY responsive to thought. I confirmed that those were my aliens for the night and went back to chill with my friend on the rocks. Before long we heard the screams of some sort of animal - probably a bob cat or a mountain kitty - and we reckoned it was time to go. Before we left I stopped my friend on the trail and said Look. See those two aliens? pointing towards them right above the mountain's top horizon. He said Yeah I do... I said Watch, does it look like they are moving? The aliens began to wiggle out of their stationary positions in the sky. I moved my arms, like a conductor of an orchestra, and directed them which way to go in the sky. I would lift up my arm and motion to the right, they would fly that way in the sky in tandem. To the left, and the same. Figure 8 too. I said Are you seeing this?. He said he did. He was astonished and quiet and humble. He took on the same calm awe that I had seen in my other friend who experienced the same phenomenon with me the first time over the same mountains about a month earlier. They just watched in quiet and seemed accepting of it and me, the crazy girl who thinks she is an alien who brings them to the mountains to play with UFOs. I have great friends. lol.

They then stopped (without slowing down, just abruptly stopped) and re-formed into an inverted L (mirror image and up-side-down) shape and began to go straight up VERY FAST (no sound at all).

Softball size soft glowing green light 10-15 feet above ground, beckoning me towards something, very agile.;2011-03-01 18:00:00;5-10 minutes;Softball size soft glowing green light 10-15 feet above ground, beckoning me towards something, very agile. This is less consequential than most reports, but I’ve had it in my head for a little while and now would like to just put it out there in hopes that it helps build the network towards something bigger.  In 2011, I bought my first house in Tucson, Arizona. It’s possible that this occurred anywhere from November 2011 – May 2012. I was outside at dusk doing some light gardening in my front yard when I saw a little green orb, about the size of a softball from my angle. I would guess it was about 15-20 feet above the ground, so not very far. It was moving in a very bizarre and agile way. I could have sworn it was somehow beckoning me to follow it. I went to get my boyfriend, but he was busy, so instead I leashed up my dog. We followed it up the street, all the while it was moving back and forth, reminding me of a child or dog that’s very excited to get you to see something. At the end of the street though, I was suddenly extremely frightened. I turned around and with my dog literally ran back home. I’ve since seen things like drones that have a little light on them, and this certainly wasn’t that. There was no sound, the light wasn’t attached to anything (it was dusk but still l! ight enough to see that), and it was a much larger, softer green glow, a little bigger than the size of a fist. When I got back inside and was breathing heavily from running, my boyfriend was finally intrigued enough to come out and look. But it was gone. Sadly I didn't have a camera phone at the time.   That’s it!

It was about 9:05 Am, I was on a hike with a friend, He said look, look at that I looked up and did not see anything.  I moved and out from behind a saguaro cactus I saw a point of light moving from the west to the east over the Catalina Mountains.  As I watched the light it appeared to tumble or rotate, either description could describe what I saw.  This spot of light  moved perfectly level as it passed over the mountains. I noticed it did not change in it’s brilliance like an aircraft reflecting the sun would.  My best estimate of the area over the mountains that it covered would be about five or six miles maybe more.  As I watch this light my cell phone rang and I answered it, when I finished the conversation the light was gone.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Orange/red ufo over Tucson blinks out;2012-01-18 21:30:00;6 minutes;orange/red ufo over Tucson blinks out Arriving home from grocery shopping I exited the car and paused to admire the clear sky and stars.  I turned looking east toward the city.  We live out of Tucson up in the Tucson Mountain foothills and therefore we enjoy a wonderful view of the twinkling city lights.  I observe aircraft regularly but one light over the middle of Tucson caught my attention.  It was a ball of orange/red light moving at a typical plane speed traveling south to north.  I studied the movement and light trying to figure out it's color, orange or red?  It seemed to be organically shifting from more orange to more red.  I thought atmosphere may be tricking my eyes. It was a solid unblinking color.  For reference, there were two other typical planes in the sky over town at the same time and their white lights with blinking green and red lights were easily visible.  I was waiting to see the familiar plane blinking lights but none were seen.  A funny coincidence happened then when I was! startled to realize that this was no ordinary aircraft.  The amber light stopped moving as I felt an adrenaline wave.  I then noticed that it changed directions promptly and appeared to be headed west in my direction.  I sort of panicked and ran in to get my husband and our two boys out to see the UFO.  Eventually they all came outside.  The light grew or glowed bigger as it approached, though still many miles away.  Although it seemed to be coming straight toward us it started to lose intensity and brightness growing smaller and smaller. Then we all saw the light as it blinked out, nowhere to be seen.  We looked and waited a few minutes for it to reappear but it did not show up anywhere.   My husband was a skeptic about ufo's until he saw this thing he could not understand.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Looked similar to shooting star, but flew much slower and suddenly lit up with incredible brightness and disappeared;2012-05-21 00:50:00;20 sec.;looked similar to shooting star, but flew much slower and suddenly lit up with incredible brightness and disappeared On the early morning of May 21, 2012 my husband and I were arriving home from a get together.  We live in a very dark, remote area of town and it's very easy to see the stars in the night sky. As I was fumbling through my purse for my house keys, my husband was behind me looking back at the sky. I had just seen a shooting star when we were exiting our vehicle, so he was trying to spot one too.  Suddenly, he said &quotlook at that!&quot When I turned around I saw a white light that was flying across the sky over a distant mountain. It definitely was flying at a slower speed than a shooting star but it looked like something similar.  I had enough time to turn around and witness it along with my husband.  All of a sudden, the light grew much, much brighter and in my opinion appeared to &quotblast off&quot from the original speed it was flying. In my husband's opinion after the object lit up it looked to him like it flew down or landed somewhere but it happened very, very quickly.  It was beautiful and truely amazing.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Erratic yellow light;2012-08-13 01:30:00;40 minutes;Erratic yellow light My boyfriend and I were out in a darker area in Northwest Tucson/Oro valley very early morning August 13th to watch the asteroid shower that was said to be happening. While watching for the asteroids i noticed a light north/north-east up in the sky, above and to the left of where Jupiter was last night, that was yellowish, and was moving left and right, down and up, waving, and behaving erratic. I quickly realized it wasn't an asteroid and called my boyfriends attention to it.  He too said that it looked to him like it was moving.   I then moved to put it in perspective with a near-by saguaro to really tell if it was moving, thinking maybe it was just our eyes playing tricks.  Sure enough it was moving to one side of the cactus, to the other. It was moving.  Then all of a sudden it was gone.  Then about 5 minutes later it reappeared, and this time it was higher in the sky, but in the same region.  We got in the car and drove about a mile towards it to get a better view.   It then started dimming, then brightening, sometimes disappearing, and returning quickly. Then it was gone.   We watched for about 10 minutes, and decided we didn't think it was coming back.  As we started to drive away, about 4-5 miles down the road, the light returned, dimming and brightening, until we turned down a street that no longer aloud us to see it.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
A dozen fast moving orange/peach colored lights west of Tucson;2013-04-26 21:00:00;5 minutes;A dozen fast moving orange/peach colored lights west of Tucson I saw 12 bright, fast moving objects coming over the horizon from the west.  (My wife said she counted ten).  At first, I thought someone was shooting flares into the sky.  When I stood up, the objects were seen as coming over the horizon.  They were orange in color (my wife says peach colored).  I've never seen this color when viewing aircraft at night.  The objects veered to the left and appeared to slow down and then faded out of sight.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
A fleet of 20-30 glowing orange orbs flying in linear formation across the nightime horizon in Tucson;2013-05-25 21:20:00;15-20 minutes;A fleet of 20-30 glowing orange orbs flying in linear formation across the nightime horizon in Tucson At around 9:20 PM on the night of May 25, 2013, my husband and I were leaving a restaurant located on Grant Road just west of Tanque Verde, when we saw a fleet of 20-30 glowing orange lights appear from the west of the Catalina Mountains, just about 30-40 degrees above the horizon in Tucson.   They were flying in a linear formation and glided across the mountains moving east and then seemed to disappear.  Do you have any information on this UFO sighting?;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Sabino Canyon Tucson Arizona night UFO sighting.;2013-06-16 21:00:00;5 minutes;Sabino Canyon Tucson Arizona night UFO sighting. At approx. 21:00 on the night of Sun. June 16th, a friend and I decided to take a night hike of one mile up the paved tram road in Sabino Canyon just on the northeastern edge of Tucson, Az.  The night was totally cloudless and there was enough of a moon to illuminate the nearby mountains and distinguish the mountains from the sky above.  We walked to a turn in the road to a stunning view of the canyon towards the west.  As we proceeded just a few yards farther, I noticed a bright light directly on top of one of the flatter mountain mesas to the southwest.  I was wondering why someone was way up in an almost inaccessible location with a flashlight at that hour of the evening. The light proceeded to move at a walker's pace exactly on the top of the ridge line from left to right.  It then began to move faster than a walker's pace but still appeared to be flashlight size and right on the ridge line.  At times it would disappear and then suddenly reappear farther to the left on a consistent basis. The next time we looked towards that location, there was an object in the sky at 1/2 mile distance away just above the ridge line but very clearly in the sky and not on the ridge itself.  I could see it as more of a straight line than an object such as a saucer or anything definitive other than a faint, thin line in the sky.  I would have to estimate the length of this line as approx. 60 feet with a very faint red light on its end to the left and a very bright light on its right end.  It remained stationary for the rest of the event.  The red light stayed consistently very faint and clearly was not blinking in any fashion.  The white light however was laser precise and did not have the &quotcheap&quot star pattern glare of, say, a car headlight. The white light pulsed in an inconsistent way and changed randomly in its sizes.  This part of the event only lasted at the most half a minute.  My friend and I were excited but were also talking about what we had heard about ET experiences.  Many people have related that some alleged ETs are from the star system Zeta Reticula. I was just telling my friend that and precisely when I said the words, Zeta Reticula the light abruptly went out and in a split second made a big flash that my friend later said should have illuminated the mountain side due to its brightness.   The light after this went to the relative size it had been earlier. I don't recall how this object left but in the back of my mind I think it went more to the earlier flashlight sized light and then went out.  This object and lights made no sound whatsoever  and the canyon is a very, very quiet place.  From the beginning of the event to the end the object traversed at most 200 yards of ridge line.  We did not see anything else appear for the rest of our walk up and back. I'm 63 and work in retail.  My friend is in his 50's and is a professional therapist.  Both of us were wearing glasses but our vision is better than 20/20.  The night sky in this canyon is crystal, crystal clear.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
One white light, solid, heading N. to S. and one red light, solid, heading W.to E. both overhead and seeminly near to each other.;2013-07-15 15:30:00;00:2:00;One white light, solid, heading N. to S. and one red light, solid, heading W.to E. both overhead and seeminly near to each other. Time is fuzzy, not really sure how accurate but I usually get up around that time to let my cat in.  I sleep very odd hours, little bits at a time due to the nature of my job as a pharmacy tech at a VA Hospice, as sometimes I am on call. First object was pure white, it looked like a planet which is usually what I look for every night.  It had no twinkle like a star so I immediately went to it and watched it briefly and noticed it was moving and figured it was probably a meteor or a satellite.  It was almost directly over head toward East/Southeast, I had to tilt my head back to observe it.   At the same time this was going on, I noticed a solid red light further East/Northeast moving at the exact same speed as the white light.  Both faded out of sight, nothing real spectacular.   My father was an amateur astronomer so I'm a bit more familiar with stars/planets and other less interesting moving objects in the sky.  I also grew up near an airport and I'm sure it was not a plane as, again, neither lights blinked.  There were no physics defying movements, nothing flashy it just came out of nowhere and then faded out.  It all happen within 2 minutes or less.   I have an interest in UFOs but I am a skeptic as far as belief in ! alien life is concerned, not because I believe we're the only sentient lifeforms that exist but simply because of the apparent vastness of time and space.  This information is important because I've never reported anything like this before.  As an avid skywatcher in an amateur astronomer's heaven in a dimly lighted area of Southeast Arizona.  We do have a main street 2 blocks up and a facility right up the street that contributes to light pollution but other than that we have a pretty good view as opposed to other parts of Tucson and far better than most of Metropolitan Phoenix.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Three large orange lights in a row.;2013-12-03 20:00:00;5 seconds;Three large orange lights in a row On the evening of 12/03/13 I was 1/3 mile up the paved tram road in Sabino Canyon located on the edge of NE Tucson at 20:00.  I saw a sudden flash of 2 large orange lights over west Tucson and then a minute later I saw them again. A couple of minutes later I looked to where the western edge of the Catalina Mtns meets the edge of NW Tucson which was about 25 miles from my position and I saw a large, bright orange light suddenly turn on similar to a light switch being turned on.  A half second later another on came on just a short distance in the sky to the left of the first and then a third all staying on at the same time and in a straight line.  They were just above the horizon line but clearly in the sky. The lights were about 5 times the size of Venus in the night sky and were not emitting the star burst glare of a plane headlight but were more self contained and laser precision.  From seeing videos of the Phoenix Lights incident from the 1990's these lights turned on in progression similar to those.  I saw them for no more than a couple of seconds and then they all switched off at the same time.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
3 bright orange lights seen over east Tucson;2013-12-04 19:00:00;3 minutes;3 bright orange lights seen over east Tucson On 12/04/13 at 19:00 I entered the parking lot of Sabino Canyon which is located on the edge of NE Tucson.  While getting things out of my car trunk for a night walk up the canyon, I looked to the SE over the very eastern edge of SE Tucson and saw a bright orange light about 3 times the size of Venus in the night sky.  The light was  self contained, laser precision and didn't have the star burst glare of plane headlights.  Even though it was self contained and was not emitting a flame in any way, it had the characteristics of being somewhat on fire. This light proceeded towards me from about 10 miles away and then turned and went up into the cloud layer above the nearby Rincon Mtns.  The event lasted about 45 seconds. Just a few seconds later another identical light appeared from behind a nearby hill again to the SE of me but farther west than the first object.  It seemed to be coming up right out of the city itself since it started so low.  Again it traveled somewhat towards me and then went up gradually in the clouds above the Rincons. By this time I had my binoculars out and noted that it had no running lights or any other colored lights around it.  This one took about one minute from start to finish of the sighting. Then yet another one appeared even farther to the west but this time was seen IN FRONT OF a very small hill just 2 to 3 miles away.  It then proceeded for 1 minute to climb up into the cloud layers above the Rincons traveling for one minute or less. There was no wind other than a mile zephyr breeze of 1 to 2 miles an hour.  All of these objects travelled several miles of sky in less than a minute each thus ruling out Chinese lanterns.  Also, it rules out that they came from Davis Monthan AFB since the last light was seen starting it's course in front of the hill just a couple miles from me and also the AFB is located farther west from where the first 2 came from. There was no sound emitted from any of these objects.  I saw the last object VERY clearly through my binoculars and it had no running lights as noted with the 2nd one as well.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

REPORT FROM ATP PILOT:  3 orange orbs size, distance, altitude unknown WSW of Picture Rocks, visible 30 secs, then blinked out.;2014-02-18 19:16:00;30 seconds;3 orange orbs size, distance, altitude unknown WSW of Picture Rocks, visible 30 secs, then blinked out. At dusk, on February 18, 2014, at 19:16, local time, while out for my evening walk, I spotted 3 orange orbs, approximately 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon, to the west, south west of my position, roughly 6 miles south of Picture Rocks, AZ. These lighted orange orbs were near my winter home, west of Tucson, AZ, and this was not my first sighting. The 3 orange orbs first appeared by blinking on first just one, then two, and then three, total.  All 3 briefly became visible at the same time.  First one would blink on, then another, and so on, then one would blink off then back on in random sequence etc.  All three were totally silent, and left no visible smoke, plasma trail or contrail etc. While visible, they appeared to have a very low ground speed, however, with no range or size information, I could not determine their exact speed, altitude or location.  They were arranged in an approximate north/south line from my vantage point, looking west southwest toward the fading sunset, and they did not dart or zoom back and forth. They were only in view for a few seconds, and I pulled out my cell phone to photograph them, but it was too dark.  All three then blinked out within 30 seconds or so, and I noted the time as 19:16, on my cell phone. Having occasionally seen these groups of reddish orange orbs at this location before, I attempted to take a photograph this time, because the sightings appear to be occurring more and more frequently, during the three years I have been wintering over here. There is a lot of regular air traffic in this area, from SWA B-737's, AAL MD-80's, to CRJ 50 and 700 series commuter jets, plus a lot of G/A traffic going into TUS, and Ryan Airfield, located 10nm South and Marana Airport, about 11nm north. I also spot numerous military aircraft over flying this area daily, including KC-135's, C-130's, F-16's, A-10's, Blackhawks and Cobra helicopters etc., mostly operating out of DM AFB or TUS. Additionally, both my neighbor and I operate Hot Air balloons, (mine is a Balloon Works AX-8-B,  90,000 cubic feet) so I am quite familiar with the local traffic patterns, and most types of aircraft in this area. I am also familiar with the difference in color spectrum between tungsten, XENON, HALOGEN, and LED landing lights, and or position/strobe lights, which these orange orbs were not. Just prior to this sighting, there was a flight of two A-10 Warthogs, departing Davis Monthan AFB, on their routine evening patrol.   I see them often, and can recognize them by their two distinctive white flashing strobes. The A-10's were climbing away from my position, westbound, in loose formation, about 250 to 300 knots, at approximately 10,000 feet.  As they disappeared to the west, the orbs appeared behind them, a few minutes later. Shortly after the orbs briefly appeared, and then blinked out, I noticed a small single engine aircraft, southbound, approximately 5 to 10 miles west of my position, around 5 to 7 thousand feet.  I could hear its single engine, and see its steady red position light, as well as its red anti-collision light flashing.  Its ground speed appeared to be 80 to 110 kts but it was too dark to determine the specific type. This aircraft may be the reason for the orbs blinking out, because it appeared to fly through the same area, shortly after the orbs disappeared.  I continued watching for them to reappear, as I walked about two miles back home (approximately 15 min's)  By then it was completely dark, and the objects did not reappear. Over the past 3 years, I have seen these objects around half a dozen times, usually in groups of two to five objects, to the west of my home, mostly in the evening, or early morning hours, and generally low on the west southwest horizon, as opposed to overhead. These internally lit, orange orbs were not parachute flares, balloons, helicopters, fixed wing jets or reciprocating G/A aircraft. They were also not candle powered toy hot air balloons, which my neighbors launch in the evening, from time to time. Having watched the Apollo-17 night launch in person, (DEC 1972), two shuttle launches, and one night shuttle reentry over the South Pacific, (Eileen Collins, Commander), plus a couple of Vandenburg, AFB night missile launches, I am certain these orbs were not chemical powered rockets, either lifting off or on reentry, or the space station. Also they are not the Moon or Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Sirius etc. (wrong color, wrong location)  I can reasonably eliminate all the objects, planets, aircraft and vehicles that I have listed in this report, but I cannot identify what these orbs are. After waiting a little over one hour, I called the hotline and made a verbal report to Peter Davenport around 20:42 local time. I have not previously made a formal report, due to my position in professional aviation. I have seen these orange orbs often enough to confirm they are not my imagination, and feel that my report should be made now, because the sightings appear to be happening more and more frequently. If I were here full time, and had the time to spend looking, I feel that I could probably spot them fairly often in this area.  (just my speculation)  Because I am actively employed in a professional flying position, I must remain anonymous, however, I am more than willing to speak with an investigator.

Flashing moving lights white, blue and red, across the Tucson foothills mountain range.;2014-07-04 21:20:00;30-40 minutes;Flashing moving lights white, blue and red, across the Tucson foothills mountain range. I was looking outside my balcony to the north foothills in Tucson, Az.  A several mile length across the range of the mountains I saw at first soft focus white lights, almost like fireflies.   About 10 of them, then perhaps 20-30 more flashing on and off intermittently.   Then the white lights appeared to blink on and off in a kind of photon white blue, very bright.  Back and forth randomly blinking on and off or just holding position these lights sprinkled on and off.   Then some white lights appeared to streak across the air in front of the mountain range back and forth very fast.  Some of the lights appeared to leave momentary trails of white behind as they zoomed across the sky.  Then some of the blue lights, about 3 or 4 of them to the left blinked on a bright vibrant transparent light above them and looked like a dome shape.  On and off very quickly ... then the blue lights appeared to have a brilliant red light right next to or within it.   The lights danced across the foothills up down all around in various areas.  Then some of the red lights had beams of red light flash on and off here and there.  To my visible eye, these beams were only a couple of inches long beaming down, but could have been yards or more.   I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime.  The strangest thing is that to my eyes these flashes of light would have all appeared separate.   But this morning I awoke and had the strongest impression and feeling that this was ONE invisible craft like a long almond shape, where all this was taking place.  All these lights stayed within this one area, flashing on and off.  If it was a craft it had to be miles long.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

My sister and I have been observing these lights throughout the summer, but only recently have we seen them nightly.  They are small lights that flash white, red, and blue.  Sometimes they move fast, sometimes slowly, sometimes remain stationary for extended periods.  One night we saw them flying northwestward, some of them moving closer to others then moving away, then suddenly one shot directly upward and out of sight while another flew off in another direction and out of sight.  On 10/23 some of the lights were stationary at various points in the sky (in a circle over Tucson) while others were flying either north or south.

It was flying below the altitude of the mountain top and moving very slowly from west to east.  It then appeared to dissolve—just disappeared and then reappeared after about 3-5 seconds, again disappeared, reappeared after about 15 seconds (still very slowly moving west to east) then disappeared for good. The sky was perfectly clear and the sun shining brightly.  Winds are VERY high here today and were averaging 22-26 mph at the time with gusts I’d estimate to be in in the 50 mph range.  No plane I know of could fly that steadily and slowly in the winds blowing as I saw this.  The light was way too large to be a balloon.

Bright lights seen over the Catalina Mtns. north of Tucson;2015-07-04 21:00:00;20 minutes;Bright lights seen over the Catalina Mtns. north of Tucson On July 4th, 2015, at approx. 21: 00, we witnessed a light display above the eastern portion of the Catalina Mtns. north of Tucson, Az.  We were sitting in chairs at the western edge of the Sabino Canyon parking lot and had just watched the fireworks display that  Ventana Canyon Resort puts on for guests.  The sky was heavily overcast over the mountains so when I saw a bright white light appear over the mountains just to the west of the radio towers, I thought it best to turn on my 5X night vision camera and see what it was and I began recording. It was actually 2 lights nearly together in a stationary position far out over the mountains which was easy to tell since the lights were in focus but the radio towers were not since they were closer even though still a few miles away.  Immediately when I turned on the camera, there was a big blue flash near the right side of the lights.  I then zoomed in on the lights and the 2 lights gradually became three in a perfectly spaced row. My camera was mounted on a tripod so the light appeared steady and not moving in the video and that can be gauged also by its relation to the top of the mountain seen below it.  Clearly these lights were in the sky and are not on the mountain itself.   There were big flashes of green lights both near the lights but also well away from them.  Later a similar set of lights appeared out of nowhere next to the original lights to the left of them and when they did the original lights themselves flashed as a large green light. This second set of lights then began to disappear and became a single red light that could be seen moving towards the original lights before it went out.  While trying to get my camera in a better focus there was suddenly a flurry of large flashing lights on all sides of the original lights. The original 3 lights continued to stay in the same place in the sky for a few minutes more and then my camera ran out of memory.  The lights didn't do anything unusual after that but eventually just turned off abruptly.  After about  half an hour the lights came back on in the same location with one bright white light appearing and then 4 more gradually forming a straight line of lights.  They did the same large flashes of light and they appeared to move independently from each other. Lights were seen suddenly appearing and coming from the sides towards the row of lights.  This display lasted several minutes and then just like the first event they all went out like a light switch had been activated. I was with one other person who witnessed the events in a similar way as I did since we were both commenting on what we saw as it occurred.  I wear glasses but my vision is very good.  I'm 66 and am in retail sales.  The other witness is in his 50's and is in the medical sales field.  I've included my YouTube video with this report so feel free to post it on the NUFORC site.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Strange bright blue-white light illuminates entire home then soundlessly vanishes.;2015-09-29 22:10:00;1 minute;Strange bright blue-white light illuminates entire home then soundlessly vanishes. I was sitting with my mother in the living room facing each other having a chat when all of the sudden our entire house lit up in the brightest blue-white light I had ever seen but it didn't hurt my light-sensitive eyes and my mother reported not squinting either. It was as though no shadows existed. I saw light outside the windows but it didnt behave normally. It disregarded the covered porch and came from all angles. My mother saw the same light behave the same way in the windows behind me.  The light was there for about what seemed like 10-15 seconds and there was no sound. After it disappeared I asked my mother what the light was. She didn't know and was unsettled. I ran outside immediately. There were no airplanes or helecopters outside. It was a clear night. I checked the back and front yards seeing if I could find an explaination for the light like a popped fuse or flashlight or anything but had no explaination. The light hadn't moved it just was there then a short while later it wasn't.  I checked the clock after searching and it said 22:25 so u guessed the light happened around 22:10 but did not know what time it was before the strange light that lit up our house so I don't know if we lost time. I tried searching the internet what natural phenomenon might explain this event but couldn't find anything. My mother and I were shaken and confused.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Red-orange lights being followed by helicopter;2015-10-20 01:05:00;1 minute;Red-orange lights being followed by helicopter I was sitting in my house watching TV at 1:05am on Tuesday 10/20/15 in the outskirts of the SW Tucson, AZ area, when I heard a helicopter noise steadily growing even louder.  As I am sitting next to the large picture window, I looked out between the blinds to see 2 small reddish-orange lights moving off to the west, followed by a helicopter with a red & green solid, non-blinking lights. As they were approaching from the city center area of Tucson, I was able to see a dark shape around the red & green lights, showing the shape of the helicopter, with the city glow directly behind it, but I saw no dark shape around either of the small red-orange lights that would determine the approximate size or shape of the craft it was attached to.  Also, the distance between the 2 red-orange lights was slightly larger than the distance between the 2nd red-orange light and the helicopter lights and the 2 red-orange lights were offset, with the first one slightly more north than the 2nd one, but the helicopter lights were in a straight line directly behind the 2nd red-orange light. I distinctly heard one helicopter noise, not several.  As the noise was louder than I can ever remember hearing at this location, as well as the fact that the green & red helicopter lights were large, I believe the helicopter was flying low in the sky as it went directly over my house. I do live near a small airfield called Ryan Airfield, which is 2 to 3 miles southwest of my location, so I am used to seeing small prop planes and small helicopters flying over this area, but never that low or loud.   These lights were not going towards Ryan Airfield to the SW, but almost directly west, maybe slightly north of directly west.   I, on occasion, have also seen military planes and helicopters flying over this area, as we do have both an Air Force base and Air National Guard base located in Tucson, but they never fly this low, and usually are in groups of 3 or more.   With these helicopter groups, it almost sounds like an echo from multiple rotors, but I didn't hear that echo on this occasion. I wrote down the description of this occurrence immediately after it happened, so the details were fresh in my mind. On a separate note, in the 9 years I have lived in this house, maybe 8-10 times I have heard a loud sonic boom type noise that rattled my house to the extent that on a few of these occasions, I ran outside to see if a car had run into my house.  I used to write these sonic boom noises to military aircraft, but as I have heard reports of these noises on Coast to Coast AM, I am not so sure of that hypothesis, especially since I have never witnessed an aircraft to accompany these loud banging noises.  Most of these booms happened during daylight, as several woke me up since I work graveyard shift and sleep usually from sunrise to early afternoon.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Was it a secret satellite or and extremely fast, high flying plane or object?;2015-11-05 05:58:00;3-4 minutes;Was it a secret satellite or and extremely fast, high flying plane or object? At approximately 5:58 am on November 5, 2015, I went outside to take out the recycle container.  As I was walking back to the house I looked up and noticed an extremely clear sky with several bright stars as well as a crescent moon and Venus.   I then noticed one of the bright stars was moving in a straight line from the southwest toward the northeast.  I assumed it must be the space station or a very bright satellite, as it continued in the sky directly overhead and for several minutes remained visible never deviating from it’s course until it finally disappeared to the northeast.   I have a program that identifies satellites and other objects in the night sky so I went in and got on the computer to identify what it was I had just seen.  To my surprise nothing showed up in the program to be flying in that direction and area of the sky at that time.  What was it??

About 7 bright orange or amber colored lights appearing and disappearing, forming a triangular shape at one point, in night sky.;2015-11-17 20:45:00;7 minutes;About 7 bright orange or amber colored lights appearing and disappearing, forming a triangular shape at one point, in night sky. Two orange or amber lights appeared and disappeared around 20:45, moving in a slow snake-like motion.  Then 5 or more lights appeared one after another, lighting up in an upward direction, and formed a triangular shape.  Then all of the lights disappeared quickly in unison and one more light appeared again, which I was able to catch on video.  In total, up to 7 lights appeared but I was only able to capture one on a 1 minute and 15 second long video.   In the video, you can see the dark, clear Tucson sky and crescent-shaped moon above the light.  Stars were visible to our human eye around the moon, but were not bright enough to be caught in the video, and the stars were distinctly smaller and whiter in color than the orange lights we saw.  The lights disappeared at 20:52 and further recordings showed no more lights in the same area as our first recording with the two lights.   This sighting took place near a small airport, however we don't normally see planes or helicopters fly over the area that we saw these lights.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Light sphere becomes hawk.;2016-03-28 12:30:00;60 seconds;Light sphere becomes hawk. March 28, around 12:30 PM I was at my dining table working on my laptop.  The room became very very dark, quite quickly, as if a large and very thick cloud was passing over.   However, the fact it became so dark, so quickly, and cast my dining room into such deep shadow, felt so unusual to me that I decided to go outside to my patio to see just how large a cloud might be passing over.   Even though it was a windy day and there were scattered white clouds in the area, a cloud capable of such a shadow just didn’t seem logical to me.  When I got outside and out from under my veranda roof, I did take note of a large cloud moving away from the sun but as the sun was still partially shrouded the cloud I couldn’t look directly at it… the sun was too bright.  The cloud was moving northeast and the sun was high and to the south. A very large red-tailed hawk attracted my attention, soaring against a clear blue background of open sky at about 1000 feet or so, and slightly to the north.  Its markings were clear and distinct, a beautiful thing to witness, so I whistled a hawk call, twice.  It turned, and I whistled the call again.  At that time a bright sphere appeared far above the soaring hawk, a point of light, bright, white…  Not bright like a star or a landing light.  But it was a point of light, very unusual… so I fixated on it.  I focused on it for around five to seven seconds, and observed it grow in size, and it didn't move much either.   Then a streak appeared to extend from the right side of this ball of light, like a flare, and I recall thinking I would describe flare as “feathery”.  All at once the white sphere seemed to flash, to expand and was gone, and then, in its place and right next the soaring hawk that had originally attracted my attention, appeared an identical hawk.  They soared in formation for a bit, criss-crossing paths, something I'd seen before, and after 20-30 seconds the original hawk turned and headed to the south/southwest.  The hawk that had just appeared turned north and I lost sight of it. I know the human eye can play tricks on the mind, and there may well be a logical and natural explanation for this sighting.  The other hawk may have been far above the first, and out of focus in an empty field of blue sky considering my eyes were moving, following the first hawk.  It is possible the second hawk decided to dive directly down to join the other and was backlit by the sun as it dove.  But for this to happen right overhead, as I was calling to the first hawk... strange.  I am not given to fantasy or wishful thinking…  I was a 3000+ hour USAF pilot, and after that, an engineer for McDonnell-Douglas and Boeing.  I retired from Boeing 10 years ago.  I have a degree in Biological Sciences and am somewhat well grounded in the basic sciences including physics and chemistry.  I consider myself to be an objective observer and am quite familiar with the principles of science and experimentation.  I also am an avid observer of nature, and have been for years.  I live in the country, on an acreage, near Tucson, Arizona. Whatever I saw was remarkable, even if explainable by natural avian behaviors and the orientation of the sun.  However I will tell you that I have seen large hawks soaring at great heights before diving right down to near ground level within feet of me, and with the sun high.  The hawk in that case was a dark speck that quickly grew as it sped toward me, wings tucked.  It didn’t come out of a ball of light. So I’m wondering who else might have reported some similar experience.  A hawk coming out of a ball of light, the light flares and poof there's a hawk.  As I said, I’m not inclined to assume anything supernatural, paranormal, or other-worldly at this time, but I am willing to entertain the possibility.  I’ve encountered UFOs during my flying career and had a friend in the intelligence field who took reports from aircrews who experienced stunning and frightening encounters… so for me, it’s all on the table.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

To the N of Tucson saw a still light suspended in the sky.  It appeared to be moving ever so slowly.  ((anonymous report));2016-05-19 21:11:00;15 seconds;To the north of Tucson saw a still light suspended in the sky.  It appeared to be moving ever so slowly.  I thought it was a sudden planet like Jupiter or Mars are currently brighter than any star currently.  Stars blink, aircraft have flashing lights and move more quickly through the sky.  I watched it as i knew it was out of place, with planes blinking in the background and stars pulsing around.  Suddenly the movement was more obvious and it started to dim and it did, like a light bulb being turned off it dimmed into a dull point and disappeared in the matter of 2-3 seconds and was gone.  Like it went up.  I saw a similar incident 10 days ago but it disappeared behind a tree to the east.   18 months ago i saw something similar, but appeared more like a slow motion shooting star, going upwards.  Even saw a small fire trail. I watch planes and helicopters almost every night, seen meteors and shooting stars.  You learn flight paths and how to identify these things.  And also like the 3 incidents I mentioned you can tell what seems backwards or unnatural (including inhuman as far as we know).   Just wish i could see these in the day, seems I only see them shortly after night fall and only within the atmosphere.  Just sharing because I see a lot of this around Tucson but can never find reports. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Constellation of 14-30 dim lights, 3 bright blue lights performing maneuvers.;2016-07-07 21:30:00;1 minute;Constellation of 14 to 30 dim lights, 3 bright blue lights performing maneuvers. On Thursday, July 7th, 2016, two friends and I were leaving the Star Pass Resort in the Tucson Mountains, west of Tucson, at about 9:30 or so.  After having dinner there, we walked out the east side of the resort headed to the parking lot.  We looked up into the northeastern sky to see a group of “stars” all of moderate intensity among thin wispy clouds centered about 40 degrees above the horizon line.  Because the night was partly cloudy, there were very few stars visible and I found it quite odd to see so many visible “stars” of similar intensity grouped equidistant from one another.  I thought there were about 14-16 lights. One of my two friends believed there were more than 20. He then exclaimed that they were slowly moving.  I looked closer, comparing the relative proximity of two of the lights and was amazed to find he was correct. At that moment, a bright blue light, the brightness of a significant meteorite and much brighter than the other lights, fell straight down, zig zagging slightly before it disappeared from our line of vision behind a wing of the hotel.  At that moment, two other bright blue lights of similar intensity passed over our heads on parallel paths.  We were swearing in amazement quite a bit at this moment.  They continued steadily across the sky until they met up with the more distant, dimmer lights in the misty cloud bank to the northeast.  This took about 15 seconds.  When they joined the other lights they took on the same level of light intensity.  Then they all faded away simultaneously. I am a native of Tucson, 47 years old with a Master’s degree.  I grew up staring at the stars and have never seen anything like this before.  My friends are 48 and 54 and are also well educated men.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

I thought it might be the star Sirius which I have seen in that direction before but it never jumped or disappeared.  I looked up a map and it was in direction of Dove Mountain. I was a presenter at the MIT Alien Abduction Conference years ago and have never and have never seen a UFO before.  For some reason I was drawn to the light when I was in the kitchen.

A family member told me it was Venus due to atmospheric temperatures.  Is this true?  Anyway, I've been looking at Venus all my life and never seen it move.  Period.

Two points of light blinking, changing color, and moving very unusually.;2018-04-02 05:38:00;>10 minutes (continuous);Two points of light blinking, changing color, and moving very unusually. I have been seeing lights in the direction of the AFB for quite some time, especially in the couple of hours just before dawn, but they seem to be more blatant and odd lately.  They appear as points of light that are either white, red, or green and they move rather strangely.  Sometimes there is only one light moving around but lately there have been two. They move laterally, diagonally, and vertically.  The oddest part to me is that sometimes they appear to be shaky.  They show these little micro-movements that remind me of Somebody with a shaky hand holding a laser pointer. This night there were two lights vertically stacked on each other.  They would blink on and off and change color (white to red), and they seemed to be able to move both independently and in unison.  In addition to these lights that I normally see, two nights ago (4/7/18) in the same direction there was what appeared to be a normal aircraft, moving normally, with blinking white lights and a stable red light.  However, it would be ascending diagonally, get to the same point in the sky, and then disappear only to reappear where it began and follow the same trajectory again.

Initially, there were 4 flashing lights of equal brightness in the western, slightly north-western sky at abut 45 degrees from the horizon.  We were viewing these lights from the far east side of Tucson.  What was odd was that they stayed completely stationary for a few minutes.  Three continued this way while one approached another and then stopped flashing.   Eventually they seemed to retreat into the distance and the flashing became fainter.  As they faded, they gave the impression that they were reflecting pulses of light rather than emitting flashes because of how the light seemed to scatter as if reflecting off a surface.  It was sort of like they were retreating into a haze.  It reminded me a little of the footage I have seen of the lights above Phoenix.

What we saw and for how long:  We both saw five goldish looking lights, about 40 degrees above the horizon lined up horizontally but tilted slightly,  The left most light was significantly brighter (about as bright as a car headlight from a quarter mile away) than the others.  The distance was hard to judge but I would guess between 2 and 3 miles.  They appeared to be drifting slowly to the west (left) and all of a sudden they just disappeared, as if a light switch was turned off. We saw these lights for about 10 seconds before they disappeared. What we didn’t see: We didn’t see the lights appear, other than when we noticed them, so we can’t vouch for how long they were visible. We did not see a craft or crafts that may have been emitting the light.  There were no blinking lights associated with them, as seen on normal aircraft in fact as we continued to drive north, about a mile and a half past the original sighting, we did not see any aircraft in the area at all.  The lights did not behave like fireworks, military aircraft flairs, drones or shooting stars, all of which we have seen many times. About us: I am an Engineering Technician/Metrologist and my wife is a teacher.  We are both sky watchers and have witnessed many unusual things in both the daylight and night skies.

Saw two red/orange dots rising to the southeast they weren't blinking like a plane, just slowly rising.;2020-10-05 01:25:00;15 seconds;Saw two red/orange dots rising to the southeast they weren't blinking like a plane, just slowly rising. I frequency have insomnia. I woke up just after 1:00 am this morning, want to the bathroom, and couldn't go back to sleep. I went out to the backyard to bring in laundry from the clothesline, and was folding it, facing east.  I glanced up and saw two red/orange dots rising to the southeast. They weren't blinking like a plane, just slowly rising. The dot on the left started to fade, and then disappeared, followed by the one on the right. This lasted about 15 seconds or so.  A few minutes later, there was one dot rising in the same location. I was able to capture it on my cell phone.  The Davis-Monthan Air Force Base is southeast of me, in the vicinity of where the dots were. Could this be something coming out of the base?;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Steady line of small lights travelling west to east in Tucson approximately 18:45 December 2, 2020;2020-12-02 18:45:00;two minutes;Steady line of small lights travelling west to east in Tucson approximately 18:45 December 2, 2020 Traveling west to east. Objects were steady traveling dots of light that at first seemed like a helicopter formation.  There were no beacon lights nor any color than white dots.  It was as if a line of dots was being pulled across the sky.  There was not any sound such as propeller, jet or rotors.  The pattern was an imprecise pair of dots with a space between each pair similar to the width of the pair.  Picture:dot, small space, dot, large space and then repeat.  As the lights were steady, I can not be certain they were not connected.  Almost as strange, there was a finite range of the lights as if they turned north and so out of sight.  The dots were no brighter than the stars they were flying before.  Imagine looking at a neon sign in Times Square where the message banner went around the corner. The lights were moving when I first noticed them and stopped within a couple of minutes. I am in this area often and have never seen anything like it. I asked a coworker who recently left the Air Force what he thought.  There is a base on the opposite corner of Tucson.  He offered ideas but without beacons eliminated helicopters, military drones or planes.  We also eliminated the large flares since there was no loss of altitude. The sky was quite clear and sunset was more than an hour earlier so the view was fairly optimal.  I did not try to take a photo and think the lights were not bright enough for a phone photo.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
A series of unusual lights seen in the Southern skies of Tucson;2020-12-09 00:00:00;1 hour;A series of unusual lights seen in the Southern skies of Tucson At 3A and unable to.sleep i decided to take a walk and see if that would calm my mind. I always look up.at the sky...looking for.stars, watching.aircraft from the airbase, spotting satellites, and identifying.the large number of.drones that are being used in our skies. I pretty much know  what lights are requiired and where they must.be placed on aircraft and drones....my hobby.has.been.all.about identifying these things. I noticed two propeller driven aircraft approach from the west in the flightpath to.the airforce base. I then noticed two lights...some.type of craft with only a simgular light that appeared to be rotating and.changing color very quickly from red to blue to orange, then green and back.to red. They also had the appearance of blinking, but.it was not in a synchronous pattern as one would see in all aircraft. These lights quickly.came.from the east and.then positioned.themselves above and.below where.the.aircraft would pass. As.the.aircraft gr! ew close to.these lights.they both disappeared, only.to reappear after the aircraft had passed. These lights.then moved erratically, hovering at times. Eventuly.both went to an area of the sky that was about five miles east of where.they had been.  The southernmost light divided and became two lights..the southernmost light rapidly.accelerated towards Mexico. The two.lights then proceeded to do a dance...at times.touching..and moving up towards the level where cirrus clouds could.be seen. The last time they.hovered just under the.cloud and one could barely see that.there were apx ten other lights.just above the cloud dancing as well. One light.then disaapeared, the other drifted in a.drunkenly manner towards the northeast.  Nothing else appeared, and it was now 0400. At 6A i went.back outside just in time to see a similar object enter my field of view and quickly head west were when it reached the Tucson Mountains began to follow the crest if.this small range.northward. Upon reaching the location of Wasson Peak (highest point.of the range) it gave a brilliant white flash and dissapeared. I sited one other.odd object during.this.time. The constellation Orion was low.in the Southwestern sky heading.for its.setting.  I noticed what appeared to be a sattelite moving towards the.northeast, i.noticed it when it was passing over an orange colored star, both being perhaps 20 degrees to the north of Bettelguese. As i had been looking at Orion i found it odd that the trajectory of.this.sattelite meant it.had come through.the field if view looking at Orion. I should have seen it there, but did not. I then noticed that this orange star was.moving.very slowly....i checked Orion to see.how.fa! st it was moving towards he horizon.  It was moving much slower.than the.orange star. .Orion also.was moving.in a straight trajectory towards the west. This.star moved in an.erratic pattern towards WSW....not the direction nor speed that all.stars would.be seen as doing. I decided it.was time to.head.in and get ready for.the.day, so.i did.not see anything elae.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Seen at first as a stationary single point of bright red light, against blue sky, then as changing colors of red, white and black;2020-12-12 16:50:00;5 min;Seen at first as a stationary single point of bright red light, against blue sky, then as changing colors of red, white and black Two of us saw, at first a stationary single point of bright red light against blue sky, then as changing colors of red, white and black, as if it was falling and tumbling while stationary at the low flight level over city at 4:50 pm on 12/12/2020 to the east of our house. Then, it blinked out with no sound and no trail. We saw and heard a plane, coming from the west, go over to the same low flight level spot in the sky, three to five minutes later.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Orange erratic light over Tucson;2021-01-02 18:28:00;1 minute;Orange erratic light over Tucson I was walking to the store and happened to look above me and noticed a strange orange colored light floating in a west to east orientation parallel to the Catalina Mountains. The light was flickering erratically and was making no noise. I noticed that another aircraft was above it at the time and was flying north. The object was behaving differently from the normal aircraft you see at night. It was not flashing red to white in rhythm, it was flashing orange to white randomly vanishing in out in brightness. Also, the movement was slow and erratic as well. When it got close to the Rincon mountains, it completely vanished. The observer has never before seen or witnessed any UFO activity, but is a frequent star gazer.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
