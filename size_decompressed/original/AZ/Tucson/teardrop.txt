Object seen and photographed flying in and out of chemtrail in Tucson Arizona;2005-04-26 10:00:00;15 minutes;Object seen and photographed flying in and out of chemtrail in Tucson Arizona Having moved some furniture into our new home in Tucson the day before, myself, my wife and my wifes friend decided to put the top down on our Jeep and take a ride through our new neighborhood.  We noticed that there was one very large and very new chemtrail in the sky, having been laid west to east.  We got about 3 blocks from the house when our friend in the back seat said you better look up.  We looked up and sitting next to the chemtrail was an object either reflecting sunlight, or it was self-luminous, we are not sure which.   We stopped and watched the object which was moving very slowly. It moved into the chemtrail and then slowly drifted out again.  We were unable to make out a definite shape but could tell that it had some sort of protrusion jetting out from it.  As we sat, the chemtrail began to drift and diffuse somewhat.  As it drifted, the object also drifted with it, following it.  It continued to move in and out of the chemtrail.  Having no camera with us, we raced back to the house to retrieve a camera.  As we drove in, we found our two sons were outside and they were also watching the object.  By the time I got the camera the chemtrail had drifted a good ways away from us and the object was almost undiscernable.  I put the digital camera on zoom and snapped a shot, which I include with this report.  Although Davis Monthan AFB is close by, I dont think it was from out of there.  (I know because I was stationed there in the 70's),  I submitted these photos to Dr Bruce Macabee and it was he who requested that I submit this report to you. ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC is not yet receptive to the notion that chemtrails are anything but contrails, generated by high-altitude aircraft.  However, we post this report because of the reported anomalous object, which allegedly was seen drifting with the presumed contrail.  PD));32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Unidentified object sighted east side tucson;2008-09-24 13:00:00;15 seconds approx.;Unidentified object sighted east side tucson Driving west bound on Broadway blvd I stopped at the light on Camino Seco rd. While at the light, I noticed a flat mettalic object, somewhat oval, maybe teardrop in shape. It wasnt too reflective but definately stood out in the sky. Hard to tell distance from me ( rough estimate 2 miles away, 10-15 thousand feet elevation). No noise was heard but if it was an aircraft, it was close enough to hear something. It was traveling west-southwest very quickly. The object completely dissapeared from my view in about 15 seconds. The path it traveled was completely straight. There were no lights at all, and no jetstream trail.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Object over Tucson pursued by Air Force jets after entering local air space.;2013-09-20 20:02:00;14-18 seconds;Object over Tucson pursued by Air Force jets after entering local air space. Watching military jets taking off from Tucson International Airport when object came into view from extremely high in the western sky traveling to the southwest.  One of the F15's made a quick bank toward the teardrop shaped extremely bright desending craft which didn't look like anything my friend or I have ever seen in the clear sky over this city.  The object was gone as fast as it came well before the jet could turn to chase it.  About 10 minutes after sighting the sky was full of military aircraft to the south of the city.  We have a major Air Force base hear in Tucson, most of the aircraft came out of that base to search for whatever the unusual object was or where it went.  I checked with our local tv news channel to see what they could add, they recieved many calls but could not get any answers from local sources.  I've been a pilot flying in this area for many years as well as around the World and have never seen an object flying as fast and change directions as quickly.

Hundreds of small flickering white lighted objects  floating quickly across the sky.;2016-07-07 21:30:00;4 minutes;Hundreds of small flickering white lighted objects  floating quickly across the sky. Objects were small, high in the sky, and seemed to flicker.  They moved across the entire sky, from W to E, within a span of a few minutes--the length of time it took to get another family member out to see the last few objects, as they slipped into the cloud cover.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
