We pursued two giant gray flying cubes for 20 minutes;1989-05-10 11:00:00;20 mins;We pursued two giant gray flying cubes for 20 minutes Looking northwest from downtown Tucson I saw two dark gray cubes, roughly the size of small houses, at a height of approx. 400 feet, in loose formation, traveling horizontally toward the west northwest. My female friend and I (male)(we were both students at the Univ. of Arizona at the time, living off campus), hopped on my motorcycle, a 1985 Honda 500cc Interceptor, and began pursuit, heading toward Phoenix on Interstate 10. I was riding in excess of 90 mph. They were out of site for several minutes, but became visible again once we cleared some hills south of Marana, AZ.  They were 2 or three miles away toward the west.. we took an offramp.. Tangerine Rd.. maybe.. and continued high speed pursuit. They had decreased their altitude to about 100 feet above ground..i got within a quarter mile.. they were dark gray.. matte finish..no visible protrusions, holes, or lights.. just plain gray cubes...traveling together.. but moving independently,, bobbing up and down. They increased their speed to match ours apparently.. never letting us get closer than about 1/4 mile. They settled over a rise in the road.. and in the 12 to 15 seconds it took us to reach the rise they were no where in sight. I reported it to Davis Monthan AFB...after playing phone tag for 30 minutes,, mostly on hold, they told me that the giant cubes we saw were marker ribbons dropped by the Air Force.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Bright, rectuangular object suddenly disappears in day sky.;2009-07-08 11:12:00;20 seconds;Bright, rectuangular object suddenly disappears in day sky. I saw a very bright, metallic, rectangular object in the sky, with what I assumed was a wing on the side.  I thought for sure it was an airplane. But, the object suddenly disappeared, which was very unusual.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Rectangular Grid over Catalina Mountains in Tucson, AZ;2011-08-09 20:15:00;3 MIN;Rectangular Grid over Catalina Mountains in Tucson, AZ On August 9, 2011 in Tucson, Arizona at around 8:15 pm I was driving north on Craycroft Road approaching Sunrise Road. The sky was dark but clear.  As one drives north uphill, the Catalina Mountains lie directly ahead. Some blinking white lights on the west slope of the mountain, near the top, caught my eye. I saw a very large rectangular grid with white (round)lights. There were about three (3) rows of 5 white lights. They formed a very large rectangle. There were 3 red blinking lights wthin the grid as well. I slowed my car and thought possibly it was something new that the city had placed there for planes (?. I have lived in north Tucson for 18 years and have never seen these lights there before. The rectangular grid was almost the size of two football fields. It tilted back and forth for a moment and then the entire grid went from a vertical to a horizontal plane. It then went northward and disappeared over the Catalina Mountains.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Object flew across the sky and then straight up until no longer visible.  Fast.;2016-10-16 12:45:00;4 minutes;Object flew across the sky and then straight up until no longer visible.  Fast. I saw what appeared to be a rectangle fly across the sky.  At first it looked like a plastic bag blowing in the wind, but it was too high for that.  The object then flew straight up into the sky until I could not longer see it.  It moved fast, and in different directions while flying up.  It appeared to be spinning because I could see different contrasts such as it appeared shiny on at least one side.

Electric Blue Rectangled Object;2019-01-18 13:21:00;4 minutes;I had completed my shopping & took a seat outside of the Frys store to wait for my driver. As I sat there enjoying the beautiful day, looking south across Speedway Blvd behind the Walgreens on the South side Of the street. I noticed this Electric Blue rectangled object just hovering over the near top of a Blue Palo Verde tree situated behind the Walgreens in the desert. I grabbed my Android, engaged the automatic button triggering the camera & just let it rip. Then just as quick as this electric blue rectangled object appeared. Poof.  It was just gone. Quite possibly due to the bright desert sun none of the pictures revealed my sighting. The incident sighting that lasted approximately 4 minutes. That day was not my first sighting. Years ago up in Sedona I spotted several sightings. Those sightings were of silver spheres. There ya have it. Thank you for your mission in pursuing the truth.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
I witnessed a large, dark rectangular craft with at least 7 very bright white orb-ish lights hovering low in the sky over Tucson.;2019-01-22 23:07:00;~25 seconds;I witnessed a large, dark rectangular craft with at least 7 very bright white orb-ish lights hovering low in the sky over Tucson around 11:00 PM on Tuesday, January 22nd. I was driving North toward the Catalina Mountains when I turned my gaze to the left and was startled by an intense set of lights on a large, pitch-black object which appeared to be within 5-6 blocks West of my intersection.  I was startled by how large the object appeared to be compared to usual aircraft, how close it appeared to me, the intensity and unique semi-linear organization of the lights, and by the fact that the craft appeared to be stationary in the sky.  It was lower than a helicopter would typically be, but was larger and flatter than a helicopter. I immediately pulled over with the intent of getting a picture.  Once I was stopped and facing the object straight on, I noticed the rectangular shape and what appeared to be a projection on the far dorsal surface, with some of the lights set further back on the craft than others (in contrast to the semi-linear arrangement of my initial perspective).  Within about 3 seconds of me getting a good look at it from this view, it began a Southeast descent at only about 10mph faster than what I'd expect from a typical aircraft.   At this point I considered that perhaps it was just a helicopter, but I did not hear any sound as it descended and the shape of the object was more bizarre from the sideview, appearing wide across and essentially flat.  One light flashed a couple of times at a quick/strobe-like rate while the others were larger, had a slightly more yellowish hue, and remained constant. I turned my car back around the way I'd initially come, to try and follow it, but by the time I had stopped at a stop sign and turned South, it had gone.  This seemed unusual to me because my view of the horizon was fairly good, and at the speed I had seen it travelling (55 miles at most) I fully expected to still see it after the ~5 seconds it took to get my car reoriented, but I saw no trace whatsoever. No one in surrounding cars seemed to see it, but I did feel uncomfortable with how low and near me it seemed, and I got the impression that it responded to me pulling over to face it because it had been hovering in the same spot while I was watching it while still driving, but started descending/moving away a very short time after I pulled over.  The only other thing I can think to note is that there had been a power outage 4-5 hours prior in that area, including outage for the traffic lights of the intersection I was at when I saw the object.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
