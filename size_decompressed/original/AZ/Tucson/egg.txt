About 10 minutes later it rose out of the trees and traveled straight at me at a constant speed. It then hovered about 30 feet in the air less then 50 feet from the house. The object then traveled north gaining altitude at a steady rate, its color changed black and could be seen for a long time before disapearing. It made no noise and created no air disturbance.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Then Maybe like half a second later, both lights were separated so far apart.  One light faded off and stayed off.  The other faded on and off 2 more times and finally faded off completely.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

I went to our backyard and in the southern sky was a bright red egg shaped object moving very slowly in a northerly direction.  My 16 year old son came out and also witnessed this. For 3-4 minutes we watched. The light made no sound and it was steady, as in not blinking like aircraft lights.  The light then traveled very slowly to the west then then extremely rapidly appeared to head back south.  In less than 3 seconds the light was out our visual range.   As an Air Force veteran and retired police officer, I have never seen an aircraft of that color or that moved like this one did.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
