Ten large round solid, non-blinking, reddish-orange orb-like lights flying in formation over Tucson, AZ.;2016-12-23 17:30:00;2 minutes;Ten large round solid, non-blinking, reddish-orange orb-like lights flying in formation over Tucson, AZ. While a passenger in our car heading south in Tucson, Arizona,  I glanced out the window and saw approximately ten large bright round reddish-orange lights flying in formation in the western sky. They formed two parallel but slightly “zigzag” rows: the first few lights forming a straight east to west line with the rest of the line continuing slightly farther back the second row of lights created an identical row behind it, each light being equidistant from the one in front of and beside it.   The first thing I did was lower the car window to rule out reflections on the glass. I could make out no forms nor sound of aircraft and these lights were solid, not blinking as normally seen on aircraft.  They were not individual lights on a larger craft as I could make out faint clouds in the sky behind and between them.  I watched them move Northward across the sky until I couldn't careen my neck any farther out the car window to see them.  They maintained the same formation the entire time, and did not “fade out” as flares would.   I waited to file a report until I had a chance to:  1) drive down the same stretch of road again, at the same time of day, to see if there were any extremely high light poles or radio towers, etc., that could have accounted for the lights and  2) contact the local Air Force base to confirm whether they had conducted any drills, flare releases, or other such maneuvers that night.  The answer was no on both counts.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

The first one came from the north followed by some from the north east then they started coming from the north west and then the West all of them flew to pretty much the same point near the star Arcturus then turned and headed south east all heading to the same place they were all whitish yellow and very high (higher than most planes) in the sky they were also very hard to see and didn't seem that bright on account of them being at such a high altitude I heard no jet engines or propellers some of them were flying quite close to each other while the majority flew one after the other about 45 seconds apart from one another I have a feeling that all the pilots were Cozicci (spelt with backwards C's) from Sirius A's- Deneb;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Red/orange lights lined up in formation high above Tucson AZ;2020-11-12 19:35:00;1-3 minutes;Red/orange lights lined up in formation high above Tucson AZ 2-6 Red/orange lights appeared in the sky looking west, was driving west on Broadway blvd near Harrison rd  2 lights appeared to be next to each other at first, then the left light rose higher with great speed, then disappeared  As it disappeared, another light appeared to the right of the lower light, then 2 more appeared in the same fashion leaving 4 lights lined up in the sky, evenly space out  The far-left light then disappeared as another on the far right appeared, this repeated 3 or 4 times before they all disappeared at once, fading out quickly.  Similar to the first formation of 2 lights, another 2 appeared right as the rest faded.  The lights started traveling west (same direction as me) and I lost sight of it behind some buildings and trees, I was looking to the right side of the road.  This is the second time I saw this kind of phenomenon.  The first time was 12 years ago near Maurenci / Clifton AZ while I was out camping on spring break with some family/friends.  After the sighting that night, a few moments later, 3 or 4 military jets came out of nowhere and circled the area we saw the lights.  They left as quickly as they arrived.  It was more than bizarre and I’m amazed to have had the privilege to witness it yet again.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Five of us watched a formation of about 40+ sparkling objects fade in and out below the moon for about 10 minutes.;2021-01-01 00:10:00;10 min;Five of us watched a formation of about 40+ sparkling objects fade in and out below the moon for about 10 minutes. Just after New Year's Eve midnight, our group of five was outside. One member of our group looked up at the moon and exclaimed: Look! She pointed toward the moon, which was full and bright in the southeast. We all looked up. At first, we were silent. Then we started saying many things like: I see it! Do you see this? I can't believe it! This is not natural or man-made!  The formation had 40 or more lights. The lights were spread out in a vertical band, ranging from below the moon down toward the horizon. Each light was a separate sparkle made of short, thin, sharp, crisscrossing, radiating lines. Each sparkle was small relative to the overall formation. Four out of five in our group saw different colors among the sparkles. The fifth in our group (me) had coated eyeglasses and did not see the colors. The sparkles did not look like stars. Each sparkle would be in the same spot for about 15 to 30 seconds, then fade. But the approximate number of sparkles in the formation stayed the same for most of the time that we observed it. Then the sparkles started to fade and disappeared entirely over one or two minutes. The overall formation stayed in the same general area but constantly shifted slightly as some sparkles faded in and others faded out. The overall shape of the formation was resembled a geometric kite, with more sparkles at the top closest to the moon, and with fewer sparkles ranging down along a kite tail decorated with knots. The overall shape of the formation, though, was not distinct or familiar, and it did not maintain a consistent shape. The formation was visible for about 10 minutes and then the number of visible sparkles started to fade. Within a minute all of the sparkles were gone. I photographed and filmed some of the event with my iPhone, but the formation does not seem visible on my phone or on my desktop. While we were watching, someone in our group said it was like plankton glowing at night in the sea. Four of us had seen pictures of glowing plankton and agreed there was a similarity. The major difference was the sparkling characteristic of each object in the formation versus the glow of plankton at night.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
