A bright steadily flashing light traveled across the dark sky then turned its direction toward me and hovered about 25' in front of me;1972-08-02 23:00:00;5 minutes;A bright steadily flashing light traveled across the dark sky then turned its direction toward me and hovered about 25' in front of me Sitting about 14 feet from a large window looking through a thick mesquite grove to the dark northern sky a small (approximately 8 in diameter) bright light came into view from the west.  It was moving fast and flashing on and off.  When it was directly in front of me it changed directions and came down toward me straight through the trees with no sign of movement to avoid the trees or their branches. I was absolutely fascinated and with no fear. Within a minute or two I stood approaching the large window, cupped my hands around my eyes to get a better look into the dark night.  The light hovered directly over a low retainer wall separating the front lawn from the mesquite grove and continued its steady flashing. Suddenly apprehensive I started walking past a wall of windows toward the bedroom and watching as the light followed my path.  The bedroom drapes were closed so I carefully peaked through the opening only to find the light hovering outside the bedroom window.  While watching another few seconds it suddenly disappeared. I felt the light (or whatever it was) saw me sitting in the dark in the house and came to investigate or document my being on film.

UFO emerges from behind a single cloud;1974-06-01 13:00:00;15 minutes;UFO emerges from behind a single cloud While traveling on my motorcylce about 40 miles S/W of Tucsan, AZ I noticed a cloud in the sky. There hadn't been any clouds that day. The cloud appeared to be coming closer as it was expanding in size. The cloud stopped and from behind it a metalic appearing cylinrical shaped object moved rapidly southward.There were no sounds. I got off my motorcycle while this was happening and got my binoculars. I looked for the object but it had disappeared so I watched the cloud as it rose upward and out of site. This happened in an area where there were no telephone poles or homes.  About five minutes went by while I stood there watching and the cloud reappeared and moved back toward nearly the same spot. I saw the object moving toward me from the south. It slowed as it seemed to enter or go behind the cloud. The cloud rose again until it disappeared. I immediately returned to Tuscan. I attempted to report this occurance to The AF base and to contact the radio stations. This was done by phone and I never heard another thing about it. I was shook up for weeks by what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Phasing Cigar UFO over NE Tucson AZ;2004-12-07 17:18:00;seconds;Phasing Cigar UFO over NE Tucson AZ I was just taking random pictures of the snow up in the mountains. This wasn't visible in the normal spectra. But the camera picked it up. It appears to be moving fast or enveloped in some sort of magneto/gravitic field. Picture is up on the Coast to Coast AM page as well I have the orginal picture as it came from the camera which is a Canon Digital Rebel EOS 300D but am submitting a cropped version. I would appreciate if someone could analyze it. Looks like there is a light on the left side of the object. I have a similar pic of the area earlier of a Boeing 737 whcich you can easily make out that I can also send for comparison;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Cylinder shape made out of line lights in Tucson;2009-03-10 11:10:00;one hour;Cylinder shape made out of line lights in Tucson I looked up towards the Catalina Mountains in the Northeast at around 11:10 am.  I see a bright cylinder in the sky, between clouds.  I stare at it for a few seconds, then go find my camera. I come back and only find a giant cloud.  I wait a while, then I give up.  I look up again about ten minutes later, and it’s back in the blue sky.  I immediately start taking pictures. Not long after, it starts floating down towards another cloud.  It stays moving between the clouds, sometimes “bobbing”. A plane flies above it. I lose sight of it again, and put down my camera.  As I’m on the phone, I see it again in the blue sky. I try taking a few more pictures but only get 2 before it floats into more clouds.  I stare at it briefly before the clouds completely cover it.  Just like 2 months ago, the whole thing lasted about an hour, and it was roughly between  the two points the last ufo “floated” between.  Upon closer inspection of my photos, I realized it was a strange “capsule” shape, made up of 4 lines: dash, line, dash, line.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

I was trying to catch the sky. They clouds looked like living DNA webbing the sky and the sun was producing it. The crafts cloak with the clouds and only cameras seem to pick up their true form. I video recorded a silver cylinder shape UFO going up into the clouds. While small black round crafts almost like drones. There are white bird looking things that are light flying into the clouds.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
