Large metallic disc over central Tucson in thunderstorm.;1976-07-19 21:00:00;4 minutes;large metallic disc over central tucson in thunderstorm One night during a thunderstorm in july 1976, while watching lightning striking outside, thru the south side facing back door window of family house at age 8, I saw a very large (300+feet diameter) metallic disc floating stationary inside of the thunderstorm.   It had lights around outside bottom of disc, and 4 hemispherical protrusions, and bright bluish light in the center bottom. I was totally amazed to watch the lightning strike the craft several times, and noticed when the light reflected off the highly polished metallic surface.   I yelled for my mother, who came running, and we then watched the craft for about 3 or 4 minutes through the backdoor window.  Then it slowly moved upwards thru the clouds and vanished.  My father, who was retired from air force 3 years earlier, was told the story next day, and was very interested.  I remember parents talking about an article in the local newspaper the following day, where hundreds of people saw the same thing.   I have never been able to find article, but i know what I saw, and it was the real deal, an unforgetable experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Craft was spotted hovering over the city.;1996-12-31 18:30:00;15 minutes;A craft was spotted hovering over the city.  The in-laws and myself viewed the craft with the naked eye.  My father-in-law and I also viewed the craft through binoculars.  When the binocular adjustment was made blurry, you could see various lights rotating counter clockwise with a light spike at 4 o'clock.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Creature attempted to enter house.;1997-03-14 01:10:00;3-4 minutes;Creature attempted to enter house. This event occurred at about 1:10 AM on March 14, 1997, about 18 miles southwest of Tucson, Arzona.  At that time, I was a 42 year old electronic engineer. who operated a small home business, doing contract jobs for various clients.  I had lived in Tucson for some time, and felt that the city was too noisy for me to concentrate on my work.  I wanted to live in a quiet rural area where I would not be disturbed, and in 1996 I purchased a house in a sparsely populated area southwest of town. I had a neighbor across the road from me, and there was an unoccupied house furthur to the north.  My property extended about 100 feet from the front of the house, and then there was a barbed wire fence.  It had 5 wires, the top one being about 4 feet high.  It was usually quite dark at night out there, however I had installed some floodlights on the front of the house, which I could turn on if needed. I went to bed around 10 PM, March 13, and was sleeping soundly when the event began. I was awakened around 1:10 AM, March 14, by the sound of someone attempting to open the bedroom window, about 6 feet away from me.  The sound was like nails on a blackboard.  The window was on the front of the house, and consisted of double-pane glass with track-locks on it, and a set of blinds which were closed.  Although I could not see who was trying to get in, I had a profound feeling of being in danger... as if whoever was outside specifically intended to do something bad to me.  I've always had a good sensitivity to the feelings of people and animals, and I was confident that what I felt was genuine. As quickly as I could, I rolled out of bed, away from the direction of the window, and grabbed a 12 gauge shotgun from the closet.  At this time my emotions changed from fear to intense anger and a strong determination to kill the attempted intruder, if he got in.  I pumped a shell into the chamber, which made an audible noise, then ran to the living room window, which was only about 10 feet from the bedroom window, also on the front of the house.  That was where the switch for the floodlights was located. I hit the switch, and was totally shocked when I saw a creature, which was now moving away from the house towards the fence.  I got a pretty good look at the back of it, for about 5 seconds.  It was definitely not human.  It was about 6-7 feet tall and had a large head, similar in shape to a football helmet.  It was very thin and the arms were quite long.  It wasn't exactly running, but it was moving smoothly and very quickly. It reached the fence in just a few seconds, and then, without slowing down, it jumped right over it, like a hurdle jumper in the Olympics, and kept on going.  It continued down to the wooded area where the unoccupied house was, and within about 30 seconds I saw a disk shaped object rise up from there, and move off towards the south. It was about 30-40 feet in diameter and passed by the front of my house at a distance of about 130 feet, about 60-80 feet above the ground.  It had steady yellow-redish lights on the bottom of it and made no sound that I could hear. I mentally collapsed into a state of total shock and an overwhelming feeling of fear.  All I could think of was what might happen if it came back.  I spent the rest of the night hiding behind a couch in the living room, clutching the shotgun. When the sun began to come up, I started to come to my senses. I carefully went outside and looked around.  Everything seemed normal, except that by my bedroom window I found some footprints.  There hadn't been much rain and the ground was rather hard, but a few of the impressions were fairly clear.  The prints were about 10-11 inches in length, very thin, and with 3 large toes. I decided to go to a hardware store and get some bolt locks to secure the doors.  This I did, and on the way back I stopped at a small cafe a few miles from my house, to pick up some coffee and breakfast.  I entered the cafe, ordered some food, and then noticed that a casual friend of mine was there.  He lived in a trailer a few miles to the south of me.  When I saw him I simply said Man, something really weird happened last night, and he replied, You're not kidding... a UFO came up the canyon. I was startled to hear that, and asked him, What time? and he replied, about a quarter past 1.  When he said that, I panicked and left the cafe without even taking my coffee or food.  (Several months later I actually tried to find him, to ask him for more details, but I was told he had left the area back in March...immediately after the event had occurred.)   Anyway, I returned to the house, and installed the locks on the doors.  The following day I went into town and purchased a bunch of heavy plywood, and boarded up every window in the house. I considered reporting the incident, but I was doing some electronic design work for the military, and I was afraid that I might be typed as a lunatic or a security risk and lose my clearance... and in addition, I simply had no desire to talk about it.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Returning South from Picacho Peak on Interstate 10 eight miles north of Marana Az on the way returning to Tucson hovering over the city;2001-04-01 17:05:00;35 min;Returning South from Picacho Peak on Interstate 10 eight miles north of Marana Az on the way returning to Tucson hovering over the city I saw a craft that gave me a query in that it was 'static'. WE were passing under the Avra Valley over pass looking at this object that undisputably had no familiar confirmation as being a standard lighter than air-craft.  Marana was approx. 10 miles (35 north of Tucson).  As we got closer to Marana and allowing for my directional change of roadway we were made aware that it began moving (floating if you will)liesurely to the West and between Marana and the Tucson Mts. just west of I-10. As we approached the exit off I-10 into Marana (Greir Rd) I decided to exit to get a better view. We traveled west for 4 miles and met a dead end, exited our auto and watched it speeding up considerably and entered the distant cloud cover probably some fifty plus miles away.  The skies were cloudless over it's hover-location as well as Marana.  It's itinerary as I could discern that it traveled over the pencil of Tsn Mt's as they curved away from I-10 for about five miles.I wish to add that the confirmation of configuration is a typical saucer image with the dome over a concave/convex type body, exactly what has been drawn by others as well as the caricature craft we think of as being a 'flying saucer'.  My interest being always aware of skies (WWII Air Corps Pilot/Bombardier).Refering to having learned and never forgotten...keep your head up and your eyes moving my only other experience was in August 1965 in Elgin-St.Charles area (specifically Wayne,Il)having seen something in the dead of night bright non-manmade light that hung over hi-power trans-con power lines ala the EXETER INCIDENT I later learned that brought me into Ufology and a member of MUFON here in Tucson. May I add that this was my wife of 54 years first sighting and I know is a firmer believer in this phenomenon than she ever was.  ((name and address of MUFON member deleted))  The delay in this reporting id simply due! to now having this new Sprint Broadband. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I am a 4 year vetran of the army and my co-worker was a retired special forces major. I saw the craft just below the cloud deck which was at 9500 ft.  A winter storm was moving in and snow was forecast. This craft was hovering over a mountain range,in line-site of my position.I used the interstate to gauge it's size,and estimated it at over a mile and a half in lenght.It had sequential running lights that illuminated the clouds that were just above the immense craft.I have seen every known military plane,blimp,tanker,helicopter and stealth included.My esteemed colligue got a deathly white sheen to his face and would not come out of his personal jeep and quit 2 weeks later,no explanation.It re-appeared 2 more times in different location's but never too far from this gold mine it was hovering over.I,myself have seen more than i am writing about today,i just find it hard to belive that no one saw this gigantic craft making no bones about hiding,or playing hide and seek.Incidently,the next night,we were visited by 2 attack cobras who sat and watched us for god knows how long,until i cranked up the track hoe to feed the incinerator,and had to flick on the floods.As soon as i was aware of their presence,they circled our site several times,scanning us with a green laser light and i flicked my day-lighters in approval and the left at a high rate of speed going directly towards that gold mine.I have never seen attack helicopters fly in such miserable weather.My co-partner didn't want any mention of this to anyone,like it shook his very religious foundation,he was scared,i know scared and he was babbling like a child.ME,i turned the track hoe to face it and kept flicking my day-lighters in the hope they would come and see who was behind those lights.The back ground was a unique canvas,snow cloud white and a deck down to 9500 fett and the immense reflection from the circulating lights gave a crystal clear image of size,color and pure mavolence.I felt at ease,no panic.you see,i felt as these were friends,like we had met before.As i said earlier,i have many a tale to tell,maybe we can converse on another time,another report,maybe even meet some day.I am a regular guy,i have an associates degree in structural engineering and an advanced degree in heavy equipment operation.My name is barry,and you should be able to gleen my e-mail from this.Thank you sooooooooo much for reading my story.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Sabino Canyon Arizona UFO sighting April, 2004;2005-04-12 14:00:00;unknown;Sabino Canyon Arizona UFO sighting April, 2004 We were in Sabino Canyon on a tour in April 2004, and had just reached the end of the road and were preparing to head back. Before doing so, I was taking some pictures looking back the way we had just come. I didn't see anything unusual in the sky at the time I took this picture, nor did I notice these objects in the picture afterwards. A couple of months ago a friend was looking at my pics from the trip and asked me what the objects were in the upper part of the picture. I thought they were just birds, but when I zoomed in on them, we were surprised at what we saw! There appears to be 2 identical saucer-shaped objects, light grey with a darker underbelly, metallic (you can make out the sun reflecting off of them) one of the objects has what appears to be some sort of static-type discharge coming off of it. Unfortunately, I had the photo quality set to normal instead of superfine, so am unable to get more details than what you can see when you zoom in on the objects. These objects didn't show up in any other pictures before or after this one. Apparently my camera was the only witness to this sighting!

UFOs Caught on Videotape in Tucson Arizona August 5th 2008;2008-08-05 19:30:00;6 min 22 sec;UFOs Caught on Videotape in Tucson Arizona August 5th 2008 Report date:08/10/2008   Event Date:08/05/2008   I’m a videographer in Tucson Az.  On the evening of August 5th at approximately 19:30 a friend and I were videotaping an approaching storm the lightning was really going off. I often film these storms and go back through my footage to find cool still images of lightning. Today was just another day just another storm...so I thought. Later that evening I uploaded my video and started going through it for my shots. As I Scanned through the video something caught my eye flying across the top right corner of my screen. I watched this thing go by over and over and determined it moved to fast to be a bird or a plane, then I discovered that prior to seeing this object, something appears from a cloud in the middle of the screen and zig zags what appears to be into the distance then it shoots off with incredible speed and you here this sound like a ricochet. I decided I needed to go through this footage and see if I had captured any other activity. First I wanted to see what the thing was that was flying across the screen. I zoomed up on the image and it appears to be several (3-4) oval disc shaped objects flying together. I captured the still images for the evidence file. I started back at the begging of my footage to see if any other activity was present. Almost right away just after my camera was placed I discover 2 more UFOs. Both appeared in different locations on the screen at almost the same time. The first appeared about 100 yards away very quickly flies up from behind a large pine tree across the street and flips then descends and appears to go directly behind my buddies truck which we are positioned in front of. The other UFO appears way up in the clouds and is moving very fast through the clouds. As I scanned my footage further I discover another object moving very fast along the horizon real low. It enters from the right as it reaches the left side of the screen in moves in a very fast circular pattern upwards the disappears into the clouds. Further along in the footage an object is seen on the right side of the screen. It appears to be moving towards us the changes direction sharply and zig zags 2 times then flies quickly into the distance. I zoomed up on this to discover it was 3-4 disc shaped objects flying together. After this a few minutes later into the footage we encounter the first UFOs we talked about. One other strange thing appears. A red light appears on the windshield of my buddies truck. It has no reflection in the glass and is only visible for .02 of a second. When I zoom in and slowed the image down it looks very strange and has a pattern of movement. The Duration of the event less than 6 min 22 sec. My buddy and I saw nothing during the time we were videotaping only afterwards was anything discovered. This concludes my report.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Daylight disc seen in clear morning sky for and hour and a half.;2015-03-08 08:00:00;1.5 hours;Daylight disc  seen in clear morning sky for and hour and a half. My wife and I went out to have our coffee on our patio Sunday morning. I sat on a lounge chair under a Cabana frame with no top cover on it. I laid back at some point and noticed a large White spot in the Sky.  Time was about 08:00. It was cool about 70 degrees and only one wisp of a cloud in the sky near the object.  I thought it to be a weather balloon and noted where it was in relation to the frame of the cabana.  It was at ZENITH in the sky. I went in for a second cup of Joe and grabbed a pair of 7x50 binoculars to view that balloon.  Time then was about 08:15am and the object HAD NOT MOVED...  I adjusted the glasses (German) on a mountain top I knew was 5 miles from home, then I looked at the object...IT WAS A DISC!  My wife looked as well and thought she saw one wing stick out.  The DISC looked to be the size of a half dollar coin from this view with the field glasses. Silvery-white outer color and blue gray towards the center with a very BLACK center.  The view was crystal clear and no fuzzy images at all.  Still it had not moved from zenith. When I went for a third cup I grabbed my Nikon Coolpix electronic camera.  I had to step away from the frame so the auto focus would allow me to find that Disc.  At infinity the detail was 70% less than the field glasses but I was able to see a little bit of a ring like feature.  Looking again through the glasses I could see in detail a wedge forming in a dark color over the disc.  Thing changed details within the circle but only in color as far as we could tell.  Time was about 08:40am.  At this time I went back under the cabana frame to track any movement, It had moved about 2 degrees from Zenith towards the WEST.  I clicked off several photos and went inside to answered the telephone. With all this the wife and I were not sure that it wasn't a balloon and just Odd that it had not moved.  I PLANNED to call pilots' weather service, and get a Winds Aloft Report for southern Arizona...I failed to do so. At 09:15 I returned outside and it had not move but another 1 degree West. I went to my laptop and down loaded the photos and tried to enlarge them...UNTIL my laptop's security program had lapsed and (POP UPs) blocked everything I tried to do with the laptop.  I went outside and it was gone.  Time was 09:59I am not tech savvy with electronics and gave up for a while until tonight.  Almost 10 days now. I'll try to down load the photos I took.  Hope you all can enlarge them for your use.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

I was awake and sitting upright on a sofa.  I had my eyes closed.  Suddenly it appeared in the upper right field of my vision.  I saw a gray disk with a plate-like central part on the undersurface.  There was some type of inscription on this central part.  No running lights.   But, an orange aura slowly formed starting at the outer border of the UFO.  The orange aura slowly expanded for about six or seven seconds, held its position for a couple of seconds, then slowly regressed to the body of the UFO.   It repeated this orange aura expansion-regression process about ten times.   Then, the UFO disappeared.  My wife was nearby.  I described this occurrence to her as it was actually happening.  This is the only time I had this sighting.  I don't drink or take drugs.  My eyes were closed during this entire episode. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report describes himself as a retired military officer.

I narrated this one UFO phenomenon in real time to my wife as it was unfolding.  My wife says she has never experienced anything that might be considered preternatural.  I want to emphasize that in this UFO experience what I saw was a clearly-defined physical entity rather than the results of an eye pathology.  The object I viewed from the underneath vantage had some type of scribbling in its central circular area.  I have listened on Coast-to-Coast to your reports of physical sightings.  I was somewhat hesitant to send you my report because I saw the object with my eyes closed. Could it be that there is a psrapsychical dimension to my experience?  I'm open to all possibilities...even way-out bizarre ones.  Have you ever had anyone express to you anything like my experience?.... ((END ADDENDUM));32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

I was facing southeast (approx. 100 deg. magnetic) this glow was like a sundog. Approximate elevation of the cloud was 45 degrees. The sun was high in the south-southeast. The cloud was also the only “formed” cloud in the area of my vision. I was using a Canon Power-Shot SX620-HS I was zoomed at 25.65mm,f5.6 aperture at 1/500 of a second. After that shot, I zoomed out to 9.61mm and took a second photo from the same stance at f4.5 aperture at the same, photo data recorded 11:32AM and at a faster speed: 1/640 of a sec. I personally did not see the object when I took the photo! When I downloaded the camera there was the object. Then I looked at the second photo and there is no object. The area I was facing is toward the Davis-Monthan AF base (?)That object crossed my camera frame in less than a second.
