I passed the Tucson city limits, and as I approached town, I noticed many (5 to 7) lights in a V' formation.  The lights were very bright and large, a reddish white color, equidistance apart.  The tip of the V was the southernmost position.  I had difficulty discerning if these lights were part of one craft or separate ones.  I was not sure if the Tucson airport was south of I-10.   The lights seemed as though they were approaching and descending slightly, as they moved south.  I saw the sky between some points of light and noticed no other vehicles were pulling over or concerned, so I dismissed it as possibly aircraft, until I recently learned about other sightings on this date. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that both the time and date of the sighting are approximate.  However, we suspect she may have been witness to one of the craft seen over Phoenix, on the night of Thursday, March 13, 1997.  We have amended the time and date above, in order to reflect a sighting then.  PD));32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
As we traveled the 10e freeway to Tucson the cheveron shaped craft approahed us as if it was going to land on the highway;1997-08-29 22:00:00;20+ secs.;As we traveled the 10e freeway to Tucson the cheveron shaped craft approahed us as if it was going to land on the highway and when it got extremely close overhead, we got a pretty good look at it as it banked off to our right.  We were in a convertable and I don't recall any noise from the craft because there was a simi truck next to us braking.   It looked very similar to the sightings of March 13, 1997.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Chevron craft - 2 bright white/blue lights;2003-08-03 03:00:00;5 minutes;Chevron craft  - 2 bright white/blue lights My girlfriend And I were driving from San Diego to Dallas.  Some time between 1:00 am and 3:00 am, heading east on the 8 or the 10, west of Tucson, we observed what can be best described as 2 dancing lights on  the northeast horizon, perhaps a mile or so away, although it was difficult to tell. The lights were almost halogen like - a brilliant white blue.  It soon became clear these light were affixed to a craft, as they remained in the same relative position indicating they were affixed to a wing.  I remarked upon first sight that the maneuvers this craft was performing were not possible.  It would go from just hovering over ground level, and immediately climb, while spinning, to a couple thousand feet - almost like it was performing.  It then shot straight up and disappeared. About a minute later it reappeared directly in front of us, like two headlights.  It was traveling quite slowly, almost like a jetliner landing.  It was traveling west on the other side of the interstate at maybe 100 feet.  As it passed our lone car, its forward facing lights slowly rotated to point directly at the ground.  Its profile seemed negligable, almost like it was just a wing.  No sound.  After it passed our car and again acsended rapidly (like a few seconds) out of sight. At this point we were well freaked out and contemplating what to do. Maybe a minute later, I saw the same two lights in the rearview mirror following us east.  At this point my girlfriend started crying.  It slowly moved closer and again the lights rotated from a forward position to pointing at the ground.  It then once again rocketed away not to be seen again.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Strobing lights flashing in no particular pattern...lights would stop flashing completely for mere seconds at a time. Craft was made of a reflective material but not necessarily metallic. It appeared to jump a great distance instantaneously. The regular Tucson air traffic completely stopped all evening.after being rather busy just previously.

Stange Craft seen in  the night sky over Tucson Az.;2012-10-12 19:30:00;6 seconds;Stange Craft seen in  the night sky over Tucson Az. Wile looking up at the night sky I saw a V shaped object flying over head.  The Craft was headed eastward. It was a ghostly gray in color with four points of lighter shade of gray{two on each wing} evenly spaced along the wings of the craft at the third and two third points.   At first I thought it was a high flying B-52 but there was no fuselage and no sound.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
A soft white couple of opposing chevrons flew silently over.;2021-04-10 21:40:00;4-6 seconds;A soft white couple of opposing chevrons flew silently over. I am a sober middle aged man with glasses. I haven't been diagnosed with mental illness nor ever had a hallucination, to my knowlege. I was outside on my front porch which faces West when movement in the sky drew my attention.  I saw a soft white series of lights that looked more like reflections of moonlight than self luminous. There seemed to be two chevrons, one pointed forward and one pointed to the rear at a slight askew, upwards angle, with a distorted, perhaps reflective area between. It blocked out the stars and hazy high level clouds as it passed but some distorted lights seemed to be reflected in the area between the chevrons, which I assumed were reflected city lights.  It's size was slightly larger than a silver dollar held at arms length.  Within 4-6 seconds it passed from about 40 degrees to the Southwest to 45 degrees to the Northeast where it faded from sigh. It made no sound and there was no way to judge speed or size, other than getting an impression that it was larger than a private plane in size and much faster than any normal aircraft, but I cannot say with certainty.  There were no standard navigation or running lights and I am fairly familiar with aircraft. I am convinced this was something unusual.  This was over Tucson, between downtown and the University.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
