We chased Giant Gray Cubes through the desert near Tucson, AZ.;1989-05-10 11:00:00;20 minutes;We chased Giant Gray Cubes through the desert near Tucson, AZ. Looking northwest from downtown Tucson I saw two dark gray cubes, roughly the size of  small houses, at a height of approx. 400 feet, in loose formation, traveling horizontally toward the west northwest. My female friend  and I (male)(we were both students at the Univ. of Arizona at the time, living off campus), hopped on my motorcycle, a 1985 Honda 500cc Interceptor, and began pursuit, heading toward Phoenix on Interstate 10. I was riding in excess of 90 mph. They were out of site for several minutes, but became visible again once we cleared some hills south of Marana, AZ. They were 2 or three miles away toward the west..we took an offramp..Tangerine Rd..maybe..and continued high speed pursuit. They had decreased their altitude to about 100 feet above ground..i got within a quarter mile..they were dark gray..matte finish..no visible protrusions, holes, or lights..just plain gray cubes...traveling together..but moving independently,,bobbing up and down. They increased their speed to match ours apparently..never letting us get closer than about 1/4 mile. They settled over a rise in the road..and in the 12 to 15 seconds it took us to reach the rise they were no where in sight. I reported it to David Monthan AFB...after playing phone tag for 30 minutes,,mostly on hold, they told me that the giant cubes we saw were marker ribbons dropped by the Air Force.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

We were in the living room waiting for my mom to open her mothers day presents and we heard the dogs outside barking crazily. I got up said I would check it out and went out side thinking it might be an animal, I went out and didn't see anything at first, then I looked up because I liked looking at the night sky and I saw this craft. It was long, with a larger back end with the front being flat,  and had some lights coming off of it and it was moving slowly eastward and it was dead silent and right above my head. The craft was low enough that if it went over the house I could have reach up and touched it standing on the roof of our 1 story house. I screamed and yelled for my parents to come out it was a ufo next thing I know they are at the door holding my younger sibling watching it to. Then we went back inside and just tried to make seance of what we had just seen.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Anyway we noticed a darting object and my friend said/asked if we saw that? We agreed. We layed down on the ground and watched literally 100's (trying not to exaggerate), objects flying in and out of this star? Whatever, it was a Mother Craaft we don't know but we watched for a long time. It was wild. These objects had no spitting out like and explosion. They DARTED  in out up down. There was no rythme . Just as if they were going in and out of a gas station. I cannot remember the year but my friend can exactly cuz her b-day was coming up.

I did not see any material object but just lights and the outline or formation of a huge area of the westwern shy. If it was not for the semicircular formation I could have easily mistaken it for just an atmospheric phenomena that caused a number of brilliant twinkling lights.

daytime white \grey shaded irregular object. floating  then gone approx. 30 -60 feet in size.;2000-06-11 17:30:00;20 min;daytime white \grey shaded irregular object. floating  then gone approx. 30 -60 feet in size. While visiting friends in the northwest part of town my wife and her friends husband observed a white and grey object floating in the clear sky during the day (temperature was approx 100 degrees). Mention was made of it and I went out and still found it in the sky but located approximately 3 feet (held at arms length) north of original position which was just next to the moon in the eastern sky. My view was looking north with Mt. Lemmon in the background (a 9,000 ft mt.)and up at about a 45 degree angle in the sky. Object was moving further away in height and distance from my vantage point. Binoculars revealed an odd shaped object much like a balloon but not round at all. Rough estimates of the shape are difficult but it was not aerodynamic in nature. My thoughts were like a balloon that they attach to car lots of a gorilla etc. Maybe this floated away. The only problem with this theory is that it was not a recognizable shape except for a rectangular portion at one end and 2 pieces sticking out from it to another irregular mass. Object made no noise, shape changed as you watched and was estimated at between 2000-3000 feet high and rising somewhat. Object moved slowly and had strange grey shadowing on white, no other color (such as advertising balloons would have). Upon looking at object for some 10 min. I went inside and returned to have another look about 2 min. later. Object had disappeared. This is what caused me to report the incident. Being in the aviation field and familiar with aircraft types I would have to say it possibly was a balloon except that through the use of logic and common understanding of gravity I cannot see how an object of approx. 30-60 feet in size(estimated) could have deflated and fallen out of the sky in such a short time period .I believe the object could have been a balloon but it gave chills to view from binoculars as it was a very odd shape and in the sunlight you could see a grey mist around the object as you viewed it,perhaps an occular trick due to binocular magnific! ation an d the eye straining to understand what was being viewed. I still do not know what it was but it was the topic of conversation at our dinner that night.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

((NUFORC Note:  Likely sighting of Sirius.  PD))  Moving star-like objects and Red Flashing Lights.;2005-05-30 20:00:00;2 hours;Moving star-like objects and Red Flashing Lights My husband called me outside to see a light that was hovering and changing colors in the northwestern sky.  We called our children (ages 12 and 10) outside to view the light. We brought out our binoculars to get a better view. While I was looking through the binculars, my son (12)saw a red streak go down to the right of the object and screamed Did you see that?. I didn't, but when we searched for the first light that was chaning colors it had disappeared.  We continued to look up at the sky. We saw two star-like objects move together from left to right in the north western sky and then they disappeared. Then there were two star-like objects in the northeastern sky that would appear and disappear in slightly different areas than they were before, but their distance from each other remained the same.  Then we saw a star like object move over head from north to south. It passed another starlike object and made an immediate turn back and joined with the object it had just passed. It appeared to form a tiangle with two other star-like items.  Finally, we saw three red flashing lights go across the sky from the south east part of town over to the northwest part of town. Using binoculars we tracked it as it went across the sky. The three red lights flashed randomly in a triangle formation. There was absolutely no sound coming from the object. Shortly after it had passed an airplace passed in the distance and it could clearly be heard!  It was an exciting two hours we spent looking up at the sky!  We also saw several shooting stars through out the night. We hope others in the Tucson area saw the same thing! ((NUFORC Note:  Likely sighting of Sirius.  PD));32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

A close view from Tucson, AZ;2006-11-08 04:50:00;5 min.;A close view from Tucson, AZ On the morning of the 8th of November I was outside in the early hours of the morning on my back patio having a cigarette with my girlfriend. I was just about to put it out and go inside when she yelled to me and pointed to the north eastern part of the sky. To my amazement I saw what first appeared to be a helicopter but in the seconds there after it was undeniable that this was nothing that I had ever seen before. At first it was an incredibly bright light as if pointing in our direction with a hint of red light with it. The thing I noticed right away was that there was no sound what so ever coming from this thing in the sky. As we watched we saw it grow larger as it came closer and more detail into our line of sight. While it was on the horizon approaching us, it appeared to be the classic saucer shaped object. As it got closer, I could see that it was actually in the shape of a triangle(when viewed from underneath) with rounded edges.  When compared with the size of a large, full moon, it would have been slightly smaller in the sky about 95% of the time we viewed it, except the short time it went almost directly over top of where we were.  It didn't go directly over top of us, however it was very close and as it went over top of us I could see that there was something protruding from the center of the underbelly that had a red light that was in the shape of a sphere. At this point I could tell that it was between eighty five and a hundred and ten feet in the air. The whole time it did not make a sound and the interesting thing that I noticed was that it seemed like every coyotye in ear shot was howling seemingly at whatever we were witnessing. There were other lights around the edges of the craft and they seemed to be a bright white. As we watched it, I saw that it seemed to be going straight up and down five to ten feet in short, quick spurts or jerks similiar to seeing a piece of metal bouncing or being pushed around between two magnets.  After noticing this I was suddenly struck with absolute terror, as it suddenly became clear to me that compared to this, I was nothing more than an ant, to possibly be stepped on at any moment.  At this point my girlfriend and I were so frightened and overwhelmed that we ran into the house and after a few panicky moments decided to wake my mother.  Soon the three of us were outside attempting to find this thing in the sky again, and to my surprise, in that short period of time, the object had suddenly switched to the opposite corner of the sky(southwest) though still very visible.  We watched it float towards the southwest for anothr minute or two until all of a sudden it just disappeared as if someone flipped a light switch.  That was the last we saw of the object.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

She was pointing up and when i looked i saw something in the sky.  It made ABSOLUTELY no sound what so ever it just kind of hovered slowly in the air..   it had a red light on the underbelly that was attached to a piece that was protruding towards the ground from the center of the underbelly.  There were also bright lights around the edges of the craft.  It appeared to be a triagular shaped object however it also resembled a saucer or as my mother put it A ferris wheel on its side. After noticing that it was moving toward our direction and that it was almost directly above us at this point, we were so scared that we ran into the house and woke up my mother after a minute of freaking out.  She got out of bed and saw this thing as well.  I would love to speak to someone about this.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Witnessed 6-7 blinking crafts for the second day in a row.;2009-06-03 17:30:00;10 min;Witnessed 6-7 blinking crafts for the second day in a row. UFO Sighting in Tucson, AZ #2:  I was standing in my backyard with my mother, watering the plants like the case in my last report, when we saw a strange balloon-like object flying 5-6 miles away. It was large, and colorful, and seemed normal, except that it was in the area where airplanes fly. There was a helicopter that was moving in its general direction, and the balloon began to change altitude, moving lower towards the Foothills. I decided it was simply a normal set of stray balloons, but my mother was a little more suspicious, and decided to keep monitoring it. I went to keep watering the plants, when I returned my mother said that the balloon type thing had disappeared into thin air. I found this very strange and failed to locate it myself. 3-4 minutes later, I spotted similar, if not the same, craft(s) as the day before. They were 30-40 miles away above the Catalina Mountains. They had a blinking that was visible even from that height. They stayed fairly immobile compared to the day before. There were more than last time, and they actually made several shapes. Several times, they formed a rhombus, an arrow pointing right, and various other formations that I could not understand. They seemed to be at a very high altitude, being at maybe 10,000-20,000 feet. After 4-5 minutes, 2 or 3 of the crafts descended and were maybe 4000-5000 feet directly above my area. They moved at a speed that was beyond anything I’ve ever seen before. I have seen similar UFO’s two days in a row. I believe this is not a coincidence. They might be monitoring humans, or giving a personal message, or they could be military devices that haven’t been exposed to the public. Well, I’m not giving this report to tell you my opinion.

I didn't pay much attention to it because the nearby air force base's flight path is right over my house  What did catch my eye is a object,white or bash with either a ensignia or a dark window on the side middle of the craft.  It was in front of the 2 chinooks going west too but what was odd is the shape(square),  it made no sound,and it skipped through the air.  I mean it did a stop,go,stop,go,stop,go in the air but did it really fast but slow enough for me to see it was stopping and going.  Well the object and the 2 chinooks went west tillthe 2 chinnoks went right to go to ryan air field and the object proceeded to go west.I forget to mention that the square object omitted no light whatsoever in or around the craft.

White lights seen at night to the north of Sabino Canyon.;2013-11-27 19:30:00;5 minutes;White lights seen at night to the north of Sabino Canyon At approximately 18:00 on the evening of 11/27/13 my friend, G*** and I walked a little over 1 mile up the paved tram road in Sabino Canyon which enters up into the Catalina Mountains on the very north east side of Tucson, Az.  We set up a couple of camping chairs on the edge of the road so that we could look at the night sky to the north east and have a conversation. At about 19:30 I turned my gaze to the north and saw a white light in the sky at about 10:00 above the horizon.  The light was moving slowly from north to south and appeared to be both below and in some clouds that peppered the otherwise clear sky.  The light was soft white with no blinking running lights and did not have the bright glare of an airplane headlight.  It looked similar to a satellite but was about 3 to 5 times larger.  There was no sound. If one were to hold their arm out and spread their fingers to about 4 inches, that would be the distance this object travelled.  It then faded out at the end and disappeared.  From our vantage point this object was moving more towards us than away. A couple of minutes later I looked at the same location and saw a light that looked exactly the same but this time it was headed at a 90 degree angle from where the first one was seen to fade out and this one went about the same distance from east to west and faded out as well. At about 20:00 my attention again was drawn to this location in the sky and another white light was moving very slowly from east to west again seeming to be in the clouds and not above them.  This one was seen for a longer duration of 3 minutes where the others were viewed for just under a minute each.  This 3rd light disappeared into the clouds and my friend G*** said it should be coming out of the clouds at a break in them at any moment.  We never saw the object again even though its trajectory should have had it come out at a good sized piece of cloudless sky. The next night (Thanksgiving) our local channel 4 TV station aired a report about strange lights over Tucson on 11/28.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Fast moving straight line from E to W, no sound, completely covered underneath with dim white light.;2016-10-27 20:00:00;6 seconds;Fast moving straight line from east to west, no sound, completely covered underneath with dim white light, slower that a meteor, much faster than an aircraft or satellite,  I looked up and caught it at 45 degree above the east horizon and watched it move into the clouds closer to Tucson.  Considering the elevation of the cloud base and a craft disappearing into the clouds I would have to say that it was much larger than any craft I have ever seen over Tucson.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Shape-shifting pod with moving appendages gave many different looks in 35 minutes. NW Tucson, AZ.;2016-12-16 11:30:00;35 minutes;Shape-shifting pod with moving appendages gave many different looks in 35 minutes. NW Tucson, AZ. I was out in my back yard doing yard work at about 11:30am on 12/18/16. A reflection from the west at approximately 5-10 thousand feet (only an estimate, of course) caught my attention. When I focused on it, I could see that there was something that was metallic and rotating clockwise in a slow, stable, and consistent manner. It gave the impression of being something heavy (not a balloon), if that makes sense.  There was no noise at all.  We got a lot of military and commercial air traffic over this location: helicopters and all manner of planes.  We even saw the Goodyear blimp from this location  several times while we lived there, but this sighting was unique.  I had my phone and tried to take a picture, but the object was too high up for me to get a good shot. I ran inside and got my SLR camera (Nikon D60), quickly changed lenses to my telephoto lens, and ran back outside, thinking that the object might be gone by this point. It was still there, so I started taking pictures.  The object appeared and then disappeared from my view based upon how it was reflecting the sunlight. Since it seemed to be several miles away, I had a hard time focusing my camera on it, but I was able to get quite a few good shots. The object’s appearance changed many times while I was taking pictures.  It was very confusing, to be honest.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  Finally, it appeared to change shapes into something that looked like a small, white plane that circled the area where the sighting occurred.  Finally, that “plane” flew off to the north and seemed to morph into a larger white plane that headed east along a typical (for that area) commercial flight line.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Four strobing lights seen in motion moving from the south to the west in Tucson, AZ with military activity present;2017-02-07 21:30:00;2-5 minutes;Four strobing lights seen in motion moving from the south to the west in Tucson, AZ with military activity present While watching television at home, my two roommates and I heard jets outside.  This is a normal occurrence due to Davis Monthan Air Force Base being located here however, tonight the noise was excessive and unsettling. We went outside because we were sure what we heard was a rocket or something, but the source of the noise was in fact several military jets.  They were circling the area and when looking to the south, 4 bright bluish lights, slightly larger than the stars but smaller than Venus, were moving in a westward direction.  The jets appeared to be either observing or chasing the object or objects. While there were four visible lights, they moved in unison, indicating that the lights were part of a single large craft.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

We were waiting in a gas line at Costco in Tucson when we noticed the man in front of us taking pictures of the sky where the daytime moon was located.  Upon exiting our car, we also looked up and saw 3 stationary objects in the area of the moon.  They looked silver as a plane would with the sun reflecting off the objects.   A minute later we looked up again and saw more had joined the group for a total of maybe 8 and all still stationary.  When we looked up minute or so later, they were gone.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Some friends and I had just arrived home after being out for a while and when I parked the car in my driveway, one of my friends noticed a strange object in the sky that seemed to be moving. It was almost like looking at a straight line of lights moving silently across the sky. It disappeared after about 4 or 5 minutes.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

As i glanced to my left looking North at eye level a very bright object very high in the night sky caught my attention upwards. It was headed East away from the city running parrallel to I-10 towards El Paso. The object's entire underside was glowing a very bright bluish green. The shape was part rounded square at back end and almost pickle fork at the front end. It was so high that the glow of the object reflected into the cloud cover which i couldn't in the night sky see except where the objects glow was cast. There was no wings no blinking lights no track lights.  It was traveling extremely fast and after about 4 or 5 seconds it ubruptly turned straight upward and shot into the clouds above disappearing completely. It might be worth noting that a friend that lives in Rita Ranch that i relayed my sighting to immediately says The trains by house i have noticed lately run during the middle of the night. Last night at 02:15 i woke up to train after train pulling in and pulling out.  It hws me curious but for some reason i think it has to do with what you saw I also felt he might be right that the military is moving live beings or objects in and out of Davis Montham Airforce base in the middle of the night......;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Then we both noticed a small object zigzagging angled up towards the sky and then angled down.  It was a boomerang shape.  We could not track it with the telescope but I did with my phone and took a photo of it.  We are only a few miles from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.  The object was closer to the Catalina mountains.  The Craft was illuminated White when photographed and seemed to be glowing.  The boomerang shape was even noticeable from the naked eye.   If needed, I have photos that clearly show craft.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
