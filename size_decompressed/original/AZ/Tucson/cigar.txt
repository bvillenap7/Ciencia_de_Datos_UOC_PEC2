Object seen over Tucson Mountains possible missile launch?;2007-03-31 18:15:00;1 to 2 minutes;Object seen over Tucson Mountains possible missile launch? I think what I saw was a missile launch, but if that is indeed what I saw, then this is the first time I have ever seen the actual missile flying through the air. I first saw a vertical wavy smoke trail above the mountains to the Southeast of Tucson, and at the top of the trail, I saw a cigar shaped object flying upwards. The smoke dissipated, and the object leveled off and flew a straight horizontal path parallel to the mountains, and probably somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 feet. I was stopped at a red light in my car when I saw this and I was able to follow the tiny distant object for about a minute before I had to concentrate more on the road in front of me. Once I looked away, I wasn't able to locate the object again.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Cigar shaped UFO spotted in Tucson, AZ on May 14, 2011.;2011-05-14 12:30:00;about 2 minutes;Cigar shaped UFO spotted in Tucson, AZ on May 14, 2011. It was Saturday, May 14th, 2011 around 12:30pm. I was in the back seat, right side, of my friends’ car travelling west on E. Speedway Boulevard, Tucson, AZ.  I believe I first spotted it near the intersection w/ Craycroft.  I saw one silvery-golden cylindrical metal craft that was shaped like a cigar or a cigarette ( long and thin).  It was flying in the same direction as we were travelling (westward) in the sky north of us. It was flying fast.  It was not all that high in the sky which made me think it was taking off or landing.  It was flying fairly level so it didn't appear to have just taken off or preparing for landing.  It appeared to have a thin stripe of an orange metallic color at the front and another thin orange stripe in the center.  There were no wings and we didn’t her any plane noises.  I pointed it out to my friend who was in the front passenger seat and she also saw it.  I don’t know if the driver saw it.  We watched it for a few blocks then it was ou! t of our view.  My friend and I are college counselors.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
