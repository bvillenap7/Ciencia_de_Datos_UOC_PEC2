A cone shaped object slowed down 400 feet next to the left side of my truck. After about 10-15 seconds two more objects came down besides truck. The first cone shape object to appear came down through the clouds with fire and smoke rings coming off of it.  It then descended to about 400 feet above the ground next to the left hand side of my truck.  The first object then stopped where it then nosed-up to a 45 degree angle and then proceded to descend backwards.  Then the other 2 objects appeared in the same manner as the first, where then the first object began to move forward.  The first cone shaped object was about 1/2 mile ahead of the other two, where the back end of the first object was visible. This tail end of the first object was glowing red hot, such as the brightness and detailed color of a sunrise.  The second and the third cone shaped objects were flying side by side with one just above the other.  All three objects ignored traffic on the highway and the traffic on the highway ignored them.  The first one turned up at a 45 degree angle and turned left away from the highway.  It then accerlatered from the highway with a high rate of speed..  The other two objects did the same thing as the first one.  They were all redish brown in color, no windows, no wings, no markings, no sound, and they looked brand new.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
