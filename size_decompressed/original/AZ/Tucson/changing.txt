BRIGHT ORANGE/YELLOW OBJECT FILMED AT SUNSET IN WESTERN SKY;2004-09-14 18:30:00;2-3 MINUTES;BRIGHT ORANGE/YELLOW OBJECT FILMED AT SUNSET IN WESTERN SKY THE OBJECT WAS FILMED IN THE WESTERN SKY AT SUNSET (6:30PM), FROM MY BACK PORCH IN TUCSON, ARIZONA ON TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 14TH, 2004. IT WAS FILMED USING MY SONY DIGITAL HANDYCAM, DIGITAL 8 WITH 450X DIGITAL ZOOM. UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT A TRIPOD, BUT I WAS SITTING ON A CHAIR AND I HAD THE CAMERA ON MY LAP. ANYWAY, I WENT OUTSIDE TO WATCH THE SUNSET (AND SKYWATCH). I FELT THE URGE THAT I SHOULD BE VIDEOTAPING. AS SOON AS I STARTED RECORDING, I NOTICED A BRIGHT ORANGE/YELLOW OBJECT THROUGH THE SCREEN OF MY CAMERA. I LOOKED UP TO LOCATE THE OBJECT WITH MY EYES BUT WAS UNABLE TO SEE IT. I CONTINUED RECORDING THE OBJECT FOR A FEW MINUTES. DURING THAT TIME I WAS ABLE TO ZOOM IN ON THE OBJECT SEVERAL TIMES. FROM A DISTANCE IT JUST LOOKED LIKE A ROUND, BRIGHT ORANGE/YELLOW LIGHT. WHICH HAD TO BE VERY BRIGHT CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS SUNSET AND THE WHOLE SKY WAS ORANGE AND YELLOW. ONCE I ZOOMED IN ON THE OBJECT IT NO LONGER LOOKED ROUND BUT SEEMED TO CONTINUALLY BE CHANGING SHAPE. IN THE CENTER OF THE OBJECT IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT WITH YELLOW, ORANGE AND RED EMITTING ALL AROUND IT. IN SOME FRAMES YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE BLACK OR DARK AREAS. IT'S DEFINITELY HARD TO DESCRIBE. FOR THE FIRST COUPLE MINUTES IT JUST SEEMED TO DART AROUND AND THEN IN THE LAST MINUTE OR SO IT GOT LOWER AND LOWER IN THE SKY AND ALSO NO LONGER WAS BRIGHT. IT BECAME SORT OF NEUTRAL IN COLOR AND VERY HARD TO SEE. THEN IT WAS JUST GONE. THIS ALL HAPPENED PRETTY QUICKLY. I THINK THE TOTAL FILMING TIME WAS AROUND 3 MINUTES. I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND THE CORD THAT HOOKS THE CAMERA TO THE COMPUTER, SO I CAN'T SEND YOU THE VIDEO YET. BUT I HAVE TAKEN A BUNCH OF STILL SHOTS FROM THE VIDEO SO THAT AT LEAST THERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN LOOK AT NOW. I AM EMAILING YOU A FEW OF THEM. IF YOU WANT ANY MORE OR NEED ANYTHING ELSE, JUST LET ME KNOW.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
colored lights over the mountains around Tucson;2006-06-20 21:30:00;3-4 min;colored lights over the mountains around Tucson I am an RN.  I am not a UFO watcher.  I have never seen one but on this night my grandson and I were outside while I smoked.  We were looking to the west over the Tucson mtns. He noticed a bright yellow object moving slowly over the Tucson Mtns skyline . He called my attention to the object and as we watched it travel it began to change colors.It went from white to bright orange and from a flat disk shape to an elongated cigar shape. As it glowed brighter it began to move much faster and changed direction to the due east. As it neared us we noted it made NO sound.It began to move over the Catalina mountains and 2 jets from Davis -Monthan air base began to give chase after it. The object changed colors again from orange to white on top and red below.It got much closer as it again changed direction and headed south.The jets were not able to keep up with it.The object sped soouth and suddenly shot out of sight.This lasted 1-2 minutes.We kept looking over the mountains and talking about what we had just seen and the object returned .It was to the north over the Catalinas. It was still two colors,silent,cigar shaped and traveling at a high rate of speed.It was moving from west to east .Again jets gave chase.This time 3 planes went up.! plane was below it and two were climbing.They were not able to near the object at all. It changed directions again and headed straight up.It was gone in seconds. The entire incident lasted 3-4 minutes. By it's very nature it was an unidentified flying object.

THe object was pursued by F-14s from the nearby airbase;2006-07-11 20:30:00;4-5 min;THe object was pursued by F-14s from the nearby airbase My grandson and I were outside and he was chatting while I watered.I was watching lightening to the west and noticed an odd aircraft.It was oblong in shape,the size of ,or a bit larger than an f-14.It was traveling west by northwest and made no sound. I called my grandsons attention to it and we now watched it earnestly.I was so absorbed I didn't even think of the camera. The object had a dim white outline of lights.It did not have the usual strobes and green/red flashers of conventional aircraft. Since it was silent and unconvential I was now getting pretty excited and so was my grandson. The object continued northwest and began to fly low over the Catalina Mountains.(highest peak around 9,000 ft) As it traveled it began to pickup speed and suddenly it was joined by an F-14 out of Davis Monthan airbase.It appeared to be in pursuit of the craft.The craft began to glow orange,started heading south and 2 more jets scrambled out of the base after it. The object turned blue,changed to a large triangle shape and shot upward. The F-14s stayed with it on its tail and both sides. It then began a sharp fast climb and in a few seconds it left the fighters and was gone. I am now a beleiver in UFO's as this was truly an unidentified flying object. I find I am always watching the skies now.I am a retired nurse.I have 2 degrees in the sciences.I am 50 yrs old.I have never been a believer but am an avid weather watcher and so I look at the sky often.I have seen other odd objects in the sky but until now I could always find a rational explanation.Not for this.Not for this.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Fast and silent, bright and bewildering;2006-07-19 21:24:00;00:39;Fast and silent, bright and bewildering The object appeared in the west as a sudden ball of growing orange light. Suddenly the orange light flashed yellow and a craft appeared in its place. the object proceeded to the west and changed course to the south sharply and had no sound. The object was less than a half of a mile away and was only about 1500ft overhead. Having served in the United States Navy of a period of years in Virginia and being exposed to many military aircraft, as well as having many years of experience as a amature astronomer, I had never witnessed any thing such as this. I was quick enough to grab my friend's cell phone and recorded 37 seconds of video. I have watched the clip over and over, converting the file into different formats and I do not know what to think of it. I have included and original copy of the .3gp for your use.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

I noticed this object  plane  wasn't moving and started watching it because it was so bright. The object had bright white lights, and also had red and blue lights.  The object stayed in the NW sky, but I saw it move sideways, not like a plane.  I ran in the house and got my camera and took some pictures.  The object stayed in approximately the same place for an hour or so.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Golden triangular object reshaping into golden half moon or dome before disappearing.;2007-09-11 09:00:00;20-30 seconds;Golden triangular object reshaping into golden half moon or dome before disappearing. My Wolfie and I like to hike the desert together in the mornings before it gets too hot.  We were hiking in the area near Old Tucson Studios with Golden Gate Mountain in the background. Approximately 9:00 a.m. September 11, 2007 a golden triangular object hovered west of Tucson, Arizona over the Tucson Mountains between Golden Gate Mountain and Old Tucson Studios.  The object was as big as a dime with arm extended, on a clear day with few clouds. The clouds closest to the golden triangular object were most brilliant and vivid compared to the other clouds furthest away from it. There appeared to be a dome in the center of the golden triangular object with the sun’s shadow visible on one side.  Also the triangle reshaped into a golden half moon or dome before vanishing into thin air. Image of the golden triangular object was captured on digital camera and printed on 8x10 enlargement glossy Fuji photo paper at a local Walgreens by my friend, a Tucsonian, who immediately recognized it as a UFO.  And there was a 2 for $5.00 sale on the 8x10’s.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Changing shape low in Davis-Mothan AFB landing pattern.;2008-06-07 01:00:00;5 mins;Changing shape low in Davis-Mothan AFB landing pattern. On Friday night 6/6/08 about 12:30 to 1:00am I noticed what appeared to be balloons flying in the air as if they had broken free from say a car dealer lot. This was a huge string of balloons however as I watched I noticed it had the ability to fly in formation, so I thought maybe it was a flock of birds, but then I realized that it was to late and no birds fly this late. I started watching more closely trying to figure out what I thought I was seeing. Whatever this was it had the ability to fade in and out of sight meaning one second I could see pieces and the next second it was as if it had totally disappeared and then the next second it was visible again. It started off as a straight line then as it moved east to west it changed to a semicircle with the open end facing east. It disappeared the reappeared in a v shape I noticed it was banking to the south. Thats when I could see what looked like a dome shape within the v shape I could only see part of it. The other strange part we live close to an air force base, so I am familiar with different types of aircraft as well as the landing patterns whatever this was it was actually flying lower than the standard helicopter pattern also no engine noise. I have no idea what this actually was, but I can tell you that it was not technology that we are aware of. In truth I have no clue as to what this was in the end I got scared and went inside my home. I checked the wind direction for that night it was out of the wsw 5 to 8 knts.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Bright multi-colored cigar shaped object that moved too quickly and erratically to be a jet.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star.  PD));2008-10-18 20:30:00;30 min. but still there;Bright multi-colored cigar shaped object that moved too quickly and erratically to be a jet. I was sitting in my back porch facing North.  I noticed a bright star moving erratically at about 2 o'clock.  It moved up, down, and in zig-zag patterns.  It moved fast.  It appeared to be red at first.  My neighbor brought his binoculars and we could see that the object was many different colors.  It appeared to be about 15,000 to 20,000 from the earth.  It also appeared to change shape but mostly it was cigar shaped.  I contacted the Air Force and they took my information.  As I am writing this, the object appears smaller.

I was in the driver's seat of my car in a parking lot looking at the driver's side mirror, when I saw an object moving towards the east of south Tucson.   Then, it returned to the west, and changed shapes before my eyes. First it was like a bird flying slowly.  Then it went behind a tree for a second and re-emerged out in the open air space again.  And that is when I saw it was in another shape.  It looked like a bell shaped, brownish object.   Then it disappeared.

Orbs/ discs coming from the direction of the sun. Appearing and reappearing in different locations.  Only visible with binoculars.  They seem to emitted silk looking strings.  They seem to fly erratic like, pausing often.  Flickering, and changing shapes.  They fly in and disappear over particular areas.  There are so many of them, I stopped trying to count.  It has been going on since the eclipse.  That's the day I noticed.  When clouds get near, they seem to leave.

They appeared again a few seconds later miles away to the south for about 5-10 seconds more and then disappeared again.  Traveling much faster than aircraft seen in the same area of the sky.   These square like lights were much bigger than any known aircraft we have.  There were multiple square like lights at least 5-10 maybe more.
