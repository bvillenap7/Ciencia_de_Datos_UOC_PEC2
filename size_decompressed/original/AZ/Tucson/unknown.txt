Paired blue halos ascend rapidly and silently.;1986-09-20 23:50:00;10-20 sec;Paired blue halos ascend rapidly and silently. This small event occured whilst I was riding my bicycle home from work late one night around midnight. We lived in the foothills of the Santa Catalina mountains of Tucson, along the southwest slope. I was coming through the trees between two houses to get to my back yard, when I looked up toward our house. The mountains can be seen directly over our roof from that position, about 3-4 miles away. Above the house, but between me and the mountainside were two blue halo-shaped phenomena that rose from about 20 degrees, straight up to about 75 or 80 degrees before winking/fading out. The closest comparison I can come up with is that of the paired exhaust ports on an F-4 Phantom. Two blue flame-like halos trailing to cones as they ascended. They were much larger than jet exhaust ports in scale though, from that distance. They rose above the level of the mountains, from my perspective, and still all I could see were the halos. No shape blocked out the stars where one would think a fuselage would have been. There was no sound whatsoever, and we were very used to the sounds of military aircraft, as Davis Monthan AFB in town is one of the largest AF bases in the SW. This was no jet. There are no swamps in Tucson to produce swamp gas. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Weird Light Beam;1998-06-19 16:00:00;10 seconds;Weird Light Beam I dont know, if this was an alien sighting, or if it even counts as one, but it's something I experienced several years ago, and just shrugged it off, not thinking that I could be involved in something like this.  It happened during the summer, about 7 or 8 years ago, and my cousins and I were bored and so we decided to go see a movie. But before we left, I had to finish up a load of laundry.  Now, our house is the middle house in a cul-de-sac, so when we open our garage door, it faces the cul-de-sac and the street that leads into it. Our washing machine and and dryer are in there, and so when we do the wash, we can see the outside world.  After putting the clothes in the washer I opened the door to the house, to go back inside. The door, is the kind, that when open, it automatically shuts close, real fast. Well, I opened the door, and all of a sudden, my entire garage is flooded in a bright neon lime-green light.  I turn around and see that the entire neighborhood is flooded in this light. Everywhere I looked, everything was covered in this light, as if someone was holding a light, right over our cul-de-sac. I didnt see any object, but after about 10 seconds, of being in light, this huge shadow came out of nowhere and then flew off to the western sky. And then there was this weird wind (like a suction)and the trees blew along with other debri, to the west and then stopped.  The light flew off too, and everything turned back to normal. I turned around and started to walk back in the house. Now, all this time, the door has been opened. And if you recall, I told you that it was one of those sprung doors, that shut as quickly as it opened. Well, right then and there, the door shut, right over my left foot, ripping up my nail on my big toe.  The Dr. said, the nail would never grow back, because the nerves had been lifted out, but it did, and to this day, my toe has a nail. Something, my Dr. said was a miracle.  I dont know what it was that happened that day, but I always thought, that it had something to do with an alien. So, I was wondering if you can shed some sort of information on this, and tell me, if you have another experience such as this, recorded. Thanks.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Pair of objects flying side by side.;1998-08-31 22:00:00;60 seconds;Pair of objects flying side by side. My son (10 years old) and I were driving to our hotel in Tucson after dinner out with some friends.   We saw two objects flying toward us from the SW (moving NE).  Objects were side by side with a single light on either end (?) front & back.   Moving slowly toward us, they came to a stop and one of the objects just sort of pivoted it's front end out to the side, heading E and started moving again.  The second object did the same and they continued one behind the other to the E.  We stopped the car when we first saw them because they looked so strange and we were on a secluded dirt road.  There was no noticeable engine noise.   My son and I live very near an active MCAS in So Cal and we are very accustomed to seeing military craft.  We have also been to Tucson several dozen times in the last few years and we have become very familiar with the military aircraft at the Davis-Monthan Air Station in Tucson.  My son can identify most any military jet with only a slight glance - he loves them!  But these had him stumped and spooked.  We watched them for about a minute as they disappeared off into the eastern sky.  The way they turned was not at all like any aircraft we have observed.  There was no banking involved.  They just stopped and one of them slid out to the side, started moving E and the other followed with exactly the same kind of pivoting turn.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
A possible jet contrail ot other.;1999-02-10 18:45:00;5 Min;A possible jet contrail ot other. At approx. 18:45 hrs, Feb 10, 1999. A co-worker and I noticed what appeared as a jet contrail in the Western Sky of Tucson.  The contrail was heading Sout-Southeast at a great rate of speed.  The sun was setting at this time which added extra light to the high objects contrail.  The craft itself could not be seen.  At first we thought it was a normal jet.  The contrail disappered after about the first 30seconds of viewing, then reappeared with the craft still in the same direction.  Within 1 min of viewing the object made a sudden turn and headed West, leaving a shrp U shape in the sky.  What was strnge about this was the abnormal speed. I have not seen Airliners fly this fast, so our initial thought was a fighter jet of sorts.   When the craft was heading West a small but noitcable puff of smoke or some turbulance affected the contrail leaving a bulge or bubble in its path.  The craft appeard to pick up speed and disappered into the horizon.  Again this might have been a normal airplane of types at supersonic speed.  The sunset though allowed for some spectaculer viewing. I am not a believer in so called extra terrestrisalas but I am sending this report as to see if any one else saw the object.  I do wish to stay anonimous ((NUFORC:  This report, in several respects, seems to us to not be inconsistent with a contrail pattern that might be left by a military fighter aircraft.));32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
A series of 4 or 5 lights, blinking and moving in a westward direction. No pattern at all to the lights.;2000-02-11 19:20:00;15 MIN;A series of 4 or 5 lights, blinking and moving in a westward direction. No pattern at all to the lights. Okay, I'm standing out on the patio, smoking a cigarette and up in the sky I see these lights. Here's as best a description I can give:It appeared in the southern sky. the lights looked like twinkling stars almost or like plane lights but they would get bright for just a second and then disappear completely (normal planes do not do that you can still see the plane). There would be like 4 or 5 of them going off but not in any sort of order. The area they covered was pretty big, like the area of 5 or 6 planes but there wasn't a distinguishable shape like a circle etc. Really you could not see anything behind the lights it was the lights themselves that let you know something was there.It could not have been different planes either because of the way the lights were moving the plane would have to have the ability to zig up and down and back and forward at a rate of nano seconds. The whole thing was moving west at a pretty rapid clip. I called my husband out, who was annoyed I took him away from a show but as soon as he saw it he also commented, What the hell is that? I was speaking to a friend on the phone who lives a few blocks away. I asked her to go outside and look at the sky. She and her son went outside,her son said it looked like asteroid dust. He is 13. We had to run out to the parking lot to see past the building in front of us but by the time we got to the parking lot it was gone. We live near an air force base so we are used to seeing planes in the sky all the time. This was NOTHING like anything I've ever seen flying in the sky before. Hope this helps.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Craft with bright flashing color-changing lights;2000-11-19 18:00:00;10-20 seconds;Craft with bright flashing color-changing lights We were coming down Mt. Lemmon, from Ski Valley, near the upper section of the road repairs section, when in front of us we saw an object with bright flashing lights. This lights where making sort of a horizontal 8 movement, changing from white to pink, blue and red. The object was moving NE - SW towards the city of Tucson (left to right from our perspective at a low altitude. The flashing lights might make someone believe it to be an airplane, but the airplanes I've seen have stationery lights in the front, bottom or tips of their wings. This looked as if the bottom of the craft had many lights and different colors. We continued moving and didn't see if the craft kept on moving or landed or changed directions. I recall 2 more cars on the road down that evening, and we encountered other cars going up the road maybe someone else saw something. We do not believe this to be an airplane.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Retired Police Officer. 4 Years USAF as Security Police. Currently runs ((deleted)) Company   Witness #2 ((female name deleted)) XX yr old female.  Currently runs ((deleted)) Company   Witness #3 ((name deleted)) XX year old female.  Attends ((deleted)) At 2230 hrs this date, I (deleted))) went to the front of my yard to walk towards a neighbor with the intent of checking on their dog since they were away on vacation.  Our house lies in the Foothills (North Central) area of Tucson adjacent the Catalina Mountains.   I heard one of my dogs bark and I turned to look back at the house. Directly above the house I observed the object.  The object was flying South to North.  I would estimate that it was directly above I-10 (I-10 runs north and south) I-10 is approx. 7 miles due West of my House.  It was approx. 25 degrees above the horizon. I would estimate, and its only an estimate that from light to light would make the object at least one mile long.  My first thought was that the object(s) were in fact 3 objects strung out together and flying in formation. I assumed they were helicopters flying North. There is a Marine aviation base due north of us. Holding my hand at arms length in front of me, I would estimate object would have been (from running light to running light) 4-5 fingers in length.   The object at its southern point had one non-flashing light, in its approx center was another non flashing red light, at its northern point were two lights, one which was white and non blinking and another light very close to the white light and it was red in color and blinking.  My wife exited the front door and I yelled at her to grab the binoculars and run out with them. This she complied with, retireved the binoculars and she and ((name deleted)) came out to join me.  I brought the binoculars into focus and could see the object, which appeared to be moving fairly slow and continuing North. I could also ascertain that there was a darkened area between the 4 lights and that in fact these were not 3 seperate objects. This horizontal area or structure did not appear to be very high but was flattened and line like.       I handed off the binoculars to both ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)).   We continued to watch the object as it continued North.   Approx 3 minutes into the observation the object appeared to make a flight adjustment and it began turning into a North-West flight angle.  At this point and through the Binoculars I could now see the rear end of the object. You could now see that it possessed 2 white lights in the rear of the structure.  It looked as though you were watching the rear end of a car that had two white running lights.  The distance between the two rear light would be approx 1 finger held up at arms length.  The 3 other lights (red in the center, white and blinking red up from) were also still visible but at more of an angle.  The front flashing red light was still visible.  At all times the lights remained at a fixed distance from each other, the distance never varied as it would if you were watching a string of conventional aircraft stuggling to maintain position relative to each other.   I was able to observe the object from its new flight path for approx another minute to two minutes until it was lost over the horizon.  The object appears to have corrected its flight path from when first viewed to the point that it turned NorthWest as I believe I-10 makes the same course adjustments.  I believe the object was certainly following and flying directly above I-10, turning as I-10 turned, but Im not completely sure of this.   I could not estimate its speed, but it was not flying very quickly, but I would guess that if these were in fact helicopters, it would appear to be about the same speed as a helicopter at that distance.  There was no sound.  We contacted a nearby neighbor (too late for him to see it), but as we talked in the driveway he related to me that during a ball game this evening, the crowds were witnessing many strange lights in the night skies.......he didnt elaborate.  I have made a rough sketch of the object, will enhance the sketch and send it off to you in the morning. ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Sketch of the object received.

It was a silvery bright object traveling east to west over mountains in the city of Tucson.;2006-11-26 15:30:00;3-5 min.;It was a silvery bright object traveling east to west over mountains in the city of Tucson. I wittnessed this object in Tucson in the afternoon facing north.   The object was around 1500-20000' up.  It was flying over the Catalina Mountain Range.  This is a high aircraft traffic area but I could not identify it as and aircraft or ballon.   The object mut have been several miles away. It was traveling fairly rapid maybe faster than a commercial jet but not too much faster than that.   It appeared to be highly polished or reflective.  The very bright silver flash from the object is what first caught my attention.   I (and my wife) that it might have been flying parelel to the ground adjusting it flight patteren every second or so causing the silvery flash.   The directon of travel was east to west.  I watched it til I could not see it any more.  However my wife said before it disapeared from veiw it shot up then vanished.  I have seen flashes from aircraft landing but this flash was diffrently colored than those.  I have worked around aricraft for over 18 years and I could not match this with military or civilian aircraft.

It would lurch in one direction and then another.  I’d say that the movement was at least as great as the diameter of the moon or perhaps greater.  I called my husband and he saw it too.  We steadied ourselves on a post outside of our porch and definitely could tell there was movement with respect to the post and eaves.  Then my husband noticed that another star seemed to be moving and I witnessed this also.  We noticed that there were more than one.   I wondered if perhaps we were seeing the earth’s wobble.

Strobes were sometimes fractions of a second apart, sometimes 5-10 seconds or more. Object was dull yellow or white, nearly unnoticeable from star besides slow Northwesterly movement. After spotting it  about a hand's width at arm's length west from 90 degrees straight up, it proceeded northwest and was not visible any longer about a hand's width at arm's length over horizon about 10 minutes later.

Object seen to apparently explode-minutes later 2 large military helicopters in area;2009-02-11 21:20:00;3 seconds;Object seen to apparently explode-minutes later 2 large military helicopters in area While sitting in my living room watching TV, I looked out our sliding glass doors that lead into the backyard. The yard faces to the West of Tucson. Directly on the other side of the backyard wall is a Dry Wash (desert area)  As I looked I observed an object with two red lights, one in the rear and one in the front. I could not tell what shape the object was. Suddenly the object appeared to “explode” It was a bright white flash that was so bright there were other colors produced by this apparent “explosion”, green, red, etc. There was no sound. The object had disappeared.  This sighting was approximately 2 to 3 seconds. It was very fast, but long enough to see what I saw. Approx. 10 minutes later, myself, husband, and daughter observed 2 very large Military helicopters flying in from the Northwest, flying Southeast. Since there are numerous bases in the area, including Davis Monthan to our South, the sightings of helicopters isn’t unusual. The helos were flying slow and very, very low, in fact I don’t recall ever seeing helicopters this low before and neither has my husband. Also, the flight corridor that they were utilizing is one I have never seen them use before. They flew directly over the area that I observed the object in, which was approx. 200 feet west of my back fence. May have been a coincidence, but then again it may not have.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

UFO Sighting in Tucson, AZ:  I was standing in front of my apartment, watering my plants, when I saw a strange shape appear out in the sky.  At first I thought it was a balloon or large piece of paper blown by the wind, but then I realized it was too big to be that.  It was about 2 to 3 miles away, and it was floating 300-400 feet off the ground.  It was flashing, and seemed to be spinning as well. The sun was at an angle that I couldn’t see it too well.  It rose at a speed that was far faster than the wind could carry it. I was contemplating calling my mom, when another one appeared coming from below and to the right. It went up and joined the other one, it followed it for a few seconds and then went off on it’s own.  I don’t recall what exactly they did in terms of formation. I called my mom over and showed them to her.  She saw them better because she had sunglasses on.  Another one appeared several seconds later. They were flying around erratically, constantly changing altitudes. The highest I saw them get was 4000-5000 feet.  By the time they left there were 4-5 of them and we were sure these were UFO’s. They left going north. I can’t really say how big they were, but they were big enough to be seen without assistance from very far.  I think they were probes or scouts of some sort, but I’m not sure.  They were definitely NOT something I’ve seen before, except on TV in shows about aliens or UFO’s.  Thank you for your time.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

When I came back out 20 seconds later they where gone. We both where like what the heck was that. After a few minutes 3 more appeared then another one, then another one. I took there pictures. And as fast as they appeared they then disappeared in a different order of how they appeared. One minute later 3 more popped up. I took there pictures. And once again as fast as they appeared they disappeared. This went on for a good 15 minutes off and on again. They where big red and orange lights.  I could not see any big body attached to the lights. But when the lights went out I could see an object behind it, but I could not make it out. It was getting dark outside. Two of them split from the pack and headed more west at the same time of 4 more coming back into view. But I did get pictures and I will take in the camera and get them developed tomorrow. 25 minutes from seeing the first one the Air Force had 3 planes circling the area we seen all the UFO’s. They where not any air craft that I see every day, and that light that is was putting out was high in the sky. It was not any flares, and it was not coming from any type of air craft we have.

Unusual Lights Above Catalina Mountains in Tucson;2013-11-30 20:00:00;3-4 minutes;Unusual Lights Above Catalina Mountains in Tucson At approximately 8pm in the northern Tucson area of Sabino Canyon, while observing the night sky, a friend of mine and I witnessed a dull whitish light moving in a southerly direction towards the city of Tucson.  At the time of the sighting, it was located almost directly over the mid section of the Catalina Mountains north of Tucson. The light did not have the characteristics of a 'beam' with a ray emanating forward, but rather that of a glowing effect that was constant in luminescence.  Estimating height would put it at several miles up however there was insufficient evidence to make more than a guess. It moved very slowly relative to what one might see from an airliner or even that of a small plane.  There were no strobe lights seen during this sighting and no other color was present than the dull white glow.  No sound could be heard either. As we watched its flight path, it moved towards, and eventually into, a small cloud. Fully expecting to see it emerge on the other side of this small cloud I was surprised to see nothing emerge. When the cloud moved on, there was no light anywhere in the area. A short time later, we again witnessed what appeared to be another light in the same general area and same characteristics as the first only moving somewhat perpendicular to that of the first object's path. This time there was no cloud in the object's path but after a couple of minutes, it just faded to nothing. Both objects seemed to travel about the same distance in their respective directions before disappearing.  Both were larger relative to the 'moving spot' one sees when a satellite passes overhead.  Logical assumptions as to expected characteristics of these moving objects did not seem to apply when trying to put them in a frame of context for normal plane or helicopter flight.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
4 Orange Lights Illuminating In Succession.;2014-01-07 19:08:00;1 minute;4 Orange Lights Illuminating In Succession At approximately 19:08 hrs on 1/07/2014, I witnessed through my garage door windows 2 bright orange lights about 30 degrees above the western horizon from Vail, AZ.  Within a few seconds, 2 more identical orange lights appeared to the right of the first 2 in a very slight downward arc. I couldn't judge distance but it appeared that the lights were possibly 10-15 miles distant.  The lights were striking in appearance in that they were bright and didn't conform in nature to anything normally seen with conventional airborne objects.  I grabbed a camera close by, opened my garage door and stepped out on my driveway.  The lights had disappeared.  However, approximately 10 miles to the south of that position, an orange light appeared very low in the sky. It disappeared and reappeared within a few seconds in that location.  About 60 seconds later, it appeared about 30 miles NW of that position once again as an orange light near the KITT Peak Observatory area.  Within abou! t 5 minutes of my observation, I observed (and heard) 2 USAF jets in the exact same area of my original sighting.  The jets circled the city of Tucson from what I could tell for about 10 minutes.  There were no further sightings at this point.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Silver object appears in small cloud, both disappear.;2014-04-08 14:50:00;8 seconds;Silver object appears in small cloud, both disappear. Re above:  I don't know that it was a craft: could have been some sort of inversion reflection?   Possible Ufo sighting by me tue 8 apr 2014, 2:50pm, 20 miles north of Tucson, AZ.  UFO- for me doesn't mean unidentified since most planes and other flying objects are unidentified as to tail number, etc.. I prefer to call the U in UFO   Unusual or Unexpected or maybe  OFO, Odd Flying Object.  This object didn't fly- it appeared (or I noticed it) and disappeared. I was on a dirt road at 2:50pm on april 8th.  As I turned north, I saw in a mostly clear blue sky, straight ahead and about 30% above level (landscape here too irregular landscape to call it horizon), a wisp of cloud about 2 long horizontally at extended thumb and forefinger, about 1/2 high.  As I looked at it the center became a bright silver, irregular shaped, like metal shining through the cloud.  The silver disappeared back into the cloud and the cloud shrank in both dimensions and disappeared.   Total time from when I noticed the cloud to total disappearance about 8 seconds.  This was not a reflection off a windshield.  I've never seen a cloud disappear like this. Sun at this time of day was on the left, a little forward of 90deg left. There is an airbase south of here (Davis Monthan), and I regularly see planes from there, but but I've never seen one manifest itself from within a small cloud and then both disappear.  Most planes here are not shiny. This was diffent from anything I've seen before in the sky. It is the first truly odd thing I've ever seen in the sky. Oddly, it left me slightly disquieted, almost a prickling of the hair. I'm 68, retired, former electronics engineer, former computer tech with a missionary organization, formerly lived several places in U.S., Costa Rica, Peru, Mexico. I used to be a student pilot, failed to get license only due to time sched for leaving for Peru. I'm familiar with UFO lore, but never seen anything unusual, and have no particular desire to.   I listen irregularly to Rense com and Peter Davenport's reports, which is why I came here.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Two unknown objects with solid blue lights, moving rapidly, without sound.;2014-07-04 21:05:00;1 minute;Two unknown objects with solid blue lights, moving rapidly, without sound. On July 4, 2014, at approximately 8:55 pm my husband, two friends and myself were waiting for the fireworks to begin.   We were looking at the sky when we saw a solid blue light moving at a very high rate of speed and noticed another following very close directly behind it.  There was no change in speed or trajectory.  The craft had no navigation lights or anti-collision lights as required on commercial, private, or military aircraft.  Altitude, shape and size were not able to be determined.   They were moving from South to North, on the East side of Sombrero Peak.  They flew directly over our house and made no sound what so ever.  There were no other air craft in the area.   We lost all internet WIFI connection for approximately an hour afterwards.   My husband and his friend have at least 40 years of aircraft experience between them and neither had ever seen anything like this.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
6 orange slow moving objects in western Tucson sky.;2014-10-04 23:00:00;6 minutes;6 orange slow moving objects in western Tucson sky Coming home from dinner, saw six separate orange lights in the sky.  The objects were moving in an up and down type pattern.  Some going up, some going down, all in a slow motion.  Thought it might be helicopters or aircraft, but no sound and maneuvers were not patterns aircraft would be doing at 11pm at night, if at all.  Then, five of the orange lights shifted to form a triangle and slowly drifted down the skyline in a very tight pattern, more like a V actually.  A V shape that resembled more of a &gt symbol.  Then those five orange lights turned off, but you could still see the objects maintain their shape, but remain completely still and stationary.   The sixth orange light then floated slowly up and to the left, and then slowly shifted to the right and eventually stopped in it's tracks as well.  It remained lit for a few minutes after that, but then it also went dark.   As I am writing this, the objects can still be seen sitting in the sky, unlit, stationary, and almost seeming to blend in with the normal sky constellations seen to the West at night.  The lighted portion of the even lasted about 6 minutes or so, but total time so far has been about half an hour.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Witnessed an impossible eclipse of crescent moon.;2015-04-20 21:45:00;00:10;Witnessed an impossible eclipse of crescent moon. Approximately 7:45 pm, April 20th, 2015, in Tucson, Arizona, I was running in the desert, away from ambient lights under clear sky.  I watched an eclipse of the crescent moon.   Crescent light shrank to a point at bottom of moon, a few minutes of darkness, then point lit again, expanded back to crescent.   I thought it was an eclipse, but now i realize this is impossible, the crescent moon in in front of the earth.  This means that an object larger than the moon passed before the moon.   I saw all this with my naked eye.  Didn't have my phone to take a photo.    I am male, 46 years old. I am from this area.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Bright white orb over Mt Lemmon Tucson AZ;2016-12-27 18:00:00;2 hours;Bright white orb over Mt Lemmon Tucson AZ Around 6pm, caught site of large bright white (sometimes yellow-gold) orb at top of Mt. Lemmon.  Thought it must be a planet just rising over horizon of mountain, though it seemed too far north for a planet, and the sky was overcast so other stars were hazy but this was super bright and pulsing clearly (like a star on the horizon does). Then saw to right of object, probably several miles to the east along top of mountain, a faint small white light rheostat in slowly, then grow brighter, then rheostat to a deep ruby red, get really bright, then switch off suddenly as if a light switch turned it off.  This happened multiple times in sequence of about 1-3 minutes apart.  Occasional flashes of similar red light on the opposite side of the large white/yellow orb, like a light ‘echo’, not as ‘solid’ but there just the same.  The phenomena was persisting so long, I drove up to Sabino Canyon for a closer look but the sky there was dark and couldn’t get as panoramic a view of the range.  Nothing happening there.  Around 8pm when I returned to original location of siting (farther from the range where you can get a broader view of entire top of Mt. Lemmon), there it was again, the bright orb, as if it hadn’t moved (and a planet would have moved in 2 hours)! My memory isn’t precise but for the next 5 minutes or so, what a light show!  The bright white orb blinked out, then suddenly reappeared.  Blinked out then reappeared.  Then moved super-fast to the right about ¼ inch (viewed from several miles distant).  Then blinked out.   Then reappeared.  There was almost a dance between this larger light and the smaller red lights. A lot of movement, blinking in and out.  It is hard to recall details but all I could think was “this ain’t no planet”.  There are radio signal towers on Mt Lemon but they pulse and stay turned on all the time, and they are in a different location from where I saw the red lights.  These smaller red lights were shutting off completely, then phasing back in first as white lights, then as ruby red lights. Then blinking off instantaneously.  The last thing I saw was the white orb rheostat to a beautiful golden yellow, 2x or even 3x its original size and then it looked like it split in half and then it simply disappeared, along with the red lights.  Poof.  Gone.  The overriding perception I got was that there was some kind of transdimensional shape shifting happening. I wonder if anybody else saw this in Tucson.  It was mind blowing.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Bright red light traveled across sky in Tucson, Arizona.  No sound, then flickers out to the west of city.;2017-02-08 22:30:00;10 minutes;Bright red light traveled across sky in Tucson, Arizona.  No sound, then flickers out to the west of city. I was in my back yard on the 8th of Feb. 2017.  I do amature astronomy and am outside many nights. I saw what I thought was an airplane at first coming from the south east.  As it came closer I noticed it had no blinking lights. It was just one very bright red light.  It was so different than anything I have ever seen that I called for my wife to come out to see what she thought.  She was also puzzled as to what it could be.   It proceeded to fly overhead just south of our location and toward the west.  While it was in the western sky at about 40 degrees over the horizon the light sputtered off and on about 4 times, in about an 8 to 10 seconds period then went completely out.  There was no sound coming from the light and the sly was clear, no clouds and an almost full moon.   I would very much like to know what could cause such a light.  I have ruled out stars, airplanes, helicopters, satellites, space station and satellite flares.  Even ruled out a rocket since I don't! believe rocket launches go over Tucson.   It traveled several miles across the sky so it was not a civilian drone.  Could it have been a military drone?  I have no idea what it was.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

A long string of lights moving very slowly across the western night sky from the north to the south.;2019-11-11 18:55:00;1+ minute;A long string of lights moving very slowly across the western night sky from the north to the south. On November 11, 2019, at approximately 18:55.  My family and I, along with a 14 year-old neighbor kid were enjoying the evening in the back yard.  We live in Tucson, Arizona.  Our home is located about 2 miles north of the Tucson International Airport (TIA) and the Arizona Air National Guard base.  As I was conversing with my wife, our 10-year-old son said, “What kind of plane is that?”  He pointed to the west and I reluctantly looked because it is a constant question they would ask me. Just to shed some light on my background, I am a 23-year military veteran and former 10-year fire fighter, and 12-year law enforcement officer.  I am very familiar with air traffic, types of aircraft, and I also have a bit of surveillance experience on looking for aircraft using binoculars, ground radar, thermal and night vision equipment. So back to my sighting. I told my wife, come look at this!  She also watched in amazement and we could not believe what we were seeing.  This line of lights was very long and did not appear to be an aircraft of any sorts and I could see it still entering the atmosphere.  The object was very long and cruising at a very slow speed.  It was entering from the north and traveling south.  I would say, it was between the planet Saturn and the star Ras Alhague, slightly above them. As I held my hand out and measured It, it was about 5 inches in length as I looked towards the western sky. It was well above the horizon growing brighter. Each light was perfectly spaced apart, but some had distance between the middle lights. The middle lights seemed brighter, especially the one in the center. We were able to watch it for about a minute or so. It was not a meteor shower or a single meteorite. This was moving way to slow, kind of like watching a balloon float across the sky then it just disappeared out of the atmosphere as it neared just above Saturn.  We all tried to take pictures and videos using our Iphones but they could not pick up the image. I have experienced unusual things in my career but nothing ever like this.  I immediately called the Davis Monthan air force base operator and asked to be connected to Air Operations management.  I got no answer and I hung up. I called a supervisor from the U.S. Border Patrol in Three Points, Arizona, to see if any of their guys reported anything over the radio.  Of course, you can imagine I was laughed at! but I know how it is.  These are things you just don’t talk about. I hope this description can give some valuable information on what we saw.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

It was absolutely quiet and I spotted something moving above me what seemed translucent like a cloaking device but was not invisible it was like a dark haze and was large in size no lights and was either circle or triangular and made no noises. it was moving fast south.  I grabbed my phone to shoot a video but it seemed gone by the time I got my video going.  I then looked around the sky line another 2 mins and nothing. I stepped back inside and reviewed my video and happened to catch a 1 frame glimpse of the object 44 second into my 45 second video.  That one frame the only moment it was visible as a glow admitted from below the object.  but it atleast shows that something was really there in the skys that I saw.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Ball of light vanishes in the SE;2021-06-02 21:15:00;2 minutes;Ball of light vanishes in the SE It appeared in the Wast, made its way East/ Southeast. looked like the headlight of the airplane, but when it got overhead, and even when it passed, it still looked like the light was shining  at us so maybe a sphere of light? once it passed overhead it zig zagged, but just enough to make it look like a wobble from that distance up. After that the ball of light had a small flash that was barely brighter than the craft/ ball of light itself. After the flash, it dimmed in the southeast direction, but the dimming was almost as if it was moving away VERY fast and not a dimming of the light itself.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
