A circle with maybe 15 white lights around its perimeter was observed to slowly glide across the sky without sound.  After about 2 minutes of observing it in this matter, it immediately changed direction and accelerated at extraordinary speed toward the horizon.

Two white spheres suddenly appear in clear , NE Tucson skies in daylight , moving eastward, disappearing after 4 min.;2003-03-31 14:00:00;4 minutes;Two white spheres suddenly appear in clear , NE Tucson skies in daylight , moving eastward, disappearing after 4 min. Two spherical ufos seen in Tucson skies from 2:00 to 2:04 in the afternoon, approximately 45 degrees altitude, above the mountains, north/northeast, heading eastward from viewpoint of Tucson International Airport, second floor, looking north/northeast with Catalina Mountains as the backdrop. Clear skies.  Appearance of spheres were the same size, their being the size of a lower case o (from my viewpont)at the type-size of a 10 on Microsoft Word.  The spheres appeared as white but also illuminated uniformly from within--not as reflected light, no flashing light or lights.  The spheres did not glow.  The two objects suddenly appeared in mid air literally out of the blue.  They did not appear from a point of origin moving from the west to the east.  Objects first appeared in the north/northeastern sky at a 2 o'clock angle from Tucson International Airport, which is located between Tucson Blvd. and Campbell Ave., and moved eastwardly.  The objects were not in any formation.  One sphere was higher in the sky and to the left of the lower sphere.  I was waiting for my flight, looking out the north windows and first saw an airliner about 30,000 to 35,000 feet up flying from the west to the east  The jet was at a more northeasterly point on its path when the two spheres appeared to pop out of the blue lower to and behind the airliner by two mountain peaks.  The spheres dropped down a bit, seemed to stay still for some seconds, and moving more slowly than the jet, also moved in an easterly path with the higher sphere disappearing about 30 seconds after first notice.  When these objects suddenly appeared, I was surprised at their spherical shape. The shape of the jet was clearly recognizable.  These objects were not recognizable as any known aircraft.  I called over to a woman in the room to come see this, and she saw the two spheres, the jet, and the one sphere disappear and the jet fly out of her sight to the east with the second object also having disappeared before the jet was out of sight.  This observer has lived in Tucson for 44 years and is familiar with the military and civilian aircraft in the skies, with clear skies the rule for Tucson, cloudy skies rare.  These objects are the first unidentifiable flying objects or crafts that the observer has ever seen.

Circlular rotating lighted low flying craft west of Ina at Silverbell Rd, object moved slowly then instantly disappeared.;2004-02-24 18:43:00;3 to 5 min;Circlular rotating lighted low flying craft west of Ina at Silverbell Rd, object moved slowly then instantly disappeared. I was driving west on Ina coming to the Silverbell Rd. when I saw what I thought was an extremly large plane.  It had three lights, then another came on, and another, it was them I realized it was a circle of rotating lights.  I made sure to keep my eye on it as I was coming to the light at Ina & Silverbell, I watched it, then right before my eyes it disappeared.  There were no clouds that it could have gone behind because it was flying to low.  It was heading east, planes here don't usually head that way as the airport is to the south.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

typical saucer shaped craft Stationery in the sky appearing to be watching military air show.;2007-03-15 14:00:00;15 minutes;typical saucer shaped craft Stationery in the sky appearing to be watching military air show. I can’t give the exact date, but can give you an approximate date because it was during spring training baseball in Tucson.  There also was an airshow going on at nearby  Davis- Monthan Air Force Base.  The year was 2007. My husband, son and I were watching the game, but were distracted by the air show when I noticed idle in the sky between the parks we were at and the airshow was a disk.  I got my son and husband’s attention to see what I was seeing.  Both watched with me for several minutes.  I then turned to a neighbor to the left of me to take a look.  When I turned back to see the UFO it was not visible. I have to go back a second to tell you that I was thinking to myself, I see you. It was not visible to me the rest of the game and so my attention was drawn back to the game.  A couple of hours later we walked back to our car out in the lot and began our drive back home.   We went on with the rest of our day and there was really no other conversation about what we’d seen. Sometime in the very early hours of the morning, I was awakened by a lime green light in my face.  I was aware that I had been sound asleep and now I was seeing something that made no sense to me.  It had writing along the edge of it.  It seemed to be suspended at head level with me.  I could not make out the symbols.  The light seemed to have formed the size and shape of a VCR.  I sat looked to the right of me where my husband was sleeping soundly to see where I was just to get my bearings.  The clock was where it was supposed to be, and then I looked to the foot of my bed toward the right where the t.v. sat with its light in the lower corner.  Both the clock and t.v. were red yet what I was seeing was lime fluorescent green. I then looked slightly to the left at the foot of my bed and saw that there were 3 small people standing there and one more standing a bit further to the right of the rest.  I have an executive height dresser which sat behind them so I could gauge the height of these little people.  Not one was a full head higher than my dresser. I felt a bit unnerved by this time and turned back toward my husband and wrapped my arms around him and went to sleep.   I didn’t know if they stayed or left and really wanted to feel safe. The next morning very early my son and I went out to the car, the morning dew was still on the window where I saw an unusual hand print of what I only can guess was a thumbprint of some sort and 3 fingers imprinted on the window behind the driver’s seat.  My son and I both looked at it and then looked toward the west where we were met with a very, very bright white light.  So bright it frightened me.  I put my arm around my son and led him back into the house.  He had seen it also. Since that time, we have had occasion to feel some very subtle sensations in our bodies.   I was unaware that my son had a visit from these little people, but he claimed to have had something that woke him too.  I never asked him what all he had experienced that night. Interestingly enough I called my daughter in the bay area to tell her what had happened.  She was in disbelief of course until I told her about the fluorescent green light when she said to me, “mom you aren’t going to believe this, but there was a green light in my room for just a fraction of a second”. I felt that I should say something as time will inevitably fade my memory of events. I suppose it sounds a bit corny to add that I feel we are looked in on from time to time as I believe this area to be somewhat of a hotbed of activity. We were still very new to this area and I always wondered if they were curious or keeping track of the amount of new population growth in this area, but I speculate.  I really have no idea why they were here, but I do know that they were able to keep watch of me at the game, follow me to my car, follow us home and know exactly where I sat in the car and furthermore knew I knew they were aware of me as much as I was aware of them. I don’t have anything else to add, but am unafraid of any repercussions.  I do not drink or take drugs and I’m not crazy.  The story you’ve read is my account of the events that occurred to the best of my recollection.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

i believe in ufo  because of seeing;2007-12-22 01:30:00;arizona;i believe in ufo  because of seeing As I was driving on highway 10 around 1:30 am, I looked up and saw a very bright light south east of highway10. I asked my mother who was sitting next to me in the vehicle if she knew what it was, of coarse she did not.  We thought it might have been the north star however we were not headed north and the light seemed to get big, then we thought maybe it was a satellite however even satellite don’t get larger . What ever it was, seemed to stay in one place, it just seemed to get bigger and brighter.  My mom and I was talking and she told me something shocking, that she believe  that she actually saw a alien,  it was in a canister  which was completely sealed , the canister was army green with army wording, stating confidential and also had numbers and letter on it.  There was a glass like opening, on the side of it, she was able to see it, and she said it was in this green liquid and that this creature had huge eyes on it diamond chapped face two hole she thought could have been for a nose yet there were no mouth on it.  The thing was very small no bigger than 18 inches it fit some what loose in the canister.  It had legs and arms.  I asked if she thought it was real, she said she believed it was because of the canister and were the canister was found. The canister was ceiled with tracking number on it she believed it also had a sort of lock on it.   The thing is locked away, the person that has it is afraid to come forward with it due to the government, and how it was received;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Three Shinny objects spotted over Tucson AZ;2009-05-09 16:30:00;30 minutes;Three Shinny objects spotted over Tucson AZ On Saturday May 9th 2009 at 1630 my wife an I were at a park in downtown Tucson Arizona.  It was a bright sunny day with no clouds.  We laid down to enjoy the day and we both spotted plane flying over head.  It was a normal passenger plane.  We are near an Air Force base and an International airport.   My wife and I are under a pine tree.  The plane disappears into the braches, and then we spot a very small yet super shinny object up In the sky.  It seemed to be higher than the plane and further away.  The plane crossed between us and the object in our field of view. The object was stationary.  I thought it was an astronomical event, maybe Venus shining very brightly for some odd reason.  So we did not try and find the plane after it flew over the tree we were under.  But neither of us ever saw it again. The UFO stayed in its position for approximately 15 minutes.  After a while we both had taken our eyes off of it, only too look back to its location and not see it there. Instead it was heading northeast at a decent pace, blinking like a light.  Its speed was maybe a little faster than a cruising passenger plane.  However we could not judge its altitude well.  It flew too far away and out of sight for us.  We did not have a video or picture abilities with us.  My wife and I were surprised and proceeded to try and interpret what we had saw. Then after we were digesting what we had saw, we looked back up and she spotted two more objects that were the exact same luminosity and size.  They were floating very slowly in the same direction as the previous one.  They floated away over a period of ten minutes and out of view, however they never blinked or sped up.   My wife and I did not spot anything else that day.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

My wife and I were returning home from the movies.  It was a cloudy night and while we were only about a half mile from home, when both of us saw a bright light shine above the clouds.   The light on the clouds was about the size of a 747 airplane.  The light stayed on for only a few seconds then disappeared only to reappear again one or two seconds later.   Once it came back, it disappeared again after only a few seconds.  If this was an actual 747 plane or even a helicopter, neither one of us didn’t hear any sounds of either one.

Red and orange orb over the foothills in Tucson, Arizona.;2014-01-02 18:30:00;20 minutes;Red and orange orb over the foothills in Tucson, Arizona. My family (2 adults, 2 small children) were driving in the Catalina foothills north of Tucson, Arizona, and I (the passenger) observed what I thought was a small campfire on the mountainside.   We drove up the road to get a better look and so that I could report it to the sheriff's office, but as we approached it became clear that the fire was actually a large orb of red and orange light.   When we were as close as we could be at the top of the road, the object lifted off the mountainside and flew very quickly over our car, but it was nowhere to be seen when I stepped out to see where it went. Spooked, we went back down a side street to turn around and leave.  As we got back to the main road though, the red and orange orb was back hovering over the mountainside again where it blinked off and back on occasionally.  It appeared fairly close but made no sound at all.   This went on for about ten minutes before we drove away not wanting to scare the kids who were already a little shaken by it.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

They were moving in an unorganized pattern back and forth.  Sometimes they would stay completely still and then they would move and make sharp quick right and left turns.  Sometimes they would pair up and cross each other.   They were very high up in the sky and at that altitude it is unlikely that jets can move in that formation.   We watched as they moved back and forth then slowly disappeared.   We tried to take a video but it didn't show them due to the bright sunlight.  It was a clear sunny day and they looked like white dots.   At that altitude I don't know anything that can sit still for 5 minutes then move across the sky very fast then sit still again.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Orange light split in two and then melded back into one light before vanishing;2014-10-27 18:55:00;10 minutes;Orange light split in two and then melded back into one light before vanishing My wife and I were driving West on I-10 near Houghton Rd. exit when we noticed an array of twinkling lights hovering just SW of Tucson, Arizona.  It was a clear night and we counted at least six white lights that were flickering at what seemed to be a much faster rate than ordinary commercial or military aircraft.  My first thought was that maybe Tucson Airport (or possibly Davis-Monthan Air Force base) was experiencing some kind of incident on a runway causing air traffic to backup and circle in a holding pattern.  This was not the case.  Soon it was clear that these lights were not flying but hovering in place.   Not too long after the shimmering lights had appeared, a larger, bright orange light materialized beneath them.   Then things got a bit stranger.  The large orange light appeared to split into two distinct orbs, each retaining the same shape and color of the original.  In a matter of seconds the two lights merged together again into a single orb before vanishing along with the twinkling background lights.   At this point my wife was more concerned about my staying on the road because I was starting to swerve in and out of my lane.  The best that I could tell is that at least some of the twinkling lights flew into the larger orange light.  I couldn't believe what we were seeing.   As I exited Houghton Rd. we parked to see if the activity was still continuing.  We saw nothing.   As I started driving North on Houghton I looked into my rear-view mirror and saw the orange light appearing once again.  It did a repeat performance- split in two and then melded back into one light before vanishing.  Then that was it.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
These were 6 or 8 ORBS, not just lights.;2015-01-03 01:15:00;6 minutes;These were 6 or 8 ORBS not just lights. I was letting the dog out for the night, when a coyote howl called my attention to the SE area.  In the night sky there were 6 to 8 ORBS reddish in color moving silently to the NNW. the were over the Tucson mid-town area.  Davis Monthan AFB is in that area.   I thought at first it was the Pima County Patrol aircraft (a turbo prop). However it was all red ORBS not red and green NAV lights nor did they blink.  Also, the Sherriff's aircraft has white strobes anti-collision markers. The object moved NNW then without a stop, retraced its path.  In a few more seconds it started straight UP.  It was a steady glide at no Super sonic Speeds just a fast rate until it was undiscernible from the stars.  It was a New or full moon and there was a reddish star or planet at the moon's 8 o'clock. I tried to make my own investigation and am not convinced that a Drone Octicopter: was the object, because the ORBS didn't have border FUZZ as the lights in my area have, ie: stop lights, aircraft & tower markers.  Furthermore, the SCALES would not support a toy aircrafts size.  I had very good sight reference points. I tried to make a report to MUFON but they said  you have done your own research.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Large light approaches/retreats silently.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 19:17:00;15 minutes;Large light approaches/retreats silently Hello. Native Tucsonan here. I just noticed to the West a sea foam green bright light with my husband & neighbors at just about 7:15pm-7:17pm over the CAP canal, next to Ryan’s Air Field, on Bopp Rd. in Tucson, Arizona.  It was a light that seemed to come in towards us slowly, then it backed out as fast as it had appeared-finally fading to black (full night sky).  The entire experience lasted about 15 minutes, as the glow remnant took this long to dissipate fully. At first we thought that we were witnessing an aircraft/drone (silent) headed directly towards us at about 25mph due to a bright whitish-green “spotlight” approaching us. The spotlight had a bright green line\in its center.  It startled & frightened us.  Then it reversed, heading backwards as fast as it had come in. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.

Bright yellow pulsating light, 3 sec.  And exploded into a white light.;2016-06-02 04:00:00;2 seconds;Bright yellow pulsating light, 3sec.  And exploded into a white light. I do not think it was a UFO. Southwest Tucson, North On Midvale Park, i saw a bright yellow light in the sky, bright enough that it made me look up,  it seemed to get brighter in 2-3 intervals and then like exploded into a white light and appeared to go downward.  I hope other people saw this or im hoing to think im going nuts. I saw the weird lights in Tucson several years ago, the same lights a lot of people saw.

Large, fast, bright white circular object maneuvering in a strange manner;2019-03-09 19:10:00;15 seconds;Large, fast, bright white circular object maneuvering in a strange manner Traveling west on I-10 approximately 30 miles East of Tucson, Arizona my fiancé and I observed a large fast moving object in the sky.  It was bright white with no blinking lights that are typical with aircraft.  It was moving at an intensely/abnormally fast rate of speed. It accelerated, totally stopped, and dropped in altitude.  It accelerated again at a little slower speed and made another weird turn. It did not move, turn, or accelerate like any aircraft we have seen.  It was making weird angular drops and rises in altitude.  As we were almost too far away to see it anymore, it dropped again to a pretty low altitude and was almost bouncing around.  There was no place to turn around to go back and see if it was still there. We were both shocked and amazed at what we saw. While observing the object, in the far distance behind it we could see traditional aircraft in the skies.  They were much further away, moving so much slower, and they had blinking lights on them.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

Saw a bright, star like object, very high up, moving erratically in all directions for over an hour.;2020-03-29 21:00:00;2 hours;Saw a bright, star like object, very high up, moving erratically in all directions for over an hour. At approximately 9 pm, on the 29th of March 2020, my wife and I noticed an object outside our bedroom window from our bed.  At first it didn't seem much different than a star, same shape and brightness as one.  But as we were looking out we began to notice that it was moving.  It would sometimes move very fast for large distances then seemingly stop.  It moved erratically, in all directions.  Sometimes it would do loops and circles before coming to a stop once more. It flickered different shades of light, similar to a star.  It did seem like it had a beam of light shining out in one direction from it, but it was hard to tell as it was very high up.  I'm talking upper atmosphere to low Earth orbit high.  It seemed to move with the rotation of the Earth but constantly moving erratically throughout the duration of the event. It seemed to be far too unpredictable to be any sort of manned craft, but also too controlled to be a natural phenomenon.  We live just on the outskirts of the North side of Tucson and noticed it in the sky to the East of the city.  We watched this for nearly two hours until it was out of our view.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
Glowing balls;2020-12-05 22:30:00;About a minute;Glowing balls Left to run to the store at 9:27 pm as I’m walking to my car I glance over and something catches my eye but I thought I must have been tripping because it looked like my neighbors tree was on fire but when I focused I thought it was just an amber street light shining thru but once I got in my truck and to the stop sign the huge amber glowing ball which I then thought was a plane on fire was just chilling with me it was fading in and out moving fairly slow compared to the helicopter that flew by it which I originally thought was there to help (idk what I was thinking my brain was everywhere) a car pulled up behind me and I had to move I had been filming it so I moved and then I couldn’t get my video back on and as I looked up there as another one! Even bigger and seemed closer they both flew slowly west then zoomed out south and disappeared with one still flickering occasionally. I should mention I’ve been seeing several of these every day since and other que! stionable things I can’t really explain but I have lots of video!;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691

On 5/5/2021 my wife and I witnessed flying objects in the sky.  They were white and circular flying in a linear pattern flying at high speeds. 30 or so of them became in view of the naked eye one by one and were all gone in a matter of 5 minutes.  They had to be flying at high speeds to disappear so quickly.  My wife and I have never seen anything like it.  I typically see satellites orbiting the earth, but nothing compares to what we witnessed last night.  I have a background in finance, while my wife is a registered nurse.;32.2474464114832;-110.926543221691
