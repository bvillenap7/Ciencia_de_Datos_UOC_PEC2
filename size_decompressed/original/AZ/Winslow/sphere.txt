Bright light in Arizona sky - took some photos.;2007-09-02 20:37:00;5-10 minutes;Bright light in Arizona sky - took some photos. My wife and I were driving east on I-40 near Winslow, Arizona.  My wife saw a very bright light towards the south and pointed it out to me.  It was much larger than a star and a very bright white light.  It was kind of oval shaped.  It was not moving. 	My wife tried to take a picture but our camera did not work.  We continued to watch i.  It stayed bright the whole time.  Clouds started to move over it and it would peak through the breaks in the clouds.  We took some pictures of that.  In one of the pictures the bright light is reflecting onto the cloud.  The object disappeared soon after we took the pictures. 	There is an odd disc shaped object in one of our pictures that we did not see at the time.  That second object may be a cloud but I am not sure because we did not see at that time (it was just interesting to see when we got home).  I am not sure what we saw.  I have always been interested in UFOs but this is the first time I have ever seen something that I could not explain. ((NUFORC Note:  If the object was not Jupiter, which was in the southern sky at this time, we do not know what the witnesses observed.  PD));35.0265;-110.6902
Sphere on I-40 east of Winslow, AZ.;2010-02-15 13:30:00;3-5 minutes;Sphere on I-40 east of Winslow, AZ I was a long haul truck driver for many years.  I was enroute to Virginia then Canada from California.  It was a bright blue day in the Arizona high desert. I saw this ball in the sky, hovering over I-40 from a considerable distance.   As I got closer, the ball seemed to move downn the freeway.  As I got even closer, it stopped, then it like had something slide over it and it disappeared.  But weirdly, my truck got warmer inside and the sky was shimmering. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date may be approximate.  PD));35.0265;-110.6902
