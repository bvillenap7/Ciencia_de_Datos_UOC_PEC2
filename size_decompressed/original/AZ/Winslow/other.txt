Silent average-looking airplane hovers over Leupp exit butte on I-40 for 15-30 mins, hundreds of witnesses.;2002-10-01 14:00:00;15-30 mins;Silent average-looking airplane hovers over Leupp exit butte on I-40 for 15-30 mins, hundreds of witnesses. Let me start by saying that unfortunately, I am unsure of the date of the incident.  I know this was around the time I earned my driver’s license, but the date may be off by a year or so.  Sorry for the inconvenience. At the time, I was living in Winslow AZ, and two friends and I were driving to Flagstaff in the late afternoon to catch a movie.  I was sitting in the back seat, passenger’s side. We were traveling west on I-40, coming up on the Leupp exit. This is the first exit after Winslow, traveling west.  At this exit, there is a large butte.  I’m not sure how tall the butte is, but here is a link to google maps where you can see the actual google photo of the butte.  There is a car and a couple of road signs in the picture to help with the scale of the photo. http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=35.065833,-110.825272&spn=0,0.084543&z=14&layer=c&cbll=35.069161,-110.834558&panoid=--tNYYmSTeVgXLV4q9Gpgw&cbp=12,0,,0,5   As we approached this exit and butte, we were startled by the sight of what appeared to be a hovering commercial airplane to the right of the car.  Just an average airplane, only without any insignia or markings.  We could clearly see the windows, without people in them.  Not only was it hovering, but it was incredibly low.  Only two or three times the height of the butte off the ground, less than 1000 feet.  There was no sound. Like I said, this took place during the afternoon, and well within the sight of the highway. It was practically hovering over the exit ramp.  There were tons of people pulled over on the side of the road, going in both directions.  They were talking about it, some on their phones, others were taking pictures. We were too scared to stick around to see what would happen next, so we kept driving.  I remember turning around in my seat to watch it out of the back window.  It stayed in the same position until I lost sight of it. How many people must drive on that major interstate in the afternoon on any given day during a 15-30 minute period? My guess is about 500.   Everyone who drove by saw it, it was impossible not to. I’m hoping one of those people will remember seeing this too, possible post a picture.  I have never been able to find any documentation of the incident.
