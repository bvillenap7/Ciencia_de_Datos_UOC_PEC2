Fast moving, large red crescent object;2007-09-13 19:50:00;5 seconds;Fast moving, large red crescent object I was taking a few moments to look at the stars while on vacation and noticed a satellite almost directly overhead moving from approximately the NW to the SE at about 7:47 pm. I am not exactly sure of the direction but Jupiter and Antares were just right of center as I was facing almost due south.  Just a couple of minutes after the satellite passed, I noticed a large dark red crescent object pass in about the same area and direction as the satellite. It would have been about the same size as a first quarter moon. It seemed as if it was very high and passed very quickly. It seemed to have skipped through the atmosphere and could have been a fireball but was very dim and I have seen a number of fireballs and this did not look like any I have ever seen. It was only visible for a few seconds and covered the distance of about 1/5th of the night sky. If it were at a low altitude in the sky, the speed would be that of a jet fighter at mach speed. There was no sound, and no flash and no tail to the object.;36.9147;-111.4575
