The year was 1986.  It was August. I was in Page, Arizona at the Waweep campground.  My friend had gone back to CA as we had rented a car and I lost the keys in the lake. So I was alone and walking along Lake Powell.  A bald headed man attacked me.  He was trying to molest, or rape me.  He had me pinned down on the ground, half in the lake and half out.  I was looking up at the sky and saw what looked like two shooting stars. One of the shooting stars did what shooting stars do, Shot across the sky and disappeared, but the other one seemed to land at the end of the lake.  At this time I was thinking it was an amphibious airplane.  It started coming towards us and I could hear the wind pick up and getting stronger at what looked like a big ball of fog was coming at us.   Soon the bald headed man got up.  He was scared and rocks were hitting his back.  He ran up the hill and yelled at me we better get out of here. I looked at him and the ball of fog and decided I would rather go with the ball of fog.  So I started walking out into the water towards the ball of fog. Then it just vanished.  Just instantly.  The water and wind calmed down and it was quiet again.  I did not know what to make of this. I have not heard of many reports like this, but it seemed like it made a special trip down from the sky just to rescue me from this man. That is my one sighting.
