My son in law and daughter wittnessed a large teardrop shaped craft very low, almost 100 meters off the ground. They drove toward it, flashing their lights from their vehicle. The craft doubled it's height, and started to move west along the rail road tracks. The sighting was near a soon to be golf course in vail. Aprox 2 miles north of I-10 interstate. That area is in a depression or valley. As the craft moved west, 2 A-10 aircraft tried to follow it. It increased in speed and lost the A-10 aircraft. The color of the craft was a glow in the dark light green/white. It had a red light at pointed aft end. It was encircled with different colored lights around the perimeter. It made no noise during any movement. My daughter says that there was a dark area, like a windshield on the upper dome. My son in law is a electrician for a local company. My daughter works as a waitress at at a local steak house.;32.0027;-110.7053
