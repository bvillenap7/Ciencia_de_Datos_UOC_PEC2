Flashing Red & Green Object over Airport - hovers for several hours;2020-02-12 21:30:00;several hours;Flashing Red & Green Object over Airport - hovers for several hours The last couple of months we have been seeing an object that hovers over the Somerton Airport and the surrounding Cocopah Tribe Land.  It comes in almost every night at different times and flies back and forth slowly and then hovers for hours in different areas at a time.  I believe it is round with faint red and green lights that pulse.  There have been other similar objects on different occasions that fly by that one object at a faster pace or just hover next to it.  There is one that flashes bright white lights for a few seconds and then disappears.  I took a picture with my iphone of the one primary object but you can't tell what it is as it appears as a perfect round white bright light.;32.5594;-114.7133
