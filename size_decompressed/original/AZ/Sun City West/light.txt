White light moves erratically through Arizona night sky;2003-06-22 21:45:00;3 minutes;White light moves erratically through Arizona night sky I was visiting Sun City West, AZ on 6/22. Sitting outside on patio enjoying the warm clear evening, around 9:45pm, my night vision adjusted, not too much light pollution. I can see more stars than in the SF Bay Area. I said to myself I'm going to bag a UFO tonight.  Watched planes flying around the valley… all had blinking, or strobing lights. I kept watching for an aberration in the stars, i.e. anything moving erratically.  Looking towards East, a light enters my vision, a moving solid white, smallish pinpoint of light, not as large as say Mars, moving slowly my way. Another airplane I said to myself. Ah, what's this? It stopped moving. Now its moving again but swaying… swaying right, swaying left. It stops. It goes down (relatively speaking from my LOS), sways right, sways left, goes back up and continues on its pathway toward W. Now it turns, not a sweeping turn, but a sudden 90-degree turn. It does a maneuver around a fixed star (again relatively speaking), and continues on it way, now in the southerly direction. Eventually, it fades from my view.  Upon first glimpse I thought 'satellite'. But when it stopped dead in its tracks and started swaying, I knew I had bagged my UFO for the night. Amazing.;33.683;-112.3518
