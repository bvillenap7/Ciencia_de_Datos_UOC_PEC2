((HOAX??))  Large falling orb breaks into 5 smaller orbs and possible explosion.;2016-04-01 20:00:00;5 minutes;Large falling orb breaks into 5 smaller orbs and possible explosion. While taking my nightly walk I looked up and saw what looked like a massive pale orange ball falling slowly straight down in the sky.   It left a short trail and I thought it was a meteor, until it got to the horizon and exploded into 5 orbs which seemed to move in a controlled way.   They stayed equal distance apart and one was moving slightly up, they seemed to float for about 30 seconds and stayed the same distance apart from eachother.  They then fell below the trees and less than a minute later there was a flash as if they hit the Earth and exploded. ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to contact the witness by telephone, but her telephone does not have a voice mailbox that has been set up, yet.  Possible hoax.  PD));33.683;-112.3518
