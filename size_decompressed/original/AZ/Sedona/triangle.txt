Later 3 small triangular crafts, 8-10'wide, 10-12' alt. 45 sec. I was with a group of astronomers doing some star viewing through some privately owned telescopes.  Someone yelled and said look at that.  A huge, foot ball field sized, triangular shaped craft blacked out the stars.  It was silent, moving very slow (about 7 MPH) and only 50 feet or so over head.  There were lights at each point of the triangle.  We watched for about 20 minutes at which point it made a strange right angle manuveur and speed off.  Two military jets were chasing it.  About a week later I saw 3 triangular crafts manuvering through the mountains.  They were very small.  About 8 to 10 feet wide.  They were fast, silent, and very very low to the ground.  Not more than 10 feet above ground.  They were gone within about 30 to 45 seconds.  I have never heard of the little ones.  Have you???? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates indirectly that the date of the sighting in 2002 is approximate.  We have asked him to attempt to determine the date more accurately.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport,   Sorry to inform you but I am not a 'mister' (Mr.).  You guys sure took a long time to get back to me.  UFO activity must be getting really busy.    Well, lets see ............. This was about 4 years ago and I was never good with dates anyway, but I will do my best.  The astronomy club met on Wednesday evenings.  So in regards to the large craft, I can say for certain it was on a Wednesday night.  It was during the summer months and there was no moon.  You don't get good star watching when there is a full moon as it gives off too much light for star viewing.  So if you go back to the summer months of 2002 and look for dates on Wednesdays when the moon was not up between about 8:30 or 9 PM, that would give you a couple of dates to go from. I don't have the tools to research that.  No one logged this that I know of but there was at least 12 or 13 people there that night.  These were all scientists.  (They usually don't believe in anything).  In fact, the president of the astronomy club, (Sirius Lookers), was only annoyed that this thing blocked out the stars and interrupted his lecture and he had to wait for it to pass.  Strange but true!  In fact, that was even stranger than the UFO.   Regarding the small triangular crafts, well, that was also in the summer months of the same year.  It was just around sundown.  These small crafts were pretty strange in the way they maneuvered around the red rocks of Sedona, AZ.  It reminded me of Luke Skywalker on the craft he drove through the woods in 'Star Wars'. The crafts were black, made no sound and I saw no lights on them, but then it wasn't quite dark yet, if that makes any difference.  I don't have any idea as to how aliens think when it comes to putting their lights on.  They drove these crafts only a few feet off the ground.  I was alone when I saw the small ones.  I did not log them.   I'm sorry I can't be more precise.  However, I did get another photograph of a UFO over Hoover Dam in 1991.  I dated that one, wrote down the time and even the type of film I used, shutter speed and the whole banana.   If you're interested in seeing it we can make arrangements for that.   Through out my life, I have seen quite a number of UFO's.  I guess they just like hanging out with me. ????   Close encounters of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or whatever.  Name your number and I can probably come up with one.  I don't mean to sound flippant but that's just the way it is.    Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
A black triangle was seen flying over Sedona, AZ the evening of July 5, 2003 by six eyewitnesses;2003-07-05 23:15:00;2 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the three satellites, which are frequently seen flying in formation, are part of what is thought to be the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite program.  Satellites disappear when they fly into the Earth's shadow.  PD)) A black triangle was seen flying over Sedona, AZ the evening of July 5, 2003 by six eyewitnesses At 11:15pm on July 5, 2003, I and five of my coworkers were chatting on the balcony of a house our company is renting. I, being a stargazer and a former member of Arizona MUFON, was watching the sky when I saw a tiny orange-ish light moving in a southeasterly direction.  I called my colleagues' attention to it, thinking it was a satellite.  A female member of our group brought my attention to two more lights following the one I saw.  All were identically small and illuminated.  There were no conventional anti-collision lights strobing, only a faint but steady light from each.  I thought initially that it could not possibly be three satellites in a parallel formation moving at identical velocities.  Then the realization that we were having a bona fide UFO sighting occurred to me. The shape the lights formed were an elongated isoceles triangle - I would guess the three angles of the object were 30 degrees at the bow and 75 degrees for the two rear angles.  The object occluded the stars as it passed, leading me to believe it was a solid triangle, not a boomerang-shape.  There was no sound from it.  I would guess the object may have been moving at an altitude of at least 100,000 ft. and would have been over 1/2-mile in length. I ran upstairs to get my binoculars.  This took less than 30 seconds.  When I'd returned, the object was gone.  The manner in which it vanished, according to one of my fellow eyewitnesses, was it seemed to fish-tail like a car upon hitting a slick surface. The bow light then disappeared, followed by the other two lights.  It was described to me as it had gone through a rift or gateway in the sky. This is quite different than those objects that appear to suddenly vanish in a supposed hyper-jump. The object moved silently at what must have been supersonic speed to cover the distance it did in only a couple of minutes at great altitude, from initial sighting at almost 90 degrees directly overhead to 50 degrees to the southeast within two minutes. All of the witnesses, myself included, are in the performing arts, working with a Shakespeare company in Sedona.  Our ages range from 17 to 42. Four of the witnesses were male, two female. Myself and only one other witness in our group have any background or interest in such phenomena.  All in our group acknowledged, however, that the object was not a formation of airplanes, nor satellites.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448

I was facing N NE 34 51’52.16N 111 47’38.39W   elevation 4436 ft The object came from the NE directly NW till it was gone;2011-12-31 20:23:00;30-45 seconds;On New Year’s Eve, 31-12-2012, at about 8:23pm mountain time in the city of Sedona’s west side in Arizona USA I saw something in the night sky I have never seen before.  I don’t really believe in this- UFO’s, however, it seems to be other worldly.  I believe Less in the American media than I do in UFO’s so I have Been lead to this sight to describe what I saw in the hopes of keeping others informed. It was a huge brilliant blue triangular object traveling Very Fast across the horizon I was yelling at a friend and my son to look up in the sky.  To my dismay it disappeared leaving a big red ball of fire and two smaller red balls. At this time my friend and son were looking and two to three seconds later there was a sound as if something struck something.  My friend heard the sound but my son quickly dismissed it because in the opposing direction he saw fireworks declaring that must be the sound but my friend and I swore that the sound came from the direction I was looking in. Later that night, over the phone my friend and I did some internet research considering that it was a comet burning in the atmosphere. To my dismay, the news casters reported that several people called in saying they saw something in the sky. The reporters scoffed and joked saying it was space junk, or a falling satellite, or just people drinking too much. This is insulting and not believable. For starters, what I saw was brilliant and bright blue with a white glow. It was distinctively a triangle and moved faster than I ever seen from right to left leaving behind 3 red balls, one far larger than the other two. It was beautiful, nothing like I have ever seen. At the angle and height of the object it had to be bigger that 4 or 5 larger airplanes.  I haven’t seen anything this large I assumed it to be a meteor or a shooting star or Superman because it was a bright blue streak across the sky. LOL.  I joked that Superman was coming to rescue me.  My friend said I should make a wish. I feel comfortable to say my wish…it was for our planet and its salvation. I don’t know what I saw but I ran into people in my community the next day that saw it as well. I am calling it a meteor but the more I think about it the more I think it was other worldly, unique and beautiful. Definitely not space junk…This was not that. Just thought I would let someone else that may know hear what I saw. Thank you for reading this.

2 triangle shape amber colored UFOs, making a turn in unison, are witnessed by 7 ppl. in Sedona, AZ;2015-06-22 22:00:00;2 minutes;2 triangle shape amber colored UFOs, making a turn in unison, are witnessed by 7 ppl. in Sedona, AZ UFO Sighting on June 22, 2015 in Sedona, Arizona, at approx. 10:00 p.m.  Diagram of event at bottom of document. Filed by Melinda Leslie, Director of UFO Sighting Tours, Sedona. At approximately 10:00 p.m., or just before, my 6 clients and I (7 people total) were out on a UFO Sighting Tour with Military Night Vision Goggles when we all saw 2 large amber colored triangle shape objects with our naked eyes.  These traveled from the northwest area of the sky beyond Airport Mesa in a southward direction toward Cathedral Rock.  The 7 witnesses were standing together on Chavez Ranch Road turnout area.   The 2 objects then made an arching turn as they headed easterly toward the Chapel of the Holy Cross area and then disappeared to the North over Munds Mountain.   All witnesses were absolutely astonished and continued to discuss sighting event for duration of the tour. 4 of the witnesses clearly saw that these were 2 distinct structured, hard edged, dark triangle shaped craft each with 3 amber or orange colored lights on the bottom, one light at each corner.   Both craft were seen by the 4 witnesses with their naked eyes, without the Night Vision goggles.  2 other witnesses saw them at close range, but initially thru the goggles and could not make out the shape, only that they were huge lights.  One of these witnesses is a retired airline pilot with over 40 years of professional experience.  He stated emphatically that these 2 objects were remarkably faster than any plane he’d ever seen and that they were very low, much lower than commercial aircraft.  When these 2 witnesses lowered their goggles, they and I together saw that these were 2 very large amber colored lights, but unfortunately we did not see the distinct triangle shapes, each with 3 lights, as did my other 4 clients.  All 7 of us saw the 2 objects make an arched turn while banking and continued to watch them as they disappeared over Munds Mountain.  Please see the diagram below. Additionally, when these 2 craft were on initial approach, at the same time, a military jet at very high altitude passed over us and then another one did again as these 2 objects headed northeast.  All 7 witnesses commented that the 2 UFOs were considerably lower than either of the 2 jets.  It is difficult to judge the distance from us, but all the witnesses expressed that the UFOs were at most a few thousand feet, or less above us.  All 6 clients expressed that they are willing to be interviewed. Unfortunately we were so caught up in the event that none of us grabbed our cell phones to get a photo of the UFOs or take a video.  Darn it!  I did create a computer diagram drawing that I will email as instructed by you below.
