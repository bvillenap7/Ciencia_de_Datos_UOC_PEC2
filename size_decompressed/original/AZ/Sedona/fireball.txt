Object like a white fireball, with a short tail, hovering;1998-10-02 09:20:00;5 minutes;On vacation in Sedona, I was sitting waiting for a tour trolley to start about 9:20 in the morning when I looked up between two buttes to the northeast and saw an object like a white fireball, with a short tail, hovering between them.  It looked like a comet, only it was stationary for a long time.  I watched for about 5 minutes and took a couple of pictures.  Then it started moving, accelerated and moved from the upper right to the lower left and disappeared behind the saddle of the buttes.  A couple of minutes later I saw a jet.  It had a much longer tail. I am a supervisor with a state agency, have a college degree , and  consider myself to be a stable person.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
shooting star streaking all the way down to the ground and bouncing back up;2000-09-01 22:00:00;30 seconds;shooting star streaking all the way down to the ground and bouncing back up I was at a farewell party for a friend who was leaving town he lived near Red Rock Crossing in Sedona, and there were about 10 other people at the party. It was a beautiful, clear night, and around 9:30-10:00 pm, several people were out on the porch to watch the stars.  All of a sudden, we saw a shooting star streaking across the sky, but instead of burning up in the atmosphere, it streaked all the way to the ground and bounced back up from there! I've never seen anything like it before.   The event was witnessed by ca. 4-5 other people.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
EXTREMELY fast meteor-like object sighted above high thin overcast.;2012-09-22 20:30:00;1/2 second;EXTREMELY fast meteor-like object sighted above high thin overcast. Angular size: 1/8 degree or less.  Moved so fast it could not be accurately resolved. Track SE to NW, horizontal - spanning 15 to 20 arc degrees at 20 to 30 degrees above distant horizon. Appeared to be above high thin cloud cover – partially obscured - meaning above 10K AGL at least. Time of flight:  1/2 second or less.  Color: reddish white, no tail.  No sound. If this was an actual a meteor, was high strangeness event– unlike any I’ve seen before.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Two orange/red fireballs ascending in western sky.;2013-08-30 20:10:00;5 minutes;Two orange/red fireballs ascending in western sky. On back porch, facing due west.  Heavy cloud cover, ground fog.  Noticed an orange/red fireball rise in the distance.  Went and got witnesses, as we came back outside, the first fireball had risen a distance, and a second was emerging out of the ground fog.  Fireballs were rising at the same rate diagonal from one another. It seemed as if a large 'searchlight' was turned on and pointed towards the objects. 'Searchlight' stayed on for approx. 10 seconds. The fireballs kept ascending, the lower one that appeared second, disappeared behind cloud cover and lost sight of.  The first fireball, continues to ascend, enters clouds, and fades out of sight.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448

I just want to make sure that this was documented properly. I was driving on my Dirtbike up airport rd when I caught up to the car up the hill (it was a cop) I began to slow down. since he was going so slow I decided to look off into the scenery of West Sedona.   As I did out of the  corner of my eye their was a bright burning light came from the north eastern part of the sky roughly 5 degrees above the horizon. it looked like a IR Flare.  their was a commercial jet liner several thousand feet above it. just before burning out it puffed out white trail smoke.then pulled over at the top of the hill on the overlook and asked several people if they saw it as well. they confirmed it in color as well as direction.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Sedona, AZ, possible UFO sighting near 'Y' junction, inbetween two small mountain peeks which disappears without impact into thin air.;2015-08-28 06:27:00;4-5 seconds;Sedona, AZ, possible UFO sighting near 'Y' junction, inbetween two small mountain peeks which disappears without impact into thin air. At about 625-6:30 AM on August 28th, I was sitting at the bus stop on HWY 179, which has view of Airport Mesa.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a bright flash that caught my attention, and for the next 3-4 seconds after, I viewed what my logical mind first said was a 'meteor' or a 'downed plane.'  This was two hours after dawn, much too bright to see a meteor with the naked eye.  The object was glittering, metallic, and almost seemed as though it was on fire because of how lit up it appeared.  There was no smoke trail, or streak as it fell.  It was fluid and it appeared with the flash, and then fell in a downward arc, but disappeared before hitting neither the ground nor rock cliff. It was seen between two rocky, small mountain peaks, visible from where I was sitting to seem as though they were right next to Airport Mesa, but actually the rocks are best seen on HWY 89A, right after the 'Y' junction in Sedona, AZ, just past the post office. From my viewing perspective, the peeks seemed next to airport Mesa, so I called into the police suggesting a downed plane, but there was no smoke, and the object disappeared without impact. Thank you for reading this.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
