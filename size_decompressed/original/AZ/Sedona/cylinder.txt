((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  Objects are tiny, faint white specks, seen against a blue sky.  We have no reason to believe that they are UFO's.  However, they look like birds, in our opinion.  PD));34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Silver cylinder traveling slowly perpendicular to the ground.  Then vanished.;2017-07-01 14:30:00;45 seconds;Silver cylinder traveling slowly perpendicular to the ground.  Then vanished. I was sitting on my patio talking with a friend on the phone on a clear blue sky one afternoon.  Suddenly I saw a shiny cylinder which appeared to be 10-20 ft high and 20-40 inches in diameter.  It slowly moved across the landscape perpendicular to the ground, about 300-400 feet up from the ground.  It was as though it was scanning the landscape, which has spectacular mountain scenery and forest.  After watching it move across the landscape it suddenly vanished, as though it disappeared into another dimension.  It never returned. I am a scientist, a fact-based person.  This was definitely some sort of UFO or probe.  The memory of it is very vivid.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
