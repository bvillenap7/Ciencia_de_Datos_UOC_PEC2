Saucer shaped object sighted near Cathedral Rock in Sedona, Arizona in May,2002.;2002-05-29 19:00:00;6 min.;Saucer shaped object sighted near Cathedral Rock in Sedona, Arizona in May,2002. My new wife and I, on our honeymoon, observed a UFO on the night of May 29,2002.We were on the balcony of our hotel suite. I went out and noticed a saucer shaped light, engulfed in gold light,hovering near mountains and over the city of Sedona. I tried to sound calm when I asked my wife to come out to look at this object. When she did, I asked her if this thing had been here the last few nights. She said no. It was then that I noticed red and blue lights beaming from underneath the object. At that point, I ran to get a camera. When I ran back, my wife told me that the object just blinked out of sight like someone turned off a light switch. The next day went on as usual, but the morning AFTER that, my wife and I woke up to five large military helicopters flying over our hotel room and heading right to the spot in which we saw the UFO a day and a half earlier.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Elongated sphere with red/white strobing lights seen hovering over Airport Mesa in Sedona;2003-12-05 18:30:00;Approx. 6 minutes;Elongated sphere with red/white strobing lights seen hovering over Airport Mesa in Sedona Around 6:30 P.M., I was standing in my driveway and looked over toward Airport Mesa. I noticed  a disc or spherical object  covered with numerous red and white strobing lights hovering silently approximately 50-100 feet above the treeline. It remained completely stationary in that position for about 3 minutes after I began observing it. Then it slowly descended behind the mesa and out of view. A few seconds later, it came out from behind the mesa and drifted somewhat languidly toward the S/SW. Airport Mesa, incidentally, is purportedly home to one of the Sedona energy vortices. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what an energy vortex is, and we are not aware of any in Sedona.  PD));34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
What can I say.  Look for yourself!  This is not a a man made object.;2005-08-15 14:00:00;photo;What can I say.  Look for yourself!  This is not a a man made object. I just discovered the object when I used a picture from a trip to Arizona as my desk top photo and noticed the small disk in the photo when the picture was full screeen size.  i did not know I had photographed this object until january 2007.  I have cropped and enlarged the photo and I can not explain what I see! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Photo of UFO taken in Sedona AZ 3-24-08 4:13 pm;2008-03-24 16:13:00;less than a second;Photo of UFO taken in Sedona AZ 3-24-08 4:13 pm I took this picture on March 24, 2008 at 7:13 pm Eastern Time, making it 4:13 pm Arizona time.  We were parked on a small side road in Sedona, Arizona (with a sign that said “private residences” or something like that that my dad ignored!), just before the main road takes you to a large parking area.  We were standing in a small empty lot between two houses.  This picture was taken in between two other pictures taken at 4:08 pm and 4:16 pm.  The UFO image in this photo is not in the other two photos taken before and after.  Two other people with me were also taking photos at around the same time and the UFO is not in their photos, either.  None of us saw it with our eyes.  I took this picture with a Nikon Coolpix L12V1.0.  The picture has the following properties:  fstop – f/5.7 exposure time – 1/172 sec ISO speed – ISO-50 exposure bias – 0 step focal length – 6mm max aperture – 3.4 metering mode – pattern size – 3072x2304 300 dpi.  Very interesting, to say the least.  I’m very skeptical when it comes to UFO claims.  But this picture really caught my eye when I was scrolling through my photos after downloading them to the computer.  I couldn’t believe it, actually, and we all had a good laugh.  My family has been pressing me to report this for months.  I finally am doing so now.  After attempting to recreate an image with a UFO in it by putting a small fleck of paper on the lens, and also throwing rocks in the air to try to catch a snapshot of one of them to see if a similar image could be created, we couldn’t do it.  It didn’t work.  I don’t know what this UFO in my picture is, but I’m becoming more and more convinced it’s not a fleck of dust or a rock being thrown.  Maybe it’s a skeet?  I have no idea.  I don’t know if there are any skeet shooting ranges in that area.  Or maybe it’s an alien vessel?  Maybe we’ll never know.  I do know at this point it is truly an unidentified flying object – and perhaps an unidentifiable flying object at that!;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448

Did not see this by human eye. Downloaded picture to computer identifies definite disk shape and additional gold objects coming from the base of the mountain. The objects run parallel but not in a straight line. The objects appear to be lifting off into the sky with several objects appearing closer than others. Another photographer was taking picture at the same time, not of the same mountain, and did not catch the objects.

My wife went off by herself and I went off the other direction to take pictures. When we arrived home I reviewed my pictures and saw these objects in one of my pictures.  They weren't too clear so I asked her to view the picture on her Apple large screen.  Then she viewed her pictures of the same area but from a different angle and she caught the same thing this one if her picture. We could not see these objects with our eyes but the cameras picked them up. I'm not really sure what they are. I wonder if you have the ability to enhance this picture for better detail.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
