Around 9:30 PM, I was outside and heard an extremely load engine sound. It sounded like a plane, but much louder.   As it got louder, I looked through the sky and saw a horseshoe shaped object with red and green lights on the edges all the way around. In the center of the craft was a very bright white light and on both tips of the object there were more bright white lights. It was about the size of a football field.  And was only about 1,000 feet up in the air.  It continued across the sky, leaving town, but it disappeared instantly and the noise was gone, only leaving dead silence. This also occurred during a meteor shower, if that has any significance.  I left a message on your phone as well.  And I consider myself a skeptic and was blown away by what I saw.  I would've snapped a photo, but I was in utter shock at what I was looking at right above me.   I am emailing a sketch and diagram of what I saw, too.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
