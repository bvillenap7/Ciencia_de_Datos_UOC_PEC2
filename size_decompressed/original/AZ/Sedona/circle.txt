An organe sphere divided into 2 orange spheres or a 2nd one emerged from the first.  Each appeared the same in color, shape, and size.;2012-11-27 20:15:00;2 minutes;An organe sphere divided into 2 orange spheres or a 2nd one emerged from the first.  Each appeared the same in color, shape, and size. An orange sphere appeared suddenly over Mingus Mountain near Jerome Az about 20 miles west of sedona, az. Viewing through binoculors from approx. 10 miles east of the sighting, a 2nd orange sphere emerged from the 1st one and then suddenly dissapeared. This happened 2 times over a 30 minute period in the same location. The size of the object can't be estimated given the distance and low proximity to the top of the mountain. I would estimate that it was about 100-200 ft above the mountain.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
