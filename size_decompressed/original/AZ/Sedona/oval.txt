craft accompanied by two silent aircraft and followed by one loud aircraft;1998-09-21 19:40:00;20 sec;craft accompanied by two silent aircraft and followed by one loud aircraft lg. elliptical silent object with no light other than a peach colored haze went quickly across the sky SW to NE  accompanied by a silent aircraft at the upper rear and one at the bottom toward the rear. Each had one very bright flashing light but were silent. No details could be observed in the dark sky. These were observed while I was in the shower with no inside light and no outside lights on in the retirement community. I didn't notice them until they were more than half way across my field of vision. Ten minutes later when I stepped outside to look at the sky where they had been an aircraft suddenly zoomed by going in the same direction but lower in the sky with steady bright lights and making a very loud noise. Details of this craft also were not seen but there was a light at the front and one much lower and further back giving the impression a third light may have been on the opposite side thereby giving it a triangular shape.  This aircraft had much greater speed than the others.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
In a wooded area - Saw what appeared to be a figure - glowing - all white light - black straight eyes black diagonal/diamond strip o;2002-07-28 03:10:00;20 seconds;In a wooded area - Saw what appeared to be a figure - glowing - all white light - black straight eyes black diagonal/diamond strip of clothing on top nothing I have ever seen before I drew a picture of it - both of us stood there about 20 seconds I feel crazy sending this in - but I still see a vivid picture of the person every day.  Is there anyone that I could send the drawing to that could lend some information regarding what I saw?  Prior to seeing him I saw white lights (large oval with patterns) in the sky.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Dark stationary craft - hovering at about 1000 feet;2003-08-23 15:00:00;5 Minutes;Dark stationary craft - hovering at about 1000 feet Attn: Peter Davenport  Subject: UFO  Sighting Area: Village of Oak Creek (VOC), Sedona AZ   Dear Peter, (being I am 72-years of age I will address you as Peter instead of Mr. Davenport.)   This sighting took place in 2003 (the exact day is unknown but I believe it was on August 23rd).   The sighting was later verified as having been seen by two Mexican laborers I had working on my property. As you can see by the attached photos (jpegs) of which there are two (2) the sighting was photographed with an old digital camera close by the edge of a street in VOC and shows the same landscape with about a 10-feet difference.  I am sending you four jpegs of the sighting of which two are enlargements of the object in question. For your information, although I would prefer anonymity regarding what I am sending you, my wife and I are known artists, although 30 some years in the past I was, for 14-years, a trained US Army Special Forces NCO and worked in intelligence and communications under the command and control of the CIA.  The reason for my telling you this is that if there is an investigation it will not leave you hanging for a response.  Also, there is the fact that since 2000 I have video-taped a number of unidentified flying objects in and nearby VOC but enough of the past as this sighting was accidental as at the time my wife was photographing monsoon clouds to use in her paintings and we did not see the object until the photographs were downloaded onto our computer. Even then the object was thought to have been a speck of dirt or other material on the lens.  It wasn’t until I began enlarging the photographs that I sighted on the bottom left of the photo a red spot lighted area upon the ground and above, on the top left, a white spot lighted area on a cloud.  Reflected sunlight?  However, photo nr. two shows, on the bottom left, only a white spotlighted area on the ground.  Further enlargements of the black spot (see corresponding formation of sky surrounding the unknown object) piqued my curiosity when it showed an oval object that looks to be a person in side the object, standing before a vertical rectangular object (control board?).  I will leave it up to you as to what the object is and, if you find it intriguing, enlarge the object yourself. As for the Mexican laborers, they told me they had sighted the same object while changing a flat tire on their vehicle.  They also stated that the object had then approached and landed upon one of the Mesas in the background shown in my photos.  When they returned home and told their families they had been ridiculed so they hadn’t told anyone else other than their employer.  Later, while working upon a studio for me I showed the photos to their employer and he then showed it to the two men and they told me that the object was the same one they had sighted.  Unfortunately, I didn’t have the two men write down what they had seen and like the unknown day we took the photos I or my wife cannot provide any further information.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Oval shaped craft with multi-colored revolving lights in sky and stayed in same area for 2 hrs. ((NUFORC Note:  Star?? Sirius??  PD));2011-09-29 21:00:00;1 hour (still happening);Oval shaped craft with multi-colored revolving lights spotted in sky and stayed in same area for about 2 hours. This has happened many times now so I've decided to find a way to report it.It seems to be an oval shape but it hasn't gotten close enough to know for sure yet.It has 3 different colors that revolve around the object,the colors are yellow,red and green.  It stayed in the same place for about 2 hours and it is still going on right now.  We got the telescope out and confirmed that it is defiantly not an airplane or any type of craft we have seen before.  Like I said before this is not the first time that we've seen this it keeps coming back around the same area we've seen it about 3 times now.  Our neighbors even came out of there houses to look at it so we are for sure not crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  Sirius??  PD));34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
