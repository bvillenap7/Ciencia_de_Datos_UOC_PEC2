Orange Blazing Light over Rim of Mountain Northeast of Long Canyon.;1996-11-29 21:45:00;5 minutes;Orange Blazing Light over Rim of Mountain Northeast of Long Canyon. I got off work in Sedona around 9:30 PM at night and was driving my van North down Dry Creek Road and pulled off to the side of the road after Northwestern Slopes FootHills North subdivision to look at stars in sky. Toward the Northeasterly direction I noticed an orange blazing light over the rim of rocks and thought forest fire at first. The orange glowing blaze grew in intensity of color and brightness and then receded back over rim and faded completely.

Three round bright lights in triangle formation near Northern Slopes Foothills North.;1996-11-30 22:00:00;10-15 minutes;Three round bright lights in triangle formation near Northern Slopes Foothills North. On a Saturday night heading North down Dry Creek Road next to the Northern Slopes FootHills North subdivision off to my left hand side was a gravel pull-off area to the side of the road where I like to look at the stars.  I left the 1986 Old Dodge Caravan running, otherwise it had to be pop-started. Before I decided to get out and look around I saw out the window to my left 3 round white lights in a triangle formation with two round lights on top and a third centered below.  At first I thought construction workers at night, as there was a new subdivision with new construction and development equipment left at night. outside.  I did not see any construction workers about or movement of construction equipment or hear any such sounds. I felt very mesmerized by the three round lights at a nearby distance above the ground level. They stayed on bright white round and in a triangle formation very steady and not appearing to move at all.  I was expecting them to move....and entertained thoughts of them moving together in triangle formation or splitting off in different directions...which did not happen at all as I looked for what seemed to be a very long time straight on at the lights.  They seemed very, very bright and facing  toward the road and the van and me.  I was too afraid to get out of the van and walk around outside toward them, although I felt very compelled to do so...my van had problems starting and if I got out, then I would have to leave the van running...and I also feared the what if...what if I got out and my van stopped running or I felt fearful like I had to get back in the van and drive away quickly and it took too long to pop-start it back up and take off.  When these thoughts clicked in my head I decided I had been looking at these lights much too long, what seemed like 10-15 minutes and I did not want to see them anymore or entertain thoughts of them moving, turning off,  following me, etc. so I decided to quickly drive off away to my campsite in Long Canyon instead. I fel! t that I had come to the desert to live and challenge myself to face my fears...and I became too scared and drove off instead.

A very bright palsing light with smaller bright object flying around larger object.;1997-05-10 21:50:00;5-10 mins;Summary : A very bright palsing light with smaller bright object flying around larger object. We had just finished dinner in a outdoorsecond floor restaurant in Sedona AZ at 9:55 PMwhen one of our party pointed out a light that was20 to 30 degrees above the eastern desert ofSedona. The light moved slightly but pulsed inintensity from star brightness to very bright.A second smaller bright object seemed to flyoff and fly around the larger object with quickmoves above, below and around the large object.At times the small object would drop below thelarger in a falling leaf motion and fly backto the larger object becoming one object agian.We watched from the restaurant for 5 mins andgot into our car and drove to a better locationto watch the object. We parked on the cliff aboveour hotel. We watch this object carry on again foranother five mins before it just blinked out.The object seemed to be several miles away fromour location. No noise and clear skies in the Eastwith the moon to our backs.

Stationed on a small hilltop situated between the Secret Mountain Range and Mingus Mountain, near the Bradshaw Ranch, six people witnes;1998-01-30 20:00:00;5 hrs;Summary : Stationed on a small hilltop situated between the Secret Mountain Range and Mingus Mountain, near the Bradshaw Ranch, six people witness two very strange events: A blinking light of different colors appearing on the horizon, and two solid objects of unknown origin descending to the east. Three researchers of the investigative group Citizens for U.N. Base Disclosure planned an all-night long research event on the nights of Jan. 30th and 31st of 1998. In an area known for unusual UFO activity, the researchers set up their equipment on an isolated hilltop near the Bradshaw Ranch (which has been featured on the TV show Sightings). One man driving a Jeep Laredo, and a married couple in a Suzuki sport-utility eventually joined our party, and we built a camp fire as we gazed the night skies. The first sighting came at dusk, with a few stars beginning to show up. An object, descending from the east, was spotted. The object was bright white in color, approximately 10,000ft. in altitude, and about three times the size of Venus. It seemed to be a solid object. Adjacent to the object, at an est. distance of 1,000 ft. was a smaller object traveling synchronously with the larger object. We all witnessed these objects travel for about 1 minute, until they disappeared behind 6,500ft. Bear Mountain (3 miles to the east of where we were). The objects were very unusual, and did not look like any conventional aircraft. The second sighting was witnessed throughout the night: a bright light flashing numerous colors was seen low on the horizon near Camp Verde, a town about 15 to 20 miles south of our location. The light was quite clear, thus suggesting that it could not have been very far away (maybe 20 miles in distance from us). The light, when first seen, was moving up, and left and right slowly. Then it ABRUPTLY vanished. The light would then reappear in the same location...then it would eventually vanish. This activity went on throughout the night. The light simply was not an airplane due to the bright blinking colors it emitted, what's more, the light was not located near any known flight path for airplanes or near any known airport.

An extremely bright light appearedout the window lasting 10-15 minutes disappearing in a flash with no sound ever heard.;1998-08-10 21:30:00;10-15 minutes;An extremely bright light appearedout the window lasting 10-15 minutes disappearing in a flash with no sound ever heard. I was lying in bed watching T.V. with no other light on, all of a sudden the room was filled with extremely bright light even though the curtains were closed. The blinding white light was extremely scary. I as a 79 year old man (in extremely sound mind)had never experienced such a thing. I got out of bed and peered through the curtains and all I could see was extreme bright light so I grabbed my camera and took two pictures. While the light was bright no sound was being heard. After having the pictures developed, both pictures had the white light in them. I still have the pictures. The light appeared for approximatly 10-15 minutes. The light then disappeared in a flash, never hearing a sound.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Strange bright light blinking multiple colors west of Sedona near Secret Mountain;2001-09-04 22:15:00;20 min.;Strange bright light blinking multiple colors west of Sedona near Secret Mountain We witnessed a light that changed colors from Blue, red, yellow, and white.  We were on a dirt road near the Bradshaw Ranch and noticed as we were driving in its direction it slowly decended towards the horizon near Clarksdale.  When we stopped to witness what type of movenment it was making, it hovered for about 10 Min. Then suddenly it zig-zaged west to east and back again.  Thats when I realized for sure that this was a unconventional object.  It soon decended behind the mountain and was gone. It reappeared on the north side of town on our way back to Boynton canyon at much higher altitude and remained there for another half hour until we decided that it was time to goto bed and was seen from our hotel door at the Days Inn in West Sedona. It was the brightest thing in the sky and had to have been witnessed by other people in town.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448

It was a clear night and visibility was great. I was observing the moon and stars and noticed an airplane with its flashing lights on  headed in a southerly direction fairly high up furthur back along the same flight path it looked to me another plane was following at a normal distance. Suddenly something was flying down and took a position between the 2 at about the same altitude and direction it had no flashing airplane lights, it has like 2 half circle orange glowing sections underneath the craft seperated by a dark section running front to back as it flew.I really couldnt see the craft but the orange glowing areas were obvious.I watched as it followed the flight path of the first plane as they all three in a row flew off and faded from view headed south. Note of interest the phoenix news reported a strange fireball or explosion in the area there early the next morning. It was unexplained.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Bright object flying in circular pattern over West Sedona;2004-07-03 19:50:00;2-3 minutes;Bright object flying in circular pattern over West Sedona About half an hour before sunset tonight, I was out for my evening walk. As I was rounding the corner behind my house, I noticed an extremely bright object in the northern sky. It was roughly the size of a medium-sized pea held at arm's length, at what appeared to be a relatively low altitude, and gave off an extremely bright golden orange light, which would periodically dim, then brighten up again. The object was moving at a fairly high rate of speed in a circular pattern. After completing a little over 45° of the circle, it disapeared.  As far as I could determine, there was no sound associated with the object.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Shortly before 5 a.m., I awoke to the sound of one of my cats making noise upstairs.   ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus??));2004-08-30 05:00:00;2-3 minutes;Shortly before 5 a.m., I awoke to the sound of one of my cats making noise upstairs.  I got out of bed to go to the bathroom, and when I went back to bed, my gaze shifted to the view outside my patio doors.  In the sky, slightly above Wilson Mountain, I observed an extremely bright white light, which appeared to be stationary.  The luminosity of this light was exceptional, and looked exactly like the white sparklers kids use on the 4th of July.  The light was radiating out from a central point, in brilliant sparkling rays, just like a sparkler.  The light also seemed to pulse a bit, getting bigger and brighter, and then dimmer and smaller.  I was almost transfixed by it, it was so  extraordinarily beautiful, and I did not want to leave my observation of it, but I did want a photograph, and so I went upstairs to get my camera and shoot from the outside balcony there.  When I got upstairs the light was still there, but lower on the horizon, and closer to the top of the mountain.  My sense of it was that it would soon be gone, and I hurriedly grabbed my digital camera, went outside and observed it very close to the top of the mountain, and getting lower.  I took one shot, lowered my camera, and it was gone, so I do not know if I pressed the shutter in time, but my image is completely black, except for the wall of the balcony, which shows clearly.  This is unusual, because there was enough light in the sky so that the mountains should have been visible in the photo against the dawn sky,  but that area is completely black.  Something else unusual is that I do take very many paranormal photographs in which I do not see the lights and shapes that appear in my photographs, but this time, I saw a mysterious light, and the landscape in the image is completely black.  There was no noise from the light.  I looked at the clock on my kitchen oven, and the time was exactly 5:00 a.m.  This light was like nothing I have ever seen.  The color white was unparalled and pure, and it sparkled and radiated in such a way that it seemed to be intentionally wanting my attention.  That was the feeling I got from it, and I had a very hard time leaving it to go get my camera. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at Venus.

BALL OF LIGHT MOVED AROUND IN THE SKY, THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND MOUNTAINS.;2004-10-15 01:00:00;2 minutes;BALL OF LIGHT MOVED AROUND IN THE SKY, THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND MOUNTAINS. In October of 2004 I was hitch hiking to my favorite spot in Sedona AZ  to camp.  I had camped there the year before with some friends, and liked the seclusion.  I got dropped off on the main road and walked all the way in by myself to camp alone. The spot is just south of the city limits of Sedona, off of  highway 179 south.  There is a side road I cannot remember the name of you take east, and it follows a river. I was 18 at the time, and I guess I was very fearless, because I would be scared to camp there by myself now.  I did not believe in aliens at the time, to the degree that I do now. One night, while camping out on the river with not a soul around for miles, the weather looked like it was going to begin to storm.  I was sleeping on the ground, under a tarp out in the open.  I secured my tarp, and dug a trench around it to collect the rain away from my sleeping bag. Before it started to rain, I saw a very bright circle of light, that looked oddly close, and not outside the atmosphere, but rather inside it.  Sure enough, it start to move around, and vanished behind a mountain. I dropped to my knees in overwhelming fear.  Then the thunder storm came with loud thunder and heavy rain.  I remember laying there in paralyzing fear. Thinking back on it, I hope I wasn't abducted that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Looked similar to a light we saw the previous evening in the same city-different location.  The light zig-zagged from left to right-more so up and down and then disappeared behind the ridge only to keep reappearing about 5 times fading out (the light) then disappear for good behind the mountain ridge. We saw this through the night vision scope and the light was much more intense than any other star or planet in the sky.  Its movement, as seen through the scope, was clearly moving erratically compared to any other night objects such as stars,airplanes passing by,satellites etc. The same description would be given as we saw also saw this with our naked eyes.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448

AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRCRAFT APPROACHING THE COTTONWOOD AIRPORT, BUT THERE WERE NO STROBES AND IT DIDN'T CHANGE POSITION.  THEN I THOUGHT MIGHT BE A HELICOPTER HOWEVER, IT DIDN'T CHANGE POSITION.  I WAS TRAVELING 65 MPH AND IT REMAINED IN ONE PLACE DURING THIS TIME.  I HAD READ THAT THERE IS TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION POSSIBLE, SO I SENT A MENTAL GREETING AND ASKED TO BE SHOWN A SIGN IF THEY WERE WHAT I THOUGHT THEY WERE.  INSTANTLY THE LIGHT WINKED OUT.  THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY THAT NIGHT AND NO OBJECTS IT COULD HAVE DISAPPEARED BEHIND.  ALMOST INSTANTLY IT APPEARD AGAIN, FAR TO THE RIGHT OF WHERE IT HAD JUST BEEN, OVER THE TOWN OF JEROME.  I EXPERIENCED A DEFINITE FEELING OF CONTACT WITH SOME KIND OF INTELLIGENCE.  WISHED THEM WELL AND CONTINUED ON MY WAY.

I watched the three strange lights for about 3 or 4 minutes. I got the impression that these lights were quite low to the ground and closer than I had previously thought.  In a blink of an eye, the three lights formed a triangular pattern and began to move in perfect unison to the west towards the Prescott National Forest.  The triangle it formed blocked out the stars like a big black shadow.   Within seconds, the lights had disappeared.

I got up and got binoculars and viewed the object which appeared to be red, green, and white lights flashing in a circular pattern (unlike any aircraft I’m familiar with).  It was moving erratically from south to north, rising and dipping, and zigzagging left and right.  It seemed to be relatively high and briefly disappeared behind a mountain, only to reappear and ascend even higher in the sky as it moved farther north.

On the evening of Friday, May 8, 2020 in Sedona, Arizona, U.S.A. at about 2045 I was alerted by my wife that a brilliant light was up in the sky. I joined her on the deck of our home and spotted a brilliant white light in the sky to the ENE approximately 20-30 degrees above the horizon. The light was brilliant, steady, and emitted no sound. It remained motionless for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  I was observing this light through binoculars and called my neighbor on the phone (who lives about a quarter mile away). He, his wife, my wife, and I all watched this object until it blinked out shortly after 2100. My neighbor's wife called a friend who lives across town near the Poco Diablo Resort and she also observed the light except that it appeared to be in the sky to her WNW near the Sedona Airport mesa. This seems to suggest that the object was airborne to the north of the Sedona Airport mesa.  My neighbor and I are both pilots. I am a private pilot and aircraft owner. My neighbor is a CFII and owner of multiple aircraft.  Venus, the planet, was clearly visible in the west, opposite from the direction in which we were observing.
