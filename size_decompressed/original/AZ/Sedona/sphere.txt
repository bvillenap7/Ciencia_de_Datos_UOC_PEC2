Fire fight in the sky;1994-08-04 23:00:00;five minutes;Fire fight in the sky. On August 4th, 1994  around 10:30PM my husband and I were star gazing from the open upper deck of our home in Sedona, AZ.  It was close to a new moon so the sky was dark and we had a clear view of the evening sky. We were facing in the direction of  Cathedral Rock which would have been northwest of our home.  I first noticed what seemed to be a very bright star just to the west of Cathedral Rock and pointed it out to my husband.  Within minutes after we noticed  a white laser type beam came in from the east and hit this object which I thought was a star.  We could see the object flare at first and then about 20 seconds later it exploded causing a firework type of effect - sparks floating down.  There was no sound and we just sat there shocked at what we had just seen.  About an hour later we received a phone call from friends in West Sedona telling us that there was a fire going in Secret Canyon (west of 89-A), but they didn’t know much about it. We told them of what we had seen just a hour before and we all wondered if it might be connected. By morning the fire in Secret Canyon was quite bad, but because it is a very remote canyon the Forest Service decided to just watch the fire rather then try to fight it with water planes.  We went into town to a local coffee house and meet a few other people talking about the fire and the night before. One couple stated that about an hour before the fire was reported they saw a small flaming object fall into Secret Canyon and they thought that was the cause of the fire. That would have been right about the time that we witnessed the explosion in the sky. The people of Sedona watched this fire burn for ten days, many sitting for hours at night on Air Port Mesa looking out over Secret Canyon.  When the fire finally began to reach the area of resorts in Oak Creek Canyon the Forest Service decided to fight the fire. In itself this story doesn’t sound like much in the way of a UFO report, but at that time in Sedona many locals were aware of something strange in Secret Canyon, and another area, because many hikers into that area had been turned away by military type men in black uniforms with M-16s to back them up. There had even been two off duty police officers hiking there  that had been turned back and told to not return. After the fire was put out the whole canyon area was closed off for about 3 months and many trucks were seen going into that area. Many of the locals at that time felt that there might have been some type of aerial fight between two “UFOs” and the one shot down fell into Secret Canyon.  Many of the locals were talking about it and many tourist over heard and asked questions - and then a few days later some of the locals working in the shops had visits by men dressed as tourist in dark sunglasses. I was one of those locals, a man entering the shop and came “nose to nose’ with me and said, “I hear that you know a lot about UFOs, tell me about them”.  I knew exactly what that was all about and said nothing and the man left. There were enough locals afraid after that to just remain quiet.  One local rancher had already had much trouble from different government agencies because of UFO reports he had made and so it put the locals on pins and needles. There is a LOT that has, and still does, go on in this area revolving around UFOs and alien life forms - people just don’t talk openly about it anymore ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

It was a little north of where we were... Bright red pulsing orb appeared on horizon... we watched it float across the sky, and then it started doing the anti-grav manuevers: 90 degree zigzags, really quick! I was visiting Sedona because I had heard it was a UFO hotspot... After 27 years of waiting, it was nice to see one... It inspired me to undertake an independent video documentary project about UFOs... Coming from what I believe to be a fresh Gen-X perspective, its almost finished, and I will soon begi9n submitting it to the film&video festival circuit... I also later learned that 4/1/97 was the perehelion of the Hale-Bopp Comet!;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
saw a huge yellow moon rise over the Red Rocks, then found out it wasn't the moon at all;2000-04-15 23:00:00;2 minutes;saw a huge yellow moon rise over the Red Rocks, then found out it wasn't the moon at all I was driving home at night on Hwy. 89A and saw, coming up behind one of the Red Rocks, a huge full moon.  It was an amazing sight the moon was as big as you usually only see it in the Caribbean or on faked photos, just absolutely humungous. But then, as I came closer, the moon went back down behind the Red Rock it had risen from. I attributed this to an optical illusion and turned onto Hwy. 179, which intersects the 89A at a nearly right angle.  As I drove on, I suddenly saw the REAL moon (which was a lot smaller) in front of me, on the opposite side of the sky from where I had seen it.  In other words, what I had seen was NOT the moon, but I have no idea what it was.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
silver sphere sighted in sedona;2000-08-19 16:00:00;5 seconds;silver sphere sighted in sedona my girlfriend saw a silver spherical object pass behind a rock formation today around 4 to 4:30pm. she is a serious skeptic, but exclaimed when she saw it: now that looks like a ufo!. the object passed behind a rock formation before i could catch a glimpse of it. ((NUFORC Note:  An update submitted by same witness.  PD)) an update on the sighting of a white falling fireball over sedona- the most logical explanation of what i saw is probably the dropping of an iridium flare, although this fell much faster than the 'iridium flares' that were given as the explanation of the famous phoenix lights. ((NUFORC Note:  An Iridium flare is caused by the reflection of sunlight off the flat solar collectors on an Iridium satellite.  The term, Iridium flare,  therefore, refers to a sudden illumination from an orbiting satellite it does not mean a burning object.  PD));34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448

Shortly before the Villlage of Oak Creek my 10 year old son who was in the back seat said What is that thing in the sky?.  I said it was probably a plane but he seemed insistent so I strained my neck to look where he was pointing.  At that time I noticed what appeared to be a shiny metallic-like object that seemed to be halfway between a round and disc shape.  It was high in the sky, about where a small plane would normally fly.  It was not moving, just hovering.  As the road I was on is very winding I couldn't keep my eyes on it for very long at a time.  My son, however continued to observe it for at least 4 minutes.  It didn't appear to do anything except hover high above the rocks until I looked up the last time.  Then it appeared to get physically smaller and smaller over a period of about 15 seconds until it completely disappeared.  Shortly after this I stopped in the Village of Oak Creek to get a coffee, all the while marveling with my son over what we had just seen.  After about 5 minutes we proceeded to get back on the road at which time my son said There is is again.  It had moved position slightly and seemed a bit lower this time.  A jet plane flew almost directly over it at that time and it gave us a bit of perspective as to the size.  It seemed to be about a quarter of the size of a large plane.  Once again, it just hovered and did not make any movements. (or sound that we could tell)  We continued to watch it for another 3 or 4 minutes (myself in between looking at the road of course)and because of the enormous rocks and cliffs around Sedona we then lost sight of it.  UFO sightings around Sedona are known to be a bit common.  I have personally seen many strange lights in the night sky but have never seen anything during the day. I am a professional singer in Phoenix but I also work at a mortgage company in Sedona during the week.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Bubble visitor(s) in Sedona?;2004-05-30 17:00:00;1 minute;Bubble visitor(s) in Sedona? While waiting for dinner to cook, 3 adults talked on the patio of a Forest Service house above Oak Creek.  A clear bubble about the size of a quarter came floating up the path, and twice bumped into rocks without breaking.  Then it landed in the grass, and again without popping.  Two of us moved swiftly towards it to examine it, and it took off at high speed, negotiating between to fence boards, and disappeared.  One of us is a social worker, one a family therapist, one a retired electrician.  None of us drink or use drugs.  We thought there must be a natural explanation for this, but have been unable to find anything that resembles what we saw.  It was suggested we contact you.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Florida husband and wife videotape UFO in Sedona Arizona while on business trip.;2009-07-19 00:00:00;30;Florida husband and wife videotape UFO in Sedona Arizona while on business trip. Husband and wife walked out onto their hotel balcony in Sedona Arizona at night, and saw a stationary UFO.  They were at 5,000 ft above sea level.  The UFO never changed positions, until it left. When it left, it slowly disappeared as it backed away.  As the video is panned briefly, you can see some of the house lights that were on the adjacent mountain area.  The UFO looks like a plasma ball in the video, constantly rotating and changing colors.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
