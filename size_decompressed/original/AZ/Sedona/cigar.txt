1-2 mile long cigar shaped craft over Sedona, Arizona.;2012-03-01 20:30:00;10 minutes;1-2 mile long cigar shaped craft over Sedona, Arizona. UFO Sighting Report  On Thursday, March 1, 2012, at about 8:30 PM, I was in Sedona, Arizona, and looking west from the town toward the city of Cottonwood about 17 miles away, and more distant mountains behind that.  I heard a vague sound which gradually increased in intensity over a few minutes.  It sounded something like a propeller-driven aircraft, but increased in intensity to become much louder and lower pitch than any aircraft sound I had heard before. I looked up to try to locate the source of the sound, and noticed three red lights, like the typical wing lights on the left wings of aircraft, moving from my right to my left, toward the south.  They appeared to be about 2000 feet above ground level, and moving very slowly.  Then I noticed they were all in exact linear alignment, equally spaced, and moving as one unit.  Then I noticed there were no other lights, green, white, etc., visible, and that the stars were blacked out in the entire area between the lights and slightly above the line they created.  Immediately below the line of the lights, stars were visible, but not immediately above, so that is apparently where the body of the craft was, but it was completely invisible, appearing non-descript opaque black. The craft continued moving from north to south, moving very slowly, what would normally be too slow to maintain altitude, and eventually disappeared into the south, toward the city of Phoenix. I would be very interested to know if anyone has any idea what this was.  The length of the craft appeared to be about 1 to 2 miles.  Not the typical size of normal aircraft, and no blinking wing lights.  The three red lights were constant.  And it was certainly not silent, and I thought UFOâ€™s were usually silent.  So I have no idea what it was.  But there is no doubt it was there, this was not a vague or distant sighting.  I have been a private researcher for the last 40 years in the health field, and am qualified as an observer to be as objective as possible. Any input would be appreciated.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448

The object was stationary, then moved up, down farther quickly.  It then moved side to side and abruptly departed up and to the right in a very very rapid pace.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
