When i went to check out the window, there where no clouds, so it couldnt have been lightning, and i did notice a strange glowing silver aura off to the west over the mountain range.

Weird loud engine noise flying over my house sounded like a slow garbage disposal;2013-01-07 04:30:00;10 minutes;Weird loud engine noise flying over my house sounded like a slow garbage disposal Around 4:30 a.m. today, I was inside my house and heard an extremely load engine sound flying over my house.  It sounded a little bit like a plane, but much much louder. It sounded more like a garbage disposal in slow motion flying overhead.  Very eerie.  It was something flying over my house and although not 100 feet above, still very low flying. It came from the direction of the airport and was passing overhead.  This engine noise I heard was in the sky.  It flew over my house and overhead in my general vicinity for a bit. I grew up living near an airport for many years and know the different sorts of sounds airplanes and helicopters make, including when there is engine trouble. I know what the sound a military helicopter and jet sounds like, and today the sound I heard was not anything I have heard before and it stayed in the area around my house flying in a strange pattern.  This sound stayed overhead in my neighborhood after it continued away from my house. It is freezing outside and I was cold in my house...no heat on in the rest of the house, except in my bedroom. I did not know where my coat was and had to stay inside.  If I hear this again, will be ready to go outside and look!!! If it is daylight, I will get a picture too!  It went back and forth over my house area in the sky for about 10 or 15 minutes.  I could hear it very very loud flying over my house and nearby.  The noise was not so loud after 10 or 15 minutes or so, but I could STILL hear it flying loudly in the nearby neighborhood over the city.  I have heard the noise that sounds like an explosion here in Sedona about 5 or 6 months ago. I know of one other person who reported seeing and hearing what I am reporting today and the report is dated 12/20/12 on NUFORC.  This person reported seeing the craft, I only heard it.  BUT, I have heard a similar, non-airplane, sound about 2 months ago over my house and it went slow like a helicopter travels...this loud sound was very different-like a garbage disposal in slow motion and very very loud. I was in shock listening and was so cold..so, I did not go outside.  I know that there are people awake here at this hour and I hope someone reports this also.  One of my cats came over to me and sat up with a quizzical look on her face and she appeared to listen with me for as long as I heard this sound!  Sorry, no other witnesses, only my cat!!!  The last time I heard something similar to this sound flying overhead was in California where I grew up and it was about 12:30 at night.  When I went outside, I did hear the initial first loud sound I heard flying over my house for a few seconds, but after a few seconds it stopped.  I stood waiting and watching the sky over my house for about 10 minutes.  I then saw a light flying over the area near my house and it was moving very fast..about 5 minutes later, I saw two air force helicopters and they came flying toward my area very fast. The two military helicopters moved into a position where they were facing each other and turned lights on so light it was almost blinding (it was at midnight) and stayed in mid-air for about maybe 15 minutes in this position as if they had something between them they could see, but I could not.  The light I saw before they came flew toward the area the two helicopters were hovering over and before the helicopters arrived, the light disappeared.  The military helicopters are very very loud, however, the sound I heard today and the sound I heard then over my house was much much different.  I awakened a friend who lived 2 houses away and she witnessed seeing the helicopters come and get into the position I just described.  The military helicopters stayed in this same position for about 20 minutes or so.  The sounds of their engines were deafening.  I cannot believe anyone else in my neighborhood could sleep through this noise!!! My friend and I were the only ones who witnessed or! heard what I am reporting in California. I have seen other UFO craft when I was younger. I know what I heard flying over my house today is not an airplane or helicopter or anything that is explainable because of the weird loud sound it made.   The loud sound I heard this morning was very very loud and the closest description of the sound I can think of would be a grinding garbage disposal (in the sink-an insinkerator) in slow motion.    I hope somebody else heard and saw what I heard and reports it here.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
flahsing red green and yellow, strobing white lights.;2013-09-28 21:00:00;1 hour;flahsing red green and yellow, strobing white lights Facing west saw bright object flashing red, green and yellow.  It didn't seem to be moving but we noticed within minutes we had to keep moving back to see it as it was going lower in the horizon.   As we decided to get in the car and get a better look from up a hill, we saw another of the same objects as we faced north again,lower in the sky.  We drove for about 10 minutes and parked with strong binoculars.  The westward one started flashing strobe-like bright white lights and the inside stayed red.  The lights got very bright.  We watched for 15 minutes and the strobing stopped and it slowly faded away.  The one in the north continued to flashing the red green and yellow but never strobed.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
Lights and entities in Northern Arizona.;2016-08-22 20:00:00;2-3 hours;Lights and entities in Northern Arizona For 3 to 4 nights I observed amber lights emanating from what appeared to be 3 large windows up on Wild Horse Mesa which is behind my house to the east (I watch sun and moon rise over it).   On the 22nd of August I decided to put my cell phone camera lenses on top of the eye piece of a small table top telescope and attempt a shot.  When looking directly through the telescope I had real good detail of the windows but saw no movement or entities.  I shot a small sequence of pictures and the went back to zoom in and see what I had.... well the one picture I will provide was astounding to me to  say the least.   Last night - 8/25 - the light from the area on the mesa had gone from bright amber to a dim grayish blue but seemed to have increased in size/area.  Never seen anything like it and this will be my 1st ever report.  Thanks;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
