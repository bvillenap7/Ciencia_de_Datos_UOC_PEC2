Chevon shaped object flaming at each tip falls to earth north of Sedona, Arizona.;2007-08-27 21:22:00;2 seconds;Chevon shaped object flaming at each tip falls to earth north of Sedona, Arizona. At approximately 21:22 tonight I was pulling into my driveway which faces almost due north when I watched an object fall at about a 2 to 3 degree angle to the west from it's first observed position.  I live to the north of uptown Sedona, Arizona and my house sits on the edge of the Coconino national forest with only dwarf juniper and pinion forest behind my home.  I am just south by about half a mile from the base of mount Wilson in an ever rolling series of elevations.  As I watched this object there were long trailing flames coming from each end of the unidentified thing.  I was paniced by the sight of this as it looked possibly like a plane in that it was somewhat chevon in shape with the flames coming from each of the tip points and the apex was pointed in the direction of the fall. It took about 2 seconds to fall out of sight.  I first noticed the object at about mid point on the horizon and watched it fall directly behind Brins Mesa which is about a mile to the northwest of our home.  There was no noise or blast from an impact.  However, in the area of the trajectory there were pluming clouds that seem to come from the point were the object would have made contact with the ground.  There were no other clouds in the sky.  At an arms distance it was about the size of a nickel to a quarter.  I have lived here for about 5 years and been witness to many meteor showers but none have ever looked as strange as this object.  It obviously had a span between the flaming ends just as an airplane would have from wing tip to wing tip.  I did not see a fuselage or tail section.  It was more like a flying wing.  I did not call the police.  The flames and total comprized color of said object was bright white.;34.8200413793103;-111.756593103448
