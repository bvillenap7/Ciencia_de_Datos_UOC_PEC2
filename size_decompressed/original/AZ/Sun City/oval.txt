I may have been outside 5 minutes looking to the west i could see the moon and Venus clearly.  I decide to take a picture on my cell phone and after I stood and watched the skies for a short time there after.  I never saw the object at any point it was only after going back through photos on my cell phone did I discover  that the object was there May 27 2020.  I went on line to see what the skies were like as far as planets available in that part of the sky visible at that point on Apr 25 2020 only Venus was up and of course the moon...again I did not see any movement from my perspective left to right or right to left or vertical up or down...and had my see toward that part of the sky for at least another 5 or so minutes after taking the picture before going in the house.;33.6285827586207;-112.297510344828
