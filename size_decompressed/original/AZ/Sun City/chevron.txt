Video on bright amber lights in Flight Path of Luke Air Force base 03/15/2001;2001-03-15 19:42:00;4 minutes;Video on bright amber lights in Flight Path of Luke Air Force base 03/15/2001 Hello Heard your program on Jeff Rense 3/16/12 - I have a video and have seen lights on 3 occasions within a 1 week span.  I can pretty well tell how big and how far away and how high the objects were because the lights were in front of the white tank mountains which are 15 miles away so they had to be no farther than that.  They were about 1000 ft. above the ground and about 3/4 mile wide.  This location is in the flight path of Luke Air Force base.  There were 5 amber lights a bit smaller than a full moon.  They were stationary for a few minuites then two lights went out and the 3 middle lights rapidly moved upward in a north direction (on video) - then the lights got closer together as they were moving away, as if a craft were turning making the lights closer together but appearing to be not same distance apart.  I have seen (no video) much vivid detail on two other earlier occasions. Sorry I didn't report earlier as I assumed so many others did.  I was 61 years old at the time and both me and my wife saw them. Thank You;33.6285827586207;-112.297510344828
