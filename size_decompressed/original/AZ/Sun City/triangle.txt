I saw an orange upside down triangle in the sky.  It began to turn around so that the peak was upright and it had orange lights on it.   After it turned around I saw 5 bright rather large lights around the lower side of the object and it began to settle to the ground or over the horizon, I'm not sure which.   Shortly before it disappeared I saw a jet flying in the area.   My home is near Luke Air Force base. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
