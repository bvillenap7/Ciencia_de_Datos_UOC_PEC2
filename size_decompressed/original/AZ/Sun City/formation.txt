The color changed to red, orang-ish, seemed to be in the formation of a circle or oval, from the light blue to the reddish color back and forth .  Saw just north of where I am in sun city, maybe 5 miles north.  At first was very low,  and circled for about 6 minutes, then travelled East , I lost sight of it 10 minutes in ..... I have seen this before, and now I am positive it is not human aircraft , at least not the kind any division will admit too . WAY BIZZARE ! It swormed  for a few mintues in every location it went ... As if it was searching for something  .... Almost looked like a jailbird, but I know for a fact it wasn't.  That's how low it was . ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the same object reported by the news as a probable meteor.  We agree.  See photos of smoky trail left high in the sky above Arizona.  PD));33.6285827586207;-112.297510344828
