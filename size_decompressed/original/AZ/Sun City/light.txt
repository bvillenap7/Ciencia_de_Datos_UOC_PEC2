A Single White STRING light;2001-02-26 20:30:00;20 seconds;A Single White STRING light My Uncle and I were visiting family in Sun City, AZ. We were outside around 8:30P.M. looking at the stars, and saw a very long streak of white light. Sorta like a string. Just one. It looked like it was just floating in the sky. We tried to strain our eyes to try to figure it out. Then it just got too far away and dissapeared. We only saw it for about 20 seconds. A few minutes later, about 5 military jets from Luke Airforce base, flew by above.;33.6285827586207;-112.297510344828
Circles of light meet and separate in a distinct pattern;2006-10-05 20:30:00;about 30 min.;Circles of light meet and separate in a distinct pattern My husband came in the house after being outdoors at 8:30 pm. He said Hurry out. I came out and looked up at the sky. There were 4 balls of light/translucent kind of, coming together and separating. They all had their own specific circle and then they all met at the center, coming together, to separate and do the process again. Like a dance. On the right handed side of the sky, to this event, there were 2 other circles of light, not in this pattern, but just circling in their own pattern, near each other. THere were clouds in the sky, but these weren't clouds dancing!! Myhusband has seen this (but not this particular pattern) twice before within the last year, in late July/August and before that, maybe in the winter months. Very playful, not scary or frightening at all.;33.6285827586207;-112.297510344828

I walked out, and he pointed to a bright spot in the sky, NE of Sun City.  It was a white-yellow round spot, the size of a dime.   We both said it was too big to be a star or a planet.  A satellite would be higher in the sky.   I got the binoculars and we both tried to see it closer, but could only see light.  The object was completely still, no sound, no movement.   As a thin layer of clouds moved in, the lighted object began to dim, and 15 minutes later it was completely gone.;33.6285827586207;-112.297510344828

They would do this 3-5 times and appeared to travel in a straight line, however, that line could be horizontal, diagonal or completely vertical.  Shortly after the occurrence a group of four Air Force jets from flew through the area and proceeded North, then circled the rest of the metro Phoenix area and headed back to Luke AFB.  I am unsure how or if these are related.;33.6285827586207;-112.297510344828
