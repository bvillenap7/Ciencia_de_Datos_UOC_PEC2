Orangish-red circular object seen north of Sun City AZ;2016-05-28 09:00:00;1 hour;Orangish-red circular object seen north of Sun City AZ On May 28th, 2016, I noticed an orangish-red circular object in the sky north of Sun City, AZ.  My first thought was that it was a planet until it movedâ€”not very much and slowly.   This object stayed there for an hour while I watched it and was still there when I went to bed.  I was wondering if anyone else had noticed this object.;33.6285827586207;-112.297510344828
