Small white light seen hovering above Superstition Mountain.;2014-03-12 14:30:00;30 seconds;Small white light seen hovering above Superstition Mountain. At approximately 14:30 MST, a small bright light could be seen hovering above the highest peak of Superstition Mountain.  The light was very concentrated, and seemed to be circular.  It was a white light.   For about 20 seconds it remained in the same spot, but it was not completely stationary. It did move up and down and side to side very slightly.   Then, all of a sudden, it was was both lower and slightly further to the east, but still remained above the highest point on the mountain.  It remained visible for about 10 more seconds, and then was gone in the blink of an eye. I am a 3rd year student in the fields of meteorology and astrophysics, and I storm chase and star gaze fairly frequently.  I am very familiar with atmospheric phenomenon, but this was something I could not identify or explain.   Thinking it was a bird at first, I then realized I was way too far away to be able to see a bird above the mountain.;33.3284;-111.3502

Huge ball of light zoomed over Gold Canyon;2021-06-20 21:10:00;1 second;Huge ball of light zoomed over Gold Canyon There was a giant ball of white light that travelled from SE to NW so fast that you would’ve missed it if you blinked. It would’ve been traveling thousands of MPH. The object was a huge glowing ball, relevant to the size of maybe 20+ airplanes put together. It was so bright it was hard to look at. It zoomed right over the town, and then it was as if it hit an invisible wall and just disappeared. There was no tail or trail behind it, it did not fade out or disperse, it was just a giant ball that zoomed across then was gone as fast as it was there. No sound was made.;33.3284;-111.3502
