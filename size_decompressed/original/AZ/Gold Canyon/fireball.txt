Fire balls in the sky in AZ;2006-03-01 20:00:00;1 hour +;Fire balls in the sky in AZ I saw a fire ball in the sky hovering over what appeared to be the San Tan mountains in Arizona.  This was not my first sighting of these fire balls, so I knew to watch and wait to determine whether or not it was a military flare. This fire ball stayed illuminated for several minutes, then disappeared, slowly flickered out. Then, two minutes later, it reappeared in the same spot.  I drove home and got my camera..unfortuantely, I didnt fetch my tri pod. I found a nice dark spot to park and got out of my car and immediately,,, in the same spot as the first one was hovering,,, there were two! I took several photos.. of which I'd be more than happy to share. Because I didnt have a tri-pod, some of the photos have light trails. The last light I saw  was the weirdest of all.. while observing three lights hovering in the sky, a white light appeared, Dim at first the getting progressively brighter, then it appeared to split into several small lights that sparkled so brighly that I had to turn my eyes away. When I looked back to snap off another picture, it simply put, flew at high speeds, across the sky, so fast that I couldnt follow it. Then it was gone. There was one more hovering fireball that I observed, but I had children at home, and had to leave. This light show may have gone on all evening,,,, no telling.;33.3284;-111.3502
