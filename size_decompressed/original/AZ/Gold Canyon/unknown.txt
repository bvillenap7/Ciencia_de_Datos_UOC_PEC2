Amber lights hovering over Apache Junction, AZ as seen from Gold Canyon, AZ;2005-09-09 21:30:00;one hour or so;Amber lights hovering over Apache Junction, AZ as seen from Gold Canyon, AZ Two Amber colored lights low on the horizon appeared to be hovering over the Apache Junction, AZ Area. People on the ground out there seen them too for they were firing small fireworks in the general area of these crafts.  They lights hung there for about 15 minutes, without movement, no sound, no change. Then, the light to the left dipped low, as if it were a plane and it were banking to make a turn. And then the lights just dimmed out. They were gone.  About 20 minutes later, they were back, only this time they were lower in the sky. Again, the folks on the ground out in that area were lighting off fire works (not the large profession kind, a much smaller version of them). This time the lights stayed on for about 10 minutes and just dimmed out and disappeared. Again, unwaivering and without sound. I was able to take a photo of them.;33.3284;-111.3502

Thought it was a satellite until it took a deep plunge (about thumb's length), leveled off and traveled west, rose sharply to approximately half the elevation as before, leveled off traveling west, made another sharp plunge, rose in elevation once again and hovered with small movements, and then traveled west.  I lost sight of it in the night glow of Phoenix. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.3284;-111.3502
