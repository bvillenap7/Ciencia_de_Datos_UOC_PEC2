Glowing all-orange orb hovering over my subdivision;2018-03-08 18:50:00;2-3 minutes;Glowing all-orange orb hovering over my subdivision Thursday 8 March 2018 - Gold Canyon AZ - approx 6:50 pm.  I was driving N on Mountainbrook Dr. into my subdivision.  I noticed a bright orange glowing orb hovering over the houses.  It was about at the same height as one of the small mountains in the background (the Superstitions).  It was not moving at all & was low enough that this was easily discernable.   I stopped my car and groped for my phone - i watched it as i exited the car, but by the time I got to the curb it had already begun ascending straight up into the air - then just disappeared.  On this part i could be wrong but it almost appeared as if there were a closed net hanging from the orb.  It disappeared before i could get a picture.  I returned to the car and drove home - all the while keeping an eye on the sky. The western sky toward Phoenix was just turning dark. There was light cloud cover over the entire area;33.3284;-111.3502
