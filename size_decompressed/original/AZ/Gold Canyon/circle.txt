Circle of Red Lights;2003-11-01 01:00:00;Several Minutes;Circle of Red Lights While driving home from work one night I saw 6 to 8 red lights in a circle about 20 feet above a small hill. There are no building or other structures on this hill or trees.  There was also no sound. The object was there the entire time as I drove by. I was so surprised that I nearly came to a complete stop. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.3284;-111.3502
Object in night sky changed shape and emitted red/green lights.  Seen 11 objects in the sky.;2014-10-19 00:15:00;4 hours;Object in night sky changed shape and emitted red/green lights.  Seen 11 objects in the sky. I seen the object over Rattlesnake Hill first.  It hovered for about 40 mins in that area.  I thought at first it was a helicopter.  I live in an HOA that has low lights, and after dark there are no lights out here.  After so much time elapsed and no sound I knew what it was.  Then for about 3 mins it changed shape and became oblong and red/green lights appeared and it looked like a Ferris Wheel.  I got out my binoculars and seen that it was pulsating light.  Bright light.  Then I looked around the sky and seen another 4 objects doing the same thing.  Bright light, red, green lights.  After 1 hour the object began to move West and hovered around for another 3 hours.  Then I seen another two objects over Superstition Mountain.  I began to scan the sky and seen at least 11 objects also pulsating light.  I also witnessed more than 12 shooting stars in the night sky.  Were they shooting stars or objects moving so fast it looked like it?  I don't know for sure.   But this was the best experience I've had seeing objects in the sky.  I already knew that we are not alone in the universe.  This just confirms it.  I know what I saw and the other people with me witnessed it as well.;33.3284;-111.3502
