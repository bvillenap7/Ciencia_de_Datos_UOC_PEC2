Humming noise and yellow lights - illuminated my walls;2004-05-31 00:00:00;10seconds;Humming noise and yellow lights - illuminated my walls I was awakened approximately at midnight to a loud humming noise which I knew was not a helicopter, vehicle or airplane I looked at my bedroom wall and saw distinctive, bright, yellow lights - illuminating my room.  I felt I was coming out of a dream, but realized it was REAL.  By the time I got out of bed to look out of my window, the lights and humming were gone.  Have never experienced anything like this in my life, and have faith in God so am not afraid.;33.3284;-111.3502
Two lights in the sky over Rattlesnake Hill - next to the Superstion Mountain.;2015-10-18 18:15:00;10 minutes;Two lights in the sky over Rattlesnake Hill - next to the Superstion Mountain. We witnessed two round objects in the sky that seemed to be doing manuvers with one another.  Racing around each other in circles and changing colors.  They were green and changed to blue.  This went on for several minutes (approx. 10).  They were going horizonal and vertical.   I am a licensed Nurse and my mother is retired from that State.;33.3284;-111.3502
