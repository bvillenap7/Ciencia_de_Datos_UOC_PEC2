Two ellipses, the first one was slightly larger than the second and they appeared attached or tethered to one another;1998-10-04 21:00:00;6 seconds;We were walking our dog south on our street and I looked up over the house tops to the east and saw two ellipses, the first one was slightly larger than the second and they appeared attached or tethered to one another.  At the rear of the second ellipse was a tail, like a comet, but it was shimmering bright fluorescent green.  Both ellipses were the same color.  It was traveling through the sky about 30-35 degrees above the horizon from south to north and it was arcing to about 20 degrees and then disappeared.  It lasted about six seconds and made no apparent sound.  I was the first to notice it and I yelled at my husband and he also observed it. I am a teacher, elementary as well as high school, regular and exceptional education.  My husband is a machinist.;33.3284;-111.3502
