Extremely loud, slow-moving object with blinking red lights in a V form;2019-10-20 18:42:00;5 minutes;Extremely loud, slow-moving object with blinking red lights in a V form Sunday 20 October-about 18:42/Superstition Mts.    I heard a VERY loud roaring overhead.   Ran outside into the backyard just in time to see blinking red lights moving off into the NW.   I did NOT see the shape or outline of a craft.   Then i ran thru the house into the front yard.  Moving off into the NW I watched red lights blinking in a V form  first the R side would blink 3 red lights at a 45d angle (consecutively - not simultaneously) then the L side would blink 3 red lights at a 45d angle.   I watched the blinking lights for about 3 minutes to get an idea of the 'shape'.   The only reason i am reporting a 'V' form is due to the angle line of the blinking lights.    The craft was moving very slowly over the Superstitions into the NW.  I would deduct that due to the noise level, this is NOT a UAP  Am member of MUFON - attend Phoenix (Tempe) monthly meetings;33.3284;-111.3502
