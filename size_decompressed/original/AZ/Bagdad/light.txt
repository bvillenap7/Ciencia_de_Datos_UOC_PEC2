I Was driving from Vegas to Phoenix, in the US93 when me and my wife spotted 2 lights at the sky in the left of the road, and they was like sharing the light, couse some time one was more light than the other, the we spot a 3rd one in the right of the road, communicating with the other 2, the they just disappeared, like 5 minutes later, we spot the light again, but the 4 together, then they just disappeared again, later it was like 1 hour without seeing the lights when finally they appeared at the same time, one at the left of the road, one at the right of the road, landing in the top of a mountaing (and the light stayed in there like for 10 minutes, and 2 more crossing the small town of bahgdad,arizona, I have taped 3 of the lights.I called 911 to let them now about that.;34.5823;-113.1766
5 UFOs spotted outside of Bagdad AZ and follow us home all the way to Prescott AZ (1.5 hours away);2019-10-27 20:00:00;1 hour;5 UFOs spotted outside of Bagdad AZ and follow us home all the way to Prescott AZ (1.5 hours away) Its about 8:00 p.m. on Sunday, October 27th 2019 and my girlfriend and I are heading home to Prescott AZ from Bagdad AZ (about an hour and a half drive). Maybe 30 minutes into the ride we noticed there was a glowing orange light hovering above the top of a small mountain that was maybe 2 miles away. At first we thought it was a tower light we  had never noticed before, but then all of a sudden the orange light disappeared and the craft quickly ascended. The craft began blinking red on the border of it (kinda like a plane would), but it was random when it would blink and there was absolutely no way to see an actual shape of the craft. The craft flew right over the road above us, keeping speed with us, and then began crossing back left over the road. I started flashing my high-beams repeatedly to signal the UFO that I see it and, in my mind, it was a friendly gesture like saying hello. I wasn’t sure if the craft even saw me as it kept flying left, but then we ! noticed it flies up to a group of 4 more of them! Two were glowing orange and the others were already  darkened and blinking. They were flying around  each other in like a tornado formation and kinda looked like they were just having fun. I kept flashing my lights as I was getting further away in hopes they’d follow me. It worked actually! Well, only two crafts that I could see actually followed me, but for an hour they stayed with me the entire drive to Prescott. I kept flashing my lights to make sure they didn’t lose me and to show I didn’t forget about them. It was kinda creepy that they actually did follow us all the way to our apartment because I really didn’t think that was gonna happen when I initially flashed them, but once we got inside our home for like 10 min and then came back out they were gone. Next time I’m hoping they know I’m chill and they can swoop me up to hang for a bit. &#128406 &#128125&#128513;34.5823;-113.1766
