Flash, followed by falling teardrop ship, with fading redish trail.;2013-07-13 14:50:00;1 min 45 seconds;Flash, followed by falling teardrop ship, with fading redish trail. Me and my buddy were outside enjoy a cigarette and the night sky.  I turned my head to say something to my buddy whos still looking at the stars and out of no where a BRIGHT light (almost as if lightning/ but not), as if a flash from a camera but a whole lot more powerful, flashed and illuminated all of our surroundings.   I turned to look up and in the sky there was this...trail?? Like when you see a shooting star how it leaves the tiny white line for just a second, BUT this one was reddish-orange (more red than orange) the trail stayed for about 40 seconds then slowly fadded away.   We talked for about an hour about the event my buddy was staring at the sky when it happened and said he saw a teardrop like thing start to fall and thats when the flash happened.  Now the only difference between our stories is that he says he saw the flash first like a flash from a camera, then the red-orange trail we both watched the teardrop fall but we beli! eve it fell into the mountains.   Note: goose bumps, the hour we stayed outside two unexplainable events happened a mysterious fog roughly 15 minutes after sighting lasting 5 minutes but covering entire mountain side, and also a neighbor's light, dimming and getting brighter as if loosing power but at 3:23 in the morning????  Unexplainable.;33.8874;-111.9508
