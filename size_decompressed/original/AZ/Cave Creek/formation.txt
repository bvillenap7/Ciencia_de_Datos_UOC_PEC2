In dark sky over Rancho Manana noticed what looked like a very large constellation, almost like a large Cassiopea and an exaggerated Orion's belt together.   As we were looking, the stars appeared to hover around each other, they then started to move eastbound and separate from their formation and continue traveling.   We pulled the car over and watched them til the were out of our site.;33.8874;-111.9508
