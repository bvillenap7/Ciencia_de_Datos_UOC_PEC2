Floating orange/red balls, night time, responded to visual stimulation then took off.;2012-11-22 23:00:00;2 minutes;Floating orange/red balls, night time, responded to visual stimulation then took off. It was Thanksgiving day and i was working at a restaurant.  I left and started to make the short drive home.  I was half way to my house when I saw 6 orange/red balls floating about 100 ft above me and 500 ft in front of me.  As i drove closer the appeared to be floating in one spot.   At first i thought they were Chinese fire lantern but as i got closer i knew that's not what they were because I've seem them released at my school and these were more like glowing balls.  I stopped my truck and got out.   I took a flashlight from my truck hoping to shine it on them to see what it was and once   I turned it towards them they darted north on cave creek rd at high speed towards the mountains and they were gone.  They were silent and about the size of a basketball.  I've done alot of research and have yet to find any explanation as to what they could be, until I saw similar reports from other people seeing the same type of orb.  Mind blowing.;33.8874;-111.9508
Bright Light Streaked Across Sky Moving North East;2015-04-07 20:45:00;5 seconds;Bright Light Streaked Across Sky Moving North East On April 7, at approximately 8:45 pm, in Cave Creek, AZ., I saw a bright object streak across the sky.  It moved in a straight line at a slight upward angle and vanished.  The object was travelling north/east.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 5 seconds. The object was about 20 times bigger than what a planet appears to be in the sky.  I would guess its flight path to have occurred about 250 ft from the ground. It seemed slower than a meteor but way faster than a plane.  I would describe the movement as streaking across the sky.;33.8874;-111.9508
