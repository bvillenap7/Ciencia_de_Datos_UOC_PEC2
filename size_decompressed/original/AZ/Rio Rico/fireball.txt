Over Rio Rico Az.  15 minutes of tremendous noise in the air, nothing to be seen then silence. Suddenly a sporadic display of 5 sequential flashing bright fire orange lights flash in sequence but not in order, sporadically in different areas but not far from each other. Silence for 2 minutes, noise starts up again such as that of a freight train for another 5 minutes, then silence once again. This time 8 sequential but sporadic flashing bright lights rather large in nature appear over approximately the Amado-Az./Tubac -Az. area. However the size of the orange flashing lights were quite bright and large, much larger than that of an aircraft with no trail left behind as one would see with a comet or shooting star.
