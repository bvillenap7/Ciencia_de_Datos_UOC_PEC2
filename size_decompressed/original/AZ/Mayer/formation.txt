Lights seen over the Bradshaw Mts, Az.;2011-11-27 22:00:00;30 sec.;Lights seen over the Bradshaw Mts, Az. Driving N on 69, saw several lights, not much brighter than 0 magnitude, maybe -1,  appear over the Bradshaw Mts to the west, just above the horizon by one or two degrees.  They hovered and slightly moved, two seeming to merge, then one disappeared, then another.  As I was driving, I kept watch on the road for a moment.  Looking back again after several seconds, they were gone.;34.3655;-112.1296
