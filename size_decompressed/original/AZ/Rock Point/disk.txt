Dark-grayish flat like object, in the skies for approximately 10 seconds.;2016-10-29 10:30:00;10 seconds;Dark-grayish flat like object, in the skies for approximately 10 seconds. On  October 29th, 2016, at approximately 1030 hours. I was out on the fiel, with my nephew in-law, and shooting arrows at a target, when I noticed a dark grayish, round, flat object and the size of a plane from nose to tail, in the sky above us.  The object was moving north at a speed greater than that of a passenger plane.  Once I saw it, it flew for about 10 more seconds, and then it disappeared.  There were no clouds in the area, only to the far west. On these sightings, I only had my low quality phone, and unable to get a good picture of it and I don't have a camera.  When I did take it with my phone, it was to blurred, and unable to get a quality zoom (looks like dirt on my phone lens).  There have been many other sightings on this beautiful, wide-opened reservation and filled with flat area, canyons, and undiscovered, hidden areas.  It's friends and relatives that just have no one to tell or report to anyone.;36.7196;-109.63
