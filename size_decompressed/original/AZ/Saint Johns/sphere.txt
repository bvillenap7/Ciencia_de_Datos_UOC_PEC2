At about 9 AM I saw about 100 yards away a perfect sphere about 5 or 6 foot across hovering 75 yards off the ground that was moving very slow. It appeared as if observing from a distance. I walked towards it and it changed direction and as I compensated it changed direction again. Here is the important point, the sphere, I don't think I was supposed to see it because it was almost cloaked with the background. The closest I could come to describing this was that it refracted the light almost as if you were looking at a mirror ball in water. When it became obvious that I could see it in contrast to the sky by walking directly at it. It made several slow evasive moves, and then dropped away and down towards the ground and bush where I could not distinguish it in contrast to the ground and bush. Was unable to discern it at that point and lost my eyesight view to follow it. This event lasted about five minutes.;34.5016;-109.3739
