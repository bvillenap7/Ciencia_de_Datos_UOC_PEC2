Very large triangle rimmed with lights flying over highway .  ((NUFORC Note:  Cluster of Starlink satellites.  PD));2019-11-11 18:57:00;1 minute;Very large triangle rimmed with lights flying over highway near petrified forest I was driving from Santa Fe, NM, to Prescott Arizona last night. On the highway, apparently in Concho AZ- just a handful of miles before the petrified forest national monument, I happened to see lights in the sky. Once I focused in on them, it was obvious that this was no optical illusion or military drill.  At first, it appeared to be a long string of maybe 25 lights “flying in formation”, very slowly. The nature of their flight path was obscure and sort of hovering upwards as they progressed to the south. It was tilting slightly, which is when I realized the lights were many lights that lined the edges of a seemingly very large triangular craft. It seemed to be huge, bigger than a small town I would imagine. As it tilted further, in could tell it was a solid triangle only by the way it’s shape blocked out stars and such. I watched it fly as it got quicker and quicker towards the south side of the highway, until it angled upwards and flew into the upper atmosphere / outer space. Breathtaking. I was driving while it happened, and tried to take a video but my iPad couldn’t focus in the dark. That is how I have time and location stamp.;34.4458;-109.6741
