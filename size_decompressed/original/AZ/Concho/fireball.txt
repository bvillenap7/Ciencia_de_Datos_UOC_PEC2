It was rapidly moving downward and became brighter as it appeared to fall.  It looked almost as if it was on fire.  There was a military her in flight just above it.  The light quickly went out after increase in the brightness.  We soon saw at least 6-8 aircraft in the area as if they were looking for something.  We noticed 3 additional bright lights in the sky very high in the atmosphere one was orange and the other two were blue. They were all traveling different directions.  One was heading southeast to northwest. Another was heading south to north, and the third was heading southwest to east.  The fireball lasted approximately 3 minutes, and the others were seen within a 30 minute time span after we saw the fireball looking light.  Myself and my husband both lost cell phone service and it did not come back on until 9:20pm.;34.4458;-109.6741
