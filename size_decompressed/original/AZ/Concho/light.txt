Lights over Northeastern AZ;2021-05-08 20:05:00;5 minutes;Lights over Northeastern AZ At approx 20:05 on May 8 2021 in Concho, AZ, I was approaching my house after an evening walk, when I witnessed several white lights in the western sky moving northwardly. These lights appeared at a point or origin approximately 30 degrees above the horizon from my location. The lights made no sound, and moved at the same rate equidistant from each other. Approx 4 to five lights would appear, on after the other, all moving north in a straight line in succession before the first light or lead light would fade out abruptly, then another would appear at the point of origin. They appeared to move at an upward angle - not falling like a meteorite or aircraft flare. I witnessed no aircraft and the brightness was about equivalent to the evening stars in the sky. I went inside and grabbed my phone and told my wife to come outside. The lights were still appearing as we came outside the house and I pointed them out to my wife who confirmed what I saw. The lights conti! nued to appear for another 4 minutes before fading away altogether. During this sighting, the point of origin did not appear to move. I was able to capture about 2:55 min worth of video before the lights faded.  I was a witness to the Phoenix Lights many years ago and I remember how they seemed to hover in the air. These lights moved rapidly.;34.4458;-109.6741
