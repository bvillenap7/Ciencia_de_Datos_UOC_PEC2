Then 30 minutes into our fishing my boyfriend was talking to me and my daughter about Catfishing, when all of a sudden he shouted out loud LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, pointing to something behind me.  I was a bit scared but me and my daughter both looked back.  Thats when we all saw 2 red lights slanted side by side on top of a mountain that was probably 5 miles away.  But these red lights look like a couple of Jellyfishs.  It stayed lite for 5 seconds then it just disappeared. We we're all shock because that is something we never saw before.  Two hours past and within that time we kept talking about the sighting.  But we also looked at all the stars in the sky that night hoping we would see more.  But didn't.  It was getting cold after those two hours so we decided to head on home. We we're headed towards the main dirt road but had to stop and open the gate to it.  That's when my boyfriend opened it and had my daughter drive up a bit to close it after.  My daughter parked it and looked back to the pond which is now towards the left side.  The second she turn, she shouted out loud LOOK MOM LOOK.  Thats when we both saw a orange football shape light right on top of  the pond we were   fishing.  The pond was only 2 minutes away and this light was 30 ft. in the air from the pond.  I was completely scared at this point me and my daughter were shouting to my boyfriend to hurry.  This was light was very close and big.  Like the size of my mom's dodge caravan. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));33.8004;-109.9922
