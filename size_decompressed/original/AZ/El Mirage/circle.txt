Big Bluish Green slow moving light spotted over El Mirage AZ;2012-03-30 22:20:00;4 or 5 seconds;Big Bluish Green slow moving light spotted over El Mirage AZ i caught it out of the corner of my eye as i was on my way home last night, it looked big, kinda of a dull bluish green color.. at first i thought it was a cool falling star but it was going kind of slow and it was in the sky for a good 4 or 5 seconds which is a very long time for a falling star to burn.it was huge and at first it was moving an a downward angle but then it kind of seemed to lift up a bit and straighten out then it just disappeared. when i got home and spoke to my wife, whom was at her moms house in surprise az at the time, she told me what she saw BEFORE i said anything about what i saw.. she said she went out to the truck for something and before she got in the truck something told her look up and as she did the bluish green light appeared out of nowhere right on top of her and flew by moving westward.. i did a little research since this whole thing has me wondering wtf.. apparently on march 14th 2012 at about 7:45PM a bunch of people in ph! oenix say they saw a bluish green light in the sky. someone caught that one on video that time.. that same light was spotted over San Diego, Vegas and Tuscon on the same night;33.6096;-112.3253

1-3 orange lights, over a short period of time.  West sky from West Valley area of Phoenix.;2014-10-12 00:45:00;25 minutes;1 to 3 orange lights, over a short period of time.  West sky from West Valley area of Phoenix. According to iphone compass 250 degrees west saw 1 orange light roughly 3-4x the size of a typical star in the sky.  Starting moving up, called my son out.  He saw. It flickered while moving up then disappeared.   Went out 5 mins later, another one in the same spot showed up didn't move up but flickered and disappeared.  We both witnessed this and couldn't get a good picture.   Went out again 10 mins later my son and daughter both had their phones trying to get good pictures.  Couldn't.  Two orange lights showed up.  The top one fizzled out and a third one showed up below it.   Tried videos but an iPhone isnt very good in the dark.  Both the remaining lights fizzled out.  I didn't see any blue or red flashing lights to be an aircraft.  And although close to Luke AFB I've seen aircraft flares from my time in the service.  They weren't that.   I honestly just don't know.  All I know is they were orange.  Larger than a star.  Moved.  And they were in the same spot when the new one came back.   It's been 25 minutes and I keep checking back but haven't seen them since.;33.6096;-112.3253

It seemed very low like small plane or helicopter height, but was brighter than anything I have seen before.  It almost immediately began moving rapidly in a straight northeast direction, never diminishing in size or brightness but with a bright orange tail trailing it and passing directly over my house.  It seemed to be decending, dropping out of view over the roof but was gone by the time I ran to the other side of the house.;33.6096;-112.3253

Not a sound came from this object.  The sight of this object was like it was in HD.  I could see the outline of the shape perfectly.  This object flew by with speeds that I have never seen.  Then out of nowhere it just disappeared.;33.6096;-112.3253
