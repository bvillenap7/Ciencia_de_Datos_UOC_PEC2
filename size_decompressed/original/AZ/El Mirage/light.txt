They looked like stars but it was still a little early and light out to see stars.  They meandered slowly and oddly and gave off constant light so we knew it wasn't aircraft from Luke air force base.  They moved like nothing I've ever seen.  They headed east towards a bright star or close planet perhaps -east by north east- before they disappeared out of view.  It lasted about 10 minutes from when I first noticed them.;33.6096;-112.3253
