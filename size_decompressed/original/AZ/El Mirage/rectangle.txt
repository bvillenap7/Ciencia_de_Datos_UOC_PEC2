We saw several (approximately a dozen) sparkling metallic reflections in a group.  Moving up, down, left to right, approximately 2500 feet high or more, on a clear day, for about 5 minutes.  We have never seen anything like this.  They were not birds, planes, balloons, or any identifiable craft of any sort.  This lasted for about 5 minutes.  Then they just disappeared.  Strangest thing we have ever seen.;33.6096;-112.3253
