We looked up to the west sky approximately at 45-50 degrees from the horizon and saw what we first thought was a meteor entering the atmosphere. There were actual orange and yellow flames coming from the object for about 5 seconds. Judging by the size of the flames the object must have been fairly large.  The flames went out and an oval object appeared.  It was translucent and an orange/yellow color.  The object did not move for about 30 seconds.  The oval objectâ€™s orange/yellow color or light went completely out and than a white light appeared as though it was a star in the night.  The object then moved in a straight line left for several seconds and then moved right in a straight line as well, also several seconds.  It then stopped for several seconds then went straight down vertically for about 15 seconds and then went west and disappeared into the horizon. The weather conditions that evening were clear skies with low humidity. The moon was not out. I have been in Phoenix since 1976 and have seen many falling stars and meteorites fall from the sky. None of them ever did what we saw that night.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
