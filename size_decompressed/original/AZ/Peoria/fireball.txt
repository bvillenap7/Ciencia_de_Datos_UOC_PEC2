A flying object appeared to be on fire, South of the West Phoenix Valley.;2001-12-02 01:10:00;30 minutes?;A flying object appeared to be on fire, South of the West Phoenix Valley. On December 2, 2001, at approximately 01:10 hours from the city of Peoria looking due South, I noticed what appeared to be a very bright red star about 70 degrees high from the horizon.  In amazement over its intensity for being about the size of the end of a pencil eraser, I told my spouse that even if it was Mars it sure was bright.  I then went into the house to get my binoculars. Within the four to five minutes that lapsed while I was in the house the red star appeared to have dropped and/or moved down about 15 degrees and was slightly larger than previously noticed.  The object dropped down to about 35 degrees above the horizon before it changed directions towards the West, now moving horizontally! After moving horizontally for approximately four to five minutes, the object suddenly expanded at least three times its initial size into a fire pulsing motion (for about two minutes), before the glow of the object succeeded back to its initial size. After another three to four minutes, pieces or parts appeared to be falling from or breaking off the flying object while it continued moving horizontally.  Eight of the nine glowing objects that fell straight down, faded or burned out with 20 seconds, while the largest falling glow did not fade in intensity and appeared to fall intact somewhere Northwest of Gila Bend.  The flying object continued West for approximately six minutes before it disappeared.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

I was waiting at the bus stop and I seen a glowing ball of light in the distance it was falling straight down towards the earth. At first i thought it a air plane of fire and about to crash, but before it hit the ground, it suddenly dissapeared! about three seconds later it reappeared in the upper right side of the sky from where it dissapeared. Once it reapeared, it started to glide around the sky at great speeds, yet it did it so gracefully. It continued to disappear and reappear at random locations. It continued to do this for about 10 to 15 minutes the it dissapeared one last time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

This fireball went out and then then appeared to be just plane lights, with a red light and a white strobe, just like any other plane at light.  Something then dropped from this object, whatever it was had a white light.   At first we believed it was a plane burning up with a piece that fell off, but whatever it was appeared have a small white light on it, not like a burning object falling.  That object did not appear to fall as fast as something falling to earth.  It could have been something dropped with a parachute with a light attached.   We watched it with appeared to be plane lights which then appeared to fly in a circle for about a couple of minutes.   Then it straightened out and headed in the direction of Sky Harbor airport in Phx, descending as would a normal plane coming in for a landing. This whole time we believed it might be a plane with some serious mechanical problems, but whatever it dropped was out of the ordinary and we couldnâ€™t find any mention of any unusual occurrences on any news reports.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
12/31/12  20:32 Peoria AZ Orange Burning Orb.;2012-12-31 20:28:00;10 minutes;12/31/12  20:32 Peoria AZ Orange Burning Orb Wife and I of 26 years had just got into the Hot Tub, as I sat back I noticed a BURNING ORB. Never made a sound of any kind during the sighting. My first thought was hey look someone set off some fireworks, kinda early in the evening for that.  I had innitial thought firework due to the altitude of the object not being very high from the ground.   But my wife had noticed that this wasn't a fireworks rocket because in was gaining altitude and speed as it crossed the sky directly over head from West to East.   I then noticed its speed was quiet fast as it traveled just to where it was going to be obscured by trees.   It stopped changed from a bright Orange flame color to white flame and shot straight up in the air and vanished;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Fireball in sky, slowed to a complete stop, then dimmed out in the night sky.;2013-09-27 22:20:00;3 minutes;Fireball in sky, slowed to a complete stop, then dimmed out in the night sky. My girlfriend and I walked out on the south balcony, she said look, a plane on fire.  Object was not an aircraft, no light blinking (red/green/or anti-collision light.)  Object appeared to be on fire, bright orange glow, looked like heading north from the Estrella Mountain range then East, slowed to a stop, then dimmed out as if it was heading up, no sound heard, no other aircraft in area.  Took some pic's with my camera phone, will post.  Approx. time 10:20-10:23.  This is the second time I've seen this type of object in the Peoria, AZ area, first time was in January 2013, also reported.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

I looked up and there was an object, which at first i thought was a meteor coming down, so I waited to see if it would tear in pieces, like it would regularly would of it was a meteor, but this had no color like to a meteor it was vivid red not orange or yellowish parts.  So then this object stopped moving i would say it stopped near the 101 close to Phoenix Cardinals stadium.  So when it stopped, two smaller red things came out of it directly going down to the city!   I was recording all this at the time but when i tried to look back at it, it was gone!  The recording only shows when I am bearly going to move my camera up to record these lights!  Anyhow when these two lights go down the bigger object turns white, like glowing supper bright and it keeps going west for about a 2 to 5 second distance in the air and it drops another object which als! o goes straight down to the city, mean while the bigger object disappears at an extremely fast speed!  Then the first two objects come back up and also disappear!  Air craft then started appearing around the same area!

Orange orbs seen in the southwest skies of Peoria, AZ, during the Superbowl 2/3/19.;2019-02-03 19:22:00;1 minute;Orange orbs seen in the southwest skies of Peoria, AZ, during the Superbowl 2/3/19. Two of us were walking through our neighborhood, when we saw two fireballs shooting up in the air slowly.  In under 20 seconds, one first dimmed to a speck, and then the second one, ten seconds later.   Then we continued to watch both specks split apart and travel over our heads until it was completely behind our heads.  They traveled from the above the horizon over out heads to what appeared nearly 100-120 degree angle.  The distance was amazing as well as the quickness the bright orange circular light died out, then continued to travel.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
