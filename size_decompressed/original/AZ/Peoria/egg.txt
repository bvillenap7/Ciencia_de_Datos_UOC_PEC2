Silver, solid, egg shaped object heading NW.;2010-06-02 18:20:00;15 seconds;Silver, solid, egg shaped object heading NW. Silver, egg-like object heading Northwest across the sky in broad daylight during heavy traffic. No visible windows, lights, wings, etc. Flying at the height  and speed you would typically see a helicopter flying but it was very clearly something other than a helicopter.  I was driving at the time so it was hard to get a good look at it. Disappeared behind some trees and neither I nor my two passengers were able to spot it again. I am used to observing all types of planes, helicopters and even jets (Luke Airforce Base) flying around here in the West Phoenix Valley, but this air craft was unrecognizable.
