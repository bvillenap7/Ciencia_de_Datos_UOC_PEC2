At about 10:10pm with a crystal clear sky, I noticed a round kind of dark dot in the sky to the west.  I pointed this out to my wife and she saw it immediately.  The object came closer and closer and it appeared to be an irregular shape, the shape of a police badge.  No lights were on this object and it did not make any noise.   As it went overhead we could see that it was a subdued color illuminated by the reflection of the city lights. It looked to be a muddy, brown color.  From our point of view, it seemed to be very large, moving in the horizon. It quickly left our view, moving a west-to-east direction.  We saw the bottom of the object as it went over us.  It looked eerie it was a muddy brown color with a little pink reflected from the city lights.  It went directly overhead and it was definitely an irregular shape, the shape of a police badge.  The whole spotting time was approximately 1½ to 2 minutes in duration.  It was going horizon to horizon and looked like the size of a full moon. The trajectory was close to perfect, going west to east.   The next morning I spent my time on the phone trying to see if anyone else had reported anything, so far I haven’t heard anything.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Amber sphere breaks up into multiple fragments, 2 seperate repeated events.;2014-12-21 03:00:00;25 minutes;Amber sphere breaks up into multiple fragments, 2 seperate repeated events. Early on the morning of December 21, 2014, I had noticed a bright flickering amber-colored light in the North horizon.  I watched it fly south, toward my direction, in a non-linear fashion until it was practically right overhead, still slightly to the North.  The single light dimmed temporarily before flaring up and breaking up into 3-5 different pieces that all went separate directions at different speeds.  When the original light broke up, it brightened immensely and seemed to fall apart, with the separate pieces having tails similar to a small fireball.  Some stayed illuminated, some dimmed to faint red dots barely discernable from the night stars.  After about 15-20 seconds, all of the lights had dimmed to blinking red dots flying in separate directions. About 2 minutes after this event occurred, another amber-colored light appeared on the Northern horizon, in the same exact area and followed the same general path in the sky. The flickering amber light flew to the same general area that I had seen the previous one in, and broke apart in the same manner as the first, dispersing fireball-like lights in separate directions that all eventually turned into blinking red lights.  The lights changed direction and speed, but never fast enough to seem like a shooting star or something falling into our atmosphere. I was compelled enough to call the local Non-Emergency line to report this incident, and they actually dispatched two units to my house fairly quickly, within 10 minutes of my call.  I was surprised to say the least.  By the time they had shown up, the lights were gone and I was left defending my sobriety and right state of mind.  After a few minutes describing what I had seen, the police jovially dismissed me by stating, Sadly enough, I don't have the Magic School Bus, and I can't fly up there and investigate what you saw.   I actually appreciated his humor and thanked him for his time.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

At first I though it was a buzzard.  It going about 100 to 150 mph at about 1000 ft.  It was going too fast and a straight to be a buzzard.  There was a 737 flying above it at about 5000 ft.  It was a clear day and no clouds.  It was shaped like the object from the U.S. Navy video ,not the the tictac object.  It was not a buzzard because they never fly in a straight line.  The 737 was flying much faster that the object.  There was no sound from the object but I could hear the 737.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
