Amber lights near Tolleson, AZ;2005-10-04 18:55:00;10 min;Amber lights near Tolleson, AZ Looking south oward Tolleson, AZ, I observed 3 amber lights in a horizontal plane from east to west approx. 5,000 ft up and spaced about 300 ft apart. After watching them for about 10 min. the lights began to flicker and disappeared one at a time from right to left.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

Formation of amber lights over (around) Tolleson, AZ, that would flicker off and on over a span of 90 minutes (we took pictures).   Media said they thought that they were flares and/or weather balloons and that they received several calls.  Definately NOT any of those explainations.  We drove towards them and observed them for 90 minutes.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
V-shaped array of soft-white lights, between 7 to 11 of them, flying silently in a straight line with no discernible relative motion.;2006-10-18 21:00:00;10 seconds;V-shaped array of soft-white lights, between 7 to 11 of them, flying silently in a straight line with no discernible relative motion. Saw a boomerang V-shapped formation of about 7 to 11 soft-white lights flying silently from west to east.  No visible craft per se, just the lights.  No strobe light, no red/green wingtip lights, no colors, no flashing.  No turn, bank, pitch up or down.   No way to judge size or altitude.  Traversed about 45 degrees of the sky while it was visible, at an elevation angle of about 75 degrees, from west of my location to east of my location.   Initial impression was that it was a flock of white birds (e.g., geese) slowly flying in formation perhaps 100 feet above my house's roof, but then I realized that there were no flapping wings, no relative motion between the white spots whatsoever, and no ground lights capable of illuminating anything like that -- had to be self-illunminated.   Disappeared rather suddenly, but not instantaneously, as it moved away from me.  I speculate that it might have been a B2 flying wing bomber if they had no typical civil aircraft running lights, an array of between 7 to 11 soft-white lights on the leading edge, and were capable of virtually silent motion.  I do live just a few miles NE of Luke AFB, AZ.   I was in a spa (hot tub) at the time, so its noise could have been masking quiet sounds from the object, but I routinely easily hear normal propeller, jet and helicopter sounds when they fly nearby while I'm in the spa.   Could have been a very large object or formation of objects very high up (although there was no discernible relative motion between the lights whatsoever), or something much smaller and much lower.   If it was something the size of a B2, it could only have been a few hundred feet in altitude.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

Satellites and a few bright stars were visible and were noticeably dimmer than the object.  The object was low On the horizon, lower than the satellites, but was stationary.  From the west it was above The eastern/southeastern sky toward chandler/ahwatukee. Trip originated at 101w and I10 and ended at 52nd st and Broadway and the object was observed for another 15 minutes but was not visible when the sky lightened at dawn. The corona was remarkable, not a solid circle of glow but 5 or 6 strong arms Of light coming off of it that were several times longer than the object itself. After 15minutes that dimmed for a minute or two and then was bright again.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Blue Light Seen Hovering Over West Wing Mountain, Peoria, Arizona;2012-02-22 05:15:00;90 seconds;Blue Light Seen Hovering Over West Wing Mountain, Peoria, Arizona We live in the West Wing development, near West Wing Parkway and Black Rock Boulevard. Our home is approximately one mile south of West Wing Mountain which is located in the West Wing Mountain Preserve.   About 5:15am this morning, Wednesday, February 22, I took our three dogs out into the backyard.   Looking north, towards West Wing Mountain, I noticed a blue light which appeared to be hovering several hundred feet above the highest peak.  One of my dogs seemed to notice the light as well, as he gazed towards the light.   After maybe twenty seconds, the light increased in its intensity for about five seconds before returning to its previous lower brightness.  I would say that the light increased its brightness by a factor of four or five.  It repeated that pattern of temporarily increasing its brightness three times.   Then, after another twenty seconds or so, it suddenly disappeared as if a switch had been thrown.  My dog then acted very agitated and wanted to go back! inside our home.  The light did not move at any time we were watching it and there was no sound of any kind coming from its direction.   A few seconds after the light disappeared, a commercial jet aircraft flew over our home headed from Phoenix towards the northwest.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

Light Formation Seen Over West Wing Mountain, Peoria, Arizona.;2013-05-15 23:15:00;5 minutes;Light Formation Seen Over West Wing Mountain, Peoria, Arizona. Last night, while taking the dogs out for the night, I noticed a bright white light over West Wing Mountain, which is here in Peoria, AZ.  The light suddenly burst into several smaller white lights which then began to move around each other.  When the light &quotburst&quot there were glowing streamers briefly projected out from the original light, which gave the initial appearance of a pyrotechnic.  However, after about a minute, they all suddenly disappeared. Another minute or so went by and then three white lights re-appeared in the same location as the previous lights.  These three were of a brighter intensity and continued to move around each other, but the movement was much slower than earlier.  After about two minutes, these three then suddenly disappeared as well, as if a switch were thrown. After a short delay, several more lights appeared, but this time there was about ten to twelve of them.  They were of different intensities and were of differing colors, red, blue, yellow and white.  These were also moving around, but at a quicker speed, like the first appearance.  The movement was deliberate, as if they were circling each other, but the entire formation itself remained stationary.  The lights disappeared about a minute later and did not reappear again. This is the second time that I have seen an unknown light over West Wing Mountain.  In February of 2012, I saw an unknown blue light early one morning, which I reported to the center later that day.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

Thinking maybe it was a piece of a meteor or space junk falling to earth, I stopped to look and there was no fire ball or tail.   It flew over a house not to high up and stopped approximately in front of me about 50 foot foot in the air and approximately a 100 feet in front of me it sat there about 6 or 7 seconds where I could see some dark images as I looked at it straight on or even blurry;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

I thought it was a red light on a helicopter.  It was moving really fast through the sky.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-16 20:30:00;5-10 minutes;When I first looked up I thought it was a red light on a helicopter.  It was moving really fast through the sky and i thought maybe its a satilite.  Then i thought maybe its a UFO and it stoped moving right there in the night sky.  I watched as it zoomed past orions belt (from my perspective on the sky) and stopped again on the (left side of the sky facing west.  It zoomed back to the right (south) and stoped for another 5 seconds.  I watched it zoom around stopping and going for about 2 minutes.  Then it went up and zoomed down in a confusing spiral toward the earth nearby.   In a panick, I yelled for my Fiance, I had to run about 50 ft inside to shake him awake.  When we got outside, it was still there in the sky above the neigborhood zooming around.  It looked like it was over the neighbors house at one point hovering.  I watched as it split into two red lights whith a single green dot between and then morphed back into the single red light then zoomed into a far neighborhood (Northwest) as it seemed to fall to the earth.   I tried to finish watering my garden after my husband went inaide i saw it zoom west from the Northeast of my house as if above a nearby neighborhood.

Witnessed a string of star-like lights traveling at an even speed across the sky from the southwest to the northeast. They were evenly spaced at first and seemed to be following the same path, but then there would be times when four lights in relatively close proximity would go by, or one light would take a slightly different path. They did all seem to travel at the same speed, no matter what path they took.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Bright craft light sighting in Peoria, AZ;2021-04-04 20:15:00;4 minutes;Bright craft light sighting in Peoria, AZ I let my dog out in the backyard before putting her to bed. Shortly after sitting down in a chair on my patio, I noticed a light approaching that seemed quite a bit lower than the aircraft I’m used to seeing in the area, including military aircraft. In fact, within my same view, I could see two commercial aircraft with blinking lights. The craft in question had a solid white light and it wasn’t blinking at all. I’m estimating that the craft was approximately 7-10 thousand feet up and was approaching at a low speed. I watched it for at least 2-3 minutes. It seemed to be on a path that would bring it right over my house, which in near N Dysart Rd and W Jomax Rd. I started to feel like it was actually coming right towards me at one point. My dog then ran over by me and I called my grandson outside. We both stared at it for around 1 minute and commented how it was so low and that there was no noise. It slowly began to climb in altitude and within 5 seconds, it a! ccelerated upwards so fast that it went from a bright light to looking like a small star, and then totally disappeared. The whole sighting was so surreal that I unfortunately didn’t even think about filming it with my cell phone. I'll be ready when/if it happens again. Feel free to let me know if you have any further questions.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
