Moved quickly in sky, was NOT a plane as it changed directions several times, red/white lights;2004-04-11 19:30:00;5 minutes;Moved quickly in sky, was NOT a plane as it changed directions several times, red/white lights Easter Sunday - My wife and I just watch an object in the sky that I initially think is Mercury.  It appears to be red, however upon closer inspection it appeared to be flashing alternating colors - red, white, possibly blue blips of light, possibly circular in motion.  It would move rapidly, then appear to hover without moving in any direction.  It was quite far away, so not much detail other than this.  Then it would move rapidly again, getting discernably smaller even at such great distances.  It was in the southwestern sky, then moved left . . . then moved slightly right, then took off to the left again and disappeared;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

Then after the plane was gone we noticed a flashing light that appeard to be moving back and forth. Of course nothing was thought of it until it stayed in the same spot. There were colors that were flashing from it. They were in a pattern of red, blue, then yellow or white. Again this object kept moving side to side. I ran and got my cam corder and was able to capture this on film. It started becoming smaller and withen minutes was just gone. I am not saying that I witnessed a UFO but I know it was no aircraft that our goverment lets us know they have the technology for. If any one can help us clarify this it would be greatly appreciated. Also, during the time I was recording this, my husband was taking pictures with our digital camera at the sky just to see if any thing would show up. These pictures are remarkable and they, as well, are not of any pictures I have ever seen. Thank you for tacking the time to read this. I hope youcan help us understand.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Slow moving bright white light emitting particles;2005-09-22 19:30:00;10 seconds;Slow moving bright white light emitting particles Bright white beam shining on and emitting particles.  Event was only a few seconds long and occured due west of 33.7N/112.3W.  Zizag clouds from HAARP experments were also visible and common.  This event was between the zizag clouds and my location.  A second witness was summoned but could only afirm the existance of a huge particle cloud.  We both witnessed its dissapation in only a few minutes.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
5 white dots racing upwards from downtown Phoenix area, moving at different speeds, then fading in to the night;2007-12-22 21:30:00;5 minutes;5 white dots racing upwards from downtown Phoenix area, moving at different speeds, then fading in to the night I was in Peoria at a night club with friends on the patio and someone pointed to the sky where we saw several faint white dots maybe just south of downtown phoenix, but very high in the sky.  It was roughly 9:30pm.   There were 5 lights that I could make out.  Very faint.  They were traveling upwards it seemed, and they were traveling at different speeds, as if they were a family walking with a few child stragglers trying to catch up.  I had no explanation, and soon they just faded still travelling upward.   I was dumbfounded people could just discard it and go back to dancing--this was my first time seeing anything in the night sky that couldn’t be explained.  And trust me, I’d prefer an explanation that could set my mind at ease.   But I’m certain the human race still has much it does not know and cannot understand--even with the modern science and technology.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
String of lights in Phoenix area;2010-12-04 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;String of lights in Phoenix area One evening in early December, 2010, my husband and I were entertaining some guests on our back patio in north Peoria, Arizona.  As I was gazing at the sky, I noticed a string of about 3-4 bright amber lights in what looked like a line formation moving toward us from the west in a northeasterly direction.   I thought the lights looked strange, so I focused on them and noticed several more of these lights coming up behind the others from over a mountain to the west.  I then pointed them out to the others and we all became very excited and inquisitive wondering what they could be.   For the next 10-15 minutes or so, it seemed like an endless stream of lights coming one behind the other.  As they came closer to the east, we listened to hear if maybe they were Air Force jets, but we could hear absolutely nothing.  I’m estimating that there were upwards to 19 or so lights that we counted over a period of about 10-15 minutes.   Everyone agreed that these lights looked odd and didn’t appear to be aircraft we had ever seen before, especially since they were amber colored and had no white or red lights on them that we could see.   As we continued to watch, the lights seemed to change direction and began to head southwest until we could no longer see them.   I turned on the TV hoping to hear something about these strange lights, but I never did.   Were these aircraft from Luke Air Force base or were they something else entirely.  Have you received other reports about these lights or know what they were?   Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Weird loud noise then flashing bright white lights over Peoria, AZ March 25th 1:45AM.;2013-03-25 01:45:00;20 seconds;Weird loud noise then flashing bright white lights over Peoria, AZ March 25th 1:45AM It was 1:45am Monday morning March 25th (Peoria, AZ) - I couldn't sleep - I was listening to some music while lying in my bed trying to fall asleep. I heard a weird noise getting louder outside my window to the north. I cannot describe the sound (it was something I have never heard before - maybe like a machine) but it got louder over the music I was playing. I immediately got out of bed to turn the music off so I could figure out this sound I was hearing. I got up out of bed, the sound stopped, I was now facing my other bedroom window to the south (all blinds were closed).  As soon as the sound stopped, I saw brilliant white flashing lights outside my window.  It was like 50 strobe lights turned on for about 5-10 seconds. The only word I can describe this would be &quotspectacular.&quot Everything happened so fast and the brilliance of these white lights seems unearthly to me... I called two police stations in the morning to see if there were any reports of this unusual phenomenon, but there were none reported. I cannot imagine no one seeing this display of flashing lights, although it only lasted for 5-10 seconds. I am making this report to see if anyone else experienced this occurrence...;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Unexplainable loud noise.;2013-06-22 23:00:00;1 minute;unexplainable loud noise Loud pulsating woor-woor...woor-woor...woor-woor... woor-woor noise.  Extremely loud, low frequency sound.  Our dogs went crazy and we went to see what it was but saw nothing.  The noise stopped and then started up again for about 10 seconds and then stopped again.  It's hard to describe how loud  and intense this was.  Like it was coming from our backyard.  We are used to jets from the AFB but this was not a fighter jet sound.  No explanation… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Weird maneuvers by bright lights.;2016-06-11 23:20:00;10 minutes;Weird maneuvers by bright lights. Red and green lights appeared in the sky, I thought it was a helicopter.  Starting moving really fast and zig-zagging unlike a helicopter then the lights were red & white and it looked like it hid under a tree line.   Came back after a few minutes but went back down.   I started to think that a military craft should show up soon and sure enough one did.  This thing was moving fast acting weird going left and right appearing wobbly up and down and was quiet.  The only thing I could hear was a slight crackling sound like a fuse after it's lit.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
 We have witnessed multiple lights looking like satellites with varing degrees of brightness in orbit.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-15 20:20:00;25 minutes;Aroumd 8:15 pm AZ 20:15 on 4/15/20 We have witnessed multiple lights looking like satellites with varing degrees of brightness in orbit 4 to 5 across sky at same time heading from SSW to NE. They were continuous Non stop for 25 min one following another. Definatly not planes or Space X as they were not all clustered together. Steady light very fast at least 2 dozen witnessed. They appeared to be satellites but observed many spaced out all back to back across same orbital path. Very unusual to see so many consecutive at a time spaced equally apart yet close. Any explaination. Location is 33.74 N - 112.35 W    Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
