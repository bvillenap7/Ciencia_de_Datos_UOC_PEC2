Disk with  bright lights going around it moving erratically and fast!;2021-03-16 02:22:00;2 minutes;Disk with  bright lights going around it moving erratically and fast! I was walking down the street in the afternoon  when I can a bright object in the distance. It did NOT look like a plane, drone, helicopter, weather balloon, meteorite, or low altitude satellite. It was flipping around and had an erratic flight path. It was bright at 2:22 pm in the afternoon on a sunny day. I took two pictures in the general direction, hoping my cell phone camera would capture something, because it was moving fast and erratic. Then, I expanded one of the pictures and it looked like a roundish object with bright lights around it. It was mesmerizing, I have never have seen anything move like this thing before in my life. After about two minutes, it disappeared. When I expanded the picture I took, it looked like a round disk, with lights going around it.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
