The two orange balls were joined by another then the two turned into one red ball then broke into two again before ascending.;2000-11-05 01:00:00;20-25 min;The two orange balls were joined by another then the two turned into one red ball then broke into two again before ascending. After returning home from work, I saw 2 round orange lights.At first I thought that it was a plane,but then saw the lights moving individually around each other and knew this was the day I had been waiting for. I yelled to my friends wife to come look. Then I saw the third light to the south of the first two which were to the direct east of my location at 71st and Peoria. She immediately called the neighbors who ran out to see them also.My friend then pulled up from the store, as did his son from going out.We all stood there and watched as the two hoovered around staying fairly close to each other but separate. Then the 3rd ufo started moving towards the first two. It seemed to be south as far as south mountain when first seen, but moved north to be a mile or so south of the pair in 25-30 seconds. It stayed there while we saw the two orange lights merge into one red ball for maybe 45 seconds then separate. Then all three now orange again moved north keeping the distance from the pair to the single 1-2 miles. They also gained a massive amount of altitude, and seemed to be blinking or had clouds or something passing under them. As they all were getting harder to see, the single dissapeared. Next the follower in the pair dissapeared and the leader broke into two separate yellow or white lights and both of them dissapeared. I wonder what in the heck is going on?;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

I saw a UFO, then, it disappeared!;2014-11-05 18:40:00;<1 minute;I saw a UFO, then, it dissapeared! The shape and color looked just like a star, however, it was two to three times bigger than a star!  This is why it caught my attention. It began to navigate vertically at a fast speed. Then, while still hight up in the sky, it suddenly stopped and dissapeared!  When it stopped, it appeared as if it had landed on something because the shape became a bit flat from the bottom and  bit of  splash of lights came out through the bottom right and left hand side, then it dissapeared. My husband saw an actual , odd shaped, spaceship about 2.5 years ago around the same area.  He saw it during daylight!  It was just up there, not moving! It disappeared while he was looking at it!  He didn't want to tell anyone because he didn't want people to think he's crazy!!  He's definately NOT crazy! ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Sorry. It was yesterday,  11/05/2015 ((END ADDENDUM));33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
20 orange orbs over Peoria, AZ.;2015-03-21 20:30:00;30 minutes;20 orange orbs over Peoria AZ About 8:30 PM, on the 21 of March 2015, my son was leaving to go to a friendâ€™s house, and came back in the house and stated that there were weird lights in the sky.   My friends, the wife, and I went outside to see what he was looking at.  In the sky there were 5 orange orbs in line traveling to the east just over my house.  They would fade away and more would come up over the horizon in the western night sky.   These didn't look like flares (no smoke, no streaking tail and they were traveling slowly).   As many as 20 came over the house in 30 minutes before fading out.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
