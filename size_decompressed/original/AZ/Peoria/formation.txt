3 lights in formation NW of Peoria, AZ.;2012-06-19 19:45:00;1 minute - two times;3 lights in formation NW of Peoria, AZ. Was walking my dog and looked to the West/Northwest and saw 3 orange/yellow lights in a horizontal formation.  They were several miles away, possibly over Wickenburg.  The light on the left of the formation would zip off to the left (south/southwest) and another would arrive on the right of the formation.   They did not stay illuminated for more than aminute at a time, then would gradually fade away.   I witnessed this happen twice, approximately 5-10 minutes apart.    It was approxomately 9:45 pm Pacific time, 95 degrees with no wind and no cloud cover.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Fluid formation flying disks.;2017-02-21 11:15:00;10 minutes;Fluid formation flying disks. My sister and I initially thought we were witnessing a bird migration, but the elevation was too high to be birds.  We then witnessed what looked like 10 circular craft, that were light in color, possible light silver or white, and were reflective, begin moving in a fluid formation that was like nothing we have ever witnessed.  They bobbed and weaved within one another so fluidity that we were sure we couldn't be witnessing anything man made.  They flew in this fluid formation for 10 minutes then completely disappeared.  There were no clouds in the sky for them to disappear into, and it was perfect weather with very little wind.  My sister and I were driving north on our way home from running errands and we turned west and watched them until they disappeared.  When we arrived home, we saw fighter jets flying around our area.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
