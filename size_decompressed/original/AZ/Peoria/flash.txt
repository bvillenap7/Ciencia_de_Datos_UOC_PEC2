Quick moving ball of light in NW Phoenix Valley;2011-01-14 22:05:00;1 second;Quick moving ball of light in NW Phoenix Valley Though our front (south facing) window, we saw a ball of light fly though the sky.  It moved almost at the speed of a shooting star, but was EXTREMELY bright.  Additionally, it was no more than 5000 feet in the air.  There was no sound.  We ran outside immediately after seeing the object, and there was no sign of a vapor trail or the craft. Again, this was FAR too bright and large to be a shooting star.  The light was not a fireball light, like a meteor, but was more so a self-contained light.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
