Dark triangle-shaped craft silently moved over house, traveling from north to south.;1992-02-13 05:45:00;2 minutes;Dark triangle-shaped craft silently moved over house, traveling from north to south. I awoke and felt compelled to go to my bedroom window and immediately noticed a stark black triangle-shaped craft just above our home traveling in a north-south trajectory, rather slowly.   It seemed completely silent and had steady glowing red lights on the bottom along the sides of the craft.   It appeared to be quite large, not like an airplane but much larger by far.   It was in the pre-dawn hours of the morning, and the sun had not yet risen.   I watched the craft approach the horizon and disappear from view.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

What I figured was landing lights looked strange, the light where a dull white in color where pointing down or out not forward and they where in a perfect triangle shape and there was no other marker or formation lights on this object. This sighting only lasted about 5 seconds and then it went back into the clouds. I been thinking about this all day and I figure this was no conventional aircraft because when normal aircraft are on approach to land in the rain you can usually make out the beams of landing light pointing forward in the rain, this object lights didn't do that.  I have a background in aviation and have spend 20 years in the military working on F-15 and F-16 aircraft I've watch many night time landings in the rain and this was completely different.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Many sightings of 12 orange lights, bouncing + pattern formation, high rate of acceleration 8:34 PM on 10/12/05;2005-10-12 20:32:00;4 Minutes;Many sightings of 12 orange lights, bouncing + pattern formation, high rate of acceleration 8:34 PM on 10/12/05 At 8:34 PM on 10/12/05 my wife and I were driving South on 67th Ave near Cactus Road in Peoria, AZ when we both noticed what appeared to be orange balls in a vertical V formation, approximately 1/2 mile from us with the lowest ball being about 400 feet off the ground.  The balls were moving very slowly in an UPWARD direction.   My mother lives about a mile south of Cactus Rd so I phoned her and asked her to go outside. Within 20 seconds, the lights went out of sight and by the time she ran to the front yard, she saw two fighter jets and one of the balls bounced up and down, and shot straight upwards towards the sky and disappeared.  We drove around for a few more minutes but could not find them again.   Within three minutes I called 1411 (information) for channel 3 news (KTVK) and reported the incident. The investigator there at channel 3 told me that there have been numerous reports of these lights all over the Phoenix valley tonight.  The news reporter told me they were spotted near Scottsdale, Apache Junction, and Peoria. The news reporter also told me that they were catching footage of the lights and that the 10 o'clock news would cover this.  At 10:20 PM I decided to call the news station because the lights were not being mentioned. I spoke with the same news reporter again, and this time he told me that they did not get footage and there would be no news story.  He added that some reports noted fighter jets dropping flares, and after dropping the flares, the lights would shoot off in various directions or straight up towards the sky.  The news reported added that they get many reports of these lights, as many as two each and every day.  There's just something strange about this! These were NOT flares, NOT helicopters, NOT jet airplanes, NOT lightening balls, or anything else that would be easy to explain.  The objects made no noise, were amber colored light a sulfur street light, bounced up and down, made formations, and accelerated at high speeds.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

Looks like a starship out of SciFi movie;2014-10-04 16:15:00;45 minutes;looks like a starship out of SciFi movie Notice a small light in the sky holding stationary at the 12 o'clock pos.  Took a look with my binoculars it didn't look to be spherical got the 4 1\2 telescope and looked at it.  It looks like it has structure shapes and it was triangle shape with some reflective surfaces. While trying to lock on to this object with the scope noticed a red dot (not illuminated but looked to painted red) off to right of the main objects.  The main object behaved like a balloon but looked nothing like any balloon I have ever seen thru my scope.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

The craft hovered for about 5 minutes making no noise and maintaining a perfect altitude.  It was not a conventional air craft and was not flairs being dropped.  I was in my back yard looking out towards Luke air force base and I am positive it was no aircraft of ours.  The lights were spherical in nature and were brighter then the construction lights at the near by gravel mine.  I'm very concerned about this.  All of the dogs and coyotes were going crazy.  I also filmed the craft.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Big triangle flew over my house!;2016-04-18 23:00:00;2 minutes;Big Triangle flew over my house! I noticed two series of red lights curved like a baseballs seams so I watched it fly directly over my house, I could only make out the triangle for a split second.  It sounded like one of the quiet military aircraft that frequents my area.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748

The tag along glided back and forth, east to west a couple times.  The entire thing was traveling south to north.  All lights were dim, no sound, traveling in a straight line, and very low in the sky.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
