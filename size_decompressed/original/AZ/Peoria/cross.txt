Clear day object appeared then disappeared;2020-05-25 12:15:00;2;Clear day object appeared then disappeared Saw a white cross shaped figure in the sky, thought it may have been a bird at first,  object was flying NW and never “flapped it’s wings” as birds do. It was flying in a straight line. No engine noise like a plane. Object disappearing into the sky, no clouds. No other birds or objects around it. The sky was clear blue and it just disappeared into the sky. Definitely not a bird or a plane;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
