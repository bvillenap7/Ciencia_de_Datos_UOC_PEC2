3 spherical objects hovering close together in the sky then leaving area;1985-06-30 16:00:00;5;3 spherical objects hovering close together in the sky then leaving area My mother, father, and myself were sitting in the spa in our backyard when my father caught sight of something in the sky to our west.  He drew our attention to 3 spherical objects hovering in the western part of the sky from our home.  The objects just hovered there for what seemed like several minutes before departing at a fairly high rate of speed to the south and disappearing.  No sound was noted by any of us from these objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
8 orange balls move across the sky.;2013-11-11 20:30:00;15 minutes;8 orange balls move across the sky. At approximately 8:30 pm me and a friend were outside facing the N.W. when 2 orange lights bigger than a quarter came across the sky.  They were parallel to each other and traveling at the same speed.  I ran inside and got my 3 other roomates came out and they continued moving south together.  There was no noise at all nor blinking lights like seen on every aircraft in the sky.  Then when the first two started fading out to the far south another two lights appeared in the same location as the first.  They followed the same flight path as the first two and by this time a neighbor had come out and witnessed the second pair. We could not hear any noise at all from them.  Then when those two were in the south 4 more of the same lights came from the exact location but they came one at a time along the first flight path.  The lights all disappeared when they got in the southern part of the sky.  I've seen aircraft in the sky but this was definitely not a helicopter flares or airplanes.  I called 2 news stations and searched endlessly to see if any explanation could be found.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
