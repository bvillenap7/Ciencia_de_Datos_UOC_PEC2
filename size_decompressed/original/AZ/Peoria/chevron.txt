Slow moving chevron-shaped object with multiple lights over our house moving north-south;1997-03-13 20:45:00;5 minutes;Slow moving chevron-shaped object with multiple lights over our house moving north-south I was 16-years-old and our family (myself and my parents) lived in Peoria, Arizona at the time, just off of 75th Avenue and Peoria Ave.   I believe it to be nearly 8:15 P.M. when I walked outside, anticipating the arrival of a friend from school.  Movement caught my peripheral vision, causing me to look up.  What I noticed surprised me a great deal.  Over my head, traveling quite slowly at, I'd estimate maybe 20mph, was a very large seemingly solid V-shaped object, marked at intervals by slightly yellowish-whitish round lights.  I was so taken aback by this silent figure, I stared very intently and noticed that in between these lights, it was not possible to see stars, which, to me, indicated that the lights were part of some craft, which I had never before seen.  It was a very clear night, and stars were visible in other parts of the sky.   I was so surprised, I turned around and walked back through our courtyard to get my father, who I was certain could conf! irm what I was seeing.  I walked in and explained to him what I saw and that he needed to come outside, but by the time we both arrived back in the courtyard, the lights were much further away and we couldn't examine it further.   My friend later arrived and stated that he, too, had seen the strange formation of lights and watched it disappear on the horizon to the south, which had been the direction it was traveling when I'd stood beneath it.   I'd estimate that it was maybe 800-1,000 feet above me, but shockingly silent.  I could hear no motor, no propulsion of any kind while standing beneath it as it made its trek from north to south over me.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
