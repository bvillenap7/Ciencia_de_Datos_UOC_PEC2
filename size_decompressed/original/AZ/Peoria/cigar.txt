Surprised by diffuse appearing object.;2019-05-05 08:30:00;10 seconds;Surprised by diffuse appearing object On Sunday, May 5th, I was on my boat at Lake Pleasant, Arizona.  I had spent the night on the boat and was almost ready to go back to the dock.  I was about ¼ mile north of the 4 lane launch ramp at the north end of the lake.  At 8:30 am I was drifting with a slight breeze from the north, pushing me toward the dock to the south.  I had a line in the water, fishing, with a large brimmed hat and polarized sunglasses.  The weather was sunny and clear, typical Arizona. I glanced up, looking south, and noticed what I at first thought might be some spiderwebs caught between my fishing rods, which were mounted on either side of the console.  Whatever it was, it was diffuse, and somewhat hard to distinguish, much like the sun looks glinting off spiderwebs.  Its relative size was about that of a full moon, about the size of an aspirin tablet at arm's length.  It was completely stationary.  After a few seconds I thought what I was seeing might be some reflection hitting my sunglasses.  I moved my head up and down, trying to determine where a reflection might be coming from.  At that moment the object moved on a level horizontal path toward the west, out of my visual range, in a fraction of a second.  The acceleration was so great that by the time the object had moved to the right edge of my vision, I could no longer track it.  At that moment I realized what I had witnessed.  There were some people in kayaks, a couple of guys fishing and some other boats to the north and east of my position. The environment was quiet, and I heard absolutely nothing that could be associated with the object – it was completely silent. I would estimate that it was about 40 degrees in elevation and on a bearing of 180 to 200 degrees. Object size and distance were impossible to determine. The object appeared somewhat like two slightly elongated top hamburger buns, with the bottom bun inverted. There was a slight darker band separating the top and bottom sections. Width to height was about 3 to 1. The overall impression was that of a light weight, white fabric, almost with some translucent quality to it. I did not detect anything unusual looking through my polarized sunglasses.  I am an experienced UFO researcher, yet it was not until the object shot out of sight that I realized what I had seen.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Update to Peoria report 03/25/2021;2021-03-25 19:40:00;1 minute;Update to Peoria report 03/25/2021 I wanted to provide update to the report I submitted on 03/25/21. I have been searching the internet on and off for days trying to find a video or picture of the object I saw. I finally came across it. There is a video on YouTube from Feb 2021 of an object over Egypt, I know this sounds to sci fi conspiracy theory like- for it to be over Egypt and by the pyramids, I would have a hard time believing someone who told me this, but this is what I saw! The YouTube video is titled- Caught on Tape 2021 - UFO 2021 - Giant Cigar Shaped Unidentified Object Over Pyramids in Giza, and was reported as MUFON case 74975.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Large  object with multiple white lights- Peoria Az;2021-03-25 19:40:00;1 minute;Large  object with multiple white lights- Peoria Az Driving home from the store, at 87th and deer valley I saw a large craft that took up over half of my drivers side window flying silently over me, I was heading east, the object was heading south. Stunned and driving I looked repeatedly to see if there were any blinking lights. All lights were solid bright white light 6-8. At first I thought maybe it was an airliner flying really low, but the object was traveling really slow, and again only white non blinking lights. It appeared to be 2 forward, 1 recessed, 2 forward 1 recessed, 2 forward. I couldn’t get a solid visual on shape. I am reporting this, curious to see if others report something. There was a decent amount of traffic while this happened. Feel free to contact me if you have additional questions.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
Large cigar shaped, low flying craft with solid lights spotted in Peoria, AZ;2021-03-25 19:45:00;2 minutes;Large cigar shaped, low flying craft with solid lights spotted in Peoria, AZ My wife and I were driving home on W Beardsley Rd approaching N 107th Ave in Peoria. Right after crossing over N Lake Pleasant Rd, I notice what I thought at first, was multiple aircraft flying way too low. Since I was focused on driving, I told my wife to roll her window down to take a closer look. There was no sound and the non-blinking lights were solid white. That's when we noticed it was a single larger craft with multiple lights. They were bright but a soft bright if that makes sense. We briefly lost sight of the craft before turning right on 107th Ave and then briefly saw it again. It would have been heading towards W Deer Valley Rd which is where I see that someone else also reported a similar sighting.  I would have entered this sooner but had convinced myself it must have explainable somehow. I saw something unmistakable last night (4/5/2021), which prompted me to review this reporting site. Once I saw that someone else had reported exactly what we saw in the same area at the same time, I went back to my email to double check my COVID shot email time stamp. Sure enough, that puts us there on the same date/same time.;33.6506157480315;-112.23194015748
