Triangle Craft seen over Phoenix Az was seen first over Douglas Az flying North. ((NUFORC Note:  Date unknown.  PD));1997-03-13 00:00:00;30'+;Triangle Craft seen over Phoenix Az was seen first over Douglas Az flying North. While watching stars at night, broad wing Triangle passed overhead blocking out all stars. moving very slow, inch by inch. I thought it was military or Border Patrol..Wing angle was more wide than other drawings I've seen.. Years later read report of Phoenix Triangle. I saw same craft, same date, No lights, no sound, no special feeling about it.. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thanks for speedy reply.. the date was most likely Mar/13/1997..As I wrote.  I got bored watching the thing covering up my stars.. I went to bed and forgot about it.. until years latter I happened upon your site and read about the Phoenix sighting.. I saw it over Douglas.. Big! covered whole of my sky. Low altitude. I was next to Radio tower, 70'? , I goofed. missed a chance to say hello to a space craft.. It had to know that I was below.!?
