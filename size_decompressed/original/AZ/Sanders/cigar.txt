Cigar shaped black object spotted over Northern Arizona town;2003-12-10 07:00:00;5 minutes;Cigar shaped black object spotted over Northern Arizona town I was driving to work in the early morning in the twilight just before dawn.  I saw a light in the sky as I was driving east.  It was as bright as Venus or Jupiter. It got bright and then dimmed altogether.  What was left hanging unmoving in the sky was a grey/black cigar shaped vehicle with a bump on the top.  I watched it as I pulled into the parking lot.  I thought if it was an airplane, it would keep moving.  It just hung there.  I kept watching it for a few more minutes and it never moved.  The color was odd for an airplane in this area as well.  I don't recall seeing a plane that was black/ grey and did not reflect light off of it.  It made no noise whatsoever.;35.2168;-109.3386
