Dark unlit aircraft passes at low altitude;2001-09-25 04:20:00;10=15 seconds;Dark unlit aircraft passes at low altitude I was sitting on the patio of my apartment enjoying the quiet of the early morning, the sky and the stars.  Suddenly a small cloud appeared directly to my north.  I thought where did that come from since it was a cloudless night.  Then I noticed it was moving and realized it couldn't be a cloud.  As I followed the movement it became black against the dark sky moving south directly toward me.  There were no lights visible on the aircraft.  It was moving in a direct flight path.  As it passed overhead at an altitude of not more than 1,000 feet, I leaned over the wall of my patio to see the reflection of the lights in our parking lot hit the bottom of the aircraft.  It refkected a dark gray metal and v-shaped.  I cannot positively say it was triangular.  There was absolutely no sound as it passed overhead nor afterward.  My thoughts were What the hell was that thing? As I sat contemplating what I had so quickly witnessed, I thougt at first it might be a glider plane. In the wake of recent events, I thought maybe the terrorists are going to use gliders next.  But even gliders make a noise as they swish by!  Then I thought of how the object must have appeared as a cloud at first.  Our town has no street lights.  It is relatively dark.  One half mile away there is a small plaza with a lit parking area amd a senior apartment complex with a lit parking area.  This craft must have reflected those lights as it passed over. When it passed over the empty lot across the street was when it beame black on black.  I did not report this to anyone as I was waiting to here of another siting by someone. But this has been preying on my mind all week.  I don't think a military craft would be permitted to fly so low with no lights over a populated area.  I don't even know if we have silent aircraft.  That is what I question most of all was the silence and no lighting.;33.6077071428571;-111.722564285714

White lights flashing in my window;2010-05-11 04:00:00;1/2 minute;White lights flashing in my window About 4:00Am I got out of bed to use the bathroom, while there I noticed a white light flashing in the bathroom, I got up looked out my bathroom window on the 2nd floor of my house and saw a triangular silver craft over the one story home across the street, flying very low and slow to the north west. This craft was so low it was flashing in my window.  It had white lights and one red. I could see it was silver color.  It was very low and was traveling very slow. I ran to get my glasses to see better detail, when I returned it was gone.  I am not aware of any craft that looks like what I saw, that flies so low and slow that I could see the lights flashing in my window and the craft itself.  Before I looked out the window I thought it was a police car flashing it light at my house or someone walking their dog with a flash light being we haven't any street lights in my neighborhood.  People often walk their dogs before the sun comes up to avoid the heat. Later that day, I called the FH police department and the FH newspaper and nobody else had called in saying they saw the craft then I thought to google and got this site.
