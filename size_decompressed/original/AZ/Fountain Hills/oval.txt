Craft are dark perhaps black with no visable lights and move from spot to spot very quickly.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-29 19:00:00;15 minutes;Craft are dark perhaps black with no visable lights and move from spot to spot very quickly. These craft are seen several nights per week over McDowell mountain park in the area that borders the north west corner of the town of Fountain Hills and the Eastern slopes of the McDowell Mountains.  This area is very dark with virtually no light polution. Any resident living in this area that borders the park can or has seen them, their are perhaps 100 homes in the area that back up to the park.  One simple explanation might be the Apache Longbow helicopter manufacturing plant about 15 miles south of the park I have seen them their many times running in silent mode, this is a test area for them, however day's and times of testing can be verified.  These craft don't move like a helicopter and and have no visible rotors, when viewed with night vision equipment they are longer and more oval shaped and they disappear straight up or at an angle and disappear out of sight in seconds, they have no visable exterior lights, they are just black objects against the night sky, they rarely ever appear on nights when the moon shines bright.
