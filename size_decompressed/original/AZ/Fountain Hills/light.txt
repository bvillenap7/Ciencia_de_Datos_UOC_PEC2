Orb over Fountain Lake.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the small green orb is a lens flare.  PD));2015-02-01 08:00:00;Unk;Orb over Fountain Lake. I took a picture of the sun raising over Fountain Lake with my iPhone 6.  When I posted the picture To Facebook, I noticed the blue/greenish orb to the south of the sun.  I am not aware of any tall features in that area of the park that would reflect the sun, so thought I'd send it to you. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the small green orb is a lens flare.

rotating colored light on a mountain top;2020-09-25 22:30:00;20 minutes;rotating colored light on a mountain top While traveling south on hwy 87 at approximately 22:30 hours and just north of Fountain Hills AZ I first spotted what looked like a police stopped vehicle ahead of me a couple miles when I came to Sycamore Creek and Hwy 87 at the Log Coral Wash area.  As I approached I then noticed the lights were not a police vehicle but a stationary light on a hill that was changing color from red to green then blue.  I could see the outline of the top of the hill and knowing the area well there are no roads that take you to the top of this hill.  I pulled over to get a video of the light and it appeared to be sitting on the ground as I could see the outlines of boulders around it.  I recorded this for approximately 30 seconds with the light changing colors and you can see vehicles tail lights below it on the highway. This area is approximately near mile marker 212-213 on Hwy 87;33.6077071428571;-111.722564285714
