Fireballs, silent, appear in Arizona skies.;2015-01-18 19:00:00;20 minutes;Fireballs, silent, appear in Arizona skies. 2 Fireballs seen over Fountain Hills, AZ.  Poorly photographed with my phone.   The fireballs flew approximately 1500 meters overhead, from east to west, making absolutely no sound.  They were a bright red/orange color and they flew in the same path, hovered briefly then continued on until making a sharp ascent disappearing into the night sky.   I see them often, they are not planes (no navigation beacons) they do not follow the standard flight paths, they are not helicopters, nor are the lanterns, flares, or fireworks.   I am not sure what they are and I am both fascinated and maybe little frightened by them.  They appear more often now than in past years.;33.6077071428571;-111.722564285714
