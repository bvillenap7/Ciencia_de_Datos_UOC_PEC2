Hovered about minut or so traveling west by southwest turning into no other description than  a star of Bethlehem shape of yellowish color then turned into a satellite or star shaoe cirle travelling in south by southwest direction at a spped a little faster than observed airplanes observed that evening until out of eyesight.   Not very windy and in my mind, I have ruled out someone implementing a Cincinnati fire and a afterburn from a military jet or meteor.;33.6077071428571;-111.722564285714
Multiple orbs, formations, triangle and fireballs seen, as well as lunar and atmospheric anomalies.;2014-08-10 23:00:00;4 hours;Multiple orbs, formations, triangle and fireballs seen, as well as lunar and atmospheric anomalies. On August 10th, 2014, at approximately 11:00 (23:00), I was pointing out the triangle mothership that is in the NE sky, when to the East was a shape-shifting constellation. There were approximately 6 stars that shifted from a stem with bulb formation, to a polygon, and a straight line. Meanwhile, in the NE sky and the SE sky, two stars were syncing flashes. Red, Blue, Green. We then approached the West side of the building, and there witnessed more activity than I have ever seen.  In the NW, there was a red cloud, where 40+ orbs were dogfighting and making extreme maneuvers.  As this went on, there was a two light formation that went against the cloud movement at an incredible speed then stopped. At this time, two neighbors came out and asked what we were doing, to which we pointed out.  Needless to say, they were in awe. At approximately 1:00 am, the moon started flashing bright white circles in an increasingly fast pattern, till a wave of white crossed the moon and ensconced the moon in a white light brighter than anything I've seen.  It was almost as if the moon was activated. The cloud formations at this time became extremely detailed, to the point 4 people all saw the exact images simultaneously.  These were groups of human faces, most with looks of horror, and always with a Grey face behind them. At 1:22 am a triangular shape (think the flux capacitor) flashing in a haphazard pattern red appeared in the WNW sky, and approached us on a SE course.  This object flew at incredible speeds for being that high up, and only produced a low hum.  As it passed over the building we were all viewing from, it cast a white light over the building, then disappeared in a flash.;33.6077071428571;-111.722564285714
