I spent New Years eve watching movies at my parent's house while they were out at a local restraunt for the new years eve party.  I was pretty bored that night and i believe i was watching X-men for the first time. Well, the couch i was sitting on was by our Windows that face the front of the house, facing south. For some reason i had the odd feeling something was over the house, maybe because i heard something, but i had the urge to look out that window... so I quickly opened the blinds to look outside, and there was a craft flying from over my house towards the small mountains. You could see it fly that way because the lights from the city behind the mountains helped to sort of give an outline to the shape of whatever was flying overhead.  At first i thought it was just a helicopter flying over the house, heading back towards the city, but afterwards i asked myself why in the world would it be so low. It seemed like it was only 100-200 feet above the house as it flew past, and when it went over the mountains, it just barely flew over the edge of them. No lights were visible, and so i said, that was either a UFO or a military plane flying really low over the town.  My last thought about it before i went back to my movie was, Hey, that's illegal to fly that low anyways! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes himself as a member of the U.
