Triangular UFO seen in Fountain Hills, AZ;2002-01-10 03:00:00;15 seconds;Triangular UFO seen in Fountain Hills, AZ At precisely 3:00 am I saw a bright light in my front yard.  I looked out my window and saw a triangular craft hovering over my street with red and yellow lights moving around the shape of the craft.  I watched it for approximatly fifteen seconds.  I then went outside to incestigate this (I'm a big fan of the X-Files).  I walked out out garage door and up the spiral staircase to our roof.  Once I got up there it had already left.  I stayed up there for about 10 minutes and saw a little flash as if something was leaving our atmosphere.;33.6077071428571;-111.722564285714
