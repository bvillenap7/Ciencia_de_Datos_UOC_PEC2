6 bright lights near Mesquite Nv.;2007-12-03 18:45:00;2-3 minutes;6 bright lights near Mesquite NV. Near the town of Beaver Dam/littlefield Az. area, my wife observed what she called a strange bright light to the north of the town.  I replied that I did not see it, but she was very insistent that she had seen it and I just chuckled and turned on to the on ramp and proceeded towards Mesquite Nevada.  When I noticed to my right a ball of light that caught my attention and I told my wife to look. We immeadiately seen it again and it became very bright and then dimmed out.  I pulled the truck over to the right and turned on my emergency light and we sat there and watched.   Sure enough we seen it again and to our astonishment we seen atleast 5 to 6 more light up one at a time in rapid succesion from right to left, one after the other.  We were very excited and sat for about ten more minutes trying to see them again but did not.  I am reporting this in hopes someone else seen them. I have never seen anything like it before and I hope to see something like that again. ((name deleted));36.8856;-113.9275
Light makes erratic movements over northern AZ and southern UT.;2013-12-29 06:00:00;1 hour;Light makes erratic movements over northern AZ and southern UT. Looking out my bedroom window towards St. George just before sunrise on 12/29/13 I noticed a very bright star I had not seen before in that sector of the sky.  As I continued watching, it made some erratic movements that would be impossible for a plane or chopper.  At first I thought it may just be my eyes playing tricks on me from focusing so long and intently on one spot.   When I heard my son (49 yrs old) moving around in the kitchen, I called him to look at it.  He confirmed that it was indeed moving erraticaly and making 90 degree turns that are impossible for conventioal aircraft.  Shortly after that I asked my wife to watch it and tell me what she saw.  Confirmation again!  She saw the same thing.  My question is whether anyone else has reported these events to someone.;36.8856;-113.9275
