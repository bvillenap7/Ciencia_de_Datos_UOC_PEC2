Bright Green diamond shaped craft with red around it crashes somewhere by the gorge leading to St. George Utah;2009-04-25 22:45:00;45 seconds;Bright Green diamond shaped craft with red around it crashes somewhere by the gorge leading to St. George Utah My boyfriend and I were driving through the desert looking for a place to park and talk.  We were above beaver dam az on a hill top facing towards the gorge that leads to St. George Ut.  When all of a sudden I saw this diamond or tearshaped thing going diagonally across the sky but headed downward quickly.  It was such a bright green and I'm talking bright bright green  with a ring of red around it.  Then it passed behind the mtns and we saw a huge flash (explosion) and it was gone.  I couldnt believe my eyes and neither could my boyfriend.  We heard no noise however when it crashed...all we saw was a huge flash of red and orange which led us to believe that whatever it was crashed into the earth.  It was incredibly amazing and I would love to find out more information as to where the crash site would be because if it was in the gorge it would be difficult to locate, but I am willing to investigate it.;36.8856;-113.9275
