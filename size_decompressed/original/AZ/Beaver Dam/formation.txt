Two balls of orange light appear and disappear, then turn into three balls of light.;2008-10-29 20:00:00;1 min;Two balls of orange light appear and disappear, then turn into three balls of light. I was on my way home from picking up my 12 year old son from scouts.  We live in a smaill town in the Northwest corner of Arizona, what is called the Arizona strip.  We came up to the top of the hill to make the turn to our house which is down a road and then a small hill.  We were making the turn when I saw what at first appeared a bright white ball with a small red light on the end.  This ball then turned orange.   Just as the first ball turned orange another ball appeared to the left, this was orange as well.  This appeared to seperate from the first ball.  Both balls of light then disappeared.   My son and I pulled over and rolled down the window.  We were stunned.   Just then both appeared again as we were watching them the ball of light on the left be came three balls and you could almost discern a shape.  We watched this briefly and then they were gone.   My son said he saw them fly away, I am not sure I saw that, however, we both saw these balls of light.;36.8856;-113.9275
