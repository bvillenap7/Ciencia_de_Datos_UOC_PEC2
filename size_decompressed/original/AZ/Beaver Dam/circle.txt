It was coming towards me slowly getting closer and then it turned and slowly disappeared as if it were like magic.   Didn't think much of it at the time but returning that same evening two hours later the same orange light was in almost the same spot as before but closer and moving towards me.   My daughter was also with me and she asked what it was and i said that i didn't know.  So i stopped the car, and shut off the lights, and we watched it for about two minutes before it stopped and hung there for a couple of seconds before slowly starting to ascend straight up into the sky and then disappeared again.   It was very strange and we're not sure what to make of it.;36.8856;-113.9275
