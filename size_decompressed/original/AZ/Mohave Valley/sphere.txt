It was very bright low on the horizon.   At first I thought it was a planet or star, but as soon as I looked hard it moved slow at first to the right, then accelerated sideways, then stopped and barely moving.  My wife at this time also witnessed the object.   We tried to film it but it was to far in the distance.

After observing the UFO for twenty minutes, or so, it just vanished.;34.8961;-114.6
