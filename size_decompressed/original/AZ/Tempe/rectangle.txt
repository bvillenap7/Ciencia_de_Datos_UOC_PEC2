Stationary rectangular object seen on a cloudy night in Tempe, AZ.;2010-11-01 20:00:00;5 minutes;Stationary rectangular object seen on a cloudy night in Tempe Arizona My wife and stepson were in my back yard hot tub.  It was partially overcast with low scattered clouds with a slight drizzle of rain.  I looked up at the sky towards the south and saw a rectangle hovering in the sky.  It seemed to be illuminated with a light grey color by the passing clouds along with the reflective light from the city lights.  I would say that I would not have seen it if it wasn't for the low scattered clouds passing through and around it.  The rectangle was perfectly stationary and I would guess that it was about a couple miles away and several thousand feet up in the sky.  The angle from my position was that it was facing east with about a 25 to 35 degree angle to the north.  What was odd was that it wasn't only perfectly still, but the clouds seemed to pass through the object.  It also appeared to have no depth like it was paper thin.  However, it looked like a solid object.  We watched it for around 5 minutes and the whole time it was perfectly stationary. Then the clouds got thicker and it disappeared in the clouds.  When I was looking at it, I couldn't wrap my mind around what I was seeing.  The most unusual aspect to this is that my wife and I never talked about it  up until around a year ago.  Before I saw the object, I was probably the biggest UFO skeptic there was, but lately, I have been re-thinking this.  I have been doing some research on the subject and have yet to find any UFO sighting like what we saw.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
