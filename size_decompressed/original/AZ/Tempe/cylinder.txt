Noontime sighting on a sunny, cloudless day of a long, brightly glaring craft that disappears from view.;2003-04-08 12:05:00;1 minute or so;Noontime sighting on a sunny, cloudless day of a long, brightly glaring craft that disappears from view. I was meeting my sister for lunch at 12:15 PM.  I was driving south on S. Hardy Drive towards Baseline.  The day was sunny, the sky was blue, and there was no haze or clouds in the sky. Just as I was coming up to the Hwy 60 overpass I glanced up and saw what I first thought was a jet airplane.  It was right above the center of my steering wheel moving slowly to the right within the frame of my windshield.  Unfortunately, the sighting didn't appear out of the ordinary at first and occurred so quickly that I didn't think to try and take a measurement.  However, from my position in the driver's seat, I would estimate that if I pointed my thumb up, with my arm straight out in front resting on the steering wheel, the aircraft would have been as wide as my thumb.  As I continued to drive, I switched my gaze back & forth being mindful of the road while checking out the object as well.  It appeared to be elongated like a passenger jet would be, but I couldn't make out the specific features due to the bright, silvery glint that was reflecting off of it.  My first thought was that the sun was reflecting off the aircraft at just the right angle for it to create such a glare.  As I continued to look up at it I noticed that the glare began to diminish, and along with it, the aircraft slowly faded from view.  Completely.  I kind of shook my head and thought if the glare slowly faded because the angle had changed due to the forward movement of the aircraft, shouldn't I have had a clearer view of it rather than no view of it?  I searched the sky briefly in the direction it had been flying, but there was nothing there.  Then from the view on the right side of my windshield, traveling to the left, I could see the narrow contrail of another jet (but not the jet itself) high in the sky, as one normally sees contrails when a jet flys high over a city.  (30,000 feet perhaps?)  At that point I realized that the craft I first saw must have been flying much lower because I could definitely see that it was some! type of aircraft, long and shining brightly, however it did not have a contrail…and it dissolved away from view.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

Stark white object flying over Tempe Arizona in strange non-linear aeronautical movements.;2007-07-22 14:00:00;40 seconds;Stark white object flying over Tempe Arizona in strange non-linear aeronautical movements.

At first glance, it appeared in its flying “behavior”* to be almost kite like, moving very slowly in a very mild zigzag type of formation slowly rising upwards. The objects shape was somewhat circular** and its color was stark white. The object’s location was NNE in the sky and about 65 – 70° from the horizon. The size of the object in the sky was about as big as the head of a large nail, or the circumference of a regular drinking straw.  Event: As I was standing outside smoking a cigarette, I noticed in the sky an object that appeared upon first glance to be drifting in the wind. The movement of the object appeared to be in a gentle upward rising zigzag motion towards the NNE direction. Upon 10 seconds of observation, the object made what appeared as a semi-circular loop type of movement sending it further upwards toward a small cloud in the sky. The object passed behind the cloud, hesitated, did another semi-circular loop changing direction towards the NNW again yet maintaining an upward rising movement. The movements of the object itself were not in any way angular, jarring, or sudden all of its movements were extremely gentle and graceful. At about 25-30 seconds of observation, after coming out from behind the cloud (the cloud itself was dense, yet allowed enough light to pass through it allowing a fairly unobstructed view of the objects flight through the cloud itself) the object appeared to pick up speed moving in a more distinct westerly direction in a more linear flight pattern. It was after that that I ran into my home to grab my camera, by the time that I came back outside the object was completely gone.  * By behavior, I am referring to the way the object moved through the sky itself.  ** The shape of the object appeared to be circular with other features that seemed to be somewhat angular. Unfortunately, the object was far enough in the air that a detailed description of its features are difficult to describe.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Amber/Red-colored Chinese lanterns;2012-03-02 22:00:00;15 seconds;Amber/Red-colored Chinese lanterns Roughly around 10pm, I was driving west on I-60. Either just east or west of I-101, I looked out my driver's side window (which was closed at the time) and spotted 2 amber/red cylinders floating above the 15ft+ barrier wall that aligned outer edge of east-bound lanes.  I opened my window to get a better look while I slowly began to pass them.  They looked like small (~2 ft diameter) Chinese lanterns. Light emitted from an orb-like mass in the middle of each lantern the outter cylinder-shaped body seemed to be lit by this orb. I could tell neither the orbs nor the lanterns were made-up of no ordinary light because they were radiant yet soft, dense hi-def but misty. Hard to explain. They gently floated along and shifted positions (in relation to each other). Then I saw one lantern float into the other, merging into 1 cylinder (which maintained its  size). I continued to keep my eye on them/it (and the road...) but eventually the rubbernecking reached an uncomfortable angle. I turned off at the next exit and flipped around, but they/it were/was gone. The reason why I'm not sure if they were amber or red is because I remember them being both of those colors (together, i.e. they matched) yet I have no recollection of noticing them change one second they were amber and the next they were red, and I have no idea how they pulled off that fast one. They were pretty. Seemed to have an air of intelligence about them. Just got that kind of vibe.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
