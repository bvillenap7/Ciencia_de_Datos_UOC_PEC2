Unexplained light cast into otherwise dark area blasts out of sight.;1985-05-15 22:00:00;20+Min;Unexplained light cast into otherwise dark area blasts out of sight. Was sitting between a large two story house,and a twelve foot high block wall with two other persons.  Decided to play some cards. played for a few minuites before realizing for the first time that we were playing by light that was being cast out from behind a large cottonwood tree situated 10 yards away from our position. It's usually dark...but we had light to see by.   Looking up to where the light was comming from i witnessed a lighted sphere, that as my friends and i looked up at it began to wobble back and forth before shooting off to the northeast, and arching upwards out of sight in less than 2 seconds since starting to wobble.   We played cards by the light it gave off for about 20 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD));33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

BRIGHT light falling, hour later light leaving south;2004-04-28 04:00:00;2 seconds;BRIGHT light falling, hour later light leaving south Me and my friend were standing out in front of the house smoking a cigarette, I was telling him about a UFO I thought I had saw earlier in the night when all of a sudden a bright white sphere with a tail streaks about (perspective-from-ground) 5ft. through the air and dissapears instantly. The object was so close that it had lit up the whole street. If it had been a falling star that close there would have been smoke lingering in the air, I said to my friend. Eight minutes after we had seen it there was a loud, deep EXPLOSION, it didn't sound like a backfire or gunshot. We were pretty freaked out. We sat their for about an hour discussing what we had seen, trying to identify what we had seen logically, when a light that had been sitting in the sky for that whole hour, decided to just start heading south and dissapear maybe 4 seconds after it had started moving. The odd thing about it was that when it had started moving the sky was just starting to turn blue from the sun coming up. That is what my friend and I saw. Believe me, it was scary.

Tempe Az  Black Dot 10 seconds traveling N to S very fast and quite;2006-05-21 10:30:00;::15;Tempe Az  Black Dot 10 seconds traveling N to S very fast and quite As i was out on my patio looking at airplanes taking off from Phx int. airport I noticed a black dot in the sky.  I was looking almost straight up and observed it traveling from north to south, it was above a plane taking off and below a plane traveling from east to west at about 35000 ft.  It left no contrail nor did it seem to make any noise.  I called for my wife to come out and see it, but she didn't make it in time.  It was moving faster than any aircraft in the sky judging by the other aircraft speeds.  I'm prior military and have seen F-14's at mach 2, this is the only comparison i can make to the speed. It was about the size of this dot o from my vantage.  The sighting lasted about 10 seconds from zenith to 45 degrees until I lost it over the roof top of the apartment building next to ours.  It was unusual enough to raise the hairs on my arms.  This will be the third object I have seen in the Arizona sky's that I cannot explain and would have been the second for my wife.  Let me know if any body else seen this please.  Thanks ((name and e-address deleted)).;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Bright white light in the Phoenix evening sky.;2009-06-11 20:00:00;20 minutes;Bright white light in the Phoenix evening sky I was driving through Phoenix at about 20:00 June 11th, 2009.  Immediately after heading Westbound, I saw a very large sphere in the sky, that was emanating a bright white light.  It was maybe 20 degrees above the horizon, in the West-Northwest direction.  I pulled over onto a neighborhood street to watch the object and get on the phone!  I called my dad in Tempe, he had seen it in the sky about 15 minutes earlier and was watching it.  I called my mom, and after she spotted it, she grabbed the neighbors and they all watched it.  I called another friend, she and her boyfriend plus entourage all watched it while on the phone with me.  Witnesses are not a problem!  I watched the object for about 15 minutes before it disappeared.  It was far too large and bright to be a star or a planet, and it was completely motionless.  I was parked, and by comparing it to other stationary objects, houses, poles, etc, it didn’t drift or anything.  The white light was very bright, creating a sort of aura of light around it that was maybe double or triple the circumference of the central object.  In the center, it was looked like just a solid sphere of light.  After perhaps 15 minutes of watching the object, it suddenly began to look like it was moving away from my point of view.  It appeared to be moving slightly, and the white aura of light faded rapidly.  It became a bright orange color, like the color of Mars, and it’s size continued to diminish quickly.  Within about one minute, it was nothing more than a small point of light, now much like a star, and then it disappeared from sight.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
DARK YELLOW ORANGISH BALL;2011-10-14 22:30:00;5 minutes;DARK YELLOW ORANGISH BALL I was home outside my apartment in Tempe AZ near University and Hardy. looking to the north and saw what i first thought was an Airplane on fire, it was flying from the north to the south at a rate of speed that would be considered normal for a small private aircraft.  I looked at my friend asked her what that was, she looks up and says airplane, i look at it again and asked is it on fire? we both looked at it for a  while at the same time aircraft were moving east to west landing at KPHX sky harbor. So this was considerably higher than the aircraft in the pattern. As i was watching it it went from a bright orange, to a dull yellow started as a large ball as it transistioned from an angle to overhead it became more of a pin point, with a light orb that seemed transperent in nature. i couldnt take my eyes off it, it passed then outside my visual range because it went behind the structure of my apartment. I'm ex military, current airline employee i know what should be in and out of sky harbor and i have no idea what that was, i checked mufon and there was one sighting that seemed to describe what i saw but the pics they posted were not it.  would love to know if there was any other sightings of this.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Strange red-orange spherical objects travelling in single file formation in the night sky.;2013-09-15 10:30:00;10 minutes;Strange red-orange spherical objects travelling in single file formation in the night sky. I am a 39 year old female with a bachelor’s degree in nursing and one in human biology and on this approximate date of 09/15/2013 I was picking up two clients (male ASU students around the age of 21 years old) at their apartment complex.  As I was waiting outside for them to come out, I noticed several red-orange spherical lights in the sky to the south (they appeared to be in the city of Chandler, just south of Tempe).  They were traveling in sort of an arc, heading first west and then toward the north and finally north-east, at which point they just disappeared.  They moved in a single file line in almost perfect formation.  There was a helicopter traveling along with them.  I watched this for about 3 to 5 minutes before my clients came out.  When the first one came out I pointed it out and we just watched them come up on the horizon, travel in the arc motion and then disappear. By this time we could no longer see the helicopter.  The second client came out after about two minutes and we continued to watch for about 2 minutes as the last lights came and disappeared.  I took three pictures, which are very poor quality, but photographic evidence nevertheless.  We then departed the apartment complex and continued to talk about our experience for about 10 minutes until we arrived at our destination.  We thought that maybe they were Chinese lanterns and that maybe there was a wedding or some type of festival or something.  But the question of why there would be a helicopter travelling with them kept coming up and didn't make sense to any of us. About a month later, I picked up the same clients and we discussed whether any of us had researched the incident but none of us had.  We were still baffled.  On 11/28/13, I turned on Coast to Coast am on 550 AM out of Phoenix. A s soon as I turned it on they were talking about similar incidents throughout the county and identical descriptions.  Listeners were encouraged to report their incidents on the ufocenter.com website, so I thought I should.   The incident was just too strange to ignore.

Craft under intelligent control, flying in Tempe, AZ.;2015-07-04 21:29:00;30 minutes;Craft under intelligent control, flying in Tempe, AZ. Myself and a few family members went to the Tempe Town Lake festival for the fourth of July 2015.  We are enjoying our time and being very proud to be American.   About 30 seconds before the fireworks stared we noticed a red light floating around where the fireworks are about to take place.  While the show was taking place the light was stationary, then the light started moving from east to west.  The object then stopped, and changed course and headed back to its original location.   It then proceeded to move directly up and directly down, the object then started moving towards superstition mountains then disappeared.   This craft was unlike anything I have seen and I was an aircraft rescue firefighter for the United States Marine Corps.  I have seen very many aircraft from our military and other countries' military.  This was neither, nor was it civilian, and I say that because, where the craft was located was directly in the flight path of Sky Harbor Airport.   I have v! ideo;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Six orange/red orbs one by one flew over Tempe AZ new years eve 2020 over 18 min from low altitude to disappearing into space;2021-01-01 00:00:00;18 Minutes;Six orange/red orbs one by one flew over Tempe AZ new years eve 2020 over 18 min from low altitude to disappearing into space At midnight new years eve 2020, a friend and I observed six silent dark orange/red spherical glowing flying objects over an 18 minute time period. They appeared one by one, about every three minutes, from midnight to 12:18 AM. Five of the objects moved from my east to my west, and one moved from my northwest to my southeast. The first two objects were a little north of me, the second two almost directly overhead, and the last two a little south of my location. The objects first appeared at about a 40 degree angle to ground  position, and appeared about 1/5 the size of an average moon when passing over our position.  They looked like large military helicopter size, but as they steadily moved forward, away and upward, they appeared smaller and smaller, until they disappeared into space on the distant horizon.  It took about three minutes from initial sighting, at what appeared as lower altitude, to disappearance, at what appeared to we extremely high altitude.  It was difficult to estimate altitude, but I first thought the first object was a sheriff's helicopter, at low altitude, coming because of new years gunshots. Upon two of the objects, one by one, disappearance in the eastern sky, I saw four separate blue/white flashes/sparks in the dark sky, near where the objects were last seen. They looked like photo flash bulbs or sparks going off in the sky, roughly the diameter of an average moon.  I have never seen anything like that, and the sparks occurred at a very high altitude. Before the last object traveled from the NW to the SE, I ran in an grabbed my 15X x 70mm Celestron astronomical binoculars.  I was able to focus and view the last object clearly for over 10 seconds, as it was moving away.  It appeared to be reddish orange glowing perfectly spherical plasma (there was a flaming character to it), with a round white halo around it. The halo was six times the size of the ball. The halo reflected white light against some slight feathery clouds that were present. There was no trail, contrail, or exhaust coming from the object. I have worked in aerospace and defense procurement and manufacturing, for over 40 years.  I know what satellites look like in the night sky.  I know what helicopters and jet aircraft look like in the night sky. These objects were UAP, and exibited high strangeness.  I know Sky Harbor tower had to have seen the objects, but, I no longer have any FAA contacts to refer to. I waited for an hour after 12:18 AM to see if there would be further activity, and there was none.  It is worthy of note that my internet search that night found videos of orange/red orbs captured at midnight new years eve 2020 in over 10 US states, and in Autrailia, The Netherlands, The UK, Mexico, and others.  These videos match what we saw, only our sightings seemed much closer at first viewing, when the objects were at low altitude. Oddly, all the internet videos seem to have been taken at midnight their time zone, right when people were watching fireworks displays.  All the objects and descriptions of the objects seem to be very similar.  Very strange phenomenon, indeed.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
