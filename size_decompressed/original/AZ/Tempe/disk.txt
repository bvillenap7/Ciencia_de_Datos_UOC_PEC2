This object moved towards the north and eventually out of site. Right before I lost site of this object someone else pointed out another object where we originally saw the first object. We witnessed the second object for 1-3 minutes. These objects are so small it is diffeicult to estimate the altitude. The best way to describe these things with the naked eye is that they look like daytime stars. This is the first time i have submitted a report but I have been witnessing strange objects in the Phoenix skies over the last six years;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
5 lights in a saucer shape hovering and disappearing over phoenix metro area;2004-06-27 23:00:00;1hr 15min;5 lights in a saucer shape hovering and disappearing over phoenix metro area Slightly earlier in the evening, myself and at least five others were observing a row of five white lights due north of our position at rocking rodeo at Priest and Elliot rd in Tempe, AZ. It appeared to be very large and many miles north of us, about 10-15 degrees above the horizon.. the lights did not appear to be moving at all, and overall had a slightly saucer shaped silhouette. After viewing for about 15 minutes, object dissappeared instantly, only to appear 45 minutes later in the same position but not as bright, as only a saucer shaped white light.(The individual lights were not distinguishable.) Again, after a few minutes of viewing, the object instantly disappeared again. No twinkling as most aircraft lights appear through the valley smog, and it appeared and reappeared in the same position over too long a span of time to be commercial aircraft on approach to Sky Harbour airport. If it was a jet, it must have been enormous, and I can't explain its spontaneous disappearance and reappearance ... Commercial traffic to sky harbor usually clearly changes course and the lights of normal craft get dimmer but are still visible as the planes course turns away from an observer....not just disappearing. This anomaly was quite bright and visible for quite some time, 5-10 people at rocking rodeo(graham central station) viewed this.. I would have to assume elsewhere in the Phoenix metro area others witnessed it as well.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Numerous incidents over the last few months occuring over Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, AZ;2006-11-27 14:15:00;20 minutes;Numerous incidents over the last few months occuring over Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, AZ I reported this incident to MUFON at the time of the occurance on November 27th, 2006...I am re reporting here in leiu of the Chicago O'Hare airport story. I work on the Tempe/ Phoenix line at the corner of Priest and Washington Streets. This location is approximatley 3-4 miles East Northeast of Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix. My office and viewing location are directly under the landing flight path of westbound landing flights at Skyharbor. This particular occurance is a repeat and has been repeated for a total of at least 10-12 occurances at this location. On this day at approximatley 2:15 pm I was in my car in my parking lot at work. I was skywatching as I have been seeing various orbs ( black and white ), strobing cylinders , and one saucer like object for the previous 2 months. When I say 2 months that is only when I started looking at this location. The first object was a definite saucer shape..white on top and black on the bottom. The object drifted and wobbled Northeast for about 10-12 minutes at a fairly slow clip before it faded away in the sky. No sooner had the first object faded away when it was followed by a larger, white orb which was traveling slightly faster going more due east, vs northeast as the first object was going. Due to the clear sky and no reference objects in the sky..ie other planes or clouds..I could not judge the distance of the objects. They are either quite large and quite high up, or relatively small at low altitudes. They produce no noise. The are very similiar to the objects seen in CNUFOS.COM..which is done by local Phoenix resident. I have had at least 10 days observing these objects over a course of a few months. This is only given that I go out and watch one hour and day at the same time of day and even then I don't go watch every day. On any given day I will see one to three objects within a few minutes of each other. I have not seen any travel together or tandem. Since these events occur so very close to the flight paths..either takeoff or landing at one of the nations busiest airports, I am surprised there is not more investigation from local FAA authorities simply for the sake of passenger safety alone. I make no claim that these objects are extraterristial, however they do not appear to resemble any manmade objects that I am familiar seeing. Even in the event that these objects are simply  balloons  ..the frequency and proximity to a major US airport should alert someone in a position of authority to keep an active watch on the skies to avoid a potential air tragedy.  I hope this summary is helpful to other residents or aviators in the area, either on the basis of interest in the subject or minimally for air safety as a precaution.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Saucer shape, flying over Tempe, 6-7 white lights making a pattern as flew south. June 2, 2010 at apx, 9:10pm.;2010-06-02 21:10:00;5 minutes;Saucer shape, flying over Tempe, 6-7 white lights making a pattern as flew south. June 2, 2010 at apx, 9:10pm. I live near Rural Road and University, in proximity to ASU’s Tempe campus.  As two friends of mine were leaving, one got in his car and drove off, the other called for me to quickly come over and look up.  As we can only see the aircraft from one angle, below us, the object was a circle shape, so likely some kind of saucer/disk.  It’s altitude was near what typical, large commercial passenger planes reach as they are approaching landing, near Mill Avenue bridge.  The aircraft proceeded to head mostly south, in a slightly west direction.  When I witnessed the aircraft, it appeared to be 1-2 miles from me, over head.  It silently floated in the sky, as it traveled down over the rest of Tempe (until it was out of my sight). As my friend and I were watching it slowly drift away, another neighbor came outside to go to their car as well.  We called to her immediately, notifying her if she wanted to see a UFO to come quick.  She came over and watched with us, as she called her roommate to come outside.  By the time the roommate (4th witness) came outside to meet us, all he could see was the red light in the far distance (unable to tell the difference between this and another local Sky-Harbor related aircraft). To describe the object:  It had no color, maybe black, and had a red light at the tail of it that occasionally turned quickly on and off (slight flash). The front lights were a series of lights, between 6-8 white, circular lights that were all on, but one. This is hard to describe, but one light would turn off, in the row of lights, and turn back on as the next one turned off.  It repeated this pattern, across the entire row, and back again.  Resembles the kind of lighting effects that are used on games we see at the fair, or Peter Piper Pizza, for example. As I have lived in direct sight of Sky Harbor’s flight path for landing/taking off over the last 4 years, I have watched aircraft during the day and at night time.  I know what helicopters look like, and how aircraft are supposed to have one red and one green light (to indicate which direction they are flying to other aircraft) and this did not have these lights.  Like I said, the only red light was at the tail. The object moved slowly, similar to that of a police helicopter, using their search light to find a criminal.  The bright white lights making a pattern, as the object flew, was very usual, let alone unsettling.  The object made little sound, very slight puttering sound, but almost nothing at all. I am a 21 year old female, just graduated from ASU.  The other observers are one male, 22 year old, current ASU student.  The other witness, another resident at this apartment complex off 8th street and Dorsey, is about 19-20 years old.  Her roommate is male, between 21-24 years old.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Green Illuminated disc hovering over Tempe,AZ in front of Aircraft;2011-09-22 22:15:00;10 seconds;Green Illuminated disc hovering over Tempe,AZ in front of Aircraft On the evening of 9/22/2011 at Approximately 10:15 P.M.,  I was sitting over at a friends’ house, when I looked up in the sky and saw a disc shaped object just hovering to the south in the sky.  This is actually the 4th time in the past 10 years I’ve seen this same Phenomenon, and each time I’ve seen this particular object, it radiates a bright green light, and seems to move from 0-1,000 MPH in a mere second.  On this particular evening, it was hovering in the sky just miles away from an incoming passenger Aircraft (due to the fact that Sky Harbor Airport is only a few miles away). When I noticed it, it was completely stopped in mid-air.  As I watched it for a few more seconds, it started flying south bound, radiated a very bright green light in full motion, and as the green light increased in brightness, the object sped to an unbelievable speed and was completely out of sight in mere seconds.  This is in-fact the 4th time I’ve seen this Phenomenon in my lifetime! in Arizona, and I’m very convinced that these are legitimate encounters I’ve had with Extra-Terrestrial Technology.  I would really like a chance to explain my other encounters, but I thought since this was my most recent encounter (being only last night), I thought this would be a very good place to start.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
