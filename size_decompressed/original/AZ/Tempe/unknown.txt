They were nearly directly above the flight path for jets landing at Sky Harbor Airport, and appeared to be at an elevation that aircraft would need to be pressurized or at least would leave a vapor trail.  Although they seemed directly above the flight pattern for landing, I expect they were slightly north/northeast. My sense were that these objects could have been parachutes as they may seemed rectangular in shape, and since they didn't appear to be moving laterally, that's all I could think of.  While watching them for about 15 seconds, a third object appeared to the east of them but was a bright blue and of the same shape.  This third object reinforced my reasoning for thinking they were parachutes, because I could imagine that being a parachute color.  The only thing that baffled me about the parachute theory was who would attempt, or get permission to parachute in this area with such heavy airline traffic. About 10 seconds after I first noticed the blue object, it disappeared.  I didn’t see it move or actually disappear, as I was talking to a passerby about it, but when I looked back up it was gone. The remaining two objects maintained their altitude, and moved to the west at what seemed to be a relatively slow speed.  I observed them for about 50 seconds, and there were no sounds, vapor trails, etc. That's it.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Globes of light in sky over tempe arizona, moving in a quickly repeating pattern but staying in one area.;2010-07-18 01:00:00;45 mins.;globes of light in sky over tempe arizona, moving in a quickly repeating pattern but staying in one area. My husband and I were outside on our deck we watched white lights in a cloud in the sky.  There were maybe six or more.  When the cloud moved off, we couldn't see anything.   As soon as there was cloud cover again, in the same spot, the lights returned.   At first the lights moved quickly but randomly, never out of the cloud area that we could see.  Then they started a pattern, like an x or a cross pattern.  They would meet in the middle like a bump, then back out to edge of clouds then around edge to return to center over and over. They moved very quickly but stayed in same spot in the sky.  There was no noise at all.  This lasted quite awhile, off and on again, for maybe an hour.  Then when the sky had no more clouds and we couldn't see anything more and went inside.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Loud pulsating woor...woor noise shook apartment complex walls and set off car alarms at night in Tempe AZ;2011-01-17 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;Loud pulsating woor...woor noise shook apartment complex walls and set off car alarms at night in Tempe AZ On January 17 2011 My girlfriend and I were watching a movie on our computer in my two story apartment complex (we live on the first floor) and around 22:00-23:00 hours we heard a faint throbbing noise that sounded as if it was getting closer and closer. The best I can describe the noise is like a fluctuating “woor...woor....woor...woor...woor”  At first we thought it was a car with a loud speaker system but the noise got so loud that it shook the walls and windows of the apartment complex and it caused the alarm systems in the cars in the  huge parking lot to go off. After the noise reached its peak it got faint within 2 minutes and then it was gone. Our next theory was that it might have been a train but that was unlikely as the train passed by an hour after we heard the loud noise and I have never heard a train sound like that. We also thought of a low flying plane but we have never experienced that before in the 4 years we have lived at our apartment and in all the years prior to that when I lived under a flight path right by LAX . We quickly checked the news because we were concerned  about what we had experienced but neither the local news or national news reported anything. We didn't see any craft as we were so bewildered and concerned by what was going on that we didn't dare to look outside the windows. The name of the apartment complex is called Solara at Mill Avenue, Tempe, AZ;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Object with fiery tail shot off into the sky;2012-05-30 04:25:00;Second;Object with fiery tail shot off into the sky I noticed dawn was just starting to fall upon the area as I looked out through my patio doors. I was looking north through two French doors, which face east, and saw an object with an ENE or NE trajectory shoot off into the sky just above the tree line.  It looked rather similar to a meteor or firework with a very bright and rather thick orange, fiery tail (which had a bright orangish-yellow band within its core) that tapered out roughly 30 feet from the object itself. It was not a meteor, however, due to the fact that its trajectory was upward (as opposed to towards the ground) it shot into the sky at about a 45 degree angle.  I'm positive it was not a firework its tail was an extremely vivid, almost fluorescent orange, unlike anything I've seen before.   The air was still and dead silent. Its path was also slightly arched, which seemed to mimic the shape of a nearby tree canopy's silhouette. My view was obstructed by a few trees, but I got a clear shot of th! e object through a pocket of clear space between trees.   I was not able to see the object that produced the fiery tail, however, as it was much smaller than the tail itself, and traveled away much too quickly.  It seemed to be rather close though between 50-200 yards away and only 40-60 feet off the ground.   And though I cannot say with 100% certainty, I also feel the object disappeared when I lost sight of it (as opposed to me losing visibility) it just vanished, much like shooting stars do as they fall toward the ground. This occurred near sky harbor airport, beneath incoming/outgoing flight lines, yet at this early hour no incoming red-eye planes were present. The roads were quiet as well. ;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Ascending lights seen over east valley.;2013-10-09 00:15:00;10 minutes;Acending lights seen over east valley At about 1:15 am I walked out of my front door to smoke a cigarette. I live just off of the loop 202 and scotsdale road about a half mile north of the freeway.  My front door faces southeast and I am directly in the planes landing path to sky harbor in Phoenix.  I can sit on my front patio and watch planes decend all day. In my two years I have never seen a plane traveling east at the altitude and direction of the object I saw tonight.  The object was traveling east and hand a series of lights on the rear that would flash in an ascending order from left to right.  It caught my eye because, like I said, I have never witnessed a plane traveling that direction in that location before.  I quickly called my 17 year old cousin outside to look.  He was just as fascinated as me.  The lights were clearly visible and bright. I quickly hopped in my car with him and started driving east.  We followed the object for about 10 minutes and then turned around.  I have never experienced something like this in my life.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Blinking, star sized object over Tempe, AZ.;2014-07-04 20:00:00;10-15 seconds;Blinking, star sized object over Tempe, AZ. I was laying on my back in the Tempe beach park waiting for the fireworks show and looking at stars and planes flying over head.  The sky was relatively clear with scattered clouds but clear near the event I witnessed.  I noticed a blinking star in a fixed point almost directly above me.  It reminded me of the size of a satellite traveling.  The object however, did not move.  It blinked for a few seconds and went dark.   I watched around the area expecting to see it blink again in a different place as when a plane is visible or again, a satellite.  After a second or two, it began blinking again in the same spot.  It blinked for less time than when I first noticed it, then it was gone for good.  I have been a sky watcher for almost forty years and can confidently say it was too high up to have been a helicopter.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Two unusual crafts above Tempe, Arizona.  Very bright!;2014-08-25 20:00:00;10 minutes;Two unusual crafts above Tempe, Arizona.  Very bright! I was walking him from the grocery store, when I noticed a bright orange object in the sky.  I saw what looked like two streaks of light on either side but it trailed behind not changing length at all.  I thought it was a plane on fire but then thought it was flying towards the ground at a weird angle and there were no trails of smoke, or anything.  I also noticed a small object that wasn't moving.  There was a single white light with orange around it.  Not nearly as bright as the other.  The first passed the second one and then stopped flying midair and became less bright.   The smaller one then got brighter and started flying back up.  They both eventually disappeared into mid air. I was so dumbfounded that I was only able to get a couple of pictures.   They are from a distance and only seem like small bright blurry things in the sky.  But I believe I saw two UFOs.   I also saw a plane fly towards where one object disappeared a few minutes later there were lots of lights in the sky, but I can't tell if it was lightning but there were lots of lights in the same spot back to back.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
