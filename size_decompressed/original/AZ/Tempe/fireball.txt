A fireball spotted in southern Arizona 6/23/09 at about 8 pm;2009-06-23 20:00:00;2 sec;A fireball spotted in southern Arizona 6/23/09 at about 8 pm We are in Tempe  On the night of 6/23/09, my family and I just arrived home back from the grocery store around 8 pm or so.  I looked southeast and noticed what appeared to be a shooting start only a whole lot bigger.  It looked like a huge ball of fire with a tale.  We were facing south and the ball was going downward in the east direction.  I lost site of the ball as it went further down pass the brick wall in the parking lot of my apartments.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Fireballs turn into jelly-saucers;2012-02-04 23:15:00;3-5 minutes;Fireballs turn into jelly-saucers I was backing out of my driveway with my girlfriend and sister in the car when we noticed what appeared to be a fireball directly to the west, about halfway between the horizon and looking straight up.  We immediately pulled back into the driveway and got out of the car (which I left running). The object continued to ascend higher and higher into the atmosphere while a second object appeared slightly closer to the horizon compared to where the first object initially appeared.  A few seconds later the first object disappeared leaving the second object headed east.  Then what appeared to be a third object (or the return of the first) tailed the second object. At this point the two objects lost their firey appearance. They could still be seen on their easternly trajectory but now as soft, white objects with no illumination.  They almost had the appearance of white party balloons but they moved like jellyfish. They appeared to be spinning, but not in a perfect circle, a very wobbly circle. We watched them until they passed us to the north and disappeared over the horizon to the east. We actually saw a very similar object moving the opposite direction (west from east) over our house just a weeks ago, but did not report it.  We live very close to Sky Harbor and are quite familiar with standard aircraft.   I am a musician and videographer, my girlfriend is a painter and graphic artist, and my sister is a recent graduate of U of A.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

((anonymous report));2016-08-30 21:40:00;5-10 minutes;At around 9:40 pm, went outside and saw two bright orange fireballs side by side, heading towards south mountain.  within about 5 minutes, they both faded out and disappeared.  went back outside 5 minutes later and there were two more identical fire balls heading in same direction and as the first two watched one disappear and then the other within 5-10 minutes.  at one point the first set appeared to get real close together and then separated.  the second set of lights seem to be real bright, then dim out and then got bright again before disappearing.  as we live near the airport i have seen many planes which this was not.  again just at 10:18 two more headed same direction, same color and circular in shape.  seemed to be further away this time or closer to the mountain.  oddly they keep appearing within 5-10 minutes apart and in pairs of two.
