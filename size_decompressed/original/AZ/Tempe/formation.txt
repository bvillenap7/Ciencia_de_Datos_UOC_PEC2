Th;1997-03-13 20:30:00;5 minutes;Summary : I was in tempe with a bunch of my friends when we saw a group of about 5-7 lights in the sky. They seemed to stay in the same place. This was that recent Arizona sighting. But I don't get why no one mentions the stuff the planes were shooting in the air. They looked like missles, but they didnt go in one direction. They would descend, go left, bo right, go back up, go down again, and disappear. To me what I thought it was, was the military testing missles. I got seven friends who all saw the same thing. The lights then flew south and disappeared. I submit this so late because I thought it had to be just airplanes because the whole city must have seen it. I was suprised to see this phen The same thing as up above. All observers are college students at Arizona State;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

Formation of about 8 to 10 dim reddish lights.;2015-08-01 20:22:00;~4 minutes;Formation of about 8 to 10 dim reddish lights. Traveling northbound on the 101, I spotted about 8 to10 dim red lights fly slowly overhead in a wide delta formation.  The lights were small and spaced far apart traveling in an west to east direction over the US 60 interchange in between Tempe and Mesa, Arizona.   The majority of the lights faded from view by the time my vehicle passed underneath, leaving only two lights visible from my vantage point.  Very reminiscent of the Phoenix lights back in 1997.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
4 lights in formation over Tempe appear while driving;2019-10-02 20:00:00;3 minutes;4 lights in formation over Tempe appear while driving At about 8PM on Wednesday October 2nd, I was driving westbound on Elliot rd passing Dobson. I noticed a formation of 3 white lights equal distance apart.  At first it seemed as they might have been planes but they were just too close to each other.  Then I thought maybe flares,  but they didnâ€™t seem to appear to be moving.  Approaching the 101, I noticed a 4th light appear to the left side.  As I turned northbound on the 101, I looked back to take one more look, but they seemed to be gone. . . I couldnt find them in the sky. Took video evidence of the sighting.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
