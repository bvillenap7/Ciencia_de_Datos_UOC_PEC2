The form changed from what would appear to be an oval or sphere into something resembling at times a cross.  The object also changed luminescence, at times opaque and bright then dark, almost invisible. At the time it did not appear to be a correlation between the shape changes and the changes in luminescence.  The speed appeared constant, meaning not accelerating or deccelerating, however the shape changes may have effected this. Another important note however is that there was no audible noise.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

It appeared to reflect light from a metalic surface.  Attempts to view it closer with binoculars made it appear to be two spheres joined together.  We photographed and video taped the object(s).  As clouds passed in front of it it remained luminous but held it's position.  It appeared for approx 1 hour, and we became bored with it and went about our day, but kept checking for it. Clouds became more dense and it was obscured.  Witnesses were myself, my husband, and our 2 sons ages 11 & 12.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Dark silent oval craft that was silhoutted against the white clouds lit by the full moon over Tempe AZ.;2013-11-17 03:00:00;12 minutes;A dark silent oval craft that was silhoutted against the white clouds lit by the full moon over Tempe AZ. A friend and I were up late listening to some music when I went outside to get some air and look at the full moon and I noticed a lit up reddish object traveling east to west slowly at about 10,000 ft which kind of looked like an airplane but at a certain area of the northwestern sky it passed in front of some white clouds that were illuminated by the full moon.   As it started to move in a southwesterly direction I noticed that the craft became completely dark and was only a dark oval silhouette against the white clouds and was not making any sounds at all. It continued on a southwesterly path and then kind of just vanished as it got in front of the moon.  And that was all.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

Later in the morning I awoken to a sound in my bedroom like a strange ,,  it alerted my dog and age wined and that was odd for her to make that sound unless someone is in the room ..  Also a rustling sound on papers And a sound outside the window but nobody was there.  I awoken feeling exhausted, headache migraine, hearing strange drumming vibratory tones in my ear.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
orange light traveling east then slows, turns north and stops. 20 seconds later fades out;2020-12-31 21:00:00;40 seconds;orange light traveling east then slows, turns north and stops. 20 seconds later fades out On December 31st at about 21:00 hours I just finished dinner and walked outside and sat down on the patio. I noticed two aircraft flying in the southern sky from the west to east, one larger, higher up and further out and one smaller closer and lower in altitude. Then out of the corner of my eye I saw another aircraft flying the same path in the space between the two other aircraft but behind. The speed of it did not seem out of the ordinary. This one got my attention. I got up and walked out away from the patio and watched it. What caught my attention was it was orange with no other blinking lights as general aircraft would have. I was trying to see other lights on it and its altitude verses the other aircraft traveling the same path. My initial thought was it was higher than both. Then I saw it slow and seemed to turn north but then stop. I thought only a helicopter can do that but its too high and no other lights can be seen on the aircraft. Now I am wishing I had my camera. It stayed in that position for about 15 to 20 seconds then just faded out. My thoughts where it left the sky in a southern path directly in opposite line with my sight of it. I have seen over the yearâ€™s flairs dropped during military exercised in the very distance and I have seen missiles launched also. This was neither. I stood and watched for about 10 minutes the area where the light faded out to see anything and nothing appeared, it was gone. During the entire time of this sighting, I witnessed no sound from the aircraft. I am only making this report because of these facts, I have never seen anything like this in my 58 years. We live south east of Sky Harbor Airport and have seen large jets to small aircraft in our southern skies for 35 years. The sky was clear, and this object traveled in a horizontal path with no discernable arch.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
