Moving White DOT near Phoenix Sky Harbor Int. Airport;2002-03-07 07:40:00;45 to 60 second;Moving White DOT near Phoenix Sky Harbor Int. Airport I was taking a quick Smoke break at work near 48th St. and Southern Ave. just a couple of miles South East of Phoenix SKY HARBOR Int Airport. There was a Cloud Bank, just North and West of the Airport, highlighted by the morning Sun in Dark and White Clouds. I could easily see Jets taking off from the Airport and was able to judge this object as just a few miles further North. The best way to describe this is: A SMALL WHITE, but nonreflecting DOT. Moving East to West. I caught it as it went in front (towards me) of a Cloud that was Dark. It was moving at a pretty good rate, but I know that even if it was a small plane like a Piper or Cessna, or a Traffic Reporting Plane, I would be able to make out more than a small WHITE DOT. (Kind of like WHITE OUT before it dries and has a Shine to it). It went into the Cloud Bank, and though on it's visible trajectery, it should have reappeared in the Break between the Clouds, it did not. I have lived and worked within a few miles of Sky Harbor Int. Airport for nearly 18 yrs. And this was the stangest thing I've seen.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Bright circular light travels quickly and silently from NW to SE becomes brighter turns oval shapped zigzags abruptly and disappears.;2009-09-26 19:18:00;1 Minute;Bright circular light travels quickly and silently from NW to SE becomes brighter turns oval shapped zigzags abruptly and disappears. I was standing outside at 7:18 pm and the sky had been dark for just under an hour by that time. I had been relaxing and just watching the sky. I noticed a bright circular light coming from the North-West area as I was able to view it as it peaked over my house off in the distance. Normally I see air traffic (lots of airplanes) coming in from the north but this one was coming from a different area and look nothing like the other lights. This light was about 3 times brighter and bigger than the planes I usually see and not once did it blink. At first it was really bright but then it dimmed a bit. I thought I was looking at a plane at first but then as it dimmed it looked as if it were really high and I began to think it was a satellite. Almost immediately after that thought the light became very bright and was bigger than when I first spotted it. I immediately called my wife outside to see it as to see if maybe she could make out what it is. When my wife came! outside the circular light was just about overhead roughly 85 degrees above the horizon line. The object was very close and bright but made no sound as it traveled quickly through the sky. It took about 1 minute to go from when I spotted it peaking out from behind my house off in the NW distance to far off in the South East. When the light was far in the South East area my wife and I noticed the light became much brighter and a bit bigger than before, taking on more of an oval shape. The light then slightly dimmed made a zigzag pattern and disappeared at the end of its pattern, ending right where it would have been the line of travel had it not zigzagged. We don’t know if it went up or just simply disappeared. Up until just before the object made the zigzag movement it had traveled in a direct straight line from the NW area to the SE area, once again with no sound and at a high rate of speed.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Orange, glowing, floating circular object over Tempe.;2010-01-15 19:30:00;5 minutes;Orange, glowing, floating circular object over Tempe. From our balcony located at Apache and Terrace Ave in Tempe Arizona looking East my daughter and I saw an object floating upwards, looked like several circular and pulsating forms, glowing orange. Reminded me of a cluster of balloons - my daughter thought it looked like a jellyfish - it definitely pulsated and glowed as bright as the stars in our view.  It originated at about the same level as where the jets fly in over our apartment.  The airport is about 10 miles from here.  It continued to glow and pulsate at a constant rate and finally left our view in a South-Eastern direction until it was out of our sight. Unfortunately, the only camera I have is my cell phone and I was unable to capture it on film.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Very fast moving red and blue orv over Mesa, AZ;2012-03-16 21:20:00;2 minutes;Very fast moving red and blue orv over Mesa, AZ Witnessed a blue and red blinking craft moving west from Mesa toward Tempe possibly over the Reservation.  Craft moved normally and then went into a diving and rising pattern, very much against the laws of physics as I know them.  Slowly continued until it finally dipped below the horizon.  Two or three ordinary aircraft gave chase. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

Green/White Orb in the East Valley.;2017-03-23 19:30:00;5 seconds;Green/White Orb in the East Valley 2 of my friends and I were heading east down Baseline Rd. in two separate cars, about a mile in distance apart.  While one of my friends insists it appeared white, I beileved it to be green, a craft heading in a small arc coming towards the ground in the east valley.  I could only make it out to be a small circle, for I was not close enough to decide the shape.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Rose pinkish orbs in Tempe, Arizona.;2017-05-10 21:00:00;5 minutes;Rose pinkish orbs in Tempe, Arizona. I have a view to flight path of Sky Harbor airport and often watch incoming planes from my upper deck.  On this day, I noticed a rose/pink colored orb in the area where planes are normally in a holding pattern.  I watched it head south in my direction, then made an ubrupt turn to east (opposite direction from airport) and watched until it disappeared.  I then looked back to where I originally saw this, and saw two more coming!   I ran downstairs to get binoculars and by the time I got back upstairs, those two orbs went into same pattern/direction as the previous one.  Then, again, two more come into view - from the same direction and eventually disappeared into the eastern sky.  I did manage to get a picture.  I didn't know what to make of it, but what I find most interesting that no planes landed or were in holding during this time.  Once the orbs were gone, planes were again in view and started landing.  Very strange.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

Multi-colored, roundish, very bright light moving extremely fast across the night sky in more than one direction.;2020-05-14 01:59:00;1.5 seconds;Multi-colored, roundish, very bright light moving extremely fast across the night sky in more than one direction. At approximately 2:00 AM MST, in Tempe, AZ, I was in my back yard looking in the eastern sky.  While observing the moon an extremely bright multi-colored object descended rapidly at about a 10 o’clock position from the moon.  It appeared to change speed, briefly slowing then fading in brightness for about a millisecond.  The object then became very bright again slightly changing direction disappearing rapidly over the horizon. The object was visible for approximately 1.5 seconds .;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
