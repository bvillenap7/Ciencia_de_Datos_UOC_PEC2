Nothing WE have, could have done what we all saw that night.;1997-03-13 20:30:00;20 min;Nothing WE have, could have done what we all saw that night. I was a witness of the famous Phoenix lights mass sighting back on the eve of March 13th 1997. This event changed everything for me...  Later that year my wife left with the kids, followd by a nasty divorce.  I tried to forget what I know I saw...  for 10 years I made it, working nightly in the same outdoor welding shop that I was working in, on THAT night. The guy on the radio starts talking about the upcoming 10 anniversary of the Phx Lights mass sighting, and it was like a switch in my head came on.  I was instantly awakened...  no longer can I hold back on what I saw, and it has become an obsession.  I then reported my story on any ufo website that had the ability.  That's been a few years now and I have yet to be interviewed on what I saw. The vision of the massive yet elegant airshow that was displayed to those who were watching that night, will continue to play on my head like no other memory I can think of.  As I watched it silently make a banked turn as it glided gracefully at the same elevation (or below) as the South Mtn range that it was effortlessly floating along as it flew away from me.  When I first saw it, it was floating over the S.East end if the airport area, and it was in a semicircle pattern about 5 miles wide.  Each of the orbs that made up the outline could move individually (and a few did).  The light of each orange/red orb came from within and didn't radiate out (like molten metal).  The orbs started moving and formed into a V shape with one side lopsided by on or 2 orbs.  when it pivoted to start moving the orb in the middle became the nose of the now V craft and when it pointed as if it were going to come my way...  I panicked and turned to run...  I then realized that this thing my be 9 miles away from me.  I turned back around and instantly my fear was gone and as I watched it for the next 15 minutes, I tried not to blink, as I didn't want to miss a second of it.  I then told a few people and mentioned it to my wife, and it lay dormant in my head until t! he hype of the 10 year anniverssary of it brought it all back. The flare explaination is insulting to my intelligence...  I've lived here in the Phx valley all my 52 years and have seen my share of flare drops...  Not even close.  We have nothing on this earth (maybe inside it or interdimentionally) that could put on a show like we saw in Phx that night.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Observed a slow moving,  vibrant red light that eventually turned 90 degrees, began blinking and then accelerated before disappearing.;2001-01-06 20:30:00;15;Observed a slow moving,  vibrant red light that eventually turned 90 degrees, began blinking and then accelerated before disappearing. My wife and I observed a brilliant red light suspended in the sky.  To the unaided eye, it seemed motionless but with binoculars it was moving in relationship to the stars.  We first noticed it just under Orion's Belt heading towards Gemini.  With binoculars, it was a vibrant red light with no distinguishable features just a beautiful red.  It was as bright as Jupiter.  As it passed between Castor and Pollax, it then turned 90 degrees to the East, began blinking, accelerated and then vanished.  I was observing it as it vanished and I'm certain that it didn't disappear into a cloud bank or anything since I could still see stars.  It was a single point of light no other lights were present.  I am an amateur astronomer and have witness many things in the Heavens, but this was the strangest event so far in my life.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Star-like light visible with the sun risen;2001-12-03 08:00:00;40 min;Star-like light visible with the sun risen This may be pretty weak, but as the sun started rising this morning I saw what looked like a bright star, about 2 degrees below the moon.  What was unusual, was that the sun was rising, and there were no other stars out.  I was driving to work a distance of 20 miles, and throughout that drive the star was still visible.  Even now, with the sun entirely risen and sun beating down on the ground, the dot, though very faint is still visible.  The position of the dot stayed constant relative to the moon which leads me to believe it was very far away.   It is possibly a satelite in synchronous orbit or a planet?... but I've never noticed such a thing before, and certainly not with the sky so bright.  It did not make any movement while I was watching it. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at a celestial body.  PD));33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Bright ball of light seen hovering over Phoenix.;2004-04-06 22:15:00;20 mins;Bright ball of light seen hovering over Phoenix. I was walking west down my street...looking towards Phx and noticing a jet leaving Sky Harbor Intl...not on normal course but flying a bit south and then west.  Then I notice a bright yellow/white ball of light...at first I thought it was just a planet.  But it appeared too bright.  I carry a small pair of 10x25 binoculars with me at all times when I take walks...just for this kind of thing....I focus into it closer...it had no blinking lights...just a yellow/white ball with edges that made it look like Saturn on a tilt.  It was moving slowly Northwesterly over Phoenix.  The trees were getting in my way and I run further north to see it getting dimmer.  At some points it would almost fade out then get brighter...and as it would dim it would change from a reddish glow to a blue/green glow then back up to full yellow/white.  I watched for approx 20 mins til it slowly moved out of view.  It was not a helicopter, blimp or plane!!  I walked home as fast as I could to make this report;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Two objects near the moon hover move and disappear.;2004-05-28 16:30:00;15 minutes;Two objects near the moon hover move and disappear. Taking my afternoon walk, looked up at the moon and noticed a very bright light just to the left of the moon which was at 1/2 moon phase, and up about 30 to 45 degrees up from the horizon. I was wearing prescription polarized sunglasses and after looking for a few seconds made out a smaller much more dim silver spot next to the bright light. Then the small silver one disappeared and the bright light began moving north or to the left of the moon. it moved appx. 3 feet at arms lenght at steady slow speed then stopped, stayed ffor about 10 minutes and disappeared.. There was air traffic at high altitude I would guess 35,000 feet east to west not near the objects but allowed me to guess these were near the top of the atmosphere, well above any air traffic.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
bright light in eastern sky above treeline (Venus??);2004-08-03 03:33:00;more than 30 minutes;bright light in eastern sky above treeline Early this morning (3:33 exactly) I witnessed a very bright light in the sky. I was looking out of a window in our house which looks out onto the eastern/south-eastern portion of sky, because I had noticed an unusually bright light in the sky through the blinds. My first thought was that it was an airplane heading in our direction, as we do experience airplanes and helicopters flying over and over this section of sky on a frequent basis, but this light did not seem to move from it's position at all. I would say it was similar to seeing Venus at it's brightest from our home in Colorado recently, only in the East, instead of the West, and much brighter and definitely bigger. It was just above the line of trees which grow a couple of houses away. I know the exact time, because I was awakened out of a peaceful sleep by a very loud, sudden impact noise (like the sound of a stomp on the roof, or a big door slamming closed) and immediately heard a low-flying airplane approaching, it zoomed directly past our southern facing bedroom window, low enough that I could see it's lights, going from the west to the east. I looked at the clock and it read 3:33. this is when I went into the ajoining room, sat down in a chair at our computer, and witnessed the light through the window. I was up for little more than a half-hour, all the while keeping a loose eye on this light, which in all this time, never moved from it's position. Just before going back to bed, I looked out of the eastern-facing window once more, and noticed for the first time that the light was flashing, or twinkling somewhat like a star would do, but this object was much larger than any star I've ever seen in the sky! In fact, I have never seen anything like this before at all. Around 4:00 I retucked the kids into bed, and went to my own bedroom. Out of curiosity, before lying down myself, I looked out the southern-facing window of our bedroom, to see if I could spot this light, and I just barely could. It was as bright as ever, and still seemed to be in the same position. I have no clue as to how long it had been there before I saw it, or how long it stayed after I went to bed, but I did not sleep well after that. This morning, it was all I could think about, so I immediately got online, and have searched for a couple hours for anything showing the star/planet configuration for last night and today, with no luck. finally I decided to come here, and see if anyone else has reported seeing anything similar. I am sure others must have seen the same object. Perhaps it was something easily explained. My ear will be glued to Coast to Coast tonight, though, in the hopes of hearing someone else's report. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object the witnesses were looking may have been Venus.  PD));33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

Two nights in a row, saw the exact same thing.  Driving home on I-10 around 6:00 pm noticed a bright light in the sky that was hovering and then jetted away at a VERY high rate of speed to the south and up and then disappeared.

It sped up, changed into 2 smaller red lights, then vanished. I thought it was a planet because it looked too large to be a star.  However, it was moving very slowly to the NNE.  Initially it was white but as it got farther away it changed to 2 very small, close together red lights.  Shortly after changing, it was gone it didn’t fade out of sight, it just disappeared.  Total time elapsed:  approximately 2 minutes.  It was close to 8:30pm.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
Three star-looking crafts flying in random directions in the middle of the day.;2009-06-02 13:00:00;15 min+;Three star-looking crafts flying in random directions in the middle of the day. I was looking at the clouds when an luminestent craft that from where I was looked like a star (this was the middle of the day) appeared. It flew straight for awhile then stopped for a couple of minutes. Then it proceeded to fly in random directions (up, diagnally, straight). Another one of these crafts popped out of nowhere for awhile. The first object hovered out of my sight but then a 3rd one of these appeared and just sat in the sky for awhile. I watched for a good 20 minutes but then left so these things could have been there for awhile.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

Lights over North Tempe.;2015-07-25 18:40:00;5 minutes;Lights over North Tempe My best guess is a drone.  Three steady red lights and a blinking green with an erratic flight path.

Ten points of light flying formation in the sky over Tempe, AZ, 21:21 hrs 1 AUG 2015.;2015-08-01 21:21:00;10 minutes;Ten points of light flying formation in the sky over Tempe, AZ, 21:21 hrs 1 AUG 2015 We turned onto Country Club Way in Tempe, AZ, going south from Balboa, looked up, and saw an irregular formation of 10 red lights in the sky moving east.  We got an iPhone photo that caught 4 or 5 (one dot is questionable) of them.  The others had gone beyond our field of view before we could get a photo.   While their formation wasn't a regular shape, like our military pilots fly, they were moving in sync with each other.  They were small red dots, but not blinking like an aircraft's lights.  We followed as best we could, but within ten minutes, we could no longer see any.   Because Country Club Way is a residential street, we could see them much better than people driving on a main street, because of relatively less light pollution.   One of us is a retired Army Intelligence Officer, with service at NASA on the Apollo Program, and a lot of other aerospace industry experience, and a graduate (masters) engineer.  The other witness isn't trained in engineering, ! but reports the identical situation. ((CORRECTION FROM READER)) Hi, Report on 8-1-2015, time 21:21, Tempe.

Three orange/amber orbs silently floating above Tempe neighborhood around Baseline and Kyrene;2016-11-04 01:00:00;90 seconds;Three orange/amber orbs silently floating above Tempe neighborhood around Baseline and Kyrene. On November 4th, right about 1 a.m., I walked outside to smoke and immediately saw these three amber orbs coming in my direction from the north-northeast.  They were eerily silent and must have been about 100 feet off the ground.  They felt quite close.  One of the orbs was a lot more independent and was away from the other two it jerkily, but yet subtly (if that makes sense), zig-zagged up and down.  The other two were constantly side by side and floated in a smooth manner. They must have changed direction when I was desperately trying to get my phone camera out (I managed to get a decent video) and began going west down my street until the lights disappeared from my view.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

UFO Sighting in Phoenix Metro area in the vicinity of Sky Harbor International Airport;2020-10-04 22:15:00;6 minutes;UFO Sighting in Phoenix Metro area in the vicinity of Sky Harbor International Airport At approximately 10:15pm Arizona time, I was driving westbound on Curry Road in north Tempe, Arizona.  Curry road almost directy runs into Sky Harbor International Airport before curving around and becoming Washington Street which runs into Phoenix.  As I was driving, my girlfriend in the passenger seat said, Hey what is that? and pointed at 6 glowing lights that were orange/amber in color that looked like inbound aircraft.  Except instead of moving in for what looked like an approach to land, they simply hovered in a pattern. I couldn't determine if they were directly over the airport, due to the fact I was still several miles east of Sky Harbor, or if they were beyond the airport itself. I thought they might have been signal flares, since there is a large Air Force base in the west valley, but it seemed highly unusual that would happen.  They also did not behave like signal flares as they did not drop in altitutde and maintained their movements in! a pattern together.  As I turned left on Mill Avenue, now going southbound, my girlfriend and I both saw that their lights were disappearing.  It seemed like they were moving northwest and gaining in altitude before the light would disappear.  I crossed the Mill Avenue bridge and turned going westbound onto Rio Salado Parkway to try to keep a visual on them.  I stopped my car and pulled over just before Hardy Drive on the north side of Rio Salado Parkway and saw only one of them left.  From what I could tell it was some kind of aircraft, but it seemed to be traveling eastbound at a high rate of speed, before it would slow down to almost a hover, then would speed along some more.  Then it seemed to abruptly change directions and head northwest gaining altitude before the light completely disappeared from view.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969
