I awoke at 12:14 am on the 3rd of August 2001. I found myself walking to our third story balcony and saw a cigar shaped object about the size of my thumb at arm's length. I saw it at a 75 degree angle off the horizon toward the East. It was a clear night with a few clouds and a bright moon. No sound came from it as it drifted east. I thought it was a blimp as I watch the light pattern flick on and off... However, I saw the shape seem to shrink and wondered at this until I realized it was moving east away from me. It moved or shrank very quickly and then suddenly began a southern line of flight again within 2 or 3 seconds. I watched it move south until tress blocked my view. I can't say I saw a surface-but it did block the stars. In addition, the movement away from me was quick enough to cause grave doubt in my blimp theory.;33.4024599388378;-111.923322629969

It zig-zagged all throughout the sky and then zoomed off into the distance.   No space craft that I have ever seen is capable of doing the maneuvers that I witnessed.
