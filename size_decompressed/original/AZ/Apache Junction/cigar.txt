Object not seen by the naked eye, but captured by digital camera.  ((NUFORC Note:  Bird in flight.  PD));2008-01-21 13:00:00;immediate;Object not seen by the naked eye, but captured by digital camera. This picture was taken by my parents last week (Jan. 21st) about 20 minutes outside of Phoenix, AZ, past Apache Junction. They were taking a picture of the mountains and didn’t see anything with the naked eye. Once they downloaded the pictures to their pc and were viewing them, that’s when they noticed the strange object in the sky just right of center. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  Almost certainly, the blurry object is a bird in flight.  PD));33.39835;-111.5213
