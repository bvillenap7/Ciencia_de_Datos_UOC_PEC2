I looked and looked and saw what I thought was part of the moon with a red light underneath. (like when the sun goes down in the west and there is a red phoenix sky..looked like it does when the sun shines on a mountain.)  I took a double take...then I ran downstairs and went to the front of my home and looked to see if I saw the same thing I did in the window.  It was there!  I went back in to get my daughter and when I came back to show her, it was totally gone! I went immediately to the tv to see if their were any reportings of what I saw.. nothing.  Then waited to get the paper and again went to the tv for the news on this siting...nothing. I can't believe that no one saw this.  It was huge in the sky and just hung there. I have never saw anything like this before...I KNOW what I saw!;33.39835;-111.5213
