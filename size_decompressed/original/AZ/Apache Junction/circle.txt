Two lights appearing one at a time, growing in intensity then disappearing.;2006-02-08 19:30:00;3 minutes;Two lights appearing one at a time, growing in intensity then disappearing. There were two lights that appeared one after another on the eastern skyline.  The first one appeared and flared up rather than instantly appearing.  A few seconds later another light appeared next to it in the same fashion.  They then one after the other disappeared in a similar fashion, with lessening intensity.  The lights were orangish in color and relatively small (though much larger than the standard star in the sky or aircraft lights).  The same exact thing happened 2-3 minutes later but this time it was in the East-Southeast direction rather than directly east. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via the telephone, and he seemed to us to be quite credible.  Please see similar report from Alice, TX, for the evening of February 08, 2006.  We have no way of determining whether there is any relationship between the two sighting reports.  PD));33.39835;-111.5213
UFO looked in danger of crashing at 40K feet.;2014-05-07 22:00:00;1 hour;UFO looked in danger of crashing at 40K feet. To: Peter Davenport, Director On May 7, 2014, at approximately 10 p.m Arizona time, I saw a round ufo with 3 rows of lights of blue, red, green and white.  They were blinking, flashing and started to go off and on.  Then all lights came back on and stayed on until craft left area.  It was hovering over Mesa, AZ, for about 30 minutes, then the ufo looked to be out of control, in trouble because it went from hovering to vibrating, bouncing, shaking and spinning wildly, it would go up and then down slightly, and then it turned 180 degrees on its side and and started spinning wildly.  It would alternate between being top up and on its side, but always appeared to be out of control, it was at about 40K ft in the sky, and was about 20 miles west of Apache Junction.  It stayed in that area of the sky and w/in a range of about 5 degrees for over an hour.   After it was in the erratic stage for about 20 minutes, 3 more ufo's arrived on the scene, 2 were the same size as the one in trouble and the other one was a smaller one, the smaller craft flew up under the troubled ufo and then disappeared inside of it, the smaller ufo remained inside the troubled ufo for about 10 minutes, and never exited the craft.  Then all four ufo's left the visible sky.  Just disappeared. On May 8, 2014, at about 8:30 p.m. a ufo with the same description as the one in trouble on May 7, 2014, was hovering in the same area of the sky, and a second ufo joined it, after about 10 minutes, they both left flying east.  They flew at @ 40 ft and had about 10 miles or so space between the two crafts. My daughter and grandson both saw this activity. They will make their own reports. From: ((name deleted)), observer/reporter ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and she assures us that the report is truthful.  We would welcome other reports, in order to corroborate this sighting report.  PD));33.39835;-111.5213
