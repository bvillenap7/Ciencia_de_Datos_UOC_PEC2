Object appeared metallic in nature.  It could only be seen as it turned, otherwise it was not visible to the naked eye.  Possibly due to sunlight reflecting off craft.  Object appeared thin, with a noticeable triangular shape.  It moved at a high rate of speed, changing directions often.  There were four other people in the vehicle.  I was the driver and the only one who was able to identify it.  No one else saw the object although it was discussed. My background includes a bachelors and master's degree.  I am currently a hospice chaplain and have previously been an elementary school teacher. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Has anyone else noticed the increased military activity in the skies above the east valley, Mesa, AZ.;2014-12-06 12:00:00;5 minutes;Has anyone else noticed the increased military activity in the skies above the east valley, mesa, aj Hasn't anyone noticed the increase of militray aircrafts over east valley and Apache Junction or Gold Canyon?  I have seen so many over the last year.   Today 2 military airplanes going extremely low over by the 88 after the ghost town.  I have seen about 6 military helicopters following the US 60 like a road in formation.   I have seen a whole lot of military helicopters circling the sky out here and planes with missles.  I saw two jets looking like they were chasing eachother and they were low, but they were so fast it was like the speed of light.  They went right over the US 60!  I know I live next close to bases, but I have lives here for 15 years and have never seen such things so frequently.   Any comment?  I'm curious.
