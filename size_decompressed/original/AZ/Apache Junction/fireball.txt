Silent, bobbing flaming orb.;2013-11-26 19:05:00;1.5 minutes;Silent, bobbing flaming orb. On Tuesday, November 26, 2013, at about 7:05 pm, my friend and I witnessed what looked like a flaming orb to the south of East Main St. in Apache Junction, AZ.   It was maybe 1/8 mile away and moving from east to west.   We watched it for about 30–40 seconds before it disappeared behind taller buildings in the area so it might have only been about 100 feet in the air.   It appeared to be orange in color and and flickered as if it were on fire.  The way it seemed to burn was like a marshmallow, a slow lazy flame.   As it moved it seemed to bob up and down as if it were “riding the waves”.  At first, I thought it was a power surge on the power lines but as the power lines switched directions, it continued the same.  There was absolutely no sound related to this!;33.39835;-111.5213

Fireball, with long tail, falling.;2015-01-18 07:25:00;ongoing;Fireball, with long tail, falling. I was just driving home on the US 60, and I noticed something that looked like it was on fire, falling from the sky, and it was leaving a trail behind it.   The trail was really long at the highest it was then as it got closer to the ground it was just a ball falling very slowly.   It's still happening right now looks like it may be over Florence.
