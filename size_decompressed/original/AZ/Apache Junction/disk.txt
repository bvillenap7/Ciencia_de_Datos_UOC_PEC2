08/28/03  Apache Junction,AZ   photo of circular object;2003-08-28 06:10:00;1 minute;08/28/03  Apache Junction,AZ   photo of circular object After taking several photos of the sunrise, I came home and uploaded the photos to my PC.  One photo has a very clear image of an object that is quite enigmatic.  I increased the size by 600% and it still seems to be a solid circular object.  Several other photos of the same part of the sky and taken just seconds apart do not show the object.  I am willing to send the photo to anyone who has the capability to thoroughly examine it.;33.39835;-111.5213
ufos emerge from three small geometric clouds.;2006-12-04 07:00:00;15 min;ufos emerge from three small geometric clouds. at 0700 my wife noticed an odd cloud in the SE sky, maybe 2 mi from our house.  If 2 miles is about right, then I would guess it's altitude to be about 1000 ft, and it's size to be about 100 feet high.  No other clouds were visible anywhere.  The cloud looked flat, was vertically oriented, and had perfectly straight sides, and was diamond shaped.  My first thought was that it was some kind of huge kite.  I  looked at it through a spotting scope, and could tell that it was clearly a cloud.  Then I noticed a round object above the cloud, which my wife could see without the scope, and through the scope it had a frisbee shape, with what looked like a hole in the center. The object looked solid, and had clearly defined edges. It began to move downward, extremely slowly, and changed it's orientation so that it looked almost edge on to our viewpoint, then went behind some low hills just south of the Superstition Mtns.  This took place over maybe 2-3 minutes, and while this was happening, the cloud kind of disentegrated into a more or less normal cloud looking shape, and drifted slightly north of where we first saw it.  At this time my wife had to leave for work, and I went back in the house, where I continued looking at this cloud through the scope.  Then another cloud appeared very suddenly, in about the same place.  It appeared to be more edge on, and looked more like a slash, but I could see that it had the same square edged appearance as the first one.  As I was looking at it, a small round piece of it slowly bulged out of the side, near the bottom, and began the same slow drifting kind of descent the first one did.  Thia one however didn't have a definite shape, it just looked like a small piece of cloud, trailing cloud/steam/smoke/? in a very short tail behind it.  It also finally went out of sight behind the hills in about the same place as the first one, and the cloud disentegrated in about the same manner as the first.  Before this second one disappeared, a third cloud appeared, in jus! t about the same place, with the same thing coming out of it.  I called my wife on her cell phone, (she had just gotten on the 60, headed west), and asked her to look in the rear view mirror if she could and tell me what she saw.  She could clearly see three clouds.;33.39835;-111.5213
White glowing disc flying west to east.;2020-11-24 04:30:00;2 seconds;White glowing disc flying west to east. Single, white, glowing disc. I was staring straight up (12 oclock). Disc materialized at 10 oclock and traveled directly west to east before passing out of sight over my roof (2 oclock). It was the size of my thumbnail at arms length. It is pitch black out with no reflecting light source. I live at 2000ft on the slope of a 5000ft mountain. The peak is less than half a mile away to the east (Superstition mountain). It seemed low enough that I waited for an explosion but none came. I walked thru my house to the east side but there was no sign of the disc. I've never seen anything like it and I look most nights. There was no cloud cover and no clouds in sight. There was no sound.  I am a scientist/physician with 2 doctoral degrees. I have been watching the sky since seeing an UAP about 21 years ago (see report from York PA in oct/nov 1999). This is only my 2nd sighting.;33.39835;-111.5213
