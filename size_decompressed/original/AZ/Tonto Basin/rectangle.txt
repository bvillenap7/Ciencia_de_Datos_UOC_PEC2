My husband and I stopped at the campground, and stopped to look at the water.  There were also people loading their boat at the boat ramp.  The sky was clear, and we observed many stars. As we were looking up at the sky, it changed.  A big black space (about 4 football fields long) covered the stars and was replaced by one rectangular object.  On the left side there was a rectangle with lights in a square shape, and then to the right of it, a row of smaller lights in a horizontal straight line.  The smaller lights looked like the shape of a tic-tac.  We watched this craft for about 4-5 minutes and tried to film it, but my camera only caught blackness.  It disappeared the same way, the sky turned black once again in the space where it was.  We watched for a few more minutes while the stars came back into the spot.;33.8335;-111.2953
