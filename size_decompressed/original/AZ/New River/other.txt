It was a silverish-chromish metal outer part. And had a gold-brown dome on the front. It was shaped as a horseshoe, with pointed ends. The backgrounds were cloudy. I figure it was about 3-5 meters wide and 6-10-meters long. Seen from about half a mile away. There was no sound to it whatsoever. Speed at about 250-500 miles per hour (Only guessing). No trail of smoke or exhaust.;33.9262;-112.0985
