Artificial sounding triangular aircraft circling overhead.;2015-01-18 15:00:00;45 minutes;Artificial sounding triangular aircraft circling overhead New River, Arizona.  Yesterday afternoon I kept hearing what sounded like a small aircraft flying above our house.  It sounded strange, so I went outside to take a look.  What I saw was a triangular craft with a long forward fuselage and what looked like canards at the forward end of the craft.  I would estimate the size to be about that of a Lear jet. I grabbed my camera and snapped several pics before it disappeared in the distance, only to return a few minutes later and I was able to take a few more shots of it before it headed towards a cloud in the distance and vanished. The enlarged the photos to get a better idea of what the craft looked like, and was surprised to see that it had no visible propellors or jet engines.  The strange thing about the sound it made was that it seemed so artificial, like a recording.  The sound also seemed to trail the craft by several hundred feet and the aircraft was not moving any faster than a typical single-engine airplane.;33.9262;-112.0985
