Some friends and I were having dinner in New River next to the freeway and one friend said she had just seen a blimp holding still outside the restaurant a string of lights.  I asked her if she could see an outline or other detail since it was an odd time for a blimp to be flying out in the desert.  She then pointed it out to me and I saw a string of 7-10 or more tiny lights in a straight line.  It appeared to be sitting on top of a mountain to the east.  If it were a building of that size it would be very out of place in the rural desert as the row of lights made it look like a huge building.  I made an effort to look for it in the morning to see if there was a huge house or other structure on the mountain but there was not.  I would have taken a photo but all I had was my crummy phone and it doesn't take good pix at night.;33.9262;-112.0985
