The one top left &quotjoined&quot the one bottom right. Top left one I just saw 2-3 looked like stars, not a plane, in the west sky.  The one top left joined the one bottom right.  Top left one was orange/red, bottom right was white.  Looked like a haze or object in the center, more like a haze Til I ran for my phone to take a picture they were gone  Never saw anything like that in my life I've been seeing the large bright star in the SW when no other are visible but this tonight really shocked me I've never reported anything like this in my life It really was something I've never seen before I think military base to the west but not sure This was NOT a flare I'm still thinking about what I saw!;33.9262;-112.0985
