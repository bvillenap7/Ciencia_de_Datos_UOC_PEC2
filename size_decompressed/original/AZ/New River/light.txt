The Night Life;2007-11-20 20:00:00;20 minutes;The Night Life My friend and I were driving home after a late trip to the store.  I noticed a strange light above the mountains to the east of us.  We stopped and watched the light and noticed several others.  We have video of the lights, there were also several helicopters and jets in the air that night that appeared to by flying towards the lights.  Another light then flew to the west of us, we have very good footage of this light it was very close, but no sound was made.  Later a helicopter flew by in the same direction further away from us and you could clearly hear the sound and make out the description. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous.

Red, green and white bright light seen in New River, AZ night sky.;2014-03-17 22:22:00;4 seconds;Red, green and white bright light seen in New River, AZ night sky. My husband and I were driving north on New River road just south of the intersection with Honda Bow when suddenly we saw a very bright object that had three lights.  It was mostly half red light and half green light with a small white component.   It was headed east (possibly northeast) and about 15 degrees downward for a few seconds.  It seemed like a falling star or crashing aircraft, but then it instantly changed trajectory to completely horizontal for about a second then disappeared, possibly going behind some mountains??;33.9262;-112.0985
5 bright blue lights zig-zagging threw night sky very close to each other.;2015-04-13 20:30:00;3 minutes;5 bright blue lights zig-zagging threw night sky very close to each other. We were driving down road when I noticed what I thought were 5 airplanes flying really close together I told my wife look at that these planes are going to crash into each other , that's when I realized planes don't glow a constant bright blue and they started zig zagging back and forth.   My wife said she was just looking at those same lights and thought it was the little dipper, so we pulled over and watched them with another person that was standing outside their house for a couple of minutes and they eventually flew off in different directions until we could not see them anymore.;33.9262;-112.0985
