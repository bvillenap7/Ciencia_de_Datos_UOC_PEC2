Oval/almond shaped two blue lights dissapered.;2004-12-12 18:32:00;less than a minute;Oval/almond shaped two blue lights dissapered. As I took the garbage dumpster down to the street I saw two blue lights connected by an oval shaped object that just stood out agisnt the clouds. The object dissapered in midair. Not even a minute after it had dissapered a helicopter with a searchlight searched the area where the craft had flown over. This was not a hallicination, I have 20/20 eye sight, and I do not take any drugs that might cause one to halluicinate. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.9262;-112.0985
