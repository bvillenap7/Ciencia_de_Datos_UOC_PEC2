Colorful craft, orbs, strobe beacons in Arivaca;2007-08-07 23:00:00;5 hours;Colorful craft, orbs, strobe beacons in Arivaca I could take you down to Arivaca, AZ and show you many, as many as 10, orbs that hover around the area.  When you are near them, tiny sparkles of light randomly appear like tiny flashes of a camera.  Often there is a strobe beacon in the area of them as well, and they do react to motion and light.  I also see on a regular basis a formation of lights, as well as lower altitude crafts with multiple color effects.  These tend to hover at a higher altitude in horizontal and vertical motion.  Usually to the East but have seen them South and West at times.  These craft preclude heavy orb activity up and down Arivaca road, and I have started seeing more and more orbs lately.  I work out in the desert at night, so I see them from 11pm to 3am.  I know where to find them consistently, and reliably in the same areas.;31.5864;-111.3124

On the 20th we observed three objects enter the atmosphere headed in a northerly direction. We could clearly see thenm  leave the sunlight as they dropped, one flashed when it entered. About 30 min. later we watched two rise out of the atmosphere in a southerly direction and accelerate until no longer visible, about 10 seconds. On a moonless night or when the moon is low, you can sit and watch about 30 degrees from straight up and start observing these objects almost any night you want feel you have a bit of patience. We have watched them change directions, move up and dowm. follow each other, skip off the atmosphere and leave a smoke? trail, etc. We have even witnessed one being chased by two F-16s under full afterburner in a circle around the valley which is about 8-10 miles wide. You want to see UFos just send someone with a camera down around Arivace and look to the skies on a dark night. It is amazing. By the way. The entire area is known for it's wierd ability to drain cell phones that have a full charge in just a few hours or less.;31.5864;-111.3124
