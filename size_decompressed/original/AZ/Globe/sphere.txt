UFO entry with splash March 2, 2011 6:46am MST Globe, Arizona  US 60 East bound        33.418739360628  - 110.816420895193   While traveling through Globe Arizona on US 60 eastbound I observed what appeared to be a bright white condensation vapor trail from a jet airliner at the 11 o’clock position East about 070 degrees true.  The extremely bright object traveling south was creating a vapor trail that was reflecting the sunrise light extremely bright.  This object being viewed for 40 seconds had traveled about 20 percent of the total length of the existing vapor trail. The object made an absolute immediate 90 degree turn east, as I watched the vapor trail also followed the path of the object.  An L shaped vapor trail appeared, and the object disappeared in less than two seconds after the turn. Stopping my vehicle I watched the length of the vapor trail reflect light brightly by the rising sun.  As the vapor trail dispersed it widened.  The area of the newest vapor trail including the L shape dispersed to nothing observable first.  At the same time the beginning of the vapor trail that had looked like regular airliner vapor trail widened to about 10 times the width. Now with the vapor trail quite larger, the beginning of the vapor trail looked like a round splash of paint with 10 or so loops sticking out (image clay pottery suns but the points sticking out were rounded and not the same size)  in the sky, with a perfect circular hole in the middle. The hole size was about 20 percent of the total area and was absent of any visual vapor trail.  The sky could be clearly seen through this hole in the middle.

Saw 3-4 erratic white-yellow spheres moving vertical, horizontal, diagonal, stopping, spiraling at high speed;2011-08-20 19:35:00;90 minutes;saw 3-4 erratic white-yellow spheres moving vertical, horizontal, diagonal, stopping, spiraling at high speed My wife and I were in our backyard spa at 19:35 between Globe and Miami, Arizona, about 1/4 mile north of the intersection of US highway 60 and highway 188. Globe-Miami is about 90 miles east of Phoenix.  We noted an unusual amount of jet traffic in the sky. As we observed the jets, it became apparent that two jets were repeatedly circling and perhaps chasing 3 to four objects situated low in the east sky at an approximate elevation of 20-30 degrees from the horizon.  We assume the jets were military.  The jets were much slower than the objects they were circling.  By compass, we observed the objects between 90-120 degrees east.  We observed these objects for 90 minutes and watched them make extremely erratic maneuvers across the sky at high rates of speed – sudden horizontal to vertical to diagonal reversals and spiraling and stopping across the sky.  The objects appeared to “dance” in the sky.  The maneuvers were beyond the capacity of any aircraft with which we ! are familiar.  We also noted that the normal commercial air traffic to Phoenix in our area seemed to have ceased.  We observed the objects with binoculars of 10x50 and 7x35 powers.  The objects appeared spherical in shape and emanated a white-yellow light.  With the naked eye the spheres seemed about 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a large star.  Three of the objects continued to dance erratically in the sky long after the circling jets departed.  The jets circled the objects for about 30 minutes and left and did not return.;33.4030461538462;-110.788207692308
