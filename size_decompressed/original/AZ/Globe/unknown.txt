Srange light appeared over San Carlos May 23;2017-05-23 19:30:00;30 minutes +;Srange light appeared over San Carlos May 23 I have a rather lousy picture (cell phone).   I was observing the night sky at my cabin on El Capitan pass south of Globe AZ.  The object (light) suddenly appeared and appeared to 'hover'.  The object was pretty far away (possibly over San Carlos, AZ) and at a high altitude (40K ft? approximately the same altitude as jet traffic).  What made it unusual is that the light suddenly appeared and it wandered slightly (was not in a fixed position in the sky).   Occasionally, it would move slightly at seemingly high speeds as if to correct position or as it was having difficulty with a stable hovering position.   It is not unusual for the military to perform exercises over this area.  I do not wish to be contacted, just reporting what I saw.;33.4030461538462;-110.788207692308
