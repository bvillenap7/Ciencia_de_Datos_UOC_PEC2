Egg shaped light spotted, over an hour of time lost?;2002-03-17 00:15:00;2 minutes;Egg shaped light spotted, over an hour of time lost? During a routine return trip from Mesa Az, to Safford Az late Sunday night my wife spotted what she described as an odd light in her rear view mirror.  She said it was too high off the road to be headlights and too low to be an aircraft.  As I was the passenger I took a look behind the van and observed this egg shaped light that wasn't bright like headlights and not glowing either.  The object appeared about a mile behind our van and hovering something like 40' (?) above the roadway. We watched it behind us for what seemed like a couple of minutes.  I cannot report what happend next.  The trip seemed to simply resume and neither of us spoke about the object again.  Upon our return home we noticed the clock - we were about an hour and 15 to 20 minutes later than we should have been - having made the trip many times, we know exactly how long it takes.  We wondered about the object and its relationship to the missing time, but dismissed the entire event and went to bed.  We're reporting this now because we'd like to simply forget that night but you can't forget something you can't remember?  What we do know is that since that evening, when we pass that exact area late on a Sunday night conversation ends and we both get quiet.  Its an odd feeling to sense something happened but the harder you try to remember the more something inside insists you don't???  Anything beyond this right now would be simple speculation.  We've never believed in this stuff, although we've thought that UFO's were likely and had to be something - but this event remains and continues to bother us both.  Wish we could tell you why. ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain of the date.  The witness indicates a date in 1902, which is not his intention, we suspect.  PD));33.4030461538462;-110.788207692308
