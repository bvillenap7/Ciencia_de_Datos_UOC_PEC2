Amber string of lights.;2016-10-25 18:45:00;4 minutes;Amber string of lights. While traveling south on US 60/77 near the old town of McMillanville, roughly 15 miles north of Globe, AZ, we witnessed a string of 5 amber lights in a straight line.  The lead light went out and came back on in the rear.  This continued in succession until they eventually all went out.  When the last one went out, we could see a black object where the light was then all disappeared.  The lights seemed to be 30 feet apart and did not break the straight line formation.;33.4030461538462;-110.788207692308
