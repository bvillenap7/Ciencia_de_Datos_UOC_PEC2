Six objects each consisting of an arc shaped pattern of 7 lights spotted near Globe, AZ.;2013-10-16 21:30:00;25 minutes;Six objects each consisting of an arc shaped pattern of 7 lights spotted near Globe, AZ. On October 16, 2013, I was driving north on Hwy 77 between Winkelman, AZ and Globe, AZ at approximately 9:30 p.m.  I was about 5 miles north of Winkelman when I saw a single light/object drop from the sky and immediately illuminate another 6 lights to form 7 lights in an arc shape.  The object had a center blue light with a pink outer ring and 3 yellow/orange lights on each side of the blue center light.  The blue center light was at the top with three orange lights dropping lower to each side to form an arc shape.  Each individual light had an oval shape resembling the shape of an eye turned vertically.  The lights only stayed on for approximately 3-4 seconds, then went out.  The same light sequence then repeated to the right, and then the left of the original light(s) location. Following this middle, right, left sequence of light appearances, a group of six objects all lit up, each with the same pattern of 7 lights in an arc shape.  The 6 objects seemed to randomly oscillate up and down for about 3-4 seconds, and then disappeared.  About a minute passed, and the 6 objects all lit up again while still oscillating in an up and down motion.  About 15 seconds later, the objects all flew away to the east and over the horizon at extremely high speed, faster than any object/aircraft I have ever seen. I drove about another mile up a hill, and as I came to the crest in the road I was overlooking a valley.  Hovering in the valley ahead of me were the 6 lighted objects at what seemed to be at my eye level (same altitude as the crest of the road, but out in the valley ahead).  The 6 objects seemed to be only a few hundred yards away or maybe about a quarter-mile.  I saw the objects for about 5-6 seconds, and then they all flew away in various directions at the same extremely high speed. At this point the check engine light came on in my vehicle.  A few seconds later, my wife called and when I answered all I heard is a garbled/bubbling sound.  My wife hears the same sound on her end of the phone (I found out later).  This was an unusual sound I have never before heard on a phone.  It was different than the normal static/broken audio of weak cell signal, and I also had full cell service during this time. The above events all happened in about a 5 minute time frame while I was driving along the road at approximately 60 mph. About 30 seconds after the phone call, 2 of the objects reappeared to the east about a mile away and I could see them for the next 15-20 minutes as I drove.  The objects disappeared for the last time when I was about 4 miles outside of Globe, AZ.  I did not see them again after arriving in Globe. The objects each looked to be approximately 50 yards in size, both horizontally and vertically.  However, a thing that was odd about the objects was that all I saw were the lights.  I was close enough to clearly see the lights, but there did not appear to be any structure attached to the lights.  Each “object” seemed to be a group of 7 lights in an arc shape, but had no visible structure between the lights to keep them together.
