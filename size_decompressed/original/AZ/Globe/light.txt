Within a 5 minute span we heard several passes of the familiar sound of military jets (I was born in Globe-Miami area and have lived here 47 years).  We both talked how unusual it was to hear so many military jet passes.  My husband was facing the EAST sky and told me to look.  I saw 2 white-yellow circular lights and 2 objects (white with red lights) in the sky.  The white-yellow circular lights were faster than the other 2 objects in the sky.  It looked like the 2 objects were chasing the circular lights but could not keep up because the circular lights were making erratic moves and were much faster.  One of the circular lights would go right, then make an extreme northern change in direction while the other circular light would go left and disappear and then re-appear.  Then a 3rd and 4th circular light would appear.  Once in a while they would be headed in the same direct! ion and then split off and circle in other directions while the 2 objects (white with red lights) would try and follow them.  At one point, there were 4 white-yellow circular lights and 2 (white objects with red lights).  We continued to occasionally here the military jets (white objects with red lights) over the next 10 minutes and then they disappeared. The next hour we continued to watch 1 to 4  white-yellow circular lights dancing in the sky.  They made impossible erratic movements. A few times the lights would stay in one place, then suddenly race across the sky. The lights would sometimes get larger (as big as a star) with the naked eye, and then change directions and get smaller (1/2 the size of a star).  The UFO’s would occasionally circle instead of making sharp turns.  There was a 5 minute increment that we did not see UFO’s, then they appeared again for another 20 minutes.   By then we were using binoculars and the white-yellow lights appeared more spherical than! circular.;33.4030461538462;-110.788207692308
Bright light moves across the sky and disappeared.;2011-10-05 19:00:00;60 seconds;Bright light moves across the sky and disappeared. I saw a moving light go across the sky I watched it for about sixty seconds until it disappeared.  It was a light brighter than the stars.  It was also slow moving.  But it did not fade away it just disappeared.;33.4030461538462;-110.788207692308
