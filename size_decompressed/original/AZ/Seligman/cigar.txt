Cigar Shaped objects east of Seligman, AZ on I40 East;2004-01-05 17:30:00;10 minutes;Cigar Shaped objects east of Seligman, AZ on I40 East At 17:30 hours on 01/05/04 myself and two others were sitting at a gas station in my car filling up i'd say roughly about 40-50 miles east of Seligman, AZ when I noticed 2 white/gray cigar shaped objects hovering one above the other over the mountain range north of us.  I looked at them briefly and assumed they were weather balloons and turned away.  A split second later my friend screamed at me and said   oh my god, one of them just exploded, to which I turned back and saw that the second cigar shaped object hovering at the lower altitude had turned bright red and began to fall from the sky towards the mountain range.  About half way through the fall object number two disappeared.  After that I saw object number 1 which was also white/gray in color turn a bright red and lower itself in altitude so it was only slightly hovering over the mountain range.  At this point I determined this was neither an airplane or a weather balloon. By this time we were back in the car driving east on the I40.  I then saw object number one fly lateral with the mountain range across an incredible amount of distance at an amazing speed.  I estimate that it moved across 75 degrees of mountain range in roughly 5-10 seconds.  The cigar shaped object appeared to be approximately 1/10-1/20 the diameter of the moon.  It then disappeared when it hit the end of the mountain range and we were all in shock in the car.  We then drove for about 5 more minutes when we looked back at the end of mountain range and saw 6 bright red cigar shaped objects appear in a circular fashion for about 3-5 seconds and then disappear.  We never saw anything after that.  It was an extemely desolate area and I believe we were the only ones on the road.  We took pictures hanging out from the car but I am not sure if they came out.  They are currently being developed.;35.3173;-112.9535
bar shape bright silver no markings moved slowly horizontally and suddenly vanished;2007-09-21 09:00:00;3 minutes;bar shape bright silver no markings moved slowly horizontally and suddenly vanished I happened to look up into a clear blue sky as I stepped outside our house and saw a silver bar shaped object moving slowly from the north east to the south but it made no sound?   I watched it for a few seconds and grabbed my binoculars from inside the house and it was still there, moving horizontally but slowly for a few minutes, (approximately 3) it was about three inches long and about 1 inch thick viewing through my 7x35 glasses.  It had no sound, but seemed like it was a mile 1/2 or so away and may be 1000 ft higher than myself.  We are 5000 ft at our place. Then it just disappeared without moving.  I had a clear view of it, just a silver bar shape with no wings, rotors or tail., or any other markings.  It just instantly vanished in a clear blue sky.   Never saw anything like it, I called the local sheriff department they gave me phone numbers to report it to, they did the same thing, then they gave me a FAA number they did not know where I could call but suggested you on the internet.  So here it is? The sighting was at 9:30 AM on 9/21/07 			;35.3173;-112.9535
