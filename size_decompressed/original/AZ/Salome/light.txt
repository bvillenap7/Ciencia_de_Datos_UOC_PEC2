4 pairs of lights in Sky in path of Helicopter.;2014-01-23 20:50:00;2 minutes;4 pairs of lights in Sky in path of Helicopter I was at Interstate 10 exit 45 in Az. 1/8 mile n/e of the Zip fuel station in the field I saw a Helicopter following hwy 60 eastbound about 5 miles north of my position.  The lights came on directly in front of the helicopter.  It immediately turned south and headed toward the Rest Areas about 6miles east of me I would like to speak to that Pilot.  He Was Much Closer Than I and then 2 nights later I was in Bouse, Az, about 25 miles to the N/W and saw 1 pair of lights in the same area as the previous encountered lights but only for 10 seconds this time I keep going back night after night now with my camera ready but no luck yet You Will Get Exclusive if I Can Capture them;33.7481;-113.5715

2 sets of 3 bright orangish lights in a row above a foothill along the 10 freeway near the CA/AZ border;2020-05-01 20:00:00;1 minute;2 sets of 3 bright orangish lights in a row above a foothill along the 10 freeway near the CA/AZ border May 1, 2020 Driving on the 10 freeway at 8:00ish PM from California to Arizona near mile marker 43 just before the Vicksburg Rd exit 45.  2 sets of 3 large orangish glowing lights in a row side by side above and just beyond the hills directly on the north side of the freeway.  They weren’t high enough to be a plane and they were just sitting there not moving in any direction.  I assumed they were connected to a tower to alert air traffic of the small mountain/foothill.  The height was too high to be a tower but it was pitch dark and I was trying to make sense of it.  As I pointed them out to my sister and cousin in the car, they turned off.  Not all at once but kind of just like powered down quickly.  I waited for them to come on thinking if they were on a tower, they’d be on a timer and they would reappear on and off.  They didn’t.  About 15 seconds after they went out, there was a tiny flash of white light in the darkness where the other lights had been.  Still I was the only one who saw it.  Thankfully, about 15 seconds after that, 3 of the lights came back on and stayed on for a few seconds in which my cousin was able to witness them as well before turning off again for good.  Then another larger white flash of light and then nothing.  We kept looking and nothing again.  We watched behind us until we were too far.  They were gone.  So 2 days later we were driving back home to California and as we came up on that same mountain/foothill, we investigated to make sure there wasn’t a tower there.  There was nothing.  Just desert.  Also, just west of where we saw the lights there is a foothill with towers on it, lots.  But they were far behind us at the time we saw the lights and they are clearly visible whereas the foothill we saw the lights near has nothing on them or on the ground below.  Just don’t want anyone to think we saw the foothill with the towers, it was definitely behind us at the time where these were directly to our left (north).  Maybe someone knows what this was but I’ve made this drive multiple times a year for the past 15 years and I’ve never seen anything like that out in the darkness.  I have no explanation.;33.7481;-113.5715
White light duplicating itself in a pattern;2020-12-21 23:15:00;10 seconds;White light duplicating itself in a pattern While driving east on the I-10 between Quartsite and Salome, after passing the mountains, I looked north and seen a bright light in a fixed position in the sky. It split and an exact duplicate of it moved west of it and immediately stopped. The original light then disappeared. I lowered my window to make sure it wasn't a reflection and at that time, the new positioned light then split up and did the same exact thing, duplicated itself and the prior light disappeared as well. This continued for about 10 seconds and then it completely disappeared. I travel this area often and can confirm it wasn't on a mountain and was in the sky. It appeared to be a mile away but was hard to judge distance. The duplication it made was in a perfect pattern. The only time I noticed movement was when it was duplicating. Otherwise it appeared to be paused in a fixed position. The only thing I can compare this to is the intro of older James Bond movies, where there is a white ligh! t duplicated across the screen. Sort of similar but with more of a pause.;33.7481;-113.5715
