Really bright white light then changed to blues and reds and greens.I went for a ride in my truck and one of them followed me.When I came back I saw 4 more up in the sky.One was faceing north,one faceing south,three in the west.We were watching them all and the south one moved away first.Then the north one.Then the three west ones all left.We heard no sound at all.The sky was very clear.Temp,52* We saw no airplanes moving in the sky for those 2 hours.
