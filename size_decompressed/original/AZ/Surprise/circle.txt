Flash of light out of which two objects diverged;2003-05-19 23:45:00;6 minutes;Flash of light out of which two objects diverged This event is almost the same as the one I reported a year earlier, except that instead of two flashes, there was only one, and the objects in question did not move relative to the backdrop of stars or if they did move, my primitive discernment could not perceive the motion.  A yellow vertical flash appeared in the SW sky at approximately 11:40 PM and since this was the harbinger last year to the same highly atypical event, I fixed my view on this part of the sky.  At exactly 11:45 PM, two objects appeared in this dark space of sky about eight fingers wide at arms length from each other--one slightly higher than the other from my vantage point.  These two reprised the same 'communication' as the last occurrence in that the lower flared twice and dimmed, then the other flared once and dimmed.  This activity went on for about five minutes, then desisted.  Inasmuch as I have harbored an affinity for skywatching, I am quite familiar with the wild twinkling of stars like Sirius, but this was not a persistent twinkle it seemed like an attentive statement/question and sensible response.  After the 'flared conveyance', the two objects remained in a comparitvely dimmed state for another minute after which they disappeared.  Does the earth move fast enough to obscure the view of two lighted objects if they are six finger widths rotated horizontally at arms length from the horizon?  Also, let me add parenthetically that the horizon in this part of the sky is uncontaminated with ambient light.  Approximately fifteen minutes later, I saw the same incident in the WNW sky--same object position relative to the horizon and each other, with the same type of 'flared conveyance'.  After about one minute they too disappeared.  I went out the following night to investigate if what I had seen were stars but owing to the sky's overcast melingering, I went out last night when the sky conferred clarity upon me.  That same space was bereft of anything visible, to me at least. This dark space where the two objects had been two nights prior plyed my vacuous mind with questions for which, obviously, I possessed viciously inadequate answers.  More, even if the two objects were indeed stars whose presence was precluded by some atmospheric variant the last night, why do these illumined objects only appear <i>subsequent</i> to the initiating flash? I am not concluding causation, just an observed corrrelation.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
seen circular objeccts with red,white and blue lights;2005-11-05 22:00:00;1/2hr;seen circular objeccts with red,white and blue lights while camping west of the white tank mounatins saturday night 11/05/05. We observed three (3) circular craft with rotating lights that were red,white,blue. (no kidding) that ran vertical then switched to horizonal this went on for at least a half an hour. we observed these crafts moving horizonal for some distance then they would go straight down and stay there for several minutes then back up to a completely different location in the cloudless night sky. These were no flares! Flares don't asend and move horizonal..They float down and leave a smoke trail..I couldn't deterime a distance for these lights. It could of been several miles away but close enough you could see the lights alternating with the naked eye..when you used binoculars they were really clear and evident that they were circular crafts. Some seem to be bigger or closer than the others. These were not military aircraft from luke air base! we could clearly see those jets and their strobe lights flying around in the night sky. On other occasions I believe we saw flares from Gila Bend gunner range to the south of us..These like some of the others we have saw defy explanation. I havent got pictures or film YET but I deterimed too.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714

Amber colored object makes 90degree turn and disappears.;2015-04-26 20:30:00;3 minutes;Amber colored object makes 90degree turn and disappears. While standing in my front door entryway walkway, I was looking towards the Southern night sky.  Noticed an object that appeared to be much different than the stars and planets.  I continued to watch this object as it traveled true North.  Object was Amber in color.   I immediately entered my home in attempt to get my wife to witness this same object.  As I returned to my previous location, I was able to locate this object in the same vicinity in the sky.   Object had appeared to have taken a 90 degree turn toward the East.   I was fixated on this object as it began to slowly fade away and disappear moments later.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
