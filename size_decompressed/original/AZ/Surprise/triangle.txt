It consisted of three white stars at each tip of a perfectly formed triangle in a star lit sky.;2012-08-07 21:15:00;15:00 minum;It consisted of three white stars at each tip of a perfectly formed triangle in a star lit sky. Triangle Shape in the North Sky of Surprise, AZ  We came from Wisconsin and were staying in Surprise, AZ.   We left a restaurant on Grand Avenue August 7th, 2012 in Surprise around 9:15 PM when we noticed in the north sky a triangle shape star consolation.  We all questioned each other…What is that consolation?  Did you ever see that before?  We stood there for a while and watched it.  It did not move, flash, change color or anything else.  It consisted of three white stars at each tip of a perfectly formed triangle.  The stars/lights seemed to be larger and brighter more so than other stars.  We continued to watch it and then walked to the gas station next door to get some bottled water.  We walked back to the van and took one more look at the triangle in the sky.  It seemed to just hang there and not move.  Dad said let’s go, I wanted to take a picture and he said no, we are going, let’s go.  So, there was no picture taken.   s we left, I felt that I made a big mistake not taking a picture.  When we got back to the hotel, I said that I wanted to go and get a picture of the triangle.  No one else wanted to go along so, I left to go back to the restaurant parking lot.  I drove through a couple of blocks of strip malls back to the exact parking spot we were in about 30 minutes earlier.  The triangle was gone, I stayed there for about 20 minutes hoping for it to reappear, but it did not.  I took some pictures at that time and I captured only one star that looked to be in the spot the triangle was in. I came back to the hotel and shared what I found a felt the need to report what we all had seen.  The triangle was too perfect of a shape it did not look like random stars making the shape.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714

July 4TH to 5th 2013 ufo, 3 triangle shapes moving in triangle formation over nw phoenix metro area.;2013-07-05 00:17:00;~5 minutes;july 4TH to 5th 2013 ufo, 3 triangle shapes moving in triangle formation over nw phoenix metro area. Just after midnight on the 5th day of July 2013, while standing outside with my neighbor, I recieved a call from my husband. He was outside approx one block away with my brother. While outside smoking a cigarette they saw objects in the sky and immediately called me. Immediately after recieving the phone call and while still on the phone, I looked into the northeast sky and saw an orangish red very bright orb.  It moved fluidly and steadily and without sound. Approx 15 seconds after, I saw another of same color and size appear from seemingly nothing and move into a paralelle position to the first object. I hung up my phone and placed it in my pocket.  I turned to my neighbor,  who stood in awe and asked her, What the hell is that? She shook her head and replied, I have no idea…   Another 30 seconds later, a third odject appeared in the same manner as the second and lifted altitude to place its self between and above the other two objects ultimately creating a triangle. The entire event took approx 5 minutes. The three objects moved together in triangle formation until they faded from view. I am a 32 year old female mother of 5.  Currently employed as a chef.  Schooling for medical assistant and working on an aos degree. Husband is 34 yr old male currently employed with Apple. Brother is 24 year old male unemployed and just moved to az the day before the event. Neighbor is 17 year old female and student.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
