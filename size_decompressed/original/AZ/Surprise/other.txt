motionless night time-exposure photo of unexplained object;2003-08-28 19:30:00;?;motionless night time-exposure photo of unexplained object I had set up[ my digital camer to take some photos of a thunderhead, hoping to capture some lighting bolts.  Camera is a Kodak DC-90, and I uas using the next to highest quality setting.  The camera was on a sturdy tripod, and I was taking some short-duration time-exposures.  I saw nothing while taking the photos.  When I later downloaded the photos to my computer and looked them over, one of them had a very strange object slightly above the main cloud.  I am surprised that the object looks to be motionless during this time exposure, and I am also puzzled over the shape and 'lights' on it.  I'm wondering if you could take a look at the photo, and provide some explanation for it?;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
West Valley Lights again!!;2005-10-24 19:16:00;2 minutes;West Valley Lights again!! We were driving on Grand Ave. towards Sun City Grand and once again saw the lights over the West Valley.  There were 2 huge glowing balls over the mountains over off of Interstate 10.  The Tolleson and Avondale area.   Just like a few weeks ago, all of these sightings are at the same time, and there are NO military aircraft in the area!;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
Streak in sky changes direction;2007-10-14 21:25:00;1.5 Seconds;Streak in sky changes direction I was watching the night sky for shooting stars when an object, about 40000 feet in the sky, streaked across the sky from the north and made a sweeping turn to the west. It entered into my view from the edge of the roof of my house. So its appearance was constant, unlike a meteor that generally appears out of nowhere as it enters the earth's atmosphere. This object was within our atmosphere. I did not believe that it was a meteor because meteors generate a straight line as they pass and dissapear. This object changed direction. I was amazed that the speed it was travelling was similar to a meteor. It turned west and dissapeared out of sight. Not sure if anyone else saw this object. The object also generated a small propulsion tail as if it was powered. Maybe someone knows what it was. I find it hard to believe that we have technology to travel at this type of speed. Probably thousands of miles per hour.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714

I saw what I thought was a Cresant moon, then realized it was to small to be the moon.  It was bright Gold, almost like a harvest moon.  Within 30 seconds it started to fade and then vanished.   I am not sure if it was a UFO, but it was very strange, I really think others must have seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Burning plane falls from sky over LAFB in Az.;2016-04-01 20:00:00;30 seconds;Burning plane falls from sky over LAFB in Az. My wife called me out back, when I stepped out my jaw dropped.  There in the sky was what appeared to be a plane falling out of the sky with its wings and body completely on fire.  I yelled for my brother and son and they witnessed it to.  There was no sound just this plane falling on fire.  But lost sight of it as it fell due to neighborhood trees.   I live about 3 miles north of Luke Air Force Base, and it appeared to fall over the base.   Strange tho, never heard a crash and nothing ever reported on the news.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
