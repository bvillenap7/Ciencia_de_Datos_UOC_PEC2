It would change colors from white to green to blue and red as it moved in the sky. We observed this object using reference stars and other stationary objects to verify that it was actually moving until it finally moved out of our veiw leaving the reference star in the same place. This is the first sighting of an unidentified flying object. The object was brought to my attention by my mother , who first spotted it. It was 22:00 on the night of May 3, 2000 and the skies were clear. I began to watch the object move at a fast pace from east to west and then return to its original spot. We used many different reference stars along with stationary objects in our possesion. The colors changed at random. The object stayed at the same altitude until about 22:45. We then noticed it moving out of our sight. I called the local Air Force Base and they stated that they were not flying and that they would send someone out to look at it. I also called a local news station to see if anyone else had reported anything similar. I am a professional in the medical field and a mother of 4. I have never seen anything like this before. I am fasinated with the star and spend a lot of time looking at them and this was not a normal star. If this is a star it will be the first moving star that can change colors.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
A red light that traveled across the sky, then dissapeared.;2000-08-03 21:00:00;10 minutes;A red light that traveled across the sky, then dissapeared. My husband called me outside to see this weird red light. He's an avid sky watcher now that we've moved to Arizona. He had his binoculars and pointed to this red point of light that appeared to be stationary in the northwestern sky. As I looked through the bino's I could tell that whatever it was was very high in altitude and was moving fast, not slow. It was traveling east. As it got directly above us it made a 90 degree turn north, went on for 3 seconds then dissapeared. It stayed red the entire time, no strobe lights, and no pulsations.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714

I have been back in that same area 5 or 6 times since and have saw nothing until last night..Myself and three others were riding our quads behind the mountains in the hysampia river bottom (dry) We were riding and having a ball it was about 10:00PM.some of the guys had to work on Friday so we decided to head back to the trucks and load up..I had told the guys months back about the siteing we had and I got a real oh sure you did crap! We were headed west back toward the trucks as we drove over this little hill where we entered back into the wash. The lead guy Dennis stopped and waited on us. I thought this was funny cause most of the time they never stop for anything.(except beer) When the rest of us got to him he was waving his arms for us to stop to.We all stopped and saw two sets of lights just ahead of us over the wash above some corrals. It was flash back time for me..I told them to turn off their lights and motors.The lights were several thousand feet up I think. There they were again No noise, No nothing, motionless. These lights looked to be the same color as the ones we saw before. It was a full moon out and like daylight. I decided to drive closer with dennis behind me. we drove with the lights off real slow. the other guys waited not wanting to come..We had gone maybe a 1/4 mile when the lights went off. I believe I could see a faint outline of something that just looked black..Kind of in a wedge shape. I could'nt tell if it was one thing or two? All of a sudden the lights came back on this time the ground was lite up under them. why is there no light showing down coming from whatever this is..? like a flash light would do?? We watched this for several minutes then heard the guys quads start up behind us.They were going out the other way and leaving us..Dennis said he didn't want to be another fir! e in the sky guy and said lets get the hell out of here. so we left and headed back around another way to the trucks.. we never saw the lights again.. This is the second time now for me seeing these lights. I have 5 guys who have saw the same things I have saw.No more sure you did now!! I wish someone one would go out there and camp that was braver than me. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON OUT WEST OF PHX???((name deleted));33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
followed 6 lights in a circle shape;2005-10-20 19:00:00;2 hrs.;followed 6 lights in a circle shape My brother, myself and my two nephews were traveling back to Surprise from Wickenburg on Hwy 60 headed east.  When the white tank mountains came into view, we observed three (3) lights (white) that looked like they were on top on the north side of the mountains.  We watched them for at least thirty minutes dimming on and off.  There were no strob lights or the normal plane lights one would see.  When we arrived at my house we observed a large bright white light to the southwest of the white tank mountains.  This one was either much closer or much bigger than the other three that we had been watching.   My neighbors came out and started observing the big light with us.  About that time my wife and daughter,husband and two kids came home.  My daughter went and got my high powered binoculars and spotting scope.  With these we could see is a bigger brighter light. It seemed to have a red glow around it at times.  My brother deceided to drive down sun vally parkway west to give chase to it as it was moving off to the west.  By now an hour had passed.  As he got north of the white tank mountains they could still see they smaller lights above the mountains still stationary.   But now the biggest light was center of the mounatins some three or four hundred feet above the mounatin top headed west.  Sun Valley parkway turns at some point and heads due south, as they were now headed.   They started gaining on the object and could see 6 lights in a circle.  They followed it and watched it head toward the Palo Verde nuclear power plant.  They watch it for another 45 minutes before it finally fadded away.  I believe all air craft are required by law to have (strob lights) these had none..  They were diffently not flares, nor choppers. This is the second time in a year I have seen these lights over or behind or on top of these mountains..whats weird is we watched jets from Luke Air base flying all around but seemed to be oblivious to these lights.  I will be watching this site to see if others report anything? ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE)) Peter Thanks for taking the time out and speaking to me about this incident.. I would like to add I am a Vietnam Combat veteran and have seen every type of flare.  I have shot off hundred's of hand held flare's myself while in Vietnam.  I know what a flare looks like and how it reacts to wind and other climates.. These lights were NOT flares.. Flares do NOT move horizonally at the rate of speed these traveled when they left the area.  I will send you a map and try and get asmuth's for you..  I spoke to the friend in Tonapah, Az, whom I called that also wittness the light but unfortunately he doesnt want to get involved..  But I still have his location..  If you can send me your fax number I will put together a detailed map and fax it to you in the next few days..  I'am going out tonight with my camera and camcorder in hopes it will come back tonight.. My brother who was in the chase vehile will collaborate this story and give us a very good line of site on the map..  He wrote down the highway marker as they sat watching these lights..  He also would not mind speaking to whom ever is interested in listening Thanks again..

More lights west of Phoenix.;2005-10-25 19:30:00;11/2hr;More lights west of Phoenix. This is the third night we have drove behind the white tank mountains and observed these orangish lights south of us toward Interstate 10.. These lights at times stay in the exact same place for over 7 minutes..sometimes there are 4 or 5 lights lined up in a straight row.  I have looked at them thru my 700mm telescope and can see NO smoke trials.  I dont believe these are flares. The local news are reporting these are flares down at the Gila bend gunnery range south of our location. Last night we saw these same orangish lights north of our position toward Wickenburg,Az.. There are no gunnery ranges in that direction nor militay bases of any kind.  At one time we saw two fighters fly around the white tank mountains west of us and headed north from us.   We were watching them with binoculars when we observed this orange flash that appeared right behind them.this was not their counter measures from the air craft.  I dont have any answers but something strange is happening out here west of Phx.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
Immense Light Near Phoenix Northwest Valley;2005-10-29 19:00:00;1min;Immense Light Near Phoenix Northwest Valley I was driving home and noticed a large white/off white ball of light toward the Goodyear/Avondale area.  My first thought was that it was an aircraft because that would be looking toward the Luke AFB vicinity.   But then I noticed plane lights close by to this object and the size difference was immense.  If the plane lights were dime size, this thing was quarter size.   Then while I watched the object hover a source of light shot up from it.  At this point it looked like a shooting star with a tail, but it wasn't moving or falling.   I lost site of it while driving past buildings and did not see it again.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714

Noticing that the clouds appeared to be much brighter than usual,I walked into the yard to look at the Harvest moon.  Unfortunately, that is not the only thing I observed.  Above my house, there were several (over 100), star-like objects extrememly high in the atmosphere. The objects were moving much slower than conventional aircraft. This information is based on observations of comercial crafts in the PHX flight path. The objects were of varying sizes or at different altitudes making their size appear to be ether larger of smaller. The objects did not appear to change their formation. There were several clusters or groups with the balance seameing to be at predetermined distances. The objects moved from the North heading South over Luke airforce then turned sligtly South/East. If their flight path remained consistant they eventually would have overflown Tucson.  Not wanting to be the only one who saw these objects, I ran into the house and woke my roommate.  Together, we observed these objects for over a half hour. I got disheartened when after calling 911 they acted like I was some sort of retardo or drunk... I instructed them to go outside and to take a look for themselves. The  objects movement with relationship to the stars was impossible to miss!  Shortly, therefore, I called Channel 12 Breaking News.  The only question they asked me was did I get any film of them.  No, I said: I don't usually go out for a smoke or at any other time with a video camera in my hand!  Almost immediately after my call to 911 at least two military aircraft were scrambled.  Where as the military always denies these scrambles or flying that late at night . . . you can take it from there.  My roommate and myself are college graduates and our ages are 58 and 60 respectively.  We are both professionals living and working in the Phoenix area. Neither of us drink or use drugs.  We don't need attention . . . we seek answers.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
Three lights tracing peculiar flight patterns across the sky;2007-05-10 21:00:00;11 minutes;Three lights tracing peculiar flight patterns across the sky In short, what was observed: Three nondescript lights proceeding along erratic flight patterns in the low Southwest sky of Arizona. By erratic I mean they were tracing lines back and forth linearly as well as parabolically.  I recently purchased a BMW M3 and, as a matter of driving pleasure, wanted to stretch its legs a bit in an area devoid of traffic hazards. I pointed my car’s compass point directly west along Bell Rd and drove until I converged with 219th avenue, at which time I stopped and played with my satellite radio module.  What captured my attention was a ‘star’ like object that jerked from left to right (south to north, from my vantage point) instantaneously. It covered a distance 8-10 thumb widths at arm’s length and stopped immediately. I cannot articulate the geometry of its flight for the 11 minutes I watched it, though I will say it completed this manuever a few times in addition to sinuous ascents/descents interposed by intervals of no perceptible lateral/superior/inferior movement.  Another ‘star’ like object appeared in the black of the sky accompanied theretofore by no flight trajectory it simply appeared as if it just materialized into the temporal sequence. It too moved linearly quite fast stopping on a dime and remaining in a fixed position for a little while.  Moreover, I perceived splashes of light emanating from this second light to an area both above and below it. These splashes were dimmer in luminosity than the object, by comparison. Then it traced circuitous patterns in a small area of the sky gradually departing behind White Tank Mountain, as did the third object (It is called a mountain but is really a large hill).  I do not know if there are military bases in that direction. Luke Air Force Base is near but in the opposite direction. Yet, even if these objects were borne of man, how could they move in the fashion I observed? The night sky is apt to deceive therefore I make no conclusions and offer only my perceptions of what I saw.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714

What looked like an unusually bright star in between the last 2 stars in the tail of the big dipper that was twice as bright as the other stars stayed fixed and did not move for about 20 seconds. Then it began to slowly move back and forth I thought my eyes were playing games but I judged the realationship between the other stars and this bright object had subtle movment then it smoothly started sliding off to the right and quickly got darker at the same time moving east/northeast then it was dark and I could no longer see it, just 10 minutes earlier I saw a Solid white star blinking off and on every 5 seconds seen in the northwest sky moving left to right,East did not have the normal red and green lights of a normal aircraft, I thought it could have been a satelite rotating reflecting the light of the sun on it's solar panels that had set hours earlier.About 5 to 10 minutes after seeing the object in the big dipper 4 F16's flew out of Luke air force base in the general direction of the object I saw in the big dipper and flew right over my house, they normally do not fly at that time of night and not in loose formation, I live near Luke AFB and have a general idea of thier flights they train pilots and fly in tight formations in gruops of 2 to 4 aircraft.

A bright blue light n the sky and quckly shot accross the sky. 2 witness;2008-07-05 01:00:00;10 seconds;A bright blue light n the sky and quckly shot accross the sky. 2 witness The day after the Fourth of July myself, husband, brother-in-law and sister were sitting around the pool. We had been in the pool all day and after eating dinner we decided to go back outside and enjoy yhe weather. It was about 1 am and we were watching the clouds roll in from the south west over the white tank mountains. It was partly cloudy over our house as well. My sister and I enjoy watching the lightning beacuse being from Arizona it is very rare we get a good rain storm. The lighning we had been wayching was several miles away froms us and there had been no lightning above us at all. We both saw the sky above us light up, at first we thought it was the lightning. My sister and I looked up at the same time and in a small cloud we saw what appeared to be a bright blue light. It was still in the cloud for about 3-4 seconds. Then the light shot acroos the sky to the right and was gone. we looked at each other in disbelief. And asked both of our husbands if they saw it. neither of them had seen the actual light but they did see the brightness from the light that lasted longer than a bolt of lightning. There was no lightning above us at all that night so I am not sure what it was we saw exactlly but it definatly was not a plane or a jet because it made no noise. It was there in one spot and within an instant it was gone.  The development we live in is new and is right behind the White tank mountains.We used to ride out there frequently, until they developed these homes, on our ATV's. This is not the first time we saw something like this and I am sure it won't be the last.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714

They would retreat and move around. Most retreated after about 3 or so minutes but about 5 remained and in a few minutes vanished. They were located in the direction of Scottsdale, AZ. I went inside to get my phone and called my husband who was nearby and told him to look outside. By that time they were retreating. I wish I had taken a picture with my phone.

Large Orb Above White Tank Mountain Range;2010-08-07 19:15:00;3 min;Large Orb Above White Tank Mountain Range I was standing on my back patio which faces west towards the White Tank mountain range and noticed a bright amber orb just above a peak on the mountain range. It was stationary and seemed to brighten quickly at times. I thought it might be a star, it was brighter and bigger than any other star visible in the sky. I went back inside the house for about 20min and returned to the patio to view it again and it was gone. I looked higher in the sky to see if it had changed position like a star (due to earth's rotation), but did not see anything that looked similar in size or brightness.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714

While traveling on the 303 sometime after 8:00pm I spotted five off white lights in the sky, north of the 303 and east of the 60/Grand Avenue interchange.

Note: I have seen the bright white orb in the sky over the White Tank Mountains over a period of 5 years from time to time. The orb was a very bright white at times, to a dull off white and then would just dim out. I thought it was maybe a helicoptor, but the light seems odd.

One small round white light or craft moving through the clear afternoon Suprise, Arizona sky.;2014-05-13 02:30:00;5-7 minutes;One small round white light or craft moving through the clear afternoon Suprise, Arizona sky. At approximately 2:20pm on 5/13/2014 in Surprise, AZ, I was laying on a raft in my pool looking at the sky. The sky was completely clear blue no clouds. I saw one small round white dot or light moving steadily through the sky in a line. It wasn’t moving very fast. It looked like it could have possibly been spinning or moving in small circles at times. It seemed like it was very high up in the sky. Higher then a plane or bird would fly. I asked my husband what it was. It took him a minute to spot it. Neither of us could identify what it was. I’ve never seen anything like it.  I continued to watch it for about 5-7min. It went in a straight line, then seemed to  stop spin in place in small circles then turned and continued moving in a straight line again until I could no longer see it. The object left no trail and made no sound. I noticed someone else had posted something similar to what I saw on 4/3/2014 in Surprise AZ.

String of lights;2021-02-19 04:40:00;4 minutes;I am in the habit of gazing at the night sky now that I am retired. On the 19th February, 2021, around 04:40, I was watching a satellite pass from the northwest to the southeast. I see satellites quite often, being a distance away from the bright city lights of Phoenix. I like to watch for the ISS passing over as well, (it was due to fly over at 05:59), so I do know the difference in speed and altitude. Shortly after the satellite passed into the horizon, came a string of lights unlike anything I have ever seen.  The string of lights looked as if they were the same altitude as the satellite I had been watching. They were moving in the exact same direction and at about the same speed as the first satellite.  Here is the approximate formation and number of the lights: .  … .. . ..  ….  . . . …  .. .. … . . . . …    ….  . . . .. .   ..  . . … . …   … .   .. . ..  .  .     ..   …  .. . .   .  .   . .  . .. . .     .   .   .  .    . . My camera on my phone would not have captured the string of lights as they were too high. There were no aircraft in the area, no clouds and no ground lighting that would have reached that altitude. There was no sound. The string of lights trailed off one by one, but the leading lights continued toward the southeast all in the same straight line as the original satellite.  I would be very interested to know if anyone else saw these lights over the Phoenix area.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
