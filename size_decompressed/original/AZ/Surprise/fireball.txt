Comet like light seen in the western sky near Surprise, Arizona;2005-09-22 19:30:00;3 minutes;Comet like light seen in the western sky near Surprise, Arizona We saw a bright but small light travelling from north to south in the western sky.  There was a light orange trail of light behind the object that did a series of switchbacks going towards the south but staying at the same height.  In front of this meandering was a birght white light that was slowly moving upwards and leaving a trail of light behind it like a comet.  The trail of light exteneded from the switchbacks upwards.  Then the trail of light stopped and the bright light kept moving upwards and it looked like a haze shaped like a cone was behind the light.  Then all at once, it disappeared.  The meandering switchbacks of light stayed in the sky for at least 7 minutes after the bright light disappeared.  We drove west trying to see where the light was coming from and it looked to me like the trail of light started behing the White Tank Mountains.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
ON 10/29/04 AT APROX 18:30 PM MYSELF AND 2 OTHER EYEWITNESSES WERE DRIVING BACK HOME FROM A LOCAL GROCERY STORE AS I LOOKED UP AT THE N;2005-10-29 18:30:00;7 MIN;ON 10/29/04 AT APROX 18:30 PM MYSELF AND 2 OTHER EYEWITNESSES WERE DRIVING BACK HOME FROM A LOCAL GROCERY STORE AS I LOOKED UP AT THE NIGHT SKY AND SAW WHAT SEEMED TO BE AT THE TIME A FALLING STAR AS IT JUST ZOOMED THROUGH THE AIR I WAITED FOR IT'S LIGHT TO DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR BUT IT DIDN'T.  THE LIGHT DID NOT FADE NOR DID IT'S HORIZONTAL LINE STAY STRAIGHT.  IT STARTED TWIRLING AND GOING ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IN THE SKY, I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS FIREWORKS BUT IT COULDN'T OF BEEN BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY BRIGHT THICK LIGHT IN SKY.  IT ALSO CROSSED MY MIND THAT MAYBE IT WAS A JET DOING REGULAR FLIGHT TRAINING SINCE WE LIVE CLOSE TO AN AIRBASE, BUT THAT LIGHT NEVER COULD HAVE BEEN FROM A JET NOR THE THICKNESS OF THE LIGHT. THAT LIGHT WENT WAS MOVING AT AN EXTREMLY QUICK SPEED AND MANUVERED IN A WAY THAT NO JET OR PILOT WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL, THEN THE LIGHT WOULD DISAPPEAR FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS AND RETURN. I THOUGHT MAYBE IT GOT LOST IN THE CLOUDS BUT THEN REMEMBERED THAT THE SKY WAS SO CLEAR THAT THERE WERE NO CLOUDS THAT NIGHT SO HOW COULD THAT LIGHT DISAPPEAR AND THEN POP BACK UP AGAIN. I TOLD THE 2 OTHER OCCUPANTS IN THE CAR TO LOOK AT THE FALLING STAR AND LOOKED AT IT BUT ONCE IT STARTED MOVING IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND AT AN EXTREMLEY FAST SPEED THEY ALSO NEW RIGHT AWAY THAT IT WAS NO STAR, NOR NO PLANE. ONCE WE GOT TO OUR PLACE OF DESTINATION APPROX 5 MIN WE JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR TRIED TO LOOK FOR THE SPEEDY LIGHT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE IT FOR ABOUT ANOTHER 30 SECONDS AND IT DISAPEARED AGAIN BUT THIS TIME FOR GOOD. I NEVER BELIEVED IN UFO'S BUT IT ISN'T UNTIL YOU SEE IT YOURSELF, THAT ONE BELIEVES.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
Falling Star Turns Out To Be Something WAY Different;2011-03-18 19:40:00;4 Minutes;Falling Star Turns Out To Be Something WAY Different Wife and I were driving home and saw what looked to be a shooting star. Not uncommon in AZ but the thing that seemed odd was how long it was going.  The big fire ball with a large flame following it looked to have come from a very high place in space. After we watched it fall for about 45 seconds it then just STOPPED. It sat there and did nothing but glow.  Then it went to the right and started to fall again with the fire like tail behind it.  After it fell some more it then stopped again! This time it just stayed there for what seemed to be a minute or so.  Then just like before it started to fall with the fire tail behind it.  It eventually went down too low by the mountains of what I think is Buckeye or Goodyear City and we lost it.  Called around to the news stations and Luke Air Force Base and no one saw or heard anything about it.  Wife was a little freaked out but I thought it was cool! We are trying to find out what it was.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
