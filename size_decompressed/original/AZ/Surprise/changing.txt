The lights were huge and were spaced out as wide as 3 jumbo jet planes. We saw them come out of no where and left just as they showed up.  No trace, just gone, like a light switch. The second night, in the same place at the same time we saw 4 of the same lights in a perfect diamond shape.  After about 2 minutes the shape formed a perfect square.  As soon as I snapped a pic (if you need it contact me, it is small, and if you know what you are looking at, you can make out the square)  I looked at the phone (it was on a camera phone) it was gone again in a split second  T he final night at the same time, same location I saw one small light for about 3 minutes and it was gone. The first night the media played of as Military flares.  The second night I saw the after burner of the Military planes and that is NOT what we saw those nights.  What we saw all 3 nights sat there, made perfect shapes, not like flares or planes, and were huge.  Then left.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
Object(s) inspecting what appear to be chemtrails.;2012-06-12 10:05:00;12 seconds;Object(s) inspecting what appear to be chemtrails. While video recording some strange jet trails, probably chemtrails, I unknowingly filmed a unknown object, as well. The camera was a Sony CX550V recording in HD, Night Shot (infrared) was OFF, auto focus, and normal optical zoom up to 10X.  I had hurried to get the camera, after steping outside and viewing massive chemtrails, and was a bit disorganized.  The still images are the best I could do, not seeing the object to focus on it.  I was looking to the west when the object(s) appears.  The video and still images can be seen at:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUrIBJZHzqs&feature=plcp;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
