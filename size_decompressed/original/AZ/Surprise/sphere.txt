15+ UFO's in formation.   ((anonymous report));2018-02-20 11:30:00;5-10 minutes;15+ UFO's in formation On Feb. 20, 2018, at approximately 11:27 am, we looked up and saw about 15 to 20 objects in the sky.  The first sighting appeared to be a line shape, such as a bird formation, then it turned into a spherical type of shape.  Objects hovered and danced around each other within that shape for about 6 minutes.  They were reflecting the sun light as if they were made of metal or glass.   At 11:33 we then went from the backyard to the front yard to observe the objects. It took us about 10 seconds to be out front.  When we got there the objects were nowhere to be seen.  We stayed out front and kept looking for about 5 minutes.    Then at 11:38, they appeared again father north of the first sighting.  It appeared that they were going in and out of sight.  They were very bright then disappeared.  This second sighting lasted about 1 minute and 20 seconds. During this sighting the surrounding areas were extremely quiet, no bird sounds, no plane noise, no nothing.  We do live about 10 to 15 minutes from an air force base.
