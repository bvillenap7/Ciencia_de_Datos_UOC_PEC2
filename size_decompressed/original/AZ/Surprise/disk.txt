Camera was pointed North and at an elevation of 60 deg. and had been running for 14 hours. The video compilation shows a plane comming over at 07:43, a few minutes later at 08:08 the UFO very fast from South to North, then in a few minutes at 08:26 a helicopter.   The UFO is reflecting light from under it, so may be higher than the plane and helicopter IMO. After deinterlacing the video output, I recovered 4 frames of the object.   Attached the enhanced four frames to the end of the video. The video may be reviewed at:  http://youtu.be/pbav2gPcc04;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
UFO enters atmosphere, turns into fireball, exits fireball.;2012-08-13 04:49:00;few seconds;UFO enters atmosphere, turns into fireball, exits fireball. UFO burning in over Surprise, AZ. What I thought was a common meteor video turned out to have a UFO surprise!  This was captured on 8/13/2012, at 4:49 AM, on a Yukon Night Ranger digital night vision camera operating in stand alone mode. Recording video feed with UFO Capture software in motion detection mode. Camera was pointed North at an elevation of 60 degrees.  The UFO hit the atmosphere and starts to glow, then turns in to a fireball. Near the end it emerges from the fireball still intact for the most part. The upper part of the UFO may have seperated from the lower section. I am an ex satellite radar operator who worked for the Air Force Satellite Test Center and Kodiak Tracking Station.  Have recorded thousands of video segments, none quite like this one.
