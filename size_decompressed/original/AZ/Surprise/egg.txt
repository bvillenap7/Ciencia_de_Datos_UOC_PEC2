July 3, 2013, at approximately 4:07 AM, motion detection camera recorded an object inside what appears to be a bubble, travelling over Surprise AZ.  Camera was pointed to South South East and set to an elevation of 30 degrees.  Object appears to come from the North heading toward the South West. Object appears to be inside a bubble of some kind.  Even though the object is seen with slightly different shapes the bubble appears to be staying the same basic shape.  Taken with Yukon Digital Night Ranger 5X42 night vision device to video output. Recorded to AVI file with UFOCapture software.  Seven frames were detected.  Still image saved using VirtualDub and imported into Sony PMB for enhancement, then saved using MS Paint.
