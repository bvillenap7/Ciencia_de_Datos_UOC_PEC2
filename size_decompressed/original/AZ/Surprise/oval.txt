Round disk flat bottom with a white aura around it.;2015-03-15 12:00:00;picture;Round disk flat bottom with a white aura around it. I was in the back county taken picture of jeeps coming down a hill. When I enlarge the picture there was a dot in the cloud I enlarge the dot to see it was a large disk in the sky and has a white aura around it and a flat bottom. I would like some one to look at this picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714

Silent star-like craft races through northwest valley;2019-09-21 19:00:00;30 seconds;Silent star-like craft races through northwest valley A bright white light simialr to a star in size and color raced from the northwest to the southeast.  I thought maybe it was a satellite at first, but was too bright and too fast.  Not a shooting star because it had a definite flight pattern and saw it for far too long.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
