Flash in the sky;2002-11-15 18:30:00;5 SECONDS;Flash in the sky On the evening of 11/15/02 we were on our way home when we witnessed a flash in the sky, it almost looked like a flash of lightning. It appeared to be falling from the sky and then like a camera flash it just disappeared. I know others had to have seen it, because there was a road crew working on the road and there was a DPS officer sitting along side of the road with his lights flashing. There was no mention of it on the evening news. I know that it was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen, but it was too big to be a falling star.;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
Flashes of white light in the night sky.;2009-07-04 21:36:00;5 min;Flashes of white light in the night sky. The wife and I were sitting on the back porch. I had caught a flash out of the corner of my eye. So I kept watching the sky and it flashed again. It was a very bright white light like a star but may be even brighter. It was too high for an air craft and it would seem to move form spot to spot in the sky. It would flash ever minute or so. In different spots but not too far apart. And not in a straight line. I’m thinking maybe there were two of them. Because I had saw it flash in the same spot that I had saw it the first time then again in another spot. Like they were signaling each other. I had seen this once before over Lake Pleasant here in AZ. But to nights sitting went on for about five minutes then just vanished. And in the lake experience it had moved so quickly it had left a like vapor tail of light but it was a flash at the same time. I thought it might have been a satellite but it did not keep moving across the sky in a straight line. I thought it might be the space station adjusting its solar panels and they were reflecting off the sun. But it would flash and move its position and then flash again in a different spot. And then again in the spot I had seen it the first time in the sky. The flashes were in 5 to 10 min intervals. It went on for about about an hour or more. This was not a normal pattern for objects of this world. But it was very abnormal in both sightings and I’m positive that they were not of something we have. When I saw it out at the lake it was in the middle of the box of the little dipper region in the sky. This was in June Labor day weekend of 2009. Like I said it was way too high for one of our planes . It appeared to be out in the stars. I just don’t know . I would like to know if anyone has seen this before?;33.6311616071429;-112.372867410714
