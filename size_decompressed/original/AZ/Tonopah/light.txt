I personally did not see any thing. except I remember think, thats an ood lookig cloud formation. I was heading south from Tonopah Az down 95. thought to my self, I will take a few pic's as I am rolling down the highway. All i seen was Blue sky and maybe one ood little cloud. So now wen I up loaded the photos,is when the images showed up. My camrera is a Sony cyber shot3.2 megapixle. except I had the resolution set at 1600x120 . also I have been experiencing some interesting things happening to me since going through that area. the photos I am uploading to you are  under copy right 2004 by Calvin L Zurowski Please note at 200percent enlarge the 2 cwhite objects seem to have some sort of a circle in front of them.I personally belive they came out of that odd cloud. ( seems to have some sort of hygroglifs that I can not make out. if you look close ther are also some light diamond shaped (clouds) around what I refer to as thier entry point. Please be advised that ,I hate stuff on my dash ,I never take pictures When vechicles a close enough to leave a reflection. In closing I have  procted the orignal images on the memory card, for future refrence. I now belive that they most definetly! have Cloaking capibiltys Is this an entry point, from anoter deminsion?;33.4228;-112.9528
Small white, unblinking lights moving silently across sky.;2020-04-13 04:00:00;5 minutes;Small white, unblinking lights moving silently across sky 33.44020°N / 113.038°W, approximately  4/13/20 Went camping with friends at Saddle Mountain near Tonopah, AZ.   Around 4am there were several lights moving across the sky.  Just small, unblinking lights, moving too fast to be satellites. When I became aware of the first one, it was because the light seemed to get brighter for a second then faded back to the original brightness (similar in brightness and seeming distance as that of a far away airplane.   But again, NOT blinking and no sound at all) as it moved across the sky.   It faded and then reappeared in the same spot I first saw it, repeating the same trajectory across the sky and pattern of becoming brighter for a moment.  The object wasn’t by itself there were others that came from different directions.  Same size. Small white, steady moving lights.;33.4228;-112.9528
Seen about 10 ufos in Tonopah Arizona.;2021-07-13 03:30:00;3 hours;Seen about 10 ufos in Tonopah Arizona. I walked out my house at around 3:30AM on august 13 2021 and saw what looked like a star move in jolts I then knew it was a ufo because of the movements, I called my boyfriend outside and we saw about 9+ together within the range of  3 hours, two stayed in the same section hovering around so as we watched those and saw the others in passing, most were headed south. One was headed north, this specific one flew the fastest leaving no trail just a fast dot moving , I chased after it and it stopped and seemed as if it came closer, I called my mom and we all saw as the ufo moved into the clouds, I was the only one to see the ufo close the cloud to cover itself. We watched this ufo till the sun came up to see if it would leave but no, as the stars started to fade into the bright sky the ufo was the only bright dot left in the sky within the cloud. It wasn’t until the sun fully came up until we couldn’t see anymore. Two ufos had what looked like headlights as well.! Others also looked as if they flew inside the clouds intentionally too. On August 19 me and my boyfriend saw another ufo in front of the house, this ufo stopped moving when we recorded and moved as soon as the phone was out away. Every single one looked like a bright white dot.;33.4228;-112.9528
