bright egg shaped object moving at an  incredible speed west of phoenix;2000-07-28 01:50:00;8 seconds;bright egg shaped object moving at an  incredible speed west of phoenix We(my wife and I)were driving east on I-10 outside of phoenix on our way home from California. The single egg shaped light appeared ahead and about a 30 degree angle up. It was a very white light about 3 times as bright as anything else in the sky with a slight haze around it. It sat hanging in the sky for a couple of seconds and then made a rough Z pattern only at amazing speed. It went up and to the right and paused then down and to the left and paused and the up but more to the right this time, the it paused and went straight up and either went behide and clouds (there were a few clouds in the sky) or went dark.;33.4228;-112.9528
