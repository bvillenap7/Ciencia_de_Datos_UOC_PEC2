Approx. 1845 hours in the W sky something appeared to be traveling from the W to the E making a 90-degree turn.;2017-12-22 18:45:00;8 minutes;Approximately 1845 hours in the Western sky something appeared to be traveling from the West to the east making a 90-degree turn heading south towards Casa Grande.  At first it looked a jet engine from behind only like the size of a rocket engine might look like.  What our attention  is  the back  that it was heading  the wrong direction if it was a jet  or some type of  large engine giving off a burn.   After making a 90-degree turn South, it looked more like a ball of Fire with a glowing smoke around it.  For approximately three to five minutes after the ball of fire was out of view the smoke glowed in the path that the object took clearly marking the 90-degree turn.  I briefly mention to my son it look like what the Aurora Borealis would look like up north in Canada or Alaska.  The fact that it continue to Glow and that we could not come to a consensus as to what it was made me file this report.;33.4228;-112.9528
