I was on my way towards San Diego, from Kansas. I noticed something hovering In the sky off the left car window.  AT first,  I thought it could be a drone I then,  proceeded to take video, and pictures. which I noticed this thing was moving very fast and also managed to change multiple shapes, almost into symbol like images. We were traveling about 75 mph,  and it kept up with us as if almost following us. At times it would veer here and there but for the most part it stayed alongside of us for well over an hour. It was Amazing!;34.3435;-111.5353
