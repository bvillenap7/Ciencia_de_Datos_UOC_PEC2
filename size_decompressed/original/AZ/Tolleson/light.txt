I had looked at the clock when I had left my grandma's house and the time was 7:24 pm. I started driving down 112th south till I got to Olive Ave I made a turn right to get to El Mirage road and along the way I looked to my left and saw the lights by Estrella almost like by Avondale and Tolleson Area South by the mountains. There was one light bright orange or like a street light glowing on then off then when it turned off it turned on a little aways from where it turned off. Another that was kinda by it was the same color and stayed on bright and then another was above that one slowly moving upward and to the right. I had seen the one move east from the south and then I came home to tell my boyfriend and we went to go look about 8:45pm and there was nothing out there....;33.4336;-112.2763
