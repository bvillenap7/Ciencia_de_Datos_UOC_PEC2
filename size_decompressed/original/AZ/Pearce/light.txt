Strange lights over several hous.;2020-12-15 20:00:00;3 hours;Strange lights over several hous. Over the past 7 days we have had multiple lights hover, move erratically, flash, disappear and reappear. This goes on for hours. Photo and video has been taken. At first we thought it was Border Patrol flying drones near our ranch, but it could not have been possible due to the duration and movement of the lights. Also, we have had several strange Government Vehicles from either the NSA or Homeland Security in 3 to 7 vehicle convoys spotted every morning driving to the area of our ranch. We are very secluded and very rural. The lights are near the Dragoon mountains which are 4 miles from our Ranch.;31.8898;-109.6076
