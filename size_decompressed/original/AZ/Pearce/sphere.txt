It was a large area of grey with a white sphere in the center.   ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.

I went out through the back French doors and looked into the sky directly west of our house.  It was the most unusual sky I have ever seen.  It was a large area of grey with a white sphere in the center.  I thought it must be a dust storm or cloudy sky, however the rest of the sky was clear and there were no winds.  My husband and I both thought it must be the moon and some unusual sky phenomena.  We continued to watch the area in question and called some neighbors and friends in the area as well as a friend in Phoenix to see if anyone else was  able to see this.  No one else could see it, though everyone was interested in what we were seeing.  After approximately 20 minutes it totally disappeared, just faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.
