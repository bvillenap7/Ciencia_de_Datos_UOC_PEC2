I pointed it out to my grilfriend who immeadiately got her binoculars and after looking at the red, aqua, and blue colors it emitted along with changing the placement of these colors she said it was definitely not a plane.  We watched it for about 30 minutes and it moved only slightly during that period.  After another 1/2 hour it had moved perhaps 5 degrees higher in the sky and then abruptly disappeared.;34.7705;-112.0592
