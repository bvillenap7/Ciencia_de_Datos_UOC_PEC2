Red UFO videotaped from Chandler, looking east.;2000-07-27 20:13:00;15 minutes;Red UFO videotaped from Chandler, looking east. About 8:13 I was out in my backyard and spotted the Red UFO again. I was looking east and it appeared to be about 10 miles away over the Apache Junction area. I had a video camera on a tripod near by so I started taping it again. The object is heading to the south or to the right on video. I lost it when it suddenly did an 80 degree turn downward and increased speed by 3x what it was just traveling. On the video it appears to be 2 objects close together with another object that is not lit up. This object is black and covers some of the Red UFO.

2 red UFOs over Gilbert;2000-08-04 20:00:00;17 minutes;2 red UFOs over Gilbert Observed the red UFO over Gilbert for 4th time. I was broadcasting live from my backyard lastnight when Bubba appeared at 8:00 pm. We saw that there were two red UFOs in the sky, moving together, slowly, about 1 mile apart. Each UFO actually had 2 or more lights inside, making it look like one object from a distance. Several commercial jets are seen crusing under the objects as they come in for a landing. The event was so incredible I took off the high powered lense to shoot wide angle shots of the UFOs and the airtraffic. We called a list of people with cameras in the Gilbert area so others got video also. The objects appeared to be moving south and raising in altitude. They disappeared around 8:17 and were 15,000 ft or higher. Tom King ((NUFORC Note:  We leave the name of the witness in, since he is an active UFO investigator in the Phoenix area.

But this night the two larger of the objects have been very low in the sky and very brightly illuminated. The two objects were changing colors very frequently from red to white to green . They were about 20 to 30,000 feet in altitude.Now at the same time we had noticed 4 other objects that were alot higher than these 2. From my perspective they are very large objects and all of them had remained vertually stationary for the entire duration .;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

Orange Oval near Chandler;2016-05-01 21:30:00;1 hour;Orange Oval near Chandler I saw 3 sighting of the craft though I could not tell if they were the same craft or different ones. Each of them were orange ovals with a small dark antenae like darkness within the oval. I attempted to record the object on my cell phone on the second viewing of the object. That video appears to be lost. The third attempt I was able to upload it to youtube. https://youtu.be/ixpqxQCsYjQ   The video is absent the details that were visible from human eyes adjusted to the dark.  The star was very orange and vibrant compared to the sky.  And the darkening on top of the object was noticable.  The planet next to the UFO is also not visible though I have a picture that shows the comparison with it and the local street light.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
