No sound I have seen this same craft before.  I believe the first time I saw it was in July, '03 around the same time (21:00.)  Both times I was out walking my dog when it appeared.  The first incident the craft came quite close--seemed to be hovering over my neighborhood.  The craft could go at different speeds and could be stationary.  This craft stopped in the sky and turned on what seemed to be a very bright spotlight beam.  Three lights were visible on the bottom of the craft at all times except when stationary.  It was capable of being unseen while it traveled away and then later appeared again with the lights back on.  I'm sure many people must have seen this because it was over the East Valley of Phoenix for some time.  I walked my dog and saw it, went back to the house, left in my car to drive to the gym about eight miles away and it was still visible in the night sky.  The most significant thing about the experience was the complete lack of sound from the aircraft-silent.  This was definately not any kind of a plane or helicopter.  I know what I saw.  I just wish I had a camera! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness describes self as a person who is involved in handling a considerable quantity detailed information.
