blood red object videotaped with 2 camera over Phoenix valley;2000-07-12 20:19:00;12 minutes;blood red object videotaped with 2 camera over Phoenix valley As I pulled into my driveway at 8:19 pm, I noticed a pulsing blood red colored object hanging in the eastern sky. I remembered reading about these red UFOs recently on this website a couple of days ago. I wondered if this was one of them so I ran thru the house and took a spotting scope into the backyard to observe it. I couldn't make out any further details with the scope other than a pulsing red light. Next I ran in and grabbed a Hi-8 videocamera and a tripod. I went outside to set up the gear. I taped the object on the tripod, then proceeded to place numerous calls around the Phoenix valley to other skywatchers. On the third call Jeff Willes answered and immediately gathered his videocamera with my 5X telephoto lenses I loaned him. He also videotaped the blood red object as I did with a tripod. We'll probably post stills or video on our website www.ufovideo.com in a day or so. Until then we'll be keeping the Phoenix valley under watch during the 7-9 pm time period for a while.

He will serve as principal contact in the Phoenix area for this event, which was observed, and video taped on both July 12th and 13th.  PD));33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

My family and I wathed this red circle of light for about 2hours. During that time,my wife called one the local news station's to report the strange red light but to our disappointment the woman on the phone said they have been recieving many calls about the red circle of light and not to be concerned about it,that it was only a plane. I don't know what it was but I can tell you it was no plane.I never seen a plane stay in one spot for two hours.My family and I took photos of the ufo with a 35mm camera. At about 23:00 hours the red circle of light disappeared but we could still see dark round shape where the red light was. We wathed this dark image head northeast for a short while as it blended into the night sky. As I said before, I don't know what it was but I do know it was not a plane......

ON THE EVENING OF AUGUST 15TH 2000 JUST  SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET I WATCH THE SKY FOR A BRITISH AIRLINE 747 JET THAT GOES OVER MY HOUSE EVER NIGHT ABOUT THE SAME TIME 8:00 PM TO 8:15 PM I'M VERY IMPREESED WITH THE 747 JET BEING SO BIG AND CAN TRAVEL ACROSS THE SKY AT SUCH A SLOW SPEED AND VERY LOW OVER MY BACK YARD. SKYHARBOR AIRPORT IN PHOENIX AZ. IS APPROIMATELY 25 MILES NORTHWEST OF ME. JETS THAT COME IN FROM THE WEST COAST PASS SKYHARBOR AIRPORT ON THE SOUTH SIDE. AS THEY GET READY TO SET UP FOR THEIR FINAL APPROACH THEY ARE HEADING EAST PAST THE AIRPORT. THEY BANK TO THE LEFT EVEN WITH MY BACKYARD. THEY START HEADING NORTH THEN BANK LEFT ONCE AGAIN HEADING BACK WEST TOWARDS THE AIRPORT ON THEIR FINAL APPROACH. THEY DROP DOWN FROM ABOUT 15,000 TO 8,000 FEET AT THIS POINT. WELL ON THE EVENING OF THE 15TH OF AUGUST RIGHT IN THE FLIGHT PATH WERE THESE JETS TURN I AND THE WIFE NOTICED TWO BRIGHT RED LIGHTS IN THE SKY NORTH TO NORTHEAST AT 8:15PM THEY WERE THE SIZE OF GOLF BALLS ABOUT 5,000 TO 6,000 FEET HIGH AND ABOUT 3 TO 4 MILES AWAY. THESE TWO LIGHTS JUST SAT THERE FOR 5 MINUTES JUST HOVERING. IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT A CLOCK ONE OF THE LIGHTS WAS AT TWELVE (12) AND THE OTHER AT FIVE (5). I LOOKED AT THESE BRIGHT RED LIGHTS THROUGH MY BINOCULARS THAT ARE 7X50 FIELD STRENGTH. AFTER THE FIRST 5 MINUTES ONE OF THE BRIGHT RED LIGHTS STARTED TO FLICKER THEN IT TURNED COLOR FROM BRIGHT RED TO A VERY BRIGHT AMBER COLOR WHILE IT WAS FLICKERING. BUY THE TIME YOU CAN COUNT OFF THREE SECONDS THAT LIGHT HAD DISAPPEARED VERY FAST IN A DOWN WARD AND EAST DERECTION. WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES THE REMAINING BRIGHT RED LIGHT ALSO STARTED FLICKERING AND IT TO TURNED COLOR FROM BRIGHT RED TO BRIGHT AMBER COLOR. AND ONCE AGAIN WITH IN A FEW SECONDS IT WAS GONE. AT 8:35 PM I HAD CALLED SKYHARBOR AIRPORT IN PHOENIX AZ.(602)273-3311 TALKED TO SOME GENTELMEN AND ASKED IF HE HAD GOTTEN ANY REPORTS OF THESE RED LIGHTS 25 MILES EAST OF THE AIRPORT. HE HAD TOLD ME HE HASN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE! SE LIGHT S IN THE SKY. NOTHING HAS BEEN REPORTED. SO I THEN CALLED THE TV NEWS STATION CHANNEL 10 IN PHOENIX AZ. THE REPORTER THAT I TALKED WITH HAD TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RECEIVING SWARMS OF CALLS ABOUT THESE RED LIGHTS OVER GILBERT ARIZONA. THE REPORT ALSO TOLD ME THAT HE HAD CALLED THE MESA ARIZONA POLICE DEPARTMENT. THEY TOLD THE REPORTER THAT THOSE LIGHTS ARE A MILITARY EXERCISE USING FALCON HELICOPTERS. THEN ON THE NEXT DAY AUGUST 16TH CHANNELS 3,10,12,15 NEWS TV BROADCAST ALL RAN THE STORY ABOUT RED LIGHTS OVER GILBERT AZ. ON 8/15/00 THEY HAD REPORTED THAT EVEN SOME PILOTS LANDING THEIR AIRCRAFT HAD ASKED THE TOWER WHAT WERE THOSE RED LIGHTS. A FEW PEOPLE EVEN GOT TO VIDEO THE LIGHTS. AND NOTHING SHOWED UP ON RADAR WITH THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT AIRPORTS THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY. THE MILITARY STATED THERE WERE NO EXERCISES TAKING PLACE AT 8:15 PM ON 8/15/00  THEN WE SAW ANOTHER SIGHTING ON SUNDAY 8/20/2000 IN THE SAME DIRECTION BUT THIS ONE WAS IN THE DAY LIGHT HOURS 4:10 PM UNTIL 4:20 PM IT WAS A WHITE LIGHT IN THE NORTH TO NORTHEAST SKY BUT IT WAS ABOUT ONE MILE HIGH.THE SHAPE WAS LIKE A THIMBEL IT WAS TURNING COLOR FROM WHITE TO YELLOW BACK TO WHITE FOR THE FULL 10 MINUTES AND JUST HOVERING IN ONE SPOT NEVER MOVED.THEN IT STARTED VERY FAST OUT TO THE EAST SKY.

At 19:15 p.m., November 8, 2000 our daughter phoned to tell us Bubba was back and to go look towards her house in the northern sky.  ;2000-11-08 19:15:00;15 MINUTES;At 19:15 p.m., November 8, 2000 our daughter phoned to tell us Bubba was back and to go look towards her house in the northern sky.  I kept her on the phone while my husband and I ran out to see.  We got our binoculars and the video camera.  While I talked to her, my husband video taped the light to the north.  We watched for 15 minutes.  It was directly over her house in Gilbert, Arizona on Cooper and Guadalupe in Gilbert, Az.  We saw a bright red light that vibrated and changed to amber, then back to red.  It seemed to float towards the east.  She said it was directly over her and she was looking at its' belly.  This is what she said...I'm looking straight up at its' belly and it's triangular shaped. The lights are pulsating and a tiny white light just went it in and came out again. The red lights went from extremely bright to dim, to amber, to just a faint red.  A few times we thought it had gone but seconds later it came back again.  We watched the object for about ten minutes then it did what Bubba always does---it just DISAPPEARED! My daughters' mother-in-law is visiting from Kentucky and unaware of our Bubba sightings.  She told my daughter she'd been watching the same red lights for the last two nights but didn't say anything because she thought it was just a weather balloon or something we commonly have in our skies here in Arizona. Watching from our backyard in Chandler, Arizona we couldn't see the triangular shape but we observed the pulsating red & amber lights for ten minutes until they disappeared before our eyes.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Response to orange balls of light seen: I've seen them since 2004;2005-09-15 21:00:00;20 min;Response to orange balls of light seen: I've seen them since 2004 I have seen these orange balls of  lights over the valley south of my location, that of which being Scottsdale. I am guessing that they were located over Chandler or the Queen Creek area. I have always viewed them at around 9:00 at night around 5 times since February of 2004. The last time I saw them was September of 2005.  My father used to be a pilot for many years and he too is unsure of what they are. He knows  that they are not flares since they stay at the same elevation for the entire 20min or so that they are in the sky and no smoke. When they disappear they simply blink out. I usually see a minimum of 2 lights parallel to one another, but I have seen 3 before.  I had never intentionally looked for these lights, each instance I just so happened to see them. I wish we knew what they were, but who knows if we will ever find out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

When we looked behind us we realized it was a UFO My friends and i were on our way back to base, traveling down I-8. About 5 minutes after we passed though Chandler, we notice some extreamly bright lights behind us. At first we thought that it was another vechile pulling on to the hghway, until we looked behind us. Our intensions were to tell the driver to turn off his brights but then we realized that wasn't a car. We watched the item hoover behind us for a few moments then shoot off towards the south and disappear. We know this can't an aircraft from our panet becuase it was so low to the ground (no higher than 10 feet) but we felt no rumbling of the truck, and heard no air craft noises like that off a plane. Also when it flew off it flew much faster than any aircraft I'd ever seen-and I see them everyday being in the military. This was undoubtingly a UFO.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

pulsating UFO sighted in Arizona, USA.;2007-05-24 04:00:00;approx.  5 minutes;pulsating UFO sighted in Arizona, USA. BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON OBSERVER:  I have been, for quite some time, extremely interested in the contents of our universe.  Of course, aliens being one of these things.  Ever since young age, these potential entities have perplexed my mind.  There were points in my life where I was almost literally addicted to the investigation of these phenomena.  ACCOUNT:  I witnessed, for the first time, a UFO at approximately 4:00 AM on the date of May 24, 2007 in the city of Chandler, Arizona.  Not being able to sleep, I decided to do some stargazing in the front of my home.  The object, which first appeared to resemble a star, moved at a steady rate.  The pulsating of light (which appeared to be spontaneous), was one of my determining factors that this was some form of advanced technology.  The UFO seemed to move at an almost constant rate of speed toward the southern hemisphere.  Then, in abrupt fashion, the object disappeared.  Almost immediately after I lost track of the UFO, a helicopter passed by overhead.  Do these two have any correlation to each other?  I’m not sure, but I think it is definitely worth mentioning.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

It was 10:30 pm and we were traveling east on Elliot rd between Dobson and Alma School. Just north of Elliot at roughly 400 feet were three circular orange globes.  Two were at 400 feet one was another 100 feet or so above the two.  I knew immediately it was a technology that officials claim doesn’t exist. We drove back and forth doing several u-turns while I told the kids, I told you UFO’s were real. If we went more than a block or so from the spot next to the road where they were hovering they looked like stars.  At one point while heading back west on Elliot my daughter said, Oh dad they are real close to the ground.  OHHH DAD they’re right there, I’m scared. All of the other cars were oblivious and obviously were not seeing the objects.  I would have missed them as well except at the exact moment that we were in the spot where they were visible my son asked me, Is it a new moon tonight?  So at that moment I looked up and made the initial sighting. On our last pass I had an image of seeing myself from their perspective in my mind and I blurted out, It’s a father with his two kids.   The moment I said that, the globe that was hovering higher floated up at a 90 degree angle, then instantly shot west at a 45 degree angle, then stopped in a position that made it look like a star.  We then left for their mothers as my daughter had become frightened.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Single flashing orb appearing just above the horizon;2012-06-05 23:05:00;2 minutes;Single flashing orb appearing just above the horizon I was standing on my front porch looking east one night sometime between January 2012 and May 2012.  I can't remember what time it was, but I know the date was after December 2011, as that's when I got the camcorder used. I noticed a line of horizontal lights close together just above the horizon.  I thought it was aircraft at first. But then a second line of lights rose just above the first line, moved slightly to the left, tilted slightly down to the left, and started shaking up and down.  I ran inside to get my camcorder, but it was gone by the time I got outside.  I dismissed it as an optical illusion and forgot about it. On June 5, 2012, just after 11 pm, I was standing on my front porch looking east when I noticed the same thing again.  I ran inside to get my camcorder, and that's when I remembered that I had seen this same thing before.  When I got outside and started filming, I was able to capture it, though it had apparently turned into a flashing orb hovering in the same location.  It never appeared to move and eventually just faded away.  The whole event lasted maybe 2 minutes.  It all happened in the same spot in the sky.  It was hovering 1/2 mile south of Ray Road and somewhere east of Alma School Road, though it's hard to tell how far away it was.  It was a clear night, the moon was bright and just past full, and was located about 15 degrees to the south and about 5 degrees above the object. Because I had seen this twice, and in the same part of the sky, I set my camcorder on a tripod, turned it on, and placed it on the porch around 11pm.  On June 15, 2012, I captured the object again, and this time from the start.  However, it only appears as the orb and does not first exhibit the line of lights as I had seen before.  Near the end of this second video, some lines are noticeable going into the object from the left and right side near the bottom. This has to be something explainable simply because it keeps appearing at the same time and in the same location.   Nobody else appears to be reporting it, and if I didn't have videos of it, I wouldn't be either. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness states that the date of the sighting, indicated above, is approximate.

It was approximately 3:15 AM and I was heading out my backdoor that faces to the south sky to take our puppy to the restroom.   As I walked out onto our back patio I saw a light shoot across the sky heading south.  At first glance I thought I had just seen a shooting star until the light returned and swiftly moved from the west to the east before disappearing.   The early morning was overcast so I saw nothing except a round light in the sky.   I was hesitant that this could be a spotlight but there were no other lights in the sky and the movement seemed too quick before disappearing completely.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Circular craft flying low with one steady green light and two alternating red lights.;2014-06-23 20:35:00;Unknown;Circular craft flying low with one steady green light and two alternating red lights. Made a noise inconsistent with a plane flying at that altitude.  There were flashing lights similar to those of a plane, but unusual: one steady green light, and two alternating red lights all in a line.   The object passed directly over me, and the lights revealed the shape of the craft - looking circular -- no wing shapes, just a circle.   It continued in the line and turned left out of sight.   Multiple aircraft were nearby, though none seemed to respond. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
