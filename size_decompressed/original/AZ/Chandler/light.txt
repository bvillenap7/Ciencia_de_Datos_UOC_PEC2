UFO drops liquid mettalics into my yard.;1998-07-18 02:15:00;24 minutes;UFO drops liquid mettalics into my yard. All I know was there was a glowing (white and yellow light) sphere levitating/flying that I could see outside.  The object was moving back and forth, remaining over my home and backyard tree.  It was as though there was a giant lightbulb in the air.  From my point of view, the light was as big as a large tire.  It was so bright that it lit up every inch of the tree that it was near. The air was just so still and unmoving, there was no wind.  There was no sound, it was an uncanny silence.  Something wasn't right. There was also a vibration that seemed to be shooting down upon my house with such a force that the cement floor beneath me vibrated.  The area was suddenly cast with a red glow and then it was gone.  Everything was back to normal.  What I had thought had only been a few minutes, turned out to be almost a half hour.  That spooked me.  The next day when I awoke, I thought it was just a vivid dream.  I walked outside and was throwing out birdseed for the birds, I noticed little droplets of metallics in the backyard.  Not one or two droplets but 5-6.  Stuff like that would never be in our backyard, and no one knew where they had came from.  But the really strange thing was was that the droplets must of been melted/hot when they fell in my backyard, because some had dried attached to something.  I heard once from an UFO report that people have seen UFO dripping metal, like the ships were melting. What I really remember is... I wasn't scared. ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to submit samples to NUFORC, and we will report on our attempts at obtaining the evidence.  PD));33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Two Red Lights Over Eastern Maricopa County, AZ on July, 25 2000;2000-07-25 20:15:00;approx. 1/2 hour;Two Red Lights Over Eastern Maricopa County, AZ on July, 25 2000 On the evening of July 25th at approximately 2015 hours I was walking my dog and first noticed a very low altitude shooting star with a very long tail moving quickly foover the southern sky, from west to east.  It covered the whole sky!  Shortly thereafter, I started walking east and noticed 2 bright red lights hovering over the Eastern sky.  I live in the East Valley (Chandler, AZ) and under the flight path to low altitude approaches to Sky Harbor Airport, so I first thought it was a commercial aircraft, but quickly realized these two red lights were something unknown. As I watched the lights one of them blacked out for a couple of seconds, then reappeared.  Both still in the same spot.  From my position, these lights were east, northeast at approximately 50 to 60 degrees from the horizon. It did cross my mind these could be flares, but there is noway. Anyway, suddenly one of the red lights fell to the earth, leaving the other still suppended in its original position. At 2045 hours the remaining red light blacked out for good. We do have a National Guard Unit around the Papago Buttes, but this sighting was way east of there. Anyway, please let me know if you receive any information regarding this!

These lights were stationary and appeared north of Chandler toward the airport.  The lights were extremely bright red and one was slightly higher than the other.  Suddenly the one that was highest just disappeared and a few minutes later the other also just disappeared.  I did not see it move at all.

Bright orange lights, that disappear and reappear.;2001-03-03 21:30:00;40 minutes;Bright orange lights, that disappear and reappear. My wife and I witnessed lights in the south east using williams gateway airport as a reference point.  One object was very close to the ground and 2 others at high altitude above it.  Lights would disappear and then reappear in different areas.  Lights were orange the color of streetlights and about 3 times brighter than landing lights.  I estimate objects at about 15 miles from williams gateway airport at about 20-30 degrees from where I was standing-except for the one which was close to the ground.  Sighting occurred in the desert.  Pretty flat, and farmers fields all around.(schnepf farms) is pretty close. No mountains around the lights, and no military ranges. I have video of the objects.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Light appearing in the north and flying south in the Phoenix sky.;2001-05-29 20:50:00;5;Light appearing in the north and flying south in the Phoenix sky. The object I saw was flying south at a very high speed. I first saw it was an airplane but this one was flying very high and did not have the red blinking lights all airplanes have and there was no noise coming from it. When it disapeared into the clouds there was an additional flash of light about ten times bigger than the object. This flash did not come from the object itself. This flash of light looked like one of those spotlights they use for promotions but it was not fully round and it flashed for about 2 seconds. All I want to know is if somebody else in Tempe, Chandler, or Scotsdale saw the same thing. As I said, it flew south so people in the Casa Grande, Arizona area would have to have seen the same thing.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

High altitude red star like light stationary of 5-10 minutes vanished without moving away.;2004-10-07 20:00:00;5-10 minutes;High altitude red star like light stationary of 5-10 minutes vanished without moving away. At approximately 8:00pm I took the trash to the dumpster in the alley.  It was a beautiful night and as always I looked into the sky to view the stars.Directly to the east and very high was what appeared to be a red star.  It was stationary, it was radiant like a star it did not flash like airplane lights but it was the most beautiful red gem like light, it didn't have the dead or mechanical look of airplane lights.  I watched it for a while thinking it has to move and then I'll know it is a plane, but it just stayed still.  I ran in to get binoculars and when I came back out it was still in the same location.  I could not get a steady fix on it with the binoculars.  Then it moved to the south in almost a floating, slow type movement.  It stopped and stayed put  again, then it vanished.  It did not move off into the distance, it simply vanished right where it was.  I am 56 years old have never seen anything I couldn't explain until this.  It was a beautiful light laser like, somehow it had life to it.  I also think the altitude was quite high.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

Looking out window on second story of home and watched what I thought was a single light from a private plane. Light was the size of a bright star moving west to east. Visiblity was excellent due to the setting sun. The area of the sky where I first saw the light was in between the yellow/orange sky to greying area. No clouds in that area. To my suprise, the light simply blinked out. If it had been dark outside, I would have thought it was turned off. But due to the excellent lighting, when the light went off, there was nothing there. Nothing but sky. Very odd indeed....Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD)) Glowing trail of orange-white light low in the sky accompanied by super-bright, blue-white light.;2005-09-22 19:30:00;30 minutes;Glowing trail of orange-white light low in the sky accompanied by super-bright, blue-white light high in the sky. I arrived home from shopping and parked my vehicle in the garage.  Neighbors were walking westward down our cul-de-sac street when they passed in front our driveway and asked do you see the light in the sky?'  I stepped out of the garage and walked down the driveway approximately 20 feet to the street in order to see a trail of glowing orange-white light low in the western sky.  This trail of light had a switchback appearance to it and originated in the west and traveled across the low horizon towards my location in the east.  This trail glowed quite brightly with varying intensities across the length of the trail for approximately 10-15 minutes and then slowly disipated and disappeared.  Above the trail of orange-white light low in the sky appeared a very bright blue-white light traveling northeast to southwest high in the sky at a constant altitude.  This bright blue-white light illuminated an obvious and very large cone of smoke or spent gas behind it as it progressed across the sky.  This light burned much shorter than the low trail of light glowed - perhaps 5-7 minutes.  When the bright blue-white light extinguished it did so with a momentary super-intense bright white flash.  After the high, bright blue-white light extinguished the extremely large cone of smoke or gas eminating from behind the light was still visible for approximately 10 minutes until it too disipated and disappeared.  Throughout the event I was looking at the western sky with binoculars and sighted 5 aircraft that appeard to be helicopters operating along the low horizon.  Local radio news reports broadcast on KFYI AM 550 in Phoenix, AZ reported the event as a top-secret satellite launch from Vandenburg A.F.B. in California.  I have witnessed several night launches of missles, rockets and space launch vehicles (some from Vandenburg A.F.B.) and none of these previous launches left a switchback trail of orange-white spent gasses in the atmosphere.  Further, if this was a vertical, space-vehicle launch, what explains the bright, blue-white light traveling northeast to southwest across the sky at a constant altitude and then extinguishing with a flash?  I could understand the news report as a satellite launch if the launch vehicle went out of control (creating the switchback trail of orange-white light) and the launch was pre-empted by ground control and the vehicle destroyed.  That would also explain the horziontal, northeast to southwest travel of the bright, blue-white light at a constant altitude, the cone of smoke or gas behind it and the momentary super-intense bright white flash just before the light extinguished.

Orbs West of Casa Grande, AZ;2010-11-11 21:30:00;30 min;Orbs West of Casa Grande, AZ Traveling from Chandler towards Casa Grande, AZ on I-10 East. Approx 9:30pm.  Observed bright object while fueling vehicle at Wild horse pass.   Clear night with a crescent moon.  Object was clearly not an aircraft.  Continued to periodically watch object while driving.   At a point I lost sight of object.  At one point I saw the 2 orbs in a formation and they appeared to make a sweeping turn, somewhat closer to my position, and then fade out... Periodically the objects appeared to fade in an out.   Size was relative to a streetlamp at about 300 meters.  Object was bright amber in color.  At one point when I viewed the object it appeared to split into 2 objects and then fade out.   Continued traveling past rest stop when object was viewable again.  Lost object behind mountains and when I was up to the 387 exit, I was clearly able to see the objects again, now there were 2.  Clear and bright.  I wish the cellphone I had could take pictures of the night sky.   Objects were very bright.  Mostly stationary.  I stopped for a few moments to look.   Proceeded to the Casa Grande Municipal airport to see if anyone would know what these objects were but the terminal was closed.  Formation of objects had changed, before being horizontal, now they were stacked vertically.  I tried to get the attention of a DPS vehicle to no avail.  Objects are very bright but I am unable to judge the distance.  Proceeded back home.  I want to ask if these objects have any correlation to the Gila Bend bombing range as I do not know.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Lights in the sky that look like stars or satelites, but do not move accordingly per the laws of physics.;2010-11-20 02:00:00;10 minutes;Lights in the sky that look like stars or satelites, but do not move accordingly per the laws of physics. First off, I am not under the influence of drugs or alcohol and I am a rational person.  I was standing in my drive way outside my house in Chandler, Arizona haveing a cigarette and watching the stars. I then noticed one star moving across the sky and I thought to myslef, Its just a satellite. but as it was moving I notice three more following behind the one I originally saw in a vertical column behind it, at the same speed. I then thought,   Just more satellites... but then they stopped completely and looked just like stars again.  If you call the starting point from the first star started moving as 0 degrees, and directly behind me as 180 degrees, they moved aproximetly 35 degrees to the west over the course of about two minutes.  After that two minutes, they remained still for about another eight to ten minutes before I went inside. It is entirely possible that this can be explained with rationality, but I have never seen this before in my 23 years ! of existence, nor have I ever heared of this happening before. I should also mention that I am a college student that is a Science/Engineering major, and know that this doesn't normally happen.  Unfortunately, I did not have a camera or video camera that can effectively record light sources such as stars in the night sky.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Bright Red Light in Sky in Southeast Phoenix Area;2011-09-15 19:45:00;15-30 Seconds;Bright Red Light in Sky in Southeast Phoenix Area I live in the Northwest Chandler area, near Phoenix, and while leaving my apartment heading to our local store I noticed a bright red light in the eastern sky. I asked my girlfriend, What is that?  We both stared at the red light for about 15-20 seconds trying to make sense of what we are seeing. I glanced back at my girlfriend to question the sighting as possibly a helicopter when it moved slowly east for 2-4 seconds.  It slightly flickered as if it was pulsing and disappeared into the night sky. The light source was bright red and unnaturally large to be a star or planet.  Since living in the city, the light pollution tends to overpower most stars/planets, this one seemed to dominate the night sky.  I would approximate its distance at 500-700 feet in the air.

Strange group of pulsating lights- My boyfriend & were driving to Tucson from Phoenix on Saturday night around 9 pm.  Heading south on the I-10 before the first rest stop my boyfriend asked me what were these 3 lights, in the sky, forming a triangle-  When I looked over (West)I saw 3 bright, very distinct lights in the sky.  I assumed, at first glance, they were stars.  He then said, “those are not stars”, & when I looked again, the lights took off, going south, at a rate of speed I cannot even predict.  Faster then anything I have ever seen in the sky-They were gone.    We continued, driving south on the I-10 when we both saw these unusual, lights that were moving very slow, going north.  When they were directly over us we could see that each object was 2 lights, (I don’t know if they were 2 different objects flying next to each other or 1 object with 2 lights) they did not blink but most definitely pulsed,they were a very bright, bluish light and they were going slower than any aircraft I have eve! r seen.  Two of them flew over, and when we got to the rest stop and got out we noticed the third one, flying north in the same direction as the others, same characteristics, no sound, and then it was gone.  Very strange, (and I saw the Phoenix lights & KNOW they were not flares)  I am not alarmist, this was as weird as the Phx. Lights.  I don’t know.

The light seemed like a streetlight at first, then I noticed it was too high up and farther away.  Then I thought maybe a star since the sky was clearing up and the stars were out. The light went from a bright light to a flashing series of lights.  OK, must be a plane.  I looked around and saw other planes in the sky.  One was to my left at eleven o’clock and heading toward the light.  I continued driving northbound and saw it out of my peripheral vision. As I neared W. Guadalupe Road, the light seemed to have shifted position slightly to the east, but was at the same elevation, however the plane to the left had slowly moved past it.   As I watched it, it suddenly seemed to pick up speed and took off like a bullet out of a gun, heading straight east and was gone in less than a second. I continued scanning the skies all the way to US 60 to see if it would come back.  It was gone.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

The lights were in close formation, quickly shifting and creating patterns/designs, then appearing to dissolve into each other.;2020-05-09 20:00:00;1-2 minutes;The lights were in close formation, quickly shifting and creating patterns/designs, then appearing to dissolve into each other. As I was hiking up a hill at Veterans Oasis Park, I noticed an ever-changing formation of lights that at first appeared to be aircraft taking off from Williams Gateway Airport. Initially, they appeared to be a squadron of jets with more seeming to lift off the earth joining the airborne collection. The lights were different sizes, but close together. Then, in 2 groups, they formed  similar/identical formations: like the shape of 2 stars, or child's toy jacks followed by a vertical double-helix-like formation, all the while, smaller lights appeared to coalesce into the bigger lights. within 1-2 minutes, all craft had been subsumed into the larger ones and all disappeared.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
