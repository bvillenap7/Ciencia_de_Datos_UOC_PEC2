5th video of red light in Gilbert area;2000-08-12 19:57:00;20:19;5th video of red light in Gilbert area On July 12, 2000 we proceed with our nightly skywatch for the red UFO. It came back. I was first alerted by a local from Gilbert that it was out. I was already recording tape but in the wrong direction of the sky. It took less than a minute to record the red UFO. This was higher in elevation than I've seen before. I was just outside 2 minutes before the phone rang and saw nothing. The surveilance camera had the area videotaped were it should of came from. So I guess it just appears in the sky. Again I shot more 80x to 100x video of this object. It was extremely red in color, you could see a double red lights in the viewfinder. With the naked eye could see 1 brightly lite light and a dimmer one just above it. It didn't seem to move much while looking at it directly but the videocamera revealed alot of movement. I was looking due east when I first sighted it at 8:57 pm Angle of view about 45 degrees. At the end of the sighting I was looking SE. The object was heading south and slightly ascending for about 10 minutes. Then it changed direction and started going straight up. When it got close to the cloud bank, it stopped for about 2 minutes. Hovered and moved around incredibly. Then it went up into the clouds and disappeared. The next day after talking to other spotters we determined that the object was in Chandler, about 2 miles from my house and less than 1 mile for the 3 commercial jets seen flying around it. This was one of the best sightings I had so far because it was closer to my house than any of the others so the video is much better. Tom King ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report is for August 12.

I saw a green, glowing saucer shaped object as I was walking south. It was slightly to the east.  It moved slightly, paused, then took off to the west very rapidly. The whole event took only a little longer than a second.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Craft moved from West to East across South Chandler sky.;2013-10-24 21:00:00;10-20 seconds;Craft moved from West to East across South Chandler sky. I was driving home from the grocery store at 9 pm on 24 Oct 2013, and turned southbound on Coronado Street.  I looked up towards the southern sky and saw a craft. The craft was almost saucer-shaped and had 2 to 3 dozen lights on it (in circular patterns starting from the middle outwards).  The lights were different colors (which is what caught my eye in the first place).  They were red, yellow, and blue mostly yellow, though.  The craft was of a grey color (it did not match the black of the evening sky). I stopped the car because I couldnâ€™t believe what I was seeing.  While parked, I watched as the craft moved West to East.  It was rather slow, but in total, I only saw it for twenty or thirty seconds.  I could not take pictures, as it was too dim to show up on my phone camera.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Black disk shaped object with 3 large yellow/orange lights spotted over Phoenix, AZ area.;2015-06-14 19:00:00;10 minutes;Black disk shaped object with 3 large yellow/orange lights spotted over Phoenix,AZ area My son first spotted this object.  I thought it was a commercial airliner, but it moved too slow, and also moved in wide circles.   At first, the look was metallic, reflecting in the setting sun.  But through binoculars, it looked completely black and donut/disk shaped, like a flattened basketball.  On one side (bottom?) were 3 or 4 really large circles that emitted yellow light that pulsed.  Sometimes the lights were almost invisible as the craft seem to tilt on its side.   It moved slowly to the South East until we lost sight of it.  The altitude was quite a bit lower than commercial airlines, my guess would be half that.   The size of the object, its diameter, was something like a school bus (guess).  Given out location the object must been been above Queen Creek or San Tan Valley, AZ, moving South East.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
