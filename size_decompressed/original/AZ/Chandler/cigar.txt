Falling fast vertically. I was driving home from work & after I pulled into my subdivision heading east I saw a long , bright green, string of lights type of object to the east/southeast.  It looked like approx. 7-10 small round balls, all green and almost like a green line or string connecting them. It was very bright green and was descending rapidly toward the ground vertically w/ a little bit of a curve to the string .  It looked like it was crashing. It was heading down and a little to the right (south) of me. The sky was very dark & there was some lightening, but this was definitely not lightening in shape or color. It looked like it was maybe 4-6 miles from me.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
