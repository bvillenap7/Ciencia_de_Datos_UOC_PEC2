Red light that remained still high above us for over 15 minutes and then dissapeared.;2000-08-12 20:15:00;15 to 30 minutes;Red light that remained still high above us for over 15 minutes and then dissapeared. A single red light in the sky. The light stayed in one place for over 15 minutes. I had time to go and get my video camara, call the local media and a friend and also video tape the red light. The light blinked a few times and either faded or flew straight up above the clouds and out of sight. I am a Police Officer and the following week, I believe on August 15th, callers reported seeing red lights in East Mesa and we were given this information on our car computers. The callers reported that they were UFO's. The Helicopter unit reported that they had seen the lights and thought that they were 2 helicopters flying in tandom.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Red Glowing Light seen over Chandler, AZ.;2000-08-12 20:20:00;15-20 min.;Red Glowing Light seen over Chandler, AZ. We saw a brightly glowing red light in the southwestern sky.  Looked to be round in shape.  It stayed stationary for about 15 minutes, before slowing disappearing into the clouds.  We saw at least 2 commercial aircraft pass close to the red glowing object.  2 people at this location saw the object.  Neither has ever seen a UFO in the past.  We have never seen a light in the sky glowing so bright and red.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

On the way back from work me and my wife noticed something like the bottom of a shuttle when its taking off. It looks like a cat paw on fire, it was pretty high but it never moved from when we noticed it we pulled up to our place and it remained on the same spot for  a few seconds then it moved upward where you can see the paw disapear. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be sincere, lucid, and quite convincing.  PD));33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
They looked like tiny satellites with thier solar panels extended.;2003-08-16 15:55:00;20 minutes;They looked like tiny satellites with thier solar panels extended. I was at the public pool in our neighborhood, along with my 2 children and my wife. While I was instructing my son (4 yrs old) on swimming strokes, I noticed a young man about 12 years old looking up to the sky. He approaches me and asks What are those things? I looked up and saw nothing. The sky was clear except for some high thin clouds. I asked him where and he points up to the high cloud and says they are in the cloud ,then they come out. I looked for about 2-3 minutes then spot 4 shapes that were higher than the clouds. They were nearly exactly vertical from our position on the ground.  They  looked like the USAF insignia without the star in the middle. (The =0= insignia on all Air Force aircraft.) The moved slowly and moved into a V formation. One minute later a 5th object appeared , it also moved into the formation then moved to the left of the rest. Another appeared and finally a 7th object came into sight. Four lined up in the attack formation, while the other 3 moved spread out to a sentry position from the other four. As we were observing the objects 2 boys asked us what were we looking at, we told them we were looking at something strange. They looked up and after approximately three minutes of searching, they also observed the objects. Once, one of the objects changed from a silvery color to a velvet-blue color than back to silver. The life guards also entered the search but could not spot the objects. They were higher than 30,000 feet as later I spotted a DC-10 at cruising speed and it was below the clouds. The sighting was over at 1615 hrs with only 3 boys ages 10-12 and myself being the only witnesses. I am 37 years old and a former USAF Sgt. These objects looked like tiny satellites with thier solar panels extended, and they were flying in formations familiar to me. ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the witness to have the other witnesses submit reports, as well.  We do not know what it is they witnessed, allegedly, but they sound interesting to us, given the other reports NUFORC has received recently.  PD));33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
I saw the low flying aircraft about 200 yards away flying at almost ground level and it had three filtered lights under the craft.;2004-09-20 05:30:00;2 Minutes;I saw the low flying aircraft about 200 yards away flying at almost ground level and it had three filtered lights under the craft. On the way to work at approximately 5:30 Am I saw an aircraft flying in a Westbound direction at a low altitude (Couple Hundred Feet). It was before sunrise and the sky was still somewhat dark but beginning lighten. The aircraft appeared to be similar in shape and 1/2 the size of a normal size airliner. I could see the left side of the aircraft and it had a shape of a tail section similar to a normal aircraft but I could not see any defined wings.The aircraft caught my attention because there were no aircraft running lights blinking on the craft and it appeared as though it was preparing to land.(No Airport in the area) The aircraft then made a move in flight where I was able to see several lights under the craft as it was getting farther away from me. I was approximately 1/2 mile from the craft as I was drivng my car Northbound in its direction.As I got closer to the area where I saw the aircraft, I lost sight of it. I looked to the West to see if the craft was actually making a landing in the desert to the West. When I looked in that direction, I saw for a brief second a large craft coming quickly in my direction from almost ground level and then swooping up in a upward direction back up to the sky. I could see what appeared as three dull or filtered circular shaped lights under the craft facing me as the craft darted back up in the sky. I believe there were two white lights with a red/amber light between them under the craft.I estimate the distance between the aicraft and me to be within a couple of hundred yards from my location and there was no engine or jet noise that I could hear coming from the craft.Because I was driving at the time of the sighting,I was unable to stop because there was other traffic at the intersection that I was approaching. It was my initial thought the aircraft that I had seen was sometype of test aircraft from some of the high tech businesses in the area (Orbital Launch Systems). I still cannot understand or identify what I saw as I was on my way to work. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
We saw a round, covered-bowl-shaped object, large as a house,of luminous white light,slowly move,hover, & float down out of view.;2005-05-24 20:30:00;10 min.;We saw a round, covered-bowl-shaped object, l arge as a house, of luminous white light, slowly move, hover,  & float down out of view. It was dark, but the moon had not come up in the sky as yet.  We were walking on a residential city block, in a populated area of town, near a couple of busy intersections.  I noticed two planes in the sky at the time.  One possibly private, coming from the east and closer to us, and one possibly commercial, coming up from the south west onto the scene slightly later, as the object was descending. We first noticed the object coming from south to north for several minutes.  It was moving very slowly. It made no noise, had no aura or beams projecting from it, and left no trail.  It looked the shape of a round bowl covered with a top that had a small cabin area in the middle center of it. It was very large, appearing to be maybe the size of a large house.  It was uniformly and completely lumninous, as bright as the moon, but much whiter. (The moon came up over the trees about 15 minutes later, from the east, and was yellow.)  The object then hovered for a couple of minutes, them wobbled a little,  giving the impression that it was turning.  I became aware of a very small white light, steadily shining, on the object's east side.  The object started moving eastward a short distance.  Then for a couple of minutes, it seemed to be bobbing, somewhat like a balloon on a string, bobbing in the air.   After that, it began to appear to float and sway slightly as it descended below the tree line and out of our view.   I have a BA degree, with 13 years experience as an administrator in social services.  Currently, I am a health educator with an internationally known, non-profit organization.  My daughter is working in retail and has just completed her first year at a local college.  We have lived in this area for 7 years.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

Strange three light object seen swooping over a field in Chandler, AZ.;2017-07-14 04:00:00;5 minutes;Strange three light object seen swooping over a field in Chandler, AZ. I am a truck driver who was driving in the state of Arizona on interstate 10 east bound between mile marker 181 and 182.  I initially noticed one circular bright light in the sky swooping down over a field then back into the sky at a high rate of speed.  As I noticed the light coming back around repeating the the same motion, I was closer to the object than before.  As I noticed the object swoop down almost touching the field only one light was on, then a second, and then a third circular light appeared.  Each light was evenly spaced in a straight line.   As this was happening, I turned my head out the window and looked back as the object was ascending back up toward the sky.  With the lights pointing up I was able to see the shape of this object. The shape of this object resembled a large rectangular wing similar to a wing on an old time wwII plane.  The side of this object opposite of the three lights had the middle part of this wing purtrud out in the center of the wing like a tab.  So that side was not completely straight,   The other side with the lights was straight with three large white circular lights in a row. I attempted while watching this to take a picture but was unable to while driving.   I have never seen anything like this during my 15 years on the road as a truck driver and wanted to report this and hopefully get a logical explanation on what this may have been. I have a sketch of this object as well that I can mail to you. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be unusually eloquent in his description of the object, and quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a highly capable, and highly reliable, witness.  PD));33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Saw 150+ yellow small parachute type objects in a random static pattern float southward;2020-02-02 11:45:00;13 minutes;Saw 150+ yellow small parachute type objects in a random static pattern float southward Saw a small light in the sky similar to an airplane light but it did not seem move at all.  Used binoculars (20 x 56) to see and it was a yellow parachute with a smaller chute off the back.  Then a few very small specs not really visible with the naked eye (smaller yellow chutes) came into view.  After some time more and more until there were maybe 150 to 200 or more with about 5 or 6 of the larger yellow chutes scattered about.  The scattered pattern didn't change but all very slowly moved southward and not downward.  It wasn't in a straight line either.  Could not see what was at the bottom of the chutes.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
