Sphere was aiming light like a flashlight on glowing smoke.;1999-09-30 19:30:00;5 minutes;Sphere was aiming light like a flashlight on glowing smoke. Solid sphere of glowing white light appeared out of nowhere in the sky as if someone turned on a giant flashlight. Approximately 10 or 20 miles away, the object appeared to be anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude. And at the same time as the appearance of the sphere was the beam of light shooting down from it at an angle. Very bright, far brighter than any light I have ever seen, for a moment I thought heaven was opening up and peeking down at us. The strong beam was pointed directly onto a glowing red, twisted, tornado-like cloud. The sphere, glowing cloud, and white beam were all stationary for five minutes. As the sphere and beam appeared out of nowhere, so did the glowing red twisty, tornado-like cloud, which appeared to touch the ground as a tornado would, but was totally stationary. However, the tornado did not have a cloud above it, as it just dissipated into the sky, about 1/4 the heighth of the sphere.  After five minutes of sitting totally stationary, the sphere and beam of light disappeared completely, but the red glowing cloud stayed stationary. Gradually, the glowing cloud dissolved into nothingness over a period of another five minutes.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Colorful, flashing spheres in the Chandler, AZ night skies on 10/05/07.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD));2007-10-05 21:15:00;3+ hours;((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD)) Colorful, flashing spheres in the Chandler, AZ night skies on 10/05/07 My sister has been observing what she called an object or colorful orb in the SE Chandler, AZ night sky for weeks now.  Each night she observed this through binoculars & the object appeared like flashing red, blue, green & white lights & even honeycomb shapes appeared on this object. On various nights this object could be seen in the NE & S Chandler, AZ sky. Tonight, Friday, Oct. 5th, 2007 at approx. 9:15 pm we saw the object from my house in Chandler in the due north sky. This object is definitely not a star as we’ve never seen or heard of stars being colorful or that move. Our planet doesn’t rotate that quickly. We observed this object with both binoculars & a telescope. We noticed the object was moving rather slowly but on a due east course tonight. The colors were absolutely brilliant & something none of us have ever seen before. Not only was it colorful & sphere-shaped but it seemed to rotate, spin, & turn sideways. It also would move just enough for us to lose sight of it from our telescope without us moving the tripod. We wanted to know what this thing was, so we came in to look up anything we could find on the internet that might relate to this object being seen by others & we found nothing.  At 12:15 am we went back out to see just how much further this object had moved, when we were amazed by the fact that not only had this object moved further east, but there were two additional objects exactly the same as the one we’d been following all night in a perfect triangular formation. They were not there prior to the earlier observation! We observed all three of them & all were exactly the same. One might say that they were hovering, but you could see them move slightly & yet all remained in perfect triangular formation. We really got a little freaked out, besides being cold & we came back in again. So this was going on for over 3 hours & then some! They are still out there very visible even now.  Has anyone else seen anything like this before, or know what is going on in our skies?    Inquiring sisters want to know Chandler, AZ;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
A shiny metallic sphere noticed for less then 2 minutes before it suddenly vanished.;2008-03-09 05:00:00;2 minutes;A shiny metallic sphere noticed for less then 2 minutes before it suddenly vanished. From the corner of Gilbert & Baseline Rd. looking in a west direction toward South Mountain I spotted a shiny round metallic object. I was going to pass it off for a plane but there was a plane in the same direction that had a chem trail coming from it. Why didn't this object have a chem trail? Adding further to the mystery it vanished without a trace. around 5:00 pm AZ    My girlfriend was a witness.  Same direction of numerous UFO sightings. fits the same area and description of a UFO scene by a close friend. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Glowing orange sphere spotted hovering and performing angular flying at various speeds.;2008-04-15 23:15:00;10-17 seconds;Glowing orange sphere spotted hovering and performing angular flying at various speeds. On 04/15/2008 I was leaving work at approximately 11:15 P.M. from a restaurant I work at in Chandler Arizona.  As I was waiting outside for my wife to pick me up I noticed a spherical orange glowing ball in the south sky at roughly a 40-degree angle from my position. The sphere appeared to be at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The object was hovering and appeared to be wavy like the surface was hot. The look was similar to magma and distorted like the surface of hot asphalt.  The object did not have what looked like conventional lights on it, but rather the whole object seemed to give off an orange fluorescence. After the object hovered for about 4-5 seconds approximately 2 miles to the south, it bolted off directly north, passing overhead and stopping about a half mile north of my location.  Again the sphere halted to an immediate stop and hovered.  When directly overhead the object appeared to be about the size of a house (1,500 square feet) the object at this point was at about a 120-degree angle.  The object traveled that distance in about 2 seconds.  The object then sped off at a 90-degree angle and immediately stopped again.  The object would not slow down and come to a stop, but rather come to an instant stop.  While accelerating the object would maintain a constant velocity and achieve its maximum speed at the instant of its movement from a stop.  After hovering in its location, the object bolted off to the N-NW in an upward 45-degree angle, disappearing from sight in less than a second. The object while in motion about 5,000 feet high was traveling a speed of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 MPH.  When the object sped off into the sky the final time, its speed was at least 4 times faster then its previous speeds.  The whole sighting lasted about 10-17 seconds.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
6 or 7 orange flickering orbs in a line formation over Chandler and Gilbert AZ on 10/5/13.;2013-10-05 19:45:00;5 minutes;6 or 7 orange flickering orbs in a line formation over Chandler and Gilbert AZ on 10/5/13. I was driving home from work in Gilbert, AZ, approximately 7:40 PM, turned left onto Alma School Road (heading south) from Guadalupe Road. After driving for about 10-15 seconds, a light in the sky to my left caught my eye.  It was travelling in the same direction as my truck, but much faster.  It immediately appeared to be something unusual as it was an orange flickering orb, flying at about the speed of a small plane, and probably a little lower. I was trying to get a better look, while not causing an accident, and finally had to pull into a small parking lot as I was now sure that this was not a plane or helicopter. After stopping, I got out of my truck and noticed there was another one behind the first.  I watched them going by for a few seconds before getting out my cell phone and taking a video.  Just as I started the video, the second one turned 90 degrees and headed east (it can be seen in the video doing this).  There was no sound whatsoever emanating from them. Only road noise is heard in the video. Looking to my left (North), I suddenly noticed that there was another one, then immediately after, three more behind the first three, in a straight line formation, all heading south except the one that broke off to the East.  The line appeared to stretch almost to the horizon.  As the line progressed south, another one headed east from the same spot that the first did.  I am not sure, but I think it was the 4th in line.  Seeing how far the line went, I kept wondering how many more would show up. Because I was trying to watch and describe what I was seeing on the video at the same time, I lost count.  The total was 6 or 7. Also, it was impossible to see any real shape to them because I couldn't see any defined edges.  It was almost as though it was approximately round, with the edges constantly fluxuating. Because they were orange, and flickering, I thought that they could be Chinese Lanterns, however they were travelling at a fairly high rate of speed, and when I got home I immediately checked the current wind speed on the Internet, which happened to be zero.  I took a screen shot of this, however it doesn’t show the date. I still have the video which is 2:42 and 291 MB, MP4 format.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
1-7 bright orange spheres seen for over an hour in Chandler, Arizona, near the Gila River Reservation.;2014-12-10 20:30:00;1 hour;One to seven bright orange spheres seen for over an hour in Chandler, Arizona, near the Gila River Reservation. At approximately 8:30 PM on Dec 10th, 2014, while driving home from the Phoenix farmers market, I witnessed 3 orange spheres in a triangular formation.   I was traveling southbound down Gilbert Rd, approaching the stop light at Queen Creek Rd, and the objects were to the southwest of my location.  They were solid orange and very bright.   I continued southbound on Gilbert Rd to Ocotillo Rd and they remained stationary or moved very slowly.   At 8:35 I arrived at my home near the intersection of Gilbert Rd and Ocotillo.  The neighbors across the street from my house were putting up their outdoor Christmas decorations.  I pointed the lights out, and they saw them too.  The objects had moved southwest from the original sighting, but were still clearly visible and unusually bright.  We watched them for a few minutes and I began getting things from my car.   The neighbors said, “The lights are gone,” and a few minutes later, they said, “There they are again.”  I stepped out of the garage to look, and snapped a photo with my phone.  This time there were two of them horizontal to the ground instead of three in a triangle pattern and they stayed lit for three or four minutes until they disappeared.   I went inside and told my father in law about the sighting.  A few minutes later, after getting my son ready for bed, I looked out the 2nd story window.  I saw that the three orange balls of light had reappeared in a straight line, parallel to the ground but were further west than before.   I ran downstairs to get my father in law so he could see them and we went into our backyard for observation.  They lasted for about 10 minutes before finally disappearing.   I finished getting my son ready for bed and sat on the couch to continue looking out the window. Around 8:55 the lights reappeared and I went to get binoculars.  The binoculars didn’t help due to low magnification capability and a few minutes later all of the lights faded out.  I went back upstairs and kept an eye on the area through the window.  Then at approximately 9:00 pm two lights appeared further away than they before, so I went to the upstairs balcony for a different perspective.  I took a few more pictures with my phone.  This time they lasted for ten or fifteen minutes before disappearing.  At 9:25 a single light appeared in the same area so I went back out to the balcony.  The light had moved closer to my position from the last appearance but I still could not tell what it was.  While I was observing this light, two more lights which were evenly spaced appeared to the far right of the original light,  a few seconds later two more evenly spaced lights appeared to the left, and finally two more lights which were also evenly spaced appeared to the left the other! four. There was a total of seven lights in a straight line. There were three sets of two lights evenly spaced from each other with the original light further to the left. They were above the height of the street lights from my point of view and above the tree line in the distance.  They lasted for a few minutes before they disappeared but I managed to take some more photos with my phone.  They all disappeared at 9:31 and I went inside. At 9:35 a helicopter flew slowly through the area. I continued to look out the window for a couple more hours but they never reappeared. The objects appeared to be near the Gila River Indian community and south of the Chandler Municipal Airport.  Being a former Air force Security Police K-9 handler and living near the municipal airport I know what planes and helicopters look like.   These objects made no sound, they did not have navigation lights, they were not Chinese lanterns, or any kind of drones that I am aware of.   After doing a bit of online research I found that lights like these have been seen in this area more than once this year and sometimes they occur multiple nights in a row usually between 8:00 and 10:00. I called the Chandler Municipal airport and the Chandler police dispatcher but they had no reports of unusual activity. I will keep an eye on the sky and maybe I will get a better glimpse of the objects next time.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

Four, red white blue and green, glowing objects flew overhead.  Did not make a sound.;2017-03-14 20:24:00;2 minutes;Four, red white blue and green, glowing objects flew overhead.  Did not make a sound. Me and my girlfriend were in my backyard, sitting on our patio furniture facing west.  I first observed at a distance, facing west, a white sphere.  Then right behind it I saw green sphere, then red then blue.  I first I thought the white sphere was the light from a plane or helicopter.  This is common where we live.   However, as the objects got closer, I was expecting a sound but never heard any.   I kept looking at them because had never seen such glowing colored lights on any aircraft before.  They were not blinking.  More resembling glowing balloons.  Were moving way too fast to be just drifting.   I caught on video from my gf's cell but was hard to make out.  Only some of the green glowing object could be seen.  It appeared to me that they were not connected together, but more like flying in a group, with no visible pattern that I could tell.   They flew overhead, not making any sound, and continued into the distance to the east keeping the same pace.
