The object appeared to be a dimmly illuminated flying wing approximately diamond shaped with squared off wing tips.;2002-10-29 21:38:00;10 to 15 secs;The object appeared to be a dimmly illuminated flying wing approximately diamond shaped with squared off wing tips. The object appeared to be a flying wing approximately diamond shaped with squared off wing tips. The relative size spanned the field of view of my thumb held at arms length (wingtip span same as length of thumb, forward to aft span same as width of thumb). The object brightness was approximately the same as average brightness of Pleiades. The dimness of the object prevented me from focusing on it to observe any detail. The sky was dark with closest street lights more than 100 yards away. There was no interfering noise such as traffic or aircraft. It was dead quiet as the object passed directly overhead from East-South-East to West-North-West. The object traversed a straight line at uniform speed and dissappeared out of sight 10 degrees above the horizon within 10 to 15 seconds from the time I first spotted it. I observed the object through approximately 100 angular degrees of the sky. The object moved into my field of view as I was observing Pleiades and thinking to myself about how clear the sky was and how well my vision was working that evening. I would not have noticed it otherwise. At first I thought it was a satellite but it was moving too fast and was too large. I was walking with my wife and when I said Look at that! she caught view of it immediately. All her impressions of the object agreed with mine. I cannot say what the alitiude of the object was but if it was at relatively low altitude (1000's of feet) then it was moving fast enough to break the sound barrier and if it was at satellite altitude then it would have to have been several miles wide. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a college-trained professional in a technical field.  We suspect that, because of his field, he probably is a very competent observer.

Diamond Shaped Black Object Hovering In Chandler Field;2008-07-25 04:00:00;2 minutes;Diamond Shaped Black Object Hovering In Chandler Field My brother confided this story to me a month after his observation. I believe 100% his story and observation as he is a very credible and responsible person. My brother who works for my company overseeing my night operations of my business got off work at 3AM. He lives in Maricopa so he travels from Phoenix to his home driving I-10. At around 4AM while traveling eastbound on I-10 as he approached the queen creek exit in Chandler he observed a dark diamond shaped object to his left rise up from a field about 100 feet and it then headed in a easterly direction towards casa grande. My brother said he was driving about 75-80 MPH and there were a few other cars on the road. He said the object made a few moves that made him think this was not a known civilian or military aircraft. It had 3-4 lights similar to navigation lights and it moved faster then his vehicle. He guessed it speed to be around 100-125MPH. He turned off his exit to queen creek/Highway 347 and proceeded on to the Town of Maricopa where he lives. He did not see the aircraft anymore once he left the Interstate freeway. I have lived here since 1996 after getting out of the military. I was in aircrat maintenance for F-14's and have been exposed to many types of military aircraft. What he described and its movements and speed along with no typical aircraft sounds associated with a jet engine aircraft or any normal chopping sounds of a helicopter type aircraft I conclude what he saw was either extremely new military technology not yet known to the general public or it was a UFO. I know there have been many unexplained events and sightings in the Phoenix area since I have lived here. Bottom line, I believe my brother saw exactly what he described as described. In my opinion, there has been to many sightings by too many people of various types of aircraft doing maneuvers that are just not known to be capable of modern aircfraft both military and civilian. Our current aircraft designs and more specifically, their power plants do not a! llow for this. Even a Harrier jet can not stop on a dime and hover, and when it is hovering, it is very loud because of the nozzel thrust it produces in the downward position. His sighting was a very silent aircraft leading me to believe it utilizes a high energy magnetic type power plant propulsion system and the earths natural magnetisym. Opposite type polarity propulsion system that have been engineered to allow for quite flight, speed, and maneuverability such as the new high speed trains technolog that use magnetics and ride on a cushion of air exist today, just not known to exist on aircraft at this time.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
