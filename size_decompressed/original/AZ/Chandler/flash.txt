My husband and I watched it for 25 minutes and timed the flashes, which were exactly every 10 seconds. We guessed it to be about ten miles up.  The object hovered in the same area, moving back and forth as though it were inching across the sky.  We watched through our binoculars but could not see any particular shape.  The flashing light was round, large and extremely bright.  After 25 minutes the flashes stopped.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Silver Metalic object with strong pulsating light.;2007-09-12 09:20:00;30;Silver Metalic object with strong pulsating light. Appeared in Northern sky. Silver, Metalic looking with strong pulsating strobe light near it's top. I watched it for about 20 minutes as it drifted to the East.  It was shaped (looking through binoculars) like the letter F or E with star like qualities. Strobing actions continued throughout it's drifting East;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Bright green light, Southeast sky over Chandler,AZ;2012-08-04 22:00:00;3-5 seconds;Bright green light, Southeast sky over Chandler,AZ Toward the Southeast sky in Chandler, AZ, I caught a glimpse of a very bright green light ripping across the sky from Northeast to Southeast. In the first second or two it had crossed my field of vision from left to right, and off over the horizon. Following behind were two choppers the choppers out here fly at angles different than the planes here. They seemed to be pushing pretty fast directly after the bright green light. The light itself shot off across the horizon and vanished within a few seconds, if that. That's all I saw. Observer background: Systems Administrator, IT;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Flashing multicolored object spotted above Chandler AZ apparently traveling outward into space in the high southern skies.;2018-02-04 19:50:00;4 minutes;Flashing multicolored object spotted above Chandler AZ apparently traveling outward into space in the high southern skies. I was observing the Orion Nebula with my 8 telescope when I first noticed a reflection of an object rapidly flashing blue, red, green, white, and possibly other colors.  I looked up and saw the object – it was close enough to distinguish that the flashing lights were in different positions on the object, but I could not make out its shape. I thought it was an airplane at first, but instead of it flying on a particular heading it was traveling upward and outward with a rocket-like trajectory.  However, there was smoke trail it as one would expect with a rocket.  Additionally, it did not emit any sound. When I first looked up, the object was about 70 degrees above the south-south-west horizon in the Aries constellation (near the 41 Arietus star).  The object traveled in an outward trajectory, heading south-south-east toward the Orion constellation, but curving downward toward the Eridanus and Lepus constellations.  I called my wife out to see it, and she saw it the last couple of minutes as it was leaving.  I tried to track it with my telescope, but it was moving too fast. As the multicolored flashing object was moving away it became smaller and fainter to see, until it disappeared completely between the 54 Eridani and the Epsilon Leporis stars, near the Eridanus and Lepus IUA boundaries.  The only difference between this object's trajectory and a rocket's trajectory is that it never flattened out – in other words, the object continued on a semi-parabolic trajectory, as if it were heading into space.  Also, the object appeared to vary its speed, but seemed to continue at a fast and constant speed as it disappeared. It took around 4 minutes for it to traverse the arc described above, and it definitely was traveling faster than a rocket.  About 3 minutes after it disappeared, a passenger jet flying west to east flew at an unusually low and flat altitude of about 1,000' to 1,500' above the ground, and it flew right over our house.  It was close enough to see the passenger windows and its configuration (either a 737 or an Airbus A320).  I presumed it was landing at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (aka, Williams Gateway), which is about 10 miles away from Chandler.  This particular plane was abnormally low, which could suggest that something was detected by radar, and that the plane was flying low as a precaution.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
