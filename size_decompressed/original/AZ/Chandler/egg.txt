On 12/31/13 at 1:00am ((sic.  January 1st, 2014.) I was standing outside listening and watching fireworks.  I noticed three orange orbs that looked like Chinese Lanterns.  However, these shapes would ascend and descend frequently, meeting up at the top.   Then a fourth came in from below and traveled across the horizon, then lifted up to meet the other three. It seemed like there was always a rotation of one being below the other three.  The area would have been over Southern Arizona (over Casa Grande) when looking from Chandler to the South. We watched, wondered and then went inside.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
