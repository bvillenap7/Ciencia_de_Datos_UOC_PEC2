ufo?? good reason to believe so.;2006-09-23 00:30:00;2 minutes;ufo?? good reason to believe so. straight above me i happened to look up as  either an L shaped or chevron shaped object was floating in a southwest direction. there was either very dim reddish lights or no lights on it at all. there was no sound emitted from the object as well. it was hard to tell how high up it was but it was not that far. me and a buddy witnessed this as it either floated or flew in a straight line in the southwest direction. it continued until we could not make it out any longer.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
