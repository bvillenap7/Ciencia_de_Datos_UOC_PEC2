large object sillouted in sunset hovering over estrella mountain.;2010-11-30 18:09:00;10 min +;large object sillouted in sunset hovering over estrella mountain. while driving down old price road to work at Intel Corp, I looked west to the sunset and saw an immense object silhouetted by the sunset. I stopped the car and tried to figure out what object was. The object was stationary or headed straight towards me. it was in my best judgement either behind or above the southern end of Estrella mountain. torwards and slightly north the town of Maricopa. The object had no anti collision lights whereas i could see other aircraft in the sky flashing their anti collision lights. It eas immense and I tried to figure out if it was a blimp or maybe a hot air ballon that was actually closer than I though it was. I stopped the car and tried to take pictures with my Nikon S3000 however it was very difficult to get the settings right in the failing light.  I watched the object hover until I had to report to work (about 15 min).;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Observed a grey unidentified rectanular object in the sky that paused and then moved quickly.;2011-11-12 11:50:00;10 Minutes;Observed a grey unidentified rectanular object in the sky that paused and then moved quickly. While heading north on Rt. 87 saw rectangular grey object to the far left of the road approximately flying at a height of a blimp.  This object was not a blimp, and had squared corners. Moving from east to west, at a good rate of speed, then stopped, remained at that location about 30 seconds, and then almost disappeared to an area farther west where we again saw it.  I thought it was a blimp, covering a football game until I saw the rectangular shape and asked my wife what that was.  Broad daylight, grey rectangular craft no means of support or propellant.  No windows visible.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
