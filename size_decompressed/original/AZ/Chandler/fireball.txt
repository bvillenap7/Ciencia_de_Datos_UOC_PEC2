Brief what appeared to be a shooting star, Bright green in color, and very close, and very brief.;1998-11-07 00:33:00;2 seconds;Brief what appeared to be a shooting star, Bright green in color, and very close, and very brief. While standing on the patio of place of employment here in Chandler, several of us where there in a smoking area. While speaking to an individual there, I watched him light up and the surrounding area with a bright green light. very similiar to that of the glow of fireworks or a flare overhead.  I turned quickly to see what looked like a large bright green shooting star quickly extinguish. Behind it was a streak of what looked like smoke approx. a hands length if you held out your arm all the way above you and looked at your hand.  Everyone out there stopped their conversations, and all commented on how close, and bright that shooting star was. We had all seen shooting stars before, however I can not ever in my life ever seeing one so bright, close, let alone green.  I wished to send you this information. I have heard of these green fireballs lately, and I really do not know if it was UFO, or just another falling piece of the heavens. Maybe someone else out there say it too??;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

It emitted two or three white light flashes from the rear after the first 30 feet of the sighting and then continued on between two houses at the same rate of speed.

Witnessed several orange orbs in the southern skies of greater Phoenix area July 7, 2012.;2012-07-07 21:00:00;5 minutes;Witnessed several orange orbs in the southern skies of greater Phoenix area July 7, 2012. I was taking the dog out for the last time last night and happened to look at the southern sky through my eucalyptus trees in my back yard.  I saw 7 or eight orange orbs in the distance all moving west to east at an airplane speed.  The sizes were all the same, about the size of a larger venus to a naked eye.  They were in some sort of formation and remained in this order.  One more came up from the rear to join the others.  I ran back inside and told my very level headed wife to get out here quick, which she did.  We both watched them as they all moved east and then eventually flickered out about mid &quoteast/west&quot. I can read online that I'm not alone in seeing these orange ones.  I've never heard of this color of &quotUFO&quot before and was surprised to discover it's quite common lately. I know there are &quotworlds without end&quot that populate our universe as it's nuttier to believe anything else, especially since the Hubble Telescope let u! s take a peek, however, I believe they are all populated with humans just like us.  So I'm thinking these orbs I saw last night are simply man made &quotsomethings&quot.  End of report.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Three fireballs flying close to the ground;2012-10-28 19:30:00;5 minutes;Three fireballs flying close to the ground Three UFOâ€™s were observed overhead flying close to the ground.  They appeared to be flickering, as if on fire, and were of an orange color and round shape.  They started flying in a straight-line pattern and then moved to a triangular shape.  Objects moved much faster than a plane would move.  There was no sound present during their flight overhead.  The objects were very vibrant and bright.  Observers of the event were an educator, nursing student, financial analyst, hospital chaplain, two retired persons, and a nurse practitioner.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

Object looked like it was on fire;2013-10-19 20:15:00;3 minutes;Object looked like it was on fire My wife and I were going to the store and I saw a light  that appeared to be an object on fire in the sky slowly moving from west to east.  There was no noise. We got out of the car to watch it and it continued at the same pace due east.    After it passed over the car thru a tree the direction changed to north-east for about a minute and then it faded out and disappeared.   It had the same exact coloring as a bonfire but it moved like a slow helicopter but with no noise.   I was about the same altitude as most light planes but moved much slower.    We live close to an airport and it was not  like any other planes;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

A ball of fire streaked across the Eastern sky as I was driving East on Pecos crossing Dobson Rd.  It appeared to be a crash, as the ball went down VERY rapidly. We heard nothing.

Four balls with flaming tails floating down slowly from the sky with directional changes.;2014-09-20 19:38:00;30 minutes;Four balls with flaming tails floating down slowly from the sky with directional changes On 9/20/14 at approximately 7:20pm my husband, 2 kids and myself were driving back from Casa Grande, AZ, and my husband and I saw the following:  We were driving north on Gilbert Rd. just past Ocitillo Rd. in Chandler, AZ when I saw two red/orange balls in the northeast sky quite a distance from us.  They were sitting at a diagonal from each other but too close together to be airplanes.  I pointed them out to my husband who commented that they may be an antenna tower.  I commented that it must be one crocked antenna because of the diagonal line they made instead of vertical. I dismissed them until 20 minutes later when we were on the 202 E just before the Val Vista Rd. exit.  I looked up at them and they were white now and, to my eye, looked to be about the size of the old large satellite dishes until they broke up into four separate balls about the size of basketballs.  I guesstimated them to be around 3-4 miles northeast from us and approximately 500 feet from the ground.  We pulled off to the side of the highway and watched them as they seemed to be floating down from the sky in a diamond shaped pattern.  As they were doing this each ball of light intermittently changed in brightness going between glowing bright with red flaming tails (like a comet) to dim white balls of light to barely visible.  They floated down slowly like a feather.  Each time one flared up the others did not. Also as they were coming down individually they were slowly changing direction in circular motions.  They eventually fell out of our line of sight behind buildings. They were moving to slowly with weird directional changes to be a meteor or something else falling from the sky.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

Multiple Aircraft circling and 1 bursts into a fireball and falls out of the sky.;2015-10-30 19:05:00;5-10 minutes;Multiple Aircraft circling and 1 bursts into a fireball and falls out of the sky. In the North Eastern Sky over phoenix as I walked to my car, I noticed several lights in the sky.  They looked like normal plane lights saw green, red and white lights.  They were moving oddly however.  They appeared to be circling and darting in and out.   After watching this for a minute or two, one of them burst into a ball of flame.  Then the fireball appeared to fall at about a 45 degree angle after a bit it started spiraling down, kind of like a tornado.  It soon disappeared below the roof tops.   Still ten minutes later I saw lights circling the area that it appeared to have gone down at.   I was facing more east then north.   If I had to guess at what I saw, I would swear I saw a plane get shot out of the sky.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

They were going from west to east and what looked like up as opposed to down but gradually not fast.   I ran inside to get my mother and her phone to take pictures.  It lasted about 15 minutes to half an hour.  My mother saw the same objects.   No reports on the news or internet.   Others must have seen them they were very apparent.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
