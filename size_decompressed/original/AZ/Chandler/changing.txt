They were not next to each other, probably a few hundred feet apart.  I was driving so I pulled over to try and see what kind of craft the orbs belong to, but I couldn't tell. I thought possibly they were helicopters, but there was no noise. Definitely not lights from an airplane. I kept eye contact with them until I pulled into my garage. When I walked out of the garage,the lights were gone, but I saw an extremely large black amoeba looking object moving low above the houses a few blocks down. I watched it and it just disappeared within a matter of seconds.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

However what caught my attention was I could tell the object was much bigger than the light portrayed.  There was a strange magnetic or electrical field or haze camouflaging the craft.  The light would be in one spot and almost instantly be across the sky.  It moved kinda like in a zig zag way.  Seemed like erratic movement.  It was absolutely silent.  No sound whatsoever.  At first I thought a strange aircraft was emitting a dangerous gas on the entire city.  It seemed to stop and I saw a strange electrical aura like gas descending from out the bottom.  Then I realized the craft was just descending straight down because it suddenly shot straight up and over and the auto around it went with it.  It was like I could see through whatever field was around it and could tell the objective was to be stealth. Never witnessed anything like it in my life.  I have a 4.5 minute video of it.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
