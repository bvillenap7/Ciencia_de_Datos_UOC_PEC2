Huge amber lights, intermittant, zooming and stationary, South of Chandler, AZ - 2200 & 2203 hours 11MAY2010.;2010-05-11 22:00:00;30 minutes / intermittant;Huge amber lights, intermittant, zooming and stationary, South of Chandler, AZ - 2200 & 2203 hours 11MAY2010. I am a security guard on patrol in Chandler, AZ (currently). I observed the UFOs first at about 2200, and saw two through trees.  I knew they were far away based on how fast I was moving and how the objects remained still as the trees obscuring my view of them zoomed past me as I drove by them. I saw two first.  They appeared as oval shaped amber lights.  My view of them vanished as houses obscured my view of them. I then proceeded with a patrol for work, then moved to another location. At this location about 8 miles North of the first, I again saw them about 30 minutes after the first sighting.  This time I saw 8 or more of these large lights. The first illuminated, about 3/4 the size of the full moon in the sky.  Then many more appeared to the left, and in a sort-of strobe like way the lights on the right went out and ones to the left came on.  They also zoomed around (though never moved far) they were not stationary. I pointed it out to some residents in a pool of the community I was at.  Only one of them locked eyes on it and only saw the tail end of it.  I told them to keep their eyes open in that direction. The event occurred South of my position in Chandler, AZ.  It is possible they were South of Queen Creek and Mericopa, two nearby cities.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
8 red-orange lights flying in formation near the 202 in South Chandler, Arizona;2012-08-30 23:28:00;~15 Minutes;8 red-orange lights flying in formation near the 202 in South Chandler, Arizona I was driving south on the 101 in Chandler, Arizona, right where the 101 becomes the 202 Santan Freeway, eastbound. I noticed two round lights (similar to the size of a car’s standard headlight from 100 feet away, viewed at night).  These two lights were due south of the highway’s bend.  I then saw that there were 6 more of these lights, all making a constellation-like formation, including these two in the middle (Total of 8 lights).  The lights were reddish-orange, with their inner light source, being a type of energy that seemed fluid-like within (molten might fit as a better description).  They were moving west at approximately 40mph to 45mph.  The lights were approximately 300 or so feet from the ground and looked fairly close.  While I was observing them, they did not drop nor travel any higher than their constant altitude.  They appeared to be between the 202 and Germann Rd. area.   I took the off ramp at Alma School Rd. and headed south to Germann Rd. where I then headed west for two miles, to see where they had gone.  All the lights were gone, except for one.  The light that was l! eft was now much higher and heading towards the Sierra Estrella Mountains, where it got slowly dim and disappeared over the course of about one minute.  I viewed this dimming from a parking lot off of Price Rd. and near W. Willis Rd.  I should also add that I had noticed a bright white blinking light (at a rate of once a second for the duration of ~10 seconds or so) that was miles away to the North.  I saw this earlier, when all the lights were still visible.  This white light seemed like an aircraft flashing its lights in the direction of these unknown lights.  This white blinking light seemed to be around the Sky Harbor eastern side flight path, moving west.  This would have been about 10 to 12 miles north of my highway position near the bend.  I have to assume there is a pilot that saw these and was signaling for some reason.  This aircraft did not change its course south.  I believe that aircraft was landing, but for some odd reason was flashing its lights in this direction.  I did not see any other planes flashing their lights in this manner.  I am an Electronics Engineer and an avid skywatcher.  I have also been known to chase storms on occassion. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

At first, my husband and I thought they were flares, but they were not progressing across the sky - it was almost as if they were rotating on a disc, appearing to move left to right.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
