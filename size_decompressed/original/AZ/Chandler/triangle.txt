My wife and I witnessed a craft passing in front uf us that was close to a mile long.This boomerang/trianglar craft became transluct ;1997-03-13 20:30:00;1.5 min;Summary : My wife and I witnessed a craft passing in front uf us that was close to a mile long.This boomerang/trianglar craft became transluct when it passed through the light of the moon. It was 8:30 pm., mst, 3/13/97, and I wasgoing to bed. I went to close the window,when three huge, white, bright lights caughtmy eye. A plane was crashing from SkyHarbor Airport in Phoenix, the angle andspeed would not allow a plane to survive.I ran to the living room, grabbed my glasses,and told my wife of 25 years, Get outside,NOW! Never said that before, in that tone.We were standing on our porch within 8-10seconds. This craft was 3000 ft. off thesurface. at least 1 mile in length. Thereis no doubt in our minds that what we wereseeing, was one object. It appeared to betriangular or wedge shaped. Three bright whitebeams of light up front, and 4-5 solid, non-blinking red lights on east side and rear.The moon at that time was at 45 degrees anddirectly facing us. I told my wife, We'llbe able to see detail as it passes in frontof us, directly in front of the moon. As thecraft passed thru the light of the moon, thecolor of the moon changed to dingy yellow,and we could see horizontal waves as itpassed. These waves were similar to gasolinefumes if one to take the lid off of a gas can,and look at the reflection of the fumes. Thecraft was viewed by us from a straight linenorth to south. It never moved irratically,nor did it make a sound. It was totally quiet.Our viewing sight was approximatly 2 milesfrom the craft. We witnessed a plane in landingformation pass right over the object. It neveradjusted its course. It didn't see it. I toldmy story to MUFON on 1-15-97. We were on,Strange Universe on 3/31/97 as witnesses tothis great event. The video on the news and tvis not what we saw at or near that same time.Our sighting was one solid object. We live inthe far eastern part of Chandler, and had anexcellent view point. This craft had no visiblemeans of propulsion and was totally quiet.Itnever changed course and went straight southtowards Tucson, Az. The object was dark andwas not big in height, but beyond huge inlength. We were back inside by 8:45 in totaldisbelief of what we had seen. It wasn't untilwe saw the news the next day, did we realizethat others had seen massive sightings. I am44 years old, married for 25 years, threegrown boys, and twin granddaughters, I am aUS Navy veteran, with 14 years education.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Fuzzy triangle sidewinds Arizona night sky;2001-03-14 22:37:00;10 seconds;Fuzzy triangle sidewinds Arizona night sky Went outside to stargaze before bed, looked west to see the constellation Orion. Both of us then noticed an object almost directly overhead moving to the east in a snake-like pattern. The object moved silently, quickly, and seemingly just vanished.  No immediate air traffic in its vicinity, and it appeared to be at a consistent high altitiude. Object appeared to emit faint red light from at least 3 lights side-to-side, and appeared to be a triangular shape, although somewhat fuzzy at the edges.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

bright lights in a triangle formation;2005-03-22 00:25:00;20sec.;bright lights in a triangle formation My wife and were driving down a road entering our nieghborhood,  when I noticed three lights in a triangle formation.  I pointed it out to her, and within 5 seconds of starring at it we noticed the lights began to fade within 3 to 5 seconds later the lights were completly gone.  The lights were about as bright as a plane in the distance, but they disappeared way too quickly and at the same exact time to be anything else but a UFO.

Pulsating triangular shaped object flying low, fast and silent over South Eastern Phoenix;2006-08-26 21:22:00;1min 30 sec;Pulsating triangular shaped object flying low, fast and silent over South Eastern Phoenix Object was first observed flying very low from east to west from the Santan Mountain range from the Gila Indian Reservation. The Object was tiangular in shape and was pulsating red. At first I believed it was a low flying aircraft. Then object changed colors four times. First it was red than green, than white, and back to red.When I say it changed colors I mean the whole object changed colors to include the lights.  The object was completely silent.Then lights were larger than the street lights in front of my residence.I am retired Military and Law Enforcement and very familiar with Military and Law Enforcement Aircraft and I have never seen any aircraft or weather balloon change color in the manner this object did. It was traveling very fast from East to West than switched direction and flew North towards Mesa and The Superstition Mountains.I realize there are many airports in the area but this object was silent,changed colors,direction,and moved at a high rate of speed.

Lights similar to the Phoenix Lights sighted in SW Chandler, AZ.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly flares over Gila Bend Firing Range.  PD));2007-02-06 20:05:00;3 minutes;Lights similar to the Phoenix Lights were sighted in SW Chandler, Arizona south of what is the Gila River Memorial Airfield While on my way to Safeway Shopping Center  South on Alma School about 100 feet south of Ocotillo Road in SW Chandler I looked up to the right over a fence and saw 4 Lights in a Triangular pattern and another to the center rear.  It appeared as though the object was dipping in the forward direction because the light in the rear was somewhat higher.   All the lights were the same color as I has seen on the reported Phoenix Sighting several years ago.    I turned right on Lake Street (west) at the next intersection.   The lights were still there but the rear light was no longer visible.  I sat in my car and watched the lights for a couple of minutes.  They appeared to be dropping to the right, and my visibility was being blocked by trees.   I turned around and went back to Alma School Rd And turned south and went to the next road by the Safeway Shopping center,  just north of Chandler Heights Rd.  The lights were more visible again for about a minute and then it lowered out of my line of sight.   So I went into the shopping center lot went into the store to purchase a few things.   The lights were gone when I left the store at approximately 20:15.   At that time there were the lights of several planes in the area where I saw the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Because of both the location, and nature, of the bright objects, we strongly suspect that the bright objects may have been aerial flares, launched from aircraft over the Barry M. Goldwater Firing Range, located near Gila Bend, AZ.  That is what official military sources apparently reported, shortly after the event had occurred, and we have no reason to doubt that claim.

Triangle amber yellow lights over Chandler Arizona;2013-04-21 20:30:00;30-45 minutes;Triangle amber yellow lights over Chandler Arizona I wanted it to be a airplane or airplanes in air traffic but it was 3 bright amber lights and they would stay stationary and then move all together in a triangle formation other planes and air traffic were all around so you could really tell the difference on the motion and the lighting of the aircraft.  I was 30 minutes out on the freeway going home from my friends house wich was a 30 minute drive away in maricopa, I spotted them because of how bright they were , as we got closer to my house we got closer to where the lights were wich was in chandler, by chandler and frye rd. so we get closer up and then you could see that it just stayed and floated in one position or another all in the form of a triangle. . moving and shifting from one position to another, it was also at lower altitude then some planes in the sky at the time , I would say the lights were 3 or 4 miles from me at chandler and frye rd. but saw them more then 30 minutes away from my house;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

I saw the lights first in front of me as I was pointed south on the on ramp.   I continued to see them to my right when headed east, but had to look away to stay attentive to the road, then I dropped to low.   I exited the freeway to go back to the location, but saw nothing.  I would estimate they were at a 45 degree angle up from my vantage point.   I have driven on this ramp 5 nights a week for the last 3 years and 3 months and have never observed any lights in this particular position.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
Trianglular lights that made no noise, dogs barking.;2014-05-17 08:30:00;five minutes;Trianglular lights that made no noise, dogs barking. All the dogs in my neighborhood started barking, so I looked outside to see what was going on.  Then, I saw a triangle formation of lights that were in an elliptical orbit.  They made no noise, ruling out any helicopters or airplanes.  They faded in and out, for a few minutes.  Eventually, as the last light faded, all the dogs stopped barking.  Weird stuff man, I aint usually one to believe ufo stories,;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186

Flashing red/orange  light looking like it was on fire in the sky near Warner & Dobson Rds in Chandler, Az then disappeared!!!;2016-02-29 19:20:00;10 minutes;Flashing red/orange  light looking like it was on fire in the sky near Warner & Dobson Rds in Chandler, Az then disappeared!!! On our way to dinner in Chandler this evening, our son saw a red, kind of orange-ish flickering light in the sky & it wasn't making any sounds but just flickering as if it was on fire but then it started moving!!!  Thought it was a helicopter or plane but showed no other signs to being one except by the semi-triangular shape & then all of a sudden it disappeared!!! I believe we saw a U.F.O. & with it so close to our famous anniversary of Phoenix Lights,  I wouldn't doubt it!!  After we got out of dinner a half hour later we saw three helicopters heading to the area of our sighting.  Nothing in the sky anymore at that time.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
3 bright red lights in triangular formation.;2017-03-16 19:35:00;1 minute;3 Bright Red Lights in Triangular Formation I saw 3 bright red lights flying in a triangular formation very low to the ground and in complete silence.  The objects were very low to the ground and heading west over Chandler.   The red objects would move closer to one another and then further apart while maintaining a triangular pattern varying from equilateral, to iscoseles, to scalene, in nature.   The frequency at which these lights were blinking were mutually exclusive.  They all seemed to make up part of a whole, but they were emanating light on their own accord with complete autonomy.  I immediately ruled out radar on a commercial aircraft because of the nature of the blinking of these objects.   After a minute, they disappeared out of my line of vision.  Shortly after, 2 helicopters appeared to give chase to whatever this thing was.;33.2898702325582;-111.84128744186
