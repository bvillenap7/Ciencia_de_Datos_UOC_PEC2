Perhaps their drones but they didn't seem like drones as they faded away.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-14 18:45:00;10 minutes;Perhaps their drones but they didn't seem like drones as they faded away. Returning home we witnessed numerous lights/orbs in the sky sailing/flying from the southwest direction towards the northeast direction. Numerous meaning that there were too many to give an exact count but there was well over forty of them. They looked as they were Xmas lights strung in the sky being pulled across the heavens in which no noise was heard nor emitted, neither were FAA strobe lights visible. From what could be seen was an endless line that faded out to the NE sky. Video via a handheld NV camera was taken but as they were directly above us, I could not keep the camera steady(the convoy of lights were directly above us and with the excitement it was hard to keep still) but in the video they are white orb type anomalies that just keep sailing thru the sky. No clouds were in the vicinity nor were any other commercial craft visible as it usually would be.;36.4083;-109.634
