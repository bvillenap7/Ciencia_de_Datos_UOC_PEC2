Weird shaped object towards South Mountain by Laveen 6-11-16.;2016-06-11 11:10:00;10-15 minutes;Weird shaped object towards South Mountain by Laveen 6-11-16. About 11am, my wife and I were driving south on 51st Ave., heading towards South Mountain.  We noticed a square/diamond shaped object with no lights to the southwest of us towards south mountain.  I try to catch up to get a closer better view it seemed to move further away towards the mountains as it seemed to have gone from a square shape, into a narrow diamond then almost looked like into two individual objects and back into one.  Then as we got to around baseline, it moved behind south mountain.;33.342;-112.1735
