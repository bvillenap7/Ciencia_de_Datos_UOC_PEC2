One light, then 2 lights west of Roosevelt, AZ observed by 2 adults camping.;1987-12-04 22:18:00;15 seconds;One light, then 2 lights west of Roosevelt, AZ observed by 2 adults camping. We were looking west while camping east of Tortilla Flat.  While we were observing the stars we saw a single red light lasting about 10 seconds.  After a minute of staring in the same area, we saw a commercial airliner going south to north and all of a sudden 2 red lights showed up.  In perspective, the lights were as large as the commercial jet.  With my hand extended, they looked to be about 12 inches apart (from our vantage point).  I am not sure how far away from us they were as it was night time.   They stayed in one position horizontally for about 10 seconds, then the southern one went up and the northern one went down, slowly at first, then quickly.  They both then disappeared and we didn't see any additional lights over the next hour or so.  The one that went upward seemed to moved extremely rapidly the other not so fast.  We were both in disbelief and asked each other if that just happened.   I searched an have not found any similar incidents online.  We were just merely out camping and saw these lights.  We are both professional adults.   Here is a link to the google maps link approximately where we were camping:  https://www.google.com/maps/place/33%C2%B038'02.1%22N+111%C2%B012'14.4%22W/@33.633907,-111.203989,154m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0;33.6358;-110.9749
