We had decided it must be a weather balloon untill it left at an incredible rate of speed to the south east. Before the object left we saw an airliner from sky harbor airport pass under the object. I live in the Chicago area and was on a trip to visit family in Tucson. The morming of the 24th. my wife and her sister and I drove up to the Phoenix area to visit a friend in Glendale. I had not seen him in 3 years since he moved to Arizona. We were in the back yard sitting by the pool and I was admiring the clear blue sky when I noticed the disc shaped object. We all saw it just hanging there and we all saw it leave at an incredible rate of speed. The next morning back in Tucson we also saw a missle test from White Sands that failed. The news had been broad casting info on the test so we got up at 4:00 am to watch, just thought I would throw that in even though it has nothing to do with the disc sighting. I am a 46 year old, have a pilot's licence and about 500 hours flying time. Am also into astronomy. This is the first time I have ever seen anything I could not explain.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

It was just getting dark and it seemed at first sight to be a balloon lifting in the air, but it seemed to level out and move steady at an even height and not gaining altitude as a balloon would have done. There was hardly a breeze that night. It had no noise. It seemed to travel at about 40 mph I would guess.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Saucer seen in Glendale, AZ.;2008-03-17 13:00:00;10-15 mins;Saucer seen in Glendale, AZ. Me and my husband were standing in my sister in laws backyard.  The sky was blue and clear, and there were no clouds at all.  My husband said look I think it's UFO. I looked and I saw it too. It had a tall chrome domed shaped top.  The bottom kind of looked like a cooking wok but it was solid shiny lacquer black.  When we first saw it there was a type of loud noise like a jet engine, and then it was quiet. It stayed in the same spot in the sky without moving. Then my husband said to go get the binoculars so that we could get a closer look at it.  So I went to get them in our car that was parked out front. When I came back, I went through the house and back to the backyard.  My husband came under the awning and got the binoculars from me. When we stepped back out onto the lawn the UFO had vanished.  The loud jet engine noise was heard again but we saw nothing.   Seeing the UFO didn't scare us though, and we both said it made us feel at peace in the moment like it was not there to harm us.  Neither of us were under the influence of drugs.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Saucer shaped aircraft with 6-8 white circular lights on its bottom side spotted near the dead of night by a cousin and me.;2015-03-01 23:55:00;60-90 seconds;Saucer shaped aircraft with 6-8 white circular lights on its bottom side spotted near the dead of night by a cousin and me. I want to clarify before anything else, the incident could have taken place either 3 months prior or 3 months after the date entered.  All I can guarantee, is that using information such as my work history, housing history, and the travel history of my cousin what we saw occurred within the first 6 months of 2015. No sooner and definitely not later.  The time and location however are relatively accurate, slightly before midnight and seen from 71st Ave and Bethany Home Rd and facing South. *All the information gathered here was obtained with the help of the other witness mentioned, all matching*   During a routine weekend at my father's house, my cousin spent the night over like he’d done a number of times before.  After arriving and spending some time playing video games I decided a snack was in order.  After realizing we were low on food, and starving, we decided to make a quick run to our local Frys/Kroger store down the street.  It was around 11:15 PM when we decided on this. Prior to leaving, and against my cousins wishes I decided to smoke a bit of marijuana to help with the pain of being an athlete.  As a long time smoker I knew this would not drastically impair my ability to walk and/or think and that it’d help me deal with the soreness in my ankles from constant soccer.  My cousin did not ingest any marijuana, alcohol, or anything of the sort prior to either arriving at my then home or leaving with me to walk to the store. 15 minutes of prepping and smoking, and 20 minutes of walking later we were nearly there. My cousin, slightly nervous about being out so late and being caught by his father, decided to call my uncle to check in and let him know we’d be in bed soon enough (a lie).  It was during this call that I, while gazing around the familiar neighborhood noticed something above me and not at all far away in the night sky. Only after taking 5-7 seconds to repeatedly blink and rub my eyes did I gather the sense to immediately alert my cousin as to what I was experiencing.  Above us were 6-8 near white lights, forming a perfect circle and a moderately bright one at that.  Past the lights, once hyper focused you could make out the dark saucer shape the lights were obviously a part of. There wasn’t any rotation of said lights, no pulsing, and no odd details.  The object sat stationary while being viewed and emitted ZERO fumes, projectiles, and strangely enough, sound whatsoever.  It was so quiet in fact that I recall the embarrassment of being able to hear my cousin explaining to his father/my uncle what we were seeing and practically revealing that we were outside and not in my home as he’d previously described.  I could hear cars driving by us and in the distance, I could have heard crickets if there were any, just not the craft. After about 60 or so seconds of staring, the craft proceeded to accelerate like no aircraft I’d seen in my 20+ years of living.  The object went from being the sole focus of my vision, to zooming straight upwards and decreasing in size within an instant vanishing almost cartoonishly.

The object was a few miles away but I could distinctly see the outline of the object because the sky behind it was much darker, whereas the UFO was more grayish looking. If was moving around in no particular pattern but it seemed to be moving relatively slowly as it was hovering. I continued to stare at it for about 15 seconds, during this time it did not have any lights on it, all I could see was the shape of the object, which was exactly like what all the stereotypical drawings of what flying saucers look like. It was like a disk shape at the bottom, and then a rounded ball shape towards the top. I know it sounds crazy, and I’m not usually any kind of conspiracy theorist, I don’t do drugs or drink. I work in law enforcement and was completely sober when I saw this, so it was no! t a hallucination. After about 15 seconds of seeing it with no lights on it, I saw it slowly begin to light up gradually into a yellowish shade, but only at the very bottom of the object. At first I told myself maybe it was just the moon, as it took kind of like a crescent shape from my perspective, however the moon was in a completely different area of the sky, and the crescent shape of the moon should have been facing another way if that was the case. I kept staring at it, the light was way too big to be any kind of plane or helicopter. Maybe 15 more seconds went by, and I watched the light slowly fade and dim. Not like the object had flown away... more like someone had turned off the light, and it slowly faded out. After the light turned off I was no longer able to see the outline of the object like I could before the light had come on.  I think whatever it was turned off it’s light first and then decided to take off very quickly.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
