The object seemed to be moving, like jittering about but still stationary.  It kept changing colors not flashing but pulsating from red to blue to yellow to green.  Not in that exact order.  So I took out my cell phone and started taking a series of pictures.  Now with the naked eye they just look like pretty lights in the sky, but when enlarged the most amazing details stand out showing what looks to me as a UFO constantly morphing or changing shapes and then cloaking itself and coming back. I would watch the object disappear but kept shooting pictures.  When I enlarged the photos you can actually see a spot in the sky where the object is and it seems to be covering itself with some sort of shield or as said a “cloak”   During this 15mins. I watched and photographed a 2nd object slowly rise from the ground til it was level with the 1st object with perhaps a hundred yards distance between them.  Now object # 2 behaved like object # 1..but with one difference.  Object # 2 mimicked # 1’s movements but shows like a mirror image beside it. Like object # 2 was casting a double image of itself  while # 1 remained a singular image. I would like to submit my photos of this event for investigation.   This event was witnessed by my wife and myself. Please respond if more detailed information is needed.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
