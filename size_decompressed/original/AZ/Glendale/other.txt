Object resembled  typical comet with rounded head and long vaporous trail. My wife and I finally had our first UFO experience while visiting relatives in Phoenix last weekend. The event happened about 6:15 PM just at dusk as we turned off I-17 and drove west on Happy Valley Road on the extreme northern edge of Phoenix.   The sky was partially overcast but clear to the west. I first spotted what I thought was a comet just above one of the local mesas.  I don't know its name, but it forms the northern rim of the little valley just north of Thunderbird Park. The object had a rounded head similar to photos of comets and as it rose from behind the mesa its tail also appeared.  The tail flaired out slightly as a comet might and even appeared to have a stream of particles glittering inside it. Being just at dusk, it was difficult to judge size and distance, but from where the object disappeared into the cloud (lighting it brightly as it passed through) it'd guess it was between 10-20 miles away.  From our perspective the object was about the size of my thumb extended at arms length. It took about a minute to reach what I'd guess is an altitude of 8-10,000 feet before disappearing into the cloud.  It ascended at about a 70 degree angle.  It appeared a  whitish blue color to me and was brightest at the head. I cannot explain what it is we saw.  I have a  knowledge of astronomy, spent 9 years in the airline business, hold a private pilot license, and regard myself as a rational man.  This didn't resemble a rocket trail or anything else with which I am familiar.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
The lights or fire that were dropping from the bottom were what made it look like something we have never seen.;2001-11-18 08:45:00;10 minutes;The lights or fire that were dropping from the bottom were what made it look like something we have never seen. My husband was sitting on our back patio  having a cigarette when he looked up in the sky facing North West.  He yelled at me to come out back to see what I thought it was that he was looking at.  It was rather high up so at the height it was it looked like the shape of a plane, but every 2 or 3 seconds a ball of light (or fire) would drop out of the bottom of it and there was like a circle of smoke or haze around the whole object.  My husband at first thought it might have been a hot air balloon but he thought it was rather high to be that and especially at that time of night.  It moved at a rate of speed similar to an airplane, continuing dropping this light or fire ball.  Gradually it moved to the South West and we lost sight of it.  The whole incident that we witnessed lasted approximately 10 minutes.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

Size was about 120% of a full I was able to watch and finally video a strange occurance late last night. While I cannot conclusively say that what I saw was an object or in fact a meteorological annomely, it can certainly be called unidentified.  I have a good amount of knowledge in astronomy and physics at a university level. In fact, science and in particular cosmology/astronomy are key components to how I make my living. It is this reason, that I need to really stay annonymos in this context anyway.  This object that I saw clearly moved slowly across the sky in an orbital path as opposed to moving along the ecliptic.  It can best be described as a cloudlike smudge not unlike a comets tail and was in the shape of a sickle when viewed edge on(with a 10% rotation on the x axis)  There was an occassional shimmering and small flashes as in traveled N to S.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Huge space craft like something out of a movie.;2015-06-10 12:30:00;7-8 minutes;Huge space craft like something out of a movie. Me and a friend we're hanging out, watching tv at my house.  It was pretty late.  We went out side to smoke a cigarette.  We we're talking for a bit, then I suppose I felt something in the sky move and when I looked up, I couldn't believe what bin was seeing.  It was an enormous space craft silently hovering over my neighbor's house, across the street from mine.   I told him to look asking him if he saw whatn i saw.  We both agreed that it was very real and amazing.  We stared at it.  It was unlike anything I've ever seen or heard reported.  It was a dark grey color.  And it shape was like a triangle with the pointed side facing south, then another two triangle shaped protrusions on each side of the ship pointing up towards the sky.  It appeared like it had alot of space inside like there was multiple floors inside.  There was a very large amount of window like squares with what looked like shiny redish, greenish, blueish and purpleish pearlescent squares all over the surface.  Also, many white lights next to the squares  that we're randomly lighting up. It looked like a large futuristic panel of buttons and lights. There was this wing like triangle coming out the bottom that had red lights on it. Idk what that was but maybe it was to not hit anything while that close to the ground or to enter a house . that's kinda what it seemed like.  We watched it go south bound very slowly and completely silent. We we're in awe and watched as slowly left our sight. It was so unbelievable that I didn't tell anyone for a month or two  and then when I did tell Ppl they didn't really believe me.  But I think I  found a story that was similar to mine but they couldn't explain it since they were not any where near as close as we were. I know I need to report this to see if anyone could tell me anything on what I saw. I wish I wouldve have gotten a picture. But I didn't have my phone and didn't want to risk going to get it and it being gone.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Bright star like object dancing in night sky for hours above North Glendale/Peoria Arizona.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star?  PD));2015-09-06 20:45:00;2 hours;Bright star like object dancing in night sky for hours above North Glendale/Peoria Arizona. We live in North Glendale, Arizona, on the border of Peoria.  Directly above us, we started watching what we thought was a common satellite until we saw it move in many directions, almost like dancing.  It would move east, many short bursts of speed, then slow down, sometimes hover/pause, then back slowly to the west, sometimes fast, U turns, circles, pause, then south then north, every which way.  (We agreed it was brighter and larger than a satellite.  Like a very bright star, but not as bright as a planet.)   We phoned a friend a few miles SE of us and they said  from their vantage point, it appeared to bounce up and down.  They told their next door neighbor who said they watched it the night before, Sept. 5. Unable to see it via camera.  We observed it until approx 23:30 then went to bed.  Will contact Lowell Observatory scientist on Sept. 8 upon their return from Labor Day.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

There was a bright light, multiple bass booms and then crazy trails left in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Reported as meteor.  PD));2016-06-02 04:00:00;5 minutes;There was a bright light, multiple bass booms and then crazy trails left in the sky. At about 3:55 am, me and a friend were standing outside when the sky suddenly lit up light lightning struck.  Illuminating the whole sky, but lasted for 3-5 seconds compared to 1 with lightning.  There was no sound it was absolutely silent until about five minutes later we heard 4-6 loud cannon like booms, that were powerful enough to feel slight vibrations. We also saw a slight illuminated trail in the sky in the north east.  Now that it i 5 there are two clear trails that are a swirl of paths.  Also there has been a car horn going all night (probably unrelated) ((NUFORC Note:  Object reported by the news as a probable meteor.  We agree.  See photos of smoky trail left high in the sky above Arizona.  PD));33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
