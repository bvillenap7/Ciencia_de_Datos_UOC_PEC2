As my wife was leaving the factory where she work, she takes a rather dark road to Camelback Rd. She saw what I could only assume were some strobe light, which lit up the car and the surrounding area and lasted until she made a left on Camelback. She thought it might have been a low flying chopper, but did not see or hear it. When she made the left the lights seem to go right and vanish.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Flashing object in the sky disappears within seconds;2010-08-10 20:20:00;10 seconds;Flashing object in the sky disappears within seconds I was getting out of my car and a bright light in the sky caught my eye. The light would dim then become very bright again. It didn't appear to be very far away. It was moving at a moderate speed. There was a small trail following the object.  I couldn't keep my eyes off of it! Within about 10 seconds after i noticed the object, it completely disappeared.  I told this to my fiance, and he looked at me like a had two heads. We went over to a friends house which was about 10 miles away from mine.  I decided not to say anything in case i had the same reaction i got from my fiance.   As we we're getting out of the car, my friend says, You will never believe what i just saw. Our stories were way to similar to be a coincidence. I'm glad my fiance no longer thinks I'm crazy!;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

My daughter and myself were leaving Grandmas house XXXX Oraibi, we were driving west.  We see two white flashing lights side by side traveling west.  My daughter said what is that...you could see planes in other directions and these were not moving or look like a plane.  We drive west of Oraibi then proceed to drive on North 63rd Drive and the west on Matilda Drive.  I pulled over so my daughter could capture it on her phone.  As she was filming a single white flashing light came from the South, then another from the east.  They synchronized in a line and proceeded to follow the first two going west.  We watched them until we could not longer see them.  I asked my daughter to look up who we should report this to. Then I called the UFO hotline.  We will be emailing the phone footage.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
