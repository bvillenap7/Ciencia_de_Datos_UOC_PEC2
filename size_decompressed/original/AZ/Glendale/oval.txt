2 Objects seen next to the Moon at approx. 8:30am.;2001-11-06 08:30:00;4 - 6 Min.;2 Objects seen next to the Moon at approx. 8:30am. Within 12 hrs of my previous sighting, I witnessed 2 objects next to the moon this morning.  At first I thought the one object was Mars and the other was another planet, however, both objects started heading North.  I could see them with the naked eye, however, were too far in the sky to see exactly what they looked like (look like 2 dots.)  They weren't airline aircraft (too high) and possibly aircraft from the local Air Force?  These 2 object were visible for approx. 4 to 6 min.  I checked them out through binoculars and thought I saw a red dot, could have been the sun's reflection.  I went out to the front, next to the driveway (at my parents home) and the 2 objects were gone.  If these were any type of aircraft and being that high, I would assume I would have been able to see the Cloud Formation from the engines of such an aircraft.  These 2 objects moved slow without have the Cloud Formation then disappeared. This is my 2 sighting of such aircraft/UFO in 2 days, within 12 hrs apart.

Hoovering red light in the north sky near Phoenix, AZ;2008-01-26 20:30:00;2 minutes;Hoovering red light in the north sky near Phoenix, AZ I walked out to my backyard around 20:30 and saw a red colored light in the north sky.  The light appeared unusual as it bounced up and down slightly a few times then stayed stationary.  The light proceeded to move up and down and then sideways.  I ran inside to get my camera and came back out to get some photos and the light continued to hover in the sky.  There was no sound associated with the light.  As I took several shots with my camera changing the settings and going in and out with the wide angle the red light proceeded to move towards the north getting higher and moving farther away.  The light eventually disappeared from vision high in the north by northwest sky.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
1 object sighted, 9 pm 4/6/2015 Glendale, Arizona;2015-04-06 21:00:00;2 minutes;1 object sighted, 9 pm 4/6/2015 Glendale, Arizona Just after 9 pm, I took the dog out in the backyard to go potty before bedtime, I looked up and there it was, at first I thought it was a plane crashing down, then it zoomed up, side to side, then up and down again..    I called out for my roommate , he came out and saw it too!!  It was purplish pink, and white on bottom,   with it moving so fast, it was hard to see the actual shape.. but it was round or oval.   Now we live near an airport and we see planes and helicopters constantly, day and night..  this was NOT an airplane or helicopter..    now you could see this thing as clear as you see a stop sign, and there's lots of traffic here , ground and air, now I KNOW other people had of seen it..    I saw a report of people seeing globes hovering in 1 spot for about 20 minutes, this is not what we saw.. we saw 1 object.. and from the back n forth movements..  It looked as if it was searching for something..  it was moving quickly and almost erratically.( it almost! looked like a object being held from a string..  like kids do.. but clearly this was not the case.. it was large.. but at some distance and that made it hard to gauge the actual size).  but did slow down during this duration and hovered still at one point before moving again..  then it was going away from us.. and we lost sight of it past the horizon.  I will have the camera ready tonight in case we see it again..  People rarely believe these stories until you see it with your own eyes..  I know what we saw.. and it was no plane!! or any other aircraft I've ever seen.  and while we saw this.. there were planes in the distance!!  There are always planes in the sky here, 24 hours a day..  So they had to of seen it too!!;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Orange/red ball floating in the sky over Glendale, AZ.;2018-04-16 22:05:00;45 seconds;Orange/red ball floating in the sky over Glendale, AZ. Orange/red ball floating across the sky from west south west to north north east.  Was not a fireball, but rather a fairly bright object.  At very end of sight, appeared to have a long tail from the end of the light.  Began seeing when directly above.   Never have seen anything like this.  Too slow for a comet.  But moving faster than a small plane.  Elevation seemed somewhat higher than a small plane.  Moved at same speed.  Did not ascend or descend.  Very small haze around the ball.  Did not leave trail while moving.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
