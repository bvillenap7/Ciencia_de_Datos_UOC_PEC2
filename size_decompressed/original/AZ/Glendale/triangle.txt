At an intersecton I saw a silent and motionless triangle in the evening sky.;2000-09-07 20:00:00;2 minutes;At an intersecton I saw a silent and motionless triangle in the evening sky. On the evening of September 7th, 2000, around 8 o'clock, I was approaching the light at the Cactus and 59th Avenue intersection.  A triangular object in the sky (at about a 75 degree angle, and about the size of my thumbnail at arm's lengh) cought my attention.  I was surprised by the shape, but especially because it was not moving!  There were three yellow or white lights, one on each end.  I was glad that the light was turning red because I would be able to take a better look at it.  My aunt was in the car with me and I asked her if it looked like the object was moving-she said no.  I rolled down my window and turned off the radio to see if it was making any sound. It wasn't.  Then, before the light turned green, the object started moving slowly and smoothly towards the west.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Shooting star looking object that moved quickly and freely across the sky for several hours.;2000-09-23 00:30:00;3 hours;((NUFORC Note:  See correction below.  We have corrected the date to 23SE00.  PD)) Shooting star looking object that moved quickly and freely across the sky for several hours. I was sitting in my backyard smoking a cigarette when I witnessed what I thought was a shooting star. It looked like a shooting star in color and quickness. But then it shot right back up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed. I have never seen any airplane move that fast. My husband compared it to the speed of a laser pointer moving across the sky. The object did circles in the sky, it went up and came down, moved east and then west. I thought maybe I was seeing things, so I went and woke up my spouse so he could see it too. He too saw it and could not explain what it was. It did not have the usual airplane red and blue blinking lights, it was a solid color, not really a color, but it glowed evenly. I sat and watched it amazed for about 3 hours. At one point it looked very low in the sky, to the point where I thought I could hear its movements. It sounded much like a kite sounds when it is flapping through the air, and it had more of a shape to it at that point. It had a a triangular shape to it when it got down low, and it appeared to be white in color, or maybe it was just glowing. It came down in circular movements, but then it shot straight back up into the sky. I know it was not a kite, because kites don't have such a range on them. I thought maybe a secret military craft, but this thing moved super super fast. I had a hard time keeping my eye on it at times. I had never in my life seen anything like that before. My spouse and I were equally confused as to what it could have been. I even called 911 to see if anyone else had reported seeing an object in the northern skies, no one had according to the 911 operator (at least not to her knowledge). I eventually got tired and went to bed. I have not seen anything or heard anything about it since. Shooting star looking object that moved quickly and freely across the sky for several hours. Just wanted to make a correction, I realized that I witnessed this after midnight, so it would have been 9/23/00.. not 9/22/00 as I previously reported. I am not sure if I need to retell the story, but I will. I was sitting outside on my back porch smoking a cigarette, when I saw what I thought was a shooting star in the northern sky, but unlike a shooting star, the light shot back up in the sky at an incredible rate of speed. I watched this thing move around, up and down, east and west, circling at times for about a half an hour before I decided I should go wake up my husband so he too could see it. I knew if someone else did not see it, no one would believe me or think I was hallucinating. I ran upstair and got him out of bed to come and take a look. He came outside and after about 3 minutes, he too saw what I was seeing. He compared the speed at which this thing moved to the speed of a laser pointer moving across the sky. The sky was clear that night, and I do not remember seeing a moon (may have been south of me as I was looking north). Someone suggested that maybe there was a laser light show in the area that night, but it was after midnight, and I would think that the lights would have to have something to reflect off of, plus there were no beams coming from the ground up. This thing was up there looking like a moving star. It has also been suggested that maybe it was a satellite, because that it what it looked like in color and size. But I have seen satellites in the sky before, and none ever moved with such quickness, and so sporadically. This thing was all over the place, doing dives, circles, back and forth, up and down. I was just amazed at what I was witnessing. My husband was not as impressed as I was, however he could not find a logical explanation for me. He ended up going back to bed after about 15 minutes. I stayed out side watching this thing until about 3:30 am. It moved all over. When I first saw it, I would say it was at about a 60ยบ angle, falling down like a shooting star to about 45ยบ then back up to about an 80ยบ angle. At one point it came down really low in the sky, however it was still quite small. But when it came down lower I thought I could hear it. The sound reminded me of a ! kite fla pping in the wind, and some of the moves it did (the spiralling downward) reminded me of a stunt kites' movements. I also thought I could make out somewhat of a shape, and it's shape reminded me of the Stealth Bomber, triangular in shape, but white, or glowing in color. It did not blink lights, the light stayed solid. It did not have the red or blue blinking lights like airplanes have. It did not blink at all for that matter. I thought maybe a remote control airplane (like the UAV) but this thing moved so fast, I had a hard time keeping my eye on it. Sometimes it looked like it hovered, but I am not sure, it may have been going up higher and away from me. I even went as far as to call 911 to see if anyone else had called in to report seeing an object in the sky. The dispatcher told me that no one had to the best of her knowledge. She offered to have an officer come out to my house so I could point it out to him, but I declined (I felt foolish). I watched it for a long time, then it started heading east, and I was tired, so I went to bed. I am still perplexed as to what it was that I saw that night. And I might think it was a dream if my husband had not also witnessed it. It amazed me, I was so in awe and so excited about it. I still smoke, and I cannot smoke in my house, so I sit out there every night hoping to catch a glimpse of something like that again, but so far there has been nothing out of the ordinary. I will never forget this as long as I live. I just wish I knew for sure what it was..and if anyone else besides me and my husband witnessed it.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
PHOENIX TRIANGLE U.F.O SPOTTED AGAIN- SEP/ 14/ 2002 AT 12:05 AM;2002-09-14 00:05:00;1:30 min;PHOENIX TRIANGLE U.F.O SPOTTED AGAIN- SEP/ 14/ 2002 AT 12:05 AM I had just stepped outside to smoke a ciggaret, facing dew south.  Just as I had lit the ciggarette a what I thought to be a shooting star appered out of the corner of my eye.  The only thing unussuall about this paticular shooting star was that it was fairly large, headed straight for the ground, instead of accross the sky, and it was so bright yellow I had never seen anything like it before. Then as soon as the shooting star faded, directly behind it I saw 4-5 very faint but organized what appered to be stars.  Except that these stars shaped like a rounded triangle.  And by that mean the lines we not straight but instead curved just so. Another characteristic that ws very peculier was that they to have moved very slowly but always staying the excattly the same distance apart.  Which may suggest 4-5 objects flying in formation or one large ship with just its perimiter lights on for lack of a better term. So in other words it just defined the outline of the ship.  The ship came out of the Eastern sky heading west at about 10 miles an hour tops, assumeing that in flying terms that is very slow. It almost seemed to creep along at a snails pace.  After heading west for about two solid minutes it then turned south and headed directly towards south mountain where alot of other sightings have accured.  I also believe that this is the same ship that was wittnessed on march 16 1997 over presscott, paulden, glendale, and then finnally in Tucson all on the same night.  This triangle shaped ship seems to almost haunt Phoenix, Presscott, and all of Arizona. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that it is surmise to assume the object described here is the same as any of the multiple objects observed on March 13, 1997.  PD));33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

silent triangle craft in North Phoenix;2009-04-24 18:00:00;10 mins;silent triangle craft in North Phoenix While looking thru binoculars at stars, planes,etc. I noticed a large triangle moving slowly from the Northwest. It is slightly overcast and thought at first it was the clouds making the stars look like they were moving. I noticed the craft was moving with a cloud , or what looked like a faint cloud.  So I placed the binoculars on top of my childs swing set and sat on the slide, as not to touch them and cause a false sighting. To my surprise the craft was moving and I had to keep turning to follow the it. It flew directly under the big dipper and blocked out many stars as it passed in front of  them. I eventually lost sight of it in the Northeast sky. each tip of the ship had a faint white light on it. The lights were not of a normal plane of any kind that I have seen, they looked like a very faint stars. Could not be seen with naked eye...;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

Changing color UFO, sighted 4/24/13 near Glendale, AZ. Recording at 9pm Arizona time.;2013-04-24 21:00:00;15+ minutess;Changing color UFO, sited 4/24/13 near Glendale, AZ. Recording at 9pm Arizona time My sister and I were sitting outside around 9pm Arizona time when we noticed an light in the sky changing colors.  As we peered closely it started changing colors from red, blue, to green.  As we started recording it, it started moving across the rooftops adjacent to us. But im sure it was about a mile or two away from us.  The object would do massive U-turs, spinning as it was in zero gravity then instantly shift direction.  It was about 2 miles south/southwest of Univeristy of Phoenix Stadium and as i started recording it for about 3 mins it would hover over then change altitude and direction at the same time. It looked like a Diamond main body with two small triangles attched at the left and right bases making one big triangle. but there were seperation between the 3 objects.  As it passed by a jetliner off in the distance you could see the jetliners flashing lights thru the dark parts seperating the objects.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
3 White lights over Glendale, Arizona.;2016-03-01 22:00:00;1 minutes;3 White lights over Glendale, Arizona. A large object with a flashing light in middle with 2 lights on the sides.  Flying lower to the ground than a typical aircraft or helicopter.  The distance between the lights would indicate a large size craft.  We listened for engine noise and heard none.  It appeared and moved in a fast side to side motion, and turned.  It then disappeared, but there were no clouds or buildings.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
