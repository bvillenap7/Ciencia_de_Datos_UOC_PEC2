one definite orb, standing still in the sky, and a huge craft with an immense wing span slowly flying above phoenix;2004-07-01 04:30:00;1 1/2 - 2 hrs.;one definite orb, standing still in the sky, and a huge craft with an immense wing span slowly flying above phoenix i was driving home with my girlfriend early thursday at about 4:15 am when i noticed what looked like an incredibly bright star or planet. i noticed it because i had also seen it in the same spot at about the same time on the previous morning, while i was riding my mountain bike. on the first night i immediately thought, it was possibly a plane coming in for a landing, that just happened to have it's headlight shining directly at me, cause sometimes if it is dead on, it can be incredibly bright. anyways, i kept pedalling, watching it almost the entire time. incidently, i was heading north/northwest, and the object, (the only one i saw the first night),which was east northeast, never moved, or at least not enough for me to be sure about it. well actually it moved, but it was very gradual, almost as if it was just traveling through the sky like the stars do. but i watched it right up to sunrise, and then i reached my destination, and sort of wrote it off as an incredibly bright planet. although i was sure that it was much brighter than mars, even when mars was at its brightest. i mean to say that there really was no comparison between the two. finally as the sun was approaching the horizon, there were just a few little clouds traveling due north, and i made sure to see if they passed behind, or in front of the object. it was so bright that i really doubted that they would pass between me and the object, but they definately did, so at this point i had no clue as to the actual distance. also by this time the object seemed to have gradually risen in the sky considerably. so i didn't dare mention it to anybody, for fear of ridicule etc... so when i saw it on the next morning while driving southbound on 47th ave. almost to my apartment complex, i just happened to look left, past my girlfriend in the passenger seat, and notice the same object. only, this time there were two, and both equally bright. however the second, southernmost, and lower elevation of the two, definately seemed to be moving, not far or fast, by any means, but definately moving!! so at this point i mentioned it to my girlfriend, and explained my sighting of the previous night. we both agreed that this could not possibly conventional aircraft. since we were less than 1/4 mile from my apt. complex i decided to haul butt home, and get my telescope, and my digital camera. when we got back, only the northward object was visible so i set up the telescope and tried to getit in my sight. first with the spotting scope. through the spotting scope it looked like an incredibly brilliant star, with all colors of the spectrum beaming from it, then when i finally located it with the high mag lense, i was fascinated to see that it was actually an orb, with about 1/3 of it (the southern third) intensely bright, as though it were an eclipse i was seeing. i decided that the most likely cause was actually sunlight reflecting off the surface. after a couple of minutes, the second object became visible again, and seemed even brighter than the first, and it seemed to be maneuvering slightly, as the light seemed almost to slowly wave back and forth like when somebody waves a flashlight across your vision. and it kept getting brighter. and it was clearly heading in our general direction. i caught it in the spotting scope, and it looked just like the first object, with all the colors and such. but i was having a hell of a time trying to get it with the big scope, cause at this point it was moving a little faster. then it seemed to be heading straight for us, and angled slightly downward. at this point i seemed to notice that, while still many many miles away, the beam was so bright that i could see it lighting the tops of trees between us and it. i would guess it to be about 20-30 times brighter than a regular plane heading straight it kept coming until it was barely a few miles away. i then was able to get my scope on it , though only for a couple of seconds, but it was so fast that i couldn't hardlysee it or make out the shape. i hate to do this, but i'm falling asleep, trying to type this report, so i must finish it tomorrow. but if anyone would like they can feel free to contact me, for more detail, and specifics.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
I wasn't going to fill out a report at all but I have had 2 sightings of 2 different objects in 3 days! I was outside working at about;2004-09-06 13:30:00;15 to 20 seconds;I wasn't going to fill out a report at all but I have had 2 sightings of 2 different objects in 3 days! I was outside working at about 1:30 pm and I looked up to watch a commercial jet liner passing overhead when I spotted a glowing orb (sphere?) behind and above the jet. The object was glowing quite brightly. It was hard to judge altitude on it. the object was traveling north/northeast and it was moving at least 10 times faster than the commercial airliner which was headed due north. I heard no sound from the object but the jet that was flying over probably would have drown out any sound from it anyway. The object left no contrail and I saw no other lights on it except for the glow from the object itself. It flew a straight and level course until I lost sight of it.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Bright metallic sphere that I can't explain.;2006-05-04 16:00:00;2 min;Bright metallic sphere that I can't explain. When I went to get tools out of my truck at a house I was doing landscaping at I noticed a round very shiny ball in the sky that was moving up at first then started a steady path up and to the east.  At first it reminded me of one of those gas balloons that are shiney silver, but this was perfectly round and not moving as a floating object would.  It was also bigger in size, but it was hard to tell exactly how big it really was or the exact distance away because of how it reflected the light.  There was no noticable sound coming from it or any means of propulsion. I just stood and watched it for a little while and then walked back to the backyard of the house I was working at and pointed it out to a guy I work with.  He acknowledged seeing it and asked me what it was, I told him I didn't know and we both just watched it continue on the same course for a couple of minutes until it was out of sight.  Because it took so long to get out of sight, I think it was bigger than what I initially thought.  Initially I thought it was very close and about the size of a basketball. I was a Crew Chief in the Airforce and have seen many different types of aircraft.  I also have a pretty good knowledge of physics and the principles that would be involved to move an object like that, and admit that it had to be something that I can't explain.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
UFO over Luke AFB Glendale,AZ;2011-09-25 04:45:00;7 Min;UFO over Luke AFB Glendale,AZ We were on a 2 week vacation in Arizona and were staying in one of the housing units on Luke Air Force Base which sets about 15 miles West of Phoenix.  It was on the morning of the 26 which was a Sunday when we had awoken early as usual and were setting on the back patio having our cup of coffee waiting for the sun to rise.  It was about 30 minutes before sunup when I happened to look into the Northern sky and noticed a bright white round object flying directly towards us at a very high rate of speed heading directly over the base in a Southerly direction, I then stood up so I could could see over the roof and noticed that the object came to a sudden dead stop and hovered in the sky almost directly over the base,  it then reversed course and flew back North at a high rate of speed and it came to another dead stop in the Northern sky about 4 miles North of the base, it hovered there for about 20 seconds and then it started to glow very bright just like a ligh! t bulb does when it is ready to burn out, it then shot straight up and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

UFO over Luke AFB Glendale,AZ;2011-09-26 04:45:00;15 min;UFO over Luke AFB Glendale,AZ We were staying in a housing unit on Luke AFB in Glendale,AZ which is a suburb of Phoenix, I would also like to add that we live in the Eastern time zone so we were waking up quite early being that Arizona is 3 time zones ahead of us and we enjoyed having our morning coffee on the back patio which gave us an unobstructed view of the Northern and Eastern Arizona sky and the beautiful sunrises. It was on the morning of the 26 of September 2011 which was a Monday that we noticed a bright white object in the Northern sky heading due South directly over the Base at a high rate of speed,  it then came to a sudden stop and stayed suspended in the sky directly overhead, then from a complete stand still it reversed course and flew back over the base in a Northerly direction at a very high rate of speed and then came to a complete stop once again about 3 miles north of the base, the object then started to glow and become very bright just like a light bulb does rite before it blows out and within 10 seconds it shot straight up into space and disappeared.

One  bright object , silent, no flashing lights, moving constant speed  several minutes until out of sight.;2012-04-10 19:45:00;3 minutes;One  bright object , silent, no flashing lights, moving constant speed  several minutes until out of sight. Clesr night, walking dog, happened to look up in the southwest sky, a single bright light was moving about the same speed as a passenger airline.  There wasn't any noise at all coming from the object and no wing strobe lights (typical) with airplanes.  It was spherical and approximately 2 to 2 1/2 miles overhead.  The crafts speed was constant for the duration of the sighting and traveling Northeast towards Scottsdale / Carefree Arizona.  Holding a regular aspirin at arms length would match the size of the object.  A passenger airline was about 20 seconds behind the object,and of course the engine noise and strobe lights of the plane could easily be seen and heard.  The light of the object was the same brightness coming toward my direction, as well as leaving and moving away and past where i was standing.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
This object was awesome yet very creepy and spooky. It shined like the shiniest chrome ever. It was completely quiet.;2012-10-07 12:15:00;20 minutes;On October 7th 2012, 12:15 in the afternoon. I was on the tennis court, practicing my serve.  When I tossed the ball in the air I saw a flash almost directly above me. My first thought was that it was a plane but quickly realized that it wasn’t. The object appeared as a long rectangle, like a steel beam used to build sky scrapers. It’s hard to know the exact length but I would guess 25 to 35 feet.  It was shiny silver in color. When I first noticed the object it was around 1000 feet and by the time the object had descended to 200/300 feet it had moved much closer in my direction.  Then the object stopped moving and just hung there.  I began back stepping and briefly looked to the ground and by the time I looked up again to the object it had changed form to a machine looking object made of silver balls. I drew a diagram of the flight pattern from when I spotted the object and I drew two different angles of the object.  The drawings are drawn from the best of my memory and resemble the object very well.....but not exactly. I had binoculars in my car and was able to see the object up close. I did take 3 pictures with my close to useless camera on my cell phone.  The pictures don’t show the object very well. I was awe struck viewing through the binoculars and by the time I had thought of taking pictures the object had traveled a good distance from me.  There are other reasons why I couldn’t take pictures earlier but it doesn’t matter. It is what it is. You have to zoom in on the photos and the object will come into view.  This object was awesome yet very creepy and spooky. It shined like the shiniest chrome ever. It was completely quiet. There was a black mist or haze surrounding the object that was not highly visible. I’m guessing that the haze served as camouflage, blocking some of the shine from the object. Traveling speed was 10 to 15 mph. The object would move a few hundred feet to the north and stop for a few minutes. Then move west a few hundred feet then stop. Then north, then south and so on. Until it disappeared in the western sky. Total viewing time of sighting was 15 to 20 minutes.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
10+ more orange orbs.;2014-03-29 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;10+ more orange orbs. at around 9ish pm, my 5 yr old went out back, exclaimed wow pretty lights   i went out and littered through the sky there were 10-15 orange glowing lights,  i called my 12 yr old son out, he went and grabbed my stepdad and mom,  while i got my telephoto lens my son grabbed my camera and my stepdad grabbed the ladder, by the time i set up there were only 3-4 they were heading eastward, a few disappeared over the mountain, (south mountain i believe) the others continued up.  i have 28 photos but because of being telephoto leaving the shutter open left them looking like worms, one you can see the shape/;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
UFO fleet of at least 15 of them travelling Northeast on the skies of Phoenix/Glendale, AZ.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-15 20:30:00;3 minutes;UFO fleet of at least 15 of them travelling Northeast on the skies of Phoenix/Glendale, AZ I was home watching TV and I realized that I'd forgotten my reading glasses in my car so around 8:30pm I stepped out to the driveway to get them... I always lookup for Orion's belt and the Pleiades and this time was not the exception it was when I noticed an object, high in the sky, like a star, moving Northeast... then I look further southwest and I saw that it was several of them travelling one after another at a steady speed I have the impression of that the first 7 objects I saw were aligned in a straight line, but then I noticed that far behing there was other objects to the right and to the left of the original path all of them going in the same direction, I don't know if prior me showing up outside other objects passed, but I counted at least 15 objects... I yelled to my son and my daughter to come out see them eventually, they came out and were able to see several of them... the objects were not travelling very close to each other, they were sp! aced out, so it took like 2/3 minutes to see them all fade away in the dark sky.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
