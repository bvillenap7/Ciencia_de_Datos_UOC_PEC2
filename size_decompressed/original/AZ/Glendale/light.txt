UFO seen by USAF Air Traffic Controller and the entire 4 man crew at Luke AFB in August 1974.;1974-08-10 13:00:00;45 minutes;UFO seen by USAF Air Traffic Controller and the entire 4 man crew at Luke AFB in August 1974.  While on duty as the Tower Chief at Luke Air Force Base in 1974 we in the tower received a call from Command Post over the Hot Line at which time the Col. on the other end said that a resident of a nearby community called Sun City believes she see a UFO and ask us to speak with her.  I a Staff Sargent and the senior NCO in the tower took the call.  Immediately the lady started directing us to look West just above the White Tank Mountain range at which time she pointed out a rather bright glowing object located approximately 15-20 degrees above the peak of the White Tanks.  At first glance it looked somewhat like a star.  She kept asking us over and over do you see it, do you see it? to which we answered, no.  I wish to point out at this time that we lied to the lady.  We saw the object all too well.  But, due to the extremely heavy amount of paperwork we would have to undergo not to mention a psychological assessment we answered her, no and that was a lie.  To this day I regret lying to this lady.  The actual incident was as follows.  The UFO was real and clearly visible.  It glowed orange to red and seem to move all about at approx 2-10 degrees each time it moved.  We observed this object for over a 45 minute period and suddenly, and literally in the blink of an eye it shot up and off to the right (North)at about a 15 degree angle off vertical and suddenly it was gone.  The object departed in what I call the speed of thought.  To this day my greatest regret is not validating the ladies comments who called us as she asked them and let her know her eyes were not lying to her but were real.  I at 66 years old that the UFO was as real as I am.  I record this incident at this time to support the truth movement in UFOs and promise to support the movement from this time forward as I have for the past 20+ years.  As a former Staff Sargent in the USAF, and a Tower Crew Chief at the Luke AFB Control Tower, a Former Phoenix Firefighter/Engineer, Business Owner, a Jet Aircraft Mechanic for Lockheed Martin and NASA, a Husband, Father and an American Patriot I promise you these comments are true and honest.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Stationary object SW of the Phoenix AZ area seen over several nights. Quit appearing after the Mar 13 incident in Phoenix.;1997-03-12 21:50:00;over 3 weeks;Summary : Stationary object SW of the Phoenix AZ area seen over several nights. Quit appearing after the Mar 13 incident in Phoenix. Over about a two week period I noticed a single light in the sky at about the area of the estrella mountains south west of Phoenix. I thought it odd because I am not aware of any roads or power lines in the Estrella mountains. The light was a yellow light similar in appearance to a low power sodium vapor street light. Observed at about the same angle that the peak of the highest peak of the Estrella mountains would be from my observation point. (I had concluded that because it did not move that somehow someone had installed a street light on top of the Estrella Mtns). I did notice that it would occaisionaly fade out and later reappear in the same spot. This light was last observed on Mar 12 the day before the mutiple lights observed across Arizona. The yellow light description of the multiple lights reminded me of what I had been observing, so I double checked the angles from various reference points where I had observed the light and consistently found that that the locatio!n where I had rembered the light being was further west than where the mountains are located. This would place the light in open sky rather than on one of the peaks.I did observe this light on several different nights at various locations several miles apart. The object's aparent location was consistantly in the same area which would place it approximatly 20 miles south of Luke Air Force Base or about 20 miles ssw of downtown Glendale at an altitude of about 1000 ft (comparable to the nearby mountain peaks).Despite looking for it, this light has not re-appeared since the major event of lights here in AZ;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

My friend called me and said go out and look east I am video taping a red ufo. So I went out with my sony 8mm and there it was. It was a red ufo. It would pulsate rhythmically. I taped it for about 5 min. And then he said he lost it, but I had the thing locked in the camera. At that moment a white ufo shot over the top of the red one I was taping. I caught both of them on the tripod. The red one then was gone. The white one that shot over the red one was going so fast it was frightening.

Fast moving light in N.W. Phoenix.;2000-11-12 06:20:00;3-4 minutes;Fast moving light in N.W. Phoenix. At about 6:20 am MST on Sunday, November 12th,  I was going outside to Get my paper, when and saw it wasn't there yet so I turned to go back inside and saw a light about the size of a big star moving towards me from the  South West.  The first thing I noticed was that it was moving fast and smoothly. I thought UFO? Then I thought  no, Airforce jet. Then I realized it was moving too fast,  and had an odd floating sense about it. I continued to watch and it wavered a litle twice which tipped me off that wasn't a conventional craft.  It started at about twenty degrees off the horizon and kept coming towards me and slightly curving. It started out about the size of a big star and was the size of high altitude aircraft light. It was either very high and moving VERY fast, or very low and EXTREMELY small. There was absolutely no noise,  It was just after dawn and the full moon was low to the W. Northwest so there was plenty of light to see if there any conventional stucture. There was none.  The light was white and there were no other colored lights to indicate any kind of coventional craft.   It continued to move overhead and to the Northeast until it was out of site. The whole thing too k 3-4 minutes and it moved faster than any plane at a high altitude, even the airforce jets of which I am familiar with.  I have spent most of my 37 years in phoenix and have been watching the Phoenix skies since I was a kid, but very consistantly for the past 16 years. I spent  I am very familiar with the air traffic in the area. I spent ten of those years outside at night almost every night for 5-8 hours because of insomnia, and because as an actor and artist I have a very hard time winding down after  work. For the past 2 years I have been riding my bike at night for 1-4 hours.  I have seen many UFO's in the past four years in the valley. It has become almost common place. I tried to report one to you several years ago but was followed by what I realized was a man in black, and had someone come into my back yard one night! and was just a couple of feet from my open screened window.  I thought I woud try the website this time.  I have better than 20-20 vision, and excellent night vision which I didn't need this time because there was plenty of light.   I had the odd sensation that itor they knew I was watching it.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Mid-morning 11:30, clear skies, I watched three lights with erratic movement for 30 minutes before disappearing.;2002-05-01 11:30:00;30 minutes;Mid-morning 11:30, clear skies, I watched three lights with erratic movement for 30 minutes before disappearing. It is extremely too late to report this sighting, but I just had to.  I do not remember the day but, it was in 2002 mid-summer Glendale Arizona.  I finished shopping at the Fry’s Grocery store at 51st. Ave/ Olive.  I lived at 51st. Ave. and Bell Ave. which is a straight shot north to home.  I owned a black jeep wrangler at the time which I had the top off.  A beautiful day, I noticed lights through the upper part of my windshield.  There were three, round lights. I watched them as I continued home.  They moved in all directions and at times disappeared and reappeared.  Up/ down, come together and separate. I must of watched them for 20-30 minutes.  When I pulled in my driveway I rushed in to get my binoculars and was unable to find them.  I ran out to see if they were still there and they were. I ran to the neighbors to have them look too but, no one was home.  I am really sad to this day that I was unable to share/ witness this.  The lights retreated up as far as I could tell and vanished by light or by distance it was hard to tell. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

More Phoenix Lights;2005-09-13 16:47:00;5 minutes;More Phoenix Lights My wife and I saw and filmed 4 very bright amber/yellow lights that were moving very slow to the south of our location. We are investigators for I.C.A.R.(International Community for Alien Research) and we were doing a follow-up on a sighting report that someone else had made when we saw these lights. The objects we saw were under 1500 feet in altitude. They did not change altitude or move side-to-side. There was no sound that we could perceive from the objects and there were no blinking or flashing lights that you would associate with any conventional aircraft. The lights moved slowly to the south and then went out one at a time. There was a family of 5 who had pulled over along the road near us and they spoke with us after these lights went out, asking us if we had seen the lights too. Being a trained investigator I am VERY familiar with the types of aircraft that are seen in this area and I have never seen any lights like this in the sky before.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

Light dropping other lights;2005-12-29 03:27:00;20 to 30 seconds;Light dropping other lights I was on my way to work and had stopped to get some gas. When leaving the gas station I noticed a bright amber/yellow light due east of me heading to the east.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness meant west.  Please see note below.  PD)) There were no blinking or marker lights as would be seen on a conventional aircraft. The object would brighten briefly and then in the air below the object, an identical amber light would appear and descend toward the ground then fade out. This was repeated several times as the main object kept heading away from me on a straight and level course. One of the objects that appeared below the main object, descended and then made a right angle turn and moved north before fading out. It was hard to estimate altitude on this object but I would guess it was below 5,000 feet. The main object continued to head east until it faded out of view. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, I filed a report of a sighting in Glendale, Arizona with you on Thursday, December 29, 2005 at 22:37:21. I had the sighting around 3:30am and did not fill out the report until late that evening. I had worked a 10 hour shift that day and was quite tired when I filled out the report. I hope you post the report when you update your data base but, I made a mistake on it that I was hoping you would correct as I want the report to be accurate. Because I was so tired when I filled out the report I got the direction of the sighting backwards. The object(s) I saw were moving WEST and not east as I stated in the report. Thank you,   ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Strange lights over Glendale, Arizona.;2009-01-09 22:00:00;2 minutes;Strange lights over Glendale, Arizona. Three bright lights were heading North when they suddenly changed direction and turned back South in a matter of a second.  The lights continued to move at an increasing pace, now heading West.   We had tried to keep up in an automobile for as long as we could, but the lights had shot out and extended far West at an incredible rate until they could no longer be seen. P.S.--I tried to call the telephone line and I was only welcomed with a rude response that I was creating a hoax.  I feel as though I was discriminated against for being so open about my experience. ((NUFORC Note:  We apologize to the source of the report, if, in fact, it is a serious report.  However, we received his telephone call amidst a number of other calls from the same area code at about the same time our Hotline received a number of other calls from rude, impudent, foul-mouthed youth, who apparently placed calls to hoax and pester our Center.

Two lights moving in multiple directions with a sparkling trail behind them that disappeared when they'd stop and then reappear.;2010-10-23 19:25:00;6 minutes;Two lights moving in multiple directions with a sparkling trail behind them that disappeared when they'd stop and then reappear. My girlfriend and I were leaving a local store in Glendale, AZ  just before 7:30 PM on 10/23/10, and while we were walking to the car we both noticed a single light that resembled a very close meteor. The first light had a tail behind it that disappeared when the light remained still. Within seconds another light was visible directly next to the first.	 	The two lights began to move in the same direction at about a 55 degree angle to the N/NW of where we were standing, and both had tails behind them at that point. They were moving up and to my right,  immediately changing to separate directions, and began to move downward, then continued to move in multiple directions. (one would spiral down while the other would zip in the opposite direction and vice versa) 	Multiple times both lights would look as if they had burned out or moved behind clouds and then reappear just as brightly as before. This lasted for about 5 minutes, then it seemed they were too low to see from where we were. The lights were very bright (almost white) and the tails were similar to sparks. The shape was round or possibly oval. There were also two other women in the parking lot that observed the entire occurrence, but I didn’t get their names.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Green light streaked across the sky at a low level and then disappeared;2011-01-18 19:30:00;4 to 5 seconds;Green light streaked across the sky at a low level and then disappeared My daugther and I were sitting at my older daughters soccer game, when I looked up and saw a light streak across the sky and then disappear. I started to make a wish thinking it was just a falling star, but then realized it was much to low for that and it went in more of a vertical direction and was green in color. The light appeared to be just above the school gymnasium rather then high in the sky like you would see with a falling star.  I then said something to my daughter sitting next to me and she said wow, you saw that too!  I wasn't going to say anything because I just thought that was my imagination.   Once we were home from the game and we were eating dinner my younger daughter and I started talking about it and that's when my older daughter spoke up and said You saw that too?! I just happened to look up in the sky when I was out on the soccer field and saw this green light fly across the sky above the gymnasium and then disappear.   I find that inte! resting because we had not said anything about it being green or right above the gymnasium, so it appears that she saw the same thing that we did.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

Red bright orbs flying in formation then three flew past us climbing up into the night!;2013-02-23 19:45:00;10  minutes;Red bright orbs flying in formation then three flew past us climbing up into the night! while driving down the 101 west just before 51st ave in Glendale we initially saw 10-12 bright red orbs hovering in a formation of the big dipper.   We wanted to get closer so we exited 51st and drove back towards the lights on the frontage road.  The lights began to disappear higher into the sky till there were none left.   We turned on 35th ave and saw another one moving past us at a high altitude.   We then pulled into a driveway that went into a open desert area and one came from the tree line heading towards us.  As it got closer it began climbing higher and was straight ahead of us and stopped.   From the same tree line a second ball of red light that had a cone of light shining from the top of the ball began to follow the first.   Once the second ball got closer to the first the first one began to take off again heading away from us and climbing higher into the night.   As the second ball followed the first ones path turning away from us a THIRD one began to fly towards us from the same tree line.  This one seemed closer and even bigger.  It turned away in a large turn and quickly sped behind the other two.   All three got to such an altitude that they disappeared.    Someone else had to see these flying they were right next to the highway! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

This evening my mother and I were on the front patio talking, when very high in the sky I noticed a small, far away, bright light.  It looked like a star but extremely bright, yet the sun had not set yet.  I was shocked it was so bright.   Then it started to move down, to us it seemed as though it was moving slowly, but it appeared to be quite far away so it could've been quickly.  As it moved downward it faded slowly until it completely disappeared.   There were no clouds in the area for it to disappear into.  We watched it until it got so dim we could no longer see it.   I yelled for my husband and by the time he came outside it was too dim for him to see.  We stayed out there about another 10 minutes.  All of a sudden, my husband was yelling, Holy crap there it is!!!  I looked up in the same spot and sure enough there it was.  So extremely bright and fading as it slowly moved downward.  It appeared to be very very high in the sky.   I am not sure if this was a UFO or something else, but I came upon this site when searching for other possible similar sightings.  I thought I would share my experience in case others had or will have the same!  Thanks much!;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

Two of us witnessed at least two dozen orange lights traveling from N to SW at a 40 degree angle to the horizon. The first bunch came in then some trailed behind then a few more in a bunch then more trailed in in a snake like pattern.  They were not floating like lanterns and were not drones. No blinking.  All of them disappeared at the same western spot.  We couldn't tell if they flew into a cloud because it wasn't a totally clear night. There was no noise.  They flew slowly like a helicopter would fly. We live north of LUKE AFB and are familiar with the F16's, 18's and 35's.  We also see and hear passenger jets approach Sky Harbor and smaller craft that use two smaller airports. I phoned LUKE AFB and they did not have any helicopter squadron maneuver.
