I saw a UFO;2000-10-08 22:30:00;15-20minutes;I saw a UFO I WENT OUTSIDE AT EXACTLY 10:30 PM, SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR AT A TABLE LOOKING OUT THE BACKYARD FACING SOUTH.SOMETHING FROM THE RIGHT SIDE CAUGHT MY EYE, AND AS I STUDIED IT...I OBSERVED A CIRCLE/OVAL TYPE OBJECT WITH APPROXIMATELY 3-4 RED LIGHTS. IT WAS VERY CLOUDY THAT NIGHT, BUT THERE WERE BIG BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS, AND THIS BEAUTIFUL OBJECT DANCED AROUND FOR ME, VERY GRACEFULLY SITTING IN THE SKY, AND THEN EFFORTLESSLY, MOVING IN ABSOLUTELY EVERY DIRECTION, SILENTLY, AND AT TIMES, SUPER FAST. THIS ALL TOOK PLACE FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, WHEN I RAN INSIDE THE HOUSE AND AWOKE MY GIRLFRIEND, AND TOLD HER TO GET THE F*@K OUT HERE RIGHT NOW. AND CHECK OUT THIS UFO!! SHE PUT HER GLASSES ON AND WATCHED WITH ME FOR A COUPLE MORE MINUTES, WHEN I RAN BACK INSIDE, GRABBED MY MOBILE PHONE, LOOKED UP THE KSAZ CHANNEL 10 PHONE NUMBER, DIALED IT, RAN BACK OUTSIDE AND CONTINUED TO WATCH THE UFO. MY GIRLFRIEND ALSO GRABBED THE CAMERA AND STARTED SHOOTING PICTURES. I HAVEN'T DEVELOPED THEM YET, BUT I WILL AND EMAIL THEM TO YOU. THAT IS, IF THEY COME OUT O.K. ANYWAY, THE PHONE RANG FOR FIVE MINUTES OR SO AND I GAVE UP. WE JUST SAT THERE FOR ANOTHER 10 MINUTES. AS I LOOKED AT THIS (BY THE WAY, I WAS LOOKING IN A WESTERNLY DIRECTION) I OBSERVED SOME STARS, RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING THAT, LOOKED AT A FEW COMMERCIAL PLANES...NOT THAT, NO REFLECTION OF SOMETHING, NO WEATHER BALLOON. I HAVE WATCHED THE SKIES FOR AS LONG I HAVE BEEN ALIVE, THIS WAS A GENUINE HIT. EVERYTHING I HAVE SEEN ON T.V. THAT SHOWS WHAT WERE BELIEVED REAL ONES. THIS FIT THAT DESCRIPTION. IT WAS UN-REAL, AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. MY GIRLFRIEND WAS AWED. SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE. THE WHOLE TIME WE WATCHED, THERE WERE PLANES FLYING BY, AND IT JUST SAT RIGHT WHERE IT STARTED, JUST MOVING ALL AROUND. AT ONE TIME, WE LOST VIEW OF IT, BUT ANOTHER BREAK IN THE CLOUDS, AND ANOTHER SHOW FOR US!! AND THEN, AFTER A BIG SOLID CLOUD ROLLED OVER, IT DISAPPEARED. MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WENT BACK TO BED, TALKED FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES,! TRIPPED OUT AND CRASHED. I HAD ALSO CALLED MY BROTHER, BUT HE COULDN'T SEE IT, AND IT WAS RAINING VERY HEAVY BY HIM.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
UFO Sighting - Glendale, AZ;2001-11-05 21:25:00;5 to 6 Sec.;UFO Sighting - Glendale, AZ Hello, I'm from Glendale, AZ.  Its about 9:43pm right now and I just witnessed the best thing ever.  At approximately 9:25pm, this evening, I saw, what appeared to me as a UFO.  I have never seen one before only read about them on different sites.  However, the object I saw was lower than most aircraft in the area and was shooting across the sky at a very rapid rate, much faster than the aircraft here.  The object was round, the bottom looked like a reddish gold color, no lights and no sound.  I ran downstairs, from my apartment, went to the parking lot, not 3 to 4 seconds later and the object was gone.  I've had many mixed feelings until now.  Now I have become a believer.  I thought you would like to know my story, I'm very excited about the entire event and wanted to share this extraordinary night. Thank you for your time. GLendale, AZ;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Lighted object  vaporized in a cloud of fog before my eyes.;2002-03-15 19:15:00;1 minute;((NUFORC Note:  Report of missile launch from Vandenberg AFB.  PD)) Lighted object  vaporized in a cloud of fog before my eyes. We saw a light like an airplane coming toward us.  It had what looked like fog all around it with a light aiming toward the ground.  Suddenly it looked like it was getting covered with a big cloud of fog, then the fog began to clear and the light was completely gone.  The light didn't go off in any direction.  It seemed to vaporize.  Then the fog cloud disappeared.  If there was any sound we were too far away to hear it.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Red cirlular object over the sky in Glendale,Arizona, October 30, 2004.;2004-10-30 22:35:00;5-8 mnutes;Red cirlular object over the sky in Glendale, Arizona, October 30, 2004. I was sitting out in my front yard with my fiance' and nephew and happened to see a red object going about the speed of a jet, heading from south to north.  It abrubtly stopped. I told my sister, her husband and my niece to come out and watch this with us, at this time it was near the belt of Orion.  It then started to move north once again but very very slowly.  It stopped again and a few seconds later, it looked like the bottom exploded and a round red object came out, then it did it again and another red object came out and then it did it again and another red object came out. They circled the first object and then they all disappeared.  We did watch to see if there would be a report on this, and also have asked several other people if they saw it.  Who do we contact when we see things like this?;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
large clear ball shaped orb  in Glendale..  day time sighting;2009-02-14 11:00:00;3 mins;large clear ball shaped orb  in Glendale..  day time sighting In my back yard facing West at 11 am..  I saw out of the corner of my eye a large , white, clear ball shaped unknown object. It moved VERY fast from the South behind me and stopped in the North East sky and hovard for about 30 seconds. I have never seen anything like it.. It was almost clear. Like looking at a mirage or a jellyfish, but in a perfect ball.  It then sped up going East for a few miles then turned West and shot off  ..  It was not a balloon..  I saw another report  from Queen Creek Az.. 25 mins before this I did see a strange flat , black  helicopter going Northwest- Right where the orb shot off to.. I took photos but they were to fuzzy. I found it interesting that two people from across the valley see the same weird object. I felt like it was observing me.. It moved almost like a hummingbird does.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
small lights (20) traveling across the sky in formation out of the SW sky to the NE over AZ.  ((Starlink satellites?));2014-03-22 20:00:00;20 minutes;small lights (20) traveling across the sky in formation out of the SW sky to the NE over AZ I looked up at Venus and noticed what i thought was a satellite moving to the northeast, but then there was another , and another and another. I ran and got my son and we went out to the front of our house. They kept coming seemingly from a 'bald spot' in the sky next to Venus.  I'd say 20+/-. Traveling same direction in a line, spaced somewhat the same distance apart. some were closer together , and one or two didnt follow in the line here in there.  A plane flew by so I had a comparison and these were VERY VERY small like a star or how a satellite or space station looks going across the nite sky. I hope to learn others saw them too.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
