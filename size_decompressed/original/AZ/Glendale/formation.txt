We live on a mountains;2004-06-14 20:40:00;5 minutes;While putting the kids to bed, my wife pointed out very bright and unusual lights in formation to the sothwest.  We live on a mountainside and had a good view of thses lights for 5 minutes, 2.5 of which I have on video tape.  These lights were almost stationary and in formation this did not change.  Brightness of each was Venus maggnitude or brighter.  Lights seemed to flash in a pattern.  While my eyes said they were red and white, video shows green yellow and orange as well.  As the lights went from sight, a movement to NE seemed to take place.  I am an experienced sky watcher and this was not an ordinary occurance.  Size was a minimm of 600 ft and at the most 3000=4000 by my estimates. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a photography specialist, and captured several minutes of high-quality video of the light display.  We do not know what the object was, but the event is under investigation.  PD));33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

Orange lights spotted in the northwestern sky either on a large aircraft or five small aircrafts in formation.;2014-11-18 20:00:00;20 minutes;Orange lights spotted in the northwestern sky either on a large aircraft or five small aircrafts in formation. I was turning out of my college parking lot headed west onto Happy Valley road and in the sky approximately 2000-4000 feet in the sky I could see five orange lights fairly close together.  The orange is a very unique orange and is similar to single lights I've seen hovering in the sky in the past.   I was driving so my view was constantly being obstructed but i got three very good looks at this object.  It would fade out of view like a light bulb being turned off and was only lit or visible for a few seconds at a time.   It was either five lights in a line or 5 lights fixed onto a round craft.   I could not quite make out the shape.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Cluster of approximately  20 bright white blinking lights traveled slowly in a westerly direction  over glendale AZ 1:30 am;2015-06-07 01:32:00;30 minutes;Cluster of approximately  20 bright white blinking lights traveled slowly in a westerly direction  over Glendale, AZ, 1:30 am. At approximately 1:30 am, my boyfriend was out back with the pups and asked me to come outside to see what he had been watching for a couple minutes in the West sky.  There was this cluster of 20 bright crisp silvery metallic white lights in a loose grouping.  The angle we were looking up into the sky was 30 degrees.   The lights appeared to have a pattern they were blinking off and on through but neither of us could tell you specifically what it was.  This grouping of lights, for lack of a better description, moved in a westerly direction as if attached to a drunken butterfly.  Slowly, left, right, forward, stationary, rinse, repeat.    Although the lights were moving farther west and away from us, they were still very bright white.....not soft or amber but clear bright white. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with both witnesses, and both appeared on a radio program.  They were both very objective, and sober-minded, in describing the event, and we suspect that both of them are quite reliable, and capable, witnesses.  PD));33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
3 lights spotted in line over Phoenix.;2016-11-10 19:00:00;20 minutes;3 lights spotted in line over phoenix We noticed three lights in an imperfect line moving nortwest.  The lights seem to be blinking independently of each other.  No apparent pattern in blinking either.  It appeared that every couple of minutes to drop something but it could have been the way the light on the bottom blinked.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
White lights in a formation traveling slowly/silently over NW Glendale, AZ, then disappeared after sighting.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-04 21:20:00;40 seconds;White lights in a formation traveling slowly/silently over NW Glendale, AZ then disappeared after sighting Witnessed seven large circular lights moving eastward very slowly over the sky at Utopia & 68th Ave in Glendale, AZ, approximately 9:20 PM (AZ time zone) on the night of Saturday, November 4th, 2017.  We the lights them for approximately a 45-second duration before they disappeared.  Could easily tell they were not airplanes- there was no noise and they did not look like airplanes that flew by in same spot after they disappeared.  We live under a flight path, so definitely would know if lights were from airplanes.  These were not airplanes!  They seemed to make somewhat of a V formation.   We took two photos and one short video that caught they tail end of the sighting.  Only 3 to 4 lights appear in the photos but visible to our eyes there were approximately seven.  The light pattern moved slowly, silently, and lights were all in unison with each other as if belonging to one large flying or several that were somehow traveling in a geometric formation at the same speed and altitude.  The formation appeared similar to a V, but was not a perfect V showing all the points.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
