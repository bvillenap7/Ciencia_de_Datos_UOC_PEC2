2 eggshaped objects over Glendale Az. near stadium.;2009-10-11 12:30:00;20 minutes;2 eggshaped objects over Glendale Az. near stadium. 	I was in my front yard with my girlfriends 2 grandchildren Vanessa and Stephanie. We were setting up a Halloween display in the yard. Above us circling around the area was a blimp. Not an uncommon sight, we live close to the stadium where the Cardinals play. It was there filming for the Cardinals football game. Which reminded me we must finish up so I don’t miss any of the game. I told the girls “wave” to the blimp. It was at that point I noticed a white object above the blimp. Vanessa saw it too. It was just sitting there not moving. I asked Stephanie to get my binoculars. We watched this white egg shaped object for maybe 5 minutes when all of a sudden as I have the object in view, a dark object fly’s up right next to the white one. They are just sitting there together for about 2 minutes then the dark one speeds off to the south. They were both the same size ,same shape just different color. We turned our attention back to the white one which had moved to another area in the sky. At one point it looked as though it was close to the flight path of planes. I remember thinking to myself “The guys driving that blimp could have seen this object, or the pilots of the planes”. Altogether we watched this for about 20 minutes total till the object vanished.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
