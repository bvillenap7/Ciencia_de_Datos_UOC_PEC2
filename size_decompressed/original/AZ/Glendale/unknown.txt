A light seen traveling through the sky at high altitue at a very high speed before dissappearing;2010-06-28 00:10:00;1 second;A light seen traveling through the sky at high altitue at a very high speed before dissappearing I am a member of the U.S. Air Force and the sighting occured on Luke AFB.  Shortly after exiting a building, a motion in the sky in front of me caught my attention.  I looked up to see a light which appeared to be very high moving very fast.  I was facing south and the the object was visible above a building in front of me, moving south as well.   Because of the distance the object appeared very small, and was indiscernable as anything other than a single bright blue light.  The best discription i can give is that it looked excactly like a meteor, and in fact at first i thought that was what i had seen.  The difference was that this object had no tail associated with meteors i have seen in the past, and it zig-zagged, darting both to the right and left before dissappearing.  It was only visible for just over a second.   I work with aircraft every day and am used to seeing them at night both civilian and military, this was not like anything i have seen before.

UFO sighting over Glendale, AZ, on 9/28/2013 (150 orange objects).  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from ret. AZ Hwy. Patrol officer.  PD));2013-09-28 19:15:00;5 minutes;UFO sighting over Glendale, AZ, on 9/28/2013 (150 Orange objects) I am a retired state police officer from the state of Arizona after nearly 35 years of service.  I live in north Glendale, north of the Loop 101 highway in the area of  67th avenue. At approximately 7:15 pm, I happened to glance out my kitchen window that faces north, and I observed some bright orange lights traveling from the west to east.  It seemed unusual, so I went out into my back yard to investigate further.   At that time I observed multiple bright orange objects coming from what appeared to be the Lake Pleasant area which is approximately 15-20 miles northwest of my home.  They were traveling from the west to the east.   In my mind, I immediately thought these appeared to be Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO’s).  I immediately thought to myself, “If I don’t get pictures, nobody is going to believe me.”  I re-entered my home and got my I phone and started to take pictures.   The objects were being partially blocked by some trees on the golf course so I decided to go out on the golf course where I could obtain non-obstructed pictures.   I have a great interest in UFO’s and have done a fair amount of reading up on them and was convinced the probability was high that these were in fact UFO’s. I filmed these objects for probably over 5 minutes.  At one point my video stopped and I had to restart it again.  I was in awe because they just keep coming.  I would estimate as many as 150 of these orange objects.   It’s hard to estimate their speed.  They were not going as fast as a military jet and they were not stopped.  They seemed to maintain a constant speed that I would have to estimate at 150-200 mph.  I did not see any particular formation.  There would be 5-7 of them traveling together and others following behind in a line.   It appeared to me that when I first saw them coming from the Lake Pleasant area, that as they came higher they were trying to catch up to those ahead.  They maintained a constant orange glow with no flickering.  I observed no other lights on them, just the orange glow. I know that the Phoenix area had reports of a meteor last night.  This was not a meteor.  A meteor travels so fast that if you blink, you may well miss it.  Meteors are generally a white flash of light or fire looking and these objects were bright orange in color and had a controlled speed far less than a meteor.   This was not a weather balloon as the government might claim.  There were approximately 150 of them and they were rising at a speed inconsistent with a weather balloon.  These were not Chinese candles (candle lit objects that rise from the heat of the candle).  The objects were much too fast to be Chinese candles.   These were not military flares as some might think.  They were rising, not falling, as flares do after being shot into the air or falling after being dropped. Once again these objects were traveling from west to east at approximately 150-200 mph and as they passed just slightly east of my home they seemed to just disappear.   This parade continued for over 5 minutes.  As some would disappear, others would appear from the lake area. When all were gone, I went back into my house to call family to tell them what I had seen. Like most people out there some were believers and others had their doubts.  I thought “but I have video proof”, and when I went to view the pictures, nothing was visible, just a black screen.   I know what I saw and unless someone has a better explanation, I feel that I was fortunate enough to see what many of us hope to see someday and will not.   I have absolutely no reason to make false claims or file false reports. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be exceptionally objective and sober-minded, in describing his sighting.  We suspect that he is an exceptionally reliable and capable witness.  PD));33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Black Helicopter;2014-10-10 21:00:00;2 minutes;Black Helicopter As I was sitting in my living room, enjoying my free time - my wife was across the street at her girlfriends house - a very low flying helicopter flew over the house.  It was so low that the house shook.   I rushed out side to try to catch a glimpse of this helicopter and to report it to the FAA. I was in for a huge surprise.  It sounded to me as if it flew a short distance away and then came racing back towards me as if it was a bat out of hell!!   This happened more than a few times.  At one time it seemed to stop over the house and hover there trying to intimidate me.  As crazy as this sounds, I could not see it.  There seemed to be some roter wash, but the noise that the copter was making was almost deafening and the house seemed to be shaking so hard that it was going to fall apart.  And yet I still could not see any nav lights or it.   It finally left after a few moments and has not been back since then.   No neighbors came out to investigate the racket and my wife did not hear it across the street. A interesting side note is this:  I happened to look straight up and saw at about 10,000- 15,000 ft a red orb circling directly in what appeared to be over my house. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
