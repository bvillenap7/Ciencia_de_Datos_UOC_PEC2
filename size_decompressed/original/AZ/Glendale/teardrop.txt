Silent black tear-drop shaped craft going above mach speed.;2004-09-04 09:00:00;10-12 seconds;Silent black tear-drop shaped craft going above mach speed. Object was to the east of me when I spotted it. It was about 4 to 5 miles away between 500 to 800 feet off the ground. The object was traveling due north. This object was black, had no markings, no blinking lights, no propellers or rotors, and no hanging jet engine pods. The object also had NO wings or any tail surfaces that I could see. The object travel beyond my line of sight(estimated to be 50 to 60 miles visibility or more)in between 10 to 12 seconds. That should have put the objects speed well above Mach and it made NO sound and there was NO sonic boom. The object did not leave any kind of contrail either.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
