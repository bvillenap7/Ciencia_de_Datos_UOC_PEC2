Fireball on the top of  mountain behind Luke Air Force Base, AZ.;1997-03-13 22:00:00;2 hours;Fireball on the top of  mountain behind Luke Air Force Base, AZ It was around 10pm and my husband ran through the front door almost paralyzed w/ fear.  He ran down the hallway and I followed asking him to please tell me what was wrong.  He initially said, I can't tell you and I'll never tell anyone.    I kept at him and he suddenly grabbed me by the arm took me out the front door pointed up to the top of the tall hills on the back side of Luke Airforce base and said, That's whats wrong.   He then ran back into the house.   I stood there focused on what appeared to be a glowing fireball on the very top of the mountain.  I watched it for a while then yelled to my husband that I was going to take the truck and go up there, as it looked like a crashed craft of some sort.  He became hysterical and said, no way.   I then saw jets being scrambled from Luke AFB and a few minutes later I could see headlights from vehicles climbing the mountain trying to get to the fireball.  The road back there is part of the Base, so I assumed they were Base security climbing the mountain.  They only got about half way up the mountain and either stopped or shut off their headlights.   I went back in the house and tried to call local news (perhaps channel 10?).  There was a busy signal, which I thought was odd for a news station.  I managed to calm my husband down enough to tell me exactly what had happened to him while he was on his way home from his meeting and he put his hands on his head and said, that he was on his way home and came to a stop because the man in front of him had stopped suddenly.   You have to understand this is out in a very sparse desert area where it is pitch black w/ no street lights.  He had his window down and then a huge object floated over his car and the man in front of him.  The man in front of him also had his head out of the window.   My husband said there was no sound at all, but it blacked out the stars above seeming like it took an eternity to pass directly over the two idling vehicles.  My husband said, he yelled at the man in front of him a! fter the object finally passed over and said, You saw that right?  He said, the man said yes, but would never tell anyone that he did.   My husband said, the huge object floated rising slowly and went to the top of the mountain just on the back side of the base and that's when he had run into the house and into the back bedroom, completely ridden w/ fear. So, I can only report the fireball that I witnessed that I thought looked like a crashed craft as it completely lit the top of the mountain. But the whole story needed to be told, as my husband has NEVER been the same.  It shook him to his very core and would refuse to talk about it as it brought back the intense fear. After a while the fireball on top of the mountain slowly began to fade, but remained glowing for about two hours.  I get angry at myself for not taking the truck up there to see for myself, but it's very rugged terrain to get up there even w/ a dirt road or a fire road on which to travel.   It has taken me this long to tell this eye witness account, but now it is told.  By the way, I went to the front of the Air Force Base (about 3 blocks away)  the next day and it was locked down tight.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429

I video taped the red UFO for this time for about 10min. This time I caught a shot of the thing that was better than the night before. It was a red UFO over the city, and then it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  This witness is experienced in photographing anomalous events, and works with another party in Glendale.

i saw what appeared to be a meteor traveling east to west. it seemed extremely large, and frightfully close;2003-02-20 18:30:00;2 sec.;i was traveling north on 51st ave. between olive ave. and peoria ave. when i saw what appeared to be a meteor traveling east to west. it seemed extremely large, and frightfully close. though i was traveling at about 50 mph. in moderate traffic, i managed to watch it descend all the way until it seemed to extinguish at about 5,000 feet i would guess. it was so close that i flexed my muscles waiting for the jarring impact, but there was none. i'm no expert, but i hardly believe that something that large could have burnt up, or disintegrated that quick before it hit. it was big enough that i expected to feel a jolt much larger than any earthquake. i only decided to report this when i read the report already posted for that day, because even though i don't remember the exact date, it had to be the same object that was reported by the guy driving down 43rd ave. i can't believe that only one other person saw it, i was sure that hundreds of people at least would have seen it. and wouldn't have been one bit suprised if it was mentioned on the news.

Rather large UFO falls to earth in a ball of fire over Southwest US;2009-05-24 23:35:00;3 Seconds;Rather large UFO falls to earth in a ball of fire over Southwest US While sitting on porch witnessed a fireball, enter our atmosphere and fall.  Must have been quite large metior or whatever, because the fireball was quite bright and large.  It burned bright green and orange and then dimmed for a brief second. and then got really bright again.  About half way down object stopped buring as it fell to earth.  Now I have seen shooting stars, but this item was so large and bright I was concerned it was a missle at first.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
3/18/11 7:35 P.M Glendale, AZ Fireball falling from sky turns into 6 large glowing lights.;2011-03-18 19:35:00;4 minutes;3/18/11 7:35 P.M Glendale, AZ Fireball falling from sky turns into 6 large glowing lights. March 18, 2011 Glendale, AZ 7:35 P.M  I was driving home from work and saw a light falling from the sky.  I turned onto Frier DR and 67th Ave in Glendale, AZ at 7:35 P.M when I noticed a light falling from the sky.  I stopped and got out of the car.  It looked like a single Firework falling from the sky instead of going up in the sky.  It was falling from the sky at a fast pace.  It then split into 2 falling “Fireworks” and continued to fall from the sky at a fast pace.  From the speed it was falling from the sky, I figured it was a meteorite.  All of a sudden both falling lights ran into each other and formed 1 falling “Firework”.  It then stopped and formed 5-6 steady lights that just stopped and stayed in one place.  The lights were not in a straight line.  I then started driving towards the objects in the sky.  It felt like I was getting closer to the objects and I thought I was about to see one of the lights up close but some trees got in the way.  By the time I got by the trees it was gone. I have no idea how far away I was from the initial sighting and how high in the sky it was.  From what I saw it lasted about 4 minutes.  There is an Air force base around the area of where the lights where coming from.  From where I was at, at the time of the sighting, I'd say I was about 10 miles from the Air force base.  The steady lights that I saw were big.  It was not an airplane. I was so curious and so quick to pick up the phone that I don’t remember if I saw 5-6 or 7 lights.  Like I said I thought it was a meteorite at first and didn’t think I needed to video tape it.  And I thought that my mind was playing tricks on me after seeing that horrible movie Battle Los Angles.  But I know what I saw and it was defiantly strange looking.  The speed that these lights were falling at and then to just stop and turn into steady glowing lights and sit in the sky was amazing.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Bright orange sphere that turned into a star in less than a second.;2012-12-31 21:00:00;2 minutes;bright orange sphere that turned into a star in less than a second On New Years Eve around 9pm I and 3 friends were having dinner outside. I was seated facing west and looked up to the sky and noticed a bright orange/red circle of light.  Immediately I stood up and said, Hey, what is that? There were no navigation lights visible, no strobe flashing and was very close to Luke air force base which is about 6 miles west of our location. It appeared to cut to the south briefly then north all while moving east directly towards us.  No sound could be heard and it stayed a constant glow.   Just short of being directly overhead of us it stopped and hovered for about 5 seconds then turned into an incredibly bright white light, and shot straight up and appeared to be a star in a matter of a split second then faded out of sight.   It was too high to begin with to be any type of fireworks not to mention traveling horizontally for too great a distance. this was not any type of Aircraft that we are familiar with.   Later that same evening, it was witnessed again by 2 other friends and was described exactly the same, as turning into a star.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
Fireball-like objects above ASU West.;2013-10-26 18:00:00;10 minute;Fireball-like objects above ASU West. On 10/26/13, my mom and I were just leaving the Starbucks on 43rd Ave and Thunderbird.   While waiting to turn on the main street, hovering directly above ASU West campus, we noticed 5 flame orange/ red orbs horizontally aligned not moving at all.   We proceeded across the street to the campus for a better look and these orbs started changing colors between red and orange.   These objects were flying too close together to be any kind of commercial or military craft.   They began to ascend and fly toward the east, eventually we lost sight of those five.  Then, we saw another orange orb that seemed to be catching up with the others.   As I took a picture of it from my truck, it was as if the flash from my phone caught its attention and it stopped in mid-flight for about 5 seconds, then began flying again toward the eastern sky.;33.5847292857143;-112.190183571429
