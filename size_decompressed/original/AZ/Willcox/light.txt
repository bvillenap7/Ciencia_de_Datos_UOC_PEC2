A bit past 2100hrs, 5 May 2021, lasted approx. 20 min.  A series of lights appearing in a line from 10:00 traveling to 2:00 o'clock position across North Star.  20 degrees above the horizon.  The lights appeared in a black section of the sky traveling to the NE in a line very evenly spaced, slow speed, single file, to the 2 o'clock position where they each disappeared one at a time - as they had appeared - in a black section of the sky.  Each was visible for 15 seconds, 10 to 12 visible at any one time and this lasted for about 15 minutes.  As they reached the center of their travel distance they brightened and a cone of light pointed in our direction brightened for 1 or 2 seconds.  Then became the point of light they were at the beginning and end.  When looking at those coming into view the distance they were visible at the other end was extended about 3 or 4 objects/lights.  Looking directly at them the fainter points were lost.  There was no sound.  Brigh! t white point of light in each case.;32.369359375;-109.861915625
