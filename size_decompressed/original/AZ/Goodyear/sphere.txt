Seven orange/red lights moving slowly and / or hovering.;2014-01-01 00:24:00;3 minutes;Seven orange / red lights moving slowly and / or hovering My family and I were watching fireworks in our neighborhood about 20 minutes after midnight on New Years.  We looked to the north and there were 7 orange/red lights in the sky.  They were moving slowly and some we're hovering.   The lights slowly disappeared as if moving away.  They were replaced by new lights.  This went on for about 3-4 minutes.  The lights looked like very bright red orange stars.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
