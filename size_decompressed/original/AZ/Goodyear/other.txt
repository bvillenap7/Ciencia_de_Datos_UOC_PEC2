Five white objects moving from side to side during the daylight.;2001-08-29 13:30:00;20 min;Five white objects moving from side to side during the daylight. The objects were flat with turned up edges, they almost looked like paper floating from side to side in the sky. During the afternoon the were very brilliant, and almost looked as bright as stars on a dark evening. they moved quickly, and finally shot stright into the air out of sight.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
Near Earth object observed passing by at high speed.;2014-05-15 22:06:00;8 seconds;Near Earth object observed passing by at high speed. I believe it to be a very large asteriod passing from West to East.  It first looked like a plastic grocery bag twisting in the breeze, however there was no breeze.  The object showed an irregular shape and seemed to be tumbling slowly as it passed.   I realized it was not near to me when I noticed it was passing into the Earth's shadow.   It was travelling very fast, much faster than the ISS speed of 17,500 mph.  My estimate would be 3 or 4 times that rate.   The object never grazed the atmosphere, it just proceeded on its trajectory.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
Bright, amber, 5 of them, 2 remain after 30 seconds.;2017-02-14 00:00:00;5-8 minutes;Bright, amber, 5 of them, 2 remain after 30 seconds. They were very bright!  Too bright to be a plane or a flare.  No trail behind it.  And I would think that the flares would be in a formation.  But they were in a odd formation.  I heard no planes either.   I went to get my brother, and when I came back, there were only 2 left, but there was 4 of them.  I have video proof.  And I have a picture I made to explain it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
