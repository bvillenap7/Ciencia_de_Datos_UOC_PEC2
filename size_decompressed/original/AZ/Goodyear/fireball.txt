Strrange Fireball over Goodyear Arizona;2007-03-23 00:00:00;5 minutes;Strrange Fireball over Goodyear Arizona We witnessed a large strange fireball circling in the northern sky of Goodyear,  Arizona, at eight in the evening.  A total of five people witnessed this strange fireball which also had a long tail.  The fireball circled the northern sky about two times.  My family and I thought that the strange fireball was possibly an airliner that was on fire.  The fireball then disappeared into the northern sky heading east.  The fireball could be seen for about five minutes.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
Large White Fireball disappears behind Estrella mountains;2011-11-23 21:35:00;5 Minutes;Large White Fireball disappears behind Estrella mountains I was sitting on my balcony tonight, talking on the phone when I noticed a large white ball type of light that appeared closer than the planes flying towards Skyharbor airport.  There are a lot of stars out tonight, but this was closer.  The light caught my eye because of its size and it was pulsating, then out of nowhere, it fell straight down until it disappeared behind the Estrella mountain range.   When it was falling it looked like a white fireball with a fat white tail, not that of a shooting star that arcs with a thin tail.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
Orange Lights over Buckeye/Goodyear Arizona;2013-07-29 21:30:00;23:30;Orange Lights over Buckeye/Goodyear Arizona Watching the ball of light like every week, Monday to Thursday, out here at work on the loop 303 between Peoria ave and northern ave between 21:00/23:30.  Nice display of craft tonight. 5 in a triangle shape with an open lower end like a upside down V.  In the buckeye area.  The other crafts were in a straight line, 3 across, over the Goodyear area.  The outer ones flew lower and higher around the middle craft. Just a real good showing and long flight time tonight.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
A constant orange firey light traveling a few hundred miles per hour toward Phoenix and then diverted.;2013-10-19 20:30:00;3 minutes;A constante orange firey light traveling a few hundred miles per hour toward Phoenix and then diverted A firey orange glowing object, round in shape, came from the southwest (Gila Bend) toward the north east (Goodyear) and then diverted as it came closer (toward Phoenix) and then traveled southeast (toward Tucson).   It was traveling probably at least 500 feet up in the air, maximum 1500 (hard to tell at night) but is was large and bright and did not flash at all, just a constant fire orange glow, no other lights, no other colors, no discernable shape other than that of the light.  It did not make any sounds.   There were jets in the night sky that were clear and easy to pick apart from this object.  It had to be traveling at about 200 miles per hour.   As it traveled to the southeast it dissapeared, went completeley black.   I have been in the military, been in law enforcement for over 20 years and I have never seen such a light.

Large orange ball, with tail, moved across sky, getting smaller as it moved.

Fireball.;2016-04-01 19:30:00;45 seconds;Was heading North this evening with my wife and son shortly after sundown, when we noticed a fireball at about 45 degrees in the direction of true north (about 11 degrees east of magnetic north here).  It was a funny orange color, round and had a moderately long tail of fire the same color.  Once the object got to around 20 degrees, it stopped and just hung there for about 15 seconds then disappeared. To be fair, Luke AFB is off in roughly the same direction at about 10 miles from this location, and the Thunderbirds are in town, however I have never seen an aircraft at night with fire coming out of its tail, drop straight down and stop mid air, sit there and disappear.  Since we are on the outskirts of the city we also see our share of meteors and I have never witnessed one doing anything remotely similar.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
