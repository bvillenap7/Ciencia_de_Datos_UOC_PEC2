My son and I pulled over to the side of the road to view the ship, more closely. This was not an airplane nor helicopter (there were just blocked shaped orangish-gold lights incapsulated on the edge of this pancake shaped ship. >> The the blocked shaped lights blinked while some type of cursor (or blinking straight line flowed over each light.  This ship looked as if it were behind the estrella mountains. It went up in the air like it had some type of hydraulics system. Then it came down the same way it went up, a feet only.
