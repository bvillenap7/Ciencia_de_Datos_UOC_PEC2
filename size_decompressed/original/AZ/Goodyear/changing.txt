Strange lights appear in night sky over Goodyear Arizona.;2007-11-06 19:30:00;5 seconds;Strange lights appear in night sky over Goodyear Arizona. My son (age 15) and I were traveling south on Estrella Parkway approx. 1/2 mile before the Gila river bridge when we both saw what appeared to be a stationary bright red-orange light above the Estrella Mountain foothills.  Suddenly to the east of this light a second light appeared and my son asked did I see it.  The second object also seemed stationary when almost as soon as we saw it a long straight row of 6-8 red-orange lights appeared to come out of it and spread to the east.  All the lights then collapsed into one another and again another row of 6-8 red-orange lights appeared further to the east of that again.   Those lights too then collapsed into one light and  it faded out of sight.  All of this gave the distinct appearance of a very large object of triangular shape with lights along 2 of its sides, rotating in the sky.  The second light remained constant but was soon lost behind the Estrella foothills and was not again visible as we drove further to the south.  My son and I have lived in this area for 10 years and we both felt this was clearly something we should report.  We contacted both the Goodyear police department and Maricopa county sheriffs office and were shocked that they had received no other reports.  I have never seen or reported such an event as this before.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137

Some of the balls of light dissappeared.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
