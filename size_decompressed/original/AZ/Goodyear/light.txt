A cell phone call to my wife following in another car confirmed she saw same lights. Similar to lights seen Mar. 7, 1997 in same area. My wife and I were driving separate cars home together on Estrella parkway which heads south at the point where I saw two amber lights through trees and low on the horizon over the area of Rainbow Valley south of Estrella Mountain Ranch. They appeared to be dropping below the crest of the hill up which we were travelling. As we arrived at the intersection of Elliot and Estrella Parkway they dropped below our line of sight into the area of Rainbow Valley. The area is southwest of the Estrella mountains. They lights were seen intermittently as we traveled from the beginning of the Estrella Mountain Ranch property until the intersection of Elliot and Estrella.  A time of about 5  minutes and a distance of several miles. I spoke to my wife by cell phone and she confirmed that she too saw the lights.  She thought they might be flares.  I had seen similar lights about 6 days before the March 13 PHX event in the same general area. I have reported that event in a separate correspondence with Peter,q.v. These lights are similar to those described and observed by others in the March 13, 1997 10 PM event over the Estrella Mountains.  The observer is a court reporter, a MUFON member and, a private pilot since 1949 with 30 plus years as a flight crew member with a major airline.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137

That was the last time I saw that light. The object was a light a very bright light that didn't move till it finally turned off and that was the last time I saw it then it looked like it had landed on a mountain far away from Phoenix;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
An amber light in the west sky.;2002-07-02 21:30:00;20 min.;An amber light in the west sky. Bright amber colored object,in west sky, hovered for about 5 min. then moved quicker than a star or planet, but slower than a plane.We also saw airforce jets in the sky around the object.It went below the horizon in a very short time then came back up into view.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
I looked up and saw an object that looked like a star-almost as bright as venus...this was too big and bright to be a satellite.;2004-03-12 19:00:00;3 minutes;I looked up and saw an object that looked like a star-almost as bright as venus...this was too big and bright to be a satellite. I live in the pathway of an aviation hwy which commercial airlines use (East/West)all day long, also at an inbound flight path for commercial airlines into Sky Harbor Airport at lower altitudes. I looked up and saw an object that looked like a star-almost as bright as venus, but was not travelling on the common aviation hwy rather heading more NNE crossing that hwy. The light cause a commercial airline to flash its headligts, but this object never replied or changed its path. It also made no noise and had no other visible lights blinking or any other colors. Once this odject passed overhead, Im guessing at about 5 to 10,000 feet, it was probably 15 miles away from me heading NE, and its light was eactly the same, just as bright as if it was a ball of light -as bright and big as Venus - as if it was using that look as camo. Anywhoo.. If it was a plane, the light would have vanished when it was past my location as I would not have been able to see the headlights anymore. So, after the flying planet was probably over phoenix, its light dimmed out until it was gone. This was too big and bright to be a satellite.  LATER ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Arizona Lights In The Sky Are Back;2006-05-15 20:30:00;15 minuets;Arizona Lights In The Sky Are Back To start this would be the second time that I see this. The wierde thing is that was a year ago but a few months apart but around the same time around the same location.. I was driving west bound on the I-10 when I noticed 5 bright lights in the sky.  It did not surprise me but gave a rush because this would be the second time I have seen this happen.  The sky was clear and i could see the lights clearly as I was driving. there was 5 bright lights which appeared to be round like a circle.  They were in a straight row unlike my 1st sighting in 2005.  There was no airpanes insight when the lights were around. i could not hear any noise that would explain the lights as they were low enogh that you should have been able to hear the roar of an engine or something.  i hurrie home so that i could get my camera and camecorder to take picturs and record my sighting this time but by the time I came back out which was a matter of seconds the lights were gone.  I know for a fact that what I seen in 2005 and my latest sighting on 5/15/2006 was not any kind of human aircraft or flairs.  WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR????   DO WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT BELONGS TO THEM??   WHY WOULD I SEE THEM A YEAR LATER?? ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended/corrected the date above.  PD));33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
Bright like disappears in Southwestern Sky over Goodyear, AZ.;2009-08-17 19:00:00;less than 1 minute;Bright like disappears in Southwestern Sky over Goodyear, AZ. Along with my wife, we witnessed a bright light in the Southwestern sky.  At first it appeared to be a star (no other stars were yet visible).  After watching the star for about 15 seconds it became less bright, but still visible.  Within another 20 seconds, it again became bright, then suddenly disappeared altogether.  Obviously, I have no clue if it what it was, possibly a weather balloon for all I know, but it was interesting, and most unusual.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
Perpendicular Light Formation.;2013-06-28 20:15:00;5 minutes;Perpendicular Light Formation While visiting our local dog park, in Goodyear, AZ, my husband and I along with 3 other witness's were looking off in the distance at the same time.  We all asked, what it was.   We saw a formation of 3 very bright lights, very clear with no haze in the sky all in a straight line, perpendicular and were all stationary.  There was no noise, no blinking lights, nothing.  Within a few moments, the top light zipped off up and to the right and disappeared.  The bottom 2 stayed still, for a few moments and zipped off down and to the left.   The whole event happened in about 5 minutes.  The lights moved at a very fast speed, literally within a blink of an eye.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
At least 12 red non-flashing lights flying east to west in night sky then disappear at same linear point in the sky.;2013-12-10 21:00:00;10 minutes;At least 12 red non-flashing lights flying east to west in night sky then disappear at same linear point in the sky. About 12 or more. non-flashing red lights moving east to west across the night sky equally spaced, yet in no definitive formation.   Once each had gotten to a particular area above us, they would either disappear or else turned off their lights as to not be visible.   At first believed to be jets or helicopters, but didn't sound nor act like them.   After they disappeared, the last one seen seemed to come lower in our direction, we ran inside to tell others and Immediately went outside again out of curiosity, but no more were present.  Took phone video footage, but nothing shows up.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137

Object with two lights on each far end that would stay in perfect sync and appear horizonal one minute then vertical within seconds;2020-04-23 22:00:00;30 minutes;Object with two lights on each far end that would stay in perfect sync and appear horizonal one minute then vertical within seconds We saw a very strange object with two lights on each far in in the sky last night that flew in a circular pattern for about 20-30 minutes and the object would be horizontal one minute then vertical the next as the two lights would stay in perfect sync on each end and the two lights would get closer together at times and then go apart really really far and appear as if the object was growing to a size that was 4 times the size of a normal aircraft.  It was also loud like an aircraft, but we couldn't see any body of the object or other lights besides the two lights on each end.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
Independence Day UFO sighting in Goodyear, Arizona.;2020-07-04 21:07:00;1 minute;Independence Day UFO sighting in Goodyear, Arizona. On July 4, 2020, I had a sighting that will stick with me for the rest of my life.  I was out in the backyard with my mom watching some fireworks when I saw two bright, red lights hovering in the sky.  After several moments, it was apparent this wasn’t a firework.  My first thought is that it might have been a drone (I’m an FAA Certified Part 107 drone pilot), but I’ve never seen a drone with lights like that.  Attached is a picture and a video I shot from my backyard.  This was taken in Goodyear, Arizona, and it appears to be within Goodyear airspace, which is restricted due to the nearby Air Force base (F-16 and F-35 training base) and several airports including the Goodyear Airport.  It was not moving at all, though the video was shaky because I was trying to get closer and the camera was unstable.  When I saw it, it was hovering there steadily.  After about a minute of doing so, the lights shut off like someone flipped a switch.  It didn't turn direction, it didn't descend or ascend, the lights just went out.  My mom saw it on a separate occasion, about 10 minutes earlier that same night. Her experience was different than mine. She saw it hovering and not moving at all. Then it abruptly moved to the right a little bit, the lights turned blue, and it disappeared.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
