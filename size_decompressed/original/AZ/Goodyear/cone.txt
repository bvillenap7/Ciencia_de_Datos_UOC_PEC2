Object was NE of our house.  I can't say how high up.  It didn't move.  I use binoculars and it appeared to cone shape and yellowish to orange looking through the binoculars.  It was bright white to the naked eye and appeared to be longer in length vertically.  My wife also thought it was an unusual shape.  I took two photos with my cellphone.  It then quickly disappeared straight away from us till it was just pin size.;33.4455122302158;-112.391151079137
Radiating Clouds.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 19:01:00;2 minutes;Radiating Clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD)) very difficult to describe, but basically looking at the westward skies, as I was driving, I saw what appeared to be a type of a halogen or aircraft light lite up.  At first I figured it was a plane enroute for approach, especially since I am so close to an airport, but then after looking at the light for a bit, it seemed to be far too bright to be a landing light and not to mention the direction it was coming from is not a typical approach. I am a pilot and can verify this for certain.  So any way, the light lit up, and although the skies were clear, a bright light enclosed by a cone shaped canopy was displayed.  I have never seen anything like this before - it was almost beautiful.  I am not conspiracy theorist, but I do have a solid scientific type of background, and can honestly say I was blown away by this since I've never seen anything like it before! the best way to describe the light would be similar to a movie of when a suspect is being in! terrogated by detectives in a smoky room with only a table lamp.  The light emitting from the lamp is basically similar to what I saw on a larger scale.  I was so fascinated by it, I immediately called my wife and asked her to look outside.  She didn't see the lights on, however the strangest thing she did see is that the clouds or smoke I originally saw was somehow still radiating like a bluish color even after the light diminished for several minutes.  It almost appeared as if the moon was behind the clouds, but just on a very smaller scale.  Any way, I went back home and kept on looking at the sky about half an hour later to see if I would see something again, and the skies were as clear as water no clouds smoke or anything.  It was extremely strange, and I have never done anything of this nature as far as reporting it - but I couldn't help myself!!!
