Bright red/orange balls of light in the SouthWest (Goodyear/Buckeye) sky;2004-06-14 20:30:00;20 minutes;Bright red/orange balls of light in the SouthWest (Goodyear/Buckeye) sky While driving home with my wife we first saw 7 bright and rather large orange/red balls of light south of the Estrealla Mountains in the vicinity of Buckyeye or Gila Bend. The objects were rather low in the sky, did not appear to be moving and slowly faded out. At one point it seemed as though there were more than 7 of them in a tight, slightly straight formation. Other people we passed on Estrealla Parkway heading South had pulled over to see them too. The lights seemed to be in the approach of Sky Harbor but none of the incoming aircraft seemed affected. As we traveled south on Estrealla Parkway we went through some mountains and when we finally got to a place where we could have a clear, south western view again, they were gone.
