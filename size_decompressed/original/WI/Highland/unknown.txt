Hovering lights in the clear night sky, flashing red orange and disappear;2008-03-18 20:45:00;15 seconds;Hovering lights in the clear night sky, flashing red orange and disappear I was about a half mile away from my home when I saw two flashing lights in the sky.  My initial thought was airplane, but I soon realized that the lights were far too big and were not moving at all.  I could not make out the exact shape of the UFO but I could tell about how big it was by the alternate flashing of lights on either side of it.  The lights appeared to be a red-orange color and were quite large.  I pulled over on the side of the road and rolled my driver side window down and turned down the radio.  The lights grew dim and it disappeared.  I had no idea what I had seen and thought that it may have went behind a cloud but when I got to my house and observed the same spot in the sky where I had seen it, the sky was crystal clear and no clouds were in sight and all of the stars were out.;43.0524;-90.365
