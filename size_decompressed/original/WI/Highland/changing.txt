It started as 2 balls hovering over an area in front of cabin 2.  The lights appeared to be circling each other then would break into multiple smaller colored orbs.  It appeared to shine a light into the woods on the south west side of the lake and then down in the water.  It was silent.  It appeared to go in and out of the water but didnt cause a ripple.  I walked down by the lake to be sure it wasn't a drone or something.  It came towards me and stopped half way to me and appeared to become agitated.  It began heading north across the lake very quickly.  I lost sight of it and headed back up to the campsite.  In the sky we then saw countless crafts in the sky mainly gravitating towards one very large orange light that was darting around in the southern sky in the same general area.  There was another larger craft in the northern sky that was a completely different shape that was! also moving erratically in the same area.  This when to nor an hour or so and around 3:30 the began moving farther away and the lights slowly faded out.  Our dog was freaking out and acting like we've never seen.  It was completely silent the whole time.  The water developed a weird ripple to the east of the water event with a heavy fog.;43.0524;-90.365
