((Starlink satellites?));2019-12-22 18:35:00;15 minutes;A stream of slow moving lights coming from the west and disappearing as they flew overhead. Looking to the west above the horizon at about 18:35 several of us saw these lights coming from the west.  One after the other spaced about a minute apart they would come from the west in a straight line then disappear as they got about overhead.  This went on for about 15 minutes.;42.705;-88.118
