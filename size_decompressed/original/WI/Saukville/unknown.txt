The object that I seen lastnight had one red and one blue large brightlights. I cannot exactly explain how these lights moved. As I watched it through my binoculars the red and blue lights suddenly appeared to be two very bright white lights. At this time the object seemed to just be hovering. The  object then stayed like this for several minutes. It then started to move around within the area and then moved swiftly behind the house next door.I was spooked and came in the house.About 2-3 minutes later I  went back outside and walked a couple houses down to see if I could still see anything behind or around the house next door. I did not.;43.3906;-87.9611
