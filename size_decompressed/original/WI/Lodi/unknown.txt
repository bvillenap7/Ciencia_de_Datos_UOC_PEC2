Strobing star;2000-12-31 20:30:00;1 hour;Strobing star This is reminiscent of the sighting on 11/2/00 from Oostburg.  I noticed a strobing light in the South east sky.  It sat motionless for about 1 hour flashing Red Green and Blue.  It appeared to move slightly with the other stars athough there were clouds which eventually obstructed my view. This may be a star but I have never seen one which changed colors so dramatically.  If some knows which star or planet this is let me know I will check again in the same location the next clear night and if it appears again I must assume it is a natural phenomenom.;43.327;-89.5554000000001
