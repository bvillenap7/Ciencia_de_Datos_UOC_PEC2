Fast moving boomerang shaped object.;2017-11-07 19:35:00;5 seconds;Fast moving boomerang shaped object A large boomerang or chevron shaped object flying east to west.  Altitude/air speed unknown, but it was moving very fast and it was large.  No sound.  It was blacked out with no running lights.  The shape of the object against a background of stars was the only thing that gave it away.   As I watched it fly overhead and turned west to watch it fly away, a smaller and faster object from the Northeast flew in behind it.  All of this was over in 5 seconds.   I'm 50, x-military and have never seen anything like this before. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, It was 2x the size of a full moon, however boomerang shaped and completely dark, but duller than the night sky.  I picked it up almost directly above me at 70 degrees and followed it to about 140, until I lost it.   It blocked star light as passed.  It was moving very very fast and the size / speed / altitude did not equate properly in my mind based on anything I've previously experienced.  Then something smaller with a dull white light closed on it from a few degrees North East.  It all took 4-5 seconds max.  There was no sound. The only think I equate it to would be a B2 at 2,000 feet traveling at Mach 10 with no sound.  Impossible. I don't know that I'll call the media, but I will be checking local media for any other reports over the next few days. Regards,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
