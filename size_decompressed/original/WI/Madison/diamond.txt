3 transparent gray diamond apperitions with red lights hovering high in the night sky;2013-07-29 23:00:00;10 seconds;3 transparent gray diamond apperitions with red lights hovering high in the night sky I, my husband, my husbands daughter, and my two dogs were out for our regular evening walk through East high schools football field.  As we were just entering the field from north fifth street, my husband started shouting look up!  Look straight above!.  It took me and my husbands daughter a second or two to spot what he was seeing.   All three of us saw three diamond shaped apparitions with red lights on the outside edges of all three diamonds.  All three were hovering/moving in unison, with the front object being slightly in front of the other two.  The objects appeared to be almost transparently gray in color, and appeared to be quite high in the sky.  As we all three watched, they continued moving forward quite quickly, and seemed to disappear into the atmosphere.  The event lasted all of about ten seconds.  We all agreed that it was a very strange occurrence, and that none of us had ever seen anything like it before.  The apparitions are a b! it hard to describe, but I have described them as best as I could.  Thank you for the opportunity to report.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
4 red lights in a tight diamond shape, later to split into 2 sets of 4 Red lights in a diamond shape.;2019-07-13 21:35:00;2 minutes tops;4 red lights in a tight diamond shape, later to split into 2 sets of 4 Red lights in a diamond shape. I work as a food delivery driver in Madison, Wisconsin, and on July 13th, at approximately 21:35 hours  I had a delivery to make and I happened to glance up into the night sky to the south.  I’m used to seeing various aircraft, both Civilian, military and commercial come and go through Truax field.  But this didn’t have the typical aircraft light set up with the Red and green navigation lights, nor was there typical landing lights.  Plus growing up near Davis Monthan AFB, I knew my aircraft well. This was 4 red lights in a vertical diamond formation, in an up and down diamond, not a horizontal layout.  Rather close to each other with no real space in between the lights as an aircraft would have between the wings.  The object was hovering in the air, not moving at all. I was at first thinking it was possibly a drone since it was just hovering.  It also made no noise whatsoever, unlike a typical light aircraft or commercial aircraft.  And it certainly wasn’t a F-16 thats stationed here.  Compared to the near full moon, it was maybe a quarter the size of the moon.  I continued watching, pulling my car over to watch it more.  Two bicyclists peddling past also looked up, but continued peddling north. At that point the object was moving north,  and I lost sight of it through some tall trees blocking my view.  I moved further south  and looked back to see the object heading north.  Then stop again.  And then  it split into two objects, both of 4 red lights.  And quickly both sets of lights left the area.  One heading north, the other west.  It took just a few seconds to lose sight of both.  I had viewed the object/objects at most a full 2 minutes.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
