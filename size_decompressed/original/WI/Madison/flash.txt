Saw lights flashing in the sky non-stop for hours, freaked my dog out.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-06 22:30:00;3-4 hours;Saw lights flashing in the sky non-stop for hours, freaked my dog out I was sitting in my living room, and noticed flashing lights outside of my window.  At first I assumed it was just lightning, but lightning usually doesn't flash non-stop for hours at a time.  I walked outside to find the source of the flashing light, thinking maybe it was a tow truck or something.   Upon walking outside, there was no apparent source of the flashing lights.  I looked up but clouds were blocking any chance of me being able to distinguish what was causing the flashing.   My dog, who usually runs to the door when asked if she wants to go out, refused to leave the house, even when bribed with treats.
