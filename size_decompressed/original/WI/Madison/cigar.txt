Cigar shaped object seen over Madison, WI,  10/16/18 at 3:50 PM;2018-10-16 15:50:00;1.5 minutes;Cigar shaped object seen over Madison WI 10/16/18 at 3:50PM I was leaving work at 3:50 PM on 10/16/2018 just passing the Costco store in Middleton heading east on Eagle Drive.  I looked up and observed what I first thought was a passenger jet coming over the city from the Dane County airport.  Something seemed a bit off, so I looked again and was unable to distinguish the presence of either wings or a tail section.   I pulled over on Eagle Drive next to Costco and observed what looked like a large cylindrical object, about the size of an A320 if not a bit longer.  It was white in color and aerodynamically tapered at both ends and had what appeared to be a red vertical stripe that separated the forward going half from the trailing half.  There appeared to be no windows or other openings.  It was moving in a North Westerly direction and was traveling very slowly.   The duration of the sighting was approximately one to one and a half minutes or so.   As it was heading off in the distance I saw a smaller aircraft the details of which I could not determine that looked as though it was flying at a higher altitude and moving in an East Southeasterly direction.  My background is an Electronics Technician.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
