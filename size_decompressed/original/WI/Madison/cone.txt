My view was breifly blocked, then it appeared again breifly much farther away. The object looked more like the top half of a sphere than a cone.  The flat bottom was darker, but the top part was flickering white. Flickering probably isn't the best way to describe it.  The white parts almost seemed to be flowing about the top half.  It was not moving, just hovering slightly underneath the clouds.  My first reaction was NOT Wow, thats a UFO.  My first reaction WAS What the hell is that thing?  Once I ruled out airplane and helicopter, it occurred to me that it might be a UFO.  After watching it flicker for a minute or two, I drove behind a hill, blocking my view.  When I came around the hill, the object was gone.  I immediately began scanning the sky for it again, and I found what appeared to be the same object, only much farther away, and much closer to the horizon. Again, my view was blocked, and that was the last I saw of it.  I would just like to know if there were any other witnesses of this object, or if I am going loony.  Thanks.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
