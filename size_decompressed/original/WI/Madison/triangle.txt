Triangular craft over Madison, WI;2011-10-27 23:30:00;5-7 seconds;Triangular craft over Madison, WI I was playing fetch with my dog in Central park in Madison, WI around 11:30 p.m. when I saw a light out of the corner of my eye.  I thought at first that I was witnessing a shooting star.  I looked to my left and saw what was a triangular shaped craft with dim white-blue light along the front two edges with a brighter headlight at the front.  The craft was completely silent, headed away from my location toward the horizon. The sky was mostly clear but hazy to about 40 degrees off the horizon. When the craft was over the clear sky it was completely transparent and when it entered hazy portions of the sky I could clearly see it.  My estimation would bee that it was flying 1000-3000ft in the sky.  I have never in my life seen an aircraft like this.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Two air crafts both with huge red circular lights.;2012-02-08 19:15:00;5 minutes;Two air crafts both with huge red circular lights. I was walking home from work on the evening of February 8, 2012.  About a block away from my apartment I looked towards the sky straight above.  I also looked to the right and noticed that the stars were extra vivid and crisp on this night.  I looked farther ahead of me and saw two abnormal bright-like stars. I assumed that they were planets but I have never seen two so close together.  Then, again, I look to the right of me and up above I notice a very huge circular red light.  Also accompanying the red light were smaller white-amber-ish lights on each side of the bigger red light.  The sequence of the blinking lights were unfamiliar to me and extremely close to the ground hovering, in movement. I do not exactly remember how long each blink measured but knew immediately they were unfamiliar.  At this point I was in shock.  I was less than a block away from my home and instead of going straight home I followed in the direction of the red light.  It seemed as ! though the entire craft was a red sphere as it drew away. I turned a left on the street before my block and realized that not only did these lights look foreign but also they were headed in the wrong direction.  Had they been lights from an airplane, the craft should have been traveling more East towards the airport.  Instead the craft was traveling SE. It definitely could not have been an airplane because it was too low to the ground and I heard no sound from where I stood. Through my vision the craft could have been traveling at a speed of maybe 40 MPHâ€¦?  I did not get a good look at the shape of this particular craft because as I followed it, it traveled further away flying over tall houses and apartment buildings which blinded my sight. The duration of the craft siting was about a minute long.  	After that I walked towards my apartment. It took less than two minutes to get to my front porch. I immediately sat down and just stared into the night sky. Not one minute had passed when I saw another red light coming towards my direction from the NW. It traveled over Lake Mendota toward my apartment building. I cleared my eyes completely amazed. This craft also had a sequence of odd blinking lights not like the sequence of lights you see on planes or helicopters. The lights also had short awkward pauses and then would resume to the blinking pattern. These lights were also very close to the ground. As the craft got closer I could kind of make out a shape. It was quite dark but my best educated guess would be that the craft had a shape of a triangle prism. The craft also looked like it had a disk-like base and the lights were blinking on the front of the base. As the craft traveled over the apartment building next to mine, I noticed that the underside of the base of the cra! ft looked like half of a sphere. I could not make out any color of the craft due to the time of the evening. Interesting to say, the craft traveled SE just like the first had. I was much closer to this craft than the first but I would assume the speed of travel was 50 MPH.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Spotted triangular craft floating to the right of beltline. Went out of view for thirty seconds, couldn't find again.;2014-08-20 22:00:00;2 minutes;Spotted triangular craft floating to the right of beltline.  Went out of view for thirty seconds, couldn't find again. I was riding on the beltline, heading west.  From the Verona Road exit, to the Odana Road exit which we exited on, me and the one person I was with noticed three different colored lights that appeared to be hovering to the west.  I kept my eyes on it, and as our angle changed, I noticed the triangular shape.  When we exit, we attempt to spot it again but it was gone.

Spot light turned off, triangle pattern lights, helicopter noise, dog bark, shooting stars;2015-11-02 21:00:00;5 minutes;Spot light turned off, triangle pattern lights, helicopter noise, dog bark, shooting stars Was playing disc golf at night with lights and from the peek of hole 2 we saw a spot light above some trees in the hole 12 area.  It sounded like a helicopter.  It turned off the spot light and it had more of a spinning sound.  Could see blue lights that seemed to move in a triangle shape.  There was a red light in the middle.  My dog started barking as it got closer. He has never barked at an air craft before.  This course is in the country around some farms. We sometimes play at a course near the air port and he has never barked.  We saw shooting starts through out the night. I was stunned by the sight so much I thought I should grab my phone but could not look away.  It was near us then just a light in the distance heading south. My friend and I decided it was not a normal craft and it had to be something from the government or a UFO. Sort of sounded like what this person described:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/123/S123336.html   I didn't remember the exact night but I know it was that week I listed this.  I just found this site and I have never felt more sure what I saw was not normal.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

Hovering jet over Malt House.;2017-11-30 13:30:00;2 minutes;Hovering jet over Malt House A friend and I saw a small craft flying only twenty feet above the Malt House off of East Washington.  As it came closer it stopped for two seconds and then continued on.  It was grey, almost looked like a jet with a black bubble on top.  It only made a low hum.  It was only big enough for one person.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Large triangle object/ craft emitting extremely bright light and deploying smaller lights/ objects;2020-08-04 03:00:00;1.5 hours;Large triangle object/ craft emitting extremely bright light and deploying smaller lights/ objects This sighting took place over two nights/ mornings starting on August 4th, 2020.  August 4th, 2020- 0300 hours: I witnessed a large in scale object in the sky in a Northeast position above the State Capitol building in downtown Madison Wisconsin.  It was emitting an extremely bright white light that was almost difficult to stare at due to it's intensity.  The object in question was mostly stationary in the sky only varying a pattern of clockwise movement in a minute fashion, and was slowly rotating on axis.  It was roughly 30 to 40,000 feet in altitude, and in comparison to cargo jets flying nearby it was determined to be at least 4 to 5 times the size of a large jumbo jet (example being an Airbus A380). The object in question was not a satellite or the ISS due to it's size, placement within the atmosphere/ sky, and contradiction to ISS flight path per NASA source.  0330: I witnessed several small lights/ lighted objects dart out of the primary object in question, they flew out in all directions toward the horizon.  The object maintained a super- vibrant light emission and proximity to the aforementioned.  0400: The object began to slowly move upward in the sky and diminish in size as if moving out of the atmosphere.  Just after dawn broke it was gone.  August 5th, 2020- 0300: The object in question returned, but at a much higher altitude/ further distance than the prior night, it again maintained a somewhat fixed position for a period of time though was rotating on axis more.  I maintained observation as able while performing work duties.  0330: I observed the object in question intensify and diminish it's light projection, and begin to move to higher altitude/ outward toward atmosphere, then back to previous altitude.  0400: I observed several of the smaller lights/ objects move from west to east under the primary large craft in question, then spontaneously disappear just low and east of the large object.  The large object had maintained the high intensity light emission once again.  0430: The large object in question once again moved upward and outward in a moderate consistent pace out of the atmosphere until it had disappeared from physical view right around dawn breaking.
