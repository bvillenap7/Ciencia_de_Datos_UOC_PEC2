Three Lights in formation suddenly split directions and disappear.;1990-07-22 01:00:00;10 minutes;Three Lights in formation suddenly split directions and disappear. Three of us, all Care Techs at Mendota Mental Health Institute, were out sailing on Lake Mendota, after our 3-11 shift.  The skipper and I were chatting.  He was at the tiller and I had the job of intermittently shining a flashlight onto the sail to let other vessels know we were out there.  At 01:00, we noticed we hadn't heard from our third member in a while.  We kidded him, asking if he was asleep, because he was laid back, face to the sky. He answered with a laugh and said he'd been watching three interesting lights. He pointed them out to us.  They were very high in the sky if one horizon was three o'clock and the other horizon was nine o'clock, then these lights were now at about 11:30, nearly overhead. He said he'd been watching them for a long time and they hadn't changed formation.  They were arranged in a triangular formation, one light leading the other two, and they were just progressing across the sky.  It was hard to distinguish them from the stars on this clear night, they seemed to be just about that size and brightness.  We thought, at first, it was a plane but then noted you could see the background stars between them as they went. The lights finally made it to directly overhead and they stopped.  They just sat in place for about half a minute.  Then, from a complete stop, they shot apart in three directions and out of sight in a brief second.  We had no idea what they were.  No one talked about seeing them the next day.  No coverage in the news media.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Orange Light witnessed by friend and cat;1990-12-12 09:00:00;?;Orange Light witnessed by friend and cat Living with an ex-girlfriend, we had our own rooms. She told me she had woken up in the night and a bright orange light was coming from the room i was in, she saw an orange halo around the doorframe. Got up from her bed and came into the room i was in, looked around. It was bright, and she also said she felt good, noticeably better in the room with the light. Then, for some reason, she went back to bed, could still see the light glowing. One of our cats got up, then, from in her room, and came to my doorway,looking around awhile. Only coming partially in though, as if uncertain as to just what was going on in there...  also relevant may be a dream i had that night, in which i was walking with someone else thru a forest, feeling aware ans semi-cautious, when i looked up above us and saw a man sliding slowly, at first, and then quickly, along a thick tree branch and dropping to the ground. He wore almost caveman-like clothing, chest bare, head huge and brain-shaped. The guy i was with was about to shoot at him but his gun didn't work... ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Strange light inside Lake Monona;1997-09-30 22:00:00;5 minutes;Strange light inside Lake Monona my girlfriend and i (we're now married) were walking by Lake Monona one evening when we saw a light in the lake, under the surface of the water but pretty close to shore. At first, i thought maybe it was scuba divers or something, but it was just sitting there, not like someone was swimming around. It seemed strange, and everything around us seemed still, no other people around. After watching it and wondering aloud to each other about what the light could be, it just blinked out or something and was gone. We looked around a bit but never saw anybody climb out of the water or anything, and eventually got back in our car and left. My wife says she has never seen anything weird like this before or since. It kind of spooked her... and later, her youngest sister (aorund 20 yrs. old) told us she'd had a dream about my wife and i walking by some water somewhere and there was a ufo involved somehow, which adds an extra wrinkle to the story i reckon.

(Just so you realize the context of this story, and the fact that NONE of us were under the influence of anything chemical.) I was the featured speaker for a meeting at a clubhouse that hosts meetings of our organization. During my talk, which was about my life and how I got sober, I happened to mention, humorously, that I had always felt like an alien in my family, and in the world. I even had a little alien doll with me that my daughter had given me as a joke. After my talk, which ended at 8:30PM CST, I was standing around inside the building chatting with some of my fellow recovering folk, when one of our brethren came into the room where we were and yelled: Hey, (my name)...Your people are here!!! Several of us went outside to see what our friend was yelling about. To our surprise, hovering over Lake Mendota, very close to the house, four light objects were hovering silently. They hovered in a staggered formation for a few moments, almost like motorcylists riding on a highway. One broke away from the the others and drifted slowly toward the roof of a large apartment building next to our clubhouse. It hovered over the apartment roof for a few moments, winked out abruptly, and just as abruptly reappeared with the other three again. All four objects pulsated, changed colors, and alternately grew dimmer and brighter as we watched them. There were no noises associated with them, although several of our group were noisily making jokes about them. We were all pretty amazed, albeit somewhat skeptical, and thoroughly curious. Eventually, one by one, they all grew very dim and disappeared from our view. The even took approximately 10 minutes. There were roughly about 20 of us in the parking lot. I would estimate the distance between us and the lights to be about a quarter of a mile...maybe. It's hard to judge distances at night, particularly in that neighborhood. I do not know what the lights were or what they might have meant. I accepted the e! vent as either explainable, or else God having a bit of fun with me, since I had mentioned feeling like an alien.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Hovering lights above Madison, Wisconsin seen by many;2001-03-30 21:35:00;10 minutes;Hovering lights above Madison, Wisconsin seen by many On the evening of March 30, 2001 I exited a building with a group of three other people and noticed others looking up.  When we looked up in the sky there was an apparent group of 3 hovering red lights in the sky.  They seemed to hold an apparent triad shaped formation and they just hovered and occasionall one would blink bright white a total of 2 or three times and then another would almost appear to answer.  This was not far from the capitol building in Madison.  Many others had witnessed this.  We watched for a bit and drove off and they remained in sight for quite some time.  I hope others who saw this will write their accounts as well.  I have never heard of a fighter plane that could hover in the same place, I have never seen an object in the sky brighten as if flashing its lights to signal to another.  Could this be some kind of lazer light show hoax?  Maybe but highly unlikely!

Spherical greenish-white glowing light in the sky moving very fast to the North/Northeast;2001-07-31 23:15:00;5 seconds;Spherical greenish-white glowing light in the sky moving very fast to the North/Northeast At 23:15 on 7/31/2001, I was going home from work, driving East on Madison's West Beltline Highway near Gammon Road. I saw a very bright, spherical greenish-white light appear in the sky from my driver's side window. The window was totally rolled down so it could not have been a reflection. The spherical light was very bright with a kind of glow or aura around it and not pure white but instead greenish-white. The light was steady with no other flashing lights visible. When I first noticed it, it was about the relative size of my thumbnail held out at arm's length and got smaller as it moved very fast to the North/Northeast. I saw it for about 5 seconds before it went out of view on the horizon. There was no visible trail like a meteor has and it seemed closer in the sky more like the height of a passenger jet. It seemed to be moving in a straight line from directly over my truck towards the North/Northeast horizon. It seemed to be moving faster than a jet. I did not hear any noise or sonic boom over the sound of my moving truck as it went by. The sky was clear and dark with stars visible.

Second sighting...Madison, WI;2002-09-20 03:00:00;unsure...maybe 5?;Second sighting...Madison, WI This is my second submission. My first submission concerned a sighting witnessed by myself and several others. This particular sighting was all mine. I awoke just a minute or two before 3:00AM and went to use the facilities. As I was standing at the sink washing my hands, I noticed a light over Lake Mendota. Assuming it was a rescue helicopter bound for the University of WI Hospitals and Clinics ER, I looked away and finished washing up. When I looked again, I noticed the light had become somewhat brighter, and had not moved from the spot where it had been before. Now, having witnessed something like this before, AND having just seen the movie Signs several hours before, I wasn't willing to accept that this was anything unusual. As I watched the light, it began to change color and pulsate. I actually spoke out loud and said: Oh, not THIS again! half in jest, and half in earnest. As I said that, a small, red light poppped out and shot away from the larger light. Zip! And it was gone. At that point, I decided I'd seen enough. I spoke again, out loug, and said: Look, you guys...either take me with you or go away!. Then I went back to bed. I have no explanations. I neither believe nor disbelieve in UFOs, aliens, or other odd phenomena. I'm only reporting what I've seen.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

Bright light flying at a low level and high rate of speed - much faster than any aircraft and too low to be a conventional space craft.;2003-08-31 22:30:00;10 Sec.;Bright light flying at a low level and high rate of speed - much faster than any aircraft and too low to be a conventional space craft. My wife and I were driving from Sun Prairie to Madison at 10:30 pm on 8/31/03, just north of the airport.  My wife was sleeping at the time.  I saw a bright light screeming across the sky, from southwest to northeast, at a fairly low level (approximately 10,000-15,000 foot range).  It was traveling much faster than any jet plane, and my first thought was meteorite - but it was flying horizontal, not in a downward direction, and there was no trail behide it.  It was also flying much faster than any craft that would have been flying in or out of the airport - and at a direction not in line with any runways.  There was one airplane coming into the airport from the oposite (south) side of the city, and the pilot may have seen what I saw, although he/she was likely preoccupied in preparation for landing.  I only saw it for a few seconds as it was moving so fast.  When we arrived at home, I told my wife about it.  The next day, she heard part of a brief report on either CNN or Headline News about a light in the sky seen somewhere - but didn't catch any details.  Wondering if there is any more info. about the other report(s) - where else this was seen - etc.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Four bright white lights in a row, descended sharply and diminished to a flashlight size and winked out and hit ground.;2004-08-21 22:10:00;10-15 min.;Four bright white lights in a row, descended sharply and diminished to a flashlight size and winked out and hit ground. On August 21, 2004 at approximately 10:10 P.M. CST I noticed a very odd phenomenon  over Interstate 90/94 southbound between Poynette, WI and DeForest, WI.  My wife and I were driving home from central Wisconsin from a friends cottage.  No alcohol or drugs were consumed at the outing. It was a very clear night and the stars were very visible.  My wife and I both noticed a bright white light in the sky.  She asked what it was and I responded jokingly, a UFO.  It was extremely bright and was composed of four lights in a row flying perpendicular to our line of travel.  At first we thought they must be landing lights on an airliner.  However the four lights in a row were not right.  Usually there is some separation between the lights. There was none.  Between us and the lights there was a microwave tower with a red light on it,  the lights appeared miles beyond the tower.  We passed the tower in about a quarter to half mile.  Then the lights started to descend.  I thought it might be a plane landing at the Dane county airport a few miles to the south.  But it wasn't turning toward the airport as it should have.  It proceeded straight across the highway about what initially looked to be about a quarter mile ahead of us.  It then came down very steeply and I though it was going to crash in the woods next to the highway.  Instead the lights dropped in intensity until it looked about the size of a flashlight.  It then winked out and appeared to land on the shoulder of the road directly to our right.  When it winked out it was the size of a computer keyboard and appeared to fly into the woods next to the road.  It was not a bird.  We could not stop as it was a crowded interstate and had a steep ditch next to the road.  We proceeded home to Madison and I filed this report.  It was definitely an Unconventional Flying Object.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

Madison Sighting  8/25/07;2007-08-25 22:48:00;10 seconds;Madison Sighting  8/25/07 I would like to report to NUFORC a sighting which occurred last night, 25 August 2007 at about 2248 Central time just north of Madison,WI.  At that time,my fiancee (who was driving) and I had just passed Madison on our way home to the Twin Cities from Chicago on I-94.  I noticed a bright object moving from north of us to the south, which I initially took to be the ISS (space station).  The first glimpse put this object at the 1100 position (assuming the hood of our car is the 1200 position, and it was to the west of us about 35 degrees off the horizon.  As I am a former member of the military (16 Tango - ADA) I was extensively trained in visual identification of both man made and naturally occuring atmospheric phenomena.  I quickly deduced that this was in fact not the ISS due to its increasingly fast speed.  This object did not have any visible navigational lighting, nor strobes.  I watched the object traverse the entire expanse of sky from the 1100 position to our front, to about the 630 position behind us all in about 10 seconds before it disappeared into nothing. Within a few minutes I contacted the Columbia County Sheriff to describe the incident, and left my name and number. I am very interested in knowing what this object was, and if anyone else sighted this very fast thing near Madison last night.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

Amber orange light moving very slowly, dimming out, shooting away.;2009-10-11 21:55:00;3 minutes;Amber orange light moving very slowly, dimming out, shooting away. I was in my second story bedroom, when a bright light caught my eye. Our house is quite close to the local airport and is almost directly under a common flight path taken by incoming airplanes. It is therefore extremely common to observe planes with bright, white flight lights approaching from the south. For a number of reasons, however, this was different:  1. Even indoors with the windows closed, you can always hear approaching passenger planes. They are very loud, because they are very low. This object made no sound audible from inside the house. 2. The path taken by planes on their approach is completely predictable (essentially, they go over our neighbor's house to the east). This went over our neighbor's house to the west. 3. It was moving very slowly. Because it was a light in the sky, I feel it's hard to say how far up it was it seemed like it wasn't much higher than 2 or 3 times the height of the tall, mature trees in our neighborhood. Could be wrong about the height. Regardless, it appeared to be making the progress of a car going around 5mph (if it was as close as it appeared). 4. The light was bright amberish orange, unlike the lights of the passenger jets that pass overhead ... bright white at first and then red and blue flashing lights as they get closer. Because it looked odd, I went outside to our porch to get a better look. I found it in the sky again outside. I could still hear no sound. Again, it seemed strange because it was moving so slowly. Its path was completely straight and it moved from roughly south to north. I tried to film it with my cheap digital camera, but the camera was unable to pick up the small light. After a minute of observation, it had finally reached a point parallel with our house. Then, the light dimmed out completely. As I turned to go back inside, a speck of light shot very quickly upwards from the point where the light had dimmed. This final observation, of sudden insanely fast movement, is what really spooked me. I've seen plenty of lights in the sky that have seemed odd, but I always felt that my impression could be a misinterpretation of something mundane. This event seemed truly weird.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

Red/orange light seen east of Madison, WI.;2016-08-13 21:40:00;<10 minutes;Red/orange light seen east of Madison, WI. I noticed a reddish/orange colored light directly east above the tree line from my balcony.  It looked strange enough for me to stop and actually watch for a few minutes.  It was hard to say how far it was from me, but I would guess between 2-5 miles...  Which would make the light technically above Cottage Grove, WI, and not Madison, WI, where I was located.  Estimated at about 500-700ft in the sky.  It was likely located above farm fields.  I watched the light hover for ~3 minutes before it began to fade into a smaller light.  It faded within 5 seconds to 20% of its original brightness and began moving south east and appeared to be moving further away.  It followed this path for about a minute before it disappeared into the sky above the tree line.  There were no clouds in the sky.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

Rapidly fluctuated between white blue purple, basically flashing very rapidly.   Used binoculars to get a better look but was very difficult to keep in frame due to how far away and small it was.   Kinda looked like a star would but the rapid flashing was very strange.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

Lights moving in a straight line at constant speed, remaining evenly spaced.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-06 19:30:00;3 minutes;Similar to some previous reports on here.  Lights moving in a straight line at constant speed, remaining evenly spaced.  When they crossed the Northern cardinal line, they simply disappeared.  I counted seven craft but was in contact with a friend in Brodhead who said he spotted at least 70!  Sattelites, or perhaps something else?;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Exact distance between lights, their speed from each other.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-06 19:45:00;5 minutes;Exact distance between &quotlights&quot, their speed from each other I watched 14 lights in exact linear formation move from the SW to NE in rapid formation (no blinking lights in exact intervals) roughly at 70-80 degrees from the horizon at Madison, Wisconsin.  2 were lead lights more closely spaced.  No sound & no vapor trails.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
