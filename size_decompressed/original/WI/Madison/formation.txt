The v;1999-12-01 22:00:00;10 seconds;We saw 3 lights, as bright as stars in the city, move due south. They seemed to be 1000's of feet above us and moving quite fast. The very weird thing was that they oscillated rapidly in a lateral direction while moving. My girlfriend and I stepped off of our front porch in downtown Madison, circa December 1999. Looking straight up to see the stars, as I am wont to do, I noticed three lights in a triangular formation moving very rapidly to the South. The lights were about as bright as stars and seemed to be very high in the sky. From the time I noticed them until the time they left the horizon it was, at most, 10 seconds. The thing that was very bizarre was that all three of the lights oscillated or jiggled very rapidly in a lateral direction as they flew.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Four orange objects in formation followed by another.;2007-07-14 01:19:00;4 seconds;Four orange objects in formation followed by another. I went out at night and looked up, and I saw four uniformly lit orangish lights in formation accelerating westwards, and then another slightly larger light to the north following it.  The objects were appoximately egg-shaped, although it was hard to tell because of their speed, and their brightness was approximately one-third of the moon.  They were about a third of the size of the moon, and the four were in a paralellogram formation, with the long ends facing east to west.  They resembled fighter planes flying in formation because of the relative movement to each other when they traveled, but the accelerated so quickly that no plane could ever go this fast.  The formation was about two times as long as the moon, and about one moon or less wide.  The objects were silent and appeared to be at a very high altitude, yet they accelerated very quickly and uniformly.  As soon as I looked up they began accelerating and in about 2 seconds they went from directly overhead to close to the horizon and out of sight.  A second later the other object to the north followed with the same acceleration and speed.  This other object seemed to take off from kind of a small curve, and then it followed a straight line.  The sky was completely clear so I know these couldn't have been reflections.  I know what meteors look like and I am certain these were not them.  Also, I have seen some of the fastest planes in the world flying overhead at low altitudes, and they were nowhere near as fast as the objects I saw on this night.  Furthermore, I saw almost exactly the same thing in the same city approximately eight or nine years ago and remember it vividly.  I figured since I saw the same thing again I would report it.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
3 orange glowing lights hovering moving slowly to the Northeast near Madison/ Deforest WI;2014-01-08 18:00:00;2 minutes;3 orange glowing lights hovering moving slowly to the Northeast near Madison/ Deforest WI On January 8th, I was driving home from work in Madison, WI (6pm).  I was heading North on hwy 51 towards the interstate 90/94. and I notice to orange glow lights.  I saw them for a brief moment as I turn onto the Interstate heading North toward the Dells.  I then saw it again (I was near or just pasted hwy 19 now) this time much more clearer and their were three orange glow lights moving very slowly North East.  They had a color very similar to street lights (Orange in color rather big) One of the lights faded then the next one until it disappeared.  It look like it was hovering and moving very slowly  to the North east.  As the last light went out it started to move faster and faded.     I told people at work the following day  and a coworker was in Portage Northeast of were I was an described the same thing except is was later in the evening around 9PM.  This location is near Madison Airport, however this was not an Airplane!!  it was moving to slow and for too long of a time (at least a minute)..   I am now a believer of UFO's and if this was some type of Military Aircraft it was huge and it could hover.   Truly something amazing...;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

I saw 5 lights floating in a formation..  They burned out or turned off one by one...  I took a video and tried to figure a rational explanation..  Flares burn out amd shoot up quicker..  Lanterns do not stay in formation. The lights stayed in formation for the duration and went out one by one. Then I heard planes.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
