I pointed it out and saidWhat the hell is that? ((name deleted)) said he had no idea, then it abruptly vanished. It was about a mile in the distance, judging by familiar landmarks. It was, guessing for distance and altitude, about fifty feet in diameter, spherical, silver, and NOT a weather balloon. It moved rapidly about one mile in a couple of seconds, parallel to the ground, then stopped. Then it was gone, no explosion, no descent or ascent, just gone. Thats about the extent of it. Not very exciting, just odd. However, in 1970 in Eau Claire, WI, My sister and a friend were walking to my parents house from her friends house. The walk, at a leisurely pace, takes about twenty minutes. My sister noticed a large brightly lit saucer in the sky, as did her friend. They observed it for a couple minutes, then got scared and hurried home, running most of the way. Upon arriving home, my sister was grounded for being 2 1/2 hours late. She said that she couldn't be late, she ran home and it only took her about ten minutes. My mother didn't believe her, so the grounding stuck. For the following 15 years, my sister was afflicted with stange buzzing sounds in her head. She also remembers that when they started to run, the saucer was no longer there. Deputy Sherrifs in Eau Claire County obsreved a similar object over a hill near my parents about a month prior to that, but that one was a couple hundred yards in diameter. It scorched the tops of the trees on the hill, which was observable for about ten years after. I remember the trees being burned, as I grew up with the hill visible outside my bedroom window, about a half mile away. I was born about 9 months after these events took place.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

Tanslucent orange/yellow UFO in Madison WI;2008-10-10 22:30:00;20 Secounds;Tanslucent orange/yellow UFO in Madison WI   My wife and I were driving on John Nolen drive around 9:30 PM and observed 1 translucent orange/yellow circle UFO move down from the sky slow then came at an angle and made insanely fast maneuvers in a triangle pattern and then disappear into the sky. The object was very close to us I would say around 500 feet. Also on a side not my wife has observed this same type of UFO 3 time before this in a 2 year span. She saw it twice near HWY 30 near Fair Oaks and the other time was in Cottage Grove. We just thought it was a jet or something but after I saw it myself and didn't hear anything or see any blinking lights and as fast as the UFO moved it made me a believer and i still don't know what to think. I surprised no one else saw anything on John Nolen. I thought it would be in the news it was so obvious. The event took about 20-30 seconds and just vanished. I cant describe it well but if i were to take a laser pointer on scribble on the wall thats how fast it moved.  If anyone else saw this please post! so i know my wife and I are not going crazy!;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

We noticed a round object with numerous lights hovering over the capitol area which didn't look unlike a group of stars.   Then another circular object, same size and lighting structure very slowly pulled up next to it almost as if it were a satellite.   When they were next to each other the newer one sped up and was well in front of the first one, then sped off to the north at incredible speed.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
A shining green orb appearing suddenly in the sky in Madison, WI.;2015-04-24 05:23:00;5-6 seconds;A shining green orb appearing suddenly in the sky in Madison, WI. I was walking east down Williamson Street early in the morning.  I was just approaching the Yahara canal, when I witnessed a green luminescent appear suddenly in the sky over the condos on First Street.  It was about the size of a dime in an outstretched hand. It then moved fairly slowly in a North to South path at about a 40 degree angle to the horizon.  I could lost sight of it when it went behind the trees on the horizon. In the yard across the street, there was a dog that noticed the light too.  I didn't notice any dog before I saw the light, but it got up and ran to the property line after the object appeared.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

Looked like a round ball of fire changing colors red, white, orange, blue, moving very fast.  One went by then a minute later another then another.  When I zoomed in with my camera it looked like the sun.   Me and wife on our way home saw them at first I thought it was an airplane, but realized it was moving to fast.   We have never seen any kind of ufos before it was eerie.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Orange orb sighting at night that lasted about 5 minutes in Madison, Wisconsin.;2016-07-03 21:45:00;5 minutes;Orange orb sighting at night that lasted about 5 minutes in Madison, Wisconsin. The sighting took place at approximately 9:45pm on July 3, 2016 in Madison Wisconsin. I have never seen a UFO before but I sighted this one because I was looking for early firework displays.  Also, the night was particularly dark and visibility was crystal clear.  I could see several bright stars and at least two planets. While outside, I was enjoying constellations that I don’t normally see because the night sky was so dark that night.  I saw what I thought was a planet until I noticed that it was moving. It was an orange orb which was slowly moving across the sky.  I don’t believe it was a paper lantern that someone let go to celebrate the holiday because it was a perfect circle with a steady orange glow.  It stayed at the same altitude and speed as it flew over my head.  There was no sound. Since I was hoping to record a fireworks display, I had my camera ready to use.  I was able to film the orb from when I first notice it moving until it began quickly accelerating straight up until it went out of site.  There were no flashing lights, so it was not an airplane. Unfortunately, the recording showed no details and would not make good evidence.  I need to get a better camera for next time.  There will be a next time.
