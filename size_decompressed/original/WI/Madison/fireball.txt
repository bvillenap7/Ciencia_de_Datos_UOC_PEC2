When it went over the horizon, I waited for the sound of a crash which never came. I walked outside of my house just before 6:00 pm to walk the dog.  The sky was clear, dark and the air temp cool.  I noticed how starry the night was. About 10 seconds after walking outside I looked up straight up and saw this massive fireball with a long trail behind it.  My first instinct was it was some sort of a jet plane going down.  Although the airport is 5 - 7 miles away, planes from Milwaukee & Chicago fly over my neighborhood on their approach.  This plane was coming from what seemed to be SE and headed E/NE.  I thought that if it was a plane, it had taken off from the Madison airport to the SW, encountered problems and continued an arc that brought it E/NE and over my house.  Elevation seemed to be maybe 4000 feet and then as it headed towards the horizon & went over the trees, it looked like it was going to crash on the east side of town or in the village of Cottage Grove. The speed of the object was no faster than a plane making a landing approach.  It moved silently.  When I first noticed the fireball, it was directly overhead.  From that moment until it went over the tree horizon, about 45 seconds to maybe a minute went by.  It was long enough that I contemplated running to my next door neighboor's house to tell him to come out and watch this. After the object dissapered and I heard no explosion, I went on my walk with the dog (who by the way did not act strange during this event)all the while trying to figure out what I had just seen.  I knew about the upcoming meteor shower, but I thought that 1) it was so huge, I didn't know meteors looked like that 2) I thought the meteor shower was going to be in the middle of the night.  When I got home, I ran in the house & turned on the local news.  The Channel 3 weatherman was on and talking about the meteor shower.  Since I turned on the TV in the middle of talk, I missed most of what he said.  He was indicating however that the meteor shower was already starting & that was what people were seing.  He said (paraphrased), we've just had several calls about sightings, and that's what you're seeing folks - the meteor shower.  So that did it - I just assumed I saw a meteor. Then last night I turned on Art Bell, because I was curious to hear if he would talk about these impressive meteors.  Boy was I in for a surprise.  When you came on and played the tape from that lady in Northern Michigan, I nearly died.  It was incredibly similar to what I saw.  Like she said, it was moving slow enough to pull over and get out of a car.  Just incredible. To give you a bit of background - although open to the idea of UFOs and such, I have never seen anything which I would describe as unidentifiable until last night.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
greenish-bluish fireball like object streaking across NW sky.;2004-05-16 21:30:00;5 seconds;greenish-bluish fireball like object streaking across NW sky. Saw a greenish/blueish fireball type object in the North/Northwest part of the sky. Saw the object streaking across part of the sky I could see from a friends apartment window. Was not a meteor since this seemed alot bigger. Only saw it for a few seconds, when it went out of view from the particular window I was at. Should've gone outside to see it, but was too shocked. Time approximate, could've happened anywhere from 9-10pm central time.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Rolling ball of light/fire/gas fell to earth and then took off.;2009-10-05 01:45:00;20 seconds;Rolling ball of light/fire/gas fell to earth and then took off It was a little before 2 am and I was rushing to get home before my mother went to work because I had borrowed her car.  I was sober and wide awake because I was a 3rd shift worker at the time.  The streets were deserted as usual for this time of morning. I came to a stoplight at a 3 way intersection about 1 mile from my home.  When I came to a stop I quickly noticed something that looked as though it was falling from the sky.  I looked up to my left toward this ball of rolling light as it got closer and I was just in shock.  In seconds it “crashed” on and rolled across the hood of my car and continued to roll down onto the curb and onto the side walk where the color changed from this bright yellow color to a purple gaseous color.  It was still for maybe 2 seconds and then shot straight up into the night’s sky. The light turned green and I continued to sit at the stoplight looking up, waiting to see more, but I didn’t.  It just disappeared.  I probably sat there for! 4 or 5 minutes before slowly driving home. I couldn’t believe what I saw.  It was all I thought about that night. I only told one person, who thought I was crazy and from then on I kept my mouth shut about it.  But I still think about it and I still watch the sky, waiting to see it again.

2 fireball like spheres from the West head east over Madison, same as 08/18/12;2012-08-31 01:50:00;3-5 minutes;2 fireball like spheres from the West head east over Madison, same as 08/18/12 So, first off I want to say that this is my first time to ever research &quotUFO's&quot.  Once as a kid I thought maybe I taken a picture of one, but the picture was in fact a bead of water on my camera lens. I say that because I have also seen the fireballs that were previously talked about on the 18, same characteristics and everything.  Where I live, to be vague, is about an hour and a half from where the other group saw the same UFO's. Heading from the West towards the East, the first fireball came from the corner of my eye and looked as if it were a plane on fire, I freaked out thinking a plane was going down but there was no sound. I questioned what I saw.  Like the other group I thought chinese fire lamp, but this was to high for the brightness, then the second appeared.  Same direction the second ball of light came, the thought of a plane still was going, maybe a plane in half but again no sound. I got online and researched 'red light over wisconsin'. I found this site and to my findings I feel that the two of us saw the same thing.  Whether its extraterrestrial, I don't know, but take this entry as a validation that I too saw the same thing within 90 miles of the last viewing, heading back from the direction they (on 08/18/12) saw it going.

Red light hovering in sky over Lake Mendota, too high and could not be tower as it was over the lake, constant red light (no blinking);2013-01-07 17:45:00;2 minutes;Red light hovering in sky over Lake Mendota, too high and could not be tower as it was over the lake, constant red light (no blinking) I was stopped by the light at the Doty St/Wisconsin Ave. intersection facing Lake Mendota.  Saw red light hovering in sky straight ahead over Lake Mendota.  It was too high to be a tower with a light on it, and there is no tower there.  I've lived on that street and therefore know there's no tower there, and I've never seen any light there before.  It remained in the same place while I sat at the light.  It also did NOT twinkle or blink the light was constant.  Possibly a helicopter, but it was a very windy and somewhat snowy night.  I grew up 15 minutes from O'Hare Airport most of my life so I am aware of typical air traffic. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Three orange/red fireballs over Madison's West Side.;2013-08-03 21:55:00;20 minutes;Three orange/red fireballs over Madison's West Side. Was driving eastbound on the Beltline and clearly saw 2 fireballs hovering in the sky.  They were orange in the center and radiating red around the outside.  They were large compared to red lights from airplane towers in the background.  They were situated between the Capitol and the West Side.  I got off on Midvale where I picked up my husband.  We drove to an elementary school on Midvale where we stopped our car and got out to look.  At this point there were now 3 fireballs. 2 hovering next to each other, and one moving southwest very slowly toward Fitchburg/Verona.  They were fairly low (helicopter height), but made no noise and did not move except for the one traveling slowly.   We got back in our car to see if we could drive closer to them, got on the Beltline continuing toward the downtown area, and lost sight of them.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

One after another they moved along the same flight path.  The space between objects looked to be some significant amount of miles, though the last of them was flying under cumulonimbus clouds.   All appeared as a golden orange fireball.   One solo object of the very same nature was spotted at approximately the same time and flight path two weeks prior.

It had a meteor-like fireball with glowing tail appearance that increased in size and brightness as it moved through the sky on a steady linear route. It seemed to move slower than the usual misnamed shooting star of summers on the lake. Tonight's version was pretty and significant, but it was not a dramatic night-sky event.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
