V-shaped, 3-D, glowing fast moving silent craft.;2001-06-16 23:59:00;30 seconds;V-shaped, 3-D, glowing fast moving silent craft. Object appeared in Northeastern part of sky.  Object was V shaped, but obviously 3-dimensional.  It appeared to be lit from the inside with no lights on the outside of the 'craft', however it seemed to glow.  The color was a yellowish/light orange.  It was heading Southwest, crossing the sky very quickly, but making no sound.  The object didn't seem very high, maybe a few thousand feet, but it was difficult to determine since we had no idea what the actual size of the object was.  It definitely was not a plane (that we have ever seen), a hangglider (no one hangglides in Madison, WI at midnight), an ultralight (it was totally silent and way too fast) and it wasn't a balloon (again, way too fast);43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Triangular formation of what looked like stars in shape and bightness;2002-09-05 20:30:00;10 minutes;Triangular formation of what looked like stars in shape and bightness was looking at a constilation in center of the sky when 3 of the stars started moving to the southeast in an ununiform path until it disappeared into the light polution about a a third of the way up the eastern horizon.  there was no bliking or change in the light intensity.  during the movement there was no straying from the formation. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting was caused by the three satellites frequently seen flying in formation.  They are thought to be U. S. Navy NOSS satellites.  Please see other reports from Wisconsin for this date.  PD));43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Shape -changing brown tarp;2003-12-22 18:00:00;20 seconds;Shape -changing brown tarp I've finally decided to send this in after hearing of two other similar UFO descriptions in the last month on Unknowncountry.com.  One was about a dark-colored form changing parachute-like (not the round kind but the more oblong or oval ones) and the other a brownish jelly-fish like one that appeared to be swimming.  The one I saw, I at first thought to be a orangish brown tarp or plastic sheet or trash bag that had been blown up into the wind and was just blowing along while slowing undulating or changing shape as though made of a very light material.  And it very steadily traveled in its general direction, from north to south over the Isthmus/Willy St. area. (Unfortunately I did not think to check if it was actually going with the prevailing wind - though I do remember there being only a light wind that day.) It did not radically change shapes or take on any definite common shapes, but just stayed generally oblong (like the parachute story). The sky was clear and it was a around sunset so the object was fairly well lit.  However I had hard time focusing on it.  Sound-wise I heard nothing from it and the neighborhood was quiet.  It was about the size of my fingernail at arms length.  Moved right to left about a fist width every second or two.  I watched it for about ten seconds then it became obscured behind tree branches so I walked down the block about 40 ft to a clear view. But in the process I looked down for a second, and when I got to the clearing I could not find the object again. Very puzzling. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A black, parallelogram shaped object was seen on May 30, 2008.;2008-05-30 17:00:00;5-10 minutes;A black, parallelogram shaped object was seen on May 30, 2008. My sister and I had just picked up my daughter from a birthday party.  As we were driving into the neighborhood, we saw a large black object in the sky.  It was shaped kind of like a parallelogram.  It was completely still, no wavering, wind movement, etc.  When we got to my house we stood in the driveway and watched it for a few minutes.   Then it gradually moved out of our vision, behind a house high up on a hill.  It moved so slowly that it didn’t seem like it was moving, until the house was in the way.  We didn’t hear any sounds.  This was late in the afternoon, shortly before sunset.   We are still puzzled by what we saw.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Gold ring shaped UFO, silent.;2008-08-10 19:00:00;Several minutes;Gold ring shaped UFO, silent. Images here:   http://picasaweb.google.com/MichelleGsPhotos/WhatIs This  Friend saw this and followed it for quite a while. Took some great pictures of it. It looks like a perfect gold ring. I will updated when I get more information from him, but was genuinely curious. Thank you.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
Large L-shaped object with 9 red lights, not blinking,  moving slowly and silent from North to South very low in sky;2011-10-29 21:30:00;3 minutes;Large L-shaped object with 9 red lights, not blinking,  moving slowly and silent from North to South very low in sky Report of UFO Sighting on Saturday, October 29, 2011 at 9:30 p.m. in Madison, WI. I was driving home heading East on University Avenue on the West side of Madison.  I had my sunroof open.  I am a birder so I always have a pair of binoculars on my dash.   As a was coming down the road on a slight hill just before the state office building (Hill Farms) on the right, and the golf course (Blackhawk CC)  that begins on the left I saw a large object very low in the sky just ahead and to my left about where the Pyre Square Building and McDonalds are located.   At first I thought some helicopters were probably moving some large item but as I got closer it was not.  It was totally silent.  I quickly cross over three lanes of traffic to turn right onto Segoe Road to pull over and watch the object.  I grabbed my binoculars to look at it through my open sunroof.  As I was looking at one of the red lights the entire object just plain disappeared, no light , no anything.   I then spent the next 45 minutes driving around the west side of Madison trying to find it again and ! to find a good unobstructed viewing area.  It was so obvious that I saw something that when I got home I turned the news on since I assumed everyone would have seen it.  There was nothing on the news, nothing in the newspapers - I kept checking for a week or so. What the object looked like was a very large L-shaped thing with red lights on each of the corners.  I assume the reason most people did not see it is that just down the road a mile are many, many red lights on top of the building cranes at the construction sight by University Hospital, in addition to the red lights on top of University Hospital for the helicopter pad (Med-Flight).  So there are twenty plus red lights ahead in the sky as you drive down this road.  But all the red lights there on the hospital and on the cranes blink!   I am always looking up in the sky since I often see owls in flight at night..  I also spend many hours star gazing with either my binoculars or my spotting scope.  I always can see satellites crossing in the sky.  Recently I have been seeing movement in the sky that I do not think are satellites.  These star like objects are much brighter and move way more quickly and straighter that the satellites.  They have been moving from north-east to south, south-west.  I regularly spend many hours at night watch the stars.  About 13 years ago I was up in the Apostle Islands when star gazing one night I found three very small bright star like objects that were arranged in a triangular shape and kept moving around in perfect sequence in the triangular shape.  I kept viewing this sighting for over an hour.  They were very, very far away.  I know other people have seen this kind of sighting.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
I think I saw a normal looking passenger jet in the air that wasn't moving.;2017-03-15 20:35:00;30 seconds;I think I saw a normal looking passenger jet in the air that wasn't moving I was driving north on Highway 51 just north of Madison, WI, at the intersection of Highway 51 and Windsor Rd.  This is about 4 Miles north of Dane County Regional Airport.   It was 8:30 at night and it was dark out.  What I'm pretty sure I saw was a normal passenger type jet at the same height it would be as if it were coming in for a landing at the Dane county airport, but it wasn't moving.   I thought it might be a helicopter at first, but as I got closer I thought it was much to big to be a helicopter, and when I got right next to it I could swear the shape was of a passenger jet and I could see the two jet engines under the wings.  It had some red and white lights that were steady, and some red and white lights that were blinking.   Nothing really seemed out of place except for the fact that it wasn't moving.  I had it in sight for about 30 seconds I guess as I drove up to it and passed it.   I turned around at the next exit a few miles down the road and drove back to see if it was still there, but it was gone by that time.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
