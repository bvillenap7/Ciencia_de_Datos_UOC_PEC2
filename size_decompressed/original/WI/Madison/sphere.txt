This was actually the first of two times I have seen this strange light. Both times there were other witnesses besides myself with me. We were eating pizza outside in my front yard.  We live in an area where there isn’t much light pollution, so we were looking at stars.  We were trying to find constellations we knew, when two of us (myself and one of my friends) saw the light.  We told them to look as we watched it. The object first appeared to be star, which we then noticed was slowly moving.  It had been fairly faint, but still noticeable.  We hadn’t been paying attention until it started moving.  It was in the north north-eastern sky and was slowly moving towards the south east.  As it moved it got somewhat faster, but also significantly brighter.  It got bright enough that it rivaled some of the other stars, but I wouldn’t say it :lit up the sky, or anything that significantly.  As it continued to travel, it started getting dimmer and dimmer until it couldn’t be seen.  I wouldn’t say it traveled very fast, and it never got far enough to be parallel with us/over us (though its path wouldn’t have allowed it go over us).  It was a clear enough night that had it been a plane we could have seen something as it continued further.  There was no flashing or sound the light was white like any other star. There were three guys (counting myself) and two girls.  We were in high school. Nobody had been drinking, or doing any drugs of any sort.  Everybody saw it clearly and agreed that we couldn’t figure out what it was.  (We are good students too one of the guys is our class’s valedictorian in a class of over 250) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
