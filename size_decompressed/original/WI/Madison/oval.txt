White oval above treetops in Madison, WI - changed direction and color;2008-06-23 14:15:00;15 minutes;White oval above treetops in Madison, WI - changed direction and color From my office window, on the East side of Madison, Wisconsin, I had just watched a flight of F-16 fighter jets make their landing approaches to the Dane County Regional Airport when I looked around to see if any other aircraft were approaching.  Less than 2 minutes later, I saw, to the North, a white, but slightly yellowish oval approaching the airport just above the treetops. The oval was horizontal to the horizon. From the size, I judged it to be an approaching airliner a long way off, but one that seemed too far away to have been on its glide path that early. It wavered laterally and vertically just slightly, as it approached (these changes in position were slow and gradual). I estimate it was about a half mile out from the runway when it appeared to slow down. As it grew darker- to a grayish color – and very slowly shrunk in size, I realized that it had changed course and was traveling almost due Northwest. I could still see it bob and weave – but very faintly as it drifted off. I was on the phone with a Dane County Sheriff’s dispatcher as the object finally dropped below the treetops and I could see it no more. The object reminded me of a 20 – 30 foot Mylar balloon mimicking an ultra light aircraft in a moderate wind. The dispatcher said she would notify the Sheriff’s Office in DeForest – the town over which I estimated it was when I lost sight of it. A coworker was the only other witness.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585

3 high altitude redish purple lights that moved oddly across the nights sky.;2010-10-06 08:38:00;3 seconds;3 high altitude redish purple lights that moved oddly across the nights sky. Talking with a friend, standing outside looking up.  Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw a search light streatch up from behind the top of a large tree. Upon looking directly, I realized it was 3 oval redish purplish lights in a straight line up and down but instantly they took a 45 deg.  Turn, but maintained their distance and relation to each other and sped off quickly to the east & disapeared into the sky.;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
hovering object with bright lights in sky- suddenly disappears;2011-01-10 18:35:00;15 seconds;hovering object with bright lights in sky- suddenly disappears Riding in car with 17 year old daughter, turned corner and my daughter said do you see what I see  I had seen lights out of the corner of my eye, I looked up and in the sky right in front of us was an aircraft with green and white lights in an oval shape.  I suddenly sped up because I started thinking in was something stuck in the power lines cuz it made no logical sense the way it was hovering.  I felt like something was going to fall on us or suck us up.   I drove past 2 or 3 houses on the street and pulled into a driveway  to look back at it and it was gone.  I turned and drove back under where it was because I couldn't believe it and there was nothing in the sky;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
