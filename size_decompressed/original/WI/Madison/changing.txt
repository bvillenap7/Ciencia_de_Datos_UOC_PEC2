madison wi, west side;2005-08-27 19:30:00;15 minutes;madison wi, west side The UFO was about a half mile away, what we seen was a black tube like object floating in the same place then after five minutes it started to move slowly to the left and turned a little bit and when it did that, it tuned to a tear drop shape ( fat and rounded at one end and pointed at the other) then stoped again. It stayed in the same spot for about a minute then turned again to a tube shape and kept going slowly.

It didn't change shape (but that is not a choice given) it didn't have any distinct geometric shape, but looked like a larger cap with a dangling down piece.   It appeared to move with the wind and not under any power.  If I had to guess I would have said it was a mostly deflated balloon with the helium in the top part and the bottom dangly part uninflated.   I first thought it was a parachutist, but when it got closer it was obviously not and it was  traveling horizontally, not down;43.0632441039317;-89.360211947585
