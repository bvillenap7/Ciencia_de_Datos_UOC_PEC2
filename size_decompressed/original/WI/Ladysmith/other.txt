But, I had saw this same exact thing a little over a month ago also in same area.  It always looks like smoke from a jet, but it doesn't dissipate, it just moves along in a strange manner.  One second its in front of you, a few seconds later, it is behind you.  I did gets pics of it on my phone, and this time, I told 2 other people at a convienance store to step out and look.  They saw 2 objects as well.;45.4716;-91.1045000000001
