I was taking picture of the cloud formations because they were weird that night.  I remember the time because it was near sunset (hence the colors in the sky)when my husband and i went outside outside in my backyard to take the pictures.  (He took some 35 mm pics that i havent had developed yet.)  Anyhow, I didnt see anything irregular in the sky because I was looking at the clouds not at anything else.  (We were sending pictures to our local weather guy so that he could see what we saw.) I didnt see anything odd in the sky until I looked at the picture.  I took them at all angles, some from a higher distance, (on top of a piece of playground equipment) some from a lower distance.  This picture was taken lower as you can tell from the heighth of the cornfield.  This one is the only one that has this object in it....I showed it to my husband and he thought it was a plane or something of the like, because there is a small airport located not too far from there, but the clouds were so low that no plane would have been flying under them, and I dont know of any diamond shaped planes.;42.6914394265233;-89.0442311827958
