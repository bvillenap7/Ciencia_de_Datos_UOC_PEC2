I was at work and we were outside taking a break when I saw a giant flash of light in the sky it was 50 times bigger then any star in the sky and lasted about 2 or 3 seconds. At around 02:00 am I was looking up in the sky where I saw the flash and an object that at first I thought was a shooting star was flying across the sky at a high rate of speed it took about 5 to 7 seconds to cross the entire sky. We were sitting at a picnic table facing ESE when an incredible huge flash of light appeared 2 of the 3 of us saw it and tried to figure what it could have been. It was bright white and seemed orange/red in the middle it was probably two thirds the size of the moon it lasted about two to three seconds and was gone. About ten to fifteen minutes later I was scaning the sky about where I saw the light when out of the south west an object traveling at an unbeleivable pace crossed the sky heading northeast it took about five to seven seconds to cross the sky I watched it until it disappeared . It was what I thought to be a falling star based on the speed and the color but it didnt burn out like a falling star it just kept going.;42.6914394265233;-89.0442311827958
On our deck on the outskirts of Janesville, we observed one flashing object.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2011-02-02 18:20:00;at least 15 min;On our deck on the outskirts of Janesville, we observed one flashing object.  It looked sort of like a flashing star.  It looked to flash from blue to red to green and white.  It wasnâ€™t very big and seemed to go on like that longer than 15 minutes. It was too still to be an airplane or weather balloon we think.;42.6914394265233;-89.0442311827958
