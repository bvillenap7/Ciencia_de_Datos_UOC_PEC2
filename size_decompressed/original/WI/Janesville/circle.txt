Green ball of light as bright as a flare decending in an arch towards ground as light slowly went out as it fell.   This is my second encounter.  Last summer we seen similiar ball of green light through our blinds.   Jumped up looked through window seen it descend and burn out over field around same location.   We live roughly a block from location of both sightings both seem to be over corn fields.;42.6914394265233;-89.0442311827958
