Stationary, solid, white cylinder floating 20-40 feet above a building.;2017-12-31 12:32:00;2 minutes;Stationary, solid, white cylinder floating 20-40 feet above a building. Saw a white cylindrical object with a dark band around the middle (possibly an indented band with the dark coloring being shadow).  Was floating above a store, saw it while I was driving.  Watched it for maybe two minutes until I'd gone too far to see it anymore. When I first saw it I saw it from the front, directly ahead of me, and saw that it was cylindrical in shape.  As I got farther I saw it was round on the side, confirming the cylindrical shape. It stayed completely stationary.  Somewhat windy day, NW 11 mph. 8 degrees outside and nearly completely clear skies.  The object was maybe 20-40 feet above the building, can't remember what store.  I think it was on Black Bridge Road, perhaps. I was a little too shocked to take photos or even mention it to the other passengers unfortunately, but I will email illustrations.  Observer background: I grew up in Wisconsin. I was previously a mechanical engineering student in Boston, Massachusetts, now I'm an illustration student in Missouri.;42.6914394265233;-89.0442311827958
