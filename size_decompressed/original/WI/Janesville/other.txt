I was hanging upside down on playground equipment at a parochial school. I saw twinkling objects in the Northwest sky. I thought i had been upside down too long. but when i regained my balance they were still there. I contacted my school principal. He told me he would call the proper authorities. Everyone on the playground seen it. there were a multitude of twinkling lights way up in the sky. all silver. very small but yet visibly shining. there was also an airplane coming in from the southwest, it went behind a cloud and there was a loud explosion. I never saw the plane come back out of the cloud. nor did i see anything fall out of the sky. My principal got back to me and told me the airforce had checked out the lights. I was told it was just tinfoil in the sky. I never saw any report on this incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is unknown to the witness.

((HOAX??))  Crescent shaped craft with seven evenly spaced orange lights in the backside. ((anonymous report));2016-11-29 18:20:00;10 seconds;crescent shaped craft with seven evenly spaced orange lights in the backside. I was in my driveway, waiting for my ride to work.  I was looking up at the stars and thinking it was nice to see the stars for once, since I live in town with a few lights that usually hinder the sight of them.  Then just like out of a  movie!  Something seemed to shimmer into existence...I want to say about half a mile up.  It was crescent shaped with what appeared to have seven engines.  Then it darted to the Northeastern direction with no sound at a speed I cant even guess. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
