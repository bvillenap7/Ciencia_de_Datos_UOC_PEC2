Orange sphere in Janesville, WI moving North, then NNE.;2011-08-17 21:00:00;2 Minutes;Orange sphere in Janesville, WI, moving North, then NNE. My wife and I were standing outside, she was watering and I was on the phone with my brother.  We saw an orange sphere moving north across the sky, it stopped, and then turned east-northeast before disappearing.  I hung up on my brother so I could take a video on my phone, but unfortunately it didn't come out very well.  The sphere was totally silent, and it was much brighter than anything else in the sky.;42.6914394265233;-89.0442311827958
Bright white sphere with geometrical points surrounding and within circle.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2015-10-25 00:30:00;30 minutes;Bright white sphere with geometrical points surrounding and within circle, generating energy between points, seen in NW sky at night. White sphere in NW sky, seen several times at various hours of the night during past month.  First appeared as the brightest and biggest star or planet in that direction.  Caused us to view through a spotting scope when the object slowly moved up and down and left and right.  When magnified, the object appeared outlined in white with geometric bright points throughout the body of the sphere.  Energy waves pass between these points and also around the sphere.  Colors within the body appear blue and pinkish-orange.  Have depicted the sphere on clear star-filled nights and watched it hover around for 30 minutes and more.  It appears far away, but always sighted in the same direction.  After watching for some period of time, the object disappears and sometimes will reappear later on in the late evening or early morning.  Have seen it as early as 7:30 pm as well as after midnight and 2 and 3 am.  It seems to generate a strong energy within its circle.  It appears larger when sinking closer to the ground.

Ufo seen by 5 witnesses.;2016-07-04 21:30:00;90 minutes;Ufo seen by 5 witnesses Our nieghbors and I were watching the fire works above Traxler Park, Janesville, from our sidewalk and saw a craft come toward the park from the north to south slowly, then zip quickly to the south of the park about the same elevation, then stopped and was stationary for about 15 minutes, then zipped up, down, then left, then up again, then remained stationary again for about 30 minutes.  Then zipped up to the right very quickly, then down, then stationary again until fireworks ended.  Then the craft quickly zoomed east downward and out of sight.  Took pictures and video..;42.6914394265233;-89.0442311827958
8 orange spheres in a random dispersion with an additional one a distance away catching up with the others.;2019-04-24 20:45:00;10 minutes;8 orange spheres in a random dispersion with an additional one a distance away catching up with the others. Nine ornage orbs located East, North - East of Janesville, Wisconsin.  Eight appeared to be in a random figure with one quite a distance in the South that was moving faster to catch up with the group.  They appeared to be about 60 degrees off the horizon.  They eventually moved in a group North and after 10 minutes disappeared into the night.  They were as orange as the fruit and moved in synch with each other.;42.6914394265233;-89.0442311827958

Then I got a better view and there were actually four red orange lights making a equal square shape.  Then the bottom right started moving very quickly and very close to the bottom left light.  They stayed like that flying close for a few mins.  Once I got outside they were in a straight line with a fifth one coming up faster from the distance as the others were one by one dissapearing into the clouds I guess.  The fourth light seemed to almost slow down to wait for the fifth light.;42.6914394265233;-89.0442311827958
02/11/20  19:30  Janesville, Wisconsin 5 orange spheres maneuvering in the night sky then disappeared.;2020-02-11 19:30:00;3 minutes;02/11/20  19:30  Janesville, Wisconsin 5 orange spheres maneuvering in the night sky then disappeared. I was driving south on Harmony Town Hall road between Rotamer and Wilcox roads approximately 3 miles northeast of Janesville, Wisconsin.  The sky was dark and clear, visibility was unlimited and the stars were shining brightly.  My wife and I both noticed two groups of bright lights in the sky which appeared to be similar to aircraft flying in formation.  The unusual thing was the color, all 5 objects were round and solid orange in color.  I am a pilot and very familiar with aircraft lighting, there were no visible navigation lights (red or green) nor any white strobe lights.  I pulled over to the side and stopped near the Wilcox road intersection. Despite the temperature being around 20 degrees (F) we opened the front seat windows and moon roof window to reduce internal light reflection in order to see clearly.  One group of 3 lights was at our 2 o’clock position moving to the left (eastbound).  The other group of 2 lights were at our 1 o’clock position moving in the same direction.  At arm’s length I probably would relate all of the lights size to that of a BB that was bright orange.  The two orange lights at our 1 o’clock position maneuvered unlike any flight formation would.  The trailing light, which was to the right following the lead light, sped up and appeared to either pass through or around the other and it became the lead light still heading east.  As they continued eastbound, the lights dimmed until they disappeared.  The following group of three, continued moving east and two of the three lights dimmed in intensity and disappeared, leaving one light visible which by now was just about over the top of our ! van.  With the moon roof open, we could not hear any sound from the light.  As it passed over, it accelerated to an incredible speed and disappeared towards the east horizon in a matter of two or three seconds. I could not guess what the exact altitude might have been of any of the objects, but my guess would be based on the angle in relation to the horizon when we first noticed them, I would say maybe around 3,000 feet.  The distance that last one covered would probably have taken a commercial airliner at altitude probably 5 minutes or more to cover.   I am a licensed private pilot and worked for 4 years as an air traffic control specialist (tower) at one time.  I since have retired from many years in manufacturing management.  I am very familiar with the different types of aircraft but have never seen anything like what I saw tonight.  The other witness, my wife is a registered nurse.;42.6914394265233;-89.0442311827958
