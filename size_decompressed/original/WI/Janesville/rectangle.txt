I have lived in Janesville for 37 years I know it very well in daylight and nighttime. I was walking home one night in the month of october or september. I lived near the downtown circuit at the time. I always admired the city lights on the east side of the river at night. one evening I noticed colorful lights in the sky it was not very cloudy as i looked I could not believe my eyes. The ship was as large as 1 or 2 city blocks or maybe 2-3 football fields in length. Lights were everywhere on this ship. I could make out a definite rectangular shape looking at the lights. It was moving from the north to the south. not very fast but not very slow either. The lights were not reflections, i saw red green yellow blue. It might have been about fifty feet in height and width. I came closer to my house and then it was gone. I told a few people but no one believed me. I would guess it to be about 1500 ft. in altitude. there is no way I was seeing reflections. There was no sound from the craft. I too wonder if there is a secret military base here in town as a previous U.F.O. report states. I have come to the conclusion that what I saw was of Holographic Design.
