6 lights very close to each other moving on the same path at the same speed. ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-16 18:55:00;45 seconds;6 lights very close to each other moving on the same path at the same speed. Looked very similar to satellites. I’m an avid star watcher, and tonight I witnessed something I’ve never seen before. What I saw looked exactly like what you would see when a satellite flys overhead, except this time there were 6 of them all moving on the exact same path very close to each other moving from west to east. They were all moving at a constant speed going about the same speed as satellites.  These could very well be satellites, except I’ve never known satellites to travel this close together and all moving in the exact same direction.  I tried to take a video of it, but my camera on my phone wouldn’t pick up the lights on the sky. The event lasted around 45 seconds before the lights started to fade below the horizon line.;44.61;-87.46
