Strange orange light west of Algoma.;2015-03-21 19:20:00;10 minutes;Strange orange light west of Algoma Saw an orange light slowly moving from the sky towards the ground in a straight line to the west of Algoma, WI.  I viewed the light through a pair of binoculars and it looked like a fireball.  After ten minutes it disappeared beyond the horizon line. When I entered my house there was a static charge when I turned on the light switch.  This could be coincidental, but does not usually happen.;44.61;-87.46
