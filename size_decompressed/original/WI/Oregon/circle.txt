Several slow moving orangish circular lights in the sky.;2012-09-21 20:00:00;Hour;Several slow moving orangish circular lights in the sky. I was leaving my house to go to the store around 20:00 when I noticed 5 orange circular lights(Double the size of whats on a plane) in the sky just south of town.  They were moving real slow, and they kinda spread out but looked like they were still flying together.  The store was just down the road so I went in and did my business which lasted about 10-15 min.  On my way back into the neighborhood I noticed a lot of cars driving funny and I looked up and saw like 6 more lights. The people driving were following and watching these lights too.  I drove around the neighborhood and saw all sorts of people watching from their cars or standing in their driveway.  I stopped at a stop sign to get a better look and I noticed the lights looked like they were glowing or had a haze around them. at that stop sign I talked to this lady who was taking pictures of the lights and she said she had counted 17 of these lights.  It all lasted in under a hour.  Immediately came home and googled these orange lights and tons of stuff popped up (This site was the top link).  I watched the top 2 youtube video links that were given,and both videos were identical to what I had seen tonight.;42.9298;-89.3898
