Five streaks of light that were too bright and too constant to be meteorites and too fast for a satelite or aircraft.;2002-07-03 23:30:00;20 seconds;Five streaks of light that were too bright and too constant to be meteorites and too fast for a satelite or aircraft. I saw a series of light streaks similiar to a meteorite but of constant duration and substantially more intense in brightness and their speed was slower than a typical meteorite.  I saw five bursts of light in total running approximately north to south.  The duration of the sighting is not exactly known, but I'm guessing that the whole series lasted less than 60 seconds.  The spacing between the flashes covered approximately 10 degrees of sky (one fist width = 10 degrees)the flashes approximately 10 degrees.  The first four bursts of light were in a straight line.  When I saw the second one I thought that something was bouncing in and out of the atmosphere.  I dismissed this idea when I realized that their intensity was constant.  I would have come away from the experience and probably soon forgotten it except that the fifth flash of light appeared at a angle of about 45 degrees from the path of the first four heading in a southwesterly direction.  The wind was calm, skys were clear, seeing was about 6.  If this was some sort of conventional aircraft I would like to know about it.;45.5437;-92.0321
