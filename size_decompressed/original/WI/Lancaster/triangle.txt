When I went to get my camera I fell and broke 3 toes. I dident want to turn the lites on .I went to the door and it looked difrent. At that time it was a brite blue white but must have been further away. The object was brite but U could see that the top and bottem were flat. I do have a little video of it at this point.Mike;42.8445;-90.7025
