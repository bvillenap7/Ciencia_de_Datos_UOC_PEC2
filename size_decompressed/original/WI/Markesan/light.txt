Driving home, noticed brighter than a normal light in sky.  It was dark out and the stars were shining.  The light was kind of oval and came on and then went off.   Then a little ways to the right another light of same shape and size came on and went off.  Then another and another.  In a pattern, 4 total.  If a star looks like the size of a nail head these looked more like a small plate that is used under a coffee cup.   The lights were not real white, but more amber in color.  I waited a little and the same thing happened but they seemed a little farther away.  These lights kept going on and off for a while.   After they stopped I continued on my way home.  I turned the corner and kept my eyes on my rear view mirror.   I looked out to the west of the car and the lights were back.  I stopped the car and watched as they did the same thing, but this time one of them turned on and there were about 4 other lights in the same area.  The lights did this for at least 5 minutes.;43.714;-89.007
