Rock/triangle shaped objects in the sky;2013-01-05 22:00:00;5 minutes;Rock/triangle shaped objects in the sky Me and my girlfriend were laying outside at about 10:00 pm looking at the stars until we saw a triangle shaped object zip through the sky.  It was very fast but slow enough to be able to see it.  It had 3 red lights on each corner.  We saw it twice. It flew a little slower than a shooting star.  It was about 1000 feet up in the sky.  We were amazed to see them so we observed for about 3 more minutes until we saw a rock type object glide through the sky about the same speed as an airplane but it was really close. (400-500 feet) we were looking at it for abou a minute until my girlfriend got scared and wanted to go inside.  It was definitely not any type of aircraft we've eve seen before.;43.714;-89.007
