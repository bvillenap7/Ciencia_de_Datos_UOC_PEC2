Thought I saw a plane over the lake with blinking red, white,green lights.  watched for several minutes but didn't move.  It was north west.  Sitting on side of road I saw a slow moving, I thought was a plane.   As it went over head I noticed 2 white lights and one red.  It was a black triangle shape with the lights at each angle slowly went over head.  It was travelling with the broad end first.  Still believing it to be a plane I cont to watch.  When it got close to the other blinking lights it stopped..  I watched another 5 minutes believing it to be a plane but it just sat there unmoving.   I finally had to go home and lost sight.;42.8074;-88.4043000000001
