We were going East on Layton Ave toward the Lake.  We saw four orange lights in the distance that were in a row.   As we got closer to the lake they formed a straight line. We ran to the lake front and watched two disappear but two remained together.  They got extremely close and my son said he saw flashing from one and a flashing response from the other.   One then just disappeared backward and one went up and down the lake front then started to go backward and flashed as it disappeared.   I did take my I-phone out and took some footage.  Our neighbors were on their porches and took off in the car I believe to take better pictures.;42.9464;-87.8539
