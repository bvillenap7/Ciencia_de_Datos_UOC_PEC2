Red glowing hovering object observed for three minutes by three people in Cudahy, Wisconsin;2013-08-10 21:00:00;3 minutes;Red glowing hovering object observed for three minutes by three people in Cudahy, Wisconsin We three were sitting on our neighbor's patio when the red glowing object was spotted in the northern sky.  Since we had just returned from a car show, I still had my camera with me and caught it hovering silently. It was early evening, just getting dark, when the object appeared.  It glowed red and hovered, moving slightly, then stopping again.  After a minute or so, it veered off to our left, westward, then stopped and hovered some more. At the end of the sighting, the object moved upward, hovered again, then the light went out, as if someone blew out a candle.  It did not leave our view by going east, west, up or down, it simply disappeared. About 15 minutes later, the red glowing object reappeared, and I filmed it again, this time with a darker sky, making it harder to see. Here is the youtube video I posted of the event:  http://youtu.be/xR9dZ8t_XcY;42.9464;-87.8539
