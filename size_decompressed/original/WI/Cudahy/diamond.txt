At first I thought it was a star, but then it started to move around in weird ways.  I know that no aircraft could possibly maneuver.   Then I saw a diamond shaped orange light pattern with four dots like it was giving off a signal.  Few moments later in a straight diagonal line flashing lights really fast of of the colors red green orange blue and white.  Then it went back to the orange diamond pattern for a few minutes then took off following that same pattern to the right then down then left and straight up out of sight.
