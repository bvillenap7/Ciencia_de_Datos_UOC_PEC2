Lighted sphere traveling southwest.;2015-09-27 04:38:00;2 minutes;Lighted sphere traveling southwest. I observed what was believed to be a star and as soon as I started watching it it started moving southwest (over Lake Michigan).  It wasn't  really fast and appeared to shuffle left to right a little bit instead of flying in a straight line.;42.9464;-87.8539
