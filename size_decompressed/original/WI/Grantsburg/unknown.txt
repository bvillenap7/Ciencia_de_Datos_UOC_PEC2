Hovering Blinking Dot and Red flashes on the ground;2013-01-09 05:30:00;10 minutes;Hovering Blinking Dot and Red flashes on the ground I was in bed looking across my bedroom outside my sliding glass door which faces the west, and I noticed a bright blinking dot above the woods.  It would blink from red to white, and occasionally blue. I stared at it for awhile and noticed it was moving in a figure 8 formation-not exactly, but very similar. I watched for about 5 minutes, thinking that my eyes were just playing tricks on me.  Then, a green light flew up from the woods, and two bright red and HUGE flashes of light seemed to drop from the green light into the woods.  It circled around the first dot I noticed, and then disappeared. Then, the first dot faded away slowly, headed north.;45.7986;-92.704
