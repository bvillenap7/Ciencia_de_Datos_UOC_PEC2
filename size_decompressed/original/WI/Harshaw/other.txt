To best describe it,it was like an oblong diamond) glide by approx. say 50' to 100' above tree lines. The object glided very fast from west to east, it lasted for only a few seconds.  The object was way faster than any plane.  It was low,and I never heard a sound.   It was the weirdest thing I have ever seen in my life. The night sky was very dark in the background.;45.6761;-89.652
