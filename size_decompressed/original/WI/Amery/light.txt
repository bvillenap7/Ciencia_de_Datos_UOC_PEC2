Lights thought to be satellites making impossible movements;2011-05-03 23:30:00;hours;Lights thought to be satellites making impossible movements I just got off work and was smoking in the dark in the back yard. It was extremely clear last night. I always watch for satellites.  It's a fun thing I like to do. I noticed a satellite coming from roughly north north west moving south south east.  As it was coming by I noticed another going the opposite direction.  This is when it got weird.  The second satellite slowed down, I could actually see it swoop around and tail the other back.  Then both satellites stopped mid air at stand off distances from each other.   I woke up my girlfriend after I found out my camera will not take night video or photo.  I thouhgt it may be helicopters but I could hear no rotor chop and a helicopter at the altitude they appeared to be at??  I don't think so.  Also Harrier jets cannot hover very long before there engines overheat.  Very strange.  Even more strange is the one further north didn't move hardly at all after it stopped but the one further south kept on swooping around and stopping and hovering, like it was taunting the other.  Finally I had to go to bed but this went on for an hour before I went inside.  I assume it kept going on after I went in.  Frickin weird.  Do you guys have an idea what we seen in the sky last night??;45.3525;-92.4027000000001
They are still here! Two days!;2011-05-05 11:41:00;constant!;They are still here!  Two days! THEY ARE STILL HERE!  It was cloudy last night, but I kid you not they are still hovering out there as I write this email.  I mailed just two days ago about seeing them and thinking they were satellites until they stopped and started making smooth s turns in a tight circle, which I can look out the door and see, yes they are still freeking there?  I am going to try to get a neighbor outside if i can or maybe even contact the police to come look at it.  We are not crazy, there are two of somethings that still look like a satellite there moving around!;45.3525;-92.4027000000001
Two star-like objects moving in erratic formations.;2014-08-07 22:00:00;3 seconds;Two star-like objects moving in erratic formations. I was out late one night at Bible camp with my cabin.  We were at the beach around the campfire.   I looked up at the stars and saw two moving objects.  They looked exactly like the rest of the stars, except that they were moving in erratic formations.  They were moving slowly, and seemed to stop or turn on a whim.  They did not make any noise.   While doing their formation, they glided down to the left, where a tree was blocking my vision.  I did not catch sight of them afterwards. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the date, to reflect a nighttime sighting.
