F-16's chasing object;1999-02-02 02:00:00;40 seconds;F-16's chasing object Madison has a Ait Guard unit, equipped with F-14 or F-16, I live on a farm 20 miles southwest from Madison, I heard a loud noise outside (like a thunder type noise) I got outside, I was standing on my deck when I saw two I guess what were the fighters (could see the flames comming out the ends of them(afterburner), they were chasing a bright orange something, I guess it could be described as a orange cloud or distortion, this lasted for about 40 seconds, then it was all quiet. I saw the planes leaving in a south west direction. I called the Air Guard tower in Madison, and they said there was no flight activity that night, by them or Volk Field, or Mc.Coy. It was definately strange.;43.0049;-89.7395
