I was standing at a boat landing watching eagles soar, so my eyes were on the sky.  Movement caught my eye.  When I focused on it, I saw 3 spherical objects.  They looked exactly like a bubble blown by a child, but they were clearly very high in the sky.  Higher than the eagles.  They flew at a steady rate in a triangular formation, one in the lead and two slightly behind on either side.  They looked transparent but shiny.  I watched them until their transparency made it impossible to find them any longer.;44.8001;-89.6863000000001
