My husband and I were driving on County GG near Coloma, Wisconsin and at approximately 5:50 PM we saw 6 horizontal, evenly spaced lights appear in the sky.  They appeared low in the sky and reminded us of stadium lights but in a horizontal pattern as I described.  We both asked, what is that? and they immediately went dark.  Within seconds, we stopped the car, turned off the engine and got out to listen.  There was no sound.  We expected a plane, helicopter or something, but it was silent. This is a rural, county road. There are no trees, etc. or other visual obstructions where we were.  The only other traffic was a truck 1/4 mile ahead of us that appeared oblivous to this.  There are no towers, city lights or nearby airport. My husband and I have lived in this area for 30 years.  We are both retired teachers.  I am 51 and my husband is 62 and have never seen anything like this.  This is the first time I have ever reported something like this.;44.0303;-89.4983
