3 linear yellow lights over Coloma, Wisconsin;2004-09-22 21:00:00;seconds x 2;3 linear yellow lights over Coloma, Wisconsin Aproximately 2100hrs as I was driving north on HWY 51 toward Coloma with a passenger. We saw 3 yellow gold lights at the cloud layer. (Thin light very broken cloud layer with stars visible through openings). The 3 linear lights were desending at an angle and then rotated quickly north.(?? 10-15 seconds)Appeared to be just north of Coloma just east of HWY 51. The lights re-appeared a couple minutes later and did some very tight rotations staying linear (again appeared near the bottom of the cloud layer)then disappeared. (?? 5 seconds) I quickly stopped on the off ramp to Coloma shut the car off got out and listened. There was no jet or engine noise but visually the lights were gone. This is a large MOA area. The flight pattern could only be described as very extreme.;44.0303;-89.4983
