Bright lights on cylindrical object viewed leaving atmosphere at high rate of speed;2008-03-07 17:55:00;30 seconds;Bright lights on cylindrical object viewed leaving atmosphere at high rate of speed I feel a little odd writing this, as I never thought that I would encounter anything of this type in my lifetime, but I am hopefully seeking others who may have legitimately witnessed this occurrence to prove the sanity of my wife and I both. At 5:55 PM CST my wife and I were walking when we saw what appeared to be a straight horizontal line at a 45 degree angle from where we stood emitting a bright white light with a soft red-like center.  It initially looked like a series of abnormally bright stars strung together to make this bright line.  The sighting appeared to be within 5-10 miles of where we were at the time.  Within the following 20 seconds we saw the item rise slowly into the sky yet diminish in size rather quickly, as if it were moving away from us.  The object produced no audible sound, no smoke or trails.  Within the 20 second duration the object simply vanished as if it left our atmosphere.  The sky was clear without a single cloud in the sky.;43.0537999999998;-88.3976000000002
