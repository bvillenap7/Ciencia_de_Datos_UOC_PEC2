The three of us were leaving a small bonfire and driving back to our respectives houses, when we saw the formation of five spherical shapes in the sky.  There seemed to be no lights, rather they were lights.  There were two cars between the three of us, and we both pulled over, thinking we were wittnessing some kind of air trafic emergency.  There was one main object, big, with two smaller objects flanking each side.  There was no noise, and they appeared to be motionless in the air.   After observing them for about seven minutes, the objects zoomed away for no aparent reason.  They seemed to be right above the treeline.   We are not sure what we witnessed.;43.0537999999998;-88.3976000000002
