Fading light moving along the sky over Grant County, Wisconsin.;2013-07-18 22:32:00;5 minutes;Fading Light moving along the sky over Grant county Wisconsin. Went outside for a smoke, looked up and saw what i thought was a satellite, by how bright it was (very dim), heading straight north.   I blocked the street lights with my hands and the object got about as bright as the brightest star for an instant... then faded... all while moving... then faded out completely.   So I'm thinking either a satellite with the light hitting it just right or a meteor.   But the thing lit back up where it had dimmed and then continued moving north again.   The object grew brighter, not as bright as before, then faded out and STOPPED.  Did this three more times. brighten, fade then stop. did this til it faded into the city glow on the horizon.  The object was far enough away to not be able to identify it or see any specific shape. It was a white light.;42.7409;-90.491
