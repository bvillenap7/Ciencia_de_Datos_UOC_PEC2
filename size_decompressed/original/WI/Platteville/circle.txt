circle of lights passed over head;1996-02-01 22:30:00;15 minutes;circle of lights passed over head I've been meaning to report this for a long time. It was in 96 i was in my back yard feeding my dog. We have a farm light in the back yard, but it shut off that night. I heard an electrical humming i thought was the light shorting out. So i looked up at it to see lights above the house, no more than 50 feet up moving about 10 - 15 mph. red lights lit up in a rotating circular pattern. Little airplane type lights. I could not see the shape of the craft or the edges. No light was reflecting off of it. It was a cloudy night, so the moon was blocked. the object slowly move from over my house from the west and moved eastward, overhead and eventually disappeared over a hill about 10 - 15 minutes later.
