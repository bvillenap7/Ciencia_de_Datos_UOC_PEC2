On Monday, June 28th, 2010, approximately 7pm (1900 hours) we where on our way home from Platteville, Wisconsin southbound on Hwy. 151.  I saw something reflecting in the sky that caught my attention and pointed it out to my husband.  It was traveling from East to West, was silver, and cigar or oval shape.  We kept discussing what we thought it could be, since we were intrigued by this thing in the sky.  There was no contrail from a jet/airplane and it seemed to be hovering at times, so we ruled out that option.  My husband then thought it could be the Space Station reflecting off the sun, so we called a friend who then went to the Space Station Tracking site.  He called us back and said the Space Station was not in our area at that particular time and the Space Station only travels from West to East.  During this time, my husband pulled over the truck so I could look through our binoculars, but I could never find the object when I used them.  My husband tried! as well, but our binoculars must not be that magnified.  We then continued on our way home, while following this object in the sky.  It seemed to move very slowly and would stop and hover.  We could still see the object slowly moving when we turned and pulled over on Cty. Rd. O towards home.  While traveling on Cty. Rd. O, we lost sight of this silver bright object due to the valley, bluffs and trees.  We never saw it again.;42.7409;-90.491
