Saw a tube like object traveling south to north at a not very fast speed...steady, but not as fast as a jet plane, nor was it that high...no wings or tail like a plane...looked white in the sun, not silver ...no vapor trail...just moving steadily...observed until it went out of my sight. I am a school bus driver for special needs child in wheelchair, and was outside of my bus lowering the lift and looked up at the beautiful blue sky when observed.  Asked the student's Mom to help me identify what I was seeing...she could not, but saw it also.;43.2718;-88.2111
