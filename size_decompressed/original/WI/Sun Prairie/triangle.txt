((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD))  We witnessed a soft glowing light off to the NE of our point of reference.;2004-10-31 00:00:00;10 min.;we witnessed a soft glowing light off to the northeast of our point of reference.  I stood there looking at it a moment,  thinking it to be a street light, but out of curiosity, I asked my boyfriend who had lived in that town his entire life, if he knew what it was. He said he didnâ€™t, so we both stood there watching it.  After we had both acknowledged  that it was there, the object floated upwards, then was zig-zagging left and right. The light began growing larger, and seemed to be moving along the street, that ran parallel to where we were standing.  Then it crossed east onto the street that ran right next to the park we were standing in. at this time my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to go back inside his house, and feeling uncomfortable and frightened by the light, which seemed very headlight like.  We ran towards his house, and the light unmistakably followed us. Now the light was three lights, one a headlight that shone outwards towards us, and the other two pointed towards the ground.  My boyfriend looked back up at it, now above us, and said it was a black triangle shape. It made no noise and emitted no trail, and it also blacked out the stars behind it. It was approximately 70 feet in width and only about 50 feet above the ground.  we ran in the house and were too afraid to venture outside to see if it had left. There was also a second sighting of the same lights/craft in the same location about a week and a half later, seen solely by my boyfriend.
