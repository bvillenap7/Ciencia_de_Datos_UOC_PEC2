I was walking at 330 am an a green oval object went over head and for seconds I and everything around me where a lite green color the same as the object.  It was going straight North.  It was fast, but you could almost see a green tail.  Maybe it was a falling star?  I have seen alot of stuff, but the fact everything turned lite green really freaked the hell out of me!   Has anyone have this happen to them?  Can something from space due this if it's coming through the atmosphere?  If so why did everything turn green?  Why did it look like it was flying, not falling?  It went straight overhead.;43.1896767988257;-89.2189038179159
