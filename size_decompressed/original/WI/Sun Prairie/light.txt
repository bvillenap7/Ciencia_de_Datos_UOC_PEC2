One large glowing flattened disk-shaped object travelled from East to West at an extremely high rate of speed in a non-linear path. Right before the shape disappeared, the object took an extreme left turn. Object was glowing white, like a star, but was larger and brighter than a star. No aircraft can make a turn like that. Object was seen at 7:45pm-7:47 at night from a lit parking lot in an unincorporated community with only one street light at the major intersection. Atmosphere was partialy cloudy. Temprature was low 20ยบF. There is an airport nearby from location. Airport is 7-10 miles to the Southwest of location.;43.1896767988257;-89.2189038179159
Dancing strobe light over Madison, WI.;2008-06-24 02:30:00;1 minute;Dancing strobe light over Madison, WI. What I first observed I thought was an plane.  It was a strobe light traveling at a familiar speed in a straight line a fairly good distance away.  Then as I was watching it, I suddenly thought there were 2, then maybe 3.  Then suddenly it would become one again.  Then the strobe would dissapear and for split second appear a good distance away from its path of direction before instantly appearing back again on path, as if it were dancing, or struggling to stay in this dimension.;43.1896767988257;-89.2189038179159

Driving east on highway 19, I noticed a low streaking light moving parallel/north of the highway.  It was on a low trajectory, moving toward the ground.   It moved faster than anything I've ever seen in the sky.  After a few seconds the light flared green and then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a meteor?  PD));43.1896767988257;-89.2189038179159
