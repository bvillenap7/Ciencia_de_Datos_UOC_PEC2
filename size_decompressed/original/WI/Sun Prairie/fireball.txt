Coming home from church Sunday night, close to our place, we saw 6 red-orange fireballs or something moving in a  southward direction in formation just above the lowest clouds.  No sound.   One or two disappeared, and another one had something come off of it and seemed to fly away from it.   Were they lanterns or something else?
