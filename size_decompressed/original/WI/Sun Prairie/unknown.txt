3 beams of light, silent, 7 other lights - South Central WI;2000-05-23 22:30:00;2 minutes;3 beams of light, silent, 7 other lights - South Central WI The object was silent, hovering approximately 200 feet from the road above a empty farm field. It was approximate 3-4 stories high (in relation to a building) and sat there silent. It emitted 3 dim beams of light downward while it also had a plus shape of lights in a row of 3 one way and 4 the other way. As I watched it, it gently moved away from me, and made no noise at all. It did not speed away, it barely moved. Very interesting. Not in a flight pattern as I had just come from the airport and flew in from Chicago as well.;43.1896767988257;-89.2189038179159
