As I was proceeding I noticed an orange light in the sky moving very slow like a helicopter coming out the south.  It was about at 230 degrees from my west bound position. It was not making any noise I could here.  It was moving slow then made a turn to the west and appeared to start climbing and accelerating.  From that moment in a matter of seconds it went out of sight.  Then another object came out the south following the same path as the first object and exited to the west in the same way the first object did. I may add I am a private pilot and notice aircraft all the time when I am outside.  This object that I witnessed was not an aircraft of any kind I have ever seen.  The fact that I could not hear the object was very strange.  Also the acceleration to the west was very unusual.  There were two teenagers on bikes that were passing by going east bound and turned around to see what I was watching.  They noticed the object was unusual and asked me what that was. I said to them, I donâ€™t know but it is not an airplane.   I could not see the objects shape or size due to bright orange light.  Also, I could not estimate the altitude or distance either.  But to give a comparison I thought it could be a helicopter at about 2000 feet, but there were no strobe lights and no red and green marker lights flashing, just an orange light. This was sighted at 21:30 cst in Sussex Wi.;43.145;-88.2283000000001
Objects Hovering;2019-07-23 06:26:00;5 minutes;Objects Hovering Facing south at intersection of CTY F and CTY K in Sussex, Wisconsin.  Looked up and noticed 2 objects to the south - one below and left of the other, at about 20 degrees from horizon.  At first thought they were helicopters hovering over an intersection on interstate 94 as this happens when there are accidents.  Proceeded to drive in that direction, glancing up occasionally to see if they were still there.  At on point, after about 4 minutes, saw them, glanced down at my speedometer, looked back up and they were gone. Objects were rock steady and did not move. No sound. Could not ascertain size as they were too far away.  Objects were about the size on an aspirin held at arms length. Checked with nearby airport.  They stated there were no helicopters in the vicinity.  Also checked with local TV stations to see if they use drones, they do not. Myself and owner of gas station witnessed this.;43.145;-88.2283000000001
