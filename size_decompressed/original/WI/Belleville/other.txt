The object seemed to stay in the same place.  I called a neighbor and he said that he couldn't see it because of trees in his yard but his brother in law had seen the same type of object earlier (unknown if earlier was earlier that night or another day).  My neighbor immediately asked if I had seen the different colored lights that I previously described.  After speaking with my neighbor, the object seemed to either move further in the distance or had dropped and then faded out of sight.  The object had 5 or 6 very long and sharp pointed arms.  The red and blue lights were around the center.;42.8646;-89.5354

The;2001-03-06 18:50:00;unknown;I have reported sightings on the two previous days and today again it looked different.  It almost looked like one giant sparkler.  The object moved only slightly and we were again looking west to northwest.  We did not watch it as much as we had the two previous nights, but tonight everytime we would watch it, it would get larger then smaller with it always being bright in color (red, blue, yellow).  There was a halo around it as well.  During the time we saw it, there was a plane that seemed to pass underneath it.  Nothing happened, just that we noticed a plane going by it.;42.8646;-89.5354

The object was again west to northwest and stood out with bright colors of blue, orange, red and white.  The object moved very little, had a circular white thing with orange and bluish flames on the right.;42.8646;-89.5354
