While recording it, it started to zig zag in different directions. As it was moving in fast speed it would also get long and skinny then back into a ball shape. There also seem to be different shades of color within the ball.  Seemed to be  a yellowish color in the middle with a red outside. While watching the video in slow motion on our T.V. it seemed to have a bottom shaped  in squares like outlined boxes.;42.8646;-89.5354
