White glowing object flying in sky.;2012-03-09 13:00:00;Two minutes;White glowing object flying in sky. I was driving down the road and I decided to look up in the sky.  The road I was on is a road that I drive on every single day.   As I looked up in the sky, I seen a white/glowing object.  It was far up in the sky and it seemed to be fairly big.  It was moving in all different directions and then disappeared.   I have never seen anything like this before and I called my family as soon as I seen it, I am positive it was not an airplane or anything of that matter.;42.8329;-87.9208
