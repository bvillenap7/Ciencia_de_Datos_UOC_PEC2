((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a twinkling star??  PD)) I was walking home and I noticed something sitting in one spot in the sky.  I stopped and kept looking at it to see if it would reveal itself as a plane or if it might be something else.  The thing just sat in the same spot.  I have seen similar things before but not quite as close and bright as this one was though it was still a significant distance away.  It would seem to move very slowly over the course of 30 minutes to an hour.  It was a light that seemed almost to change shape. It would look almost like a cross or a star at times, but it was clearly in the atmosphere. By a star I mean it would look almost how one would draw a star on a piece of paper like the religious symbol. Though it seemed to shift quickly and though the main source of light was tinny I thought I saw a blue light for a brief moment as well and there was an orange-ish color on the outer edge of the bright light.  I looked at it through a rifle scope and it definitely looked different sligh! tly magnified, but I still cannot put a finger on how I would accurately describe such a thing.  It might still be sitting there now.  I was playing the staring game with it for almost an hour and I lost and went inside.  I would hate to speculate, but the only three scenarios I can come up with of what something like this that just sits in the sky and slowly moves back and forth would be are either secret government technology, ET technology, or maybe even some type of inter-dimensional entity or spacecraft. I took a video of it. On camera it did not seem to look exactly the same while I was filming it but you could clearly see that it was sitting in one place while the planes were whizzing back and forth.;42.8329;-87.9208
South on I-94 Saturday , 08.27.16 at 8:45 pm irregular round shape initially and then unraveling before disappearing.;2016-08-27 18:45:00;5 minutes;South on I-94 Saturday , 08.27.16 at 8:45 pm irregular round shape initially and then unraveling before disappearing. We noticed the lights hovering in the sky and truly did not know what they were.  We were driving south on I-94 and we pulled off the side of the road to take pictures.  The string of these lights started merging together and then went up higher in the sky to disappear.   The pictures I took with my cell phone, shows them initially as bright red, and one light yellow irregular round in shape.  The final pictures before they disappeared looks as if they were unraveling.   First time in my life to have witnessed anything like this before.;42.8329;-87.9208
