Tube Shaped Craft Seen in Northern Wisconsin.;2013-06-16 15:15:00;3 minutes;Tube Shaped Craft Seen in Northern WIsconsin 6/18/13 Sighting of a Tube shaped aircraft in Porterfield, Wisconsin. 	On Father’s Day, 6/16/13, my dad and I were standing on his front porch.  It was after 3pm but the specific time I cannot say for sure.  We stepped out after the Brewers baseball game and were just talking on the porch about things.  It was defiantly afternoon. 	My dad first spotted it and the first thing we noticed was it didn’t have wings or a tale.  The “craft” looked like a fuselage of a smaller airplane, maybe a Concord.  There were no windows.  It was flying east to west.  We couldn’t say for sure if it was silent because there was a normal airplane flying high in the sky, and we could hear that engine.  I have witnessed small aircraft take off and land and there is usually a engine whine with it.  Even when they are in the air there is a distinct engine noise.  There was possibly a whisper noise from it but we cannot be 100% on that.  The craft was white in color and you could see a shadow on the bottom, indicating that it was tube shaped. 	The craft moved at a somewhat slow pace.  It is hard to estimate air speed, especially by an amateur, but I feel it was flying slower than a normal small engine plane. 	There was considerable cloudiness this day.  We were able to see the craft go into the clouds and see other more solid clouds behind it.  This, in my opinion, means that it was flying very low. 	From what we say the flight path stayed straight.  The craft didn’t turn or go higher or lower, from our point of view. 	Porterfield, WI is located in Marinette County and is about 50 miles north of Green Bay, WI.  My dad’s land is in a very unpopulated area and I am not aware of any military base close.;45.1924;-87.7985
