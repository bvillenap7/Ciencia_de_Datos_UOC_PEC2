Spacecraft Working Venus;2020-04-09 21:11:00;2 hours;Spacecraft Working Venus This video was created with pictures and video taken on a Cannon 77D and a Optecka 1000mm lens setup. Pictures and video taken at the location of the Rock Lake Pyramids, Lake Mills Wisconsin at 9:11pm on April 9th, 2020. At approximately 30 million miles, Venus has a very similar size and interior structure as the Earth. The Iron Nickel core that it has would be perfect for catching a Comet. By using Torsion Field Plasma Driven craft of 3 different origins, It appears Spacecraft are working together to pull Venus into somethings orbit. Pass over pass you can see the circular energy fields the craft drags along. They work behind Venus cover a vast amount of distance in a short period of time. To catch a Comet? Is there something big headed toward the Earth? Yes there is! Venus will make its closest approach on May 13th 2020 and will be with us until June 25th 2020.  “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.” &#8213 Nikola Tesla;43.0789000000001;-88.9206
