I noticed what looked like a string of geese flying very fast from Northwest to Southeast.  There were 3 lights in a row in the front, one slightly behind the northern most light, then at least ten lights following behind the center light.  I heard no sound and it was fast than birds or a commercial plane.  Within a minute, it was too far away to see.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
