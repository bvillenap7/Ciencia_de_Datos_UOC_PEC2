8 bright orange orbs flying horizontally southbound across east sky in seen from La Crosse, Wisconsin 1/1 12;2012-01-01 00:10:00;10 min;8 bright orange orbs flying horizontally southbound across east sky in seen from La Crosse, Wisconsin 1/1 12 Sightings witnessed by husband and wife in La Crosse WI. approximately 12:10 am 1/1/12. It was cloudy and raining so you couldn't see any stars, planes, satellites, etc.  We were watching fireworks display slightly northeast when we saw a bright orange round object (#1) flying mostly horizontally in the east-southeast sky flying to the right of the fireworks southbound. The speed was fast but not constant, it seemed to slow up or slightly at times. We watched it fly south until it was out of sight (took about 60-90 seconds)  Within 2 minutes a second one (#2)flew through same part of sky but that one dropped down out of sight in a minute or so.  A few minutes later four more at once (#3 #4 #5 and #6) flew the same pattern, direction and speed but #5 dropped out of sight while the rest flew and diminished to the south. A few minutes later #7 flew the same direction etc and diminished in the south sky, a few minutes later #8 did the same. Color of objects was mostly orange but looked yellow or even reddish at times. The total sighting lasted approximately 10 minutes. Both witnesses agree to have never seen a UFO before this sighting.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
Several bright, circular, firework like objects hung on the horizon.;2020-07-27 22:45:00;~5 minutes;Several bright, circular, firework like objects hung on the horizon. Looked like fireworks at first but then they hung in the air.  I thought maybe it was a fire over the horizon because they seemed to be lighting up the ground.  Most of them seemed to slowly sink down over the horizon and I could see smoke (with binoculars).  Then another one seemed to appear out of nowhere.  It hung in the air for a while (very bright) then seemed to speed away very quickly.  They were a long ways off, seemed to be in the vicinity of Sparta WI.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
