5 lights in V formation, racing across night sky before abruptly disappearing;2005-10-15 01:30:00;5 sec;5 lights in V formation, racing across night sky before abruptly disappearing When sitting outside of a dance club getting some fresh air, my friends and I were looking up at the sky and happened to catch what we thought was a falling star.   Within a split-second, we realized that we in face were seeing 5 lights, formed in a perfect V, moving rapidly along the night sky.   Within 5 seconds, and as we watched, the lights just disappeared.   We each looked at each other and said You saw that, right?   Could have been aircrafts of some sort, but weird how the lights just disappeared.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074

They traveled at a steady speed and were completely silent. One followed the other at a perfect distance never straying. We watched them until they disappeared over the bluffs.
