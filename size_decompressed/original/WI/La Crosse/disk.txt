Lights revolving around it.  Motionless. This happened over the south side ShopKo parking lot.  It was very light and bright sunny afternoon.  My Mother, myself (age 14), my 3 girlfriends were getting out of our car.  I looked up and noticed a large disk shaped object.  It was silver/grey or metalic looking.  It had windows around the disk.  There were red, blue, green, etc color lights revolving back and forth around it.  It just hoovered over the parking lot.  Stationary never moving.  It had a low hum.  Definetly not an airplane or hellacopter sound or ability to stay still.  There was no breeze or wind comming off of the ship.  I yelled at it to take me.  It didn't.  My Mother told me to shut up!  I did.  Everyone was looking up at it.  Then it just took off faster than light and disapeared. This was reported to the police and on the news.  No explaination for it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074

((HOAX??))  I saw a saucer shaped object moving at high speeds that had lights blinking along the edges of it.;2008-08-08 00:30:00;120 seconds;I saw a saucer shaped object moving at high speeds that had lights blinking along the edges of it. Me and my friend were spending a night in a tent by his woods and we decided to stargaze.  We had been star gazing for a good 20 minutes vefore this happened, and we had seen a extrodinary 12 shooting stars in that time period.  I saw a UFO (kind of like the ones you see in the movies) moving at quite a fast speed coming from the northwest and exiting behind the trees in the southeast.  It had sort of a rythimic circular motion of lights around the outside of the saucer.  (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow)  The noise it made was quite odd, sort of like water rushing through a tube.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
