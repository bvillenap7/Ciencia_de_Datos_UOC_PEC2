I looked up and saw the triangular shape above us with round yellowish lights in a v shape.  I found it amazing that we were all looking and seeing it.  Then, there was a strange uncomfortable feeling for a second and no one said anything and then moved to different parts of the roof as if we hadn't seen it, I looked up to see it moving north west.  then it was gone.  I was confused and asked the others why they were acting strangely...they asked what I thought I had seen.  I didn't answer, but asked what they saw, three people said they saw ducks---one heard them and said they were brown, another said they were white and another greyish.  I asked, weren't they moving awfully slow for ducks???  They didn't know what to say.  The fourth person said he saw ducks, but then he saw something else for a moment, a triangular shaped craft.  I clearly saw a craft the whole time and never saw any ducks.  Actually, I asked my companions what they saw as the ship was above us.  And that was when I asked them aren't they moving very slow for ducks.  Then, after the strange moment where everyone froze and then moved away (two started to pull in the kite) that is when I asked for details of the ducks.  And I actually had an argument with one of my friends who was angry that I had seen something different than him and he was convinced of what he saw.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
Triangle air craft.;2013-11-13 19:30:00;10 seconds;triangle air craft We were driving north west on CTY HWY 14/61 towards La Crosse and saw a solid looking, dark gray, silent triangle pass over us.  The triangle appeared slim and solid, it also appeared to have a dim bluish light at each point of the flying triangle.  It was flying just a few feet above the tree tops near the highway.  I also seemed to be silent as is passed above us.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
Triangle with lights gliding over neighborhood.;2015-11-01 03:30:00;2 minutes;Triangle with lights gliding over neighborhood. It was looking out the back porch windows at about 3:30am (couldn’t sleep) and looked up to check out the stars.  The sky was incredibly clear. Looking south, in the direction of Orion was a triangle gliding across the sky, over the house and heading northwest. It was a nearly black triangle with lights all around it.  9 in all:  one in each corner and 2 in between.  None of them blinked and they were a soft off-white color.  It slowly glided over the neighborhood.   After it passed over the house and out of sight, I waited for any airplane noise but I never heard any.  I watched the windowpanes for a while to see if the passing cars made the same light pattern on the glass and they never did.   I was never afraid AND I just went back to bed and fell asleep (which I hadn't been able to do up until that point) and didn’t remember it the next morning until after I walked the dog and started reading my weirder websites and one of them mentioned a UFO sighting and I was like all of a sudden, OMG!  I saw a UFO last night!  How could I have forgotten that?;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
