Driving south on Hwy35,Isaw what appeared to be an air craft crossing the Mississippi river with two white lights which did not strobe.;2000-02-06 22:30:00;5 minutes;Driving south on Hwy35,Isaw what appeared to be an air craft crossing the Mississippi river with two white lights which did not strobe.Mississippi river mile marker 691.It crossed the main channel and dropped in altitude slowed below the stall speed of an air plane.as it moved east towards Hwy,35 It stopped over goose island park,the southern end .I pulled over at park entrance which I believe closes at 10:00pm Then the two white lights went out,for about 15 seconds,then on moved slowly stopped lights out and after the third time stopped and started to descend below the tree line,and its light's went out.I drove south. The two white light's kept at an equal distance even when turned on again,I opened my window and could hear no helicopter sound and the lighte were spaced too far apart for any helicopter fuselage.There were four cars ahead of me going south they all slowed down but no one pulled over .I wish I would have drove down to the southern end of the park wear there is a boat landing.It would have been worth the fine!I believe it did land.If you are looking for landing site trace evidence this would in my opinion be a likly spot,Before we get anymore snow!;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
orange light at night;2012-05-17 22:30:00;5 sec;orange light at night Playing cards with friends in my house.  One of my friends noticed a wierd light outside.  It was very windy with the wind blowing from the south.  I looked out the window and stepped out on a small deck outside my house.  I observed an orange object what appeared to be possibly flowing in the wind.  It made no noise but my friends thought it might be a chinese lantern.  I dont believe it was a lantern the winds would have blown out the candle.  The trees blocked my view within a few seconds so I had a limited amount of time to study the object.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
