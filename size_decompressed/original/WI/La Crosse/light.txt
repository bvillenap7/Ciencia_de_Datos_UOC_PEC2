I grabbed one of my friends to see it.  He agreed it was strange and that it was there.  A few years later he denied that he ever saw anything.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
Object appeared in telescope field of view, and executed 90 degree turn before moving out of field of view.;2000-07-22 22:45:00;6-8 seconds;Object appeared in telescope field of view, and executed 90 degree turn before moving out of field of view. Object observed through telescope.  Object estimated to be mag. 8.0 to 8.5, blue-white in appearance, observed for 6-8 seconds.  Object observed to execute 90 degree turn in field of view of telescope, then exit field of view.  Although object appeared to be similar to what a satellite looks like when it shoots across my field of view, satellites do not execute turns.  Object did not slow down while turning.  Entire turn took 2-3 seconds, and object observed to fly in straight lines 1-2 seconds before and after executing turn.  No running lights observed.  Thus, plus speed of turn and turn radius rule out aircraft of known kind.  Turn appeared smooth.  Object observed while looking for Comet Linear, approximately 8 degrees from lower pointer star in big dipper region.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
Extremely bright white light that I captured on camera over the city of La Crosse WI;2009-09-05 19:20:00;second;Extremely bright white light that I captured on camera over the city of La Crosse WI We were visiting in La Crosse WI over Labor Day weekend.  We had just gotten off the River Boat Dinner Cruise headed back to our Hotel room at the Radisson.  As we were walking in Riverside Park along the Mississippi River I was taking pictures. The sun was just setting for the evening.  I had snapped a few pictures of the sunset and some of my family.  I came upon this beautiful bronze sculpture of a playful young boy & girl.  I took a picture with my Canon Power Shot digital camera.  I was not using the view finder, instead I was using the digital screen.  My boyfriends sister was standing right next to me at the time.  An extremely bright light just above the trees in the eastern night sky appeared on the screen along with the bronze sculpture.  We immediately took our eyes off the camera screen to see what was in the sky, but nothing was there.  My boyfriend thought that it was the flash from the camera.  Within seconds I took another picture, using the same camera and setting. Absolutely no light or flash in the sky.  It’s appeared at first to be a six pointed star shape, but after some thought I believe it could have been a horizontal oval shape.  The shutter could have stayed open for a second or two and I maybe caught on camera it changing from horizontal to vertical and then disappearing before our eyes.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
4 or 5 pulsating balls of orange light, not paper lanterns, some kind of formation, hovering.;2013-05-05 00:30:00;5 minutes;4 or 5 pulsating balls of orange light, not paper lanterns, some kind of formation, hovering. My boyfriend and I were driving home after seeing a friend and we saw orange pulsating lights in the sky.  They almost looked like paper  lanterns but it was too windy for them to possibly be lanterns. They kept pulsating or going out and reappearing.   We were driving along the Mississippi in La Crosse at about 12:30am.  They were also very big, too big to be paper lanterns and fly in formation.   It wasn't in any particular formation but it was abnormal.  My boyfriend doesn't believe in UFOs but he thought it was quite strange… ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting occurred on Monday, May 06th, 2013, and have amended the date.  PD));43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
