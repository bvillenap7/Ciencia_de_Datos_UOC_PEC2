As I looked at it I saw something flying away from it. It looked like a banana whith a piont sticking out on the opposit side from the curve like this (- . It was flying really really fast away from the burning thing whith the curve forword, it would fly about this far (from where I was it looked like it) ---------------------------------- then stop and then backwards about this far.       -------------- . Then it stoped and and flew strait down beyond the horizon.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
Orange pulsating ball of light;2013-07-04 21:45:00;10 minutes;Orange pulsating ball of light Before the festivities and fireworks took place on the Mississippi on July 4th. I witnessed a couple of orange balls of light that were pulsating.   I know there were probably upwards of 10-20 thousand people at the park so I couldn’t have been the only one to see them.   It started at the southern part of the city and moved, what looked like, along the rivers path north.  The orange light would pulse on and off.  It seemed to be sporadic and not at the same timed interval.  There was no sound, it was hard to judge the distance up in the air.  Though it could have been an airplane.   I previously served in the Army and know of UAV’s and their ability to fly with a lack of noise at a certain height.  It looked to be moving too slowly and the light would have flashed at a specific interval.   Once it had made its way “up the river” and was near the Wisconsin Minnesota border, I noticed another one.   At this point it looked as if they were hovering, I am not sure if it was due to the distance away that they didn’t look like they were moving.   But they didn’t seem to be getting any further away. The sighting posted on 5/6/13 of orange lights, that are almost lanterns sounds just like what I saw as well.;43.8133843373491;-91.2235129518074
