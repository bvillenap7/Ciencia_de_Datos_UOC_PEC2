Well I was in my room and saw how pretty the sun set was, so I grabbed my camera and went outside to take a picture.  A month later i developed them, and saw this disk shaped thing on it, and sent it to one of my friends who is into the UFO stuff and told me to send it to some places who know what the're doing.
