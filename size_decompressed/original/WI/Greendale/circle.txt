UFO Files Observation;2004-10-23 14:05:00;5 sec.;UFO Files Observation Please note that this was not a first hand sighting, but an observation I just made watching The UFO Files documentatry on the History Channel.  Towards the beginning of the show, the Mexico City sitings are highlighted.  One of the video camera shots is of multiple (approx. 15) UFOs clustered in the sky.  What I noticed was that the UFOs, if you connect them like dots, make the shape of a radar antenna.  They did not mention this on the show and I am not aware of anybody making this observation before.  Have you seen this or noticed this before?  If you have the video or a still shot of the siting (I searched the internet and couldn't find it) I stongly encourage you to check it out.  Please let me know if you know what I'm writing about.  Once you notice the radar antenna pattern/shape, it's very obvious and leaves little if any to imagination.  If I thought it was just a coincidence or a stretch, I wouldn't bother writing you about it.  Feel free to phone me if you need more detail.  Thanks, ((name deleted));42.9351999999999;-87.9961999999998
