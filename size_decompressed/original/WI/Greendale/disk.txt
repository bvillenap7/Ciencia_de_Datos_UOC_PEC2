Half acre sized black disc seen over Greendale, Wisconsin.;2001-08-28 21:45:00;apx. 4 minutes;Half acre sized black disc seen over Greendale, Wisconsin. The object was totally black. It was disc shaped. There was a golden yellow light in the very center. It was flying very low, about 100 feet above the tree tops. It was in sight for about four minutes, due to trees blocking the view. I had assumed that discs were silver, and the triangular ones were black. It was rather large. I would guess it would take up about 1/2 an acre if it landed. It DID make a sound. It sounded like a pulsing jet engine. It wasn't particularly loud, however. There was a lot of air traffic last night. Particularly high flying, fast jets. Also several satellites passed overhead between nine pm and 11 pm.;42.9351999999999;-87.9961999999998
