And boy was it moving fast .all i saw then  was a dim blue type outline as it went on a angle from low west to straight up and east toward lake michigan.it was then gone so i went to get gas at a station up the road and i just couldnt keep this to myself so i mentioned it to the clerk and he really did not understand me because i dont think he could speak english to well. He just looked at me took my money and said ,thank you. so i came home and sat here a few and i went crazy thinking who do i tell and who dont i tell. dont want to be in a rubber room .so i went to my web tv and used the search mode to find this site.i also want to say that i did drive past are airport just to see if i could see anything strange .we do have a base here but they dont have the stealth bomber as far as i know and that is what this object kind of looked like but made no noise and no lights besides the dim blue outline.;42.9351999999999;-87.9961999999998
