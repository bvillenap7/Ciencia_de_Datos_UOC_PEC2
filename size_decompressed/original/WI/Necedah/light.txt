Green Lightts spotted dropping into river and leaving,  returns every year;1995-07-12 15:00:00;10 minutes;Green Lightts spotted dropping into river and leaving,  returns every year In 1995 i was coming home from grocery shopping with my parents and saw a green light in the sky.  It had 3 smaller green lights coming out of it.  It was like the big green light the first one flew in then a smaller one came out of it, and a smaller one came out of that one, and then a smaller one came out of that one.  They looked like they were dropping into a river not far from where we were.  This went on for about 10 minutes and then the green light flew away.  Every year since that time it happens almost like clock work.  Same place.  We do have an airforce base maybe 40 miles away  but it is used for training purposes only.  Because i had the thought that there is some logical explanation for this event.  So far i havent come up with one and it happens every year.
