One orb disappeared and the other orb shot a light beam straight up and the second orb appeared a ways away above the other one. They blinked on and off for 20 plus minutes. I did video tape the lights for a bit, but I did not tape them when I first saw them intertwined and split. Was not sure of what I was seeing.
