Orange object seen moving across night sky.  Did not have a trail, nor did it fragment, explode, or change size;2010-05-28 22:12:00;30-45 seconds;Orange object seen moving across night sky.  Did not have a trail, nor did it fragment, explode, or change size On Friday 28MAY2010, a friend and I were visiting a third friend at his house in Green Bay.  The residence is located just southeast of St. Vincent Hospital  (The hospital is visible from the backyard).  This residence is on the east side of Green Bay, approximately 3 miles north of WI-172, and 3-4 miles east of the Fox River (Distances are rough estimates!)    At approximately 10:10 PM, the three of us were sitting on the back deck of the house.  I was sitting on a bench at the edge of the deck and right next to the house, facing north-northwest.  Friend #1 was sitting directly to my left, facing due North.   Friend #2 was sitting on a picnic table in the middle of the deck facing us.  As we were talking, Friend #1 happened to look up in roughly northeastern direction and see something in the sky. He remarked Is that an airplane?  That's not an airplane!.   At this point, I cannot remember if he indicated the direction the object was traveling.  I could not see the object from where I was sitting because the house blocked my view.  I instinctively turned to my left and looked upward over my shoulder, where I was able to view a patch of sky not obscured by the house or the stand of trees at the edge of the property.  I managed to see the object as it moved. I saw what appeared to be an orange fire-colored object, very roughly circular, but nebulous in appearance, moving across the sky at a rapid clip. It was about as large as the thumbnail on a man's pinky finger, if held at arms length.  There was no trail or halo around this object, nor did it change size as it moved. Once the object was obscured by trees, I dashed for the west end of the yard, where the line of trees ended (about 15-20 feet past the end of the deck).  The object again entered my field of view.  Its characteristics had not changed in the few seconds where I moved my position.  The object continued on a straight-line course from east-northeast to west-southwest.  It did not change speed.  It did not appear to change altitude.  The object did not change color or size either.  Everything remained constant until it appeared to fade just before it left our available field of vision.  One characteristic of the object that struck me is that the center appeared darkened somewhat compared to the outer edges.  When the object disappeared, it did not flash, blink or explode, it just faded in about a half-second. The sky was clear that night. Despite there being a large volume of commerical air traffic in Green Bay, there was no air traffic sighted other than the emergency medevac helicopter that periodically flew in to land at the nearby hospital. I do not think the flight path of incoming planes intersects with the helicopter's usual flight pattern. This helicopter was not in the area during the sighting. As my friends and I discussed this object, we were of the initial opinion that it was some type of celestial body which entered and then exited the atmosphere.  However the absence of a trail, and the constant shape/size of the object are disconcerting when considering this theory.  Growing up in the country, I have seen my share of Shooting stars, meteorites, orbiting satellites, and what have you.  Most meteors I've seen actually moved FASTER that the object in question.  The absence of trail is not all that unusual, but a meteor travelling at what appeared to be quite an oblique angle, visible for 30+ seconds, would seem to be large enough to expect to see a trail behind it. The entire event lasted about one minute, or one minute 30 seconds, from the time my friend spotted the object to the time it disappeared. Due to my uncertainty about what I saw, I am submitting this report with hopes that:  1) it can be compared to any similar reports submitted from 5/28/2010 or otherwise from Brown County/Green Bay  2) The experts at NUFORC can indicate the likelihood that this was indeed a meteorite or similar (re-entering satellite?) and NOT a UFO  Thank you for your accepting this report;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
36 orange lights seen over Green Bay by seven in parking lot.  Objects heading south to north in the western sky.;2012-08-21 20:45:00;22 minutes;36 orange lights seen over Green Bay by seven in parking lot.  Objects heading south to north in the western sky. After exiting vehicle at East side Menardâ€™s Home Improvement Store, I witnessed three objects moving from the southwest toward the north, in the western sky.  One object was in the lead, followed by two in tight, stacked formation.  The objects where orange maybe orange-red.  They were not moving exceptionally fast, but faster than a balloon.  Then more began to appear, moving in a similar direction some faster than others, thus negating the possibility of a wind-blown object.  Within 20 seconds I witnessed a fourth and fifth object enter the sky and stopped in the middle of the drive lane to watch.  At this moment, an employee stopped to watch with me.  By the time I entered the store, we had counted 11.  I was in the store for only about 5 minutes.  When I went outside, the same employee reported to me that he had counted 29.  By that time, people started to gather and discuss what the objects could be.  One bystander pointed out a plane that looked noth! ing like the objects we were witnessing.  The space station was also located in the night sky.  By the time the event was over, we had counted at least 36 objects (there may have been more before I identified the first object.)  I believe there were 7 of us in total that saw the event.  I called a local television station who admitted to having received multiple calls reporting the incident.  I was unable to take photos as my smartphone battery had died 3 hours earlier.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
Fast moving, silent illuminated craft spotted of Green Bay Wisconsin.;2015-11-16 01:20:00;4 minutes;Fast moving, silent illuminated craft spotted of Green Bay Wisconsin. 4 MINUTES AGO ( 1:20 am central ) I was standing outside in front of my home letting my dog do his business on the east side Green Bay, WI.  I saw what appeared at a distance to be a Helicopter approaching from the west but as it neared I thought it was odd I heard no rotor noise, and it was moving fast I judged the height it was traveling at no more than 5000 feet but the speed was 3-4 times the speed of a helicopter maybe 400 - 500 miles per hour....as it approached from the west I saw what I thought were red & white lights but as it got closer then  passed over head the lights became subdued & virtually dark with a very subdued reddish color tone on the underside of the vehicle...it could see it cruise across the night sky heading east until it went out of sight...... this was NO man made aircraft...no jet noise, no air plane motor noise, no helicopter rotor noise, no white and red marker strobes on the wings & belly of the aircraft...... totally Silent,  low ceiling & moving between 400-500 miles per hour.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
