While looking up at the stars, I saw a light moving at right angles in a zig-zag pattern from the eastern horizon going west. I told my husband and two friends there with me to look at it. We all agreed that it was not an aircraft of any type we knew ( my husband was a licensed pilot) and I was a student pilot at the time. It was high in the sky, estim. at least 10k feet or higher. It traveled in a straight path above the horizon, and as it reached the western sky, suddenly a very bright strobe light flashed 3 times in rapid succession, and 4 other lights emerged rapidly from the source of the light, flew rapidly away, and all disappeared.

Three red lights;1997-10-01 19:00:00;15-20 minutes;Three red lights I was in 8th grade and I grew up about 500 feet from Lambeau Field and my dad, brother best friend and I went outside to listen for the starting lineups when my brother noticed in the northeast sky 3 red lights the were horizontal in a line and then they slowly began to move and spread apart going from this . . . to making a vertical line up and down so like an I and then they were gone.  My friend and told people what we saw at school but no one else saw anything.  For Packer games the down pretty much shuts down and you hunker in a party. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

A loose formation of 3 orange non-blinking lights observed slowly crossing evening sky.;1997-11-02 18:50:00;appx. 10 mins.;Summary : A loose formation of 3 orange non-blinking lights observed slowly crossing evening sky. A formation of 3 orange non-blinking lights was observed  11/02/97  18:50  Green Bay, WI  When first spotted by my mother[49], they were in a roughly triangular formation, moving slowly east.  She called for me to come outside and look at somthing.  I went out and watched them for about 5 minutes until the upper two were slowly enveloped in the cloud cover.  I went inside and got my SLR camera & 400mm lens.  I went back out and looked at the remaining light, but the strong lens showed revealed no shape behind the light.  The other two lights now began to emerge from the clouds and the formation of the three was now close to linear and vertical.  I would estimate their distance to be about 2-3 miles.  I couldn't tell if they were making any sound because a helicopter was hovering 1.3 miles to the west, over the football stadium.  The orange lights had no accompanying aircraft-style strobes or red/blue positioning lights.  They did not move constantly, as a sattelite would and! the cloud cover was dense enough to obscure anything that high or faint.  I am 34 and I am quite familiar with the way civil and military aircraft move.  These lights moved similarly to helicopters, but had no regulation lights and didn't generate the sounds that a group of 3 military helicopters would make.  I asked a neighbor to look at them.  He did, but looked for 3 seconds, said Oh, airplanes, and went back inside. I was looking for film inside for 2 minutes and when I went back outside, the 3 lights had vanished.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
Satilite looking dot that would streak every minute or so.;2000-06-22 22:35:00;10 minutes;Satilite looking dot that would streak every minute or so. 06-23-2000 Last night I was out having a smoke watching the SE sky and noticed a light in the corner of my eye. At first I thought it was just a satillite but it blinked in and out - almost a three or four second pulse. When it was not pulsed or lit up, it was really hard to see. then my wife noticed a second one. Normally I would just shrug this sighting off as explainable until they would flash or streak What I'm saying is, they kept on their path heading NW (went through Big Dipper - eventually) and as they traveled they would throw off this very bright Streak about 10 times longer than they were. It was if they were turning on massive bright headlights. Pretty neat. ((NUFORC Note:  This incident occurred approximately 5 minutes after an airline pilot on the east coast reported having an anomalous, apparently non-aerodynamic, object streak past his aircraft, within approximately 50 vertical feet of his right wing.

Two orangish balls of light;2004-10-31 22:00:00;5-10 seconds;Two orangish balls of light It was Hallowen night and my friends and I were walking to a bar called Keeters on Washington St in downtown Green Bay that runs north/south when we noticed two orangish red balls going from north to south not very high in the sky with no noise at all and then were somewhat side by side but not connected and then the flew right over us no noise once again and then they started to almost criss crose back and forth and we thought they were going to colide and then they were gone. No way were they planes no noise at all and at the height they were at youd be able to tell. I lived near Lambeau Field and when they do fly overs its nothing like what I saw. They make lots of noise and you can see the afterburners and the red and green lights on the wings.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
2 orange quick moving lights;2004-10-31 22:00:00;10 seconds;2 orange quick moving lights We were walking to a bar north on Washington st and we turned south to wait for our friend that was walking slow and then we saw these two orange circular lights that were flying south to north going side to side quickly yet very smooth with no noise.   Theres no way they were planes on how they would move side to side and they were low and no noise.  I've lived near an airport my entire life and know planes.   At one point we thought they were going to collide.   They almost mived as if they were magnets repulsing each other;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
Silent light UFO spotted and rose into the clouds.;2013-10-14 19:30:00;3 minutes;Silent light UFO spotted and rose into the clouds. My boyfriend and I were taking our dogs to Howard Dog Park in Green Bay, WI, right off Military Road, near the interstate.  It was about an hour after sunset.  I saw a slightly slow moving light fly in a strange pattern, almost like it was weaving in between stars above.  It got closer and then passed us, pretty high up there, and continued north east, over the lake, and it seemed to get slower and higher up and disappear into the clouds.  Just one light, no flashes, no noise.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205

Hi Altitude above normal ISS path traveling 2 times ISS speed makes two course corrections!;2014-07-25 22:38:00;4 minutes;Hi Altitude above normal ISS path traveling 2 times ISS speed makes two course corrections! Object appeared to be at a higher altitude that what we would expect for the International Space Station.  I check and the ISS is over Afganastan at this time.   Object appeared as a satellite in orbital path heading north by northwest slightly.   I took it as a possible satellite until 2 minutes into my observation, the object made a course correction about 15 degrees to the right as if to miss something.   About 15 seconds later the object corrected again, this time about 25 degrees to the left.   Object was NOT a Satellite.  Very High and traveling at a speed about twice the speed of what the ISS is normally observed at.   That is All.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
Lights hovering in the sky for extended period of time in NE Wisconsin.;2014-07-25 23:00:00;1 hour;Lights hovering in the sky for extended period of time in NE Wisconsin. I saw this object late Friday night in the sky.  I watched it for about an hour.  I have not seen it since.   It was facing west over North East Wisconsin.  I took these pictures on a Sony A-100 with a 4.5-5.6/75-300 lens with a long exposure.  It appeared to be slanting toward the left and hovered over the same area.  There were no noises and it was higher than a plane with blinking lights.  There are no radio towers or tall buildings in this direction.  It's a rural area. http://imgur.com/a/wwGtg  Close ups:  http://imgur.com/YOTGqIy  http://imgur.com/jflLwkY http://imgur.com/huVwyq9  http://imgur.com/Ad1YZft  http://imgur.com/XbWkBXr;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
12 or so orange orbs appearing and fading away, all going the same speed, in the same direction.;2015-07-24 21:30:00;30 seconds per orb;12 or so orange orbs appearing and fading away, all going the same speed, in the same direction. Me and my friend were out for a walk, and on our way back to the house, we saw 2 orange glowing orbs floating, perfectly in sync with one another.   Roughly 30 seconds after we first spotted them the orb on the bottom started to fade out and eventually disappeared.  Another 30 seconds after the bottom orb faded away the top one started to fade out.   When me and my friend turned onto the road we live on we saw another orange orb floating in the exact same direction at the same speed.  This one also lasted roughly 30 seconds before fading away.   For the next 5 minutes or so, more of these orbs were appearing and fading away all the exact same way as the first 2.  The orbs also seemed to be moving farther away the closer we came to them.  These orbs had no flashing lights or trails from behind them.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205

Bright light high in sky, not moving for awhile but moving down slowly and intermittently, different movement from planes we see here.;2020-04-13 22:30:00;20 minutes;Bright light high in sky, not moving for awhile but moving down slowly and intermittently, different movement from planes we see here. We saw a bright light moving off west of us high in the sky.  It would move slowly and intermittently, mostly  down and down.  We normally see planes come to and from the nearby airport, but this light would stay in place except for the occasional movement.  We could make out the occasional light red lights, but not as dark as an air plane light.  Again, we normally would see a plane land or move upwards, but this light disappeared instantly.  Also, it was higher than the planes coming through when we first saw it which is what we thought it was strange and watched it slowly move for awhile.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
