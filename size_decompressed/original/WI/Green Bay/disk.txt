UFO VIDEO TAPED BY T.V. CAMERMAN;1992-05-10 10:00:00;3 SECONDS;UFO VIDEO TAPED BY T.V. CAMERMAN I WORK AS A PROFESSIONAL TELEVISION NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER....AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING I HAD BEEN ON THE JOB FOR 7 YEARS. ONE OF MY ASSIGNMENTS ON THE DATE LISTED ABOVE, WAS TO GO OUT AND GET WHAT WE CALL WEATHER SHOTS...THIS IS STATIC SHOT {VIDEO} OF SOMETHING WEATHER RELATED, TO BE USED DURING THE WEATHER SEGMENT OF OUR NEWSCAST. I DECIDED TO GO AND DRIVE TO THE RURAL AREA JUST SOUTHEAST OF GREEN BAY...I CAME ACROSS A SMALL FARM WITH AN OLD-FASHION WINDMILL. I ASKED THE OWNER IF I COULD TAKE A FEW SHOTS AND HE GAVE ME PERMISSION. IT WAS A SUNNY MORNING...SOME HIGH, THIN CLOUDS...I POSITIONED MY CAMERA { ON A TRI-POD } AT AN UPWARD ANGLE, FRAMING THE WINDMILL BLADES TURNING WITH THE SUN IN THE BACKGROUND. I HIT THE RECORD BUTTON ON MY CAMERA...AND I WALKED OVER TO TALK WITH A COUPLE LITTLE CHILDREN WHO WERE PLAYING ON A SWINGSET BEHIND ME. AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES I RETURNED TO MY CAMERA...STOPPED RECORDING AND PACKED UP MY EQUIPMENT. I DROVE BACK TO THE TELEVISION STATION TO EDIT THE VIDEO I HAD SHOT AT THE FARM. AS I LOOK AT THE VIDEO. I SAW A SPOT OF LIGHT MOVE ACROSS THE SCREEN VERY QUICKLY...IF YOU BLINKED, YOU WOULD MISS IT. I THOUGHT I HAD A BAD SPOT ON THE TAPE...AND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE SHOT...BUT AS I SLOWED THE TAPE DOWN...FRAME BY FRAME...I NOTICED THAT THE SPOT OF LIGHT WAS NOT A FLAW IN THE TAPE...BUT AN OBJECT...IT MOVED FROM SCREEN RIGHT TO LEFT...TRAVELED IN A STRAIGHT LINE...FLEW BEHIND THE WINDMILL AND INTO SOME CLOUDS. IT WAS BRIGHT WHITE...AND MOVING VERY VERY FAST. I ASKED MY BOSS TO COME AND HAVE A LOOK...HE HAD SERVED IN THE U.S. NAVY ON AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND KNEW A THINK OR TWO ABOUT JET AIRCRAFT. HE WAS AMAZED. I DECIDED TO CALL OUR LOCAL AIRPORT...THEY TOLD ME THE CLOUDS AT THE TIME I TOOK THE VIDEO WERE AT 20,000 FT. I ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD PICKED ANYTHING UP ON RADAR...THEY TOLD ME NO, BUT GAVE ME THE PHONE NUMBER OF K.I. SAWYER AIR FORCE BASE IN UPPER MICHIGAN...I CALLED...THEY DID NOT HAVE MUCH TO SAY TO ME...BUT THEY ASKED ME TO CONTACT A GROUP IN WASHINGTON STATE...I CANNOT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THAT GROUP...I CALLED AND GAVE A REPORT. I WAS PUT IN CONTACT WITH MUFON...WHO PUT ME IN CONTACT WITH A GENTELMAN FROM MILWAUKEE. THAT EVENING I SPOKE WITH THE GUY FROM MILWAUKEE...HE TOLD ME HE WAS GOING TO MAKE A TRIP UP TO GREEN BAY TO SEE THE VIDEO. THE GUY...HIS NAME WAS JEFF...HAD A LOOK AND WAS VERY INTERESTED. I TOOK HIM OUT TO THE FARM TO SHOW HIM THE WINDMILL ETC. JEFF HAD ANOTHER MAN WITH HIM, I DO NOT RECALL HIS NAME. THEY HAD ME SET UP MY EQUIPMENT JUST THE WAY I HAD DURING THE SIGHTING...THEY TOOK MEASUREMENTS...CLIMBED THE WINDMILL...MEASURED THE BLADES....SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME GATHERING DATA. THEY TOOK THIS DATA AND A COPY OF THE VIDEO AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD GET BACK TO ME. LATER THEY HAD ME SEND THE ORIG. VIDEO TAPE TO BE LOOKED AT BY THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE TAPE...THEY FOUND NO DEFECT THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE OBJECT TO APPEAR ON THE TAPE.  IN A WEEK OR SO..MAYBE LONGER...I RECEIVED A REPORT ON THEIR FINDINGS. THE OBJECT WAS NO KNOWN AIRCRAFT...IT WAS TRAVELING AT EST. 14,000 MPH...IT WAS OVER 300 FT LONG...AND OVER 100 FT TALL...A COMPUTER GENERATED CLOSE-UP OF THE OBJECT SHOWED IT TO BE A DISC SHAPED OBJECT AS SEEN FROM THE SIDE. THE PHOTO ALSO SHOWED THE OBJECT WAS WARMER ON THE NOSE AND TAIL THEN IN THE MIDDLE. WE AT THE TELEVISION STATION HAD TAKEN THE VIDEO A ZOOMED IN ON THE OBJECT AS IT TRAVELED...YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT THE DISC PASSES BEHIND THE WINDMILL...COMES OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND DISAPPEARS INTO A CLOUD.  THERE YOU HAVE IT...IT HAS BEEN ALMOST 13 YEARS SINCE THAT SIGHTING...I NEVER SAW IT WITH THE NAKED EYE, ONLY ON THE VIDEO TAPE....AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE...IT WAS MOVING VERY VERY FAST...IT CROSSES THE SCREEN IN A BLINK OF AN EYE...BUT SLOWED DOWN YOU CAN SEE IT VERY CLEARLY.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE OBJECT WAS...BUT I THINK IT MAY BE SOME SORT OF SECRET MILITARY PLANE....BUT WHO KNOWS. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
Low circular light/flying object and multi-directional changing lights in the sky;1993-12-15 02:00:00;1-2 minutes;Low circular light/flying object and multi-directional changing lights in the sky This is something that I experienced back when I believe I was 16/17. I was driving my girlfriend home one night, on Humboldt Rd. just passed over the highway heading away from the city. As we were driving up to the left I saw this circular light. The best way I can describe it would be that of light coming out of a lampshade that angles downward. This object was not very high, had absolutely no other lights such as a tail light on helicopters or any wing lights, and made absolutely no sound, or no sound we were aware of. The object travelled exactly the same speed as traffic. As soon as I saw it and realized it wasn't a glare or reflection I asked my girlfriend what the hell that was. She looked and watched it in awe. As we drove down the road watching it, it suddenly literally just took off. Instantly flew forward out of view, I've never seen anything move so fast in my life. It was very eerie, I felt excited because I knew I saw something that is very rare to see and something some people simply can't believe exists as they haven't experienced it themselves. I dropped her off and she too was shocked and knew she saw a UFO. I haven't seen anything of that nature since. However, in summer of '99 I was swimming in the backyard of a friends house around 3-4 a.m. when we saw a blinking light as far as the stars. Now, this blinking light we found very odd, especially the individual whose pool it was because he watches the stars a lot, because this light changed direction numerous amounts of times. We would watch this light blink once in one area of the sky. About a minute later it traveled I would say the length of the big dipper and blinked again. Then another minute later it would blink up in a total different area as it had changed course. We watched this object for approximately 20-30 minutes. Very odd. ((NUFORC Note:  Date, time, and duration of sighting all appear to be approximate.  PD));44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
Saw flashing lights in night sky that then appeared as large UFO;2011-06-13 01:00:00;15 minute;Saw flashing lights in night sky that then appeared as large UFO Ok so it took me a few years to report this but it is such a vivid memory that describing it now is just as easy as the night i saw it with my three friends.   To give a little background i was seeing strange lights in the sky for about a month before this date and would brag to friends that i was seeing multiple UFO's at night and at various locations wherever i was at.  I told a friend one night that i bet we would see strange lights at his house and what we saw that night changed out life forever.  It started at 9pm and we saw 3 strange white non blinking lights that flew through the night sky in strange directions then would simply vanish.  We observed these lights a few more times then around 1am we said lets look one more time for the lights then go to sleep.  Here is where the report gets very interesting and the real UFO appears.  At first we didn't see anything and thought maybe we should just go to bed, then we all saw a bright flash of light to the West in the sky.   We all asked each other if we had seen the same thing and then it happened again, only this time the flash appeared in the sky illuminating some very high clouds that seemed to appear out of no where.  Then in awe all three of us experienced one more bright flash in the sky and then three bright white stationary lights appeared behind the flash!  This flash would illuminate the sky and were owing from this disk shaped UFO with three lights at the top not flashing, and had a red and white chasing light that would flicker across this UFO.  Now the whole time this is happening, nature around us is going crazy! the birds at night are never loud and this night when this event was happening, it sounded like over 1000 birds were squawking and making loud sounds.  None of us could talk as this UFo started to slowly hover towards us at about 100 meters in the sky while never making a sound itself.  This continued for about 15 minutes then it stopped and almost at the speed o! f light vanished in the sky without a sound.  All three of us ran in the house after this happened and couldn't sleep.  We know we saw something spectacular that night and remember it to the day.  Also a strange side event was that i called my girlfriend shortly after seeing this and she picked up the phone immediately.  She was crying about a very vivid nightmare she had about alien abduction!  Now I had not told her what i saw in the sky that night yet so it was a very weird coinsidence that she had a dream about aliens.  I don't know but everything that happened that night was so strange and makes me wonder what is really out there that we don't know about yet!;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
