Triangular Pattern of lights over Lambeau Field 12/8/02;2002-12-08 17:30:00;1 minute;Triangular Pattern of lights over Lambeau Field 12/8/02 Just after arriving for the Packers/Vikings game a group of us noticed 3 white lights in a triangular pattern come above us and directly over Lambeau Field heading East to West. At first we thought it might be a plane leaving Austin Strabel Airport (several had passed over already), but there was no noticeable sound coming from the object. Due to the wind patterns aircraft had been cleared to take off and approach the airport directly over Lambeau (This was broadcast during the game.) Since it was dark at the time we seen the object we can only give a description of the pattern not the overall size or distance. Due to it being a prime time broadcast football game(ESPN) a group of us think it might have been some sort of surveillance aircraft, however I have decided to report it just in case.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205

09-28-09 Green Bay WI, Triangle Shape Object, 3 Lights on one side, One Light on the bottom side on the other, and red light in center.;2009-09-28 22:00:00;3-5 Min.;09-28-09 Green Bay WI, Triangle Shape Object, 3 Lights on one side, One Light on the bottom side on the other, and red light in center. On 09-28-09, my roommate and I left the apartment to quick run to the grocery store downtown Green Bay, WI. Driving down Main Street, my roommate pointed out the flying object that kept coming down from the sky closer and closer. We quick swung into a parking lot, and I got out of the car… the UFO was approximately only 60- 80 feet up. My roommate observed the UFO closely. As well as I did, but my adrenaline was going… and I told her to draw out what exactly she saw right the second we got back home. Around the time of 22:00, we BOTH saw a triangle shaped UFO, Three Lights on one side of the triangle, another light on the bottom of the triangle, and a red light in the center. It made no noise what so ever, and stopped in the air for about 10-15 seconds, as if it was just floating. We quickly went online after my roommate drew her sketch of the mystery we saw that night, but we knew what we saw, and we found drawings online of the SAME EXACT IDENTICAL object that we saw. Never have I believed in UFO’s or even had an interest in UFO’s in any years of my life I know that what I saw that night was unlike anything I’ve ever seen.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205

Drove northbound on us-41.  Half a mile from my exit see around 10 cars on side of the road out of their cars.  As i slow down i see a triangle shaped craft about 400 feet above the ground slowly hovering over the highway.  Zero sound 3 red lights.  Coming from northwest from Lake Michigan to southeast.  About 2 minutes later 3 helicopters followed behind full speed.  Make it known the closest air base which do not have these copters is K.I. Sawyer in the Upper peninsula of Michigan.  I have looked for a place to say this.  Never found a place where someone said this seen this.  I can run it in person everyday from work to my bed.  It was life changing!;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
30+ lights traveled low and silent over the city and a silent triangle shape with no belly strobe flew directly overhead.;2012-08-21 20:35:00;10 minutes;30+ lights traveled low and silent over the city and a silent triangle shape with no belly strobe flew directly overhead. We were in the Bellevue Wisconsin Home Depot parking lot putting our purchases into the truck when we saw 5 lights in the west flying in kind of a v or check mark formation.  My husband is a pilot and so of course interested in planes, we thought the formation was probably some kind of military planes or helicopters and we stopped to watch it.  We quickly noticed that there was no noise, if these were military jets or helicopters we would be able to hear them a good distance away, but there was no sound.  As we continued to watch, the lights did not change in size though they did move from the west and then turned to the north.  Behind these initial 5 came more and more, single file low over the city and then they would turn north and continue until they were out of our site.  These lights were not perfectly spaced, but they came one after another and we could see them coming from some distance away.  It was not like these were just coming up over a building into sight we could see them far in the distance come closer in a straight line, then turn north and eventually out of sight.  We did not keep an exact count, and as some would go out of sight we could see more coming, but we saw at a minimum 30, more likely 40 of these yellowish round non blinking lights move across the sky.  The sky was clear, mostly dark with the west horizon still reddish from the sun set, but stars were visible in the sky.  As we were standing there watching the lights, we noticed a light in the sky moving toward us from NW to SE.  As we looked at it we could tell that it was triangle shaped, but it was not airplane shaped.  We could not see stars behind it, it blocked the sky in a full triangle shape.  My husband being a pilot immediately noticed that while it did have blinking lights at the three triangle points, there was no belly strobe.  We could see the blinking belly strobe on other airliners high in the sky but not on this. Whatever was flying over us was large, completely silent and flying very slow and low.  My husband estimates that the aircraft was flying approximately 3000 feet off the ground, well less than 5000 ft. Our background:  We are both in our 40’s, employed full time in white collar jobs, we have two children ages 10 and 12, we were completely sober, not a drop to drink that night. My father is a very active private pilot, and while my husband does not have a current license he graduated from the North America Institute of Aviation in Las Cruces, NM in May 1991 with his Commercial Pilot license and CFI rating.  We are both familiar with aircraft and whatever we saw that night, we cannot explain.   This was the most bizarre experience we have ever had.  When the lights stopped, we got in the truck to drive home and I immediately called my dad (8:49pm CST) to see if he knew of any kind of aviation event going on in the area that might explain what we saw, but he did not.  When we got home I called the news stations (WBAY 920-438-3264 at 9:06pm)  (WFRV 800-236-5550 9:11pm) (WLUK 920-490-1407 9:28pm) and while no one knew what we saw, we were not the only ones who called.  The news stations said they had received multiple calls and it seems they were all from the same Bellevue/East Green Bay area we were in.  I called the Green Bay non emergency police number (920-391-7450 9:13pm).  While talking to the woman who answered my call, she said she needed to put me on hold for 911, I thought she was transferring me to 911 so I hung up.  A few minutes later (9:18pm) my phone rang, and it was the police calling me back, she explained that she had to put me on hold so she could take a 911 call.  She completed taking my information and! said they would get in contact with the airport and investigate.  I asked if it was possible to get any follow-up as I would love to have an explanation for what we saw, but she said she transferred the information to her supervisor and she would not know the outcome.  So far we have seen nothing in the news regarding what we saw, but we would love an explanation.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
Large black triangle craft passes overhead cloaked in strange clouds;2014-05-10 18:30:00;30 minutes;Large black triangle craft passes overhead cloaked in strange clouds Here are the details of my UFO encounter in Green Bay, WI on May 10th, 2014. My girlfriend and I were out in the backyard around 6:30 pm CDT cooking dinner on the grill when we noticed that a large group of strange looking clouds were headed our way and passed directly overhead. It had been a mostly sunny afternoon with few clouds in the area that day and this group really looked unusual so I started taking photographs of them for about 30 minutes. After looking at the photographs at a later time we noticed the outline and shadow of a large triangle shaped craft that was completely silent and was moving very slowly with the clouds. It seemed to us that these clouds were being generated by this craft as form of camouflage to hide it.  It slowly moved off to the Northeast. We live near the intersection of highway WI-172 and Webster Ave in Green Bay, WI.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
