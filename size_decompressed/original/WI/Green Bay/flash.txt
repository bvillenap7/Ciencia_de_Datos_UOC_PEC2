Flashing white about once every 15 to 20 seconds;2019-03-16 05:00:00;3-4 minutes;Flashing white about once every 15 to 20 seconds Location is about 2 miles NE of Green Bay,Wi  On the morning of March 16, 2019, at about 5 am cst (sic.  CDT) I looked out my bedroom window and saw a flashing white light to my North west. It was fairly low in the sky.  The light was flashing at about the rate of a airplane, however did not see any red or green lights that any aircraft should have. Then noticed a flash of white light nearer my location and higher in the sky. Watched sky for about 15 to 20 seconds when I saw another flash.  This flash was brighter than the stars around it.  It flashed about every 15 to 20 seconds for about 3 or 4  minutes.  It was moving East until it was blocked by my house roof. The light flashing was not like any airplane and again there was no red or green lights like required on aircraft. I am a retired cellular tech.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
