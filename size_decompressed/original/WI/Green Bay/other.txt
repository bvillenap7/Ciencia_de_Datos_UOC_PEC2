Stealth shaped object. No lights and NO sound.;2002-04-13 21:45:00;5 sec;Stealth shaped object. No lights and NO sound. Stealth Shaped object moving from east to west.  Seemed to be flying at about 1000 - 2000 ft above ground level.  The object was dark, possibly metalic.  No lights visible on the object. NO sound what so ever. Object seemed to reflect some light from the ground (just enough to make out the shape).  I thought I was looking at a low flying plane but it didn't make any sound and had no lights.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
T-Shaped silent craft traveling northwest over Green Bay sky.;2003-08-13 22:20:00;3 minutes;T-Shaped silent craft traveling northwest over Green Bay sky. While looking at the moon and trying to find the planet mars (which was to be close to the earth that night). My wife and i happened to stare at the sky and stars above when we noticed an object that appeared to be moving. After taking a second glance this T-shaped object was moving from the southeast to the northwest. It was higher than that of an airplane yet not as high as what the stars would be. It had a row of lights in the front that were red and yellowish in color. The lights were twinkling rather fast and behind that was a glob of lights (same color as front row of lights). Whatever this object was it made no sound and moved steadily through the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the wife of this witness, and it is our belief that the couple may have witnessed something quite unusual.  We would welcome reports from anyone else who might have witnessed the object.  PD));44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
Odd Constellation Dances in Sky for 20 Minutes, then Returns to Original Odd Constellation Form.;2013-09-16 00:00:00;15 minutes;Odd Constellation Dances in Sky for 20 Minutes, then Returns to Original Odd Constellation Form. After coming home from a late movie, I was in the backyard finishing up a phone conversation with my brother who was in Breckendridge, MN.  I looked up in the sky to see a weird formation of what I thought was stars in the sky.  The odd star formation wasn't a constellation I had ever seen before.  It was two oddly shaped triangles right on top of each other, 6x dots in the sky that I thought were stars.  Another odd observation, though the dots almost were identical to the rest of the stars in the sky, they had a slight flicker to them.  One triangle looked like a small crooked Orion's Belt with two dots in a row with the third being slighting out of the straight line.  The other was a triangle with an elongated left hand corner.  After about 10 minutes of looking at the formation, the 6x dots very slightly started moving.  It was so slight I thought my mind was playing tricks on me.  Then they started moving in a slow motion most comparable to electrons, bu! t the motion was more random like fireflies. I had been giving my brother a play by play of what I had been seeing and then I coerced him to go outside to try and see what I was seeing, even though he was in Breckenridge MN.  I said he saw something similar but he saw red and blue lights.  After about 10 minutes,  I went inside to try and wake my wife up so she could also witness what I had been seeing.  I returned outside and I saw that the 6x dots had returned to their original 2x triangle positions.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
