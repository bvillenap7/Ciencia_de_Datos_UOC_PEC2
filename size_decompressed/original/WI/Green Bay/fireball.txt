Fast moving fireball, accompanied by low hum.;2014-08-15 21:00:00;1 minute;Fast moving fireball accompanied by low hum. It came over the horizon from the Southwest and headed Northeast.  We all started looking at it around the same time.  We were very surprised because it didn't behave like anything we had ever seen in the sky before.  It was moving faster than a plane.  It seemed close under 10,000 feet.  The quality of the light was warm like fire and it twinkled slightly.  There was also a low hum that accompanied it.  It seemed to be traveling very smoothly and gaining altitude slightly as it moved out of our view.  It then disppeared into what looked like a very black dot an area much darker than the surrounding night sky.  About 20 min later it appeared again, this time stationary in the sky.  It expanded slightly and again disappeared into a black dot.  Only I saw it the second time.  The rest of the group had already left.  We had no experience of missing time or contact with the object.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
