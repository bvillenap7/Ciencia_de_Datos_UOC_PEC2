While enjoying the fireworks on a hill showing the entire city of Green Bay,  I noticed a small red/orange sphere in the sky that I initially assumed was another firework.  However, it didn't explode it only got closer and bigger.  In an instant it was over the city of Green Bay, moving very slowly for a few seconds, before trailing off and out of sight.   My entire group of friends sitting with me was silent for a few seconds before one asked Did anyone else see that?‚Äù  He was immediately met with agreement from the whole group.   The whole event couldn't have lasted over 20 seconds;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
My girlfriend & i were out late black friday shopping 2016.;2016-11-29 11:30:00;1 minute;My girlfriend & i were out late black friday shopping 2016. We were in my 2003 doge ram pick up. We were turning off military ave. into the parking lot inbetween sears and cvs on greenbays west side. When my trucks front tires initially drove up onto the parkinglots driveway it was at an elevated pitch wich subtly angled my trucks windshield up towards the sky briefly as we pulled into the parkinglot. At that moment the front end of the truck tilted upwards . Out the corner of my right eye ,i seen a bright red light that popped out of the middle of thin air about 40 feet above the sears building on west mason st . Initially it was a semi transparent bright red orb that i seen pop out thin air . However immediately after the one red orb popped out the red orb split into two(2) orbs now.. one red and one green. Both the orbs then began to do what id call Re-Igniting sum kind of fusion failure . Both orbs seemed to be trying to regenerate/reboot a fusion spark as both were igniting back and forth with one orb moving forward abit then then other moving forward abit past that. Then instantaneously they both caught the charge im assuming the ship needed and immediately like went into a warp speed and were gone like in the movies . This all happened in less then 20-30 secs. I also seen a mothership sail over us a few yrs prior that theres multiple witnesses to. Our news stations have a sky cam amd the Green Bay Packers have a cam on their stadium that can see that area of sky. Maybe someone is able to retrive footage from then.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
