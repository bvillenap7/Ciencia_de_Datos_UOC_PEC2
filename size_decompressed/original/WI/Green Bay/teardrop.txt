It traveled rather slow around the sky back, forth and up and down gradually settle in a east by northeast steady and slow.  we lost it in the trees scrambled up the block to see where it went.  that was the end of the encounter.  We had no film camera or video epuipment.  My wife tried to take a picture with her phone but could not get it in her viewfinder.   I have no idea what we just saw but I feel we really saw something special and exciting.  I wonder could you watch for other reports in our area.   thank you;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
