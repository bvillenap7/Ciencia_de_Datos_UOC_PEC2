Long, egg-shaped, reflective, silent craft overflies west Green Bay.;2008-10-22 21:30:00;2 minutes;Long, egg-shaped, reflective, silent craft overflies west Green Bay. APPROX 9:30 PM.  I was standing outside on my front porch having a cigarette. this is just a few blocks from Interstate 41 and West Mason street.  It was a typical fall evening.  Rather cloudy, cloud deck was low, but illuminated by city lights.  I was facing west, when out of the corner of my left eye I noticed something moving. upon focusing on the object I noticed it was a reflective elongated (stretched) egg shaped craft.  it moved into the clouds then out of the clouds.  the craft was moving perfectly horizontally I guesstimate it's speed at about 60 miles per hour, at an altitude of about 750 feet I estimate the craft's length at approx. 100-150 feet  with a diameter of about  50 feet.  It made no noise and gave off no light. It was not a blimp, it simply reflected the ambient light that was around it... it passed in between the clouds moving from south to north until it vanished.  entire event lasted only  2-3 minutesâ€¦;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
