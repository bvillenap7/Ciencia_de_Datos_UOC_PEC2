16 orange lights In Slope Formation Near Pamperin Park.   ((anonymous report));2017-03-18 22:58:00;minutes;16 Orange Lights In Slope Formation Near Pamperin Park Heading westbound on Business Highway 29 near Pamperin Park, I sighted about 16 orange lights, aligned in twos vertically, forming an upward slope in a pattern that looked like ski slope lights.  They appeared to start their formation about 50 feet above the trees and slope up another 150 feet they were positioned above the subdivision North of Riverdale Dr.   There were at least two of the lights moving in and out of the formation.  I turned off at the Sherwood St exit and turned left onto Hillcrest Rd., in an attempt to find a vantage point where I could take a picture, but the trees were blocking my view of their last position.   I then got back onto the highway heading eastbound in and only saw one orange light remaining as I passed their previous location.  I headed into Pamperin Park in hopes to get somewhere underneath the orange light but upon arrival that one was gone too.  I donâ€™t know how long they had been visible, but it was clearly seen from the highway when I passed.

Multiple red lights moving across the sky in what looked like a formation.;2017-09-16 21:15:00;15 minutes;Multiple red lights moving across the sky in what looked like a formation. At about 9:00 PM, on the night of 9/16/2017, as I walked onto my deck, I noticed red  lights in the sky moving North.  They looked like red orbs with a less prominent white light at the bottom.  They emerged from a cloud in a straight line either two or three side by side. They disappeared after entering another cloud.  It looked like a caravan of some kind.   Sometimes there would be a gap in the formation and sometimes only one light would emerge from the cloud.  The last one I saw was a single light.  This went on for about 15 minutes and there had to be over twenty or thiry of these lights.   They were moving at about the altitude and speed (maybe a little slower) of a small aircraft.  They were flying into the flight path of landing aircraft and I was glad no aircraft were landing at that time.;44.5274252772918;-88.0413619381205
