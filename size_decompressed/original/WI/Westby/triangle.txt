triangle going due n.e from the middel of persious;1999-08-13 03:58:00;1 min.;triangle going due n.e from the middel of persious I was watching the meteor shower last night when I started watching what looked like a satilite in the center of Persious going due N.E. when I realized there were two other satilites in front of it which made a backwards flying triangle (base first) covering about a half a degree of sky.  I wached for approx. one half min hopping it would get to the next stars so I could see if they were covered but we were having a lot of low, fast moving, puffy clouds and it was covered before I could see if it was solid.  I checked DLR and there were no satilites going that direction at that time.;43.6644;-90.8767
