((anonymous report));2016-09-26 03:30:00;5 minutes;I woke up to my dog crying and barking, I noticed through my bedroom window a round bright light, I grabbed my iPhone and proceeded outside to snap a picture.  This object had no sound, I am using my camera on my iphone zooming in to capture more detail.  The object seemed to have 3 parts with the inner parts moving, it hovered for awhile in the same spot, I then tried to take a video, when I tried to adjust the zoom to get video closer it just disappeared.   It looked to be about 200 to 300 yards up in my front yard.  It was bigger then a plane and very bright with no noise.  It seemed to be a clear night as I could see stars way off in the distance.
