While sitting in a farmers field the two of us saw a small shape in the distance slowly moving towards us.  Suddenly it seemed to be 10 feet away. There was many different colors coming off of it and it was changing shapes.  After about 5 minutes the shape disappeared into the sky.;44.6611;-88.2634
