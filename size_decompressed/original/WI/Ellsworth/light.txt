They stopped their car on the side of the road to look. After about 10 minutes four red balls of light came from the white object and started to zig zag around it in 90 degree angles.  This went on for about 5 minutes then the red balls of light went back into the bright white ball of light.  After about a minute the white ball of light slowly moved up then shot straight up and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));44.7233;-92.4945
