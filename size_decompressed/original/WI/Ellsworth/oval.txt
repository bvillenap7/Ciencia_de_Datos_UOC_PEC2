Tic tac ufo over Ellsworth Wisconsin;2019-07-15 14:30:00;3 minutes;Tic tac ufo over Ellsworth Wisconsin My daughter molly and I, saw this tic tac ufo hovering over the outskirts of Ellsworth Wisconsin and flew off to the west,  slowly. I was an aircraft mechanic for a multitude of different aircraft,  I worked at a naval air test center, no, insignia, no flight control surfaces, no visual propulsion or exhaust.  I have no idea what it was, but I do know it's not an aircraft.. Not from this planet anyway.;44.7233;-92.4945
