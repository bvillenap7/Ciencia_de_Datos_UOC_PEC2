Extremely large &quotPulsing&quot light event.;2012-12-13 18:30:00;20 seconds;Extremely large &quotPulsing&quot light event Standing outside my home enjoying a smoke and looking at the stars about 6:30pm, Dec. 13th, 2012. Clear skies. Looking north I found Cassiopeia and shifted my view southwest to Cygnus. I saw a small private plane moving northwest from Draco. As I was tracking the plane, a large sphere appeared just to the south west of Cygnus.  It then faded in a pulsing fashion.  I thought it might have been sunlight reflecting on a satellite, yet the light was at least the same magnitude as Jupiter and five (5) times the diameter.  Light color was white. Just  after that thought, the light pulsed on again, slightly moving to the southeast.  Both times the light pulsed on and off while moving.  Time between pulses was about 3 seconds. By this time the small plane was in the immediate area of the event and the light again pulsed on and off while still moving southeast. End of event. Duration: 20 seconds. After the event I remember the shape of the object was slightly oval in the plane horizontal to my view.  I also got the impression that the object was higher than the small planes altitude (approx. 3,500') since the plane never reacted to the pulses.  Visually the object traveled about 2/3rds the way from the center cross star of Cygnus southeast towards the star at end of the cross.;43.3953;-87.8812
