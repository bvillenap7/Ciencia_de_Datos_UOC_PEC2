I was driving home on a back country highway when I saw one light appear in the sky.  At first I thought it was a shooting start but it stayed a glow and was to big to be a distant start.  Seconds after I saw about 6 identical lights appear after the previous in a straight horizontal line. Then all at once all six lights disappeared at the same time. I’ve never seen anything like it and had chills and goosebumps run down my spine. I’ve always been intrigued and believed in UFO sightings etc but NEVER thought I’d see one. Beside myself.  The lights that appeared were white and large.  Looked as if the size of a small tennis tennis ball in the sky. They didn’t all light up at once. They followed in sequence after the other.;43.769;-89.3586
