I watched for a full five minutes to see if the orb was really just a fireball flame from the fireworks.  It made no sound either.   This orb kept its shape and continuously floated about and then slowly headed North by Northwest direction.   I witnessed this event and four other elderly people saw it too.;45.5054999999997;-91.7311999999996
White fireball round-like orb of light.;2015-09-04 01:00:00;90 seconds;white fireball round-like orb of light I was leaving a nightclub on 27 West Eau Claire Street and was walking East on Eau Claire Street at around 12:45 AM.  As I was walking, I looked up into the sky and noticed a very bright white fireball quietly streak across the midnight sky coming from the West direction heading East.  I had never seen a fireball streak across so low to the ground as this.  I watched closely to see if it would hit any buildings.  I estimate it was traveling at a very high speed and did leave fireball dust behind and its elevation was about 750 feet above me.   I watched it travel for about 1 1/2 minutes.  It kept a straight path and never fizzled out.  It was traveling alone and not accompanied by any military aircraft.   I waited and to see if another fireball was coming as well.  I am still uncertain if this was a UFO or a meteor but I will say that I was amazed.;45.5054999999997;-91.7311999999996
