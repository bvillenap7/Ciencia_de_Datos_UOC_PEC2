A bright green glowing circle;2010-12-10 04:30:00;7  min;A bright green glowing circle I will start this off by saying that i have never been a believer in UFOS.  I am a stay at home mom of four daughter and my husband is a roofer.   Every morning I wake up at about 4 am to get my family ready for the day.  On this morning I was outside my house smoking when i noticed a weird sound kinda like a humming music but differnt then i noticed a bright green light.   I watched for a while and realized that it was moving.  I stuck my head in the door to see if i could wake up my husband which was asleep on the couch and when i looked back the bright green object had seperated into two green objects and the weird noise had stopped.  One bright green object going strait up and the other one was going strait down.  I watched for a while in amazement not knowing what to really say or do.  Then in a blink of an eye they were gone!  With no trace.  I watched the sky for about 15 mins after that without seeing anything again and then went to wake my husband up to tell him what I had seen.
