Small fast moving star UFO, disappeared and then reapeared in different part of the sky,;2012-07-14 22:00:00;30 minutes;Small fast moving star UFO, disappeared and then reapeared in different part of the sky, I believe I've seen very small looking UFO's.   My boyfriend and I were sitting on my porch at around 10 pm and noticed these small lights zooming around in the sky, like fast moving little stars or something.  They would go in little circles and curlicues and then dissapear and reapear in another part of the sky, I think there were two of them.   They were way too fast to be a jet or plane, and they flew in patterns/circles like I said, so there's no way it was a bird either, and they were too far away, not to mention the lights.  It was so crazy we watched them for like almost an hour, I've never seen anything like it, they just kept disappearing and reapearing all over the place, it was....phenomenal.   I just saw one tonight, just for a second then it was gone, which made me decide to ask google if anyone else had seen them, lol.  Also, the lights were just white, no red, and it almost looked like the lights were spinning, if you know what I mean, but they were too! far away to really tell.  I'm trying so think of more ways to describe them, but all I know for sure is that I don't know of anything that moves that way, definitely too fast for a satellite, etc.  Maybe we aren't alone in the universe after all... :) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Red orb light seen changing colors.;2017-07-04 21:46:00;3.5 minutes;Red orb light seen changing colors On July 4th, 2017, at 21:46 hours, I was sitting on the benches waiting for the fireworks display to begin.  While watching the skies, I noticed a red orb light slowly moving from the North East across the lake from where I was sitting which was at Lakeshore Drive and East Humbird Street. When I spotted this red light moving about slowly, I noticed it was moving in a slow vertical pattern and then it started moving in circles.  It began turning into the colors green, white, and blue.  It continued doing this for 3.5 minutes and then disappeared.;45.5054999999997;-91.7311999999996
Approximately 10:15 p.m. on a country road east of Rice Lake WI, two different occurrences within 10 minutes.;2017-08-07 22:15:00;10 minutes;Approximately 10:15 p.m. on a country road east of Rice Lake, WI, two different occurrences within 10 minutes.   Both objects were very slow moving, bright, orange-colored lights, and then disappeared without warning. both came from the West going towards the east.   We have seen these lights at different times during the night and daytime several times in the past six months, especially the light is so bright you cannot tell if there is a shape to it, but at times, there's more than one at a time.;45.5054999999997;-91.7311999999996
3 stationary red flashing lights in the Western sky.;2019-09-10 20:35:00;5 minutes;3 stationary red flashing lights in the Western sky. Noticed 3 stationary red lights in the Western Skies.  They never moved, but they were in a line and disappeared one by one in a line about 20-30 seconds apart.  They appeared to be flashing very slightly, and just before they disappeared they turned white and flickered away.;45.5054999999997;-91.7311999999996
