If they were 4 lights on the bottom of a craft, it would have been the size of California. Took about 60 seconds from the time they cam into the field of view until we could no longer see them. We were thinking meteor shower?  But it didn't add up.  It was way to clean and the and the space demand a perfect equal distanceâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Space X satellites?
