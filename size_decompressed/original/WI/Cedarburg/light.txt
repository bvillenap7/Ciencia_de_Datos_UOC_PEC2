rather bright shaking light moving in a north west to south east direction;2006-07-04 21:30:00;45-60 seconds;rather bright shaking light moving in a north west to south east direction While sitting in our yard waiting to view the local fireworks show, we caught glimpse a rather bright light moving in a north west to south east direction.  at first we thought it was a satellite, which we have seen hundreds of but this was different and seemed rather low in the atmosphere, as we had also seen a few very high flying planes in the area this evening as well.  There was no sound, no flashing/blinking lights, but while it flew it seemed as if it were shaking or moving in a side to side manner, while still continuing in the nw-se direction.  There were 7 of us who watched this (5 adults, 2 children). Us adults were quite amazed and it left us all wondering what it was we had just seen.  I can tell you that we are all 100% sure this was not any firework, or anything of that matter. There were hundreds of people in the vicinity and we are hoping that someone else has seen the same thing we did and will report it as well.;43.3032999999996;-88.0017000000006
Two amber lights over Cedarburg, WI.;2011-07-23 21:34:00;1 minute;Two amber lights over Cedarburg, WI. My location was N43.309008,W87.974691 The time was 21:34 I saw two amber lights to the WNW of me and at an inclination of 20 degrees. If I put my arm out for reference, they were a hand's width apart (3 degrees?). The two objects had a heading of 70-90 degrees. They moved faster than the wind could have been carrying them. The lights were as bright as the landing lights on commercial aircraft when seen from a distance of 5 miles. There was no sound. I watched them for about 1 minute before they disappeared. The objects were about due north of me when they disappeared.;43.3032999999996;-88.0017000000006
Single bright white/yellow flickering light that at first appeared to be a star, but it was too bright and seemed to be weaving and bob;2012-01-30 18:20:00;30 minutes;Single bright white/yellow flickering light that at first appeared to be a star, but it was too bright and seemed to be weaving and bobbing through the air much too fast to be a plane or a helicopter.it was not moving in any fixed direction, just making movements side to side and up and down at speeds unnatural for any common aircraft. from where i was it was to the south east and appeared to be over lake Michigan just east of Milwaukee.  I am 21, a mechanic, and cannot explain what i saw. my parents, both 57, (a small business owner/mechanic and an accountant) had no explanation as well;43.3032999999996;-88.0017000000006
