Fireball Seen in Sky;2011-08-20 20:45:00;2 minutes;Fireball Seen in Sky The object was moving north at a moderate speed.  It suddenly stopped, and hovered for a moment.  Then, it looked like it changed direction and headed upward east because it became smaller and smaller until we could not see it any longer.;43.3032999999996;-88.0017000000006
9 orange fireballs track across sky.;2012-11-17 19:00:00;20 minutes;9 orange &quotfireballs&quot track across sky 7:00 PM My wife and I were standing on our deck when a strange very bright orange ball apppeared in the southern sky.  Soon several appeared following on the same track. The objects tracked from the southeast to the northwest flying directly over our location.  Each was in view for 1 to 2 minutes and there were 9 total.  The distance between them was relativly consistant as well as the speed.  They were at a low altitude no more than a few thousand feet and they made no sound.  Looking through the binoculars they looked like bright orange fireballs.;43.3032999999996;-88.0017000000006
8 red/orange fireball objects, evenly spaced;2012-11-17 19:13:00;9 minutes;8 red/orange fireball objects, evenly spaced We saw (8) evenly spaced fireball-like objects, traveling at an absolutely even pace...a group of three gathered at the &quotend point&quot of where we saw them, and vanished. They were all identical.  Red, orange, sphere-like torch end in appearance, and after the first 3 to 4, we could actually count when the next one would appear...and then they stopped.  They seemed to be going slow, and appeared to be in our{ atmosphere, not high in the sky, and totally silent.   We are husband and wife, we were in 2 different rooms, doing separate activities, wife got up and went outside for no apparent reason, called husband after counting the first 5, and he witnessed the last 3.;43.3032999999996;-88.0017000000006
