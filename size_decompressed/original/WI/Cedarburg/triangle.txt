As I had just stepped outside to have a smoke, I saw three orange-color, triangular-shaped, objects floating soundlessly in the sky, in one line, from SW to NE, followed by what appeared to be a jet. The objects had no sound but the jet had engine sound. They then all disappeared from my sight behind tall trees.;43.3032999999996;-88.0017000000006
