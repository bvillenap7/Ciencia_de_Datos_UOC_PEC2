Immobile teardrop object in the west near evening.;2004-08-19 20:00:00;01:25;Immobile teardrop object in the west near evening. I went outside for a minute when I saw a very bright object that looked like a star in the west. I am an amateur astronomer and I knew that there weren't any stars over there, at that time. I ran an got my telescope and when I focused on it at 125x, I could see a transparent teardrop/sphere object just sitting. It never moved at all for the duration, but after the sun had gone far enough below the horizon, it faded to an orangeish yellow, then finally disappeared for good. I had called my friend just a mile away and in his telescope he could see the exact same thing. His whole family could see it as well. While we were observing it, the streetlights went out for just a second. Also, while I was on the phone, we could hear a pulsating (sp?) buzzing noise in the background that lasted about 10 seconds. It is a 2.4 GHz cordless telephone. We knew that after we had seen the object fade with the sun setting that it had to be in the vicinity of the Earth, perhaps the upper atmosphere, and not a supernova, comet, asteroid, meteor, etc.;44.8554;-92.6308

I posted one on 8/24/04 stating that I saw a very bright object in the sky over in the western sky area on 8/19/04 (I'm from river falls wisconsin). My telescope showed a very strange teardrop object which remained for a few hours. I am posting one again because I saw the exact same thing , but much higher in the sky (hence closer to where I live), but this was a bit different. I ran to get my telescope, put it outside, turned it on, and bam! it was just gone. It couldn't have been there for more than 1 minute, but I swear to God, whatever that thing was, it knew I was about to look at it with my scope and immediately fled. I don't know why the object didn't flee when it was over such a large city. I have one more thing to say: the other UFO reports in this data base where low-flying craft have been spotted are probably just military craft. If they were aliens, why would they fly so close to the ground, and in plain sight, if their goal was secrecy? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));44.8554;-92.6308
