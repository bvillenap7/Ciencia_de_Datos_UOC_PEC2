I looked out my east window and saw a gold cigar shaped object tilted slightly in the northeast sky.   I returned to the window approx. 10 min. later.  There was a round object on the ground approx 2 blocks from the farmhouse along Hwy 10.  It was huge.   As I watched it seemed to tilt backwards.  It became elliptical in shape.  As I watched it appeared to have a dome with a slightly different shade of gold - slightly  lighter with trapezoidial shapes on the dome.   I kept watching and it was just like a 3 way light bulb.  It  became a lighter shade 2nd time lighter than dark.  I thought I saw a door, but I'm not certain.  I stood trying to see it but it was all dark.  I did not know where to report this until the program on tv last night.;44.8554;-92.6308
