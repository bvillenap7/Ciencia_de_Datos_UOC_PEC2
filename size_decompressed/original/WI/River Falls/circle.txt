We were sitting in the back yard, having a bonfire.  We looked to the south horizon and observed a bright orange ball of light approaching in the sky.  As it passed over us it made no sound, moving at a high rate of speed from south to north.  As we watched for approx. 2 min. it fade into the distance. we then looked back to the south and saw the same thing again. there were a total of six objects, each about 2 to 3 min. apart.  We live in Altoona, WI. and on 7/4/13, we observed the same orange ball of light go over our house, from south to north, this time only one object.  Does any body know what they are?;44.8554;-92.6308

A friend and I were driving home and the entire drive there was a large circular ball of orange light, we both don’t have a clue what this could have been and it seemed to lower from the sky in the west near the Twin Cities.  We both tried to find any sort of logical explanation for it but we couldn’t.;44.8554;-92.6308
