Glowing silvery orb/sphere over Wautoma, Wisconsin numerous days and times;2012-10-03 14:45:00;2 minutes;Glowing silvery orb/sphere over Wautoma, Wisconsin numerous days and times My husband and I came out of a store on main street and witnessed a glowing sphere darting around the sky from North to South, East to West, before traveling to the South and disappearing past a treeline.  Another couple stopped their car to watch.  There were aircraft that seemed to be circling the object they moved out of sight when it did. My husband observed the same object on the 6th of October just north of our home outside the city limits.  This follows sightings of glowing orbs darting above our treeline and through our property during the months of August and September.  There was no noise and the movement is always erratic and fast.;44.0681999999999;-89.2636000000002
