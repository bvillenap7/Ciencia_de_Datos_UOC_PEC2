Two bright lights in the evening sky;2005-09-19 20:01:00;3 seconds;Two bright lights in the evening sky Two bright lights appeared in the sky. About a 45 degree angle as I was traveling south on Highway 22. They appeared quite large. It looked like they were some distance apart but in the same line horizontally. The lights were quite bright in the darkened sky (just before the moon rose)and very noticeable. These bright lights went out as quickly as they appeared, like shutting off a light bulb. But they went out simultaneously about a half a second apart. I watched the sky for the next hour as I continued to travel south to Pardeeville in Columbia County.;44.0681999999999;-89.2636000000002
