Four lighted objects with irregular flashing light with erractic flight pattern, occasionally emitting bright flare like flashes.;2005-09-21 21:00:00;45 minutes;Four lighted objects with irregular flashing light with erractic flight pattern, occasionally emitting bright flare like flashes. At dusk we noticed what appeared to be to bright flares in the southern sky, the burned for only 3-4 secounds. Then we noticed fast moving objects with irregular flashing light patterns moving away from flares. Objects would darken for a couple of seconds and then be up or down a large distance in an erractic pattern traveling through the sky when flashing resumed. Travel speed and rapid change of direction was inconsistent with that of normal aircraft, fighter jets do not move up and down and across the sky that quickly.  Objects would move East and West then return to center of our viewing area (facing south) occassionally two or three bright bursts of light could be seen in their trail of flight. After about 25 minutes a jet could be heard, it was fast as you would expect a fighter jet to be, the lights had a regular blinking pattern, it circled above and moved towards the blinking light objects and seemed to pursue one of them to the east horizon, the jet followed the object out of view.  The objects reappeared, there were four, more flashes went off. By this time clouds were blowing in and visability became difficult and we could no longer follow the objects visually.;44.0681999999999;-89.2636000000002
A bright kelly green light in the southern horizon.;2007-05-01 21:00:00;3-5 seconds;A bright kelly green light in the southern horizon. Driving south on Highway (WI) 22, about 3-5 miles south from Wautoma. A full moon was in the east. A bright kelly green light suddenly appeared in the sky somewhat above my vehicle. It shown brightly for a few seconds, then suddenly a smaller bright white light appeared just for a second, then both lights were out. There were no clouds for the lights to disappear into which left me wondering where it came from or the direction, but nothing else to be seen.  With a full moon, the visibility was very good but saw nothing else except these lights.  A year or two ago, I had reported seeing two very large bright white lights close to this same area.;44.0681999999999;-89.2636000000002
