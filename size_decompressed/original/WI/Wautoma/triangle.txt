It is very rural about 70 miles east of Fort McCoy, a military training base. Last evening at approximately 9:30 I stepped out on to the back deck to hot tub for a short time.  I looked to the skies when I heard a jet over head at breaking the sound barrier speed, but never saw it as it was very overcast last night.  The plane was traveling from the west to east. About the same time as I looked to the east, further to the north of the plane I saw 3 bright lights in a triangular formation.  It was not 10 seconds later when they each “exploded” and disappeared.  Please not that this all happened in about 30 seconds.  About the same time I heard the plane circle around and head back to the west. Have there been any other reports of this kind from Wisconsin last night?;44.0681999999999;-89.2636000000002
