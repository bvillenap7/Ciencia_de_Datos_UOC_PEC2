Triangular chevron formation of three dim, orange objects--second sighting!;2012-03-14 23:53:00;5 seconds;Triangular chevron formation of three dim, orange objects--second sighting! Previously reported a similar incident almost exactly one year ago.   This three-object chevron was much closer together (approximately twice the apparent width as a full moon) than previous report.  The objects were each a dark orange and I would have missed seeing them entirely had I not been looking at Mars.  These three objects were much dimmer than Mars, and were traveling from due south to due north.  They made no sound and left no contrail as they passed almost directly overhead and transited the sky from a 45-degree elevation to about a 30-degree elevation from the southern and northern horizon, respectively.  The formation was an almost perfect isosceles triangle, with no positional deviation of any of the three objects relative to the other two during the sighting.  This was a formation and not a solid object as I observed a star through the center of the formation which was not obscured as it would be with a solid object.;42.5881;-88.4554000000002
