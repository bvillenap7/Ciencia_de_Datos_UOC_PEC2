As it approached approximate even with moon seemed to stop and hang in air. Is very high in the sky.Moved enough to indicate that it was not the chance of a star that was sighted. All other stars that are out do not show any of this movement. The sighting was in a perfectly clear portion of the sky near the moon even though there is clouds present. Moving Object (from Southeast going West) wasbright/clear. Object/Light seemed to be round however it was so high it was hard to becertain. The object moved in straight line forprobably 3-5 minutes then turned slightlyNorthwest and just seemed to stop and hang.Only one object/light was seen. Both of usare 59 years old and teachers. I (husband)spent 24 years in the u.s. air force. Time nowis 2117 and the object is still sitting still near the moon in clear sky. The moon is in the Southeast since this all started.;42.5881;-88.4554000000002
Two bright amber lights flying in diagnol formation over downtown under a full moon;2005-09-17 01:30:00;15mins;Two bright amber lights flying in diagnol formation over downtown under a full moon Two very bright amber colored lights in diagonal formation, one on the lower left and the other on the upper right.  Light was seen by others hours before moving above the lake in figure eight motion.  When I saw the lights, the sky was clear and bright due to a full moon.  I was standing on a patio in the middle of town with approximately 30-50 people, who all saw the same thing.  It flew right over us and they appeared to be half the size of the moon and were very bright and silent.  There is no way to tell exactly what they were. After they did figure eights they went back into formation, headed west and got smaller and then dissapeared.  I do not believe that there is a man made craft that can fly in such a motion.  They were moving slowly, so I got in my car with a friend to try to chase them down, but they were no where to be found.  These objects have been seen in this area by others over the last couple of weeks, during different hours of the night.  I have never seen anything like this.;42.5881;-88.4554000000002
BRIGHT, GOLD, FLYING BALL. Moving from one horizon to overhead to up and away at a constant speed;2005-09-18 01:00:00;10 minutes;BRIGHT, GOLD, FLYING BALL. Moving from one horizon to overhead to up and away at a constant speed While sitting,looking out over Lake Geneva a bright gold ball of light rose over the horizon and moved out over the lake. It passed over head and then turned slightly and headed northeast until it was completly out of sight in the sky.It flickered a little bit as if it was fire burning. There were no blinking lights on it and it appeared the same from all sides just a perfect ball of light. No sound! It moved at the same steady speed the entire time. When it was gone we turned back around to where we first saw itr and there was another one exactly the same and traveled the indentical path of the first one. We waited for a third for over an hour but it never came. When we got home we called the police first just to see if there were any reports of this and the officer who answered the phone said that they had recieved a number of calls and that officers on the beat around the town had been seeing them all night.

Bright light in Lake Genva sky-not a star or plane.  ((NUFORC Note:  If the witness was looking west, the object was Venus.  PD));2009-01-20 20:00:00;20 min.;Bright light in Lake Genva sky-not a star or plane. Getting off Hwy. 43 heading on to 120 towards Lake Geneva, WI approx. 7pm I noticed a bright light in the sky to the right of my vehicle. First thought was it was possibly the north star, but I realized it wasn't in the north, it was actually west of Hwy. 120, seeing it through the passenger window. It appeared to not be moving like a plane would. It was just sitting in midair, bright white light. I kept watching it until I got near Lake Geneva and parked up on the hill before the golf course. Watched it outside my window, heard no noise from it. I then proceeded home, as I was close to Hwy. 12 I saw it again on the right side as if it moved quickly to stay with me. I followed it in the sky all the way to my home, where it sat as I called my wife and daughter to come out and look at it. It lasted for another 10 min. From my vantage point, I seemed to have a greenish tint with a reddish tint bottom. I watched the light shrink to a speck of light, disappeared and came back, almost immediately, but not as bright as earlier. Then the light shrank again until it slowly flickered out. Noticed quick like shaky circular movement at times, but it did not seem to move much. I have seen this same light before in New Berlin, maybe 20 years ago.

5 orange balls of light moving off towards the southwest of Lake Geneva Wi.;2013-08-31 20:45:00;20-30 seconds;5 orange balls of light moving off towards the southwest of Lake Geneva Wi. I was driving my semi-truck in a northwesterly direction on hwy.12 about 3 miles north of the city of LakeGeneva Wi.When I observed a formation of 5 orange balls of light,I first thought they were not moving but then I realized they were travelling in a southwesterly direction.They crossed over the highway about the time I got there but I could not guess the height that they were at. I continued to watch them in my mirrors as I travelled up the road, till I lost sight of them.;42.5881;-88.4554000000002
Light that changed rapid colors, made its self like thread like appearance.;2014-09-03 21:25:00;30  seconds;Light that changed rapid colors, made its self like thread like appearance. Light that made its self thinner and moved fast sideways, while changed different colors ...until finally disappeared behind a tree.  Right after it was a plane.  I honestly couldn't tell if it was chasing it or not, but there's so etching strange about that coincidence. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It was at 9:25 pm, thank you so much for the advice will do!
