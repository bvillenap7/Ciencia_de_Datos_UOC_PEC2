Loud, long, low pitched rumbling over Geneva Lake, WI.;2015-03-14 22:45:00;2 minutes;Loud, long, low pitched rumbling over Geneva Lake, WI. We didn't actually see a craft but heard a loud rumbling thunder, very close, that last over 2 minutes.  It upset the cat even.   I thought the lake ice was cracking and my husband thought it was an aircraft.  We didn't see any aircraft and there was not a storm.   I cannot find any records of anyone else hearing this noise.;42.5881;-88.4554000000002
