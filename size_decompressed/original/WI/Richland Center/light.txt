Electromagnetic fields????!!!!;2019-08-07 00:44:00;4-5 hours;Electromagnetic fields????!!!! We have several sets large windows in our bedroom And we are located around 1100 feet up on a Ridge.  During early hours of the night on 8/7 into 8/8 bright lights kept shining through the curtains into our bedroom.  At first I thought it was traffic going by but after it kept waking me up I stood up and open the curtains to see where it was coming from which is when I found out it was coming from my sons car outside in our driveway.  His car lights kept turning on and then off sometimes it only lasted a couple of seconds and sometimes quickly flashed on and off.  As I looked to the south west I could see behind the tree line moving blue red and white light.    My husband woke up to ask what that was all about and I told him and luckily the lights like a craft and then on the car lights again so I sent husband down to see if our son was doing something with his car but my husband went outside and looked around the house and found our son sleeping so he didn’t wan! t to wake him up to ask him.  This morning I ask my son if he was doing something with his car last night and he said no and I asked him if he was maybe rolling over on the key fab and he said no the key fabs battery was dead.  This flashing on and off of car lights happened several times during the night so I didn’t  sleep much there was nothing else I didn’t get up and keep checking outside like I wish I would’ve but my husband gets very irritated when I wake him up but I believe he was even spooked by this incident.  Altogether there were three  lighted moving objects spotted that were lit up in the sky no other which seemed very close ad very bright there were no other stars in the sky it was cloudy.  We’ve had several spotting out here before but nothing like this.;43.364;-90.4305
