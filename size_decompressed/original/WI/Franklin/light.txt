Two white lights one degree apart spotted over Milwaukee, Wisconsin from Franklin, Wisconsin moving in unison from the SW to the NE.;2009-02-08 17:30:00;1 minute;Two white lights one degree apart spotted over Milwaukee, Wisconsin from Franklin, Wisconsin moving in unison from the SW to the NE. Two white lights similar to a bright planet as bright as Venus (in the SW sky at the time) about one degree apart were observied in the NE sky about 20 degrees from the zenith. From our vantage point in Franklin, I assume the lights were directly over Milwaukee, Wisconsin. One light was leading the other as they slowly moved towards the NE and out over Lake Michigan.  Both UFO's remained an equal distance apart from one another and at a consistent speed.  Both UFO's began fading equally until they disappeared similar to a visible satellite when passing over a brightly lit city. No flashing or changing of color of the UFO's was noticed in the duration of the event. After the episode, I searched websites to verify that the UFO's were indeed visible satellites. No reported matches were found.;42.9016;-88.0095000000001

Flashing lights.;2013-12-15 21:45:00;entire night;Flashing lights I live in Franklin, WI.  I went to bed at around 9:45pm.  Before crawling into bed I noticed a flashing light to the south.  It was at about a 70 degree angle from the horizon.  It was higher that the clouds as a western moving formation obscured it within about 15 mins of viewing.  I called my children upstairs who also saw this light.  One of them then noticed another flashing light nearly straight up but slightly to the east.   I took several pictures with a high powered camera which showed the white light was actually a rose colored hue.  I know the difference between a light and the aircraft flying into Mitchell Field.   At 6:20 am I walked my daughter to the end of our street for the bus to pick her up.  I noticed to the north a flashing light again.  My daughter also saw this light.  It remained stationary until the sun obscured it.;42.9016;-88.0095000000001
Blue light that changed colors, directions, and disappeared;2014-12-05 19:40:00;3-4 minutes;Blue light that changed colors, directions, and disappeared We saw one light in the sky.  It started out a bright blue and was stopped midair.  Then the light turned off and it turned into a flashing green light as it moved sideways.   Then it turned into a bright blue light and moved back the other direction that it came from.  The light turned off again and turned into a smaller white flashing light.   Then it flew off quickly.;42.9016;-88.0095000000001
White flashing light seen over the I94 interstate. Caledonia/Racine WI;2016-10-24 01:00:00;2 hours;White flashing light seen over the I94 interstate. Caledonia/Racine WI Woke up at about 1:00 am and saw a bright light to the south of my home.  The light was as bright as an aircraft landing light however this light remained stationary in the sky and flashed rapidly (several times per second) shifting colors (white, red blue/green).  It appeared to be several miles away from my house and probably 1000-2000 feet above the ground.  The flashing lights remained in its location for 2+ hours.  From this position I would estimate the light to be directly above the I-94 interchange on the north end of Racine/Caledonia WI.;42.9016;-88.0095000000001
Bright multi colored light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star, we suspect, possibly Sirius.  PD));2016-11-20 09:30:00;30 minutes +;At around 10.30, I headed upstairs to bed (following a dismal packers game) and saw the same bright multi colored light in the air that I reported on 10-24-16.  Appears to be above I 94 near Racine/Caledonia, Wisconsin, border.  This light appears to be many times brighter than any other object (excluding the moon) in the sky.  This was not an aircraft since the light never moved from its original position.  Object continually shifts colors (red, blue, white) like a colidascope. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));42.9016;-88.0095000000001
