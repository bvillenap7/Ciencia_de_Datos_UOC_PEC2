Short bright blueish white hour glass shape light moving at high rate of speed upwards.;2014-04-03 20:00:00;30-45 seconds;Short bright blueish white hour glass shape light moving at high rate of speed upwards Driving home from grocery store my wife, myself and her little brother saw a strange bluish white light in the shape of an hour glass.  Didn't think much of it at first because it was in the direction of the airport, but then noticed a distinct hour glass shape (did not look like a plane).  Though maybe shooting star after that but only problem was it was moving up, not down, and at a very high rate of speed, faster than any plane ive seen and flight paths pass close to our house and never seen anything like this before.  Lasted about 30-45 seconds when we turned the corner to our house we lost sight behind trees by the time we were able to see the area it was in.   Again, there was no trace of it anywhere.;42.9016;-88.0095000000001
