Fireballs approaching like planes approaching an airfield.;2012-05-05 15:00:00;5-10 minutes;Fireballs approaching like planes approaching an airfield. My nephew and I were walking home, when I noticed three to four lights in the sky.  I thought they were normal at first because the way they were approaching our direction were very similar to how airplanes approach a runway, kinda lining up one after the other. We had lived not too far from the airport. Two things had struck me that kept me watching them.  They didn't have the blinking lights that airplanes have but looked like fireballs.  And the second thing was, they weren't coming in the direction to the airport that planes often do. Not to concerned, my nephew and I continued to walk, eventually losing sight of these objects behind the tree line.  A little after we lost sight, I happened to look up and seen what had to be one of those fireballs fly overhead.  Only it didn't appear to be a fireball anymore. I knew it was the same object as the fireball because it was on the same trajectory.  There was only one and as it flew over it didn't make a sound.;42.9016;-88.0095000000001
Fast moving ball of light was moving up and down.;2020-04-15 19:45:00;1 minute;Fast moving ball of light was moving up and down. I saw a big ball of orange light moving in the sky.  It looked like it was moving rapidly up and down.  My brother also noticed the light and we saw it was much different than the normal types of objects you would see in the sky.  This was no star, it wasnâ€™t the sun.  It also seemed to change to a greenish color after a few seconds.  My dog perked up when he saw it and began to back away from the window.  He did not come out of his crate until we fed him dinner.  Then, after about a minute, it disappeared into thin air.;42.9016;-88.0095000000001
