Bright rectangle shape over Franklin, WI.;2014-02-10 05:00:00;30 minutes;Bright retangle shape over Franklin ,WI I was on my way to work the bright white light was shaped like a rectangle.  It was South East and didn’t move during the fifteen minutes I arrived at work.  I had to go inside and couldn’t stay and see when it left.  There wasn’t any flashing lights just as bright as a star but shaped like a rectangle.;42.9016;-88.0095000000001
Large flat black rectangular shape just hanging in sky.;2020-10-31 12:00:00;30-60 seconds;Large flat black rectangular shape just hanging in sky. My husband and I were driving north on S 76th St  between W Forest Hill and W Rawson Ave and I noticed this large, flat, black rectangular object just hanging in the sky. It was pretty big.  It was not moving except for turning sideways or straight up and back again. There were no lights on it.  I said to my husband to look but he was driving and couldn’t see it. I kept watching it until some trees got in the way.  Once we passed the trees it was gone. There was no wind at the time either.  It happened so fast I didn’t get pictures. Weird!;42.9016;-88.0095000000001
