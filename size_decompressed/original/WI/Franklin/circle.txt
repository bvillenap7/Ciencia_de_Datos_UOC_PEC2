I spotted 5 orange lights dancing around the sky.  I reached home and ran into the house.  From my home out of my bedroom window my boyfriend and I witnessed one of the orange lights come very low over the field across the street.  It illuminated such a bright light it was almost painful to look at.   Suddenly the light dimmed and the object shot straight up into the sky.   It felt like it all happened within seconds but we realized a couple hours had passed.;42.9016;-88.0095000000001
