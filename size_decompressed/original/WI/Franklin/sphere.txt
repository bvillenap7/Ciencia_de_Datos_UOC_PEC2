I OBSERVED A VERY LARGE SPHERICAL BRIGHT LIGHT AS I WAS TRAVELING IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION APPROXIMATELY 76TH.  AND RAWSON, FRANKLIN WISCONSIN AT 5:30 AM ON THE 25TH. OF APRIL 2013, AS I OBSERVED THE LIGHT I QUICKLY DISMISSED A CONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT AS THE SPHERICAL LIGHT WAS TOO LARGE AND TO BRIGHT ALMOST AS IF IT WERE A SMALL MOON AND THAT NOTICEABLE AS WELL.I OBSERVED THE OBJECT 6 MINUTES OR SO AND IT APPEARED TO HAVE SLIPPED BEHIND THE CLOUDS AND LATTER THOUGHT, WAIT A MINUTE, THERE ARE NO CLOUDS, IT MUST HAVE SHOT STRAIGHT UP IN A BLINK AND DISAPPEARED.  I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN AN UNBELIEVER OF UFOS' TILL NOW.  I AM AN I.S EMPLOYEE AND I HAVE ALWAYS APPLIED LOGIC TO WHATEVER AND THIS GOES BEYOND, KIND;42.9016;-88.0095000000001
