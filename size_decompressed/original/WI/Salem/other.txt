We saw an orange circle shaped object that appeared somewhat large if compared to an airplane in the sky.  It was quite bright, or illuminated.   There was no flashing lights, or sound we could hear associated with it.   It came from the east, and then turned to the north and continued until out of sight.   We attempted to photograph with the camera, but due to a bouncing type movement in the camera, a cellphone picture was taken.;42.5703;-88.1341
