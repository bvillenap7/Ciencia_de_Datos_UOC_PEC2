I believe the objects to be within a mile or two of the highway I was traveling.  I pulled over and lowered my window.  The lights expanded in size then changed color turning from red to orange then dimmed to yellow before vanishing.  I waited a couple minutes then drove a mile to the first side road and traveled southward in hopes of getting another glimpse over open fields.  I stoped and got out of my vehicle looking southwest.  A few minutes later, one of the lights reappeared several miles away then vanished after 5 seconds.  Five minutes went by then both lights reappeared on the horizion.  After 10 seconds one light went out and the second light became bright, expanded in size then dimmed just as the first light reappeared.  Both lights blinked ON & OFF then vanished. No sound or vapor trail emitted.  These lights were very large in! size.  Had a 727 passenger plane been in the same air space I believe the objects would have dwarfed the planes.;44.1959;-88.692
