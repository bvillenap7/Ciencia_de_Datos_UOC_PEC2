Two synchronized objects that moved across the sky.;2012-06-22 23:15:00;30 seconds;Two synchronized objects that moved across the sky. After seeing a triangular shaped vehicle earlier in the night we decided to sit on the deck and see who could spot the most satellites moving across the sky. Within an hour we saw about sixteen satellites all moving in the normal north to south or south to north direction. We were a little amazed to see two objects (dim points of light) that looked to be satellites moving across the sky from northwest to southeast. They were moving together in what looked to be perfect synchronization.  Having seen the International Space Station earlier we knew that it couldnâ€™t be that. I have never seen two satellites move together like that. They appeared to be about an inch apart (as seen from our point of view).
