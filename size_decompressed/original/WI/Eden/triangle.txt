Fast moving high altitude triangle with three lights. No strobe or flashing beacon.;2012-06-22 21:56:00;20 seconds;Fast moving high altitude triangle with three lights. No strobe or flashing beacon. We were watching the International Space Station go over. About a minute after it passed over my friend was looking straight up and said “what’s that?”  Then she said “It’s a triangle!” I looked and saw what looked like three points of light in a small triangle and could vaguely make out the dark triangle shape of the craft. It was moving fast at a very high altitude and traveled west to east. I grabbed my binoculars from my truck and verified the three lights but it was too far away by then to see anything else.  There was no flashing strobe or beacon as is required by ordinary planes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.6971;-88.3215
