It was before I was going to go to work. I was out on my deck with my wife eating breakfast and I saw something in the sky. I saw a cigar shaped object moving slowly across the sky. It had bright lights, like windows along the side of it. Then in the next five minutes, three more craft appeared. They were in a V-shaped flight formation heading to the north.  My son came on the deck with me and my wife four minutes after the other three appeared. After a short time, maybe a couple minutes, the craft took off at very high speed to the north.  I never saw them again.;45.5096;-92.6189
