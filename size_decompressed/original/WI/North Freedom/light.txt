I'm not sure what we saw. We were star gazing around 11:30 at night when a very bright light from the west caught our attention at the same time.  The brightness was comparable to that of burning magnesium which seemed to create a glow our halo around it.  It was very high up.  The glow lasted for about 10 seconds as it moved slowly to the north.  The light dimmed and started to accelerate, moving in a straight line for another 10 seconds or so.  All of the sudden it seemed to turn on a dime (about a 45' angle) and started moving faster and getting dimmer (barley visable). This lasted about another 80 seconds when it grew very bright like it had previously and then it was gone. What this was we really had no idea.  Our first thought was that it was a satelite reflecting light from the sun. However that doesn't explain the sudden change in course.  It was much to far away to get any more details.  Very interesting.  If you've ever heard anything like this could you please let me know.;43.4106;-89.849
