Mid day cigar shape citing while deer hunting;1984-11-24 13:00:00;10 seconds;Mid day cigar shape citing while deer hunting A cylindrical craft approximately 25M long cruised over my head producing a high pitched drone, faint and not piercing.  The craft was black against a grey cloudy sky, and did not have wings or noticeable tail. It was not moving fast, but seemed to move about as fast as a goose landing. I estimate the altitude at 300-400 feet. I have 19 years military experience, 16 in the USAF. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD));43.3335;-89.0347
