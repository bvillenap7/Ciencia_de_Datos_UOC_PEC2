I have always been open to the idea of UFO’s and other phenomena, but I’ve never seen anything unexplainable prior to this evening.  I am a full-time advertising sales representative at the local newspaper, as well as a student at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.  I am not well informed on this issue, but I hope that I can describe what I saw well enough to be helpful. At approximately 11:45pm on Monday, December 29th, I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  The deck that is at the back of our home overlooks the woods on a portion of the Manitowoc River.  My view was partially obstructed by trees, but I clearly saw some distinct lights quite low to the ground. There were three white lights in a horizontal row, the middle light was the largest and brightest and most directly focused toward me.  The shape of the object was difficult to discern completely because of the brightness of the lights and the fact that the lights were reflecting off of some kind of slight smoke or haziness.  It appeared to be either a stunted oblong shape or a slightly rounded diamond shape.  It stayed practically stationary the whole time, but would occasionally sway horizontally to one side or the other.  I kept staring at it to try to figure out what it was, and then I saw three or four very small red lights zig-zaging around it.  I also thought I heard a sort of reverberating humming sound, but I’m near the highway so that could’ve been anything. I strongly regret that I did not take any photos.   I got scared and came inside.;44.0986;-87.6782
