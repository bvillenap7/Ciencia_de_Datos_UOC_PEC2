Three Bright Lights over Manitowoc;2009-09-13 19:00:00;5 minutes;Three Bright Lights over Manitowoc Three lights that were far enough apart as to indicate three separate objects.  They traveled from the SW sky heading NE.  They were relatively slow and made no apparent sound.   At first I tried to rule out flying objects because they appeared to be  ground generated from a larger laser light.  They were bright orangish-red.  A light fog was rolling in off of Lake Michigan and as they headed over the lake and got behind the fog I could still see them slightly through the fog which indicated to me that they weren't ground generated.  They flew in a straight line.;44.0986;-87.6782
UFO Bright light dissipated than vanished out of thin air;2013-08-23 20:50:00;5 minutes;UFO Bright light dissipated than vanished out of thin air I was outside taking the dogs out at my home, I looked up in the sky and seen this very very bright light.  I watched the bright light for a few minutes and it was dropping lower and speeding up and slowing down.  The light became pretty low and I watched it hovering in one spot for a minute or two.  Then it started to move slow and I seen the light slowly dissipating and than it vanished out of thin air, I even watched for an extra few minutes and no luck it never showed, there was no clouds in the sky either.  I cant explain what I saw tonight, I do not think planes would just vanish out of thin air . ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

It looked like a white light that apparently turned to reveal green-blue and red lights.   We observed these lights two streets from the lake.  It moved smoothly and silently, disappearing behind trees to the south.;44.0986;-87.6782
Basketball size ball flew in the sky in a U pattern the streaked in-between the two apartment buildings.;2014-11-22 22:40:00;~2 seconds;Basketball size ball flew in the sky in a U pattern the streaked in-between the two apartment buildings. Our apartment building is a few blocks from lake michigan and it is very dark in our neighbourhood. we were sitting and playing PS3 when I noticed a tiny ball of light fly from the street above our building, flew about a block then made a u-turn and then shot down and streaked in-between the two apartment buildings.   We are on the second floor and the orb appeared to my boyfriend and I as about a basketball in size and extremely bright as it flew past our windows.  He says it was medium blue with a white core, and I say it was lime green with a very bright centre. either way, the block only has one light about fifty feet away, and the area around the apartment buildings is VERY unlit, so this thing really lit up the common area in the two seconds it whizzed in a straight line towards lake Michigan at twenty feet above the ground lighting up the area around it, again it was very bright and colourful and it left a trail in our eyes  that lasted for a few seconds, kind of like seeing a bright flashlight in a black room. This was not a meteorite or anything as I saw it fly to an altitude of maybe 150 feet before it dived and went by the window. shooting stars dont change course nor do they fly straight and level (at 20 feet) above the ground.   We both work a lot and were not drinking at the time, we were just playing sky rim when we saw it.;44.0986;-87.6782
3 white and red lights.;2015-07-04 00:30:00;45 minutes;3 white and red lights We were sitting in back yard when a white light with red in the middle came out of the south west, heading north east.  The light was very high in the sky  , it took about 1 min. To pass over.    After 15 min. Another passed then 15 min.  Another passed over , the same direction .  There was no sound.  I asked my I phone if there were planes above us and it said there were none.   It was very strange!!;44.0986;-87.6782
