Red Orbs Near Lake Michigan.;2014-08-17 21:00:00;15 minutes;Red Orbs Near Lake Michigan At about 9pm on Sunday, August 17, 2014, while I was taking my puppy out to eliminate, I was struck by what I saw up in the sky.   I initially saw about four to six red fireball shaped objects drifting together in a uniform pace and line.   At first I thought they must be shooting stars, but on closer observation, it was clear that they were not that.  They did not seem very high up in the sky and were right above our neighborhood flying in an arc pattern.   I called my husband to come out and he too saw them and confirmed that they were not shooting stars or airplanes.  They were very quiet and appeared to shimmer and hover.    Several minutes later we saw two more slowly drifting along together.  It seemed that they all flew slowly in pairs.   We live one mile west of Lake Michigan and they were flying toward the southwest.;44.0986;-87.6782
