Pair of lights over Lake Michigan;2003-11-25 20:30:00;3-5 minutes;Pair of lights over Lake Michigan I noticed a pair of lights, orange and blue, over Lake Michigan to the east and southeast dimming and brightening alternately.  The lights were in a straight line and seemed to remain stationary for about 4 minutes or so.  I heard no noise and the lights continued to remain in place.  The formation gradually moved very slowly due north, again silent.  The lights continued to dim and brighten alternately.  When the formation moved due east of my position, the lights disappeared and did not reappear.;44.0986;-87.6782
