It was about 3:00 in the afternoon and i was sitting on my back porch tanning.  I looked up and saw two round objects moving across the sky.  They were both perfectly round and one was followed by the other.  They were going about the same speed as a jet. All of a sudden they moved opposite of each other very fast and crossed moving towards the ground as if they were crashing.  They went bellow the tree line and I couldnt find them again. They were both complete circles and had a orangish+red hue. Also all the lights in my house flickered and i couldnt here any animals or bugs. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
