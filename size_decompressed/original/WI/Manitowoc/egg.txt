My wife and I were turning down the street, and I was sitting in the passanger seat. We started to turn into our driveway when I noticed, to my left, a white egg shaped light streaking in a downward motion towards the ground and then dissapeared. It left a trail of  blue-aqua colored streak of light behind it when it was moving downward. it seemed to be about 2000 feet in the air. i decided to report this because I cannot explain what this was. i stayed outside for a short time later but was unable to see it again;44.0986;-87.6782
