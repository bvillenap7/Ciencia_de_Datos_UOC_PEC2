Orb of light with unexplainable movement.;2014-02-10 23:00:00;30 seconds;Orb of light with unexplainable movement. I picked my ex girlfriend up from work.  We were heading west about 2 miles beyond the city limits, when I noticed an orb in the sky.  It was an orb that had a white-ish light.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend, and she couldn't see it at first, then after 10 seconds she noticed it too.  She asked what is that?   As I was discerning what it could be, I replied I think a helicopter.  However this object would move at a great rate of speed, then stop on a dime, then it would ascend upwards, stop, then descend. Upon seeing these motions I blurted out, That's no helicopter!.  I was still trying to discern what this object could be, as I've never seen anything move like that before, and said, I don't know what that could be!   After about 30 seconds the orb disappeared, however for about 10 seconds, my girlfriend said she could still see it in the sky in front of us.  I added the timing in which both of us initially seen it, and when it disappeared for both us because it seemed as if we were veiwing it on different timelines. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.467;-88.355
