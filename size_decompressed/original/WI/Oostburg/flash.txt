bright multi-colored blinking object south east of Sheboygan Wisconsin;2000-11-20 23:00:00;1/2 hour;bright multi-colored blinking object south east of Sheboygan Wisconsin In the east/southeast sky a bright object hovered for a long period of time. The night was very clear and I first thought it was a very bright star, but it appeared to be blinking red, green and blue lights. Since it was blinking, I then thought it may be some type of aircraft, but it was not moving at all. I used a pair of binoculars to get a better look, but it was so far out over Lake Michigan that it only made the lights more defined. I was just curious if there were any other reports of it, or some explaination. ((NUFORC Note:  Report seems reminiscent of twinkling star, or planet.  PD));43.6261;-87.7925999999999
