Moving horizontally then vertically, red/yellow orb, noiseless, able to go vertical at a quick speed and change positions quickly;2011-07-04 22:00:00;5 min. max;moving horizontally then vertically, red/yellow orb, noiseless, able to go vertical at a quick speed and change positions quickly No time to think about switching settings on the camera to video it was set for twilight.  I thought the pics were pretty good since it was black out and the thing was high.  There were no running lights â€“ just one big light that I thought was red and my husband thought was yellow so maybe it was changing. No noise either. When I enlarge the 2nd pic on my camera it looks like there might have been 2 orbs???  The tail on the second pic (above and below) I think was from my moving the camera but not sure. It was traveling horizontally and then shot up dissappearing for a short time and then reappearing in one location and then quickly in another and then dissappeard again and then I saw it in space (up very high) traveling horizontally at an extrememly rapid speed - faster than any airplane would go and then dissappeared totally. It was difficult to check the characteristics below as I'm not sure on some of it.  The trail in the picture could be from my movement, it was pretty high in order for me to really determine if there was a haze or aura, there appeared to be some beams in one picture at the lower left corner and as mentioned above I thought it was red and my husband thought it was yellow, so it might have been changing color. Pictures were taken with a Sony camera set at twilight at 10:00 (approx.) at night. The object was moving South to North before going up, zipping around and then up again (star high) and moving horizontally at a very very fast speed. So glad I wasn't alone to see it.
