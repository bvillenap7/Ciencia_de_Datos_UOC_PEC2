I called over my CB radio to see if any other truck drivers were seeing this as well.  To my surprise one got back to me saying he was watching it too for about 30 seconds.   It was overcast skies so I don't feel any airplanes would be flying that low with that weird set of lights.;42.8373999999999;-89.0680000000001
