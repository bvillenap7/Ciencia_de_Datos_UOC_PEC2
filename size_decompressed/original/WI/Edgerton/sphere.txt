5-6 Orange Orbs over Rock River in Edgerton, WI;2011-07-03 00:30:00;1.5 minutes;5-6 Orange Orbs over Rock River in Edgerton, WI My husband and I, both college educated professionals, saw 5-6 orange orbs in the sky over the Rock River on July 3rd.  The spheres appeared different sizes or distances away.  They glowed somewhat and moved very slowly, almost hovering.   We watched them for about a minute and a half.  They slowly got further away then individually turned red and dissipated.  There was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Flying bright orbs that flew around in a tight area like firefilies;2016-08-07 21:30:00;30 minutes;Flying bright orbs that flew around in a tight area like firefilies So when the Packer game got canceled last night, I decided to take a drive around the back roads with my friend.  Took a little 2 hour drive and on the way home, Utica was having their Utica Fest, and we drove through it.  We drove down 106 and got onto Hillside Road, and my friend said he saw the firework show from Utica going on in the distance.   So I decided to take Aarback Road to Highway 73.  I parked the car 30 feet away from the intersection of Arback Road and Hwy 73.  My friend and I got out of the walked up to the intersection.  So we were looking North West towards Utica and it's 4 miles away from our location.  It is not that impressive watching a fireworks show from that faraway.  So we were watching the show and towards the finally a very bright meteor streaked over our heads from the Eastern sky to the South Western sky.   Then about 2-3 minutes later in the same South Western part of the sky- in the same area or direction of where the meteorite traveled to! - just above the horizon what looked like it was over 40 miles away from us- there were these weird lights that what looked like welding sparks falling very slowly from the sky.  I told my friends it's probably just pieces of the meteorite falling to Earth.  Well here is where it gets weird!  Those sparks just stop in midair and then they started to move back upwards again and then start to zip around in tight circles like fireflies.   After a few minutes of doing that, they came together to make one very bright orb in the sky.   After about 20 seconds, they separated and dance around again, still at the same height, not lowering or rising in the shy just above the horizon.   I told my friend to get out his phone to capture this.   Three minutes goes by and they came together yet again to form the bright orb, but only this time it wasn't as bright as the first time they did it.  It was visible for maybe 15-20 seconds and then it broke up again.   The sparks then looked like they were forming an elongated tube but eventually they turned back into the in! dividual sparks and then vanished from the sky.  My friend got the orb thing on his phone, but it's not very clear video.   I wish I had my camera, because I could have used the telephoto lens on my camera. I started to rationalize that maybe it was a squadron of F-16's with their engines making the spark-like lights and they we were just maneuvering around and maybe the bright orb that we saw was one of the F-16's was using it's afterburner.   I really do not know what it was, but it was very cool!;42.8373999999999;-89.0680000000001
