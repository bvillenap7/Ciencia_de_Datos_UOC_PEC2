Triangular - 3 lights one red and two white. Night of 2/23/05 in Edgerton, Wisconsin on Hwy I-90 around 7 p.m.;2005-02-23 19:00:00;10 minutes;Triangular - 3 lights one red and two white. Night of 2/23/05 in Edgerton, Wisconsin on Hwy I-90 around 7 p.m. I saw two triangle shaped objects on the opposite sides of Interstate 90 heading North by the Edgerton/Newville exit.  The object on the right hand side of my car was very far off in the distance so I could not see it very well.  The object on the left side (driver's side) of my car was hovering at an altitude similiar to the height of a electrical tower although there are no towers in that vicinity.  There were 3 lights one red and two white and it was triangular in shape.  I watched it sit there blinking and it did not make a sound or move.  This is not the first time I've seen these objects in this area.  They seem to appear quite often and have been on my drive North on this Interstate in this same area for the last couple of months.  I do not see them every week or every day but I do see them frequently and my children have seen them as well.  It is always around the same time of evening when I see them.  There have been times I've seen them move and then stop again.  On the night of the 23rd, there were moments when it would disappear and then reappear.  I was trying to be very careful as I was driving and wanted to keep my eyes on the road.  These are not planes and they are not stars.  One time a couple of months ago, I followed one and when I stopped my car to look at it, it took off.
