Twin vertical, bluish light that pulsed to red then glowed to yellow.;2013-10-26 19:55:00;5 minutes;Twin verticle, bluish light that pulsed to red then glowed to yellow. I observed one object that appeared to be a bright light approximately 30 degrees from the horizon line and west, southwest of our country home.   I took pictures of the object and also filmed it for one minute.  After loading it into the computer, and enlarging the image, it appeared to be a dual, vertically aligned, cigar shaped, bluish light that pulsed to a red flash on the north side only.   After the red flash, the object appeared to glow with an orange/yellow glow with a halo effect.  Also, with high magnification, there was a very faint outline of a rectangle or square although the outline was very faint.   This is the third time I've seen this object in the same general area and the second time I've filmed it.   I observed and filmed it for five minutes although the object appeared in the sky for approximately fifteen minutes, then disappeared altogether.;42.8373999999999;-89.0680000000001
