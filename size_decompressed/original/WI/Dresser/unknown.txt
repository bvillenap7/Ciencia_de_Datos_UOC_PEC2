At least 10 amber circular silent lights moving in the sky in rural area of Dresser, WI;2013-06-15 22:30:00;25 minutes;At least 10 amber circular silent lights moving in the sky in rural area of Dresser, WI We saw at least 10 amber circular lights moving across the sky west to east.  They were under 2000 feet in the air they moved in a straight line and had an equal distance between them.  There was no sound and they moved steadily in uniform.  When they got to a certain point in the eastern sky they would disappear.  It appeared that they were moving in a circular motion as they were going around in the sky.  It lasted at least 20 minutes.  They didn't appear to be flares, chinese candle lights, or aircraft lights.  At the end we saw a bright white light trailer behind the amber lights and was moving very quickly.  The lights disappeared and we didn't see them again after we saw the white light following the amber lights.  The most bizarre thing we have ever seen.;45.3554000000001;-92.5591999999998
