Large Orange Sphere over Polk county Wisconsin.;2013-10-11 22:08:00;1 minutes;Large Orange Sphere over Polk county Wisconsin. I was driving home, north on state highway 35 about 2 miles from county road X, heading to my house in Dresser, when I noticed a very large orange sphere moving across the sky from far west to about 40 miles east.  I have lived around airplanes my whole life and the sphere was over ten times the size of any aircraft I've ever seen.  It was a constant bright orange light moving about 2000 + miles a hour.   Our elevation is about 800 to 900 ft above sea level and the sphere was about 10000 ft above the ground.   I watched it move across the sky for about 1 minute then it just disappeared.  It was very bright, with no blinking or any other colors.  There were stars and airplanes in sight and it clearly was not either.;45.3554000000001;-92.5591999999998
