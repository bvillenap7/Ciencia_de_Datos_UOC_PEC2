My sister and i were driving to the mall when going on to Highway 41 i noticed something oval in the sky.... it looked like a fire ball in the sky. But as we both looked at it closer we could see an oval shape on the top of it and sometimes we could see an oval shape on the bottom of it also.  There was a black dot in the front of the fireball.  It was below the clouds. travelling up towards the right. as we were going south on highway 41 between N and Wisconsin Ave.  I'm not sure what it was and it would make my sister feel better if she found out what it was.;44.2765;-88.3134
