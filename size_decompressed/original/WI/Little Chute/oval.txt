Distinct orange oval globes seen twice south of Little Chute, WI on 2 different dates and times in Jan 2016.;2016-01-19 06:25:00;1 minute;Distinct orange oval globes seen twice south of Little Chute, WI, on 2 different dates and times in January 2016. Tuesday, 19, 2016, at about 6:25, south-side of Little Chute, on the north-side of the Kimberly/Little Chute Bridge an orange oval globe appeared.  The globe was not emitting light as a street light does.  It had a defined oval shape and larger than the streetlights about 2 blocks away.  No noise, stealthy at our location. It was traveled east at a rate about 5 times faster rate than an airplane for about 15 seconds.  It stopped and hovered for about 4 seconds.  Then it moved back west the exact same path but only Â¼ the way for about 3 seconds. It stopped and hovered for about 5 seconds and slowly descended at a much slower rate than when it was traveling east and west.  It was descending because the size of the oval globe did not change size. I lost sight of it when it went below the tree line on the other side of the bridge. A few weeks prior on a Thursday evening around 20:30, at the same location, 2 of us saw the same orange oval globe, but 3 appeared in a distinct formation.  They appeared at the same location, traveled the same path going east and at the same rate of speed.  The globes did not stop, just continued east until they were out of our sight. We were trying to figure out the size and altitude comparing it to an airplane.  We sighted a plane going west but higher than the oval orange gloves did.  The globes were definitely moving at least 5 times faster than the plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.2765;-88.3134
