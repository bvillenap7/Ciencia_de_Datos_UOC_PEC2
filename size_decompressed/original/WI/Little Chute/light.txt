The Light disappeared after it went past the big dipper.  The light was moving at a high rate of speed.  It vanished after about 40 seconds.  The Light seemed to be leaving the Earths Atmosphere. It looked very similar to a star that moves in my best description.  This did  not look like a satellite.;44.2765;-88.3134
