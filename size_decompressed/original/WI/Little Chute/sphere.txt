Metallic sphere hovering over Hwy 41 Southbound Lane, just outside of Little Chute Wisconsin.;2013-11-30 16:40:00;1 minute;Metallic sphere hovering over Hwy 41 Southbound Lane, just outside of Little Chute Wisconsin. My wife and i were traveling southbound on Hwy 41 returning to our home in Oshkosh from Green Bay.  It was late afternoon on November 30th 2013.  About one mile outside of Little Chute we noticed a dark circle ahead in the distance over the highway's left lane.  We watched it as we got closer we realized it was completely motionless.  There was a car slightly in front of me on in the left lane that I was sure was going to hit it.  As we approached it the object appeared very metallic in the headlights of the car.  It hovered over the highway at about 8 feet, and was approximately the size of a basketball, or slightly larger.   As the car in front of me passed directly underneath it, the object did not move at all.  It hovered completely motionless even when the car passed under it.  This happened around 4:40 P.M. and as soon as i got home i reported it to Fox 11 news as well as some other stations.   This was by far the strangest thing I have ever seen in my 33 years on the planet.  Whatever this was, it was silent, motionless, metallic, and unaffected by air movement.;44.2765;-88.3134
