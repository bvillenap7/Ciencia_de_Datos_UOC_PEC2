Then these white dots started appearing dim then grew brighter in a triangle. I got my phone, started shooting video, but it only took a picture.  The next 5 minutes was nothing less than phenomenal with nothing being short of spectacular with the naked eye while what I thought I was capturing taking a video of it all. The triangle pinpoints were then connected by beams at the same time in synchrocy. Then another bar shaped light from the lower left side to the center grew brighter and brighter dividing itself in sections on both sides from the middle as if imaging the fields below facing in a southern direction for a few minutes.;44.4565;-92.1361
