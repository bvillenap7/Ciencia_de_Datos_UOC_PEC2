spinning craft with green aura circling above.;2002-08-02 23:30:00;30 min.;spinning craft with green aura circling above. My son who is 10 claims to have seen a saucer shaped object circling above. He said it had a green aura and the craft spun inside this aura. He said the green light would get real bright then be gone and start all over again. Also the craft had bright white lights around it's perimeter. I'm not sure what to think, most would say active imagination, but he is pretty freaked out about it. He has a classmate that described the same thing to him, so I don't know what to think. Just wondering if anyone else has seen something like this, or if I should just sum it up to imagination.
