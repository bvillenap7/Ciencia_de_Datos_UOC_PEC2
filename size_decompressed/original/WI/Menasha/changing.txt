Over the theater came a very bright white light, it then turned orangish red. 2 more bright white oddly shaped lights appeared to the left of the first one. a couple minutes later 2 more white lights appeared- this whole time I was taking pictures of the lights with my I phone. The lights almost appeared in the shape of a Nike swoosh.  I have never seen anything like this before. all the lights started flying towards Neenah- although they seemed very close at first , there was no noise associated with the lights.  A couple of other girls that came into work about ten minutes after me saw them too.;44.2095;-88.4162
