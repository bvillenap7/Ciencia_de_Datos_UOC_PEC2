Red and White lights form in a circle near North end of Lake Winnebago;2011-06-04 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;Red and White lights form in a circle near North end of Lake Winnebago While standing outside my apartment at approximately 9:30pm CST.  Two of my friends and I set our gaze to the Southeast horizon.  We saw approximately 15-20 lights that pulsed back and forth from red to white light rising over the horizon and ultimately forming an oval formation (like a circle from the side view) above the tree line. These objects rose gradually in a graceful manner accomplishing the formation and then breaking formation descended below the horizon.  A few of them seemed to disappear before lowering below the horizon. I am a USAF Veteran who worked on KC-135R's.  I've also worked for Delta airlines. We all live in the Fox Valley area so we are all well aware of the odd aircrafts that come around during EAA in Oshkosh. EAA doesnâ€™t come until late July. I've been to many Air Shows and have even helped host a military Air Show.  I do know that there was an Air Show in Manitowoc (per the local Fox affiliate) which is approximately 40 miles away in the wrong direction.  And these craft were not forming up in any way I've ever seen and did not move like any aircraft I have seen. We did go down to the beach on lake Winnebago to see if we could see if anything was happening there and there was nothing going on that we could see. I have never seen anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be exceptionally eloquent, knowledable, and serious-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.
