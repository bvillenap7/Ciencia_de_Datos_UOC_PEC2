Polymorphic drone-like craft.;2014-12-20 20:40:00;4-5 minutes;polymorphic drone-like craft Looked like a helicopter, but made no noise.  Hovered above neighboring houses and rotated Twice.  Its shape reminded me of polygon, that geometric Pok√©mon.  Was mostly gray and Black, four solid white lights were placed at the corners of craft.  I followed briefly With my car and took some video.  Unfortunately ducked into trees the second I started Filming.  Was headed from Appleton road towards 5th Street.  Hopefully I'm not the only one Who saw this last night.;44.2095;-88.4162
