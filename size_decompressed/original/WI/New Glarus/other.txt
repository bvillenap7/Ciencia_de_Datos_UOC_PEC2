Orbs and rod craft observed.;2014-04-20 01:15:00;5 seconds;Orbs and rod craft observed While observing an orange, waning gibeous moon, I saw what I originally thought was a meteor.  I immediately noticed it was composed of two spheres both spheres were slightly luminous, either on their own or due to reflectivity from the Moon, as the coloration was the same. I saw the objects travel due east, above a thin, high cloud cover.  There seemed to be a rod between.  Speed was perhaps five times that of a jetliner at cruise.  No sound was heard.  No course deviation was observed.  Line of sight was broken by buildings.;42.8128;-89.6418
