Saw a very bright light in the north eastern sky.;2001-01-02 17:05:00;2-min;Saw a very bright light in the north eastern sky. My son and I were returning home from shopping at Black River Falls.  We entered our driveway and driven to the top and stopped near the house.  My son looked out the windsheild and asked me- (Dad what is that!).  We both saw a White light that was very bright and brighter than any star.  It made a zig zap pattern across the sky.  It stopped once and started up again.  It seemed to know that we were watching it.  Very strange.  We watched it for about two min. and it dissappeared.  Clearly this was not a star or a aircraft.  Then my son told me that one time just a few months earlier that the members of my family watched a strange light in the sky.  It was night time and I work the night shift so I was not at home. My son said the light that he saw then was like the one we saw tonight.  That light moved very slowly and that it just dissapeared.;44.435;-90.8153
