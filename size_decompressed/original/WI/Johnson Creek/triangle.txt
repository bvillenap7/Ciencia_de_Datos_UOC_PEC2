Was initially thought to be a helicopter from afar, crossing the freeway from north to south before stopping in midair at an altitude of about 150 feet.  From afar it had blinking green and red lights with a bright white light in the center similar to a Cessna 172 or news helicopter.   As we drove under it, I realized that it was hovering and it was not a helicopter. The craft was triangular and either completely transparent or black like the night sky with red and green blinking lights on the corners and a large white light in the center like an engine of some sort.  It was about the size of a small plane and was spinning slowly as it hovered. Unless this was a very advanced stealth military drone i can not explain what it is that i saw.  I am a 16 year birder having seen over 300 species in my lifetime.  I am also familiar with all current U.S military aircraft and i have seen stealth bombers and fighters before, and this was different.  It was remarkable similar to the UFO that was shown in the last episode of the remake of the x-files. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
