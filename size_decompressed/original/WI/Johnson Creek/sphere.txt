It moved from north to south at a rapid pace, then disappeared. My wife and I were traveling east on I-94 towards Milwaukee, at around 4:15PM on Sunday, Sept. 27, 1998.  I saw a bright, white, spherical object moving across the clouds (it was bright enough to contrast the cloud) heading from north to south, bisecting the Interstate. It was moving fairly rapidly from my perspective, then it either vanished, or disappeared in to the cloud.  Seconds after it disappered, a darker object appeared at the same level, in the same cloud, but heading in the opposite direction at a slower rate of speed.  After watching the dark object for a while, it appeared to be an airplane, but I had not seen an airplane approaching before the white sphere disappeared.;43.0747;-88.7891
