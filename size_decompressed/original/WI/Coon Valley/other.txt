29 traveling lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-10-24 06:00:00;5 minutes;29 traveling lights On 10/24/2019 I went out to my deer hunting stand.  I got to the stand and laid down in it flat on my back to wait for the sun to come up.  It was very close to 6:00 a.m. Central Time.  It was a very clear night  sky (technically early morning) with only a sliver of moon and I was just enjoying the stars when I saw what looked like a star traveling across the sky but rather quickly, about a ¼ the speed of a shooting star.  It went in a NNE direction.  As I was trying to figure out what would travel at such a speed I spotted another one on the same trajectory and then another and another, usually spaced a similar distance but not always.  Some were rather close together but always on the same path and speed.   All told I counted 29 of them and the very last one was slightly off the path of the others.  I cannot reason what could travel that speed so far in the sky.  The lights did not blink and they did not fade while traveling until they just got to far off ! in the distance.  Like I said, they looked exactly like the stars around them and  there was 29 of them.  It was very quiet, no wind and yet there was no noise.  I prefer to be contacted via email or text initially as i do not answer phone calls whose number I don't recognize.  Sincerely  rb;43.7218;-91.0143
