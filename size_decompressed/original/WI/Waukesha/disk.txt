She came out a few minutes later and then we went on our way a minute late i spotted tho lights in the sky,on our right. Just a note we live in a normal small city,normal housing, plenty of people,but not a big city with skyscrapers.There were two light in a straight line there appeared to be on the same craft. The object was moving at a fast pace, there were airplanes in the sky around that same time and compared to this object they were going very slow. As we were still driving home which is a ten minute drive, we saw the object again but it added three more lights and they were traveling together in a slightly curved shape. Me and my mother were scared and we were close to home. The rest of the way we just kept looking forward and as soon as we reached our house we dashes to the door.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
Half-moon disc with orange light;2011-10-09 18:15:00;<1 minute;Half-moon disc with orange light My mother and I observed a shiny silver craft only a few hundred feet up moving westward at a good clip above our house.  The craft was flat and shaped like a half-moon and had a pulsing orange light underneath it.  It moved silently from East to West.  I tried to photograph the craft but could not get a clear photo.   The weather conditions were clear and sunny with no clouds visible.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
Hovering object, then took off fast.;2013-01-09 07:30:00;2 minutes;Hovering object, then took off fast On way to work, saw hovering saucer shaped object, 2 other objects that looked like planes with smoke coming from rear were near area.  One of the planes got near it, then the object sped off at a very fast rate.  I could see the object get smaller for about 20-30 seconds then it just disappeared.  No way a plane, helicopter, etc could have hovered that low in one spot, then take off that fast.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
