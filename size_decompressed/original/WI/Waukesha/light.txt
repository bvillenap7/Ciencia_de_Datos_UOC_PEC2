Dancing, circulating lights observed in Waukesha neighborhood.;2007-10-26 20:15:00;20-30 seconds;((ADDENDUM TO REPORT BELOW, SUBMITTED 09NO07)) I earlier filed a report regarding an Oct 26 sighting in Waukesha. This sighting has been invalidated as I now know the source of the lights and they can be explained away as being manmade.  Sorry about the first report.  AT the time I was completely convinced but with new information I can now say that I was fooled.  This taught me a lesson and should serve as a lesson to us all. ((END ADDENDUM)) Dancing, circulating lights observed in Waukesha neighborhood. When: Friday, October 26  Time: 8:15 p.m. Where: Waukesha, Wisconsin  What: I am a teacher and I had just arrived home from work and was walking around my car in the driveway when I looked to the Eastern sky and saw four lights in the low-lying cloud cover directly above our suburban neighborhoods. They appeared hundreds of feet in the sky, not thousands.  Three of the lights began to spin around in circles, at one point coming together in the middle of the point they were circulating, but for a moment, and then moving out apart again where they continued to rotate. The three circulating lights appeared to chase each other independently in an almost triangular configuration around a central light as they were nearly an equal distant apart from each other during most of this spinning “dance” in the clouds. Never in my 40 years have I seen anything like this. The lights appeared to emanate from the clouds, but I noticed no objects other than the strange lights. I was about to grab my camera from the house when I watched the lights dart off to a point in the southeast part of the sky, pause for a few seconds, and then blink out as simply as if one were turning off a light switch. Before blinking out, the lights appeared to be nothing more than a crack of light in the clouds. I’m willing to believe that this was somehow manmade, but I am at a loss for how it was accomplished. This was no ordinary lightshow. Unfortunately, although this is an urban neighborhood, I didn’t see anyone else outside at the time to confirm what I saw. Considering the urban nature of where this took place, I’m betting others might have seen this but I’ve read nothing in the local press.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
Far away dot of light intercepted a satellite. 3:35am waukesha sky.;2020-05-09 03:36:00;breif;Far away dot of light intercepted a satellite. 3:35am waukesha sky. walk out side to look at moon. Near it,, satellites were passing by. One dot of light started to move after a brief flash, and intercepted one of the satellites traveling west before continuing east. 30 or so more potential satellites proceeded to pass over my portion of sky coming from the west traveling east, and a few south to north.  With how many traveling in the same path, it resembled a convoy or patrol.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
30+ objects moving across the night sky. I've never seen anything like it before.  ((Staarlink satellites??));2021-05-22 22:00:00;2 minutes;30+ objects moving across the night sky. I've never seen anything like it before. Between 10 - 10:30 pm I observed 30+ objects flying across the sky in single file formation. They were uniformly spaced. They were too high to photograph & just looked like white lights. They were flying Northeast. I called my son's girlfriend out and she observed the last maybe 10 or so of them as they flew out of range.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
