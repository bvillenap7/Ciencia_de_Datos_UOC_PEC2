A dot of light moving very quickly and quietly;2002-07-06 02:00:00;1-5seconds;A dot of light moving very quickly and quietly There was this dot of light in front of us it was kinda creepy, but it was far away. It was a dot you might not think anything of it, but the dot was veeeeeeerrrrrrrryyyyyyy unusual. For one thing there was no sound, it was crystal clear out, and there was nothing else flying around that we could see of, and it just faded out of site. IT was kinda creepy and a very cool experience. We have some of it on tape. Hope to get an e-mail from u soon!!;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
Red/Yellow blinking/flickering light with unpredictable flight path;2010-08-08 17:55:00;30Seconds;Red/Yellow blinking/flickering light with unpredictable flight path On Sunday, Aug. 8th I observed what appeared to be the red blinking light of a radio/cell tower at just before 10pm.   From the West end of Madison, where it intersects with DT, the light was slightly north west, appearing just above the tree line.  I have observed that there is a cell tower in that vicinity, however the light that I saw appeared to be acting more similarly to the light of a lighthouse than the on/off blink of these towers.  The light changed from a large red to a smaller, dimmer yellowish amber - similar to that of stars.  And then it appeared to fly off.   At first I suspected a helicopter, however I could hear no sound and the rate of travel was inconsistent with my expectations, thus this posting. I have noticed something similar this evening, appearing this time in the south west sky and appearing to be much further away than what I observed last night.   Again, the red/yellow 'blinking' and unexpected movement. Perhaps this is merely light from stars that flew around like firecrackers at the end of their lives thousands of years ago and the light is just reaching us now.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
25 orange lights in the sky;2012-10-12 20:00:00;15 minutes;25 orange lights in the sky I first counted 17 orange circle lights in the sky.  One by one they dimmed and went away.   Then 6 came back and did the same thing.   The last thing I saw appeared to be a larger yellow orb which split into two and eventually those dimmed, too.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281

What I seen was a larger silver light, like something completley silver with full sun reflection off of it, moving at a slower pace, then it moved from what seemed a very slow rate of speed to what seemed like hyper-speed within a second and boom.  It was gone.  Like a meteor passing through the sky.  But it was larger in size.  Too big to have moved from a slow rate of speed to being so fast it disappeared in just a moment.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
