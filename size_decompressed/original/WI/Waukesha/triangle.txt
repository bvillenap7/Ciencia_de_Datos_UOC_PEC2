About 9 lights in a triangle shape evenly spaced.  Appeared to be one craft. Hovered about 200 yards off the ground, hovered over local farm field above Hwy 164 and skyline Ave for approximately 3 minutes with extremely quiet jet engine sound.  No rotor thump of that of a helicopter.  I drove under it and it slowly flew away at about 30 mph, with no engine increase in sound.  Clear night sky but I could not get a clear visual of the craft.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281

My wife and I were outside on the porch, we both saw the EXACT SAME THING.  There were 2 separate triangular formed objects.  They had absolutely no noise.  Each point had an bright dull yellow coloring.   They initially were separated by a very small amount, and then near the end of the event they the bottom right and bottom left corners of each object had overlapped. I am not much of a believer in UFOs...but I have absolutely no explanation for what I saw.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
