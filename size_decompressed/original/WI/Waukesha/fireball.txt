Just after dark me and two friends, one with a camcorder, were outside on a hill filming for a video we were making.  The camcorder was on, but not recording,(it was on locked mode)and I turned around to look out over the hill, and there was a bright, but small light out at about 45 degrees up from the ground at the horizon, there was no type of sound that I remember hearing.  I looked back around and yelled to my friend, Is the camera on?  Are you filming this? Both of my friends were already looking at it and the one with the camera replied, I just hit the record button.  That model of camcorder has a mechanism that automaticaly rewinds a few seconds and then starts to record.  When the object slowly faded to nothing, and then I shouted Did you get that?  What was that?!  He said, I think I got it, I'm not sure.  Afterwards we stayed on the hill for around another hour just to make sure that it wasn't a plane that would pass over us, and there was nothing.  There were no clouds that night, and we didn't know how to explain it's eerie disappearance.  We decided to keep all of the facts to ourselves after no one believed us, and now we are reporting to you in hopes of finding any information we can about what we saw.  We do have a few seconds of footage when the camera finally recorded, but, unfortunately, it only shows the object fading away. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Green object with light shot from tree top level into the sky.;2016-01-28 20:15:00;5 seconds;green object with light shot from tree top level into the sky. I was driving south on hwy 74 at I-94 and saw at treetop level to the southeast (11:00 oclock from due south) a neon green light that shot straightup into the air.   I thought it might be a firework.   It had an oval top shape with a kind of trail tail.  But it just disappeared into the sky.   Really weird--no idea what it was.
