Very bright white, round object  repeatedly expanding and minimizing to nothing in the clear blue sky.;2005-02-12 12:10:00;aprox. 1 min.;Very bright white, round object  repeatedly expanding and minimizing to nothing in the clear blue sky. Traveling on Highway 16 just before it turns into I-94 West I noticed a small round object whiter than any white I had ever seen and asked my friend if he can also see it. As he was confirming with a question of his own it appeared to slowly and steadily expand, becoming larger and then reversing the expansion at the same speed to nothing.This process went on for about a minute and then did not reappear. This was the only movements noticed by us both. The sky was clear, the sun was bright, and I appologize to the other motorist for slowing to 35 and swerving.;42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
