8/00/1972  or 8/1973 Waukesha, WI for 20 minutes, a sun-like oval object cited April 25, 2014;1972-08-28 01:15:00;15 minutes;8/00/1972  or 8/1973 Waukesha, WI for 20 minutes, a sun-like oval object cited April 25, 2014 In the summer of 1972 or 1973, I was dating my ex-husband in Waukesha, Wis.  We were kissing goodbye on the back porch, and we both saw an oval sun looking object on west horizon at 1:15 a.m.  Due to the rolling hills in Wisconsin, you can only see 5 miles in the distance, at the most.  My father was a volunteer fireman, so if there were any fires in a 10 mile radius from our farm my father would have been notified.  I observed there were solar flexes coming from this object and they split from the middle and went to the outside edges of this oval object and it disappeared.  I thought, I am going to keep my mind open to figure out what I saw.   My ex-husband and I moved to New Mexico, on September 14, 1973.  In 1975, I was watching a movie of Barney and Betty Hill who were abducted by aliens.  Betty explained when the space ship took off it was engulfed in flames and as it took off the flames dissipated.  This is what I saw in Wisconsin.
