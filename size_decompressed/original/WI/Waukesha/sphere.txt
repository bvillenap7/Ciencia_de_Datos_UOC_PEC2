((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I am sorry and do not know how I could have put 1925 as my mother was not even born yet. Yes I am serious and yes it should have stated 2005. I also have another incident that took place today. I don't know if I should report it on the web site or not. I was skeptical about reporting the sighting that has prompted you to send me this e-mail. I hope that something within my lifetime will come forth, be it from any government or from an actual undeniable E.T. contact ending the mystery and feelings from seeing unnatural and unexplainable things. If I had not been the only one to see these things I would have kept it to myself as I have in the past. Thank You, ((name deleted));42.9988508450702;-88.2323685211281
