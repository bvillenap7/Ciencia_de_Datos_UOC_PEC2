Strange interaction with men in black;1992-08-01 16:00:00;2 minutes;Strange interaction with men in black I can’t be certain but this most probably happened in the summer of 1992 which would have been the summer before my senior year in high school.   I was hanging out in the driveway at my best friend’s house on N. Greenfield Ave. in Waukesha, WI between E. Broadway and Ellis St.  I had parked my 1980 Chevy Malibu on the curb in front of his house.  As my best friend and I  (and possibly one or two of his other brothers, I don’t remember) were standing in the driveway a new black Lincoln Town Car with tinted windows pulled up behind my car, blocking the driveway.  As soon as it stopped three men (possibly four, I can’t remember) including the driver got out of the car, walked up to the sidewalk and faced us.  They all were all wearing black suits and dark tinted sunglasses all of them normal build and physically fit.  The strangest part of the incident that I recall is that the one man immediately addressed me, as if he knew the Malibu was my car.  I will give you $2000 cash for your car.  He was as far as I can remember totally expressionless, as were the others.  As far as I was reading into the interaction, he would hand me cash and drive the car away immediately.  Apparently a title was not an issue.  Still kind of dazed by the weirdness of it all, the only thing that I managed to reply was,  It’s not mine to sell, its my dad’s, which was true.  That was it, they made no more attempts at trying to deal.  They turned around without a word and drove north on N. Greenfield.  They didn’t stop at any other houses as far as we could see.  At the time I knew nothing of men in black stories nor did my friend.  We both stood there awestruck and after rehashing the event came to the conclusion that two grand wasn’t worth being implicated in a felony acted out by clean cut secret service types.  Interestingly enough my dad sold the car a few weeks later, I think he got less than $500 for it.  My friend may be willing to back up my claim, if he remembers.  I haven’t seen him for almost five years but it was such an odd event we reminisced on it a few times after it happened.  P.S.  I wasn't sure if this site was appropriate for this type of sighting - please feel free to forward onto more appropriate channels if need be.
