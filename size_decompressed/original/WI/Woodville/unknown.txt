Red blinking objects similar to airplanes or stars that does not move newly appeared in sky two weeks ago.;2011-11-03 19:21:00;2 weeks;Red blinking objects similar to airplanes or stars that does not move newly appeared in sky two weeks ago For the last two weeks I have been seeing one planet/airplane object in the Northern sky that doesn't move.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but it never left its position.  It blinks rapidly between red, white and possibly green or blue.  I thought it could possibly be a satellite and shrugged it off.  After seeing this object in the same location for the last two weeks, my curiosity has gotten to me.    Tonight, while outside I see another one exactly the same size and appears to be the same distance away off to the Northwest.  I asked my family to come outside and see if they are seeing the same thing or if I'm just crazy.  They also thought it was an airplane until I asked them to go look after five minutes.  They both were still there. I have no idea what these could be.  Maybe they are just satellites, but these weren't there two weeks ago and the second one only appeared tonight.  Very curious;44.9429;-92.2896
