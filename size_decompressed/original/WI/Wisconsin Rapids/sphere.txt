I HAD CONCLUDED IT MIGHT BE VENUS, ALTHOUGHT IT SEEMED OUT OF PLACE. I WASN'T ABLE TO LOOK AT THE SAME SPOT IN THE SKY FOR ABOUT A WEEK BECAUSE OF CLOUDS AND MIST UNTIL LAST NIGHT, AT 1AM WHEN THE SKY WAS CLEAR. I COULD SEE NO OBJECT OF ANY SIZE. ANYWHERE NEAR THE PLACE I HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEN THE BRIGHT OBJECT.  I LIVE IN CENTRAL WISCONSIN. I SAW THIS BRIGHT OBJECT ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO. IT SEEMED TO BE UNUSUALLY LARGE AND BRIGHT IN AN UNLIKELY SPOT IN THE SKY. THIS LOOKED LIKE A VERY LARGE STAR OR A PLANET. IT APPEARED SLIGHTLY NORTH OF DUE EAST, AT ABOUT A 35-40 DEGREE HIGHT. I HAD NOTICED IT WHEN DRIVING HOME FROM A 24 HOUR WALMART AT 1AM. WHEN I GOT HOME I LOOKED AT IT WITH AN 8 POWER SCOPE. IT WAS ROUND, NOT BLINKING, AND SEEMED TO BE REFLECTING SUN LIGHT, SUCH AS A PLANET. IT WAS ABOUT 1/8 INCH IN DIAMETER AS SEEN WITH THE SCOPE. IT DID NOT APPEAR TO MOVE AND WAS IN VIEW AS LONG AS I WATCHED, ABOUT 15 MINUTES. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  May be Venus that the witness is observing.  PD));44.3772912751678;-89.8245926174498
