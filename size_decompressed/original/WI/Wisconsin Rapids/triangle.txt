Large,low flying triangle;2002-08-02 21:30:00;10 sec.;Large,low flying triangle My wife,daughter,&sister-in-law were sitting on our patio, and I was in the house watching TV.I told them to let me know if they saw anything in the sky out of the ordinary.I've seen numerous strange lights going in many different directions and I don't think they're satellites.They are at varying heights and glow at different levels of brightness.In May I saw a chevron shaped object that had a transparecey to it and it was of a fairly low altitude that flew over the north end of my house.I reported that to W-Files/UFO Wisconsin.I think my family thought I was a little bit whacko but I'm out every clear night looking and I know what I've seen.Anyway,I went out by the girls and they said they saw a white light moving across the sky but it could of been just about anything I guess.I was looking east over my house at the time and saw a dark triangle heading west directly over us and told the girls where it was.Thankfully they all saw it so it made me feel a bit better.This thing was about the size of a 747 or larger.I would guess it to be 300 to 400 feet up.It was kind of transparent like the other craft I saw but it showed a little more structure when it was passing directly overhead and as it was moving away to the west.It seemed to have some type of rectangular grid pattern across the back of it.There were points when you could see stars or what looked to be stars through it.When you see something like that it stretches your mind a bit because you can't get your mind prepared to see something it would'nt ever expect to see.I asked everyone who saw it what they felt from this and they all said fear and evil.I felt the same.;44.3772912751678;-89.8245926174498
Triangler shaped object by the placement of 3 bright lights spread aways apart;2013-11-01 17:00:00;ongoing;Triangler shaped object by the placement of 3 bright lights spread aways apart We were driving east on Hwy 73, when we noticed out in the distance above a field 3 triangular lights, red and blue.  The lights were spaced far enough apart, that it did not look familiar in any way.  It was also standing still in the air and did not move.  The 3 lights were round and very bright, also somewhat large looking at them, and they formed a triangular position.  We all seen it and couldn't explain it.  We kept driving, and it disappeared when we looked back.  I go down that road everyday and always look in that area of the field, and have never found any other explanation for what we seen.  I am first writing this now, cuz I never got this out of my mind, and I have been hearing other familiar reports of this shape of whatever it was.  There was no sound.  It was a very clear night;44.3772912751678;-89.8245926174498
