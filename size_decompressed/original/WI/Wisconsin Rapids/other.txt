Glowing red object flying across sky ten times faster then jet!!!!!!;2001-06-13 23:10:00;5-?min.;Glowing red object flying across sky ten times faster then jet!!!!!! appeared like a star only reddish-orange, thought it might be an airplane at first only it moved very fast across the eastern sky, from north to south and then met up with two other stars and traveled back from south to north. I am writing this for my husband and I saw it myself, it moves very quickly across the sky, it looks like an air plane at first but it moves at least ten times faster and it switched from N. to S. Then it stopped, two of the stars close together and the other one a little farther away not moving.  The two stars then just floated in the sky while 5 minutes later an even brighter red glowing object flew across the sky.;44.3772912751678;-89.8245926174498
