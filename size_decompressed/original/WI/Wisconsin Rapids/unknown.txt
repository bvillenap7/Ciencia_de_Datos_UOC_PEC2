There is one area of light bigger than a star moving erratically in the sky. There are several colors. Through a binoculars it looked like a central light source with a web of lights around it. It stayed close to the horizon but our neighbor saw it move before we showed up. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the sighting is not inconsistent with that of a  twinkling star.  However, confirmation would require a star chart,  or triangulation.  PD));44.3772912751678;-89.8245926174498
