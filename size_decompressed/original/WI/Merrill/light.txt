Zig zagging moving with incredible speed.  Repeated sightings in a week's time. My sister, her two boys and my one child were sitting out by our home by a campfire.  My sister pointed to the skys and from the Northwesterly area were three fast moving objects, they would have looked like stars, except they were moving. They moved up and down and and back and forth, but eventually went in a South Easterly direction and disappeared. The next night we watched and saw the objects again acting in the same manner and going the same way. The next night and the next my kid went out and he saw the same objects doing about the same thing. We have not gone out to watch for them this year. They can not be anything we know about as far as planes, or any other ship that we have seen because they move in such a way fast, up and down and zig zagged .. their speed is incredible, because of the distance away and as fast as they move, they are hundreds of times faster than any jet I have ever seen, and no craft I know of moves like these do.;45.1783;-89.6914999999999
