No surrounding stars in that area. We sat and looked at it for around 20-30 minutes.  While looking at it we saw a very small orange/red light falling and a slow speed under the trees.  While looking at the very large and very bright white light we could see it sway left and right acutely. We finished our cigarette and proceeded to go inside the house.  An hour later when we went out to smoke another cigarette, we noticed that both the bright white light and the tiny red light we completely gone.  Nothing to be see.  I will also note that it was extremely quiet outside and no wind, clouds, or other things that could distort our vision.  I will continue to monitor the sky in the surrounding area for the next few weeks to see If it returns or I find something else. P.S. I did attempt to capture pictures of the light, but my cell phone could not capture it.;42.7177;-89.4401
