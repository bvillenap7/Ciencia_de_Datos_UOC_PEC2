((Starlink satellites?));2001-12-21 19:00:00;5 min;We walked out into the front yard, to take the dog out. Its a clear night, and we both looked up at the sky. Slightly off to the left, were at least 6 orbs? They were in a straight line and moved upward toward  and eventually disappearing into the equuleus constellation. They each moved upward, similar to rising in an elevator. Each would go up, and then go out of sight/disappear. They were not crowded either, they were perfectly spaced apart.;42.6669000000001;-88.2629999999999
