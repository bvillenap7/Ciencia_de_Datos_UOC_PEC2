Round red/orange UFO or some kind of object?;2014-04-19 22:45:00;2 minutes;Round red/orange UFO or some kind of object? 10:49pm letting my dog out and I could've just seen a UFO I think flying what seemed to be low for a jet and if it was a jet I would of heard the engine which I heard nothing.   It was bright red/orange with maybe a little bit of green on both sides which is unusual for a plane considering they would be blinking.  It went from SE to NW. Very quickly.  And it even started to startle me a bit.. creepy! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.6669000000001;-88.2629999999999
