They reported seeing a triangle of lights, moving across the sky, with glowing contrails behind the lights.  The lights were in formation, and moving very slowly.  They both reported that it was strange, and kind of eerie.  When I suggested they may have seen a UFO, they both laughed at me and scoffed.  I thought I would report the sighting, in the event anyone else had seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  Space X satellites.  PD));46.1523;-89.8478
