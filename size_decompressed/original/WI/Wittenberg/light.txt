I saw a bright flashing red light at midnight, traveling slowly heading west.  Then it changed direction, and started heading north.  Then it started slowing down.  During all this time I hear a strange noise as well.  After it was slowing down I went inside to get my camera.  By the time I got back it was gone, but I could still hear a strange noise in that direction.  There were tall trees in the way so I couldn't see far away.;44.8243;-89.1662
