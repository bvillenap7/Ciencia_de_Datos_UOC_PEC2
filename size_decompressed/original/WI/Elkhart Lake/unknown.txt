Object with constant green light and flashing white appeared unmoving until it randomly flew away. ((anonymous report));2017-05-04 23:07:00;5 minutes;Object with constant green light and flashing white appeared unmoving for a while until it randomly flew away. There was a very bright, unmoving white light in the night sky.  It was far too bright to be a star.  About two minutes of appearing stagnant, it started moving at a decent speed to the west.   However, when moving, it was a constant green light with a flashing white light unlike common airplanes that have white with flashing red.   It went out of view not too long afterwards, and the shape of it was hard to tell. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be flawed.
