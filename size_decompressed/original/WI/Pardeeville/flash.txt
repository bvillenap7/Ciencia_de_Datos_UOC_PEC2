strange mathimatical lights in the sky.;2004-11-04 21:00:00;about 20 min;strange mathimatical lights in the sky. One night in mid november me and my girlfriend decided, since it was a clear night to take a walk to the mailbox which happens to be about a half a mile away from our home, we live out in the country so the stars are always out in full bloom  .  one our way back, i was looking to the sky.  all of a sudden out of nowhere there was a bright orange burst of light in the sky just above the tree line at my ten o'clock, it lasted about a second or two and it began to disapear, just as it was disapearing another one flashed out, and in the same fashion it did this a total of four times and it apeared to make a division symbol from right to left.  If this was one object then it must have been moving at the speed of light because by the time the first light was disapearing, the next one was there.  when the last of the four lights dimmed out i focused on the area that the lights were in, i was able to spot out a solid very faded white light, going in the oposite direction as before and was going behind the trees, me and my gf ran down the driveway to get to the porch, which over looks a large field, sure enough after a couple of minutes i could see the object coming out from behind the trees, the faint white light, began to dim out at this point, we waited and waited i think about five or ten min went by when the bright orange flash came again, it was huge this time, it apeared to be about the size of a dime from my perspective. two very smaller orange lights then shot towards the ground at 45 degree angles from the object, then the large light dimmed again, then about a min later we saw the four lights in the sky to make a quarter circle, from 12 o'clock first then down to 9 o'clock, on another note none of these objects made any noise at all, and when u can even see a plane or helicopter in the area, u always hear it before u can even see it, and that was the end of the exp. that night but i asure you its not nearly the only strange activity that ive seen out on the farm ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.
