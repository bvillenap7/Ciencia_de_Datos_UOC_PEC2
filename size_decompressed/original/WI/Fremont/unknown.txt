Red lights sling-shooting through the sky.;2017-01-12 20:55:00;5 minutes;Red lights sling-shooting through the sky. As I was driving home on hwy 96 west I saw a red light appear in the sky about 20 degrees above the horizon.  The light was moving right to left, toward the south.  It brightened and began to slowly fade.  But before it faded out, another, separate red light appeared to the left(south) of the first along the same line the first light was moving towards.  The first light then faded. The second light brightened and began to fade, while moving along the same path as the first.  But again, before the second light faded completely, another red light appeared to the south. This sequence happened five or six times.  Then, the lights just disappeared. I asked the other person in the car if they were seeing this and they said yes.  They described it exactly as I had seen it. The sky was slight overcast with a full moon rising behind us.  Orion was visible through the the high overcast. The only other light I saw was five miles down the road when I saw a white light come on and go off, then a quick flash of a white light. This was in the same quadrant of sky.;44.2363;-88.8513999999999
White lights disappearing and reappearing;2017-12-07 21:15:00;30 seconds;White Lights disappearing and reappearing Was driving west on US 10.  I saw 3 lights in the sky west of me.  I woke my wife up to see, as well.  They disappeared by vanishing from outside to inside, then reappeared to the north a short distance away by spreading out.  Now there were 5 lights.   This happened a few more times with the lights moving north each time.   The hair on my arms was standing up after strangest thing I have ever seen.;44.2363;-88.8513999999999
