3 orbs over central Wisconsin.;2016-11-16 17:17:00;<1 minute;3 orbs over central Wisconsin 3 bright orbs at sunset looking west while driving HWY 10, east aprox. 5 miles from Fremont.  Appearing in one position in the sky to disappear and reappear as soon as it disappeared in a different location.  One orb disappearing at a time.  One by one all orbs were gone.   Duration of 6-9 seconds.   Once I arrived home in Stevens Point, I told my roommate of experience and he had same experience looking southward except he saw the lights at two different occasions in the same area of the sky around exactly the time I had.  Based on where we both saw the lights a triangulation to where we were and where we saw the lights puts them over the Plainfield/Almond area.;44.2363;-88.8513999999999

Looked up at stars (facing east) and saw three bright white lights traveling at exact same speed heading south. They were equidistant from each other the entire time, no sound, constant bright light. Appeared to be at height of a jet. They moved very fast.;44.2363;-88.8513999999999
