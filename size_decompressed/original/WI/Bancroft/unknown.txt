Driving in a southernly direction between approx. 8:15 PM and 8:30.  Moon was rising to my left.  I saw two lights south of the moon.  At first, I thought they were planes, and my next thought was My God, they are way too close... Even as I had the though another pair of light flashed on, and then another.  They were motionless in the sky.  The cirle of each of their light growing in intensity and size, while each pair of lights maintained the same distance from each other. Then they flared out light the aperature of a lens closing on them.  There seemed to be some sort of irregular starshine or twinkle.  I believed my 11 year old son to be sleeping and looked over at him only to see 2 pairs of the lights at their brighter intensity, joined by another pair.  Seeing he was awake, I asked him if he was seeing what I was seeing.  He said yeah, what is it?  The lights were lined up now like on a circular edge and gave the impression of revolving on that edge. The one on the left going on as the one on the right came on at the same intensity.  It gave the impression of an object turning.  Suddenly the light just diod that closing down to nothing and out thing and were gone. The lights were between 100 and 250 feet in the air and out over an open field.  There were no buildings, streelights, roads, etc. visible.  There were no sounds.;44.3076;-89.5355
