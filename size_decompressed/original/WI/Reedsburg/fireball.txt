I took the dog out to do her business and saw a very bright orange fireball in the direction of Wisconsin Dells.  Within seconds another appeared then another - all in a row.  After the third one the first started to dissappear.  The fifth one appeared above the fourth.  After the fifth dissappeared, the sixth one appeared very high up in the sky.  I stayed outside for awhile but didn't see anything else.  The lights I saw appeared over a neighbors house.  At first I thought it was fireworks due to the flake out festival, but they didn't have any fireworks until the weedend.;43.5295;-90.0005000000001
