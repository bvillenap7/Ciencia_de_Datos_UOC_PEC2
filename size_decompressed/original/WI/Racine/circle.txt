It appeared and then disappeared before my eyes. I was in my hot tub and looked up at the sky.  All of a sudden I saw what appeared to be a round air craft with white, yellow, and red lights on it.  It lasted approx. 2-3 seconds and then disappeared.  I thought it was a plane that went behind a cloud, but then I realized there were no clouds in the direction I was looking.  I did not hear any noise from the object.  Usually when I see planes over head, I can also hear them.  I was in my back yard on the deck which faces east.  I saw the object in the east and a little north of my house.  I live right near lake Michigan and Wisconsin Electric Power Plant is north of us.  I have heard from people in the past that they have sighted UFO'S around the power plant over the lake, but this is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.  It was awesome yet scary.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272

It was moving about 2000 knots. then dissappearsd ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  Probable hoax, we suspect.  PD));42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
Red-orange sphere Racine;2014-08-31 21:23:00;30 seconds;Red-orange sphere Racine Sitting outside in our back yard and witnessed a red-orange sphere, making no sound, traveling from the south to the north.  Because of the way it flickered, we imagined it was a candle fed lantern, but as there is little to no wind near the ground and in the upper atmosphere (the clouds are close to stationary), I can't imagine that a lantern could cover the amount of distance this sphere travelled in the amount of time it did.   I do not know what altitude or the size this object was so that makes it hard to estimate how fast it was moving but even if it were small and even if it was close I would estimate it was moving hundreds of miles per hour. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Thank you for your response.  Yes, the sighting was yesterday 08/31/14.  As far as reporting this to the news, I am really not interested in the publicity.  I was just mostly interested to see if anyone else had seen the same thing we did.  Thought it might be an interesting addition to your sight as well.  Thanks,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
