Odd lights in formation appering and disappering.;2012-10-01 20:00:00;15 minutes;Odd lights in formation appering and disappering. I and 4 other people just watched 4 non blinking orange lights in a pattern disappear and come back in a separate section.  They then moved slowly across the sky and then disappeared one at a time.  They have continued this pattern for about 15 minutes Not sure what it is but in my 32 years I have never seen something like this.  If you know what it is please let the public know.

When I looked up I noticed 4 bright orange lights in the sky that formed a perfect square, after about 6 or 7 minutes the first light disappeared then number 2, then 3 and a minute or two later number 4 disappeared.  I have no clue what to make of it! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
