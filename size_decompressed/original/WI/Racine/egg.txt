Multiple Silver disc/egg shapes slowly hovering over coastal Lake Michigan/Racine.;2019-10-07 17:31:00;4 minutes;Multiple Silver disc/egg shapes slowly hovering over coastal Lake Michigan/Racine. 6-8 silver discs in direct sunlight.  Objects faded in and out, the lead objects had a reddish hue, and the generally formed a v and them a circlular shape.  Multiple airlines passed for my personal comparison.  They disappeared soon after we started videoing and none are apparent on devices.  I believe they were just too far.  My video started while the last once was still visible.  I’d consider the possibility of weather balloon explanation except the way they disappeared, they didn’t fade away bc or distance they disappeared.  They were far but not that far to disappear from sight.  I was looking east and was located in west Racine. We have a 1 min video I’ll try to send.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
