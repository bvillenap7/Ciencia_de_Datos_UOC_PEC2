A triangular shaped aircraft with three lights and a red haze-like glow seen in southern Racine County.;2002-02-07 20:00:00;about 1 min.;A triangular shaped aircraft with three lights and a red haze-like glow seen in southern Racine County. At approx. 8:00 pm (Central Time), on Thursday February 7, 2002, a triangular shaped object flew fairly low (only a few thousand feet up) over the south-eastern sky. It was flying south-east to north-west and was going at least twice the speed of normal aircraft I have seen in the area. As it traveled, it emmitted no sound at all. It had three lights, one at each tip, that were flashing in an odd pattern. It also had a red haze along one side, so I could clearly see it was triangular in shape.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
Extra Terrestrial;2012-01-29 22:03:00;9-10 minutes;Extra Terrestrial I was outside last night shoveling snow.  I was shoveling and i looked up and saw 3 strange blue lights hovering over Lake Michigan.  There were 3 of them in a triangular formation.  Each light was an oval ship that were blue with an aura around them.  They hovered there for about 9 to ten minutes.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen before.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272

I just stepped outside to smoke a cigarette looked up to gaze at a planet I could see good tonight and just as I did I saw a triangle shaped object moving silently through the sky.  It had solid clear lights at the edges of the craft in a triangle shape and absolutely no sound.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
