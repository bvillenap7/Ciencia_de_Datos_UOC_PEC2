Craft hovering stationary over trees in residential neighborhood;1977-07-01 02:00:00;5 min.;Craft hovering stationary over trees in residential neighborhood Back in aprox. 1977 at the age of 10 I awoke unexpectedly in the middle of the night and immediately went to my window and pulled back the shade.  I could never determine what caused me to do this.   I witnessed a saucer shaped object hovering stationary over what would be our neighbors back yard.  It was aprox.  40' off the ground and 30 yards from my position and did not move or emit any sound.  I would estimate it's size as 35' diameter and 8' in height.   The top had a smaller diameter of perhaps 10' and there was a bank of multicolor lights slightly above where the diameter decreased.  These lights did not blink or flash but were rather in a constant on mode.   I observed the craft for what I would estimate to be 5 minutes.  At that point I recall becoming extremely frightened and quickly climbing back in to bed under the covers until I fell asleep again.  I related the sighting to my parents in the morning.  I do not believe I had ever heard of UFO's at that point in life, and not until many years later when finding a book about UFO's in the library did I realize what it may have been I saw.  No subsequent sightings of note.  If I can provide additional info I can be reached at email below.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
Disk shaped craft with amber/orange light, flying low without sound.;2014-08-30 23:23:00;30 seconds;Disk shaped craft with amber/orange light, flying low without sound. On 8/30/2014 at 23:23, we observed a disk shaped craft in the night sky.   When we first saw the craft, the craft was lit up with an amber/orange colored light.  We immediately started to discuss the craft and as soon as we spoke about it, the light dimmed and turned off, as if to camouflage itself from view.   The craft was still visible even without the light, as it was flying very low and was quite large.  The craft moved rather quickly but made no noise as it moved above us.   The craft continued to fly past and eventually, we lost view of it.  This was not an airplane or helicopter.  This was something much, much different and something I have never seen before.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
