It looked like a meteor to all 3 of us, it was very bright and had a tail behind it.  It was moving quite fast and none of us thought at the time it was more.  The next day there where reports that a plane went down and there where lights in the water.  There was a search the next day by the Coast Guard, but nothing was found.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272

As stated above, it was a rather large fireball, I've seen several, and this one was spectacular.  The most interesting quality was the duration and angle of descent.  It seemed like  30-40 degree angle and it was traveling, at what seemed to be a slow speed.  But in actuality, you could see parts of the meteor breaking up.  It was quite beautiful.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
