At 12:13am on January 6, 2019, me and my girlfriend saw an object shaped like a diamond with 4 lights directly above us...they appeared to be stars, at first, but only a few hundred feet above.   We stopped the car and got out, as we looked for about 5 seconds out of the car it began to take off slow than really fast till we chased it for 10 seconds in the car before we lost sight of it headed over Milwaukee...   Object moved like a stealth plane making no noise and made turns left to right normal air crafts don't. but again I could see thru it as it copied the night sky.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
