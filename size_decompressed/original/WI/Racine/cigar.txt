She said there was a single engine plane that had a shiny peg shape behind it.  She said it was shiny silver and looked like a cigeratte.  She is not one much for UFO but based on her description I sent her several images of a cigar shaped UFO from online.  She picked out this one and said this was the one was a lot like the one that was behind the mall engin plane.  She was driving around 3 mile road and Wyoming Way.   There is a small airport near by but since she is not a UFO person, for her to describe a sighting like this, I figured it was worth posting.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
