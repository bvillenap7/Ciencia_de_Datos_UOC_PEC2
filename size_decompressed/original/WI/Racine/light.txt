White light;2004-05-15 22:30:00;approx. 4 min.;While looking into the night sky, I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the comet that was on the weather report, I was looking at the big dipper and noticed a bright  light, as bright as the stars around it and seemed to be as high, it was moving from south to north. I watched the light move in a straight line for about 8 seconds, then it disappeared for about 5 seconds and reappeared a short distance from the first sighting as though it was traveling at a constant velocity. It disappeared again and reappeared about 3 seconds later a short distance from the last appearance and going in the same direction only this time the white light got very bright and tunnel like as though a massive spotlight was shined in my direction. The spotlight effect lasted for about 3 seconds and then disappeared. After about 5 seconds I saw what looked like a comets tail in a redish orange and white mix (what was creating the tail was not visible) originating along the same line of motion as the lights but considerably farther north. This comet like tail made a large arc towards the ground and disappeared long before it would have hit the ground. It should be noted that when the light became a comet like tail, it accelerated to what I would estimate, based on seeing high altitude airlines flying at what I assume is 500 mph, to be moving at 4000+ mph. I think this may have been a decaying satelite but the white light especially the super white light with the tunnel effect has me wondering.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
High Altitude Fast Moving light that changed direction 90 degrees in less than a second and continued at same speed.;2004-09-09 20:35:00;2 minutes;High Altitude Fast Moving light that changed direction 90 degrees in less than a second and continued at same speed. My wife and I were out on our patio tonight in Racine, Wisconsin (about 20sm south of Milwaukee), at about 8:35pm.   A beautiful night here in Wisconsin.   I had spent the early morning installing solar patio lights, and my wife wanted me to come outside and view my handiwork first hand.  After viewing the great job I did installing the lights, she looked up at the clear sky and said...its beautiful, look at all the stars!..      I then noticed one light that was moving at a high rate of speed.   It's altitude was very high.  I am an airline pilot with over 12,000 hours experience.   I started flying when I was 18 years old and I am now 39.   I started in General Aviation and today my job is a First Officer flying passenger jets for a regional air carrier.  I know the characteristics of aircraft and how they behave. This was no aircraft.   My wife and I both watched the object as it moved from WSW to ENE....and then it turned 90 degrees left (North) and maintained the same rate of speed.  It made the turn instantaneously.  I  mean like a 90 degree turn that you would draw on a piece of paper.  No aircraft that I know about can do that.   As a member of AMSAT, I also know satellites and how they perform.   Satellites don't make 90 degree turns either.  There were no NAV lights or strobes, just a ball of white light. I would estimate that its altitude at above 60,000 feet.  In fact when it went by, I pointed and showed my wife and said look honey a satellite...and then about 10 seconds later in the blink of an eye.....it turned 90 degrees and disappeared from view within about 20 seconds.  The luminosity of the object never faded.  There was no sound or trail as with a meteor or bolite.   In 21 years of flying professionally, I have never seen anything like I saw tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station passed to the south of Racine at 20:10 hrs. on this date, so if the time estimate by the witness is correct, the object could not have been the ISS.  However, given that he is a professional pilot, we suspect that the time he indicates above is accurate, which would rule out a sighting of the ISS.   Please see report from same witness from Binghamton, NY, on February 22, 2006.  PD));42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
bright object rising out of lake michigan.;2007-08-29 21:00:00;15 minutes;bright object rising out of lake michigan. While sitting at the end of a dead end road we all witnessed a bright object rise out of Lake Michigan and go straight up out of the lake and hover for approx. 30 seconds before shooting on a vertical line out of sight in a matterof seconds.   I knew that there was no conventional aircraft that could perform this kind of manuver.I have never seen anything like this before and we were all shell shocked by what we saw. After reporting oue experience to local law enforcement we were told that there were more than 6 reported sightings for the same thing.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
Intense, stationary  light in western sky, then disappears.;2008-01-14 18:20:00;3 minutes;Intense, stationary  light in western sky, then disappears. As I left to go to the store, I noticed an extremely bright light at 1030 on the western horizon.  At first, I thought it might be Jupiter, but it was in the wrong place and even brighter.  The more I gazed intently, the more it seemed like two very intense lights side by side very high in the sky.  I checked for any movement and found none.  Then, it seemed like a low-intensity red light appeared on it's right side.  I observed carefully once again to determine if it might be an aircraft (helicopter).  The red glow was NOT blinking, but was constant.  It was cold, so I drove west and continued to observe.  I had to turn left, then right again, a manuver that took approximately 15-20 seconds.  Upon returning to a westerly course I resumed my observation, only to discover that the stationary, intense light in the western sky had disappeared completely!   I stopped and got out of my car in disbelief.  It was completely gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Five Orange Lights Flying North Over Racine, Wisconsin, by Lake Michigan.;2014-06-14 22:15:00;3 minutes;Five Orange Lights Flying North Over Racine Wisconsin by Lake Michigan I had an interesting sighting last night, Saturday June 14, 2014, at 10:15 pm.  I am on the north side of Racine, WI, very close to Lake Michigan.   My husband and I saw two orange lights traveling across the western sky from south to north.  They were positioned one on top of the other.  They were at the top of the tree level.    No sooner had they crossed behind a tree, another orange light approached from the south.   This happened 2 more times for a total of 5 orange lights, slow moving south to north, until they appeared on the other side of the tree, then they turned northwest. There was no sound, nor any blinking lights or strobes.   We waited for more, but saw nothing else.;42.7282090381424;-87.8487443615272
Color-shifting bright light moving slowly across night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of star, Sirius??  PD));2014-12-06 21:00:00;2 hours;Color-shifting bright light moving slowly across night sky. Racine, Wisconsin.  USA.  December 6, 2014, late evening (approx 9 to 11 pm)  View from ground to point of light located in southeast direction approx. 35 degree angle above horizon.   Observed for two hours, very clear night, point moving very slowly toward south, almost appeared stationary.   Used small telescope and binoculars.  Point of light changing colors like an LED through full spectrum.  Certainly no “UFO” behavior such as rapid acceleration or change in direction.  Just a very bright, color-shifting point of light.   Moved so slowly must have been very distant or perhaps something more nearby but very small and odd.  Hope to see a reasonable explanation in tomorrow’s newspaper – maybe Santa’s sleigh??
