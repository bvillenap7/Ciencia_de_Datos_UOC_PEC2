Emerald teardrop light with golden sparking trail with no emenating light.;2016-11-10 21:43:00;4-7 seconds;Emerald teardrop light with golden sparking trail with no emenating light. My mother was driving my teenage brother and I (23 years old) coming back from Marshfield, Wisconsin, just south of Colby,  I was lazily gazing out the front passenger side window, when I spotted a vibrantly bright emerald colored teardrop shaped light with a golden/orange sparking trail about 350ft to 400ft up and about 250 to 300 yards away from the road we were driving on.   At first I thought it was a shooting star and i shouted for my little brother in the back seat to look because my mother was driving, but it moved too slowly for the first few seconds to be a shooting star and then in the blink of an eye (a split second) it shot away from us (rough estimate) 65 degree angle and disappeared.   The strangest thing I noticed was that the emerald green light looked different than a light you normally would see at night.  It had no glare or beams of light coming off it like a street light at night normally would.  It was a solid green teardrop shaped ball of light abo! ut the size of a bowling ball that was extremely bright and yet had no light emanating from it.  The trail looked to be 4 1/2ft to 6ft long from our location with a very slight downward curve.  It was solid white in the center with golden/orange sparks surrounding the center.  The trail was thicker at the end and only slightly narrower towards the emerald light.  The sparks seemed to be falling off the trail.
