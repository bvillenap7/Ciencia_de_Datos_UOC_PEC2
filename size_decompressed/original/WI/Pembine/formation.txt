We both noticed a formation moving across the sky.  3 bigger lights with a smaller one before the final third one.  Looked like Orion's Belt moving across the sky at a decent speed.  It was headed Northeast, once it started to pass over the horizon, it appeared to break formation with the smaller one vanishing first. the middle one flew out and vanished, then first, then the last.
