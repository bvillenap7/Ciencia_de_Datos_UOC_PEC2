Hovering/slow moving, color-changing bright light, with very fast, erratic “dancing” movements.;2019-08-31 23:00:00;20 minutes;Hovering/slow moving, color-changing bright light, with very fast, erratic “dancing” movements. My husband and I walked out onto our dock at our family lake cottage in Northern Wisconsin.  It was the new moon.  The skies were dark and clear.  We were looking for the northern lights (reports said conditions were favorable to see them). My eye caught a very bright light above the tree line, in the distance (North West), that I originally thought was a planet.  I stopped for a closer look. The light changed colors (red, yellowish, white).  Then I saw it move.  Very fast, “erratic”, non-patterned movements.  When not doing this, it appeared to be hovering.  It would hover for a minute, and then move erratically, basically returning to the same hovering position (repeatedly).  The movements were so fast, that I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me!  But then I called others over, and they saw the same “jigging”, “dancing” movements.  Very slowly, it moved beyond our sight (past tree line), while doing the occasional, fast movements.  No sound.  Observers are adults ages 34-36 (naturalist, artist, engineer/former Marine).;45.2601;-88.0819
