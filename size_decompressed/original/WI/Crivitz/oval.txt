It was about quarter to 10PM WI time on Tuesday, July 13, 2010.  The weather is clear, and stars are visable.  I thought the stars might be out as it looked like it would be a clear night, so I went out on the porch to look.   I noticed a very bright, white star very low to the earth in the west, it was just above the trees and about 1000 feet away from where I was standing.  It was hovering in one spot over our marsh in the west.  I went to get the binoculars and went down stairs and outside to get a better look at it as stars are never that low. I looked and saw bright lights around it's rim, it had what could be described as feelers protruding from the edges of it.  It was oval pie shaped and danced in one place, tilting up and then down, like if I held a pie tin oval shaped with a point down and then back up level so the pie would not fall out.  The lights danced and dimmed and brightened.  One bright, white, light beam seemed to be directed my way. I saw the lights change color to red but it was muted in tone, soft like, barely noticeable.  By about 10:25 it no longer showed itself.  The funny thing is the west was totally dark as if no stars in the west at all. I was quite excited to see something so unusual.  I wondered about it.  What is it?  What is it doing over our marsh?  Where did it come from?  Earlier this evening (about 8:00PM) the satellite dish had some interference and did not work.  I called the internet dish company and there was an overload of callers with the same trouble.  I called both the Wausaukee police and the Crivitz police.  I left a message for the Crivitz police chief.;45.2601;-88.0819
