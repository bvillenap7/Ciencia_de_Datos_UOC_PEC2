I was fishing at the locks when I felt a low bass vibration feeling that intensified fairly quickly.  The hair on my body stood up and a bright flash went directly over me head from behind me to in front.  It was at approx. a 45Â° angle to the ground, and then it slammed into the marsh beyond a copse of trees where I couldn't see past.   Then immediately a huge pastel colored flash and a weird whop whop whop noise that I can only explain as a springy type sound that got less and less like an echo.   I left right that second and didn't go back for a few minutes to pick up my fishing equipment. It was a terrifying experience, that I'm sure was not of this world as I've witnessed three separate incidents in my life, and have a strange group of memories from my youth that I believe are of me being abducted on a few different occasions.   I never heard of any other reports about that night over the lake but I know what I saw.  Jj;42.9318;-89.2201000000001
