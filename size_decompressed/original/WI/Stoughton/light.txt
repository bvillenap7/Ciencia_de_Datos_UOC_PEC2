It stood out to me because it was a brilliant blue daytime sky at the time I first saw it. At first I dismissed it thinking it was a planet, but my eyes kept being drawn to the light throughout the day.  Later that evening around 11 p.m. I was alone on the dock and still looking at the light. I remember thinking that it was so strange that it was still in the same exact spot and still the brightest object in the sky. Then, as I watched, it started moving westward, towards me, in an erratic fashion. It seemed to zig-zag rapidly back and forth, still just a bright white light in the sky (or, possibly alternating blinking lights at either side of a wing?). After about 20 seconds of rapid zig-zagging, it shot off in a straight northwest direction and disappeared behind the tree line.  I always suspected it was an odd aircraft on route to the Madison Airport, but I always look to the sky hoping for a repeat performance or for proof it was an airplane. I've never seen anything like it since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.9318;-89.2201000000001
