Shortly after I saw a single one, followed by more and then more. I ran inside to have my girlfriend look. I ran back outside to see about 10 lights all following the same track as the others.  It was a cloudy evening and all were below the cloud line. By the time my awe subsided, I grabbed binoculars to see if I could make out a shape I was too late.  There was only one in the sky and I only caught a glimpse in the binoculars before it faded away like the rest. I thought maybe a group let off some Chinese lanterns or something like that, but the wind was coming from WNW.  So they would not have traveled in the way they did. I have never witnessed anything like this... EVER, and my hairs stand up every time I think of it. Please all, keep your eye to the sky.;43.5248;-88.1899
