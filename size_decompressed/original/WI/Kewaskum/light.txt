Seemingly bright star speeds away into night sky.;2008-08-19 00:00:00;5 minutes;Seemingly bright star speeds away into night sky. This object just looked like a bright star in the sky. I was sitting around the camp fire with two friends around midnight and noticed a bright star in the sky. I had see the same star throughout the night and just thought it was interesting. My friends and I were looking at the rest of the night sky, when suddenly the first star we saw slightly moved. All three of us turned our attention to the object as it got brighter. For about 5 minutes we watched the object grow brighter and then dim. The light then got very bright and sped west into the night sky. The light left a faint trail that disappeared after a few seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.5248;-88.1899
