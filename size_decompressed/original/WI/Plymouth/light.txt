Began to move slow for 1 min., then streaked away VERY fast. I am a housewife and the mother of five.  My ten year old son and I were at the fireworks display at the park in Plymouth, WI.   Before the display began we noticed that directly above our heads was an object.  My son first saw it and commented that it looked like an arrow.  The light were white with a very slight blue tinge compare to the brught planets.  The object was about five to eight times brighter than a planet that was also visible.  It stayed stationary for a long period of time, about 20 minutes later I saw a second obect, same shape but appeared to be father away,maybe 3 times brighter than the planet.   I wasn't constantly watching,but I know that by ten o'clock the 2nd object was gone. There was a large group of people sitting 10 feet in front of us and I know they saw it to because we could hear them talk about it, wondering what it was.  As the grand finale started[fireworks] I saw that it was slowly moving from north to south. Then after a little while it moved fery fast sort of arcing to the south and it was gone.  This was during the last few fireworks.  Do you suppose they're watching fireworks?  Do you think they were our own experimental aircraft?;43.7537;-87.9757000000002

It was coming straight down, low in the southeast.  It did not streak across like a meteorite or have any type of tail as it came down.  It was the largest and lowest falling object I have ever seen.  Seemed like it was very near considering the size.   No noise was heard.;43.7537;-87.9757000000002
