UFO to the North - bright starlike object just above the horizon that flashes colors from red to green.... ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2008-08-06 01:00:00;Continuous;UFO to the North - bright starlike object just above the horizon that flashes colors from red to green..... I discovered the following UFO report by an investigator named, Delbert Anderson and involves an event in late- July 1991.  His Report below, completely describes the exact same thing that I have been encountering on more than one occasion(same time 1:00am)and in the exact location in the evening sky.  I, however, am not convinced they are stars or abnormal atmospheric conditions....... The UFO seems to still be there (long periods of time) and an airplane traveling tonight during my writing of this report, stayed at a very low altitude while crossing it's path.  Please have an investigative aircraft check into this?  Delbert Anderson Reported late- July 1991: Around 1 a.m. or so the witnesses indicated they were seeing a UFO to the North and there was a bright starlike object just above the horizon. We watched this object for awhile. Over the next 15 or 20 minutes the object got a little brighter. It seemed to flash colors from red to green to blue to white and so on especially when viewed through binoculars.... At approximately 1:30 a.m. the witnesses drew my attention to a bright starlike object over the western horizon. This object was also flashing colors and getting brighter, then dimmer, appearing to approach and recede... (Anderson)  Delbert determined that objects were the bright stars Capella and Antares;43.7537;-87.9757000000002
