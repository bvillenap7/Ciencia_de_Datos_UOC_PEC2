Large saucer floating in clear daylight;2003-05-10 17:00:00;15 seconds;Large saucer floating in clear daylight During the evening of a beautiful cloudless day in May, I arrived home with my sister from her house. As my sister walked into the house, I gathered together a few items in the back of her car and began to walk into my house. As I was walking I noticed a large object hovering slowly over the town of Plymouth near our house. The object was in the shape of a disk and was extremely large from my point of view. It reflected the sun and seemed metallic. The slow moving object was reading north when I decided to run into the house to tell my sister to look outside. Halfway into the house I decided to look as long as possible and not waste time so I ran back outside to find that the UFO was no longer there. In a matter of a second, the UFO had disappeared. The background of the object was clear blue sky. There were no other anomalies in the sky other than the UFO. To this day, I have yet to have a rational idea of what the object could be.
