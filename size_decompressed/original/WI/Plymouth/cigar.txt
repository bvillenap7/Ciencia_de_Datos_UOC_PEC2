My dad and I were coming out of my high school to the parking lot.  In the sky, we saw a very slow moving object with a white light in the front and a flashing red light in the back.  It made a sort of faint humming sound.  We started to follow the object and we got pretty close.   Then all of a sudden, is disappeared, after around 15 minutes, we located it again and it was parallel to the road we were on.  It was probably about a quarter mile to right of us no more than 500 feet in the sky.   It started to move very fast and we were going 40 mph and this object was going faster than us from a quarter mile away.  It had to at least been going 300mph+.  Then it just disappeared.   We searched for around 10 more minutes, but we did not see it again.;43.7537;-87.9757000000002
