As be and my friend we hunting an object that looked like a cloud appeared in the clear sky.  It was a clear morning.  The object was round and looked like it went from vertical to horizontal and disappeared instantly. Then immediately reappeared out of nowhere in the same spot and then collapsed in on itself.  Our sighting only lasted about 5-10 seconds.  I have never seen anything like that in my life.;43.7537;-87.9757000000002
