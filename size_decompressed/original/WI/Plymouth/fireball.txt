Yellow /Orange light  ( fire in the sky) whitnessed by two in Plymouth WI;2012-11-02 21:15:00;6 minutes;Yellow /Orange light  ( fire in the sky) whitnessed by two in Plymouth WI Traveling east on hwy 67 (southwest of Plymouth WI) to pick up a vehicle for repair at about 9:15 pm, turned right on oak rd,passed a man walking his dog, then right on sumac rd.  While traveling west on sumac noticed a light low in the sky that seemed out of context because of the color, I wondered if it was a yard light.   As i approched, I noticed that it was not a yard light and it was close to being directly above a nearby residence.  I slowed down and noticed the orange color, to me it looked like a campfire in the sky.  I sped to my destination which was about a half block away, when i arrived a male family member was walking out of the house, at that point we both noticed the light moving from east to west and he said &quotwhat is that&quot.  We spent the next two minutes trying to figure out what it was as it moved west and then seemed to turn south and rise into the sky while slowly dissapearing.;43.7537;-87.9757000000002
