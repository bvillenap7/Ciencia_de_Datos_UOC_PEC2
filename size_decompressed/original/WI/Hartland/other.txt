Spotted a intense orange and red object in the sky.;2014-07-04 09:00:00;1-2 minutes;Spotted a intense orange and red object in the sky On July 4th 2014 at about 9 pm we were driving down Hwy 16 on the freeway at 65 mph in a convertible we were on the border of leaving Hartland and entering Pewaukee..the rural area.   I looked up and saw something bright orange and red glowing I thought it was something on fire.  I said to my husband what is that?  He said I cant see it!  I could see right up into its bottom though it was high up it was big and a oblong square shape.  And was a intense orange with red lining and looked like it was radiating fire or pulsating red, As we passed it I kept watching it over my right shoulder it stayed there and I kept telling my husband to look in the mirrors it's still there.  He couldn't  see it!   I watched it in my side mirror till I couldn't see it anymore.  At a distance I saw white lights or a white glow on the top of it. I wanted my husband to stop the car or turn the car around cause I wanted to see it again. He just thought I was looney, as I described what I saw, and didn't  believe me.  As I looked at it in my side mirror as we were driving away from it I was comparing its size to the tree line and it was big cause I watched it in the mirror for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes going 65 down the freeway.  I'll never forget the intense orange and red colors or the way it glowed, lights don't glow like this.;43.1171999999999;-88.3446000000003
