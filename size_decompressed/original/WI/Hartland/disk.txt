U.F.O.'s becoming more Frequent in Lake Country Area;2012-10-09 00:15:00;8-10 minutes;U.F.O.'s becoming more Frequent in Lake Country Area 5 disk shaped objects with green and red blinking lights  They would come in close where i could see them and then go farther away where i could barely see them with my binoculars.  It started out just being 1 ufo and then 4 more appeared as i stood there watching them. I go out almost every night looking for them.  The last few nights I've seen quite a few strange objects flying around.  Normally I will spot them just after dark or a little after midnight. Something BIG is about to happen...I can feel it in the air. (THIS IS JUST MY OPINION) ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
