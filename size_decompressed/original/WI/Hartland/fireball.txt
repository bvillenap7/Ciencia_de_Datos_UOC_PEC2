As I looked at it, I noticed three more.  I pulled over to the side of the road and got out of my car and saw a total of 4 orange fireballs. They looked like they were just about equally spaced apart from one another.  It appeared to be quite a distance.  They almost looked like they had kind of a white background to them.   I heard absolutely no noise from them.   It was a clear night with many stars.  There were no lights as you see on airplanes.  The further West they went, they disappeared one by one.  I don't know if they were going into clouds or just vanished.  I am absolutely no judge of distance so I am unable to judge how high they were. The whole thing lasted no more than 2 minutes.;43.1171999999999;-88.3446000000003
Brief, briliant, orange light to the NE.;2012-06-22 10:50:00;2 seconds;Brief, briliant, orange light to the NE. I saw a very brilliant, orange(y),  brief light to the NE.  Event lasted about 2 seconds and looked as if something had burned up entering our atmosphere.  It could have been a meteorite or a satellite?  Brightest when first seen, headed down to the horizon and appeared to be something burning out as the light was very brilliant at first and then dimmed and went out.  It resembled one of those fireworks that are so bright and fall to the ground and extinguish on the way down…other than the light being orange in color, headed towards the ground at a much greater speed than gravity, clearly much farther away and brighter than I had ever seen...including the light from the magnesium in the firework I described. I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.1171999999999;-88.3446000000003
