At about 9:30 pm, as my sister-in-law and I stood outside talking, something in the sky caught my eye. Thinking it was going to be a falling star, I pointed to the sky.  When we looked up we saw two, milky white, opaque circles flying extremely fast and parallel to each other.  They were very low, and compared to a star in the sky, very large.  They made absolutely no sound.  They flew across the sky together and then made a very sharp turn towards each other - I thought they were going to collide.  They crossed paths and then vanished.  They were flying in a northeast direction. We've never seen anything fly so fast, we still can't believe what we saw!;43.4609;-88.8502000000002
