Orange glowing cube near Beaver Dam, WI;2010-07-17 22:30:00;2 Min.;Orange glowing cube near Beaver Dam, WI My son and I were returning home from the Wisconsin Dells Saturday night when my son became increasingly animated about seeing a U.F.O.  I pulled off of Hwy. 33 at the next intersection, got out of my car and spotted a faceted cubic shaped object with a very bright amber light underneath illuminating the craft which appeared to glow orange.  It was almost directly overhead at this point, traveling West to East, and climbing at about the same rate a private plane would.  At this time a State Patrol squad pulled up along side of me and the officer lowered his window and asked what's wrong?   I said My son spotted a U.F.O.-  Take a look  He craned his head out of the window and said Sure enough, the Air Force must be doing some testing tonight   As the object ascended in the distance I got back in the car and traveled at normal Hwy. speed in it's direction but was not able to regain sight again. I've reported this incident to Milwaukee T.V. stations, and they all claim no other reports were filed.;43.4609;-88.8502000000002
