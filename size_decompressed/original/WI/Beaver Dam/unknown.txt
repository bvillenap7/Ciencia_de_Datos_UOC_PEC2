Several high flying dots seen on clear summer evening.;2006-06-23 19:00:00;1-2 min;Several high flying dots seen on clear summer evening. At about 7pm as I was birdwatching in my backyard, I noticed movement in the sky.  I looked up to see 3 shiny or white dots that formed a triangle.  They were so high in the sky that I couldn't make out what each dot was. As I focused in on them, I noticed other dots flying with the three that were in triangular formation.  I quickly ran over to my neighbor's house where my husband and my neighbor and another man were working outside building a garage.  I had a hard time finding the objects in the sky again, as they were so high up, and so small.  Finally, we located them.  We watched the three that were in triangular formation change positions and were no longer flying in a triangle.  My neighbor started counting all the dots and counted at least eight! They kept on changing positions, moving to the left or to the right. We noticed some in pairs (briefly, then they'd change position again) They looked about the same size as a satellite, that you see at night.The speed they were traveling across the sky was about the same speed as a satellite travels as well (maybe a bit slower).  They were flying from the NW to the SE. We were able to watch them for a minute or two before they were not visible to the naked eye any longer. We heard no noise, and they did not leave a contrail.  A commercial jet flew over at the same time, and the objects we saw were much, much, much higher than the jet was flying.  My occupation is a teacher's assistant, my husband is a carpenter, and my neighbor is an engineer.;43.4609;-88.8502000000002
