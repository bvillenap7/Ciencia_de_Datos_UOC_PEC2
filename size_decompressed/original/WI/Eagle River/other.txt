Two bright, quickly moving stars;2008-08-10 23:00:00;3 minutes;Two bright, quickly moving stars My son and I were on our third night of sky watching, during the Perseids meteor shower. We were in the north woods of Wisconsin and the sky was very clear and black. The moon had just set about ½ hour previously. We were both familiar with the usual bright stars in the sky, but then I pointed out two very bright stars in the western sky that were in very close proximity to one another. It was unusual because they hadn’t been seen before. As we watched the stars they began to move upward in the sky and then away from the earth. The bottom star disappeared sooner. We basically watched two bright stars move quickly up and away until they faded completely—all in the span of 1-3 minutes.;45.9173;-89.254
