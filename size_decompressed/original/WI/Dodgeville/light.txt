An orange light in the sky appearing in the southern sky.  Very bright.  slow at first, then accelerating across the sky to the North.  Looked like a forked tail after a bit....before flickering and disappearing.  Definitely not an airplane.  Not blinking at all.  Kind of seemed like a rocket or missile that eventually ran out of propulsion.;42.9696999999999;-90.1368999999999
