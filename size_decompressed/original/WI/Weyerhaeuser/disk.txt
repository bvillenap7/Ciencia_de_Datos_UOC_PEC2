one UFO meets 2 others;1980-12-10 21:00:00;15 min;one UFO meets 2 others It was early Dec and I was coming home from down hill skiing at Christi Mountain north of Weyerhaeuser, WI.  I had just come over Fire Tower Hill when off to my right (to the West) I saw a light.  As I continue to drive south, the object continue to keep the same distance and pace.  After a mile or so I came to the top of a hill and stop and got out of my car.  The object just hung in the sky.  It made a sound which I could not I.D.  It was not a helicopter or plane.  I watched it for a few minutes with nothing happening.  I than began to drive a few minutes late the object flew to the south of my position and met up with 2 other objects in the sky.  The other 2 objects came from southeast and southwest  They hung in the sky for just a few seconds, then they flew straight up and away.  A few day after my sighting a large Army plane was flying over the area pulling a drone shaped from it's bottom.  It made several passes over the entire area of the Blue Hills.  We were told it was looking for minerals in the soil.  During the early 80's and late 70's the military install an ELF (Extermily Low Freq) site in north eastern Wisconsin.  It was used to communicate with subs in the oceans around the world.  It seemed that the siteing increased with this ELF site.  Maybe/maybe not. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
