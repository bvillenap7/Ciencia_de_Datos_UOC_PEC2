To the naked eye, what looked like a very bright star, but appeared much closer than a star, caught my attention for the second time in the last two months.  This time, I got out the binoculars and eventually the video recorder and saw what appeared to be a very large orb moving forward and backward.  While looking through the video recorded, at full zoom, the orb appeared to focus in on me, giving me a glimpse of an eyeball type of configuration.  It had a very dark center and what appeared to be symmetrical structures encircling it.  The movement was very erratic and quick when looking through the camera but to the naked eye, was just bright and flashing.  After about half an hour, the orb seemed to show other colors inside the dark center, possibly red.  My husband observed through the binoculars and saw two objects, one seemingly beaming light on the other one.  At the end of the experience, the lights descended in to the horizon and left us with about seven glowing red lights that we could see through the trees.  The glowing red lights were visible for at least an hour or two after.;43.6059;-88.2699
