Craft going West turned completely around heading back East;1999-03-03 21:00:00;15 minutes;Craft going West turned completely around heading back East Craft was triangular in shape, it was night so all I saw were lights, 6 red lights, not blinking, 3 on one side and 3 on the other and one yellow light in back. Shape looked similar to flock of geese formation. Thought it was huge aircraft flying very low (it was huge) but there was little sound with it. Thought it was strange it headed East towards Lake Michigan turned completely around and headed straight West. Just before it went over there were 4 airplanes traveling east together and then this craft came from the east. I am a skeptic and always thought people were exagerating when they told of sightings, so when I saw this I was in awe and it actually took my breath away. I am still trying to find an explanation for it because as I said I am a skeptic. I have been looking at pictures  of B-2 stealth bombers and that is just the form it looked like, but I can't find any pictures of the stealth at night so I do not know if it has 6 red lights on it or not.;43.6059;-88.2699
