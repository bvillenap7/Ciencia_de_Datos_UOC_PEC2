Spherical object came into view from the east over the body of water Green Bay outside of the Ellison Bay harbor.  It appeared to be spherical, with a slight tail, glowing orange.   Its movement, or path, was unusual, in that it appeared to move forward (towards us) and then veered sideways, was rather erratic, not completely smooth in its track.    Also, its speed wasn't that of any object with which we were familiar.      It continue to move like that, now in a southerly direction, and moved away from us.     We watched it until it was out of our sight, hidden by trees and the mere fact that the distance between us and the object became too great.     We have pictures on our phones.;45.2561;-87.0567
