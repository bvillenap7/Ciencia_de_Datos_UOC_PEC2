TWO LIGHTS MOVING AS ONE WITH A BEAM OF LIGHT PRECEEDING THEM;2001-07-22 03:30:00;five minutes;TWO LIGHTS MOVING AS ONE WITH A BEAM OF LIGHT PRECEEDING THEM The object we saw consisted of two lights moving together with a slightly curved shaft of light coming off of what was presumably the front of the craft.  It moved about 30 degrees off the North towards the East, where we were watching an electrical storm over Newport State Park on the Door County peninsula in northern Wisconsin.  Only after reading a similar report from an observer in Thunder Bay, Ontario, did we feel like posting our sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD));45.2561;-87.0567
