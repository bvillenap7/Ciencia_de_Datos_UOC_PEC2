I was driving south on Port Washington Rd, Mequon, WI at about 6pm, when I saw what at first appeared to be an airliner on fire in the night sky. I slowed my vehicle and sturned into a parking lot to watch. The object was a brilliant, blue-green fireball. It came from just south of due west, and headed just north of due east. The object was breaking apart and parts were breaking in many directions in back. It appeared to be low in the sky. I had observed the leonids in 98, and this object appeared much more massive, detailed, and took approx 2.5 minutes to arc across the evening sky. I lost sight of the object as it disappeared over the horizon (Lake Michigan.) I returned home in Mequon, called the television station and returned outside. A full ten minutes after the event, two faint, parrallel contrails were still visible from the path the object had followed in the sky..;43.2402342342342;-87.9921747747749
