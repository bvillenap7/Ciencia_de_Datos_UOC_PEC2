3 triangular shaped white circles with no propulsion on the back.;2007-02-20 19:15:00;1 minute;3 triangular shaped white circles with no propulsion on the back. I didn't see any real body of the craft because it was night. What I did see was 3 white, bright circles in a triangular formation and a fading red light between the back 2. I didn't see any propulsion on the back so the white circles must have been making it hover. I also didn't see the standard flashing red and green lights on airplanes.;43.2402342342342;-87.9921747747749
