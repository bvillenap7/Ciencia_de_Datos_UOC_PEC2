They would disappear and then reappear in a different location.One object seemed to be in the shape of a dome on top. I saw one, then two and three. There were most usually two. The odd thing is that as I was taking pictures of these dark objects, I began to notice the clouds changing aways toward the right of them. I took three pictures of the changing formation. I was using a digital camera and when I took the picture of the large configuration, my camera went totally black except for the normal information readout. I have never had this happen before. I tried repetedly to take a picture and it just wouldn't work. Even the viewfinder was black. I had to turn it off and then turn it on again. By that time the large configuration was gone.;44.0886;-91.3531
