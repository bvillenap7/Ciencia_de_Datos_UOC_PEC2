Bright gold objects flash and disappear.;2013-01-13 15:40:00;5 minutes;Bright gold objects flash and disappear Looking west we entered a Walmart parking lot and saw a very bright gold object in the dark evening sky.  It flashed and then disappeared.  It reappeared and the second time there were two objects very bright gold in color.  They flashed and then disappeared.  Two minutes later we saw another object with the same description.  It flashed and disappeared.  About two minutes after that we heard a very loud jet in the air flying overhead.  We could not see the jet since it was dark.;44.2984;-90.8424
