I was eastbound on I-94 in Black River Falls, WI, approximately 9:30pm, the sky was clear when lights in the sky caught my attention.  As I looked up I could see 5 yellowish lights in a perfect line just hovering there.   All of a sudden they started going out one by one.   As I continued to look up, one started to flicker like it was trying to come back on and finally it did, along with the other four also came back on one at a time!!  They stayed lite for about 5 to 10 seconds before all going out at once!!!  This reminded me of the Phoenix lights but maybe not as big!!;44.2984;-90.8424
