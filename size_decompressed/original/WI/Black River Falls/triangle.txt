Many gold lights on a big triangular shape object, about size of a private airplane;2018-01-25 16:30:00;2 minutes;Many gold lights on a big triangular shape object about size of a private airplane I was driving westbound  on I-94, I believe near Black River Falls, when I noticed far in the north sky a fairly large object with gold lights flying.  It was too far to make out the shape, but looked way bigger then that of an airplane.  Moments later I see another big triangular shape object coming from the north heading south.  This object had many gold lights.  My first thought was possible drone, but this was way too big to be a drone, and I donâ€™t believe drones have lights.   Being on the expressway, I did not want to pull over, but I did get a very good look at this object as I slowed down to witness.  It appeared to be traveling a little slower then a jet plane would be as it lands.   As the object flew over my vehicle, I would estimate that it was perhaps three or four hundred feet in the air, but I could be off with my estimate.  I would say it was about at the height in the sky as a jetliner would be about 45 seconds from touchdown landing.;44.2984;-90.8424
Orange triangular craft followed by military jet;2020-05-14 20:45:00;2 minutes;Orange triangular craft followed by military jet A coworker and I were standing out back of hardees and witnessed a bright orange, triangular shaped craft weave through the sky being followed by a military jet.  We witnessed this craft maneuver UNDER the military jet and then simply disappear.  This craft was so oragnge, and so bright it almost looked like fire. Not to be confused with a fireball, it was NOT spherical, it was triangular.;44.2984;-90.8424
