Hovering circular object with many changing lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a twinkling star?  PD));2019-04-20 22:00:00;1 hour;Hovering circular object with many changing lights 4-20-19 about 10:00 pm - I was in the Black River Falls area - heavily wooded - out watching stars and witnessed something that looked like a star to the west - but after watching it for several minutes, realized there were multiple colors circling around.  It was a circular object which hovered and moved diagonally, up and down.  My son also thought it was emitting beams which could faintly be seen when the clouds were thinly moving through.  I thought at first maybe it was a helicopter or a drone but realized where we were and how large of an object this would have had to be to be seen at this distance.  Plus there was no noise evidence of a helicopter that might have echoed through the hilly area.   At least two adults and my teenage son witnessed this for about an hour.
