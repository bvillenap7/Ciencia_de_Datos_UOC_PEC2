We could see a pink glow, and we looked up and saw a huge flourescent pink circle about 50 feet above us.  It began to pulsate and we heard a faint humming, and then it flew straight up, did about 3 loops, going higher each time.  Then it paused, it's glow seemed to get brighter, and it just took off at a super fast speed across the sky. Then the truck apparently started up by itself.  Our hair was full of static and the hair on our arms was standing on end...everything seemed to crackle from the static.  We sat for a moment, waiting to see if it would come back, but drove away after a bit.;45.7114;-91.7616
