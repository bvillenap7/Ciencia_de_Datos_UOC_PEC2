Bright stationary changing colors red blue, green and white.  Varied intensity.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a star??  PD));2016-11-06 01:00:00;1 hour;Bright stationary changing colors red blue, green and white.  Varied intensity. After midnight we noticed a very bright object that seemed to fluctuate in intensity and color.  We examined it, sharing 2 binoculars for an hour.  It stayed in the same spot all that time and was still there when we retired.  It changed colors from green blue to white and red, sometimes very bright and clear, sometimes fading. It definitely was not a plane or planet.  Not sure how far away, maybe a couple miles.  The night was very clear.  My wife and I saw it again the next night at the same location in the southeastern sky.  We again studied it with binoculars for half an hour.   I took 2 pictures with my phone that aren't clear but do show the color change.;42.8803;-88.5817

Observers both grew up in the area and are relatively unopinionated/dont really pay attention to ET theory or debate it;42.8803;-88.5817
