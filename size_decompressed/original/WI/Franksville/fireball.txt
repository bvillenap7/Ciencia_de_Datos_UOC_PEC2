She was looking up and to the south and she says &quotdid you see the fi My neighbor drove in the yard and I stepped out on my porch.  She was looking up and to the south and she says did you see the fireball?  My daughter came out onto the porch as another fireball another fireball came over, going south to north.  Daughter says what was that and another fireball came over ,south to north.  They were glimmering, round and soundless and disappeared behind trees on the north in approximately 5 to 6 seconds.  We ran the 40 feet to the edge of the property and they were gone.  They were immediately followed by a jet from Mitchell Field,  which was flying  southwest and made a sharp turn and followed them to the north.  They had made no sound or left no trail of any kind.  What the heck did we see?;42.7858;-87.9878
