My husband stepped outside and called me to come and see what he was looking at. A line of bright lights, some red to orange and some white were traveling from the west to the south above the rooflines of the houses as we looked in that direction.  The front 5 to 6 lights formed a irregular circle followed by the rest in a zig zag line.  We heard no sound even though they seemed close enough to have heard some type of engine, although not close enough to make out any shape other than seeing the light they emitted.  The lights seemed to disappear in the clouds with one white light traveling back toward the northwest for a short period of time.  The entire episode lasted for less than 5 minutes. We have never seen anything like this before. It was somewhat unsettling. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.8693;-91.9265
