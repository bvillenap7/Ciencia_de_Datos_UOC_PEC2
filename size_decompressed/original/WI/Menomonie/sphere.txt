2 Bright lights following each other heading North over Menomonie;2011-10-28 19:18:00;20-30 seconds;2 Bright lights following each other heading North over Menomonie I am not sure if this is where I should go, but I am very curious as to what I had seen. It was October 28, 2011 at 19:18. I was standing on my back door step smoking and looking at the stars like I do every night.  While I was standing there I had seen 2 very bright lights following each other  across the sky. I found it odd because there usually isn't anything  traveling north over my home town.  They were moving quite fast only lasting at the most 30 seconds.  After that time they just disappeared, I could still see the stars in the direction they were heading to but they disappeared in an instant. The time is an approximation as I was outside and didn't see a clock at the time. I would estimate it to be between the times of 19:15 and 19:23 at the earliest and latest.  We do have air traffic over my town but its always east> west or west > east.  I would be very interested in finding out what these lights were.;44.8693;-91.9265
