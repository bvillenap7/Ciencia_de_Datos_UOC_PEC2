Orange Fireball Flies Over Menomonie Wisconsin;2012-06-16 23:30:00;2 minutes approx.;Orange Fireball Flies Over Menomonie Wisconsin Saturday June 16th at about 11:30 - 11:35 pm 4 witnesses saw an orange fireball type of image or craft moving slowly through the sky from west to east.  It was a large object that flew level and did not descend.   The craft/object was silent.  It appeared to be flying lower than a normal airplane.  The orange color and slow moving object caught the eye of one of our house guests and then three other people who were standing outside talking witnessed it as well (myself included).   One man ran to the end of the street so that he could continue to watch it until he finally lost sight of it behind the trees.   It was a hot and humid night and had been raining on and off all day.  At the time this occured, the sky was clear with no rain present.;44.8693;-91.9265
Fluorescent green, glowing, football-sized obeject falling from the sky;2012-06-22 23:30:00;1 minute;Fluorescent green, glowing, football-sized obeject falling from the sky My husband, two boys and I were driving west on Highway 29 from Menomonie on June 22, 2012.  Near 11:30pm, we were approaching the intersection of County Road N when my husband and I saw a spherical green glowing, football-sized object falling from the sky. It clearly was not a falling star, but had many comparable characteristics as one. However, it was much larger, very close to us, glowing a very bright fluorescent green and was shaped like a large football.  We thought it was falling slowly for having been falling for what presumed to be a long distance from the sky. It may have fallen in the marsh area on the south side of 29. Neither of us had ever seen anything like this before.  When researching what this may have been, I was surprised to have found this website containing so many accounts of similar stories near where we experienced this. Could this have been a piece of a meteor?  Or what would you suspect this to be?;44.8693;-91.9265
Large fireball like object floating in the sky during a down pour.;2013-06-11 22:15:00;5 minutes;Large fireball like object floating in the sky during a down pour. Driving home from Eau Claire to Menomonie, Westbound on hwy 94 around 10:15pm.  Started to down pour and I saw a large fire ball like object in the sky.   It stayed in the sky in the same spot for about 5 minutes.   After that it slowly faded away. I have seen objects like this before when I was about 15 years old, except there were many more lights in the sky and it lasted for at least an hour.;44.8693;-91.9265
