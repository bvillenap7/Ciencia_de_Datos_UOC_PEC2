Single red light that did not flash.;2012-09-01 20:15:00;1 minute;Single red light that did not flash. While letting my dog out this evening I happen to look up at the night shy and saw one bright light that moved across the sky fairly fast. I only had a small window to see it, it was between two trees, so i did not get a chance to see it very long. From what I did see the light did not flash, it just stayed steady and was much lower than a plane, maybe the hight of a helicopter.  Also there was no sound as it passed, it was completely silent. I wish I would have thought of calling for my boyfriend to come see it but I was to stunned to even think of it.  All i can say is that it was just bizarre, it did not move like a plain or a helicopter. I normally would not report something like this but like I said it was just so bizarre and this was the first thing that came to mind to do.  I did try to research it some and could not come up with an aircraft that would look like this.;44.3841;-91.3059
