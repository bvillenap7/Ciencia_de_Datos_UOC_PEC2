Strange Formation in Sky Behind Clouds in Cross Plains WI;2019-09-07 18:12:00;20-30 minutes;Strange Formation in Sky Behind Clouds in Cross Plains WI We were coming out of the house to walk downtown to a restaurant and noticed a very unusual looking shape in the sky above our house. We have never seen a formation in the sky like this, nor could we find any like it on the internet.  It appears like there is a spacecraft behind the clouds.  It moved very slow to the south and then suddenly stopped moving and sat stationary.  After taking several photos and video of this strange formation it was gone 30 minutes later.;43.1099;-89.6414
