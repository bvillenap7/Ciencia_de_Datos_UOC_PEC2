Floating metallic disk/almond;2019-02-12 15:15:00;2 minutes;Floating metallic disk/almond I finally go one on camera!!  I was out shoveling the sidewalk of the 11+ inch’s of snow and I stopped to itch my nose. Just then this saucer shaped object “floated “ over.  It did emerge from the clouds. I watch for a while... I was mesmerized, till I released I could record it. I ripped my chunky gloves off and tried to film it.  I have the vid.  I thought It was a plane at first but then maybe a drone for the newspaper about the snow but no. It was silent and a bit erratic. I don’t think it’s a ballon. It was too big ( estimation of the size of a small crop duster of sorts). Planes fly over all the time. There is an airport in town.  Portage WI;43.5500000000001;-89.4737999999999
