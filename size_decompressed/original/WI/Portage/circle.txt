They were large bright Orange.   My Husband and I were heading North toward Coloma.  Finally, I looked over my right shoulder, out my passenger window to the South of the sky,  And that is when I saw the five large Orange Orbs line up with each other,  And then they were gone, not to be seen again.. I have noticed that there are finally other accounts of this night's endeavor.  I have never experienced anything like this before.;43.5500000000001;-89.4737999999999

Driving through portage Wisconsin when we spotted a beam of white light appear from the ground. It shot upwards to tree height, and then made a beam of white light in the form of a circle.Only one was observed and we called the hotline. The speaker thought we were pranking because a female answered the phone then promptly  handed it off to a male. This was because the first person who picked up didn't see the incident. She was on the right side of the car in the back, and the beam of light came from the left side of the vehicle.;43.5500000000001;-89.4737999999999
