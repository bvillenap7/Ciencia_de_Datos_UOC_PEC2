5 Orbs seen over Columbia county;2013-11-15 05:45:00;20 seconds;5 Orbs seen over Columbia county My family and I were driving on I-39 North through Portage when I noticed a small orb that almost looked like a flare but it did not move and stayed stationary for several seconds.   Directly under the first orb a second orb appeared and stayed stationary.   A third orb appeared directly under the first and second orb.   The three orbs disappeared just as a fourth orb appeared directly below the location of the first orbs and disappeared as the fifth orb appeared to the right of the forth orb's location making a 90ยบ angle.   The fifth orb disappeared just like the others.   Several blinking aircraft like lights moved in to the area where the orbs had been and continued travelling the area for a while after.;43.5500000000001;-89.4737999999999
