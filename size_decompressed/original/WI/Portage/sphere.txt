Foo-Fighter  seen from ground around Commercial jetliner in Wisconsin;2003-07-15 13:00:00;3 minutes;Foo-Fighter  seen from ground around Commercial jetliner in Wisconsin It was a very clear July summer day.  I was loading my work truck with tools with my dad.  I happened to look up at the sky and saw a commercial airliner.  I kept watching it because it was so clear I could make out the colors on the jet.   Then I noticed a small shiny orblike thing flying right under the tail of the jet.  The shiny orb was very small compared to the jet.  I called my dad over to show him and to make sure I was seeing it right.  He was amazed by this also.   About 5 seconds later it moved from under the tail of the jet to side of the jet still beside the tail.  Then it moved back under the tail and to the other side of the tail out of sight for a couple seconds and then back under the tail.   The craft moved unlike any type of jet I've ever seen.  It was very fast and precise.  I told some people about the sighting but most say it was probably a fighter jet refueling.  I really don't think this because of the size comparison to the airliner and the precision of the craft.   Then it dropped further under the tail than usual and sped off from under the jet at an incredible speed.  Me and my father agree what I saw was not a refueling jet.  I followed ufology pretty much all my life and I take it quite serious none of this is exagerated.  I'm thinking it could be linked to the foo-fighter sightings made by many pilots.  My dad has also has had many incredible sightings in the past.  I will have him report his soon. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.
