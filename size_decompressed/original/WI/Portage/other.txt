So, still laying down in the bad I was stearing through window on the stars. Several min later  saddenly I sow a  strage object passing the skies from north to south. It looked like two yellowish spheres which were interconnected by unvisible bonds. I immediately woke up my wife screeming Look UFO! And she sow this thing also.She was shocked. I jumped out of my bed and rushed for video camera.I was concerned about the  time and therefore worked quickly . It was pretty cold outside and grass was very wet, inspite I was bearfeeted and shaking I was able to locate the object and pointed the camera on it. Unfortunately comcorder screen blinked once and that showed low battery indicator.I was so upset.Soon object vanished soundless  and I returned back home.Couple days before I was recording my kids on camera and comletely forgot to charge the battery. Rest of the night we could't sleep discussing this event.;43.5500000000001;-89.4737999999999
