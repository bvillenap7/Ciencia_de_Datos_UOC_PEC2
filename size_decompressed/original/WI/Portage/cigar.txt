Gray cigar-shaped object hovering;1971-06-10 15:00:00;2 mins;Gray cigar-shaped object hovering   When I was 10 or 11 years old, my mother was working outside in the yard and called to my brother and I to come outside quickly. We ran outside and my mother pointed to a field approximately 100-150 yards from our house. About 100 yards above the field, there was hovering a very large, cigar-shaped object. It made a deep humming sound. No engine sound.  The object appeared to be spinning around as it hovered. It was dark gray in color. We were fascinated and continued to watch it just hover in the same spot until it suddenly shot up through the sky and disappeared. My mother sent my brother and I to the neighbors houses to see if anyone else had seen it. All the neighbors whose doors I knocked on refused to open their door which was very unusual at that time. Some of them were very frightened and said through the door that they had not seen anything. We never verified that anyone had witnessed it.  Both my mother and I recall this event clearly however my mo! ther to this day insists she was abducted and then set back down.  I only recall standing in front of it and staring at it for some period of time.  Best guess:  couple of minutes but actual time unknown.  Years later I joined the military and served in Army Aviation.  I spent years on military airfields and never saw or heard anything similar.;43.5500000000001;-89.4737999999999
