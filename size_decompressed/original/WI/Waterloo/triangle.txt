((HOAX??))  Triangular shaped UFO spotted in Waterloo wi. Traveling slow then gradually gained speed until we lost it.;2014-05-04 21:30:00;Trailer park;Triangular shaped UFO spotted in Waterloo, WI.  Traveling slow then gradually gained speed until we lost it. My boyfriend was walking me out to my car and saw a weird looking animal on the ground that looked to be a bunny.  While I was looking for this animal I noticed these bright lights in the sky that kind of looked like headlights but it was flying very low and very slow.  I decided to follow it and it gradually became faster and we lost it.  We were on our way back to his house and we saw it again but this time it was lower and looked to be landing.  We started following it until it became so low we lost it behind the trees in between Waterloo and Marshall wi.  The object was triangle shaped with three lights on the back and two headlights on the front.  My boyfriend says he saw two poles sticking up on the back of it.  While I was chasing it my car kept stalling while I was pressing the gas, and my car never does that.   After we got back to his house we saw about 7 to 10 bunnies just chasing one another around the street.;43.1863;-88.9885
