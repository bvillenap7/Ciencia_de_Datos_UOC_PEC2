Electrical failure of my reliable vehicle and some missing time.;1976-10-15 23:00:00;4 hrs;Electrical failure of my reliable vehicle and some missing time. My ex wife and I  were driving from a gig. I thought that I would visit some relatives in Almena, Wisc. and thought I would get there about 9 pm. In actuality I got into town about 1030pm an decided to keep on driving south.It seems to me that I went under a hiway bridge and within 5 mins/5 miles my truck was losing power, lights dimmed, radio lost station, and within 1 min the truck stalled and coasted to a stop. I tried repeatedly to start the vehicle and it was totaly dead, not enough juice for interior lights. I thought we were there for less than an hour . A guy going the other way turnrd around and asked if he could help. He was a wrecker driver just off work at 3 am. Told him the truck was dead. He looked under the hood for a moment and asked me to crank it. It fired right up. I expressed wonder and continued on. To this day I cant explain the trucks failure, or the time discrepency. I would be irate if I had to sit around for 4 hours, yet I felt lucky because I thought the sameritan found us right away. I know it sounds bogus but I am sure of all of these facts.
