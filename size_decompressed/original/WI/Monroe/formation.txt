3 large red lights in souther Wisconsin;2012-08-31 21:00:00;5 minutes;3 large red lights in southern Wisconsin I was inside my home at approximately 9pm when I heard a very low humming sound.  I went outside to investigate and immediately saw 3 large red lights in the sky in a triangle shape or possibly a V formation. The lights were far apart but moving in sync.  I considered if they were airplanes, but no blinking lights. The lights were, in fact, very different from airplane lights. First of all, they were much larger and they had a yellow light around the red light that made them appear rather “cartoon-ish” to me. I was shocked at how obvious these lights were and thought that anyone outside at the time couldn’t miss them. Soon after I started watching the lights, one of them ventured off in another direction away from the others and disappeared.  I stood in my yard and continued to watch the other 2.  After about 3 minutes or so, another of the lights faded away leaving just the leading light. The whole episode lasted about 5 minutes.;42.5951;-89.6322
