Orange ball of light rising above tree line and darting into space.;2018-07-29 01:00:00;5 minutes;Orange ball of light rising above tree line and darting into space We were sitting on the dock at a cabin on the Western side and Southern end of Half Moon Lake.  Across the lake, above the tree line and under the moon, we saw an orange ball rise at the speed of a drone.  We thought it was a drone, until it went higher than any drone could fly. It was about 1/4 the size of the full moon when it rose, much larger than any starts or aircrafts we could see in the sky.Â   When it rose to the height of an airplane, it moved across the sky to the Southern side of the lake.  It stopped moving or slowed down significantly for at least 7 seconds.  It then suddenly and very rapidly moved East towards Mars (which was visible to us and looked like a very bright star).  It moved as if it was shooting off. It then disappeared as if the light had just gone out.;45.4608;-92.4148
