PD);2006-05-04 00:00:00;2 1/2 hours;Red near ground 1 beam light seperate into 4 which rotated and the tops rotated of the beams we were driving from wausau to greenbay on HWY 29 at 12:30 am we left wausau about 1 hour later we saw something hovering over the ground to our north it was glowing red and from it a beam of light shot out and from that 1 beam 4 beams shot out into a circle and they rotated then went back to one beam and the process continued. it was like the beams were signaling something also the object was very low to the ground also note there is no major airports in this area as indicated on a WI map.  there were dead animals along side of the road also in a box shape much like the lights were. i looked on the web and there is no spotlights that are like that after we got past greenbay it faded but it seemed to follow us for 2 hrs before then also both me and my wife were wide awake when we left wausau but after we saw that we both became extremly tired ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising light??
