It was about 12:30 A.M. and I was listening to music on my MP3 and looking out the window.  I was sitting near the window (about one foot away) and facing the window.  All of the sudden I saw a rectangular shaped light fly from directly above my head from the roof to a tree in my backyard.  The light was about six inches wide and nearly one foot long.  The roof was about twelve to fifteen feet tall.  The light moved in a straight line from the roof to the tree (about thirty feet).  It moved about sixty feet in about one second.  I looked up in the tree to see if anything was there.  I did not have a clue what it was.  At first I thought it might have been a white owl or bird although there are not many in my part of the town.  This is because I live in a suburban area.  I did not see the light up in the tree after that.  About fifteen minutes later I saw the same exact light from the same spot zoom into the tree.  Then, unlike the first time I saw the light, this time the light went from one branch over to the next parallel to the ground.  A few seconds after that it went from that branch to a lower branch about two feet beneath it.  From there the light seemed to squiggle down to the ground.  When it hit the ground it immediately bounded twice away from my house and towards the road behind my house.  Each bound was about forty-five feet in length.  Once the light had bounded away from my house it seemed to disappear after it hit the ground on the second time.  It landed in a part of our garden where we had rocks as our landscaping.  I never saw the light resting there and I never saw it move from that spot again.  At this point I was pretty sure that it was not any type of animal that I have ever heard of.;44.9630647058833;-89.686725363696

They were flying in a straight line and when they were about halfway over our heads they spaced out a little further from each other but still kept the straight line formation.  They were going extremely fast as it took less than ten seconds for them to disappear from our line of sight.  They were also completely soundless.;44.9630647058833;-89.686725363696
Snail Speed, Moving Star, Extreemly bright, Wausau's skycams kept going down.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2017-02-12 19:00:00;2+ hours still going;Snail Speed, Moving Star, Extremely bright, Wausau's skycams kept going down,  Someone moved the camera 9:15pm......strange Looked like a star in the sky, but the rays of light coming off of it were much longer and brighter.  Much brighter than the north star.  Was heading west in general direction towards city.  Was moving extremely slowly, 20 minutes to move from behind a tree (it was far up in the sky like a plane, tree is not being used to judge its height). At 20:15 i go to our skycam service near our mall, and right when i get a connection the camera goes down seconds later to pitch black, then 3 dots ... like it is loading, then in top left it says initialzing camera .... it turns on and it quickly being 'moved' by someone, everything out of focus, the camera is panned, then shut off and now it says 'opps there is an error down.........some strange strange shit, go and look at the camera logs if they even exist anymore.......
