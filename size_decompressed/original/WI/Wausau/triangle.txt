10-14 white triangles flying in symmetry with no lights or sound associated with it .;2020-04-19 22:00:00;5 seconds;10-14 white triangles flying in symmetry with no lights or sound associated with it . I was sitting in my hot tub with my wife and I was in mid sentence when a triangular type something caught my eye.  At first I thought it was a flock of birds as it was pretty low, but it was moving way too fast to be birds and the formation of the white triangles was in perfect symmetry.  It flew from east to west over my house.  I assume it was one craft with about 10-14 white triangles on the bottom there were no lights associated with it and no sound that I could hear.  The only reason I could see it was the white triangles were reflecting against the black sky.  My wife had her glasses off so she couldnâ€™t see it.;44.9630647058833;-89.686725363696
