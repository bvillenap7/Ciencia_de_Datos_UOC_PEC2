Suddenly, I noticed five lights in the sky, to my right.  At first, I thought it might be a helicopter, however, I quickly realized it was moving to quickly and without any sound emitting from it.  The object flew from my right, to my left.  After crossing in front of me, over the highway, I saw the outline of a diamond shape with a white light on each corner, and one light in the center.  The lights, were bright enough to make it difficult to see the precise shape of the object, yet the lights didn't produce light beams, as a flashlight does, for example. Once the object crossed my path, it quickly sped up and I lost track of it due to its speed, the tree line, and my focus needing to remain on the road.;44.9630647058833;-89.686725363696
