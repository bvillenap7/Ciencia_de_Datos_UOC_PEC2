These three lights appeared circular, were somewhat hazy and formed a triangle with the shape on top being the brightest. My best recollection is that it was yellowish and the two smaller objects were bluish and reddish. They were clearly too close to be planets or stars. I didn't mention what I was seeing to the driver and 2 other passengers in the back were sleeping. After a few minutes the driver, who had also been watching this event asked me what I thought it was. I acknowledged that I had been watching it and said I really had no idea. We both agreed that it was stationary and close. After a few minutes of watching this together and theorizing what we thought it could be, the bluish and reddish objects simultaneously each moved up, swung up above the yellow object and then appeared to either meet it or enter it. Immediately after this the yellow object headed up at a rate of speed that was stunning and disappeared. It left no trail of light of any kind. The driver and I expressed our amazement to each other, then woke the others to let them know what we had witnessed. They were doubtful but we were 100% sure that what we had seen seemed to defy any explanation we were capable of making.
