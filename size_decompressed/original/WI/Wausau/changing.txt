I saw what I first believed to be either a meteor or a disending sattilite.  But I noticed a form behind the light which was in the shape of a pill or tick tack.  The object then seemed to slow and change either shape or direction.  It then stopped and became a light a bit larger than my thumb nail at arm's lenght . When it disappered it didnt just go away but closed from the outside in  until I could no longer see it.  It traveled (facing east) from my 5 o'clock and stopped and vanished at my 11 o'clock. (south west headed north east.   I have not yet ask any one else in the neighborhood if they say it but will and report if so.;44.9630647058833;-89.686725363696
