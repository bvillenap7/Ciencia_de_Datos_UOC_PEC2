Large string of lights traveling across sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-27 22:30:00;30-45 seconds;Large string of lights traveling across sky Standing outside showing my son constellations, satellites and airplanes at about 10:30pm when an extremely large linear object with 8-9 white lights in a row appeared in the WSW sky.  Over the course of 30-45 seconds we watched it silently move across the night sky ENE. A second later a plane appeared just off the path of the unknown object, the plane dwarfed in size compared to the massive size of whatever it was we seen.  We ran in the house to tell my husband and he said the cat was just screaming like he was stuck.  He ran to help the cat but our cat was at the door screaming for us.  My son is completely freaked out. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));44.9630647058833;-89.686725363696
