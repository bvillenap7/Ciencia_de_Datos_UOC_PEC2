UFO that looked like a very big green shooting star with a red and blue trail.;2001-07-31 23:30:00;15 seconds;UFO that looked like a very big green shooting star with a red and blue trail. Three friends and I snuck into a swimming pool and were swimming and my friend looked in the sky and told us to look and there was what looked like a  shooting star until it turned green with a red and blue trail but it was far too big and close to be a shooting star and it made absolutely no noise at all.  It looked like it was crashing but there wasn't a bang or anything and we only saw it for about fifteen seconds and then we couldn't see it behind the trees.;44.9630647058833;-89.686725363696
