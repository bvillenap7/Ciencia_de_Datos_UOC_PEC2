Orange Light in Holcombe.;2014-09-27 20:30:00;2 minutes;Orange Light in Holcombe I was just watching TV at my uncles cabin when I noticed a bright orange light above the trees. It's was moving N.W. at a steady pace.  I thought it might be one of those small remote control drones, maybe someone just playin around.  However whatever this was it was completely silent and went to far away to be a remote control drone.;45.2517;-91.1361
