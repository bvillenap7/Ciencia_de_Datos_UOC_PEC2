three lights moved in formation in the sky.;2002-04-12 22:30:00;approx 1 minute;three lights moved in formation in the sky. I feel very stupid about this, I am not a UFO buff. At around 10:30 last night at my work place which is located as you leaveSuperior going east towards Ashland WI, I was outside in the large field looking at the first clear night of stars in a long time.   I have to admit that I was kind of wondering if I would see something strange in the sky. Almost directly above my head  I saw three dim, but clear lights, (they appeared to be stars, solid white)  moving across the sky in a triangle pattern. They did not move in a totally even pace but constantly normalized themselves in what appeared sort of like a stuttering action so that they kept in a basic triangle formation.  They continued moving in the same direction for approximately one minute and covered about half of the night sky or a little less.  After the minute or so the first one in formation just kind of shrunk and pinched out of sight and the other two did the same once they reached the point in the sky where the other one had pinched out.  The pattern they had been moving in was one of the three leading the other two which took up flanking positions in the rear.  It was like a triangle being led by one of its points. Two things keep me looking at the skies Ever since fourteen or so I have kind of wondered if I would see something in the sky strange because my friend and I had seen a star, solid white, move across half the sky over about two minutes and then just all of a sudden without stopping it just changed directions and went back the other way across the whole sky.  He and I both witnessed this and we talked about the details again recently. I believe it was that same year, 14,  (i am 24 now) when I had a dream that there was one of those aliens that you always see in movies like 'fire in the sky'.  I had been sleeping in the basement while the rest of my family slept on the second story of our house.  The way the dream went was very strange.  I remember kids were playing with a ball of some sort and then a door to my left opened and one of those aliens was behind it.  The strange thing is that the dream faded away and I was in my basement and one of those things was just standing in the dingy doorway to my basement at the foot of the stairs.  I did not believe I was dreaming at this point.  I tried to hold myself up from my bed, and resolved that I was going to fight this thing.  Then it just went black.  I woke up on my bed with my legs hanging off and my blanket on the ground.  I ran up the stairs and I noticed that the side door lock which went directly to the basement was broken and hanging upside down on the door.  I didn't sleep for a couple weeks after that except sparingly in an armchair. ((name deleted))  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have observed three satellites, possibly the U. S. Navy N. O. S.

This could have been meteorological, however it was extremely large.  He said it looked like something very large, the size of a stadium breaking up on entry into the atmosphere, although it only had one piece, not multiple pieces falling.  This was on sunday the 8th he told me, times listed above are aproximate.  He said he saw this at around dusk describing the 7th of March, the night prior. The interesting things is that this incident was on the local evening news, with reports from as far north as, I think, Ely MN around 60 miles north of superior/duluth.

I set my camcorder in the window in night vision mode fixed with an infrared filter which blocks the visible light ranges.  After aprox;2004-05-20 20:30:00;3 min;I set my camcorder in the window in night vision mode fixed with an infrared filter which blocks the visible light ranges.  After aproximately an hour and a half of taping I happened to pass by the camera and look in the frame at some interesting clouds.  I saw an object descend from the center of the camera view.  It had a tail like a jet at first but the tail disappeared after it reached a certain altitude.  Initially the object was moving south west and when it reached the end of its path (behind a house) it was traveling southeast.  It travelled from aproximately 60 degrees from the horizon to about 10 degrees with the horizon when I lost view of it.  On analyzing the video I see that it makes some eradic motions in the middle of its path.  I have telephone wires in these video frames which show the object is moving and not me.  I have sent a small clip of this video to NUFORC.org.  It is important to note that I attempted to see the object with my naked eye at a few points throughout its path and could not see the object, it was purely in the camera that it showed up in nightshot with an infrared filter.  There was no noise present with the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Video clip indicates and indistinct, small light, moving slowly straight down.  We do not know if the movement is the result of camera movement.  Object could be a satellite, possibly the ISS, but we do not have time, just now, to check the ISS schedule.

Light travels in sky, accelerates and then disappears.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS at 22:10 hrs.  PD));2009-07-11 22:00:00;10:00;Light travels in sky, accelerates and then disappears At approximately 10 pm on a 07/11/09 evening, 3 of us were sitting around the campfire overlooking Dowling lake in Douglas county WI.  We saw what we at first believed to be an aircraft coming from the south, right above the tree line.  We even made the comment that it was about time for the 10:00 flight from Minneapolis to be making an arrival. About five minutes later we notice that the light did not appear to be approaching at the right speed, it was still pretty far out. It was almost like it had been moving ever so slowly.  Shortly after, it seemed to pick up speed and appeared to rise higher into the sky -- then, just seemed to vanish.  It was almost like someone hit a light switch -- it just, went out. Very strange, the three of us talked about it all night! ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS at 22:10 hrs.

Ran around the garage down the street, seen more coming at me from the East they got about 3 to 5 miles away and turned South, some were chasing each other, up and down, slow moving, some faster. Then more came and more clusters of 5 to 7 then 1 to 3 then 1 by 1 by them self’s all in the same pattern following each other. Took video and still photos with my phone. No noise, no red or green light like a plane. I’m a pilot, could not believe what I was seeing. Big balls of light amber only;46.7044999999999;-92.0950000000001
3 strange glowing lights stopped all street lights and followed me home.;2020-07-15 22:00:00;~8 minutes;3 strange glowing lights stopped all street lights and followed me home. I was driving home from my boyfriend's house which is about a 10 minute drive.  About a minute into my drive home, 3 very bright lights come flying over the top of my car and soar through the sky, but were very high up and looked very far away.  The 3 lights then aligned horizontal in the sky, still moving.  The middle light and far right light had a white glow to them, while the far left light had a yellow/orange tint to it.  Suddenly, the 3 lights separated and the far left light, soared all the way to the left and disappeared.  At this point I don’t see any of the 3 lights.  I then am stopped at a stop sign on a kind of main road in my town, but there were no other cars or anyone else around this time of night.  As I’m stopped at the stop sign, all the street lights that line the streets go out as if they all lost power.  They were out for maybe 30 seconds.  I have never seen this happen in my town before. I start driving again and then appear the 2 white glowing ! lights again in the sky.  I drive a few more blocks and I just happen to look to my left, and floating in the sky at the end of the road to my left, is the glowing yellow/orange light from before.  I keep driving and the 2 white lights are still in the sky.  I then need to take a left turn to get home & a car coming the direction towards me on the other side of the road had its headlights & brights on and were so bright I shut my eyes.  When I opened my eyes to make my turn, the lights were gone.;46.7044999999999;-92.0950000000001

We were looking up and we say two moving lit up objects, they were going opposite directions.  One seemed like it was jumping  forward and then disappeared after about 5 forward jumps.  The other going the opposite direction went on for a while longer then disappeared.  We watched outside in our back yard for another 20 minutes. Nothing.  Then we went to our front yard and went on to see 4 more lit objects all going in different directions spaced out about 5-7 minutes apart. 2 of them went a short distance before completely disappearing into thin air.;46.7044999999999;-92.0950000000001
Objected moved from west to east over Lake Superior and disappeared.;2021-07-10 21:20:00;10 seconds;Objected moved from west to east over Lake Superior and disappeared. I was driving over the the Belknap viaduct and looked off to the north towards Duluth and saw a bright light near what locals call the antenna farm and saw a bright light. As I continued over the bridge the light started heading east towards Lake Superior at a high rate of speed before it disappeared.;46.7044999999999;-92.0950000000001
