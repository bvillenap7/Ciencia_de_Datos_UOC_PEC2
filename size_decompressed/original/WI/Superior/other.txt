My Cousin and I had just finished eating dinner and playing a round of Golf.  We were driving on a two lane road that leads back into the east side of our city.  As we turned right at a corner that leads back into the main road, we drove another 100 feet until : on the right side of the road I saw a 8-9 foot figure that was walking back into the edge of the forest located under a street light.  I immediately hit the brakes, unsure of what I saw, my cousin who was in the passenger seat looked as shocked as I was. I yelled “I think that was an alien”  The car came to a stop and my cousin yelled “Go Go Go !”  I sped up and my eyes were tearing up as I couldn’t believe what I had just seen, my cousin said “I thought I was seeing things!” I replied with “No I saw it too!” we drove to our appt which is near by still shocked and startled I immediately called some friends they came and picked me up and drove us  back to the spot where I saw the figure I explained what ha! ppened to them, and when we drove back to the location some brush had looked to be parted where something had walked through it. I made the call to the hotline next where a gentleman told me to make this report and call local authorities which are being called now. The figure stood 8-9 feet tall , had a tall rounded crown shape head, the head was as big as a human abdomen, the figure was somewhat muscular looking, it had big eyes, but not stereotypical alien-like , long legs and it did not seemed started whatsoever.
