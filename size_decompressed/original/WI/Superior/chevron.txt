8-12 purely white chevron shapes flying in a perfect V formation then gone in an instant.;2015-04-14 23:30:00;30-40 seconds;8-12 purely white chevron shapes flying in a perfect V formation then gone in an instant. Approximately 23:30 on the night of April 14th, 2015, my husband, mother-in-law, father-in-law and I were outside having a fire.  I noticed movement in the sky coming from the north/northeast and heading south. For a split second, I thought I was seeing a flock of pure white birds moving in a flying V formation.  Upon further glance, I noticed there was no movement of wings and the formation stayed in a perfect V shape.   This night the moon was covered by clouds, and there was no source of illumination nearby to explain the pure white color.  There were approximately 8-12 objects that were pure bright white in color, which were in the shape of a boomerang or chevron.   The entire formation seemed to be moving very fast, and within a minute of spotting it, it just completely vanished out of sight.  Ten seconds later, my in-laws who were standing 20 feet behind us, noticed it completely vanish out of sight.  This all happened within 30-40 seconds.;46.7044999999999;-92.0950000000001
Large V-Shaped craft flew silently flew over Superior, Wisconsin.;2019-10-19 23:00:00;30 seconds;Large V-Shaped craft flew silently flew over Superior, Wisconsin. At around 11pm on Saturday night I happened to be looking up at the sky when I saw a strange object moving towards me.  It made no sound.  It is hard to estimate the altitude of the object, but my best guess is roughly 2,000-3,000 feet.  It was v shaped, smooth and dark, with dim lights under it.  The object was traveling from the South end of town, then pivoted and traveled east towards Lake Superior.  It was moving fast, covering a large geographical area in less than 30 seconds.  When it changed direction it did not bank like a conventional aircraft.  There was no sound, no FAA lights, and I cannot come up with a logical explanation after much thought.  The dim lights and silent, bizarre movement is something Iâ€™ve never witnessed before.  I am a flying enthusiast and know a considerable amount about aviation, but this perplexes me.;46.7044999999999;-92.0950000000001
