Object appeared to be traveling NNW at an estimated altitude of 500-1000 feet, totally silent with no lights of any kind.   Triangular shape (I estimate size of two 727 commercial jets side by side in width) with 3 large circular pads on the underside.   I was star gazing on my back porch with a pair of 10x50 night vision binoculars under a full moon when object went over.  Object was traveling relatively slow compaired with a military fighter jet (which I have observed in the past).;46.7044999999999;-92.0950000000001
