Than this light did a two movement from right to left and stoped again . These stops and movement's were sharp in angle and in split seconds . Than this green light moved to the east and stoped again . This move took a split second again and it remained there for 12 more minutes . This green speck of a light turned a brilliant dark red and my daughter had the binoculars on it . Than it moved left to right while red and shot off outward and was gone . I told this to my mail man on July 13 2021 and today the fourteenth he told me reports from others made the radio news today . I cannot find a logical cause or reason to explain this away and my children and I are very concerned .;46.7044999999999;-92.0950000000001
