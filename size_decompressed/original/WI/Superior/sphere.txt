Witnessed bright orange object moving in night sky over L.

Its difficult to say but it appeared to be heading away from me as it diminished in size. My first thought was that this object may be one of those floating lanterns...but when I saw it change directions...and color...I'm thinking it wasn't.   I checked my weather app for a wind speed and direction....wind was at 0.  object was moving slowly...I have several photos;46.7044999999999;-92.0950000000001
