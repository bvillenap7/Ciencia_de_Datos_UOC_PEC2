Orange glowing sphere shapes over night sky in Marshall WI 08/27/2013.;2013-08-27 21:10:00;5 minutes;Orange glowing sphere shapes over night sky in Marshall WI 08/27/2013 I saw an orange, round, glowing object moving rapidly from southwest to northeast.  I thought perhaps the high humidity in the air caused an airplane to look this way.  Then I thought perhaps it was an airplane on fire.  Within 45-60 seconds, a second orb appeared behind the first, and I realized it was not a plane, not 2 of them that close together.  The second one followed the exact same path as the first.  They disappeared from sight before crossing over the horizon.  They moved at a much higher rate of speed than airplanes do when I see them flying a similar path. These orbs were perfectly round, and it looked like fire with the glowing orange color.;43.1661;-89.0796
