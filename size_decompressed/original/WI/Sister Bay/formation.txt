5 individual white lights, first two lights one after another, last three lights in a triangle formation;2012-07-05 22:30:00;5 minutes;5 individual white lights, first two lights one after another, last three lights in a triangle formation First saw one &quotlight&quot traveling from the Northeast sky to the south.  Thought it was a plane.  Sixty seconds passed and another light appeared.  Seemed to be following first light.  Still, could not identify blinking light usually found on plane.  All of a sudden, three white lights appeared.  They were flying in a triangle formation.  I knew this was not a commercial plane nor private pilots.  They all disappeared to the south.  The next day I was in a town called Fish Creek.  I was speaking to my step-son about what we saw and a lady said she saw fireballs in the sky the previous night in Fish Creek.  These objects made no noise not any identifying blinking lights as found on planes.  They all travelled at a steady pace.;45.1889;-87.1101
