2 Light UFOs in Door County, Wisconsin.;2017-04-13 21:30:00;2-3 minutes;2 Light UFOs in Door County, Wisconsin. We were walking in my backyard, hatching pokemon go eggs, we often look up, rarely we see something.  First time reporting anything.   Anyway, I looked up facing Northwest when I noticed a light.  Pointed it out, watched it for a moment before it faded out.  At first we assumed it could be a satellite, was the same blueish tint. (could still be)  Sunlight reflects off them sometimes.   We waited, still looking, and saw another one slightly brighter, a bit white, follow in the same path.  We were looking past our shed and saw them appear again, visible between the tree branches.   The smaller light quickly looped around the large light, faded out.  The larger light went back the direction it came, fading out almost instantly.  They were probably over the bay.  Kinda neat. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume a nighttime sighting, and have amended the time above.  We will attempt to contact the witness via e-mail.  PD));45.1889;-87.1101
