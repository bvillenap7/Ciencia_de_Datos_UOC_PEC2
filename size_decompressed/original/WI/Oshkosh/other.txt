Orange lights between Oshkosh outside of Oshkosh.;2014-04-10 21:00:00;~1 hour;Orange lights between Oshkosh outside of Oshkosh My girlfriend and I were heading out to get some ice cream when I happened to catch a glimpse of what I had seen a few months earlier, which were 4 orange colored objects that appeared to hover in place in a semi-arc formation.   We were traveling westward on Hwy 21.  The objects disappeared in descending order from left to right.   We witnessed them 3 times before reaching Culver's, and decided to go to a spot where I had parked before to watch these things.   We waited for around 20-30 minutes until they reappeared again to the west of us.  From where we were it only looked there were 3 orange colored objects.   Again they disappeared in a left to right order, with the exception of the final object growing brighter in color before it too disappeared.   We waited to see if it would happen again but did not see anything else.;44.0061070901039;-88.5476307237812
