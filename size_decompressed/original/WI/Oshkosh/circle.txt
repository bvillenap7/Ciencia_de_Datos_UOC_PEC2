An orange object floated at low level and slow from SSE to NNW.;2012-08-25 20:30:00;2 minutes;An orange object floated at low level and slow from SSE to NNW. An object that I first thought was a “Chinese Lantern” floated from SSE to NNW.  It looked like an orange glow or fire at the base of its circular shape.  My wife and I discussed whether or not it was a hot air balloon but it was faster than what we thought a balloon would travel.  It certainly appeared lower than a satellite or shooting star and slower.;44.0061070901039;-88.5476307237812
Flying disk over Oshkosh Airport during EAA fly-in.;2013-07-30 12:00:00;30 seconds;Flying disk over Oshkosh Airport during EAA fly-in. While sitting outside on the campground of Oshkosh Airport during the EAA fly-in, a skywriter aircraft was flying a few thousand feet above us.  The aircraft was to the south and was writing a welcome message to the airshow participants.  Looking straight up from our position, myself and another person spotted a round, disk object moving west to east. It was flying in a slightly erratic line, that is, the object did make several very fast movements to the north and south.  Each movement could be measured in yards. Actual movement of the disk was less than 200mph when first observed.  By the time we could focus on the disk, it quickly moved to the east and out of our view behind trees.  Altitude and size of the disk would be a guess, but it did appear to be below the scattered cloud layer and lower than the skywriter.  There were at least 2-3 miles separating the two aircraft. I am a former air traffic controller and very familiar with aircraft.  The other person who also spotted the disk is a current captain of a jumbo jet aircraft for a major airline with over 30,000 hours of flight time. To our knowledge, no one else reported or saw the disk and it was well above the flight pattern altitudes at OSH.  As a side note, one other person in our group is a high level manager in the FAA. Though he did not see the disk, he would have heard about it if it had impacted airport operations. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.0061070901039;-88.5476307237812

Orange orbs, hovering across the Wisconsin sky, on Memorial Day weekend, in the dark of a quiet night.;2014-05-26 22:30:00;5 minutes;Orange orbs, hovering across the Wisconsin sky, on Memorial Day weekend, in the dark of a quiet night. The sightings were on Saturday night of Memorial Day weekend.  I was with immediate family members at my parents house.  (My parents and my wife saw this activity)  They've lived in the same Cul-de-Sac for just over twenty years, and have never seen anything like it. The easiest way to describe what we saw with these sightings, is that they were orange and continuous.  Orange Orbs is the definitive term.  It was so surreal, and it was kind of like a cannon shooting off lighted orange cannonballs silently in the dark of the night.  It was one after the other.  I've been an avid researcher of UFO's and the paranormal for about five years and have heard of this activity, this was of the biggest surprises but I've seen them before where I currently live.  After a while, my dad proceeded to the front of the house, and watched them go on for about 30-40 minutes.  I actually have a 25 second video of the incident where I caught two on my iPhone.;44.0061070901039;-88.5476307237812
