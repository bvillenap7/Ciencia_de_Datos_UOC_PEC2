I was watching a plane high in the air spraying a chemtrail. It had passed over me but I continued to watch the trail. Then out of nowhere was a hugh cylinder. It looked like it was falling. My first thought was a large plane was going to crash but then I could see no wings or tail. It fell for about 4 seconds and then it just took off to the south and in 3 seconds it was gone. The top of this craft was white and the bottom a rust color. It had no markings and it was very big. It looked like a cylinder or a cigar. The front and back had rounded corners or edges. The sky was cloudless except for the chemtrails which were spreading into a cloudbank. I have seen many objects or craft before but this one was a surprize right in the middle of the day. There was no sound and I estimated it to be about 3 to 5 thousand feet in the air. I do not know if anyone else saw the object as I was looking up at the chemtrails.;44.0061070901039;-88.5476307237812
