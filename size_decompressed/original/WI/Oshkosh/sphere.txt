It was very black and the sun seemed to reflect off the front every now and then. There was no noise. I observed this from the airport fire station were I am stationed. It was going in a direction that the usual aircraft flight pattern comes from. It looked to be about a quarter mile away when first noticed at 340 degrees. In about 1 minutes time it seemed to be at 270 degrees and about 1 mile away. I had to leave then when a fire run came in. The next day I compared what I had saw to a black huey helicopter. The sphere was very black unlike the huey and might have been up to 10 feet in diameter as it was smaller than the helicopter at a comparable distance.;44.0061070901039;-88.5476307237812
Flying fiery sphere for 2 minutes.;2013-06-08 21:00:00;2 minutes;Flying fiery sphere for 2 minutes. I was with friends at a bonfire last night. A friend looked up into the sky and jumped out of his seat and yelled What the hell is that!?  We all looked up and saw what looked like a flying sphere on fire.  At first we thought a plane was on fire but this moved upward.  It moved slowly.  We watched it for about 2 minutes then it just disappeared.  No sound.;44.0061070901039;-88.5476307237812

I then noticed 5 silver objects off to the south east.  I watched assuming they would also start sky writing but then realized that they didn't have tails and were spherical.   I watched to see them fly very quickly away from the air show, over the lake and disappeared. Event witnessed by myself & 2 children 8 & 11.;44.0061070901039;-88.5476307237812
