7 lights in a shraight line over Oshkosh.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2008-11-17 20:59:00;5 seconds;7 lights in a shraight line over Oshkosh. On November 17th at 8:59 p.m. five witnesses spotted a UFO in the sky.  We were at the intersection of Witzel and Oakwood looking west, when we saw the flying object in the sky. At first there was one bright dot, but then 2 seconds later, sporadically 6 more dots appeared in a slanted line. We then turned left onto Oakwood going towards Mercy Medical Center, and took a right on 9th, going west. We then again saw the exact same formation of dots in the sky. It was me, my mom, and my friend who saw it. But like I said there were five witnesses, my friend was texting his friend, and when he told them what we saw, they said that they saw the exact same thing. In the end there were 5 people who saw the same thing but in 2 different cars. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));44.0061070901039;-88.5476307237812
