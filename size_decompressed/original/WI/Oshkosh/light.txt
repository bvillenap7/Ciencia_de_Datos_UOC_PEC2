SW sky in north Oshkosh by the River at 1:30 am.   Two friends and I were laying down after riding bikes and one said look at that satellite.  It was moving at satellite speed and then 20 seconds after I first saw it.  It was passing an object that was almost 3 times brighter.  Then the brighter object suddenly disappeared as it passed.  Then the satellite object stopped.  Stayed there for 1 hour then I went home.  It was still there.;44.0061070901039;-88.5476307237812

Flashing white lights over Lake Winnebago;2012-09-10 10:40:00;15 minutes;A friend and I were in a boat going down the river towards the lake when we noticed 4 rapidly flashing white lights over Lake Winnebago moving in different directions.  One of the &quotobjects&quot went directly over our heads and we thought it could be a helicopter but it was moving sideways and had something coming off the side of it.  Plus, it wasn't making any noise.  This object and the other three lights then flew over towards Fond du Lac, then across the lake, and then back over towards the mouth of the river. When they were over the mouth of the river the 4 lights then came together to form what looked like one craft/entity with 4 red lights that were not flashing.  As they moved closer, the white flashing lights broke off from the one &quotobject&quot and again went in different directions.  The last we saw the 4 flashing lights they were moving again towards Fond du Lac when they disappeared.  The lights kept separating and going off in differen! t directions to then come back to form what looked like one &quotthing&quot.  There were normal airplanes in the air around the same time that did not have the same light patterns as these objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

Didn't look like a helium balloon with light attached, I've seen that before.  This was different and unique.
