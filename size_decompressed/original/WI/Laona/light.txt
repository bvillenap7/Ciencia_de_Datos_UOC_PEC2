Round, bright, white light that followed us for approx 10 miles(NOT THE MOON);2004-03-19 01:00:00;15 minutes;Round, bright, white light that followed us for approx 10 miles(NOT THE MOON) My husband and I were driving on Hwy 8 across Wisonsin on our way to Marquette, MI. We were driving at 55-60 MPH between Leona, WI and Goodman, WI. I was sitting in the passenger seat and noticed a bright, white, round light to my left that seemed to be keeping up with us like what the Moon seems to do. The bright light was at the tops of the pine trees......it was not a search light because it was too bright and there was not a trail of light like what a search light would have AND we were driving at close to 60 MPH. For a while we thought that maybe it was a stationary light that was shining towards the highway but if it was stationary then why did it keep up with us for about 10 miles??? It no longer kept up with us after about 10 miles...it just started to fall behind until we lost view of it.;45.5541;-88.6697
