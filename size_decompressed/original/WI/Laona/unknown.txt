flashing lights above northeast Wisconsin.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.  PD));2016-10-01 22:00:00;unsure;flashing lights above northeast Wisconsin Possible UFO sighting:  Above Laona in the northeast sky saw an unusual light, thought at first it was a star, but was blinking erratically, then looked through binoculars and there was a pattern of red, green and white blinking lights that were stationary.  Then on the next night the same light appeared further to the north, and as I was observing this light pattern, a plane flew across the sky, so I ruled that out.  Just curious if anyone else is seeing this and also curious as to what this is.  It is definitely not a star, but seems to be at a very high altitude.  I wish I had a telescope to get a better view.
