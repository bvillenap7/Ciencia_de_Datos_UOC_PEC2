Very bright triangular shaped object.  ((anonymous report));2017-05-03 11:15:00;5-10 minutes;Very bright triangular shaped object. I was driving towards Ridgeway, WI, and on the left side of me off the highway, I saw a very bright light.  The object didn't appear to move and there were airplanes in the sky at the time.  I was playing loud music and the object seemed to come towards me very slow.   I slowed the car down and looked up as it flew over me and I saw a triangle shaped object. I look in my rear view mirror and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.0191;-89.9151
