Moved very slowly with out sound.  Moved to the south east direction. Lights did not blink and were on all the time. I have driven this route on the interstate to work for 23 years and never have seen anything remotely resembling a UFO until 12-7-99. Very strange sight and traffic was heavy that night.;43.9838;-90.4732999999999
