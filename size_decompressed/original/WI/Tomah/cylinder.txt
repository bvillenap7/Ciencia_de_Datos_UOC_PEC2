SPACE JUNK Looking E , saw what appeared to be metorite travling N to S. Looking up at about 45 deg. and following the object for about 60 deg left to right  for about 15 sec. Object was about the size a 1/2 dollar could cover at arms lenght. It was white/blue with a small trail behind, the object had a glow around it. At the of the 60 deg it flashed out, then 8 small spheres appeared following the same path as the large object was on. They were brite white and lasted for about 2 sec more, then disappeared completely. The night was very clear, very little light pullution. I think this was Space Junk , I have seen alot of meteorites and a few pieces of junk reentering before, I do know what aircraft look like and what they can &can not do. This is why I beleive it was Space Junk.;43.9838;-90.4732999999999
