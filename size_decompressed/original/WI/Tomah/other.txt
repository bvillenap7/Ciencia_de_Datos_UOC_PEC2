On Thursday night 08/05/99 around 10:30pm my wife,our son and I had just finished preparing for my wifes rummage sale the next morning and as it was such a nice evening we decided to relax outdoors and stargaze for a while. We had watched a number of airliners fly over we assumed they were all out fo the twin cities. We had watched a couple of satallites move across the sky. We had also witnessed what seemed to be a short meteor shower with some leaving very brilliant orange trails behind them. At around 11:15pm or so my wife and son had decided to go inside. I remained outdoors for a little longer just hoping to see more of the show. As I sat looking up at the sky looking southward as we had been I noticed some movement from my left. When I turned to focus on it what I saw is very hard to descibe. It seemed like a patch of the sky had a wavy transparent distortion, somewhat oval shaped and moving within itself. It made no sound at all. There were'nt any blinking lights as I recall. It was like looking through a magnifying glass about 8 to 10 inches away from your eye. I only saw it for about 15 to 20 seconds as it moved in a northwest direction at around a 60 degree angle up from the horizon. The sky was very clear. The temp. was about 70 degrees. I'm 41 years old, I work as a Dept.Manager for a local retail store. My family and I have always enjoyed looking at the night sky. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this. If you or anyone can explain what it was I would be very grateful.;43.9838;-90.4732999999999
