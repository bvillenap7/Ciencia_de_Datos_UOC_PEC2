Red Lights over Geneva Lakes area;2011-07-04 21:40:00;About 5-10mins;Red Lights over Geneva Lakes area My girlfriend, who I will refer to as O, and I were leaving my Father's house and we spotted four bright red lights to the south floating in the sky above the Geneva Lakes area of Wisconsin (Lake Geneva, Elkhorn, Delavan, Williams Bay, Fontana, Walworth).   At first O thought they were fireworks, it is the 4th of July after all, but as we continued to watch them we realized that there was NO WAY they were fireworks.  They were a constant, bright red.  They didn't flicker, they didn't blink or pulse.   I ran into the house to grab my Father and his roommate to see, by the time we got outside there were 9 red lights in the sky.  They weren't moving in any apparent formation.  It is hard to tell how fast they were going since I am not sure how far away they were from us.  But they were moving West at what appeared to be a slow pace (Slower than what commercial airlines or hospital hilos appear to be moving)  As they moved West/Southwest they began to fade slowly, like a ! dimmer switch was being turned down.  As the bulk of them (8) moved west/southwest and faded one broke away from the pack and began moving higher than the rest and started to fade in and out, same dimmer switch analogy.  This lasted about a minute and then it faded.   Soon after a 10th light appeared over the treeline traveling at the same pace as the others but lower in the sky. It dipped back under the treeline and we lost track of it. 10 red lights floating in sky, moving what appeared to be very slowly, no apparent formation, moved independently of on another, 8 faded out slowly, 1 faded in and out and deviated from the direction the others were moving, 1 dipped below the treeline and we lost sight.;42.7009;-88.5461999999999

I reported this sighting about a month ago. Last night, while observing them and trying to video tape them outside, I spoke with a few of my neighbors who informed me that the are lanterns, which are powered by gases, that can be purchased at a local grocery store.;42.7009;-88.5461999999999

Star like lights moving from west to east in straight line, in night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-12-22 18:35:00;15 minutes;Star like lights moving from west to east in straight line, in night sky. At 6:35 PM , while walking my dog in my back yard I often watch the sky.  Tonight I saw something I have never seen before.   Approximately  7 lights in line from the horizon straight up. These lights were much like stars.  No flashing, just like moving bright stars. It was a clear, no moon night sky. Then I realized they were slowly moving.  As they moved the first would disappear but another (nearest the horizon) would appear.  I realized they were actually moving from west to east, but at a very slow speed and high altitude.  So slow that at first I wasnâ€™t sure they were moving.  I called my husband out to see it too.  It lasted a good 15 minutes, until they all disappeared, one by one never veering from course.  We live outside of a small city and can see the night sky.  Also there was no sound from them.;42.7009;-88.5461999999999
