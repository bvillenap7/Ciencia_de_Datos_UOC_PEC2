It is stationary in the eastern part of the sky, but at times moves a little to the west.  There are no towers or airplanes in the area that I see it.  I can step outside my kitchen door and see it almost every night.  It is orange in color and I know it is not a star which is in other areas of the sky.   I do have pictures on my cell phone but do not know how to transmit them.;42.7009;-88.5461999999999
