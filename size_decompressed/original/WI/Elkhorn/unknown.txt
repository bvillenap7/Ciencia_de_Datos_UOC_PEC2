Orange light travels in straight trajectory north over county fair in Wisconsin.;2010-09-05 21:24:00;40 seconds;Orange light travels in straight trajectory north over county fair in Wisconsin. We (myself and two others) were at the Walworth (Wisconsin) County Fair.  We had just sat down facing north to eat our cream puffs, when I spotted an unusual object in the sky.  I pointed it out to my friend and grandson, along with several other fairgoers.  We observed the object flying due north at what I would estimate to be an approximate altitude of 1500 feet.  What caught my eye was the color, orange.  It appeared to have four cone-like downward projections of orange.  My grandson stated he thought perhaps it was a hot-air balloon.  I pointed out that was a good guess, but as it was traveling too fast (about three hundred mph at that altitude) and in a staight, non-wavering line, not to mention at night,  that a balloon was unlikely.  The thought of an aircraft on fire came to mind when I first saw it, but it continued to travel straight and maintain altitude.   It then dawned on me there were no navigational lights what so ever.  The object disappeared! over the visible horizon (fair lights).
