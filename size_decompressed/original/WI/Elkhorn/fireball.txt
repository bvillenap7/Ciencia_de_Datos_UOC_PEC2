Red flickering light heading north from Elkhorn Wisconsin.;2014-08-31 22:15:00;5 minutes;Red flickering light heading north from Elkhorn Wisconsin I was at Lauderdale Lakes, north of Elkhorn at a party.  I notices a red light through the trees flying south to north over Green Lake.  It was very bright in the twilight, and I pointed it out to another person.  We both thought it looked odd but was probably a plane and we assumed that just couldn't see the rest of it through the trees. About 15 minutes later, I was alone on the pier when a second fireball, identical to the first, flew overhead on the same south to north path. It was several thousand feet up.  There was no sound.  The red light flickered like a flare but there were no sparks and it was not falling.  It moved steadily north across the lake at about the speed of an airplane.   My daughter came out and saw it as it headed away and we watched it until it blinked out.;42.7009;-88.5461999999999
