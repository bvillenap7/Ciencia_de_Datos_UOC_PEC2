Light formation in the sky for 30 minutes in Southeastern Wisconsin;2014-11-20 16:35:00;30 minutes;Ligth formation in the sky for 30 mintues in Southeastern Wisconsin Our family was driving in Southeast Wisconsin when we first sighted what appeared to be 8-14 very short airplane trails as the sun was setting….. as we watched,  the “trails” moved but didn’t change shape.  The longer we watched the more we saw eventually nearing 20 of them.   We watched them move from south to west for about 30 minutes.  They were lines of light…some shorter than others.  One much longer than the others.   There were two or three that were vertical and the rest horizontal.   There were 2 adults and 4 kids who all witnessed this at 4:30 in the afternoon.;42.7009;-88.5461999999999
