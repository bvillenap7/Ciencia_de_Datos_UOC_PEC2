It appeared to have 3 flashing lights spaced equally.  I was driving and it kept being blocked by trees but reappeared several times until it completely disappeared.  I got out of my car to find it but it was gone. I was driving home from work and came to a curve in the road.  As I approached the curve I saw this long object in the air.  At first I thought it was the helicopter for the near-by hospital but then I realized that it wasn't any helicopter and wasn't like any kind of plane I have ever heard of.  It was long and had several lights (I think three and I know that the end lights were colored differently)  As I moved I realized that the object was not moving at all.  I on several occasions went by groups of trees that blocked my view but when I got pass them the object was still there.  I came to a corner and turned in the direction of the object to see it better and it was gone. I have to say that this did not look like some kind of alien spacecraft---like I would know (ha!) But it didn't look like a plane or helicopter either.;43.0800290874524;-88.0222823193926
