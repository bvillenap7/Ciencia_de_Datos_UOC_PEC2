I was driving westward on State St. in Wauwatosa when I looked up into the northwestern sky and I saw a bright green fireball falling towards the earth.  It had a completely straight trajectory, rigid almost, and vertical.  It did not flare out it meerly vanished.  It's coloring was bright green.  The size of the object was larger than any star or meteor I have ever seen in picture or in person.  The duration of the event as very brief. There was no trail.;43.0800290874524;-88.0222823193926
