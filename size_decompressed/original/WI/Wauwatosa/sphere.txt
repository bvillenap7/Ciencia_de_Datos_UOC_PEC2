Saw three UFOs in the sky on a clear blue day.;1995-07-28 15:15:00;15 Minutes;Saw three UFOs in the sky on a clear blue day. While driving home with a friend from high school in my senior year I was looking out of the moonroof on a perfectly clear day when something shiny caught my eye.  At first I thought it was just one of those foil birthday balloons that you can get from the grocery store and someone had just let it go. after about 2 minutes of watching it I called it to my friends attention (he was driving) so he started to glance at it while he was driving, then we stopped at a stoplight and he was able to get a full look at it through the moonroof.  We both started to mention that it was definitely strange how it seemed to be following us.  About 7 minutes later I was still watching it when we were just about to arrive at my house (about a city block away) when this one silver thing actually met up with 2 other ones and they began to circle around each other (somewhat like how my sister used to braid her hair).  I then watched these objects for another couple of minutes, I then decided that I had to get my father, so I turned around and took my eyes off of it for a moment and yelled throught the front door to get him to come out and look, I then looked up in the air to continue watching them and they dissappeared.  Please keep in mind that the date I put down for the actual encounter may not be the actual date it ocurred, it was a long time ago and it happened late in the summer of 1995 as I was a senior and it was still warm outside.;43.0800290874524;-88.0222823193926
Orange-Red spheres absent of sound flying through the night sky.;2012-06-10 21:35:00;5 minutes;Orange-Red spheres absent of sound flying through the night sky. Saw a bright orange-red sphere in the eastern sky gliding from south to north aproximately 200 yards off the ground kept a steady pace into the north sky, one appeared from aproximately the same line as prior and did the same thing.  The first one appeared in the western sky relative to our focal point which was maintained throughout the whole incident but lost sight of it the the horizon of nearby trees. Caught it on video, though because it was with a cell phone the quality isn't great none the less it's clearly on video, all three ufos were identical in shape.
