On the very top was something like an antenna with one green light on the tip of it.   This object hummed and just hovered and was motionless.  All of a sudden it just went up and away very rapidly, we haven't a clue as to where it went, it just straight went up.   We called a local airport but they didn't answer their phone, was very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));43.0800290874524;-88.0222823193926
