10-20 Glowing Orange orbs in formation in Milwaukee area.;2014-10-21 19:30:00;1-3 minutes;10-20 Glowing Orange orbs in formation in Milwaukee area. Orange orbs moving from north to southwest direction seemed to be 7-10 K feet above but moving higher and at a high rate of speed.  All moved similar direction but no clear pattern except that the orbs started with 3-5 then about a dozen or more followed by a handful then one orb in the end.  Varied size and some changed color from Orange to red and some seemed to split apart into two pieces and the second piece changing from Orange to red and small change in direction and even slowing down.  These objects had intention and were not falling from sky.;43.0800290874524;-88.0222823193926
