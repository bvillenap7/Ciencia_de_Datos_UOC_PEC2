During late afternoon, I'd go out to the local softball field and sit on a bench and watch the sun set.  This was primarily the summer and early fall of 2012.  I would sit there, facing west, around 5pm, sometimes for a couple hours.   Anyhow, as I'm looking at the afternoon sky, and it was still bright and sunny out, I noticed a very bright light, low in the sky, close to the horizon.  Day after day it was there.  On first blush, I though it was a very bright star- but at 5pm in the afternoon?!  The moon wasn't even out!   As I had the habit of coming out to watch it, it would bob slowly off in the horizon, to the point that it would slowly move down, out of view, (the trees were blocking it from view).  This happened over the course of months. Now as this was going on, I noticed that when after it rained, craft slowly flying through the clouds, slowly lighting up really bright, then dimming.  But they stayed in the clouds.  I could barely make the shape of the craft.  There was several of these craft at any given time (after a rain storm). These two incidents pretty much made up the bulk of what I experienced in 2012 and lasted nearly for a few months (that I noticed).;43.0800290874524;-88.0222823193926

Light in the Sky.;2014-08-07 21:45:00;Unsure;Light in the Sky. I was on my way back to work tonight...about 9:45pm.  I looked up to the sky heading briefly westbound and saw some strange lights in the sky. They were in a vertical circle in the sky..   If I were to guess I'd say about 12 to 16 of them.  Slightly Orange in hue.   No they could not have been stars.  They were definitely in the atmosphere.;43.0800290874524;-88.0222823193926
