Orange fireballs in night sky;2012-09-28 23:00:00;45 seconds;Orange fireballs in night sky We were outside sitting by the fire when my husband saw 2 orange fireball looking objects flying west to east and then flew southwest and faded away.   No sound before or after they came past, but seemed to move formation.  About 15 minutes later 3 more of the exact same thing came through with the exact same flight pattern and moved in formation.   You could only see a blob through the binoculars, but could see everything eLse in the night sky clearly, including the full moon.;43.0800290874524;-88.0222823193926
