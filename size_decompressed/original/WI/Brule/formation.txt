Triangular formation of three lights moving across the sky.;1999-09-05 22:30:00;10 MINS;Triangular formation of three lights moving across the sky. Sitting out by the fire as I always do when I'm up visiting my Mother-in-Law, she lives about 5 or so miles north of town, I saw quite a few satilites, then out of the west I noticed a satilite shoot across the sky, and right behind that was a triangular formation of 3 lights moving across the sky, I sat there quite a while, thinking to myself that I was just seeing things, and that I was just crazy, So I got up and went to get everybody in the house out, We all watched the formation move across the sky, to the east, then watching them disappear one by one until the last one, We saw a bright flash of light that seemed to shoot at the last light before it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe this cluster of three satellites is a U. S. Navy project, designed to increase resolution of objects imaged on the ground.  The same phenomenon was reported to NUFORC during the summer of 1996.   Mr. Terence Dickinson, journalist for the Toronto (Canada) Star newspaper, tracked down what the satellites were in 1996, and we presume they may be related to that same U. S. Navy project.  However, this is only a presumption.));46.5754;-91.5562
