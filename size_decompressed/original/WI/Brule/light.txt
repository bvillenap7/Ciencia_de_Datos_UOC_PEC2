4 Yellow lights that suddenly disappear;2020-01-15 19:50:00;20 seconds;4 Yellow lights that suddenly disappear I was driving back to Duluth MN from Ashland WI. I make this trip almost daily. If you have ever been on this drive during the night you know that the only light comes from the little towns you drive by. I drove past the town of Brule WI, and not a car in sight. I notice an object just above the trees.  It had 4 dark yellow lights and had a glow as if you were approaching a city with a lot of light pollution.  The lights were in place but I could see a black figure that was rotating in the dark. T he object moved across the sky for about 20 seconds, not super speed just slowly moving along, like it was checking out the ground. Then out of no where the figure just disappeared, as if the figure put up a cloaking shield. The winds were about 20MPH on my drive last night. No drone could handle that amount of wind, and no plane would fly that low to the trees. Every hair stood on my body. This was my first UFO sighting, I had speculations before, but now am a firm b! eliever.;46.5754;-91.5562
