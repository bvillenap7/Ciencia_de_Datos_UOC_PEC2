squadrons of orange balls pass over Watertown, WI;2001-04-20 21:00:00;1 hour;squadrons of orange balls pass over Watertown, WI I observed squadrons of orange balls pass over my house during approximately a 1 hour period. They all moved very fast and I believe them to be lower then cloud level. All the sightings lasted 7-8 seconds from them to pass from East to West in the sky. The first group had 12-13 balls in a row that moved apart from each other, then converged into what seemed to be one bigger ball before disappearing. The next groups had 7 or 8, 5, and 3 balls each all in a V formation, traveling in the same direction height, and speed. I managed to snap a picture of one group but the flash went off. They stopped after I took the picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see somewhat similar reports from Rockford, IL, (multiple dates) and from Westville, WI (05MR01).  A television investigative reporter from Milwaukee, WI,  has been investigating these sightings recently.  The digital images sent by this witness are interesting, but ambiguous, we feel, due to low resolution.  PD));43.2479994371482;-88.7177311444659
silver sphere vanished before my eyes;2010-09-04 18:30:00;10 sec;silver sphere vanished before my eyes There was a silver sphere in the sky. we were sitting in the shade of a garage. The object would not have been seen if the building was not blocking out the sun. The object did not move. We observed a small dark cloud pass between the object and ourselves. once behind the cloud or puff of dark smoke (to me,the cloud seemed unnatural)both the cloud and the silver sphere vanished.;43.2479994371482;-88.7177311444659
