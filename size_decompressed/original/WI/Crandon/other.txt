Could not see shape of craft but many blinking erratic lights (white/reddish orange). It was traveling very fast and extremely high (lights blinking faster than a plane and the height and distance covered does not match up with a commercial airplane).  It stopped in the sky for about 1 minute, completely stalled and not moving, lights remained on and not blinking and then went out for about 10 seconds.   The craft started moving again very fast and lights began blinking erratically again.  It started to get too far to see, headed south but quickly turned and headed back in the same direction it came from.  It almost seemed like it did a figure eight but traveled very fast and far within that time.  Eventually we lost sight of it as it started to return to the area that it previously stalled at however this time, slightly lower and unfortunately below our tree line from where we were.  Right around this time, we did see a commercial airplane after it disappeared coming from another direction.  It was much lower and the lights did not appear the same, we could also hear it unlike the UFO.;45.5416;-88.9115999999999
