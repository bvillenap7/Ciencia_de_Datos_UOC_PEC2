((HOAX??  Date is severely flawed.))  Bright, inredibly fast lights over Crandon, Wisconsin;2012-03-29 17:30:00;5-10 seconds;Bright, inredibly fast lights over Crandon, Wisconsin Two bright lights that were initially interpreted as meteors, were seen moving from the South-East to the North-West over Crandon, Wisconsin.  We dismissed them as meteors because there was no tail what soever.  WE dismissed them as any type of aircraft because of the incredible speed.  The two lights moved in formation and went from one end of the horizon to the other in the space of a few seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.  We have no way of contacting the source of the report to confirm date.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
