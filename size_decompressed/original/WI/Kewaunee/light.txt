String of unknown objects over lake Michigan/Kewaunee WI  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-21 21:26:00;21:26-21:52;String of unknown objects over lake Michigan/Kewaunee WI While taking my dog outside at 9:26pm I was passing the time by watching the sky. After a few moments I noticed a light moving rapidly from west to the east. It appeared to be traveling from the west to east at high speed at a 30 degree angle. The bright glowing object disappeared off into the eastern sky and I presumed the show was over. Moments later another identical white light appeared in the western sky and followed the same trajectory as the ufo earlier, following the first craft's path off into the night sky. Lights continued to appear in the same place in the western sky and traveled to the east at a rate of 1 light appearing every 10 seconds. I ran inside after counting the first 10 lights in the sky and convinced my wife to come and confirm what I was seeing.  She witnessed the same phenomena and we watched the lights appear and move on for another 10 minutes, all the while following the same trajectory. We have no idea what we saw. It could have b! een a swarm of ufos or one giant ufo. By 9:52 p.m. the objects had ceased their appearance. Are satellites launched into space from the ground and that is what I witnessed? I don't know but if it was a batch of satellites being launched I am greatly impressed by their precision and number. I attempted to take video but my camera was sadly not able to capture the event.;44.4395;-87.5602
