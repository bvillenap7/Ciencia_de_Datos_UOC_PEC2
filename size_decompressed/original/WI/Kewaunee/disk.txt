One night, in the township of Footbridge WI,(just outside of Kewaunee) a friend of mine and I were planning to go fishing in the Kewaunee River. The spot we picked to go is very dark, no lights from houses or street lights. It's basically a dead end parking lot. We were sitting by our cars talking and it was one of those calm nights where you could hear a dog barking from a mile away.The sky was very very clear, all the stars you could see were visable. Minutes prior a jet had flown over us and it was VERY high up in the air, and we could hear it because it was so calm outside. Not more than 20 minutes later, another flying object came through, only, we never saw anything like it. It had an orange glow underneath and to the sides. This craft was no more than an eighth mile high, and unlike the jet, no sound was coming from it. We were probably 1/2 mile from it and we watched it fly over the trees from the east to the west, slowly for about 2 minutes. My friend had then called his brother on his cellphone and asked him to look outside at it. (His brother lived about 2 miles from there). He was already outside watching it and said he could not tell what it was. The way it would jerk around and how close to the trees it flew. From where my friend and I were sitting, the craft went over the treeline and we couldnt see it anymore. His brother watched and he said half a minute later, it completely vanished. It was disk looking and on the lower half of the disk and very bottom it was orange. Strangest and most fascinating thing I ever saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.
