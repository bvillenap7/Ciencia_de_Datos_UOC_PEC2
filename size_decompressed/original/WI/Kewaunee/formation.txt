Perfectly spaced string of bright lights mid sky over the bay.;2013-12-17 20:00:00;10 minutes;Perfectly spaced string of bright lights mid sky over the bay. My husband and I were driving home from the city into the country and off the drivers side we saw a string of very bright white lights perfectly spaced apart from each other,in mid-sky over the bay.  They looked to be over the tree line because as we drove they would disapear below the tree line then they would come back again but they wear not moving.  They did not move in any way.  Along this route there are houses, poles and lots of trees.  It was also a very clear sky that night.  This is not the first time we have seen them.;44.4395;-87.5602
