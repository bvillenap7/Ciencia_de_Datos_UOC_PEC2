Bright light appear and disappear several times, moving very slow over Cadott, Wisconsin;2008-06-27 23:00:00;5-7 minutes;Bright light appear and disappear several times, moving very slow over Cadott, Wisconsin Seven of us were walking back to our campsite. On the way we seen about 10 - 15 people at another campsite looking up at the sky. A woman at that campsite said there it is again. So, we all stopped and looked up to the sky and seen a bright orange/yellow orb like object moving from north to the south. It was moving very slow then disappeared. About one minute later it appeared again same color, size, moving very slow in the same direction, then disappeared. I have seen satellights moving across the sky before and this was too close to the earth to be one. They were the wrong size and color for a light on a plane or helicopter. I have seen several shooting stars in my life and these moved way too slow for it to be that. It was a clear night no clouds in the sky. I did not ask the woman how long or how many times she and her friends had seen the object because I ran back to my campsite to get my camera. I took two pictures of the object the second time it appeared, but it did not show up in the image. None of us can explain what the object was. It was the weirdest thing we have ever seen in the sky. We were at a concert in middle of a feild. The attendance at this concert was about 70,000 so I am sure we were not the only ones who observed this. In my group of obsevers there was a Teacher, two Veterinarians, Auto Damage Appraiser, Office Clerk, Plumber and a Machinist. I do not know the backgrounds of the other obsevers who brought this object to our attention.;44.9616999999999;-91.1695
