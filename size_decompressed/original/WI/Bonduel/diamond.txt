Me and my friend were heading home from another friends house near hofa Park rd when we noticed a a bright blinking light that was not moving but hovering at about 1500-2000 ft I took a video of it Then started to do circles then it flew over us heading East at a low speed no sound of engine but could hear rushing wind that’s it we decided to chase it for about 10 minutes going about 90-100 mph on average we couldn’t keep up but we could see it almost perfect from about 5 miles away the craft appeared to hover AGAIN it made a 90 degree shift to the right in a second with little to no effort it the decended into a woods off of laney rd by hwy 29 could not find it then as we were heading west towards our home either the same or a different craft appeared heading east again making same crazy movements.  After this happened I went to look at the video it wasn’t in my phone anymore instead was replaced by a photo that said “MOV” some research MOV means military ow! ned vehicle is it possible that they Erased my video? Have photo graphic memory of what I saw it was nothing I have ever seen before ik what I saw wasn’t a drone nor a plane.;44.7019;-88.457
