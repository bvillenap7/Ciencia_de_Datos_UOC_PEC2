Spherical Orange Lights arranged in a Triangle;2015-07-04 22:08:00;5-6 seconds;Spherical Orange Lights arranged in a Triangle On the evening of July 4th, 2015, I spotted an anomalous looking object(s) in the sky just west of Wisconsin Dells WI.  I was driving east in my semi on I-94 came upon the colorful fireworks display the city was putting on that night. As I rounded a bend in the road, I suddenly noticed lights in the sky emerging from the smoky haze generated by the fireworks.  The lights looked like three (3) orange balls arranged in a triangle shape, as if they were the 3 points of an equilateral triangle. At first I thought it might have been a plane because of the airport in nearby Madison.  But then I dismissed the notion because I saw no blinking lights which are the signature markings of such a craft at night.  Then I considered the possibility that it was a drone, but I believe FAA rules currently prohibit the flying of drones at at night without marking lights. The 3 orange globes appeared not to be connected by a structure in anyway, in spite of the overall triangularity of the whole, but it was dark and I couldn't tell.  The haze lent an eerie orange nimbus to whole array.  It was kind of weird the way it just emerged phantom-like from the fireworks haze. The object(s) flew directly west along the interstate, I estimate at maybe 80 to 100 feet overhead above the traffic. I don't know which direction the wind was blowing that night.  But the UFO moved with definite speed and seeming purpose, relative to the fireworks' smoke, which just sort of hung in the air, slowly dissipating. I wish I had gotten a photo with my phone but I was driving and the traffic was heavy. I wonder if anyone else has reported on this particular incident?  It seems that someone else should have seen these lights as many people were out at and about that night.;43.6532;-89.7651999999999
