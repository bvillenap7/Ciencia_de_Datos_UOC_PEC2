6 Rapidly moving lights... then down to 1;2000-02-17 19:35:00;20 minutes;6 Rapidly moving lights... then down to 1 I was driving N on Hwy 16 from Portage to WI Dells when I saw 6 blinking light moving rapidly in every direction. 2 disappeared and the remaining 4 moved in close together and then went N, S, E, W... each moving fast, stopping, moving fast, stopping. 2 more disappeared and the remaining 2 when in opposite directions. I kept watching one while driving and as it was moving east it suddenly disappeared. I know it was not helicopters - they do not move like what I saw and unless it was an experitmental aircraft I saw some UFOs;43.6532;-89.7651999999999
Three sightings of three to four orange round lights in a line that moved in the night sky and then disappeared.;2001-03-19 21:00:00;4 seconds;Three sightings of three to four orange round lights in a line that moved in the night sky and then disappeared. Driving home from a meeting about 9 p.m. I saw about three or four large orange/yellow round lights kind of in a line and also moving or turning on. As I passed, not believing what I saw, I looked back and they were gone. The same night at about the same time another friend saw the same thing higher in the sky but he was six miles west from where I was. Another person saw lights she described in the same way - three large rusty orange round lights, one in front of the other two, that then moved into a straight line and disappeared - her sighting was Mar. 22 about 8:30 p.m. within the same geographic area -- about 20 miles from the other two sightings.;43.6532;-89.7651999999999
We saw 10 or more, very bright, beautifully colored round lights, darting very fast back and forth across the sky.;2003-01-14 19:00:00;1 1/2 hours;We saw 10 or more, very bright, beautifully colored round lights, darting very fast back and forth across the sky. We live in the country where it is very dark so had a good view.  We have not talked to anyone else who saw these objects at this same time.  My husband has seen similar objects before in this same area.  This was my first sighting, and it was the most remarkable, awe inspiring thing I have ever seen and hope to see it again. The objects were very bright lights that seemed to be round and of numerous beautiful colors: pink, blue, yellow, white, purple, green.  They were not all lit at the same time.  One would go off and one or more others would come on.  After the light went off at each sight, we could see small, dim white lights flowting around that area.  Then there would be a break of 5 to 10 minutes and the round, colored objects would appear again in a different spot in the sky.  The most dramatic display was a line of six in a row.  They would take turns going on and off and the most lit at one time was three.  We could see the shadow of those that were off when the others would light.  This went on for maybe 10-20 seconds before they all disappeared.  All would be dark and then it would start over with one or two lighting at one time in a different area. We viewed them from about 19:00-20:00 hours.  Then there was a half hour before we saw two more.  That was the last we saw of them. They seemed to dart around, moving very fast from one location to another. Shortly after we saw the first two or three we also noticed 5 airplanes seeming to be following them.  We saw other planes but they didn't seem to be interested in these objects.  The five planes however seemed to try and stay with or near the objects.  When all the objects disappeared, so did the planes. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) Similar sighting seen and reported on this site by others from Wisconsin I reported this earlier and may have had the date wrong.  I said 1/15/03, but it may have been 1/14/03.  I talked with a neighbor and she saw the same thing we did.  She discribed the colors as amber.  I said they were multi colored.  In talking with my husband we agree with her.  There are at least a couple others from WI that reported this same thing on 1/14.

Five Bright Lights moving over the Wisconsin Dells.;2011-09-03 22:00:00;15;Five Bright Lights moving over the Wisconsin Dells. It was about 10 O'clock in the evening my wife was driving home from work (Reedsburg) when she saw five (5) small bright lights over Wisconsin Dells. She came into the house and dragged me out of the shower. She grabbed me a dressing gown and told me to get in the car. We drove toward the dells, as we did I also saw the lights ( mainly whitish/orange but always a definite red one, all sort of pulsing softly but consistent in brightness) spread out over some distance. We drove to the top of the Hill behind trappers turn golf course. The lights seemed closer. We stopped the car and turned off engine and headlights. They came by us, still some distance away, but it was hard to tell how far, moving slowly in a line. We could not hear any noise. We watched them move across the sky in front of us and they seemed to disappear, one by one, into the clouds. The whole thing took at least 15 minutes. We left the camera at home in our hast to see them. Did anyone else see them?;43.6532;-89.7651999999999
