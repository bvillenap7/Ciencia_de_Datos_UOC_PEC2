Standing in my front yard that night, facing west, I noticed a bright orange oval that resembled a lower-case e.  The object was moving very slowly across the sky, travelling approximately from the north to the south, and in a path that was almost over my street.  I was amazed that it was completely silent.  It's difficult to guess how big the object was or how high, but I would estimate it was about a hundred feet up and maybe 25-50 feet long.  When the object was almost directly overhead, I thought to run back into the house to get my telescope.  When I returned, the object was still moving slowly in the same direction, but was nearing the crest of the hill beside my house.  Before I could find it in the telescope it had disappeared over the hill.  Since it was so long ago, I don't remember the exact date or even the correct year, but the details of the sighting are still vivid in my mind.  Maybe there were other similar sightings that would help place the exact date.;43.1339;-89.7387
