bright star like form moving up and down;2020-10-05 03:10:00;30 minutes;bright star like form moving up and down I was laying in bed and looking out the window at what I thought was a blinking star or airplane with flashing lights. Sometimes the lights would flash blue and/or red. The object suddenly dropped in the sky and slowly rose back to its original position. It was a slow moving object, much slower than an airplane and was in my window for at least 30 minutes moving horizontally through the window area.;42.5409;-88.6058000000001
