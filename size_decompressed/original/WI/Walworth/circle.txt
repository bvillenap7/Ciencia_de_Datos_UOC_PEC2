My name is ((name deleted)), I live in South East Wisconsin, near the Illinois border, and on February 28th, 2000, at approximately 7:20 pm I witnessed five orange circular objects flying extremely fast.  The objects either had orange lights on them, or were orange and glowed.  They were too far away, and moved too fast to be certain. The lights weren't as sharp, or distiguishable as other airplanes in the sky at that time.  They were definately round and clearly visible, but not bright, it seemed.  They were clearly unlike any of the other aircraft or stars in the sky.  They flew in formation: if you were to number them 1-5, top to bottom, you would see 1, 2, 3, and 5 in a diagonal line, spaced evenly apart, and 4 just offset, inbetween 3 and 5 and off to the left.  They retained this formation as they flew from the south west to the north east at incredible speeds.  I witnessed the objects for about 3 seconds, while they sped out of sight.  For the record, I have never seen anything like this before it was the most incredible thing I have ever been witness to.;42.5409;-88.6058000000001
