Large red/orange orb traveling southeast between Milwaukee and Chicago.;2010-01-01 00:40:00;5-7 minutes;Large red/orange orb traveling southeast between Milwaukee and Chicago. Driving in rural area noticed large red/orange orb.  It was the color of fire.  One single light, no flashing lights.  Traveled northwest to southeast.  Hard to guess the size and distance it was away from the ground.  It was a clear night was much larger and brighter than any star in the sky.  I have observed many jets circling O'Hare airport and Mitchell Field.   This orb was much larger and brighter than commerical jet landing lights.  It moved across the sky at a moderate rate.  I was able to exit my vehicle and listen for any mechanical sounds none were heard.  The orb moved across the sky, started to fade and quickly disappeared.  No sign of tail like on a comet or meteor. Nothing like I have every seen before.;42.5409;-88.6058000000001
