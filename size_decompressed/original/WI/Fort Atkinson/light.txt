three lights over Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin at around 21:55;2010-05-02 21:55:00;2 min;three lights over Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin at around 21:55 I went outside to get my cellphone, which I had left in my car.  The first thing I noticed was a small dog across the street that was barking excessively.  Up in the sky I saw odd lights hovering. There were two sets of red and blue lights with a large conical spot light in between. I could not make out the shape of an object around the lights in the dark.  I stared in silence and then it began to creep forward slowly. At that point I ran to my car, grabbed my phone, and called a friend. After I quickly explained it to her I ran to the door of my house and called for my stepdad to come outside being he was the only one awake, losing sight of the object for less than 10 seconds. It was moving a steady pace but seemed extremely slow in comparison to how low the object was in the sky. It also made no noise. It had the motion of a helicopter following a high speed car chase but the lights seem much too far apart to resemble a helicopter, and again it made no sound! .  My stepdad came out,  watched it for maybe 15 seconds, dismissed it as an airplane and went inside.  At that point it was a little past our house and I was losing sight of it so I jumped up on the roof of my car and watched until it disappeared into the tree line.;42.9255;-88.8474000000001
