About 25-30 lights that disconnected at one point then rejoined. My fiance and I were sitting out watching the stars. From the south we saw a Vformation of lights (very high, at first it was difficult to see) they were traveling south.  After a few seconds, one side of the V moved away from the other and moved out front of the others.  After another few seconds, they all moved back into formation and veered north east very quickly.  There was no sound during any of this.   When our 16 year old son came home we told him about it and he then sat uot with us. App. 15 minutes later we all witnessed the same event only this time they came from the west and eventually headed it the same direction as the last.  The total amount of time was around 30 seconds.
