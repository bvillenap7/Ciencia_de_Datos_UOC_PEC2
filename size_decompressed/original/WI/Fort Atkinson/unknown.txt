20 Flying lights disappearing.  ((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-06 22:00:00;7 minutes;20 Flying lights disappearing Saw about 20 crafts flying is a straight line from west to east and then disappear. The crafts had two white lights on the sides of maybe the wings. Except one the two white lights where on the nose and tail and was bigger than the other crafts. I took a picture with my phone but cant really make anything out but the lights.;42.9255;-88.8474000000001
