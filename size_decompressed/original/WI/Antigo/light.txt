3 orange lights over Antigo sky;2011-07-04 21:00:00;20 seconds;3 orange lights over Antigo sky July  4th 2011, I was on the front patio with my uncle listening to the high school fireworks show. ( we could not see it)   We saw and orange light fly past us, it was slow, not very high, not blinking and noiseless. We still thought it must be a plane. About 7 seconds after the first light came a second light, just the same as the first, same speed duration and altitude, also noiseless. The third light came exactly as the the first two, also about 7 seconds after the second light had appeared.  Now I went into the house to get my camera, and after the third light we saw nothing else.;45.1351;-89.1408
