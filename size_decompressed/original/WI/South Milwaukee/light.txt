2 lights that looked like stars following each other.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS orbiting with Space Shuttle.  PD));2007-06-19 21:00:00;10-15 mins;((NUFORC Note:  ISS orbiting with Space Shuttle.  PD)) 2 lights that looked like stars following each other but weren't blinking or moving like planes or satellites do. At about 9:00-9:30 p.m. we saw something very strange in the sky as we came out of our home.  We looked up into the sky & saw 2 bright lights that looked like stars following each other but weren't blinking or moving like planes or satellites do.  There was 1 big light-star in front & 1 small light-star moving directly behind the big one. The lights-stars both moved across the sky until they disappeared just around the busy main street by our home, the park, & Lake Michigan.  We are only about 2 blocks from the park & Lake Michigan.  Both lights-stars just vanished! These 2 bright lights-stars were NOT planes & they weren't satellites. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) A revision to the previous report I made. The following account happened on Tuesday June 19, 2007 at a clear night:  There were no other planes in the sky at the time this event occured. The lights-stars were white & round shaped. They didn’t change colors, blink, or twinkle, & didn’t move in a satellite pattern in the night sky.  At about 9:00-9:30 p.m. we saw something very strange in the sky as we came out of our home. We looked up into the sky over our house & saw 2 bright lights that looked like stars following each other but weren't blinking or moving like planes or satellites do.  There was 1 big light-star in front & 1 small light-star moving directly behind the big one. The were going north east towards the park & Lake Michigan. The lights-stars both moved across the sky until they disappeared just around the busy main street by our home, the park, & Lake Michigan. We are only about 2 blocks from the park & Lake Michigan. Both lights-stars just vanished! These 2 bright lights-stars were NOT planes & they weren't satellites.;42.9134999999998;-87.8556000000006
Aircraft swoops down right behind a meteorite , then flys up away at an amazingly fast speed. flying in a up and down motion.;2011-08-01 21:00:00;7 seconds;aircraft swoops down right behind a meteorite , then flys up away at an amazingly fast speed. flying in a up and down motion. I was outside smoking, and I seen a meteorite, it went so quick, like they always do, then RIGHT after the meteor shot out, a small light that looked as small as stars look, came following RIGHT behind the meteor. It swooped down into the atmosphere than starting flying up to the right in such a weird way, it was bobbing up and down as it was flying away. I have never seen anything fly like that. It was so high up nd appeared to move so fast.  It traveled back up so high it disappeared into the atmosphere. It was as if the craft was hitching a ride on the meteor then separated from it right as it entered out Earth. The meteor appeared then not even a second later this craft came swooping right where the meteor had came down from.  The flight was so weird i cant describe it good enough. Thats really what gave me chills was how it flew.  How it was bobbing up and down as it flew away, up and down up and down as its flying so quickly.  I called the local police tha! t night and left a report on a few ufo websites. I never got any replies.  I wish i would have found this website sooner, i got a reply right away from you guys.  I really hope someone else seen this too. It was last year nd i dont kno the exact date. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My dad and brother were outside smoking a cigarette, and they seen this big green light descending at a 45 degree angle to the right side of the sky.  It had a whoosing sound.  My dad said it looked like an airplane on fire going down, the light never burnt out,it just went out of view.  This lasted for a good 4 to 5 long seconds before losing sight of it.  They said it had a long trail of white nd reddish light, but the craft itself was glowing green.  They were extremely startled. My dad said it was the coolest thing he had ever seen in his life. We really want to know what this was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.9134999999998;-87.8556000000006
