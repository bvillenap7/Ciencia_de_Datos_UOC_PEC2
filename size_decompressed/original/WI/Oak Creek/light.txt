Unusual star like objects.;2015-09-17 05:15:00;2 minutes;Unusual star like objects. I was outside viewing the morning sky.  Brilliant Venus hung low in the Eastern sky and Orion was in the southeast.  As I looked to the North I noticed two stationary points of light that looked like bright stars.  They were at an approximate angle of 70 degrees, separated by several arc minutes in a north/south orientation.   I immediately knew that this was unusual as they were out of place in this area of the sky.  They held a steady glow with no signs of any type of navigation lights.  After a little over a minute they both faded out almost simultaneously.  I thought that I was still able to see the now extremely dim lights slowly move off in an easterly direction.;42.8895000000001;-87.9074
