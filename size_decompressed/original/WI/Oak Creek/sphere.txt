I have video if anyone wants to see it. the video is on my phone and to big to send and dont know how to download it to a computer.   this happened on may 22 2012.  Then, last night, June 12th, 2012, again the same thing. except this time it was darker and they looked like lights.  last night looked more like a meteor shower until one of them just floated across the sky very slowly. it was a white light just traveling across the north sky from west to east. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a hoax.  Contact information is flawed.  Date is flawed.  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));42.8895000000001;-87.9074
Two red orange fireballs fly low over neighborhood.;2015-08-01 21:30:00;10 minutes;Two red orange fireballs fly low over neighborhood I was in my family room on the couch and saw a deep reddish orange light in the distance.   I shouted at my wife, jumped up, grabbed my new phone, and ran outside.  I saw a beautiful deep-red, orange vehicle coming from the east, then headed northwest.  It was flying low over houses only 50 feet up max.   The vehicle came into a clearing in front of my house and i snapped a picture.  Vehicle then stopped and observed my wife and I.  I was then trying full video.  Vehicle then proceeded straight north until out of sight.   All excited, my wife and I were talking, and I said look for more.   We then sighted another of the same type and description.  This one kept going following the other one. No Sound.  Vehicle consistent with other videos on u tube.;42.8895000000001;-87.9074
