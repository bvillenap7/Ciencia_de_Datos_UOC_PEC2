A dark silhouette of a triangle flew over my head silently.;2002-06-15 00:30:00;3 seconds;A dark silhouette of a triangle flew over my head silently. I am an amateur astronomer. I was looking up at the sky while relaxing after an observation session on my back deck.   After about 15 minutes I was startled by a dark silhouette of an elongated triangle against the light polluted night sky fly over my head.  It was completely silent, nothing more than a black outline of an elongated triangle with no lights.  It blocked out the light of the stars overhead.  The whole incident occurred in a few seconds. It was no more than a hundred feet above the ground. It seemed about the size of my house.  My guess on size is that the short base (tail) of the triangle was about 30 feet.  The two long sides of the triangle about 50 feet.  I was only able to watch it for a few seconds. My rough estimate of speed was about 70 - 100 mph. I live near the airport so I see aircraft, lights, etc. everyday but nothing ever like this. For What It Is Worth: I wish I had known of a UFO Reporting Center at the time of the sighting. I recently saw a reference to your site on a National Geographic UFO special. That is the reason I am sending the report to you now.

On two occasions I saw a craft that everyone tells me doesn't exist.;2002-11-11 20:30:00;3 min;On two occasions I saw a craft that everyone tells me doesn't exist. I work at a coal fired power plant, I was outside (smoking a ciggarette) looking toward the coal pile and noticed two bright lights heading toward me. The craft was moving very slowly, it took about 1 1/2 -2 minutes to cover the distance of the coal pile kitty corner. This is ruffly the distance of 2 football fields I guess. I watched it, trying to figure out why a plane would fly so low or close to the buildings. As it reached the coal belt tubes I could see it had two huge flood lights on the front. It then banked off to the west and I could see the shape. It reminded me of the stealth bombers. It also had three smaller white lights underneath it. I later described the craft to a co-worker who has military experience and asked him what sort of craft it was. One other thing that is probably important. I never heard any sound from the craft except possibly a very soft high pitched whine at he edge of my hearing but I wasn't sure if it was from the craft or the plant behind me. I thought the craft. in a blink it was gone. Anyway, my co-worker said no such craft exist as we know it. A stealth bomber is niether slow nor quiet. A hareier (?) jet would be the only thing that could fly that slow and they are not quiet either. He said either I had good drugs, which I don't, or it was a UFO. I don't know. Only know I saw but didn't hear. This was not the first time I saw this craft or one just like it. On sept 11, 2001, yes, the day the towers were hit, thats why I remember, I went to the store in the evening, probably around 21:00 hrs and on my way home saw the same type of craft coming toward me just above the trees. It too, was moving very slow and not making any noise. I put my head out the window and looked up the craft. it was almost directly above me, I felt I could have reached out and touched it. I watched it for a while, it continued as it was for a few minutes then took off. As it was heading in the general direction of Mitchel field where there is an air force base, I assumed it was a stealth bombe! r called out because of the events of the day. Until I talked to my co-worker about the latest episode I was unaware of the actual flight limitations of the stealth and that 'stealth' does not mean slow and quite but un-detectable by radar. So I don't know what I saw. Maybe you do. ((ADDENDUM TO REPORT ABOVE)) correction to previously filed report. I was able to determine the correct date for a report filed for 11/06/02, The correct date is 11/11/02. I found this by asking a co-worker about a job we had worked on and looking back in our log book to find what day that job happened. ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date here to 11NO023.

Three triangle lights plus one separate light;2011-08-17 20:45:00;21:00;Three triangle lights plus one separate light While sitting in the cab of a truck we saw a triangle of blinking lights in the sky above the tree lines.   Then as we turned our heads in the opposite direction another non blinking light moving across the sky above the church.  This solitary light was moving in a slant across the sky.;42.8895000000001;-87.9074
