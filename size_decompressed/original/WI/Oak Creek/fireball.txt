Two fireballs flying in tandem.;2010-07-02 22:00:00;5 minutes;Two fireballs flying in tandem. Two bright red balls flying in tandem were sighted ~ 20 south of Milwaukee, WI (Racine).  They flew to the north along the shore of Lake Michigan.   As they neared the Milwaukee Airport, the two craft went directly east at a very high rate of speed and disappeared over the lake. There was no engine noise.  There were no airplane or helicopter lights.  They were flying at a few thousand feet.   We live 9 miles directly south of the Milwaukee airport and see hundreds of planes per day and night.  These were not planes or helicopters.   They should have been detected by MKE radar. Witnesses included an mechanical engineer, a police officer (ret.), a general manager of a chemical plant and a sales manager of a software company and 4 children ages 7 to 11.;42.8895000000001;-87.9074
