white rod shaped object flying lower than small plane viewed by one person during outdoor graduation ceremony;2000-05-20 14:27:00;5 to 10 sec.;white rod shaped object flying lower than small plane viewed by one person during outdoor graduation ceremony I was sitting in a bleachers viewing an outdoor graduation ceremony. I heard an airplane noise coming from behind me (I sat facing directly west). After scanning the skies briefly and seeing no plane, my eyes fell upon a long, white or light silver colored object gliding quickly, steadily from northwest to south east. I probably watched it for 10, maybe even 15 seconds. It seemed to fade in and out of visibility, but would always be where it should have been on a regular path. It did not reappear where it had disappeared. Then a small plane did fly over, and the object disappeared for good, but it was clear that the object was lower than the plane. It was a light sunny day, few clouds. It was clear that the object had been traveling faster than the airplane (some sort of small plane) was. I did not point this out to anyone in the crowd, and evidently i was the only one who noticed. The object left no contrail.;43.5056;-90.657
