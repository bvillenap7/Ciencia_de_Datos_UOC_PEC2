There were several amber lights in a row.  It appeared to be 2 separate objects because of the distance apart.  The lights went on and off in some sore of pattern.  I watched as I was driving and the lights continued going on and off in a pattern of sorts.  I slowed way down (I was only going about 30mph just after an exit ramp) to look closer and the lights just went out.;44.3476000000001;-89.1116000000002
Bright pinkish orange lights in a tight line formation;2016-11-14 17:00:00;10 seconds;Bright pinkish orange lights in a tight line formation. My friend and I were up on the tallest hill in Waupaca behind Kmart waiting to see the supermoon.  The sun was just starting to set and we could see the first bright star had appeared.  After a couple of minutes, my friend pointed out a formation of three bright pinkish, orangish lights.  The lights did not appear to be evenly spaced from each other, but they were in a short line formation.  The lights seemed very high in the sky and they were near the first star we spotted.;44.3476000000001;-89.1116000000002
Five or six white lights arranged horizontal appeared and vanished.;2017-12-07 16:55:00;7 seconds;Five or six white lights arranged horizontal appeared and vanished. Driving southbound on a two-lane rural highway at dusk with my teenage son when we both noticed 5 or 6 white sparkling white lights in a horizontal line.  They faded out after a few seconds.   Unsure if they reappeared, as we were driving and could not stop to watch.  Did see them disappear before we passed under.   Not a cloud in the sky the oddest thing we both have ever seen.;44.3476000000001;-89.1116000000002
