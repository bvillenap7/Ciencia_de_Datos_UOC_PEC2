I am a route driver, and was traveling from Weyauwega, WI to Waupaca, WI, on Hwy 10 east on 8-7-2018 at approximately 10:00 am, when I saw the same craft---silver capsule shaped, low to the horizon.  I saw it going south to north at a slow (aircraft-type) speed.  I was driving next to the airport at the time.  It was heading in the direction of no other airport.  As I pulled over at the next exit to take pictures, it was gone!!!  My personal impression, is that it was the Goodyear Blimp passing through to Ohio for another golf tourney.  That's what it looked like to me. I don't like that our times and dates for the sighting do not match.????;44.3476000000001;-89.1116000000002
