Lights turning on in sequence, disappearing at once;2006-03-05 17:30:00;3 minutes;Lights turning on in sequence, disappearing at once The reason I write this is because there is a report on your site from Marshfield, Wisconsin (11/2/2005) that describes exactly what I observed.   Right at sunset, while driving home I noticed a bright star wink on in my windshield at about 45 degrees.  As I looked at it, in sequence about 5 more of these stars winked on extending in a line towards my direction, with the final one almost 90 degrees up over my head.   After about 10 seconds they ALL went off at the same instant.  Not faded, but disappeared instantly.   I have seen military flares in the area in the past, but they are generally an orange airburst type that is not a point of light and fades slowly.  These were simply like a bright gold colored star.   Unlike the Marshfield sighting I did not see any aircraft in the aread afterward.   The sky was at twilight, a very dark blue but not dark.;44.3476000000001;-89.1116000000002
