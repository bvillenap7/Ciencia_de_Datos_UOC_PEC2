5 yellowish glowing cylinders in Dimond formation, one leading.;2017-02-18 21:47:00;6 seconds;5 yellowish glowing cylinders in Dimond formation, one leading. Noticed 5 cylindrical objects flying low and fast.  Maybe 200 ft. up. 4 in a Dimond pattern with one more leading. Traveling north.  Only visible from directly under. Low white, yellowish, brownish light from inside cylinders.  Couldn't tell if all were connected or 5 separate vessels.  Complete silence.  Once it went over us and traveled a bit, seems the angle was right to see the light inside the cylinders anymore and seemingly dissappeared. Estimated speed 200 yd./6 sec.
