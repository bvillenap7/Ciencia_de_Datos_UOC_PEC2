5 orange/red orbs moving in a parallel line for 6 minutes and they disappeared.;2014-05-31 22:00:00;6 minutes;5 orange/red orbs moving in a parallel line for 6 minutes and they disappeared 5 Orange/Red orbs/fireballs in a parallel line with the last one trailing behind.  The last caught up to the 4 other orbs and they disappeared.   I would estimate they were 5-10 thousand feet high and about a half mile away from our location.  Total time we observed was about 6 minutes.   The orbs looked to be about the size of an average house.;43.4242142857147;-88.1873605174348
