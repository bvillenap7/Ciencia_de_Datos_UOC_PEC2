As we drove, I had noticed a light high up in the sky, a few miles away.  It was a beautiful white light, with hues of green and red around the edges.  At first I thought it was a star, and I pointed it out to my mother.  The sky was very clear, and it was a cold night.  There didn't seem to be many cars on the road as we drove home.  When I looked up again, I noticed that the object had moved some distance ahead of us.  Keeping my eye on it, we turned down another road.  The object slowly moved from left to right, then flew behind us, and then in front of us.  It seemed to follow us like this all the way home.  It flew very smoothly, yet seemed to be able to travel many miles relatively quickly.  Later that night as we were watching the nightly news, they reported that many others, including a police officer reported seeing the same mysterious object in the sky.;43.4242142857147;-88.1873605174348
Four circular UFO's, one glowing orange, over West Bend, WI 4-20-2008;2008-04-20 21:30:00;10 min.;Four circular UFO's, one glowing orange, over West Bend, WI 4-20-2008 My daughter was out on our balcony cooling off and called me out to show me an odd hole in the sky. It was around 9:30 p.m. and the sky was mostly dark and cloudy. This specific hole, or clearing, in the sky was bright blue. A few seconds later, I saw a flicker of an orange color in that area. We kept watching, and suddenly another flash of orange glowed, much brighter and more clear,as if closer to us. It traveled slightly before going back out, or quickly disappearing. We saw a flicker again as if it were further away.  Then several minutes later my daughter saw four white glowing circular crafts moving quickly together. She got it on her cell phone video, approximately 15 seconds worth of footage. I studied the film carefully and noted that the larger one first zipped by in a straight line and flew behind the clouds, then suddenly returned back into view, moved in a circle, as if waiting for the three smaller crafts that then came into view. The first two flew together in a diagonal line, then stopped as one did a few circles and the other hovered around quickly in odd angles. Then, the fourth craft came into view, appearing to be the smallest. Once the fourth one was in site, the first craft zipped back into the clouds and the others seemed followed and just disappeared. I was going to make an anonymous call but was too embarrassed.  After hearing about the World News Report, I figured it was my duty to report this as others may have been afraid to report that day too.;43.4242142857147;-88.1873605174348
