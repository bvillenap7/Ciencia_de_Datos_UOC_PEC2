Military or Extraterrestrial?;2005-08-01 21:00:00;5 minutes;Military or Extraterrestrial? The object was coming from the south going north in at a slow rate.  At first I thought it was a helicopter before it was so bright.  As it went directly over head I noticed that it did not make any sound.  The object was triangular in shape and was the whole object was intensly bright white with a red light underneath.  The red light did not blink.  The red light was located closer to the front of the triangle but not at the tip.  It was incredible.  I didn't tell anyone because I figured no one would believe me anyway.  I know what I saw, I just don't know if it was military or extraterrestrial.  I have encountered a couple of sightings in the past. For example a white ball of light hovering in the distance and then disappearing, but I never thought much of it.  But this particular triangular sighting was different because it past right over head. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was riding in my friends car along with two other friends.  We were on our way home when I saw a bright light that, to me, looked like a street light.  But as we drove along the turn, I noticed that it was not a street light.  The light appeared to be going higher then when I first saw it.  The light looked like a triangle with three glowing orange lights.  The object did not have any strobes and did not move in a consistent pattern.  It was approximately 100 feet in the air when I first saw it, and then rose about another 200 or so feet up.  By this time, everyone else in the car saw it as well and we all got out of the car.  Then light then appeared to hover still for a few seconds and then started moving south-east.  We then decided to follow it and it seemed to be moving in circles until we came to a parking lot on top of a hill. 	When we got out of the car again we watched it continue south-east and for about ten minuets.  It then appeared to stop moving and was about 3-5 miles away.  It then stopped moving and then faded away to nothing.  After it faded we watched for another five minuets and didnâ€™t see anything. 	Then on the way home from my friends, we saw it again about 10 miles west from where it was.  This time, it did not move and instantly faded away without any trails and with out it dropping in height.;43.4242142857147;-88.1873605174348

On this craft there were orange/red lights that appeared in the 3 corners of it along with 3 of the same colored lights that seemed to be in formation below almost like a kite tail.  Near the very bottom was a blue light that seemed out of place in comparison to the others.  They did not move, but hovered while we drove by.
