Light brighter than star moving slowly in various directions and dimming out to blueish glow and back to bright light. ((Venus));2004-07-22 03:00:00;2 hours;Light brighter than star moving slowly in various directions and dimming out to blueish glow and back to bright light. I was sitting around a campfire with my friends at about 3 am. I just gazed up into the sky and started looking around when I noticed a really really bright star just over the tree line. I pointed it out and we watched it for about a minute, then it started moving. It moved slowly to the left, then back to the right. It went diagonally in all directions and once did a circle. It stayed in the same general area for about 2 hours, then when it left it would curve up to the right, then up to the left, etc. until it finally curved up to the right and disappeared. When it was floating around it would be a really bright white light, then dim down to a blueish glow, then back to a really bright white light. Occasionally the bright white light would disappear and through binoculars you could see 4 lights, green, white, blue, and red. Once it emitted a white beam upwards from the white light.
