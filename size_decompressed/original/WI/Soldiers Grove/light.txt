20-30 flying objects with lights of different colors all traveling to same spot, slowing down and disappearing in same place.;2001-08-19 22:15:00;? 45 minutes;20-30 flying objects with lights of different colors all traveling to same spot, slowing down and disappearing in same place. It started off with a huge flash we now know was an Iridium flash (east of our place).  Then my friend saw a beam of light in the sky (which I didn't see).  The first craft appeared right where the iridium flash disappeared.  It looked like a disc with flashing lights of blue, violet, red, green white.  All of these light colors were on each of these ships.  There looked like one light of each color on each of these, but they mostly flashed two at a time. This craft was hovering there, sitting in one spot but sort of moving back and forth just a bit.  Then it shot off to the west very quickly.  It took about two seconds to cross the sky and disappear. Then from the west (not from one particular spot) more came, 1 or 2 at a time.  They looked just like the first one, 20-30 total (I wasn't counting so I am unsure of this).  They traveled at the same speed to the east to the spot where the iridium flash had been.  They each started to slow down right before they got to this spot, almost to a stop.  It slowly went behind the tree (I could see it through the leaves) and right when it came out from behind the tree they disappeared.  Two airplanes did fly over right after it ended, and they weren't anything like the crafts.  I'm not sure if they were chasing them or not.
