white/green ball with trailing tail and falling debris -slow moving;1998-06-01 22:00:00;5 sec.;white/green ball with trailing tail and falling debris -slow moving I have been a MUFON Investigator, and am an Electrical Eng. and Sailor of Lake Superior with 30 years experience. Ball of light at approximately 2,000ft. (under clouds). It moved at a percieved rate of about 1 inch/sec. as I saw it. White ball turning greenish towards end. It had a long thin trail, but the curious thing was that it dropped debris as it flew by. This debris was a constant curtain of burning material that decreased to the rear of the ball. There was no sound. It appeared that the object was a low-mass object..it's speed did not seem right for the size etc. After a 5 sec. period, it simply blinked out..and the falling material actually continued for less than a second after it blinked out.;46.8343;-90.8231
