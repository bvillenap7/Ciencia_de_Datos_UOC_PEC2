Strobing orange craft changes position instantaneously.;2008-07-23 22:00:00;20 minutes;Strobing orange craft changes position instantaneously. Object first appeared in the northwest as viewed from the South Shore of Lake Superior. It seemed to be over the lake, or perhaps near the north shore (15-20 miles.)  First we saw a short, horizontal bar of orange light which flashed, or strobed in a stationary position, then radically skipped up about five degrees above its previous position...there was no continuity of movement...object seemed to disappear then reappear the same instant at a higher altitude.  It duplicated this maneuver several times, then we saw nothing for ten to fifteen minutes.  When object reappeared (assuming it was the same object), it appeared to be 2x closer, apparently over the middle of the lake.  This time the light pulsed on more gradually, and showed three or four lights along a horizontal elliptical pattern, suggestive of a round or disk shaped craft.  The lights were the same color and shone brightly for several seconds, then faded.  No sounds accompanied the display.  About ten minutes after that, a very dim jet aircraft traveling from north to south moved directly overhead (jet aircraft sounds heard).  Immediately after it moved to the south, a more piercing white light appeared behind it, then moved steadilyand silently off to the east.  Very eerie stuff.  Object was seen by three adults while cooking out on the shore all saw the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
