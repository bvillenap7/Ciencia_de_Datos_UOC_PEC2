I was the first to witness overhead 2 distinct blinks each lasting only 4-5 seconds.  The blinks were about 6 inches apart at arms length and were a bit brighter than Venus.  10 minutes later my spouse spotted the same thing and pointed it out and I saw as well.  This happened 4-5 times over the next hour.  Only 2 blinks and gone.  Then to reappear in a different area of the sky.  Too short for an iridium flare and certainly not an aircraft as we know it.  Also not a satellite. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.7491739420934;-87.7341541202679
