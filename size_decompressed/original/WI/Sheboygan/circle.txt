A USO under the water that seemed to move very slowly.;2012-03-09 21:00:00;30 min;A USO under the water that seemed to move very slowly. Me and two other people were at the beach and for half an hour stared at a submerged object that seemed to be very far away, but also very large.  It was a formation of lights in a circular shape that appeared to be a part of a dome or saucer-shaped object.;43.7491739420934;-87.7341541202679
Slow moving red, round, object in the night sky over Sheboygan, Wisconsin.;2012-08-10 20:30:00;1 minute;Slow moving red, round, object in the night sky over Sheboygan, Wisconsin. On August 10, 2012, around 8:30 P.M., traveling north to south with a slight west bank, over Sheboygan Wisconsin, I noticed a round, red object traveling at the speed of a small airplane traveling overhead.  I can’t judge airspeed. It traveled smoothly, meaning it did not deviate up or down, or side to side while we watched it. It appeared to have a small flame like that of a helium balloon underneath, but no visible gondola. The red color seemed to glow from the inside of the object. There was no sound. I think it might have been between 200 and 400 feet up, though I'm not sure because I really don’t know how to judge heights. It didn't appear to be large.  The object appeared to have been ten to fifteen feet in diameter. I called the local airport and was told there was no hot air balloon reported at that time, or any round air vehicle.  It is a small, county airport and does not record aircraft landings and take-offs. Because I was wondering if it could have been a weather balloon, I e-mailed Ron Jones, Web Manager at NOAA’s National Weather Service in Silver Spring, Maryland, about the sighting.  He replied that is was not likely to be a weather balloon. I and one other witness are retired teachers, the third witness is a married, employed mother of three. Thank you for giving me this venue to record the sighting viewed by myself and two other friends.;43.7491739420934;-87.7341541202679
Whitish/very light blue sphere falling from the sky;2014-10-06 21:05:00;seconds;Whitish/very light blue sphere falling from the sky. I let my dog out and from my back deck I saw a rather large object traveling northwest in the sky.   It looked like it fell from the sky - like dropping a ball from your hand to the ground.  This was very much like a meteor sighting but the object was much larger and could be seen clearly (the sky was very clear - no clouds).  The object looked whitish blue in color.  There was a full moon to the southeast that was very clear.  You could see the object clearly but the object itself looked kind of faded or blurred (I am not sure if that was because of the sharpness of the moonlight).  A comet is often very small when you see it.    This object was much larger and was the same size or a little smaller than the full moon.   I look up in the sky quite frequently, often times listening to Coast to Coast or other similar shows, but I have never seen an object like this (this large).   The sighting itself was less than a couple of seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.7491739420934;-87.7341541202679
Round bright light, no sound traveling parallel to is then winked out;2019-03-22 19:50:00;60 seconds;Round bright light, no sound traveling parallel to is then winked out We thought what we saw was a bright white headlight of a plane coming in over Lake Michigan, but it moved right to left in a parallel straight line.  If it was a plane head light it would have been coming toward us.  There were no other lights, i.e. red or green wing lights or rear tail fin light.   As it moved to the left it got smaller and smaller then winked out.  We tried to see wings lights or tail light but there was nothing.  It just disappeared.;43.7491739420934;-87.7341541202679
