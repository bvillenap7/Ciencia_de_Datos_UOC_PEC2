Strange V lights;2012-09-04 01:00:00;2 minutes;Strange V lights I saw what at first I thought was the moon then it began to move I told my girl to look that there was the moon behind the clouds, then it moved more  and more to the east.  I had then saw a very solid, like an eclipse going over the so called moon and then it had begun to move away to the east knowing this was not possible for the moon i watch more and then I saw the V shape other than the circle I saw earlier this thing was huge the light was very bright but only got the half cloud covered view then it came out and I saw it but it was huge I mean miles wide I can't explain it.;43.7491739420934;-87.7341541202679
