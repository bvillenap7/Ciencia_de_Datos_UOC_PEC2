Light formation that moved like giant bird soaring silent.;2015-09-20 23:11:00;3-4 seconds;Light formation that moved like giant bird soaring silent. 	I had gone outside to get some air and knew the exact time, of 23:11, because I looked at the clock and It read 11:11.  Over the past year whenever I see this time I take a moment to meditate or reflect and stop whatever I am doing. Outside I was looking at the stars.  Over my shoulder came an object (from the east).  It made no sound and had lights in a chevron shape and 1-2 lights in the middle of the chevron almost tailing the shape, yet still in formation.  Came from the east and headed west to slight southwest. Off of Lake Michigan. It startled me because it moved like a bird soaring with such grace.  Yet it was large or a formation of smaller crafts.  Iâ€™m used to seeing planes at night fly overhead.  This had no sound and moved way too quickly to be a terrestrial craft, or man made. It was surreal because my first instinct was to identify what bird it was., because of the mannerism in which it went across the sky. In the coming hours there were at least two airplanes in the night sky flying around. This is my first known sighting.;43.7491739420934;-87.7341541202679
