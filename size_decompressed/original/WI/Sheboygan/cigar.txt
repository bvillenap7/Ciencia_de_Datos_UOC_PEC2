I looked up to see a craft that at first I felt was an airplane. It was quite shiny but I felt that to be reflection from the sun as it was a nice clear afternoon. After watching it for about 30 secs, I was distracted by my dog for a couple seconds and when I looked back, it was gone. It was flying a very straight and rather slow path going E, NE  out over Lake Michigan. First thing that struck me as odd was that it disapeared before it should have judging by the speed. I should have been able to see it still, I only turned away for a matter of a couple seconds. Then I realized that I heard absolutely no engine sound. As I was looking up yet hoping to spot it, a plane did come my way. I heard the engine sound before I ever saw it. And I felt the plane was way higher than the craft I just saw, judging by size anyway. We also have alot of seagulls in our area, but as I watched a few of them fly around, it was obvious there was no wing activity from the craft I saw. It happened very quickly, and I'm not at all sure what I saw, but I figured if someone else saw this then maybe they would post it here.;43.7491739420934;-87.7341541202679
