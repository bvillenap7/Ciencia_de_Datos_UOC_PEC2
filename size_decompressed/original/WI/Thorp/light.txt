Circles of light - bright as moon. Three in a horizontal row along WSW horizon.  Appeared briefly, then disappeared.  Appeared again seconds later and disappeared again.  Could have been five or so miles away, but difficult to tell.  Color was off-white and shape of each light was circular.  Could not tell whether it was one unit or many. Observers were married couple in their late 50's, in an area they have traveled daily for many years.  Wife saw it first, and it was gone before husband could see.  Then lights reappeared and both saw them.  Claimed they never saw anything like it ever before.;44.9582;-90.7992
