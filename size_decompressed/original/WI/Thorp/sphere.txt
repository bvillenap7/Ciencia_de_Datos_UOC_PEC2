The strage star;2007-08-15 00:00:00;sighting;The strage star At Midnight I noticed a unusual star shaped object moving side to side changing it's  shape as well as it's color.I woke up my wife and daughter,they witnessed this  object with me for over an hour. The craft has returhed on and off for the last couple of months.While watching it I noticed vapor around the ufo,as it sits still ,it appears to be a star,as it moves it flies unlike any aircraft. It swithes directions faster than the naked eye making no noise and knowing when its being watched.It doesn't bother any of us, be sometimes it gives you the creeps to know we are not alone.;44.9582;-90.7992
