Red flashing pulsating lights 2-300 feet suspended in the dark sky.;2019-01-17 06:15:00;1 minute;Red Flashing pulsating lights 2-300 feet suspended in the dark sky. Object was 2-300 feet suspended above the road.  The location was Shiner Drive & HWY 73.  It was dark out.  One end of the object was flat shaped with 2 red pulsating lights on each corner that would alternate.  The opposite end had 1 dim headlight.  It seemed to be the size of a semi-truck but I could not make out the shape because I was driving South on HWY 73 and it was pitch black out.  At first I thought it looked like it could be a cell tower but the nearest tower is 7 miles away.  I looked back when I got 1 mile down the road and it was still suspended in that same location.;44.9582;-90.7992
