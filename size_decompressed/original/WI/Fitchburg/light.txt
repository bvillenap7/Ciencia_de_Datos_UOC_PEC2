Looked like oriens belt, but with 40 stars instead of 3. Me and my wife were traveling down Fitchrona Rd, just outside Fitchburg Wisconsin, when I looked out the car window and saw what appeared to be 20-30 stars lined up like oriens belt.  It immediately struck me because they were all lined up together, and from the side window I was looking out of, it almost looked like a halo of stars around the earth.  At the time, I couldnâ€™t tell if they were moving, so I told my wife to pull over so I could get a better look, because I wanted to see if they were stationary.  When I got out I could see that they were traveling from the west to the east.  We were traveling north to south.  I did shoot a video but is is rather difficult to make out without a big screen.  When I watched the video some of the craft were a little out of line with one another, and I was looking for identifiers as I used to work on planes in the navy, but they were just bright glowing lights.  I also have never seen such a large number of aircraft ! flying together like that.  It reminded me of when you see all the military vehicles on the interstate driving together.  Just one big line going to the same place.;43.0199811602872;-89.4537131578949
