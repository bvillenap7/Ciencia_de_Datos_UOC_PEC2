Cylinder shaped crafts traveling northwest.;2014-09-25 17:00:00;hours on and off;Cylinder shaped crafts traveling northwest. Starting at 5:00PM and continuing until around 8:00PM I saw a series of strange shapes crafts in the sky.  I don't believe they were planes or jets, they didn't make any noise,there were no visible wings, just a bright silverish cylinder shape and they left no con-trails.  They appeared to materialize out of nowhere and some of them vanished as quickly as they came. They all appeared to be following the same Direction East to West.  The fist one I witnessed was around 5PM.  I heard a plane overhead (and I looked to the north and saw a very bright cylinder in the sky, directly above me was a regular airplane.  The cylinder appeared to be the larger than the airplane but had no wings.  It traveled behind a small grove of pine trees, I went to the other side of the trees to get a picture and it had vanished.  It was a beautiful clear day outside not a cloud in sight. I called my husband to tell him about it and while I was on the phone with him another one of these crafts appeared in the sky traveling in the same direction.  I managed to get a photo of it, along with video footage of some of the others that followed.  In total there were about 9 different UFOs, all similar in size and shape and color, traveling in the same direction. They would seem to appear out of nowhere and then travel northwest before vanishing in the sky after about a minute or two. It started to get dark outside and while I was on my way into the house I saw a very bright and large flash of intense light to the north, just behind and above the grove of pine trees.  I felt strange afterward, dizzy like my sense of balance had been disturbed.;43.399;-89.0577
