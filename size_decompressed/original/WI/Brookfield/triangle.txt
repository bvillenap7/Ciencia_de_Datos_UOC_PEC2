A  triangle craft this huge and so low  does not seem possible but it's true.;1993-01-12 19:45:00;12 to 15 min.;A  triangle craft this huge and so low  does not seem possible but it's true. My wife and I were driving west on Capitol Drive when for no special reason we were attracted to this very bright light near the horizon in the west. It looked like a very bright star and was about that size when we first noticed it.It took only a couple minutes to get home from there, we got out of the car and kept looking at it as it slowly came closer. It was very slow and very low. It was a perfect triangle in shape and had round muted lights around the three sides,on the bottom of it about 8 or 10 lights on each side. The color of it was gray-black. It looked no more than several city blocks up in the air it looked that low. We were able to watch it for at least 10 minutes till it went south east and I thought it was going towards the airport. Was a beautiful Craft very huge and no sound.

Two groups of  yellow -orange lights formed a moving, silent triangle that rose into the night sky faded and disappeared;2009-09-12 21:05:00;5-10 minutes;Two groups of  yellow -orange lights formed a moving, silent triangle that rose into the night sky faded and disappeared On September 12,2009 at 9:05PM a series of three slow moving lights were seen in the sky over Brookfield East H.S. They made no sound.  They appeared to drift slowly in a Southerly direction.  The lights were bright, somewhat yellow-orange and faded in brightness as they moved higher in the sky and then disappeared.  Both myself and my husband saw the event.  We saw some students near the building and we went to ask them if they had seen the lights.  They answered no but as they were saying no, one pointed out that another group of three lights was coming up from the North at that very moment.  Again there were three bright lights yellow-orange. At first straight across. They then formed a triangle and slowly and silently moved in a delta form towards the Southwest. The lights dimmed and separated disappearing high in the sky. There were 6 objects in all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.0655665859573;-88.1431995157377
