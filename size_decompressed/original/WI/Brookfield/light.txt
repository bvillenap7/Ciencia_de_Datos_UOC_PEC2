I thought it was a promotional thing some local business was doing, but the lights rotated out of there order and the lights, which seemed about 3 to 5 hundred feet in the air were flickering.  Seemed to be a bit of an orange core, but yellow ambient glow.  I was driving at the time, so as I past them I had actually circle around them. So I pulled into a gas station took out my phone, trying to unlock the screen so I could access the camera, I look up and 3 had disappeared and the other three looked in the most peculiar way, floating, but disappearing into the clouds.  The clouds were covering the eastern side of the night sky, which must have been hovering over milwaukee 8-12 miles away.  This was the most awe inspiring thing I had ever seen.  I did not report it though, I want to see how many people report it first so, I don't feel so mad.  Anyone else?  There was no sound also.  I saw a helicopter flying arou! nd the area too about 20 minutes later.;43.0655665859573;-88.1431995157377
Bright light, getting closer, not a plane, satellite, or meteor.;2014-08-17 21:30:00;5 minutes;Bright light, getting closer, not a plane, satellite, or meteor Hello. Last night me, my girlfriend, and my parents all saw something unconventional.   After seeing what I saw, I wanted to see if anyone else in the area had seen anything unusual, and that's when I saw an article by a local reporter on WTMJ about lights over Waukesha. Let me tell you our story:  Last night, Aug 17th, I'd say around 9:30ish, didn't look at the clock but somewhere between 9 and 10, me and my girlfriend were out in front of my parents’ house letting the dogs out.  I happened to look up at the night sky and it was such a clear night and so many stars.  As I was looking up, something bright and moving fairly fast towards the Southeast caught my attention. At first I was positive it was a satellite as I have seen them time and time before whenever I camp.  I ran inside and told my parents to come outside quick to see the satellite moving across the sky.  We went out in the backyard, meanwhile my girlfriend was in the front yard watching the same thing. When we went out on the back patio, I was surprised that the Satellite wasn't further to the east because of the speed it was travelling before.  In fact, it was still moving but it was as if this thing got real close to us.  At first it was a small little dot, just like how a satellite appears.  But this thing was getting closer to us because the size got bigger and that light was so bright. At this point, we knew it wasn't a satellite because satellites are orbiting around the earth and don't really change their depth level, at least that I know of.  It wasn't any plane we've ever seen because there were no blinking lights, nothing that you see on planes.  In fact, there was no sound at all.  If it were a plane, it would have definitely been low enough for us to hear the plane roar.  Then it changed course from a straight line, curved just slightly, turned smaller and morphed into a red light as it was passing us and disappeared.  There were no clouds for any plane to have hid behind, ruling out that this was a plane.   It wasn't a meteor or anything like that because there was no tail, or trail of debris behind this thing.  It was an object, very, very, bright.  In fact it was so bright, you could almost see the light beams emitting from it.   And I can’t be positive, but it almost looked like it was a bunch of little lights all making up one big bright light. ! I can't say I am 100% on that though because it was far away.   I am 100% sure though that this was a first that any of us had ever seen.  There was also a shooting star that passed right in front of this thing only going south west.  This bright object was moving south east. Anyway, I just thought it was really, for lack of a more captivating word interesting. Have a nice day and thanks for your time;43.0655665859573;-88.1431995157377
Light in sky, stationary, flash of light every 2-3 minutes.;2014-08-25 22:30:00;20 minutes;Light in sky, stationary, flash of light every 2-3 minutes Me and my girlfriend went outside to smoke a cigarette a little after 10:30. Nice clear night with very little clouds in the area.  We were looking at the stars and planes and watching for unusual stuff bc last week we had seen something that peaked our interest.  (Last event was witnessed by me, my gf, my mom and dad, 4 witnesses in total).   However, last night while watching a plane we noticed a bright flash.  At first I thought it to be a firefly in the corner of my eye.  However after staring at the spot where we had seen it for about 3 minutes, it went off again, in the same location. It was above the trees and was just a quick on and off flash.  Almost as if someone up in the sky had a flashlight and was signaling.  This happened about every 2-3 minutes. And each time I thought it was done and about to turn to go in, it flashed.  After a while I was feeling like whatever it was, was doing it on purpose to toy with me. After about the 8th time it went off I went in to get my dad, but when he came out it didn't go off, which just made us look like we were making it up.  But he believed us bc of what we all saw last week.  Anyway, at first I wasn't going to report this bc I just reported something last week and I don't want to appear like I'm crazy or doing this for attention.  Just seems like there’s something going on recently in the Waukesha/Brookfield area.  Thanks for your time;43.0655665859573;-88.1431995157377
3 yellow orbs over Brookfield, Wisconsin.;2015-09-27 21:18:00;1 minute;3 yellow orbs over Brookfield, Wisconsin. Me and both my parents saw 3 yellow glowing orbs that were traveling to the north during the lunar eclipse.   All 3 appeared when the lunar eclipse near completely full.  They were traveling west slowly and took a sharp right to the north west and disappeared within 45 seconds.   They were within a half of a mile from our porch in the beginning, and disappeared within 45 seconds at least 10-15 miles away from our porch with a steady incline.;43.0655665859573;-88.1431995157377
