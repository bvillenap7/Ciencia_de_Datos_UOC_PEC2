Bright light shows another bigger object that blended into the sky but flashed.;2009-01-26 11:05:00;20 min.;Bright light shows another bigger object that blended into the sky but flashed. My mother and I were sitting in our living room watching court files. The couch and chair that we were on faces the kitchen.  In which I was baking cookies and would check periodically.  As i was sitting on the chair i noticed in the kitchen window a giant yellow/white light.  I could tell it wasnt a star it was shinning to much and it wasnt a plane cause it kept in one place for more then 20 mins.  So i went to go check out what exactly it was through the window.  As i looked at it. In the corner of my eye in the sky, to the right of this light about 100ft away was another object that caught my eye.  This object was much bigger in size like 3 times bigger.  Only this object was from what i saw for a split second kinda round a flash of lights around the side flashed in a row, then when i turned my eyes to look at it. The object was gone. I knew I saw something so i looked harder and when i looked the object infact had not dissapeared at all. it was still there just very well hidden. I cant really discribe it. It was as if the object had and was trying to blend in with the sky. It did really wel too.( at this point I called my mom to come and look at it incase my eyes were playing jokes on me or if i was krazie) After i pointed out where the hidden object was and then she too saw it. and was lost of words.) I only noticed it cause there was those flashes of quick light and there was a tiny outline of light and an object that was pretty big in size. The object stayed there for almost an hour then slowly started to completly dissapear. I tried to take a picture of the object but when I did the object was to well hidden to show up and the window gave a flash reflection when I tried.)  As for the other light that was there. that too had dissapeared about 2 mins after i started staring at the other object. the bright light literally just dissapeared in the blink of an eye. It was seriously something that was not normal. Ill never forget this night!!!;43.0655665859573;-88.1431995157377
