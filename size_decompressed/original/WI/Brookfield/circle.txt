Three amber colored lights moving at various distances.  No blinking aircraft lights or sound.;2009-09-12 21:00:00;Less than 15 minutes;Three amber colored lights moving at various distances.  No blinking aircraft lights or sound. I clean an accountants office in the Town of Brookfield at the corner of Capitol Drive and Lilly Road.  My son and I do the job together. I had to step outside and get some furniture polish from my van.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed some lights that appeared to be about 3 blocks south of me across the very busy Capitol Drive.  They were orange like the lights on a TV broadcast antenna.  The lights were stacked vertically exactly like the safety lights on a tall antenna.  I thought to myself , I don't recall seeing an antenna there before.  At that I turned to take another look and noticed they weren't in a vertical stack anymore, but were moving closer together and lower down toward the level of the tree tops. I called my son outside to get his opinion about what I was seeing.  Just when he came out he was able to get a glimpse of them dip below the tree tops and we figured they were gone.  He went into the van and grabbed his little hand held video camera just in case they appeared again.  We then noticed the lights were still visible through the trees.  The lights then started to rise again.  They moved in relation to each other in a sort of triangle.  After getting bright and dim a couple times they suddenly disappeared. My son's video is on YouTube.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od637rz2U00  I later looked up on google maps where we saw the lights descend below the tree tops to see what was over that way because they would have had to be practically on the ground.  On google earth we found a swampy area near Brookfield Highschool that would is about 80ft lower in altitude then our observation location.  So the lights could have still been above the ground but appear to us as being at ground level through the trees. I originally posted a report on Mufon.  Unfortunately I'm not a member so I can't seem to access that information which included a video.  They called me back and said they thought the video was interesting but they never investigated.  I thought about going from door to door in that area to see if anyone else saw the lights but I figured Mufon would do that. When I looked up that date on Nuforc I noticed a husband and wife reported seeing the lights in the same area on the same date - same time.  Their location was south of mine.  If Nuforc wants to give anyone my phone number they can. Also someone recently reported a pizza truck driver at Capitol Drive and Lilly road that witnessed something similar on September 5 2010.;43.0655665859573;-88.1431995157377
3 orange disc shaped lights observed in eastern sky near Milwaukee, moving north, stopped and formed triangle.;2010-07-11 00:20:00;3 minutes;3 orange disc shaped lights observed in eastern sky near Milwaukee, moving north, stopped and formed triangle. Three orange balls were observed in the eastern sky traveling south to north shortly after midnight.  They were moving slowly.  The one which appeared to be in the lead then stopped, and the other two, one at a time, formed a perfect triangle, standing still for about a minute. The observer then went to summon other family members.  Another person went outside to look moments later and observed one orange disc in the sky at about 45 degrees from the horizon.  It appeared to pulse, getting stronger and fainter about twice a second, and faded and disappeared in about a minute. It was a cloudy night, hot and muggy.  There had been thunderstorms earlier. Stars were not visible.  The objects were silent. Observers are: A white male in his fifties, a goldsmith by trade and white female in her sixties, his spouse. We are middle class people and have never seen anything like this.;43.0655665859573;-88.1431995157377
Strange round flaming orange/gold craft flying in the sky;2010-09-29 20:25:00;3 minutes;Strange round flaming orange/gold craft flying in the sky Saw a round-type object that appeared to be on fire - it had a fiery orange/gold flickering glow on its underside. It traveled from the south towards the north and then headed southeast and quickly disappeared in some clouds.  The orange glow was remarkable because there were no regular aircraft lights visible (such as white flashing lights or red or green).  Initially we were concerned it was an aircraft on fire, but it continued to fly without incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

The object seeing before by me (last 4th of July - 2015) a round bright green light that goes up in the air probably 100 floors height.;2016-07-04 21:00:00;30;The object seeing before by me (last 4th of July - 2015) a round bright green light that goes up in the air probably 100 floors height. and after 10 minutes or so it lowers itself to the ground, disappearing into the horizon. Same thing happens for 5 or 6 times. No sound small and close by I would say approx 1/2 of mile away. Where you can see there are helicopters and airplanes. This object just gets lost in between trees. This actually was captured from the Brookfield Academy northeast parking lot, while watching the fireworks looking south.  Object was southeast from my location.  Southwest from Mithell park. Thanks for reading. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
