Red light seen over Door County;2000-07-25 22:23:00;5 min.;Red light seen over Door County I left my cousin's house around 22:10 and I decided to take a ride on the back roads.  After a short while in the car I glanced up and noticed a non-flashing red light with sort of a dim purpleish tint around it.  It was steadily moving northeast and I continued to follow it until I could not keep up with it anymore.  The light flew over Lake Michigan and that is about the time I lost visual contact.;44.8438999999999;-87.3733999999999

Two bright lights over Lake Michigan, one full of colors, the other still light, same distance above water.;2003-01-16 18:30:00;so far 25 min.;Two bright lights over Lake Michigan, one full of colors, the other still light, same distance above water. Two bright lights were over Lake Michigan, so close to the shore at first I thought it was a helicopter or plane coming in, but they just hovered and didn't move position.  The one on the right was as bright as a planet like Venus only twinkled with blue, red, green, and yellow and in looking through the spotting scope which isn't very strong, looked bow shaped.  The one on the left, maybe a mile - 2 (hard to tell distance over water and above) from the other one was at the exact same distance above the water, but did not twinkle at all, just a very bright yellow light.  I noticed them at 6:30 P.M. They are still there at 7:00 P.M. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness appears to provide a very precise description of what the star, Sirius, and the planet, Venus, look like in the eastern sky during the early evening hours.  PD));44.8438999999999;-87.3733999999999

Driving up to Fish Creek, I stopped to take a break.  While speaking on the phone with my spouse, I witnessed a moving light over the waters of Green Bay.  It zig-zagged, sometimes very quickly, sometimes slowly, traveling in different directions. At times it would stop.  It was a very clear night, and I was far away from any towns or homes. This occurred near three large radio transmitting towers.   It seemed to be surveying either the waters of Green Bay or the towers.;44.8438999999999;-87.3733999999999
Brief moving light, turned off as if on a dimmer switch;2010-08-06 22:15:00;5 seconds;Brief moving light, turned off as if on a dimmer switch Parked on 3rd Avenue, in front of the Door County Advocate newspaper offices(Directly in front of the stone map on the building), waiting for a friend. The night was clear, with no clouds or any fog/haze. Looking to the north, when I happened to see a light in the sky at roughly 343 degrees. In the brief time I saw it, object/light appeared to be moving on a course of roughly 335. Then within 1 second, light dimmed and went out, like what you see when using a dimmer switch on a house light. (The below are representations - events like these NEVER seem to happen when I am carrying a camera. %^&*%&*) http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c210/CaptPower/BSP/2010-08-06sighting.jpg  http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c210/CaptPower/BSP/2010-08-06sightingb.jpg  At no time before, during, or after did I hear any sounds of aircraft (either prop or jet), and the object/light did not make any sound that I could hear. There were several other people out in front of Van's bar at the time, but (unfortunately)  I don't think they saw it as 1 had his back to it, the other was turned slightly away.;44.8438999999999;-87.3733999999999
Bright light spot bouncing around erratically in south west.;2015-12-04 22:28:00;>10 minutes;Bright light spot bouncing around erratically in south west. My wife and I watched this spot of light make rapid but short excursions at about 35 degrees above the horizon in the south east probably 120 degrees.  The intensity and location is like Venus but the time is wrong.  The light changes position erratically and fast too fast for an airplane.  Moves right left up and down always returning to roughly the same location.;44.8438999999999;-87.3733999999999
