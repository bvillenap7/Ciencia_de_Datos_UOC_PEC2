A line of 3-5 lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Starlink satellites?  PD))((anonymous source));2019-05-26 22:40:00;3;We were sitting around a campfire and looked up to see a line of 3-5 lights.  We watched them glide Northeast extremely fast, silently, and relatively close to the ground.  The craft(s) were definitely in the atmosphere but were absolutely silent.  The lights moved at the exact same speed and stayed a directly proportional distance from one another.  It was very distinct.
