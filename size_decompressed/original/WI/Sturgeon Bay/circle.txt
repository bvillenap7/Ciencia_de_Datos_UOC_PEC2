While over at a neighbor's party, myself, my neighbor, and at least one of his guests observed a commercial aircraft flying from west-northwest to east-southeast.  As we watched, a solid white light (which we at first assumed to be a satellite) lit up, moving in the exact same direction as and roughly 1-2 miles directly behind the commercial aircraft.  Both aircraft and light were slightly to the south of us, traveling from about west northwest to east southeast.   As one of the guests attempted to record it, the light began to dim - yet several seconds before disappearing completely, I witnessed it come to a complete stop!  Unknown if guest managed to succeed in recording object.  And NO - I had NOT been drinking.;44.8438999999999;-87.3733999999999
