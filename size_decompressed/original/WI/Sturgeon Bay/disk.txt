Distant sphere-shaped object in the sky seen moving about in unpredictable and impossible directions over Lake Michigan.;2011-11-28 21:00:00;About half an hour;Distant sphere-shaped object in the sky seen moving about in unpredictable and impossible directions over Lake Michigan. I've been following a suspicious shape in the sky for some time. I thought I may just have been paranoia, but for the last month I've been seeing this 'star' just to the right of Orion's belt (usually) move in unpredictable and unexplainable ways.  To make sure it wasn't like anything else, I've been paying special attention to the way that airplanes and satellites have been moving. I'm a scientific person--and so the fact that this shape was darting in every direction across the sky all the while beaming a blueish/white light seemed extremely bizarre.  Alas, it never happened when I wanted it to, but just tonight while I was on my balcony it appeared.  Fortunately, I had my family over and I ushered them back to see it.  They all noticed the scene, and all were aghast and more or less creeped out. The disk was distant, but a faint outline could be seen. It emitted one strong light from its center and a seemingly smaller light just above that. The shape rotated ! around in the sky in bizarre motions, and, while it first appeared to the right of Orion's Belt, by the time I stopped watching it, it was to the left. While I'm sure this tale isn't as bizarre as many others reported here, I was curious to see if anyone else had seen this tonight. It seemed as though anyone looking out at the sky in the area would have noticed the event.;44.8438999999999;-87.3733999999999
