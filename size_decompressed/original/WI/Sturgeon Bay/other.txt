Army Airborne drills over the bay;2000-07-25 22:23:00;5min;Army Airborne drills over the bay http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13594.html Red light seen over Door County  I left my cousin's house around 22:10 and I decided to take a ride on the back roads.  After a short while in the car I glanced up and noticed a non-flashing red light with sort of a dim purpleish tint around it.  It was steadily moving northeast and I continued to follow it until I could not keep up with it anymore.  The light flew over Lake Michigan and that is about the time I lost visual contact.   Someone reported a sighting, the site was actually the Army Airborne running para-trooping drills over the bay in a C130.  The light was the bay doors which have red lights on the inside giving off the appearance of a purple border on the lower sides from the reflection off the bay.  This happens from May to November every year, sometimes even get the F-15's and some various Helo-copters models flying in formation.  Looks pretty cool but it's definitely identified.
