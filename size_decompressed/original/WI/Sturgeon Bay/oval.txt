Low Flying oval craft with flashing colored lights moving slowly across the sky.;2009-10-25 18:15:00;6 minutes +;Low Flying oval craft with flashing colored lights moving slowly across the sky. My dad, his girlfriend, and I all saw the flying craft. It looked like an oval moving pretty slowly and low in the sky. It caught my attention pretty easily. It almost looked like it was headed towards the Airport which is pretty close to where I saw it. It has the ability to hover, not sure for how long but it did it a few times for about 10 seconds each time. It had many bright flashing lights, and they seemed to rotate around the craft. The colors varied from yellow, blue, green, red and purple. It was pretty far away but I could still see it clearly for the most part. It was a clear blue sky and it was all open area. The area has some woods but is mainly fields and clear land. I was inside my house and I saw it through the window, it must be a very silent moving craft because my dad had not seen it when I called him. He was taking a walk and he had no idea it was there until I told him about it. It was too far away to look like anything more than a tiny ! circle of light on the camera on my phone.;44.8438999999999;-87.3733999999999
