Thunder, and fireworks noise for 3 nights straight, reported at 5 am by 20 residents.;2012-03-19 05:00:00;Hour;Thunder, and fireworks noise for 3 nights straight, reported at 5 am by 20 residents. It is unclear at this moment, whether a UFO was seen.  It is possible that someone has not come forward, or gone public with any possible evidence of a sighting, but so far no sighting has been made.  From March 19th 2012, to March 22nd 2012, at approximately 5 am each morning, the Clintonville dispatch has reported over twenty phone calls from local Clintonville residents, complaining about loud noise, similar to fireworks, thunder, and rattling noise.  It has occurred for 3 night’s straight now, and researchers have declared it to be a 1.5 earthquake.  Others, like me, question this theory, and are searching for a more accurate answer, with solid evidence.  I am requesting your knowledge and experience in UFO sightings, and phenomenon.  I would like someone to question the local residents who heard the noises, and I wonder if maybe someone has seen something abnormal.  Maybe the police are not asking the right questions, or to avoid panic throughout the to! wn, not disclosing evidence of a sighting, and quieting the town with an explanation of an earthquake.  Please look into the report’s on this Clintonville earthquake, and do your own research.  Maybe it is worth your time.;44.6363999999997;-88.7430000000002
