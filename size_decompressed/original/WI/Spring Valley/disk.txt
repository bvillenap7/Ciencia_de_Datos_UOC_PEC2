Low-flying silver craft, reflecting sunlight,  completely silent, suddenly disappeared;2017-10-17 17:00:00;1 minute;Low-flying silver craft, reflecting sunlight,  completely silent, suddenly disappeared My 10 year old son and I were driving north on City Rd CC between Hwy 72 and Cty Rd G, which is a sparsely populated area of farmland.  The craft appeared directly in front of us flying westward.  It was low flying, silver, and reflecting a lot of sunlight. At first I thought it must be a helicopter, since it was flying so low, but it was more of a cigar-shape.  I pointed it out to my son, and I said, “What is that?”  It then shifted to a north-west direction, then it looked more like a disc.  We both got very excited, because it was obviously not a plane or a helicopter.  As we continued driving, a line of trees blocked our vision for about 5 seconds, and the craft was gone. It was a very clear sky with only a few wispy clouds, and the craft was flying way below where the clouds were.  There was nowhere it could have hid behind.  It was just suddenly gone.  We then saw it again about 30 seconds later several miles away.  It suddenly disappeared again.  It was silent and left no contrails.;44.8372;-92.2885
