I noticed, directly at the midheaven, two bright lights and a swath of light out in front of the lights.  The lights and the swath were moving accross the sky under the Milky Way, and they retained their relative positions to each other. That is, the lights lined up in the direction of travel, and the swath out in front not quite in line with the lights, and not touching the lights.  Also, as to the quality of the lights, one of we who saw it noticed that they did not flicker as stars do, but were brighter and had a steady light.  As to the swath, it was three or more times longer than the space between the lights and maybe a third the lights space apart in width.  The slightly uneven shape of the swath did not change in shape or quality, and the whole unit, which had no apparrent body besides the lights themselves, moved steadily toward the horrizon.  From midheaven to horizon I estimate about three minutes. It was seen by two parties of two on the island(Madaline) at that time and by young campers two hours away near Manitowish Waters, though the campers reports are less specific and are second hand as told to their captain.
