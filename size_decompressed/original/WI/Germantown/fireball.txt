She saw seven fireballâ€™s in the sky.  She opened the door and told my boyfriend and myself to get in her car.  We headed a block away to a park with a large field.  When I saw them it was around 9:18 or 9:20pm and I only saw five they were in the northeast direction, a little bit more east than north.   They were a red-orange and had a round shape.   They moved slowly one at a time towards a certain point in the sky where they each slowly faded away one at time.  The whole time the objects seemed to be an even distance from one another, they were slightly bigger and brighter than stars.  And I believe they were at a 60-70 degree angle in the sky.   My roommate said when they were in a formation when she first saw them.  She drew a picture of the formation but I am not sure how to describe it to you.  If you like I can send you a drawing of the f! ormation she described anonymously. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
