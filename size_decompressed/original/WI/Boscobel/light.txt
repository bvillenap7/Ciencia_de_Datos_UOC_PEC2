A red light making smoke and stopped making smoke going east.;1999-10-13 19:45:00;5 minutes;A red light making smoke and stopped making smoke going east. It was a red light. It was heading east. It looked like a star. It wasn't a plane because it was only one light. It wasn't making any smoke at first until about two minutes. It made Black smoke for thirty seconds then stopped making smoke for about thirdy seconds then started making smoke again. It repeated that process twice and then I bent down to tie my shoe and when I got up it wasn't there anymore. It was weird. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness implies a night time sighting.
