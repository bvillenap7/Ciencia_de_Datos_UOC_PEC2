The color of the object was a white or light gray. I could tell this because it was hovering as low as a crop duster plain. It was also as big around as a house. As I came up to it and pulled to the side of the road it hovered for bout 1 minute before zipping really fast to the next bridge where it then stopped, and sat for an additional 3 to 5 minutes.;43.1393;-90.7126
