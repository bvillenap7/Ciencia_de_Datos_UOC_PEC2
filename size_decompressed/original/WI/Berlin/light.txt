Light over Berlin WI area.;2013-09-30 20:00:00;~20 minutes;Light over Berlin WI area. Just before 8 pm. I saw a light off to the SW hovering over an area just north of Berlin, WI.  It would hover and then sway from side to side a bit, then suddenly dip down and rise back up quickly.  While odd, what got my attention more was that about a dozen other aircraft with anti collision lights began heading over towards that area of the sky as if to observe or interact with this light.  I thought that a lot of attention to be given if it were just some lighted balloon (weather balloon) or some prankster's lighted kite.  Some of these aircraft seemed to have search lights turned on although they were up too high to be searching the  ground and did not have their lamps aimed at the ground. There also appeared to be brief flashes of light from areas near that region of the sky that I could not visually associate with any visible aircraft.  After about twenty minutes of such hijinks, the light in question began to move lower on the visible horizon either moving! down or traveling wsw away from me and disappeared below horizon.  The other aircraft remained interested in that area of the sky.  I went inside and just kind of scratched my head and thought it a bit odd. Saw nothing alien or that fantastic. Just looked like odd behavior.  I would also add that there seemed to be kind of an aura in the sky in that area of it. as if night sky were more energized than normal is the only way I can think to describe it.;43.9769000000001;-88.9517
