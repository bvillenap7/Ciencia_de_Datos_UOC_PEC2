This would keep continuing. There also were several little blinking lights all over the sky surrounding it. The orange craft would keep appearing and disappearing in different places in the sky fairly low to the ground. Then the last time we saw the fireball appear it had several orangish-red lights around the bottom of an oval shaped craft. Then it disappeared. Also as all of this was going on there were about 4 or 5 lights that would fly along with the craft which were just a bit smaller than the craft. Those and the several all over the sky were white colored. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  Possibly 2006 sighting, or a sighting on March 19, 2007.  We have amended the date.  PD));43.9769000000001;-88.9517
