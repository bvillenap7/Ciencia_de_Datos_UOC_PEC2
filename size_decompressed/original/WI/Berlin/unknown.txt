Large red light speeding over Berlin, WI.;2001-08-15 22:30:00;2 minutes;Large red light speeding over Berlin, WI. I was traveling on County Highway A at about 70 mph just outside of Berlin, driving past Mascoutin Golf Course, and heading for the town of Berlin at about 22:30.  As I was driving, I notice a craft with a bright red colored light on it, not blinking, and bigger than an airplane light.  The light was the predominant feature of the craft, and in the front.  The proportions were if you would take a lightbulb and attach it to a half blown up balloon.  There were other lights on the object as well, but the big red light was the main feature.  It was low in the sky, but not incredibly, but it was moving very fast.  I saw it for about 1 minute before I had to turn and head north towards town.  It was moving very fast, and quickly getting out of my field of vision, but I was still able to see it, I was still going 70 mph.  I watched it for about another 45 seconds to 1 minute before reaching Berlin, where I had to slow down, and then lost sight of the craft.  The whole time, the red light did not blink, and the object moved incredibly fast.;43.9769000000001;-88.9517
