Two fast flying diamond shaped objects over West Salem, WI.;2017-11-07 22:35:00;30 seconds;Two fast flying diamond shaped objects over West Salem, WI. Standing outside, I looked up at the sky towards Orion (east) and saw two slender 4 sided diamond-shaped objects flying at a fast speed towards Onalaska/LaCrosse.  They were flying one in front and one to the bottom right.  (Like one at 12 and one at 4 on a clock)   It took about 15 seconds for them to fly from one side of the sky to the other.  No lights on them at all, but they were dark against the cloudless sky with a bright moon behind them. No sound came off of them either.;43.9078;-91.0939
