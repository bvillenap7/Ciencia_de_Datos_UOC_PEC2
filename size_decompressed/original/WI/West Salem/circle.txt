We were sitting on the back porch a dark small rain cloud rolled in providing a nice contest to the sky. Looking up I saw a softball shaped craft move toward the northwest at an unusually fast speed.  No sound report came from it.  When it cleared the clouds its shape was clearly identifiable as a round ball shape.  It moved out of viewShyer five seconds. No airport traffic was reported in the area.;43.9078;-91.0939
