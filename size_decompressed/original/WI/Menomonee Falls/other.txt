Strange silent moving object in the sky.;2017-11-19 17:50:00;1 minute;Strange silent moving object in the sky When exiting the car to enter the apartment, 8 year old boy looks up at the sky to wish on a star then asks if the object in the sky was a hang glider.  I looked up and saw a large, gray lined outline moving silently in the air around a low cloud level.  The object had to be at least 200ft wide (tip to tip) shaped similar to { shape.  It looked like nothing more that that, with evenly spaced ridges along the outline.  It was moving a minimum of 50mph across the sky silently.  I maintained a visual for about 1 minute before it was too far to see.;43.1604000000004;-88.1172999999998
