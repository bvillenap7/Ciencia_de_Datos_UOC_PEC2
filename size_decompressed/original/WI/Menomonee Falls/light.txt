Star wars in the wisconsin northern skys!!!;2011-07-22 21:10:00;35 min;Star wars in the wisconsin northern skys!!! At 9:10 pm on july 22nd 2011, two associates and myself observed what looked like a satellite in the northeast sky traveling north.  It looked the same shape, size and brightness as the surronding stars.  As it approached near perfect north in the sky a small very bright light zipped right in front of it, almost like a rocket.  Then the lights just dissapeared.  We were shocked and amazed at what we witnessed.   Then near the same place where we saw the 1st light dissapear we saw another star like object appear and start to glow extreamly bright.  Then it got dimmerabout as bright as the surronding stars, and started to travel towards the same path as the first light had taken.  Only in the opposite direction.   When it had gotten about true east it vanished from view getting slightly dimmer througout its entire path starting from its bright beginning.   Within a minute or two after, another object appeared where the second had appeared. It too presented with a bright light which drew our attention and followed the exact path as the previous light.  As if it was following the light before it.   Throughout the next 20 minutes or so we were treated to at least 5 or 6 more of the same lights appearing with a flash and traveling through the sky.  Although to and from many different directions.   After a 5 minute period of rest in the sky I told the fellows we had to get back to work.  By 21:45 it was all over.   Several more times through the evening until midnight when we all left work, I peeked outside to see cloud cover and was un-able to see any more action in the sky.;43.1604000000004;-88.1172999999998
Looking West at Venus seeing multiple lights over 25 of them moving almost evenly spaced going due East. ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-06 19:15:00;20+ minutes;Looking West at Venus seeing multiple lights over 25 of them moving almost evenly spaced going due East.  One of the light object was a double at about 16 or 17th place.  Objects were very high, higher than aircraft.  Look like moving stars.;43.1604000000004;-88.1172999999998
Pulsing light near comet Neowise;2020-07-17 22:15:00;10 Minutes;Pulsing light near comet Neowise On the evening of July, 17th around 10pm I was outside my house observing comet Neowise with binoculars as well as taking photos with my phone’s camera.  The comet was north-northwest of my position and about 10 degrees above the horizon, slightly to the north of the big dipper, which was roughly 25-35 degrees above the horizon.  The sky was cloudless and very clear. At approximately 10:15pm I observed a pinpoint light moving from the horizon, just west of the comet, towards the bowl of the big dipper. This light was white/yellow and brighter than the background stars. To the naked eye it appeared to be slowly pulsing, or varying in brightness. It also was not travelling in a straight line, it meandered a few degrees to the left and to the right. I used trained the binoculars on it which did not further resolve any features but enhanced the pulsing, giving the impression that perhaps the object was tumbling. When it reached the middle of the bowl of the big dipper it changed directions entirely and started moving due east from my position, parallel to the horizon. My impression was that it was moving at the approximate speed of a plane at distance, or of a satellite, which are often easily observed from my location. I checked my plane tracking app and there were no planes flying in the area. Obviously due to the path of the object I knew it was not an artificial satellite. The object dimmed as it moved east but was still easily visible to the naked eye. Though I was tracking it with binoculars. In several minutes it moved about 30 degrees due east, at which point it came to a complete stop and I observed, through the binoculars, a much dimmer and smaller point of light approach it from the north, moving very rapidly. This second light passed “right” in front of the first object and quickly disappeared, and the first light then proceeded due east. At this point, approximately 10:15-10:20 pm I lost visual entirely due to my tree line. I texted an abbreviated version of the above to my wife who was camping with family 120 miles west of my position. She and another family member has observed the same light move in the same path, including going through the bowl of the big dipper. Meaning that the object must have been at significant altitude, ruling out planes and low earth orbit satellites.;43.1604000000004;-88.1172999999998
