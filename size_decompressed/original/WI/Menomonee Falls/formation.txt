I was walking home from the library last night.  Full twilight.  Sky still purplish, but on it's way to full dark.  To the east I saw three copper/deep orange lights in the shape of a massive, upside down, isoceles triangle.  Two on top, one on the bottom.  I'm still dumbfounded describing this.   I was cutting through a park, saw a woman walking her dog several yards away but she did not seem to notice this phenomenon.  The lights weren't super bright, but their color and placement made them hard to miss.  They flickered a little, like stars.   As I watched, the two lights that made up the &quotbottom&quot of the triangle very slowly rotated to the left, changing the distance between the two lights slightly.  The &quottop&quot light remained stationery.   One by one, the three lights winked out, almost looking like candles guttering out.  It was still light enough for me to see that where the lights once were, there was nothing but sky.   Haven't heard anything on the news or seen anything online.  There has to be someone else in the area who saw this?;43.1604000000004;-88.1172999999998
