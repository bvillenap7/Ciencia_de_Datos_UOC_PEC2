Jest chasing objects: Jet goes down in local farm.;1999-09-13 02:15:00;60.3Sec;Jest chasing objects: Jet goes down in local farm. This was in the paper 1 day and then it was not mentioned again, Wi State Journal 07 Sept 99 afternoon edition (capital times). (rough copied for speedness) (API)  Again the USAF-WNG was making un-announced low level fly-by's and it (they) seemed to be chasing 6 little balls of light. This is not the first time either. 4 previous nights they have been awaking folks in the middle of the night, but the Control Tower at Truax Feild deny's any activity. Well today the proof is not in theyre hands, one of their F-16's did infact go down south of Mt. Horeb for no apparent reason. The Guard unit blames it on mechanical failure, but witnesses describe a shoot out between the jets and the objects when one of the lights turned a different color and emmited a ray type of glow and took out the F-16 # WNG46-5607 piloted by Col. Ralph Emmit USAF WNG Commander. He was unavailable for comment and still is in UW Hospital being treated for non life threatning injuries. The USAF in has not offically commented on this matter and the NTSB was not present at the crash site. ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Messrs. William McNeff, MUFON State Director for Minnesota, Mr. Fred Olson, and Mr. Jay Rath for having investigated the case and reported back to us.  Apparently, the report was a hoax.  Mr. McNeff's e-mail address is below.  PD))  William McNeff wrote:  Dear Peter: It is about time I closed the loop on this one.  We have determined   there is no such address as W2555 S Vinger RD, Blanchardville, although there is a Vinger Road.  Repeated calls to the phone number yielded only an uninformative answering machine message, and no replies to  the messages we left were received.  The investigator, Fred Olson, writes: There are two daily newspapers in Madison, The Wisconsin State Journal and The Capital Times.  They were once very different papers-- the Cap Times was started by striking Journal workers.  Then they were both bought by Lee Enterprises and made into Madison Newspapers incorporated.  The State Journal is the  morning paper and the Cap Times is the evening            I and two other people did electronic database checking of both papers.  One person was author/writer     Jay Rath and the other was the MNI librarian.  I checked the microfilm records of The Capital Times from 9/1 to 9/15, 1999,reading every page TWICE, as there are two editions of theCap Times which are recorded one after another daily on the microfilm.  So we are at a dead end on this, and believe it to be a hoax.  Thanks for your assistance. Sincerely,Bill McNeffMUFON State Director for Minnesota  <w.McNeff@worldnet.ATT.net>;42.806;-89.8537
