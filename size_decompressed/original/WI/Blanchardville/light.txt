Loud rumbling sound, a plane's lights, and anomylous lights.;2016-11-14 19:00:00;3-4 minutes;Loud rumbling sound, a plane's lights, and anomylous lights. There was a very loud, rumbling plane sound outside.  My boyfriend went out onto the deck of the house after our dog reacted to the noise and wanted to go onto the deck.  My boyfriend, then asked me to join him on the deck immediately.  I went out and saw a plane’s lights heading west to east on the right side of the full moon.  We were facing south.  The rumbling sound was abnormally loud.   I went in to grab my phone and came back out. I then saw a new flashing light move from west to east toward the plane.  The flash of the new light wasn’t right.  It was like a camera flash or a strobe flash.  It flashed a fast bright white, moved, flashed a single flash again, moved, etc.  The light moved quickly towards the plane, and then moved beyond it towards the east.  The light then made a fast u-turn and headed back to the west.  It moved across the sky and then moved along the tree line and disappeared. My boyfriend saw more of these lights when he went out just prior to me (4?).  He mentioned seeing one make a 45 degree angle turn. I thought I was taking a video after I grabbed my phone, but one wasn’t recorded. My boyfriend and I are professional artists.  We were staying at my mother’s house in rural WI for a couple of nights.  We live in Rockford, IL. I have been a Coast to Coast listener for 18 years, but haven't reported a personal sighting before today.;42.806;-89.8537
