Tube shaped craft in door county.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space X SpaceLink satellites? PD));2019-05-26 22:30:00;5 minutes;Tube shaped craft in door county. On Sunday, May 26th, my fiance and I were camping in the tennyson bay campground at Peninsula State Park.  We had been sitting next to the fire for most of the night, staring into the incredibly clear sky.   Around 10:30pm I noticed a tube-like object with lights.  The tube was pitch black, and was slightly illuminated by the 4 lights on the craft.  The 4 lights were evenly spaced and going in a row down the underside of the craft.   The craft was also followed by three smaller lights that were evenly spaced.  I couldn't tell if that was a smaller craft or just lights.  At one point a small super bright light flashed from the object, looking like a shooting star.  This all lasted 5 minutes total.   No sound was emitted, not another aircraft in sight.  It was also very quiet and most campers were asleep in the tent areas near us. ((NUFORC Note:  Space X SpaceLink satellites? PD));45.1155;-87.2064
