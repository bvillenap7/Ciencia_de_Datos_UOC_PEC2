I noticed a shiny slender object stationary that was a cigar shape at fist but in a vertical position. After about 4 to 5 minutes of being stationary, it rocketed off vertically at a high speed. Had a huge vapor trail following it. It was out of sight within a minute or less. I have pictures of it all. One of the pictures of it taking off you can easily see a dark cone shaped object at the head of it.;45.1347;-88.1401
