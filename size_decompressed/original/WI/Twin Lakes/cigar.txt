My brother, husband and I were standing by a bonfire when I looked up towards the sky,(North) and I saw a wide shape in the sky it's color instantly was navy blue, my brother was standing in front of me, and I asked him, do you see that, and he said, as he looked up, yes, by that time the wide shape, turned blue green... aqua blue... as it was decending in the sky...it didn't drop down... it pushed it's way across the sky... and came down between an opening between two trees and disapeared behind them. This was not an airplane, as we saw one shortly after and this was much wider, faster, and closer than an airplane.  We did not hear a crash or see any smoke (as if it crashed), it just disappeared behind the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
