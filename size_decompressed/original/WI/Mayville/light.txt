2 EXTREMELY fast moving objects 20secs. apart taking the exact same path as though they were in a flight pattern.;2011-07-25 22:50:00;Less then 45 secs;2 EXTREMELY fast moving objects, 20 secs. Apart, taking the exact same path as though they were in a flight pattern. I was looking into the southern night sky, as I quite often do, and I saw what had appeared to be a shooting star.  It did not stay lit for more than a second.  This object was small like watching a satellite track through the sky, but at an extremely high rate of speed.  It appeared to be moving at the speed of a shooting star or faster.  It was not falling towards the horizon, but parallel to it. I continued to watch the same portion of the sky that the object passed by and within approximately 20 seconds I saw another object do the same exact thing.  The second object appeared to be in the exact path as the first.  These objects both only stayed lit for a second.  If I would’ve blinked I probably would not have seen one of them and would’ve thought nothing of it, but being that I saw two made me believe that it was more than a shooting star. I believe the objects I saw were beyond the earths atmosphere.  It was like watching a satellite move across the sky, but at an unimaginable speed.  Both objects made a streak of light while lit that made approximately a 15 degree arc.  These objects are the fastest moving objects I have ever viewed in the sky. I’ve seen dead satellites track through the sky before as they blink from the sunlight hitting them while spinning out of control.  I’ve also watched many satellites as they track across the sky.  This is nothing like what I’ve seen before.  I wouldn’t have even thought of reporting this observation, if I had only seen one object, but because I saw another in the same exact path, it struck me as being extremely odd.;43.5031;-88.5415
