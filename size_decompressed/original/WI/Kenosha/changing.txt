Two of my friends and I decided to go down to the beach to smoke.  While we were smoking my friend noticed that out on the lake there was this bright star that looked way larger than any star I've seen.  As I looked at it, the object began to come towards us and that was the moment I realized that this is a ufo.   My other friend, when he saw the ufo as well, bolted out of the scene.  He said that he had never seen anything like that.  The ufo stood in front of my friend and I for 2 minutes or so and the craft would change from white flashing lights to orange and sometimes even blue.  After the lights changed on the craft in front of us, the ship itself shrunk and zoomed off into the distance.  The ship, while it zoomed away, changed shape and the flashing lights on the craft changed to where they actually formed a pattern.!  Almost as if the ufo transformed/disguised itself as a plane-like craft.   I do not know if I will ever see the same ufo again, but now I'll be aware that there are actually extraterrestrials out there!;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
