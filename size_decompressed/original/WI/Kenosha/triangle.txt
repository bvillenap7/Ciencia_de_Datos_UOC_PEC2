There were three blue hazy dots in a form of a triangle.;2012-01-29 22:08:00;7 minutes;There were three blue hazy dots in a form of a triangle. It was about 10:07 pm last night when I looked over the beautiful lake. It was an eerie night and I could hear all the birds and night animals.  I looked at the sky and saw all the amazing stars, when out of the ordinary there seemed to be lights moving. I thought this was an airplane, but as an expert in airplanes I could tell this was not one.  It had three dots, that seemed to be a blue haze in a distinct form of a triangle.  Since I was out on my back porch I had no utensils to take a picture.  I wish I could provide more factual information, but I know what I saw. I saw a UFO.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
