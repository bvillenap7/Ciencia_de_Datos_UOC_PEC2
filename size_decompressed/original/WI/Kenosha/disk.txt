Silver disk.;1973-08-10 14:50:00;15 minutes;Silver disk We were playing outside when I saw what looked like a silver star to the northeast. It was coming closer to where we were and assumed the shape of a disk. It made no sound and appeared to be motionless for a time. It then changed its angle and presented its narrow edge towards and began to climb at a steep angle yet not moving fast. The angle would be like that of an airliner after leaving the runway at take off. It continued to climb and disappeared into a cumulus cloud. At no time did it make a sound we could hear. I don't think it was a balloon because it held its original position against a southwest wind for some time.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
