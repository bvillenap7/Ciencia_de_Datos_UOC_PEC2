Sudden Flash of Light;2012-01-12 22:00:00;1 second;Sudden Flash of Light I was coming home from my gf's house who lived in silver lake.  I was heading east on HWY-50 at night and from behind me a light flashed.  There was no lighting instances in the area and it wasn't a car coming over a hill.   The light lit up roughly 10 acres of land and it was an even lighting which means it happened quickly from one source.   The light was a bright white more LED fashion instead of florecent and had almost a blu-ish tint to it.  I was too startled to look around and observe the scene.
