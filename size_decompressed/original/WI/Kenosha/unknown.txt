Flaming mass or UFO?  I think I know the difference, regardless there was something in the sky.;2012-07-21 12:40:00;45 minutes to 1 hr;Flaming mass or UFO?  I think I know the difference, regardless there was something in the sky. Circular in shape, Initially appearing to be a satellite located directly above the house across the street from mine until quickly it was noticeably traveling as well as hovering.  It descended from high in front of our eyes and we could see it actually hovering in a circular motion with what appeared to be beams of light shining from the object as well as a continuously flashing red light. As it got closer and also traveled in the sky (northbound at this point) after watching it for approx.30 mins as it traveled almost in a triangular-route... a glimpse of it almost made it appear to sparkle/shine as if it was possibly a star or comet.  However as it then continued to travel as well as stop to hover for several moments at a time we began to rule out possibilities.  A plane or helicopter were the first options to rule out obviously, but as we continued to watch this in awe- we considered every possibility including the sky lanterns that people have been known to illegally ignite despite the fact that we knew this object was CLEARLY way higher than any vehicle flown by a person let alone a simple sky lantern.  It continued to descend at a rapid pace and move northward in the sky until the street lights on the corner near where I live made it impossible to watch and it also was after 2 am at that point and I had been monitoring it steadily. My neighbors witnessed but we all are unsure what this object was. Needless to say I did not sleep and will be watching again tonite. I very much would like some answers towards if this was a flaming mass or a UFO although I feel I clearly know that any flaming mass could not travel in the manor of which this object did regardless of how I attempt to rationalize it. At one point I also noticed two lights when it appeared to be moving closer before it began to continue descending and moving northward.. (as it moved east aka towards my house/lake michigan) for the few moments that it did I saw be! ams steadily moving coming from two lights as if the vehicle w! as movin g directly this way, however then the hovering continued on adn off and the red light began to appear/disappear as it hovered in a circular motion while also traveling in the sky.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
