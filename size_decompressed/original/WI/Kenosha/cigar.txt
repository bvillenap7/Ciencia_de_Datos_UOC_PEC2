I stepped outside with coffee around 7:30 a.m., as the weather is much nicer than it has been here for some time.  I always look up as to see cloud cover and chemtrails, etc., to get a gauge on the day.  Blue skies to the right (north) and cumulus cloud cover to the south.   To the north I seen what I first thought was an airplane.  Sipped some coffee, lit a cigarette and checked back on the airplane as it got close enough to see it was whitish silvery and absent of wings, but yet still too far away to be sure of anything.  It was traveling due south and cigar shaped with no noise.   As after about 10 seconds, it got close enough to be sure their were no wings.  It flew into the clouds to the south after about 15 to 20 seconds of being visible in the sky.   It was almost about the size lengthwise of a full moon and I can't really decipher how high it was besides saying it was the height of a low flying plane.  The finish of the object looked like a high polished nickel or aluminum with a white hue to it.   No camera on my persons as the thought came across to take a photo or video, but I remember being glad and at ease that I was not trying to document it besides seeing it.  It actually gave me joy and relaxed as I stared at it and felt odd or hypnotized is for lack of a better way to describe my experience.   In conclusion, cigar object was visible from north sky for 15 to 20 seconds, as it flew into cloud cover to the south in the area code of 53144 at 7:30 a.m. on 03/13/2015.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
I wish to have someone analyze and zoom my photos and video.;2015-04-15 09:30:00;20 minutes;I wish to have someone analyze and zoom my photos and video. From the south I noticed an object in the sky and watched it as it got closer as it seemed a little odd to me.  It almost looked like an airplane but yet not.  As it got closer I seen no wings or tail structure.  Just a white silver cigar shaped object moving slowly through the sky headed north.   About 40 seconds visual then object could no longer be seen.  I was outside with my girlfriend enjoying our morning coffee and we began to discuss the object.   I looked back in the initial direction the object was first seen and another one appeared in exact accordance to the first.   I took out my Iphone 6 and took probably 10 pictures of object.  Pretty much pointing phone to the area and hitting the white circle on phone screen to take the shots.  As I discussed the attempted photography with my new phone with my girlfriend, the third cigar shaped in the exact same flight path appeared and I said I will try the video on the phone.  I have 10 to 20 pictures and at least 1 decent to good video of one of the 5 objects I witnessed this morning of April 15, 2015, around 9:30 a.m.   In summary a total of 5 objects witnessed in total along the exact same flight path going south to north about a minute apart and seen for about 40 seconds each were cigar shaped with a whitish silver hue and possibly segmented in the center but not completely.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
