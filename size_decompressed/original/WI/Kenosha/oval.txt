It kept getting larger as it got closer to my house.  I yelled for my dad to come look and we both watched the craft.   It then started going directly West at one point and as it got over what I assume to be the I-94, it flickered on and off a couple of times then went dark for good.  I used a different date when filing this report as my keyboard won't let me enter eights or fours.   There was NO sound from the craft.   One last note, my dogs were barking like crazy but I'm not sure if that was from the craft or because I yelled for my dad to come look. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above.
