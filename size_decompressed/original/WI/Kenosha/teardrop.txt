Multiple white teardrop shaped lights;2019-09-06 20:50:00;1-2 minutes;Multiple white teardrop shaped lights At about 8:50 pm CST in Kenosha, Wisconsin, I went to take my dog outside.  Looked up into the sky as usual, I thought I saw a searchlight.  Then instantly I noticed there was about six or seven of them.  Almost teardrop shaped.  Moving around in the sky and then they all gathered into one group.  A second later the lights formed a crescent shape in the sky and held that position for about 30 seconds.  At that time I ran in the house, yelled for my husband to get outside right away.  He saw the lights as I did in the crescent shape.  And then they took off in a North, north east direction over Lake Michigan. From the time they started to move after they formed the crescent shape, and weâ€™re gone, was only about a second. There was absolutely no sound at all.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
