Bright object seen moving across the sky shortly before sunset.;2000-10-16 18:10:00;20 seconds;Bright object seen moving across the sky shortly before sunset. I observed an object while taking a cigarette break outside at work.  I was looking westward, the sun had already begun to set behind the horizon. The object appeared in front of a group of clouds in the western sky. As it appeared it was stationary and became very bright, then it appeared to move a short distance southward. It then stopped, faded and disappeared exactly opposite of how it had appeared. There were no flashing lights, no strobes, nothing that that would identify it as an airplane.   I know what airplanes look like, and I've seen a fair share of meteors and this object didn't behave like either. There were no other objects in the sky at the time.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
Stars that move erradically and make trails like meteors.;2000-10-20 21:00:00;5hours;Stars that move erradically and make trails like meteors. Actually this is a typical sighting. ANY clear night in Kenosha County even out my back door I can see at least 3 UFOs moving around. My last sighting was at the Fox River and Highway 50 fishing for Walleyes.  I always see UFOs out there.  There is  an Indian Effigy Mound near there on Highway 83 North of highway 50. It is shaped like a panther and stands for the water spirit. I have had over 200 sightings since 1996 and have seen a big yellow ship come out of the clouds in 1996 in front of my apartment as big as 4 city blocks with my friend and it lit the whole sky up and shot off at 90 degree angle in milliseconds. So sometimes the UFOs just move around a bit or streak off and make trails.  I have seen two UFOs making a U shaped pattern over and over at the Fox River also. I also have been abducted since age 5 and have seen aliens in my room. I still am being abducted and think I being used for genetic experiments and used for sexual purpose for some reason. Thanks!;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
We saw 2 lights over some tree tops in our back yard.;2001-02-17 20:30:00;5 minutes;We saw 2 lights over some tree tops in our back yard. we had a cookout for my father's 50 th birthday and before we lit up the birthday cake, my son ran out side we went after him and we seen that he was looking up at something.

Lights coalesced from the north, flashed red yellow and blue, flew in large circles, and dissapeared again to the north.;2002-05-25 23:15:00;12 mins.;Lights coalesced from the north, flashed red yellow and blue, flew in large circles, and dissapeared again to the north. I was driving home relatively late.  I was to the west of Kenosha near Wind Lake when I first noticed the lights.  I thought they were aurora borealis, very dim and distant, so I stopped to look for minute.  That's when I noted that the light seemed to be moving toward my position.  Within about thirty seconds, what were initially long streaks of light coalesced into three very distinct orbs of varying color.  They shifted from red, to a blinding yellowish/white, to a cool blue.  It did not come very close to the ground, nor did it make any very sharp movements or sound, but it was definitely moving it plotted large concentric circles over an approximate area of 1 square mile.  Then it dimmed and sort of disintegrated.  I've driven that route many times and have seen nothing like it before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

An eerie glowing aircraft with no sound over Kenosha Wisconsin;2008-06-12 11:50:00;2 min;An eerie glowing aircraft with no sound over Kenosha Wisconsin I was just coming home from work.  And I was in a hurry to get into my house because there was lightning just north of me in the next county.   But when I got out of my car.  I caught this glow from the corner of my eye. I turned south toward the glow. It’s color was unusual, like if it were white, red, yellow, and soft and bright all at the same time.  It came closer, very eerily. At an unusual pace. I heard no sound coming from this aircraft.  Just gliding almost felt like it was rising and moving towards me at the same time.  And once it got right above my head, the glow disappeared, and all you saw were about 6 or 7 lights moving in a horizontal diamond shape.  I felt paralyzed with fear but pushed myself to get closer to my house.  The colors of the lights were different and I couldn’t tell what they were, just colors.  And it quietly moved pass with no sound.   Right after it passed.  From the east a commercial plane passed quickly.  I could here the sound from its engine just fine.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
Two red light/balls buzz Waukegan to Kenosha and disappear to the east over Lake Michigan.;2011-07-31 23:00:00;4 minutes;Two red light/balls buzz Waukegan to Kenosha and disappear to the east over Lake Michigan On Sunday night, July 31, 2011, just before 11:00 p.m., my wife and I were seated in chairs, hers facing south, mine north, on the dock in front of our boat at the Kenosha Marina, Lake Michigan, WI. We were generally just appreciating the beautiful evening, and looking at all the bright stars we could see overhead.  Both of us commented on how unusually clear the night sky was. Kenosha underlies takeoff and arrival routes from both Chicago and Milwaukee airports, plus the smaller airports of Waukegan, Kenosha, and Racine.  I personally am an Airline Transport Rated pilot with more than forty years of flying experience in many different types of aircraft, with over 20,000 flight hours, flying corporate jets the past 32 years.  I spend a lot of time watching the sky for aircraft and take pride in how many types I can identify as they pass overhead. Shortly before 11:00 p.m. my wife commented, You should look at this airplane.   I said, I really don’t feel like twisting around to look at another airplane.  She said, You really ought to look at this. I turned around in my chair and looked to the south.  What I saw was a bright red ‘light/bal,l’ low in the sky moving south to north toward us at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude at a high rate of speed.   I jumped up from my chair to get a better view.   In a matter of just maybe 15 seconds, the red ‘light/ball’ grew rapidly larger. This ‘light/ball’ had none of the normal aircraft navigation, strobe, or recognition lights normally found on aircraft. Suddenly, the ‘light/ball’ made a sharp right turn to the east over Lake Michigan and  accelerated at an astonishing rate as it climbed out of sight in to the distance.   The entire time of observation was approximately 45 seconds.   My wife said, What was that?  I said,  have absolutely no idea. I’ve never seen anything like it. Stunned, we both returned to our chairs and sat down.   Shortly, she said, Here comes another one. I jumped up out of the chair, turned around and observed what appeared to be the same type and color object repeat the same maneuver.  I grabbed my cell phone and took two pictures.  One in normal the object appears to be a small bright dot between the sailboat masts.  I then zoomed in max, and as expected it was very shaky/blurry, but the red color of the object is obvious. Because I do not know the size of the objects it is difficult to estimate the distance they were from us.  They appeared to be several miles away.  It was a quiet night, but we heard absolutely no sound from the objects.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111

I saw a bright light in direct Southern sky.  Thought it was a airplane but it wasn't moving in any direction, then i assumed it was a Star although i didnt see any others, and felt it was to bright.   After watching it for 3 to 4 minutes it was gone, just like a bright light bulb being turned off.  I have no idea what it was.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
Four white-yellow lights moving across the sky over Lake Michigan at incredibly fast speeds.;2015-11-02 19:05:00;~2 minutes;Four white-yellow lights moving across the sky over Lake Michigan at incredibly fast speeds. Walking to a beach on Lake Michigan, my companion and I watched as four white-yellow lights flew across the sky.  At first we believed them to be at the bottom of some aircraft, but it was zipping across the night sky at a relatively quick pace.  The lights had a southbound direction.   At some point, the lights moved in such as way that the imaginary craft they were connected to was no longer parallel with the earth (horizontally aligned) but as if it were perpendicular to the earth (vertically aligned).   The lights then converged together.  They began to corkscrew rapid in the night sky before flying off in that corkscrew fashion in a southeastern direction.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
