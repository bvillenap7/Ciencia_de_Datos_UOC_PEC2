Fireball descends and Pops over Kenosha;2011-12-31 19:25:00;3 seconds;Fireball descends and Pops over Kenosha I was heading east on 52nd Street crossing the intersection of Green Bay Road when from the corner of my eye a large fireball descended somewhere between 60th Street and the Baseball field on my right.  When I turned to look at it, it exploded.  But it made a loud pop noise.  Not like an explosion.  And it disappeared.  I attempted to drive in that area and see what it could have been.  But it was too dark.  I know it was not a firework. I have never  seen a firework look like that.  The object if I could guess its size, was half the size of a Volkswagen beetle.;42.5901874074074;-87.852471111111
