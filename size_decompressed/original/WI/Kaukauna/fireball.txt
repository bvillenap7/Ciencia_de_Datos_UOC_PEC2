Strange lights resembling fireballs seen in night sky.;2014-08-08 21:40:00;5 minutes;strange lights resembling fireballs seen in night sky On the evening of August 8, at approximately 9:40 p.m., my daughter was leaving my house, and I followed behind to walk her to her car.  She looked up as she was walking and commented “what’s that?”   I then looked up and saw three bright orange colored lights in the sky with two moving parallel together and another following behind as in a triangular shape.   As we continued to watch what I now call fireballs, I saw four more that seemed to originate from a lower altitude and climb higher following behind the original three lights.   As the lights climbed higher into the almost completely clear blue sky, each one took its turn fading into nothing.  One of the lights seemed to glow longer than the others before finally fading out.   As I watched all of this taking place, my daughter had taken out her cellphone and was videotaping.  The lights are visible on her video, but are not of the intensity that could be seen with the naked eye.   These lights made no sound.;44.2951999999999;-88.2713000000002
2 witnesses saw 7-8 fireballs were flying in formation at 9:40 p.m. near Kaukauna, WI.;2014-08-08 21:40:00;5 minutes;2 witnesses saw 7-8 fireballs were flying in formation at 9:40 p.m. near Kaukauna, WI. At approximately 9:40 p.m. on the northside of Kaukauna, WI, (in the country), as I was going outside to leave my parent’s home, I  saw what appeared initially to be a formation of fireballs slowly moving through the sky.  I describe them as fireballs because they were orange in color and appeared to be glowing.  They were also soundless.   They were much larger than the stars and planets in the sky if I had to estimate I would say they were the size of 10 stars together.   There were two of these objects in the lead side by side and another 5–6 that followed.   My mother and I first saw these objects in the east and they were traveling upward and northwest.  They appeared to be flying at the height of a low flying airplane.   After approximately 1-2 minutes of seeing them, they faded out, once they got to the same point in the sky, except for one near the middle of the formation, which lasted about 40 seconds longer.   The whole experience of seeing these flying objects lasted approximately 4-5 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.  She is a medical professional.  PD));44.2951999999999;-88.2713000000002
