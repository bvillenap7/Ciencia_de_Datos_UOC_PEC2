My wife called me in our bedroom and showed me a strange light in the sky outside our house.  I went outside to see if I could get a video of it, but it wouldn't pick it up.  Pretty weird though it seen get slightly brite then dim down and then repeat that the whole time we watched.  It didn't move from that spot at all.;44.2951999999999;-88.2713000000002
