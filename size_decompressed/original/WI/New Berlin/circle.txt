Orange glowing sphere over New Berlin Wisconsin;2011-07-04 21:30:00;1 minute;Orange glowing sphere over New Berlin Wisconsin We were going to the 4th of July festival and had just parked.   We saw an orange/red sphere rising up slowly as if it were a helicopter and then hover.  It seemed to almost be glowing, but the brightness was pulsating.  While we were observing this a group of people behind us spotted it too.  We were able to watch it for about a full minute when it zoomed off so fast that it disappeared within seconds.  I would guess it was a few miles away.;42.9907253731349;-88.0985206823021
Circle orange light traveling at an high altitude from south to north.;2013-07-04 21:20:00;1 minutes;Circle orange light traveling at an high altitude from south to north Orange circle light about the size of a dime traveling from south to north just west of our position at 9:20 pm.    Appeared at about a 45 degree angle  and also disappeared at a 45 degree angle in the horizon which tells me it was extremely high up, similar to a satellite.   We saw another orange circle light about 35 min. later traveling in the same direction, just east of our position.   Saw 1 more orange circle light about an hour later traveling from SW to NE.  This one went directly over us.  When directly over us it looked like a white dot about the size of a pin point for about 2 seconds then turned orange again.   Each occurrence lasted 45 sec. to a minute. We also saw another on July 5th at 9:23 pm traveling south to north and another on July 6th at roughly 10:00 pm traveling from south to north and turned east just south of our position.  It was clear each night we saw these orange circle lights. No sound was heard either.;42.9907253731349;-88.0985206823021
Large, red-orange, disc moving at steady speed on 5/20.  ((anonymous report));2016-05-20 23:30:00;4 minutes;Large red-orange disc moving at steady speed on 5/20. At 23:30, moon was full.  Two witnesses observing the full moon noticed a large (1cm at arm's length) deep orange-red circle moving slowly and steadily from 270 degrees to 90 degrees.  The lights did not modulate, fade, change or blink.  The object was larger than an aircraft. No noise was noted.  This was in a rural area and noise pollution is minimal visibility is quite good.  The object did not deviate from its course, change speed, appear to move closer or farther away. The transit of the object was too slow to match a typical satellite, was in the wrong part of the sky for solar reflection and was a color that witnesses have not seen on aircraft, meteorites, satellites or any other common phenomena.  The object took no less than 3 minutes to transit 90 degrees of the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
