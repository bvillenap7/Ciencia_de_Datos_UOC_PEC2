4 Red/Orange Triangular shaped lights merge into a single light.;2011-09-18 18:45:00;10 minutes;4 Red/Orange Triangular shaped lights merge into a single light My wife was driving home and turned onto our street and noticed a group of red/orange lights ahead of her in the southern sky.  She pulls into our driveway and watches these lights for a few minutes, not understanding what they could be.   She then runs into the house telling me to come outside.  As soon I get outside, I noticed 5 lights total, 4 red/orange lights forming a triangle, hovering and silent.  The 5th light was a separate object and moving just next to the triangular craft.   My wife said 2 other objects flew off in the first few minutes before I got outside.  I think there were 4 craft total.  I would guess they were less than a mile away, to the southwest and approximately 500-2000 feet altitude.  If you held your hand up to the sky and made a V with your 2 fingers, that's about how big the triangular craft was.   What I noticed about the color of the lights is that technically they were not red/orange.  They were orange one second and red the next.  It would change between the 2 colors but I can see how people would just say reddish orange. My wife kept asking me over and over - Are these UFO's and after about 5 minutes, the 4 lights making up the triangular craft went into a bit a dance for about 2 seconds and formed into a single red and orange light now.  Now there are 2 craft, 2 lights.  Before, it was 5 lights, 2 craft.   Then both lights just started to move again and headed northwest.  In just another minute or 2 , they were gone.;42.9907253731349;-88.0985206823021
Red & white lights in shape of a triange in the sky;2011-09-30 20:00:00;5 minutes;Red & white lights in shape of a triange in the sky I was turning into the Target store parking lot in New Berlin, WI when I looked up over the trees and saw 4 lights in the shape of a triangle.  Three of the lights were red and one was white.  It hovered in the sky, and one of the lights disappeared for a few moments, then reappeared.  At first I thought it was radio towers but then realized that the closest radio towers were in the opposite direction. It was a very curious event.  No airplane behaves in such a manner as what I saw.;42.9907253731349;-88.0985206823021
