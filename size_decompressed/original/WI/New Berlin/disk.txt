Objects were hovering motionless & in an instant vanished. My wife was driving west on Hwy 43 from Milwaukee to New Berlin. She observed three silvery blue objects,each with two orange C-Shaped formations extending from the sides. The three objects were in a trinangular configuration. The report from Mosinee,10/1/98, describes the same type object seen by my wife. She had the objects in view for approx. 7 minutes. The three discs remained motionless for the duration of sighting. She exited the highway still observing the three discs. Her view of the objects was momentarily blocked by trees upon turning onto the road to our home. When her view was unobstructed she looked back for the objects but they had vanished. My five year old daughter also saw the the objects. She asked if they were ghosts in the sky. This sighting visibly scared my wife, who up until this sighting, has never reported seeing any such phenomena.;42.9907253731349;-88.0985206823021
