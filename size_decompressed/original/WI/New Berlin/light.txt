I was walking west at 8:10 ((sic.  p.m.) cst when I observed a very bright, round white light in the northwest sky rapidly descending from 30 degrees above the horizon to disappearing behind the horizon.  The white light was very much brighter than the many stars visible on this clear, crisp night.  The light was also very much brighter than an airplane passing by in the west sky.;42.9907253731349;-88.0985206823021
