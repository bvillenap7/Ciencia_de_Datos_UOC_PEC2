I immediatly noticed what at first appeared to be a very bright star low on the horizon.The object remained stationary and as I approached the definate V-shape became very clear. the object had 4 or 5 white lights on each arm of the V, totalling 8 or 10 lights in all. I travelled approximatly 10 blocks before no longer being able to see it as I passed it. As it was now behind me I continued on to work. This road was very well travelled and I am sure someone else must have seen this also as it was so low as to be the size of my thumbnail with individual light clearly visable.;42.9907253731349;-88.0985206823021
