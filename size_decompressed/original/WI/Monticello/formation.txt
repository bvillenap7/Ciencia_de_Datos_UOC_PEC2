We were making out in a cornfield when we heard a strage humming noice.  We looked around and one of our group spotted a group of lights headed just slightly away from us.  There were about 8 of them and they seemed to be traveling at an astonishingly fast speed that was steadily moving about one hundred feet above us.  Some of the more timid members of our group got scared and we all ran with them south, and away from the lights.  When we were running we could tell by how our shadows had shifted and moved to in front of us (rather than to the left) that they were following us.  We ran and ran as they stayed aproximatly the same distance behind us when we then hid in a cave that was along the side of the rood.  The next day those of us who lived nearby woke up to go to work and found that we must have walked in our sleep and hurt our noses (our pillows had a little blood on them) which we think must have been a psychological effect from taking in the fearsome sight of the UFO.;42.7379;-89.6076
