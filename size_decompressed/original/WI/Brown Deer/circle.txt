It was a round ball, bigger than the object my husband and I saw 2 nights ago. It had a very bright center and a glowing reddish light surrounding the object.  No trail was left.  It moved slowly enough in a straight line that I could go inside and the house to get my binoculars.  It was moving north and seemed to be ascending into the sky getting smaller.  Then, it vanished.;43.1585;-87.9562
