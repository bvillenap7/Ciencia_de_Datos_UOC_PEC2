We looked up to the southeast sky to see Jupiter shining bright and one star to the left.  Then all at once we see what we thought was another star floating in between Jupiter and the other star.  We stood still and watched it getting brighter and bigger coming towards us.  It was diamond in shape with a bright white center and a glowing orangish-red outer diamond light. It zigzagged a couple of inches then came straight towards us and stopped.  It was still up about 1500 feet or higher.  We watched it stay in place for a about 2 minutes.  Then it began to raise backwards between the two star  . It was moving away from us, getting smaller and smaller.  Then it disappeared. We are both in our early 60's, educated and work in good jobs.  We live in a small residential area north of a small metropolitan area.  Neither of us think this is a drone because of its height in the sky.;43.1585;-87.9562
