((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) they said they did not have any excercises in our area. we are approx. 60 miles away from tomah. we are in greenwood. it looked like the glowing orange balls were approx. 10 miles away. i know cause i seen the military flares going off at night from 50 miles away and they look cool but you could tell they are 50 miles away. there is no military base in or around greenwood. i seen them tonight on and off for about 1 hr. thats how long it takes me to get to my apt. in eau claire.  ((NUFORC RESPONSE)) Dear Mr. ((deleted)) I am confused, then.  If the military says they were not military, why do you think...or why did you state earlier...that they are of military origin?   Also, how do you know they are 50 miles away?  Lights in the night sky are very difficult to determine a range to, probably impossible, without triangulation.  Thank you! ((WITNESS RESPONSE)) it was probably military flares. ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the witness observed.  The first possibility to be ruled out, we feel, would be celestial bodies.  We have chosen to post this report, principally because we have received so many other reports of orange or yellow lights in the nighttime sky.  PD));44.7404;-90.6229
