Three objects in outer space formation;2003-08-26 03:30:00;5 minutes;Three objects in outer space formation ************** THE OFFICIAL STORY ************ > > > > The time was 3:30 am on august 26, 2003. I was outside talking to my brother as I noticed three > triangular stars moving across the sky, I had to look > again to make sure, I said look a triangle ufo! my > brother and I both agreed to see if it was one solid > craft or three independent ufo's, we did this by > waiting for the triangle to pass over some stars, but > when it did we seen the stars through the triangle and > knew it was not one craft but three seperate objects. >  also, even though the three objects kept the triangle > formation as it flew from a south west direction to a > north east direction the triangle formation did not > keep true form but shifted out of place somewhat, so > now we knew the objects did not all travel at constant > speeds but varying speeds due to minor formation > breakup. >    after 2-3 minutes I went to my moms bedroom window > and pounded on it for her to wake up! she came outside > and also witnessed these objects. >    I seen tumbling satelites that flash randomly as > they reflect sunlight, I also witnessed low earth > orbit repositioning satelites, and satelites that > flare out due to sunlight reflection, and military > flares,landing lights on planes,meteors,falling > stars,northern lights,space station and shuttle flying > at same time, ect... >    I guess the best way to describe this is three > satelites flying (20,000 mph) in space in triangle > formation with one or two changing speed, but after > approx. 3-5 minutes of viewing phenomonem, triangle > formation remained intact, and none of the objects > passed the other, unlike satelites which keep constant > speed unless they reposition their course. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at the formation of three satellites which are often reported to us, and which are thought to be U. S. Navy satellites, and part of the NOSS ocean-surveillance program.  PD));44.7404;-90.6229
