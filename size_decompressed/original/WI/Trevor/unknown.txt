The shadow was larger than an average single family home and had a defined shape yet the sky was clear and no airplanes were present. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received a number of reports like this one of shadows passing seemingly silently over the ground, with no apparent cause for the shadow from above.  We have invited the witness to keep track of the dates of the events, and submit reports for any future occurrences.  PD));42.5195;-88.1418
