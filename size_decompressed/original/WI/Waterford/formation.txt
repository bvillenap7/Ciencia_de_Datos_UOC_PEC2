Round red orange bright lights several single ones....approximately 10 or so.......formed a big circle formation all evenly spaced between the lights.  After several seconds of the circle formation they started moving out of the circle formation and eventually several at a time flew away.  It was the weirdest thing I have ever seen and probably will ever see.  My mom and daughter were with me and we all saw it.  This happened above our church as we were leaving the parking lot.   After arriving back home at my mom's house we went out on their back deck (this was about 10 minutes later at most).  We saw a flash of light in the sky that looked like cloud lightening......but it was not stormy and we only saw it once.  Not sure if that was related at all.  It just seemed weird after seeing the lights earlier we were very concerned what they were.;42.7593999999999;-88.1967999999999
