Bright colors with shape shifting.;2020-09-05 22:30:00;Several minutes;Bright colors with shape shifting. Object near the moon.  Looking towards to the east.  Object was very colorful.  It seemed to change shape from triangles to thin. Just really bright with lots of colors. You can see it with your own naked eye a glow. Got my binoculars 10x50 power for a closer look. Upon closer observation, I noticed object shape shifting to triangles to skinny to round.  Never seen nothing like that.  Did not look like a drone or satellite. Thank you.;43.0788000000002;-88.2728999999999
