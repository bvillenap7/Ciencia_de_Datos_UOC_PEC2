Huge box-shaped craft with circular light beam.;2013-11-08 19:30:00;1 minute;Huge box-shaped craft with circular light beam Two of us were driving east on Hwy 16 toward I-94 in the Hartland/Pewaukee area when the driver spotted a craft floating through the sky.   He opened the sunroof so I could get a look.  It was a huge rectangular object floating by with tiny red and white lights in the front and back.  No further up than a blimp would be, it was fairly close to the ground and very visible.   As it crossed the freeway overhead going toward the south, there was no sound, vapor trail or any indication of how it was moving.   The strangest part though was the massive circular light beam located in the front of the vessel shining toward the ground.;43.0788000000002;-88.2728999999999
