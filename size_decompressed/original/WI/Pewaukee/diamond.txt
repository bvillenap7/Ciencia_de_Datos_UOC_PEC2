Diamond Shaped UFO Sighting on the Lake;2020-08-30 20:05:00;10 minutes;Diamond Shaped UFO Sighting on the Lake I live on Pewaukee lake and look outside for several hours every afternoon and night but today I noticed something unique in the sky in a diamond shape with multiple color lights.  I was in shock and did not want to miss the scene so I decided not to go inside my home and grab my phone to take pictures or a video.  It was directly hovering over the lake for about 7-10 minutes but high up in the air.  There was only one aircraft in the sky but it was like nothing I have ever seen before and as I said earlier, I always look up in the sky everyday for many hours.;43.0788000000002;-88.2728999999999
