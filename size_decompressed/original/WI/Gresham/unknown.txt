Bright star like object in the north-north east sky,not very high,brightest object in that part of the sky,the full moon is in the south-south east sky twice as high, the object when looked at with 10X50 nikon binoculars, you can clearly see flashing red,green,white lights,flashing very quickly,like a cop car. the object has not move for over an hour, it is still there now, I call alocal abc affliate(wbay ch2, GreenBay wi.) to have them go out a look, and they did, but did not report anything to me,(i called back after the 10pm news cast,,Iguess they where to busy to do much more than send someone out to take a look.) if some one in this area had a telescope set up it could be seen easily.
