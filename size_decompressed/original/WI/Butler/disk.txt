Orange ball video taped  with iPhone flying to lake Michigan.;2014-07-17 18:00:00;2 minutes;orange ball video taped  with iPhone flying to lake Michigan. Me and my girlfriend wrestling a cigarette outside and since we don't smoke around our son we were making funny faces to our son through the screen door when he pointed up and said look airplane!  I didn't hear anything so  I quickly looked up and told him there wasn't one when my girlfriend said look!. There was an Orange ball flying due easy towards Lake Michigan.  It was around a mile up and flew at half the speed of an airplane. It was shaped like a ball but looked like it had some kind of disc shape to it.  The weird thing is it didn't make any noise and got brighter as it went further away.   We have video evidence.;43.1113;-88.0735
