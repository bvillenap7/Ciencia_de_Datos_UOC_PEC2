PD));2016-06-07 21:30:00;45 minutes;It was a circle and the lights were going in all directions then came to the middle as one and started over My husband let the dogs out for the last time before we went to bed, which was 9:30 PM on 6/7.   He was out there for about 5 minutes or so and he called me to come outside and said hurry up.  He said look in the sky, objects were white and they were going in all directions very fast and then meet in the middle and start all over again.  It was really weird.  Never saw anything like that in my life.   We were watching it for about a half hour and it was still going on and then we went in the house.   My husband video taped it on his phone, however when we went to look at it the video was gone, but our voices were there.  No one erased it.  Very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Based on the description by the witness, and based on the duration of the sighting, we suspect that advertising lights may be a possible explanation of the event.
