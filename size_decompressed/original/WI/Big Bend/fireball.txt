I don't know what a ufo looks like what I saw reminded me of a shooting star except this was in our atmosphere like when the space shuttle re enters our atmosphere it had fire all around it. I am not interested in having people contact me or getting junk mail but I thought it was important to let you know what happened this morning. thanks Matt;42.8911;-88.2121
