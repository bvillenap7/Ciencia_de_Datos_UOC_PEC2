Unidentified Lights between Mukwonago & Big Bend, WI.;2013-08-29 22:00:00;~5 minutes;Unidentified Lights between Mukwonago & Big Bend, WI Travelling northeast on Interstate 43 toward Milwaukeee, at 10 PM I observed 6-10 lights in the sky.  They appeared to my left, which would be roughly north of my position on the freeway, between mile markers 45 and 50.  Lights were elevated around 60-70 degrees to the horizontal.  Lights were circular, golden in color with a brown or reddish tint.  No color change.  Did not observe and craft/object, just the lights (too dark).  Given their size, they appeared to be too low to be stars.  Lights appeared to be initially stationary and seemed to be groups of 2-3 lights.  Approximately 1 minute after observing (I am driving on the interstate), they appeared to start moving in a circular pattern without losing or gaining altitude.  Observed for under a minute before losing sight of them (I did not stop the car and I would have to look over my left shoulder to continue to observe.  Car in front of me also slowed down and swerved some - presumed that the driver was also seeing what I did.  I got off at the next exit (50) and attempted to drive back toward the lights on County Rd ES which run parallel to I-43, but did not see them any more.;42.8911;-88.2121
