PD)) Sattelite? See other sighting below. Maybe 4 years ago while star gazing in Wisconsin a friend and I saw exactly the same thing. It was like a star appeared, then grew very bright..brighter then any other star in the sky and then dimmed to roughly the same luminousity as the rest...THEN it began to move in an arc very similiar to other sattelites that we have seen. Constant speed and direct slow path across the sky at a very high altitude. The thing that stumped me was to see it clearly appear and grow brighter while remaining absolutely stationary relative to the other stars visible and then a grow dimmer and THEN start to move in the drifting like unchanging arc across the sky like you see with Sattelites. It was clearly stationary first. Almost as if something entering orbit? Very similiar to many Sattelites I have seen while star gazing with the exception of how it appeared and went from appearing stationary to moving and how it changed brightness.

What appeared to be a star got really big and bright. Then it went back to normal size and slowly moved across the sky heading south until it got too small to see. This thing came out of nowhere grew in size and brightness, then moved and dissapeared. ((NUFORC Note: Iridium satellite? PD));45.0539;-87.1631
