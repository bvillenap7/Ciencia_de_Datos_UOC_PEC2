I was standing outside on my back deck with my dad, when out of no-where a bunch of lights that were brighter than the moon came out and were flying around and they were in some sort of line going in one direction.  The whole time, the sound when something breaks the sound barrier was going, extremely loudly.  Afterwards, there were tons of normal planes flying around in the area.;43.8932;-89.5043
