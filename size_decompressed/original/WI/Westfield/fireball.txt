We ran across the field by our house, following it only for a couple of minutes, and as it got further away, we watched it slowly disappear into the night sky.   As we were running across the field, we tried to get it on film on a cellphone camera (iPhone), but the orange light did not appear. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello, Peter,  Yes, it would have been Wednesday morning, June 10th.  And to be completely honest it may not have been a fireball.  I accidentally clicked that when it just looked like a glowing orange light. ((END ADDENDUM));43.8932;-89.5043
