slow moving 'star' that morphed into incredibly bright series of white lights, then back and disappeared;2000-06-04 21:30:00;2 min.;slow moving 'star' that morphed into incredibly bright series of white lights, then back and disappeared this is a copy/pasted report that i just stumbled across....i saw the same thing but further away, so, as to your notes, now you know at least one other person witnessed this 'craft'...my own notes can be found below theirs...here is their post: Occurred : 6/4/2000 02:00 (Entered as : 06/04/00 02:00) Reported : 6/11/2000 00:21 Posted : 6/21/2000 Location : Milwaukee (South), WI Shape : Disk We saw a bright row of lights in the sky attached to a saucer-shaped craft.

PD)) .....my notes.....i saw this far, far off in the sky, and wouldn't have noticed it at all except i happened to stare at the same area for awhile, and noticed that this 'star' was very slowly moving. i'm not sure of the exact time, but at this point it was quite dim, like a star on it's way out...quite a clever disguise...i had seen this once before about 5 years ago, and pretty much just as soon as i started thinking about how 5 years ago the 'star' turned into an EXTREMELY bright spherical row of lights (stadium lights), this 'star' did the same...these were very obviously seperated lights, not any kind of trail from a shooting star...i've seen plenty of shooting stars when i was younger up north, and this was nothing like those...even though this was very far off in the distance, once the 'star' turned to the bright lights, they were almost blinding....then it just 'hovered' for maybe 20-40 seconds, and it kind of freaked me out, as i got the sensation that whatever it was, be it government, alien or spirit, it felt like i was being watched, and as soon as i thought this it turned back into the 'star' started moving quite fast and just disappeared .....i was letting my dogs out when i saw this.....also, when it shifted appearances, it was like it was 'morphing', like it was actually taking on different properties....i'm surprised not more people noticed it, at least the little while that it was so incredibly bright, but i suppose the majority of city people don't care about nature anymore ((NUFORC Note:  This report is submitted anonymously.
