A silent black triangular object with no lights moved over us as we walked our dog across a school playground.;1988-10-10 18:00:00;10 minutes;A silent black triangular object with no lights moved over us as we walked our dog across a school playground. My husband and I were walking the dog on a clear crisp October night when I looked at the eastern sky and spotted the little dipper. Suddenly I saw a shadow move in front of the little dipper and thought it was a flock of ducks or geese or something. Well I kept looking up at the sky and suddenly out of nowhere moving slowly from the northwest to the southeast right above us was a large black triangular shaped object blotting out the stars as it moved silently along. It eventually disappeared from view in the souteastern night sky. There were no lights and no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Milwaukee-- one winged, silent, brightest lights, huge, 1993;1993-04-04 19:00:00;5 mins;Milwaukee-- one winged, silent, brightest lights, huge, 1993 I was a passenger in a vehicle with three other people (a friend, his brother, his mom, me).  We were traveling from Milwaukee south to Kenosha on a road running parallel and just east of I-94.  We first noticed what we thought was a plane flying very low with extremely bright lights flying directly at us.  The plane took a long time to reach us and eventually we pulled over to witness this flyby.  The three lights were so bright.   We pulled the car over and turned off the engine.  The craft was flying around 100 ft off the ground—amazing.  It was all-white, one winged, no windows, and had to be two stories thick but rounded with slightly swept back wings.  The most amazing part was it made no noise!  It looked like it weighed 300 tons, as big as a passenger jet but much thicker.  Moreover, it was flying no more than 15 mph.  I had a good long look at it 100 feet away.  It flew right along the west side of the road.  By far the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen.   I’ve told the story many times with a response most often of “hm.”  I have yet to look on the site but more people had to see this thing.  It was flying in the direction of the Mitchell airport, so I’ve always wondered if it landed. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

A large triangular ship with a large white light in the center and 3 smaller red lights that made a triangle outside the white light.;1996-10-15 15:00:00;Boy Scouts;A large triangular ship with a large white light in the center and 3 smaller red lights that made a triangle outside the white light. I was the boy scouts in 4th grade.  That night our den leader let us out to release some steam.  I was playing a game outside when I saw what looked like a low flighing plane.  I watched it come closer.  It was strange because it made no noise at all.  It was moving a low speed and as it came over me I saw that had a large white circular light in the center and 3 smaller red lights that made a triangle out side the white light.  The color of the space craft was a black color.  I took my eyes off the ship to see if anyone esle saw it but when I turned around it was gone.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
One dark morning I saw a triangular shaped object with lights and it made no sound just before I pulled out of my driveway.;1999-09-10 05:00:00;2 Min.;One dark morning I saw a triangular shaped object with lights and it made no sound just before I pulled out of my driveway. I was on my way to work one dark Sept. morning. (about 5 am.) I got into my car as usual,sat there for just a minute before putting the keys into the ignition when I just happened to glance up into the sky just in front of me. For a split second I figured it was just an airplane until I realized I was looking at a fairly low flying triangular object with one bright light in the center and clusters of lights on each point of the triangle.I could hardly believe my eyes and remember saying out loud to myselfNo way!! I then recall just how low it actually was flying. It was just above the trees and was making no sound at all. It came out of the south east and curved very gracefully going just in front of the trees in front of my house twards the north west. As it disappeared over the house I quickly started my car up and pulled out of the driveway to see if I could follow it. There was no sign of it any place in the sky!

Tilted Strobing Lights in the Sky... Circular or Triangular Object;2005-10-19 22:45:00;5 minutes;Tilted Strobing Lights in the Sky... Circular or Triangular Object I went out on my porch to have a cigarette.  I was there for about a minute before I noticed the object hanging silently above the treeline.  Out of the corner of my eye, I figured it for a plane, but it didn't move, and that's what got my attention.  It was probably a few blocks away from me, but hanging right above my street.  It was a row of strobing lights, tilted at about 25 or 30 degrees.  The lights strobed very fast, from left to right, emerging from around the side of the object, and disappearing around the other side.  They were mostly white and red, with a few blue strobes near the middle of the object.  The way the lights disappeared made the object appear to be either circular or triangular shaped.  It hung in the air silently for about one minute after I noticed it.  It was still hovering when I ran inside to try and get it on camera.  (I did what I could, but I used the video setting of my digital camera, and it came out very dark, and I don't have the technology to lighten it.)   After I returned, and tried to film it, it began to slowly move southward, down my street it seemed, and then curved to the southeast, out of my view.  It frightened me when I first saw it. Really scared me.  It took awhile for me to realize I could capture it on film.  When I got my camera, I fumbled it around a lot. I was shaken.  I know it was not a plane.  Two planes flew by later, following their normal east to west, or west to east paths that I see all day.  This object was very low in the sky. Probably less than 500 feet above the ground.  It was close enough that I should have heard some sound from an engine.  It was also huge. I can't say how big, but from one end of the strobing lights to the other, it was far bigger than any plane I've seen.  I'm even familiar with the sight of C-130's flying at night, having lived for two years at the Marine Military Academy, right next door to the Confederate Air Force, and an airport that allowed C-130's to practice touching down and lifting off.  This object had a solid row of strobing lights that moved in one direction.  I've seen no plane look like that before. It was not a plane.  It was also not a helicopter.  The only thing it COULD have been, besides being an unknown craft, is a blimp.  Actually, come to think of it, it couldn't have been even that.  A blimp would have blocked out the sky above the lights, and that was not the case.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
I have never seen anything like this before in my life.;2005-10-25 23:00:00;1/2 minute;I have never seen anything like this before in my life. I saw a flying wing. The object, only 1,000 ft. above me had silver rectangles outlining the front edge of the craft.  My first reaction was geese flying but I soon became interested because the formation was perfect.  Geese always has a straggler.  The body of the craft blocked out the stars against the dark, clear sky.  No sound whatsoever.  At 23:26 I saw the second craft.  Smaller than the first, and one of the silver rectangles outlining the front of the craft was missing.  This craft smaller, probably because it was higher up, crossed the sky and made a 45 degree turn to the right. I was amazed to see the second craft.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

((HOAX??))  Triangle ufo gang.;2013-01-14 00:00:00;2 hours;Triangle ufo gang I know for a fact I saw a UFO.  I used to be a skeptic but tonight that changed.  I literally saw this thing with my own eyes and could not believe it.  At first I was driving down 91 past brown deer road heading to Mequan.  I noticed a bright light fixed in the sky.  I approached the bright light thinking it was a street light.  I was wrong I literally stopped my car right up under it and looked up and saw a triangluar craft.  Ten I noticed the craft turned its light of which was located in the center of the craft. That's when I saw the whole body of the craft.  I have never seen anything like this. It appeared the occupants in the craft noticed me.  Because I noticed they started to slowly move the craft. I do a u turn to follow it but it takes off at this point with a high speed faster than any jet, plane or craft I witnesss. I tired to follow it but lost track. Then I drove around hat area to see if I could find it....that's when I saw the sky was practically filled withy these objects there were literally about 10 or or15 of the, some of the, flying around with their bright orange center lights off but they had these police like lights and each were shaped like a triangle.  Ten they would turn their lights on and make a formation wither a triangle or strain line.  They were flying close too where you could look up and literally see the vehicle.
