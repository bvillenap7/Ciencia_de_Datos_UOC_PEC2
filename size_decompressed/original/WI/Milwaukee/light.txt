In the distance near the horizon line between the clouds I witness something I cannot fully explain, nor comprehend.  I saw 4 bright lights that appeared to be large objects, judging by the distance I would sat they were the size of half my 2 bedroom house.   One appeared to be hovering and the others would shoot out from it one by one and sometimes two at a time.  They shot off very quickly disappeared behind the clouds and in a minute or two they were back in the same spot.   It was intelligent but not like any intelligence I have ever witnessed or known on this Earth.   I panicked at a certain point and fled home after maybe twenty minutes?

observation of an orange object in the night sky;1998-10-24 20:15:00;2 minutes;observation of an orange object in the night sky Observed an orange light travelling from the southwest to the northeast in a straight line.  object first appeared as if it was a plane that had taken off towards you with landing lights still on.  however, the light coming from the object was orange and not white light as you have with landing lights.  the vehicle maintained a steady speed and did not do anytype of strange flying, just flew straight.  as the object approached, i was not able to see any red, white or green navigation lights that are on aircraft.  as the object flew overhead, the orange coloring did not disappear as you would expect if the lights were dull landing lights.  as the object passed overhead and continued to fly to the northeast, the object still stayed orange.  as i flew away, i still was not able to see any red, white or green navigation lights, nor strobe lights from the object, it just stayed orange.  there was no trail behind the object like you have with a falling star nor was there a contrail behind the craft.  there was only this one object in the sky.  it should be stated, that the object appeared as if it was a orange colored star in appearance.  again what made this interesting was the color of the object and the lack of any type of navigation lights coming from the craft.  i feel that if this was a normal aircraft, was did i not see the navigation lights from the rear of the object.  also why would the color of the object stay orange. at the time of this incident, there were no other aircraft in the sky, nor was there any sound coming from the craft like a jet engine or sound of a prop aircraft.  i do not know how high the object was, again, it appeared like an aircraft that had taken off and had reached flight altitude.  and if some one wants to say that it was an aircraft that had taken off, i have seen enough landing lights on aircraft coming in and landing and taking off that i can truthfully say, never have i seen orange landing lights before. the observation point was a dark area, with little to no ground ligh! t.  I was on the job at the time and WAS NOT CONSUMING ANYTYPE OF ALCOHOL OR DRUGS.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

traveling light that grows in intensity;2001-06-30 22:50:00;10 seconds;traveling light that grows in intensity As my brother in-law and I were star-gazing in a park, I spotted what I thought was another satellite crossing the sky. I had spotted what I consider a satellite right before this one and watched it until it faded away. As I spotted the second light moving across the sky, I grabbed my brother and turned him towards it. As I did this, the tiny star type light grew in intesity until it was brighter then any other star in the sky. By this time, my brother easily saw it. The light then grew dimmer until it vanished completely. The light traveled approximately the length of my finger at arms length in the sky while it changed intensity. I did not hear anything, and I watched for several minutes after for any other signs but did not see anything else. ((NUFORC Note:  Consistent with an Iridium flare.

Large, bright star-like object with no tail traverses the sky east to west seen through city lights;2003-12-01 18:20:00;2-3 seconds;Large, bright star-like object with no tail traverses the sky east to west seen through city lights My wife and I were traveling west bound on I-94 within the city limits, just east of the Zoo interchange which is around 8-10 miles west of Lake Michigan.  We noticed a broght light moving very fast from east to the west, north-west from overhead to around 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon. It was approximately the size of 3 or 4 stars put together and was whiteish in color.  The city street lights were so bright that I said that it must be low to be seen below the clouds.  Once we got out of the city, we saw the stars come out because the sky was clear so this object had to be very bright to be seen by us through the street lights.  It covered the distance in the sky in 2 seconds and did not leave a trail.  I am familiar with seeing satelites, conventional aircraft, and meteors and this definately was not one of those.  Two other couples at our family get-together saw the object as well.  I am trying to convince them to write a report.  They were also west bound on I-94 when they saw it.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

While waiting for the lights to change on the corner of Lake Drive and Kenwood Blvd, facing south, I noticed in the clear southern sky two star-like objects that were very close together (the one on the right was up higher than the one on the left).  Within seconds of spotting these lights I witnessed the higher of the two flash very brightly, then disappear. Immediately after that the second light began to fall then flashed very brightly and was gone.  - That was it.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
white wavering light;2005-09-02 19:15:00;3 min;At approx. 8:15pm, my husband called in to me to come outside and take a look at a weird white wavering light that was traveling across the sky from the southwest to northeast.  This object had to have been at a very high altitude, because we heard nothing.  We live just outside of downtown Milwaukee and only a few miles from Mitchell international airport.  We hear and see aircraft several times as day this was like nothing we've seen before.  We never would have looked twice if it hadn’t been for the very obvious wavering from side to side that this object was doing.  It is very clear tonight and there were several planes in the area, all with the typical blinking lights, and all at different altitudes at the time we witnessed this.  This object had no blinking lights, which is what attracted my husband to it in the first place. We both watched it travel at a pretty good rate of speed across the sky, and then disappear into the tree line.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

Very large, bright moving searchlight, but no plane or helicopter in sight to be making it.;2010-01-31 06:30:00;4-6 min;Very large, bright moving searchlight, but no plane or helicopter in sight to be making it. My grandfather and I were flying on a plane from Milwaukee and stopping in Atlanta, GA, from there to go to Cancun and on to Cozumel.  It was about 6:30 in the morning, and we had just taken off.  The sky was dark and clear with very few clouds, and it was my second time on an airliner so I was looking out through the window.  As we were passing over a town outside of milwaukee, I noticed a large spotlight passing over a few neighborhoods.  The yards and streets that it passed over were brightly illuminated.  You could see the grass in the fields and chimneys on the rooftops and such as they were being lit up as the light was passing, and you could see the outline of the light.  I looked to see a helicopter or even a plane generating the light but I could not find one.  I told my grandpa to look over and check it out and he said he didn't know what it was either.  I was tempted to ask a flight attendant but noticed they were pretty busy, so I just let it go.  The moon was out and full, but i've never heard of the moon creating such a focused, concentrated light of which I saw. I followed the light up and you could see the light was in a conic, searchlight projection, but nowhere was there anything to be making it.  No tower, plane, or helicopter.  The light seemed to be shining down from about 1-2 hundred feet up.   I followed the light for a good 2-3 minutes and then it dissapeared.  It was sort of making the same path as the plane, except that it had more of a wavy pattern slowly angling away from the plane and it moved very quickly. It came back into sight again shortly after and then it just vanished, like if someone just flipped off the switch.   I don't know if anybody else had seen it, but it was clearly something strange.  If it were being emitted from some sort of aircraft, the plane had amazing stealth technology because the only thing seen was its searchlight.

Ball of light floating in sky near main freeway in Milwaukee.;2010-04-03 05:50:00;90 seconds;Ball of light floating in sky near main freeway in Milwaukee. At approx. 6:50am on April 3rd, I was on my way to work, driving on the freeway 794W to ward Madison.  I was driving past the Marquette University campus, when I noticed a very bright light shining in the still dark sky at about 30 degrees to my left and up slightly. I immediately thought it was an airplane approaching.  I continued to watch it, thinking, “Wow, what a bright light.”  I really was brighter than any plane light I have ever seen.  It was only one color (a yellowish white, not a bluish white).  It was then I thought why is there no flashing?   The light stayed solid the whole time. Then as I kept watching, I waited to see if it would change or get closer or keep going to the side so I could see what sort of plane it was.  But, I was amazed to notice that it never moved. That really startled me, so I really now strained to keep an eye on it for about 30 more seconds…no movement.  As I was driving on the freeway, I had to occasionally divert my eyes back to the road, and at that point I did once again, but when I looked back, the light was gone.  I slowed the car down and scanned the whole sky out my left window.  No lights.  There was nothing at all in the sky. Also, the weather was completely clear.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

His eyes were far apart, black and upturned almond shaped. He didn't have clothes on. As soon as i saw him, he dashed away in a stream of bright white light in a diagonal way up to the corner of the ceiling. It happened fast but i got a very clear image burned into my mind til this day, i will never forget it. It looked like what you would expect, fire in the sky movie type alien. I get the feeling he allowed me to see him. I chose to report it today because i watched fire in the sky this morning and felt compelled to tell about it. Aliens are real, i saw one up close. The date ans time are approximate. It was after midnight in January 2011.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

I live by the airport and I’m sitting in my living room staring outside at the clouds seeing if it was going to rain.  Well, there are a few patches of clouds, but I see two lighted circular almost like a ball.   I grab my wife so she sees what I’m seeing. The one on the right is moving around at a rapid pace flickering then turns reddish pink and disappears.   Then the second object does a j-hook formation and turns pinking red and disappears.   I am not saying it was aliens or anything like that I am saying these balls were too close together in the sky to be airplanes.  They also were too far apart to be an airplane.  And one was stationary and the other was traveling at an absurd rate.   Still have goose bumps from it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Intelligent Light moving very slowly through the sky then disappears from view;2014-04-08 23:15:00;10 minutes;Intelligent Light moving very slowly through the sky then disappears from view Last night I was walking my dog ((dog's name deleted)).  There were a few low lying clouds passing through the area.  I had been pointing a professional strenght laser around the sky at the cloud bottoms.  I looked down to see what my dog was getting herself into and retrained my eyes on the laser pointer.  When I looked up I noticed a very bright light directly next to the laser pointer.  I immediately shut the pointer off thinking it was a plane.  The bright light started to strobe extremly slowly and out of any rhythm.  I've seen before.  The light was just at cloud level and moving much too slow to be a aircraft.   Each time the light got brighter it seemed to become more intense.  The light had gotten so bright it started to feel like it was burning my skin.   After going inside my home I noticed my skin was slightly orange.  The light was strong enough to shine on the pavement around me.  The light moved behind a cloud rather fast and did not return after the cloud had past.  I stayed in the area for several minutes to see if it would come back.  It did not return.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

Saw bright light complete circle around aircraft and then vanish.;2015-07-21 21:55:00;30 seconds;Saw bright light complete circle around aircraft and then vanish. Standing on 2nd floor balcony looking east toward Lake Michigan, which is approximately 7 blocks from my house.  Looked up directly to zenith of night sky when I noticed a single medium bright white light traveling in a northward direction.  The odd thing was 3 planes were in my view, I also live next to General Mitchell Airport, and I knew they were planes due to their flashing FAA lights.   As the UFO neared the plane closest to it, which was traveling south, the object changed its straight course and did a counterclockwise rotation around the airplane and after it completed the circle it seemed to get dimmer until gone.  The plane was estimated to be at 5,000 feet however since I had no clue on the size of the UFO I don't know how high it was.  The funny thing is I used to see the same objects every night (sometimes 19 in one night) every night during the summer of 2008 and until tonight have not witnessed the phenomenon again.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

At approximately 22:00 I was out walking my dog and noticed a very large glowing red orb moving silently above the houses.  It was pretty high up yet moving at a steady pace without a sound.  It was bright red with an amber flickering light in the bottom center.  I though it could have been a Chinese lantern, but it was not moving upward in any way, just from south to north.  Besides that, I feel it was much too large to have been a Chinese lantern. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Unfortunately, they weren't. However, while scanning the night sky around 9:45 PM, I noticed a light directly overhead.  At first, I thought it was a satellite moving quietly, steadily due north.  But then I saw it was blinking on-and-off in one second intervals.  No navigation lights were evident, and the light was not the strobe of a high-flying aircraft.  In fact, two such high-flying jets (headed west) crossed well in front of this object, so it was easy to discern and compare what a strobe looked like at altitude vis-a-vis the unknown object. In terms of illumination, the object/light resembled Saturn in both brightness and magnitude, although the quality of its light was a steady pale white while lit.  There light definitely wasn't a flash like that of a strobe, and it wasn't like the brilliant reflected light of a planet like Jupiter or Saturn.  It had no star-like characteristics, either. Unlike transient satellite flashes, the pulsing remained constant throughout the sighting.  And, unlike a satellite, the object appeared to stop about 30 degrees above the horizon for 15-20 seconds, before heading off in a more northwest direction (a deviation under 10 degrees).  It pulsed steadily until it disappeared from view.  No navigation lights were ever in evidence no contrail no sound no silhouette visible against the sky. The sighting lasted about five minutes.

night guard sees light move behind trees;2021-05-25 21:34:00;3 minutes approx;night guard sees light move behind trees Im a night guard on my watch. I parked my car in the corner of the lot and looked up at the treeline on the low hill that makes up the far side (east) of the lot. Its a suburban area outside of Milwaukee. Im on a commercial lot on the highway,, lots of fast food and strip malls, i think there's residential further back from the road. Its not the middle of nowhere. At first I thought it was someone with a flashlight either on a walk or maybe looking to break into my building. People walk by on the street occasionally sometimes a car drives through but never up on the hill its wooded theres no road or sidewalk up there.  Appearance: the coloring was off for a flashlight,l like a wierd combination of 2 kinds of bulbs. The color was bright white like LED headlights but had an orange halo glow like old streetlights and the glow slightly lit up the immediate trees. The bright white seemed to face one direction at a time but always perfectly angled the same way like it was staring at something constantly while the orange hue was slight but all directions. it was enough to light up trees behind it. I didn't hear it made any sound, though I was in my patrol car with the engine and air on.  Movement: It moved back and forth too fast for anyone on foot and at either end it would abruptly stop, bounce slightly and reverse direction. The path took about 5 seconds to cover maybe 50-100 yards. I'm not sure how far away it was exactly but this is all within maybe 500 yards of me. Theres just not enough room back there to be any further you run into houses. But then it faded back into the trees out of sight, very slowly, about 20 seconds.  I was trying to write it in my log when it reappeared at the edge of the treeline and shot up and down. Then it zipped southeast along the edge of the lot/treeline when it went behind my building and I lost sight. I added that to my log and drove around to see if I could spot it again but there was nothing. I drove around on patrol and saw nothing.  Time stamp: First sighting was 21:34 and lasted less than 2 minutes, second was maybe 30 seconds with maybe 2 minutes in between but I looked away at times. Lost sight clock said 21:37, just before 21:38 I guess. Again I tried writing in the log as accurate as possible but that meant looking away.  Drone possibility: it could possibly been a drone but it would have yo be an incredible skilled pilot to fly between trees at night. The 'spotlight' was fixed perfectly on one spot no matter how it moved except when it faded away. When it disappeared the spotlight dimmed a lot, like 80% of its brightness. I dont know how a drone has a spotlight that can aim so perfectly. It shot up and down too high too fast for a drone it was like a fireworks rocket for 100 ft up then just as fast down, with the 'spotlight' changing angles perfectly to stay on whatever target.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
