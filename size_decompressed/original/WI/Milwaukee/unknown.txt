There were 4 witnesses. Saw 2 lights flying together and noticed erratic flying patterns. Got in car and chased objects for 20 minutes before losing them. A minute or two later one of the objects approached from the west and flew directly over our car which was pulled over to the side of the road. There was no noise at all. This was about 9:00 PM. The object then came to a complete stop about 200-300 yards east of us and started to descend. It hovered for a few minutes maybe only 500-1000 feet altitude. It then ascended and flew off. We could not chase it anymore since there were no roads east of us. Had many more sighting between 1973-1976 in the Milwaukee area. The objects always had a bright white light in front of the craft and a red and green light behind it. Lights would never pulsate and there were no stobe lights. They never made any sound.

Odd long-interval flashing lights surrounding bright star (Jupiter?) at very high altitude for almost an hour.;2005-06-07 00:50:00;about an hour;Odd long-interval flashing lights surrounding bright star (Jupiter?) at very high altitude for almost an hour. I went outside on the patio about ten minutes to one in the morning because it was hot in the house.  The night was clear.  I was facing almost directly west, perhaps a few degrees south also, looking at the stars.  I picked out the Big Dipper, and a very bright star/planet (Jupiter?) south following the arc of the handle at about 45 degrees or a little more up in azimuth.  (There is another group of stars that is like an inverted triangle at a higher azimuth, and Jupiter(?) was straight under the point star of that. I am in the city so only the brightest stars of most constellations are visible.)  As I was wondering if the bright star was a planet or what star, I noticed an odd flash of a light near it.  The object seemed very, very high up in altitude, higher than a plane would normally be, so at first I thought I was seeing a satellite, then two satellites.  The first object I saw did seem to appear at each flash farther to the right (north) to about four fingers' width, but did not continue on beyond that and disappeared at that position. As I watched I noticed that there was another light, and then two more all surrounding Jupiter(?).  Most appeared less than a finger's width from Jupiter(?), but one was out about two fingers' width.  These flashes of light were distinct and quick, not twinkly like stars, and there were no visible clouds.  Either the object I had first seen was moving to all sides of Jupiter(?), or there were several objects, as these flashes would appear at about 11 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 5 o'clock, and 7 o'clock positions around it with no regularity as to which light went on where.  One light seemed to have an interval of about 45 seconds for a few flashes. They did not seem coordinated with each other. The lights were small and contained, not lighting up the sky, just themselves. They were white, and perhaps a little red. They flashed one at a time very quickly on and off again--if I blinked I missed it, which made it hard to pick up a pattern. They stayed off for varying periods.  There was no sound, and no smoke trails. A jet in another part of the sky looked completely different and could be heard as it went on.  The environment was otherwise very quiet except for an occasional car passing on the street in front and a little rustling of leaves in a light breeze. The objects stayed around Jupiter(?) for about an hour or more altogether but seemed harder to see later as Jupiter(?) sank a little to the west.  I could no longer see four. I also looked at other stars in the sky but nothing similar seemed to be happening with them. I could see only the light flashes, not the actual objects making them. This is the first time I have ever seen anything I felt I should report.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
yellow circle that materialized with a small circular craft and then vanished afterwards;2009-10-18 04:00:00;~30 seconds;yellow circle that materialized with a small circular craft and then vanished afterwards I was staying up late playing games. At 4 in the morning my mom wakes up to go to school. Because Milwaukee has laws about parking on certain sides of the street my mom asked me to go check on my brother's car. It was parked on the correct side of the street so I start walking back to the house. As I'm walking back I take a glance at the night sky, always a beautiful sight with the clouds illuminated by the stars and moon in my opinion. I saw something completely different though. About 200 feet up (from what I can estimate) a yellow circle appeared. It was somewhat fuzzy and opaque. When I say appear I mean it slowly materialized, at first, transparent, then getting more solid-like. It also seemed to be flat, so it wasn't a sphere, I don't think. From the middle of this yellow circle a small craft appeared. One moment there was just a yellow circle. The next, the craft was there. It was circle shaped since it was against the yellow circle I couldn't make out many details other than that it was dark in color. The yellow circle then began to fade again just as it had appeared. Growing more transparent aside from more solid. As the yellow circle was fading the small craft began lighting up. I didn't have my glasses so I can only surmise at a few lights that lit up along it. The craft then accelerated suddenly and flew south. It made no noise to accelerate and no noise while in flight. Also, no visible means of flying (no engine exhaust, etc).

Craft with white and red lights hovering and slowly moving SE from Froedert Hospital past State Fair Park;2013-12-12 21:00:00;15 minutes;Craft with white and red lights hovering and slowly moving SE from Froedert Hospital past State Fair Park Traveling west on I-94 from Milwaukee around 9pm, I was on my way to pick up a friend when, nearing Miller Park, I noticed an aircraft hovering above the area around Froedert Hospital.  With two bright white lights connected by smaller red and white blinking lights, I thought it was an airplane at first, except it remained almost completely stationary.  Maybe it was a helicopter, I thought, as I continued on my way to my friend's place, losing sight of it. About 15 minutes later at around 9:15pm, my friend and I were getting back onto I-94 westbound near Miller Park when I spotted the same lights.  By this time, the object had moved and was presently just south of I-94 by about a quarter to a half mile, hovering about 1000 feet above the ground.  As we got closer, we were able to get a better view of it as it hovered above the area just east of Stare Fair Park. There were no discernible wings and it wasn't a helicopter.  There were at least 3 bright white lights and a hale-domed shaped blinking red light which appeared to be in the center.  I couldn't determine the shape-it was night and we were on the freeway, driving fast-but my friend and I both did not recognize it as any aircraft we're familiar with.  If anyone else happened to see the same thing, please post.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
