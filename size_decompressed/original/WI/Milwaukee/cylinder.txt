I went looked outside my window to see if my neighbors car had backfired or it was a gun-shot as usual. As I looked around to see what happened, when I saw a can shaped object that was glowing lightly. What the... were my only words as I shut off my light to get rid of the glare from the window, as I did thisthe object seemed to go on alert as i would say. It kinda moved really fast going left to right about 3 feet at a time. It then gave a low-pitched noise that made the stereo shake like a bass amp was in the room. As it did this, a second but smaller one appeared from the bottom of it. The noise then stopped and it flew up until it was about 40ft. When i saw it, it was about 20ft off the ground. It flew straight up then stopped with little or no slowing down, it went NE and with the other bigger one. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  Describes self as student.
