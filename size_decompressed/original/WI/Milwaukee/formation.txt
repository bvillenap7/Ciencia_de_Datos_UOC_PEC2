Awesome Light Display with Following;1977-07-20 22:30:00;< 5 min;Awesome Light Display with Following On the date of this sighting daytime temperatures reached the mid-90s, the night also warm and as I recall clear.  It was the eighth anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing.  As darkness descended I was chatting over the fence, as it were, with a neighbor who was approaching retirement age we often spoke like this.  Housing in our south-side neighborhood was modest single-family residences on smaller urban lots, with narrow driveways leading from backyard garages to the public street.  Lighting was typical of what one may find in an urban area in the late 1970s, that being mercury vapor street lamps.  I do not know why we each paused in our conversation, what may have attracted our eyes, but we both halted at the same point and looked skyward toward the west, and perhaps 20Â° above the horizon.  The best I may describe what we saw was a small group of intensely colored lights, moving steadily and in formation, east by southeasterly.  As the group of lights approached what would be due southwest of our position, they halted suddenly.  And then the fun began.  The lights no longer remained in formation.  They darted.  Here.  There.  Then there.  Changing position.  Appearing in this part of the southwesterly sky.  Then there.  The rapidity of movement, the intensity with which each craft changed direction, was absolutely startling.  The lights would dart and flash in the sky almost as if wishing to convey a message that could not be readily understood.  Then the sky again was absent of these lights.  For a moment.  They reappeared again in the formation that initially caught my eyes and that of my neighbor.  In formation they resumed the same path at the same rate of speed as when we first observed these and before their awesome light show.  There was no audible sound.  With a modest separation after the formation of lighted objects, we then observed two military jet aircraft on the same path as the formation and following at the same pace.  My neighbor and I looked at each other.  What the heck was that? we both said to the other.  I guess we'll never know.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
line of 4 balls of light three white and one red seen for 10 seconds moving straight across sky;2000-07-24 10:00:00;10 seconds;line of 4 balls of light three white and one red seen for 10 seconds moving straight across sky I was standing in my driveway a few years ago (hence the guessed date) when I looked up and saw the UFO. It was a line of four balls of light.  The first three were white and the last one was red. They were moving across the sky in a southeast direction as I faced to the southwest. They were almost directly overhead at about a 75 degree angle.  They moved together as if connected as one craft and the balls of light were touching like this OOOO.  They didn't blink or anything, just moved in a straight line. I was about 10 at the time and was with my parents and their friends.

FIVE SMALL FLICKERS CAME AND FLICKERED FAST AND THEN CAME TOGETHER AND LEFT.;2003-05-01 02:00:00;2 minutes;FIVE SMALL FLICKERS CAME AND FLICKERED FAST AND THEN CAME TOGETHER AND LEFT. There was a sall white flicker, then another, and another till there where five.  They seemed to have made a box with one craft on the outside moving away.  Then the others followed.  All the other four ones did was flicker at the same half second pace together and then came together in a line and went on the same path as the first one that came and left did.  As they left a blueish color replaced the white light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
ufo's formed a circle over our roof and hovered there for about 11/2 hours;2004-08-21 03:30:00;1 1/2 hours;ufo's formed a circle over our roof and hovered there for about 11/2 hours My son ((name deleted)) and his girlfriend had gone for gas , as they came home they noticed  an odd formation of what they thought were stars over the roof, ((name deleted)) yelled for us to step on the deck and have a look,my husband and I did and It struck me odd that the stars had nevr been in a circle before, we all stared for a bit the one in the middle seemed to flash in a row and the ones around it responded with flashes, each in its turn.As we stood there puzzled my daughter ((name deleted)) and her futer husband came to see what we were talking about and also thought it looked strange. My oldest daughter came out to see what had now gotten us all looking up and as she turned to look around, out of the corner of my eye, i see something streak acrossed the sky heading north , as I watched it another was passing it coming south and I ran for my camera (digital powershotA300) I stepped back onto the deck and notice that 2 of the stars that had formed the circle were now missing, my husband told me it was coming back , as i turned to see it, the second one zipped so fast past it was  a split second. I turned back to the formation and noticed that the 2 emty spots were no longer emty. I took my camera and focused on the middle of  the formation and snapped a few pictures, as i did so, the middle object seemed to lower its self,  the entire formations seemed to shift  from east to west   and stood still again a bit closer. I took a few more shots and all stayed to watch but myself and daughter, we loaded the shots onto the computer and i sketched the formation on my paint program, as i pulled up my photos  I could see only one clear view of what was there and it in no way looked like a normal aircraft or a star, it was boomarang shaped with a row of lights around the outer shape. At one point while looking at the formation, there was a bright flash of red that seemed to go to one of the smaller crafts in the circle.  At 4:30 am all came in to see the picture and to agree on sketch, we all went out to look again and it was completly gone!! we were in the house for only about 60 seconds and all went back to look and found nothing! myself and my son ((name deleted)) kept hearing a high pitched  tone in our ears which kept me up till dawn. Since that night we have all looked to see if we could be wrong, that it may have really been stars and the formation has never been seen since!I should mention that it was mostly clear skys with only a few high shreads of clouds. the sky seemed particularlly filled with stars, since we are in the city, its rare to see it such. This is not our first siting ,but is the only one that left a photo to prove it! If you have any questions feel free to contact me. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested copies of the photos.

There were wierd lights no sound and no explanation.;2005-01-13 04:08:00;20 seconds;There were wierd lights no sound and no explanation. I saw a bluish purple light that pulsated.  It was going kinda slow but then picked up some speed. It headed north.  The object came out of the clouds and then leveled out between 100 and 200 feet.  I didn't see a ship but lights.  It was wierd because the lights were close to me but only the lights were visible.  And there was no sound either.  The lights came and were in an unorginized group.  It's also wierd because I live by the airport and I would think they would have spoted it on radar or saw it.  To my knowledge I'm the only person who saw it, I was out in my backyard;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

3 crafts in a cluster with blinking lights on all 3.;2005-01-13 04:15:00;15 seconds;3 crafts in a cluster with blinking lights on all 3. They were a light blue color. Appx 150 feet above above the ground. All I saw was the crafts flying northeast from my house. There were blinking lights on all 3 of the crafts.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Location: USA Milwaukee WI Lakeshore Park Event: Milwaukee World Music Festival Also Known As Summer fest.;2011-07-09 22:00:00;2 mins;Location: USA Milwaukee WI Lakeshore Park Event: Milwaukee World Music Festival Also Known As Summer fest. Time: July 9 between 2200-2300  While observing night sky for a brief moment, I noticed 3 amber light orbs moving north east over Lake Michigan in a straight line.  The orbs were quiet.  I pointed to two other individuals to look at the orbs.  As soon as I pointed at them the middle orb faded away very slow but still moving at continuous rate of speed toward north east.  We dismissed the orbs as military aircraft however after further discussion it was determined that if they were military aircraft they are part of the next-gen models.  The 3 Amber orbs resembled the 3 orbs observed on March 13 1997 in Phoenix Arizona.   After watching footage developed in 2005 about the Phoenix Lights I was convinced that the Amber orbs of 1997 and the orbs over Lakeshore Park were definitely the same.   Watching the show also convinced me to report.  I almost did not.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
There were like 6-8 orange fireball looking objects forming circles, wavy lines and triangles.;2012-08-25 21:00:00;10-15 minutess;There were like 6-8 orange fireball looking objects forming circles, wavy lines and triangles. while me and my guy were walking back from the gas station I noticed somethings bright in the sky. It was sort of dark outside and there were a few clouds out this night. So while walking past the library they just closed I told my guy lets go back real fast. We went back towards the library parking lot looking northbound and up in the sky was about 6-8 bright orange fireball looking objects forming into a cicle. So we were under a tree and decided to go into the parking lot to get a better view.  What we seen next left us speechless. A few of the objects started to disappear while they were forming into a line that was like waving like a snake. At this moment I counted 4 objects just sitting there waving in the air. Then suddenly one more disappears and theres 3 left. These 3, still in a line formation, started to form a triangle that was rotating counterclockwise. The entire time we were watching these lights they were blinking from dull to bright.  We decided to try and go north to see if it was just someone floating somethng in the air. We cut through the parking lot and next to it was an alley but at the beginning of the alley theres a huge house with big trees there. While were walking the object starts to proceed northbound but at a slow rate of speed and then we lose sight behind the tree. I continue down the alley a couple steps as my guy stops and I see the bright light but this time theres only 1 and its starting to gain a little speed as I was following it. Then i just decided to stop and go back home. I had my phone with me but couldn't take a video because I was to shocked at what was happening in the sky for those 10 or 15 minutes.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Sighting in Milwaukee?;2016-06-07 21:30:00;Hour;Sighting in Milwaukee? I am seeing bright lights in formation in the sky.  The sky is very cloudy in some areas can only see when pass through the clouds not when reach the clear sky.  Moving very fast they are circling through the cloud spread out in an open formation each will make like a circular motion in their separate area then speedily move inward touch for a very brief second then spread out again.  Circle around as individuals then speed to the center again where all four touch.  They are moving very very fast can compare to airplane that can be seen not to far away.  These lights are much faster covering a vast amount of space.  Hypnotic in their movement almost looks like they are playing and tracing the clouds.  The objects appeared as large round balls of light that could be seen through the clouds very bright yet could not be seen when reached clear night sky areas at first but after about 35 minutes could see two of them in night sky also.  Seemed very patterned mov! ement and purposeful.  Don't know if others saw also.  I did video but have not watched yet to see how turned out.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
