Large bright orange/red ball over Milwaukee that slowly disappeard;1990-07-08 00:10:00;1 minute;Large bright orange/red ball over Milwaukee that slowly disappeard Over the greater Milwaukee area (center of Milwaukee).   A large, slow moving fiery ball it was very large and bright as it approached then it sloped to the left and became smaller and the fire ball started to slowly become smaller and dimmer until it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  The date may be flawed.  We wonder whether the date indicated by the witness might be flawed.  We have sent him a note, inquiring whether the sighting was on July 8th, or whether it might have been in the year 2011.  PD));43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Fireball in Milwaukee;1995-11-15 19:30:00;15 seconds?;Fireball in Milwaukee I was working in a building near downtown Milwaukee early one evening, when I happened to glance out the window and see a fireball moving across the sky, (parallel to the ground)  at  what seemed a very low altitude (perhaps less than 300ft.) and at what seemed to me to be a very slow speed (slower than a typical small plane).  There was no sound Its path was from ESE to WNW. It disappeared beyond some buildings that were across the river form my vantage point. I told a co-worker that I thought that I had just seen a plane about to crash. However, it didn't look like a plane, and  there never were news reports about the object. If anyone else recalls having seen what I saw, I would really like to know. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in November 1995 is approximate.  We will ask the witness to try to identify the precise date, since there was a very dramatic sighting over the entire east coast during this month.  PD));43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

2 Orange/Amber Fireballs fly by Milwaukee, above Lake Michigan.;2012-06-17 21:27:00;1 minute;2 Orange/Amber Fireballs fly by Milwaukee, above Lake Michigan. Parked on E. Kenilworth Place in Milwaukee, WI, facing SouthEast. Noticed two orange/amber fireballs traveling over Lake Michigan in a Northern Direction. Wind Direction unknown.  Two Fireballs flew across my field of vision until line of sight was blocked by buildings on opposite side of the road.  Distance from objects was unknown, so rate of travel was hard to judge, but was moving faster than a plane, but slower than debris entering atmosphere.  Have 1 photo and 1 (10 second) video taken from a cellphone that shows only one of the two mysterious lights (the other left line of sight before camera was ready).;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Silent group of 12-15 glowing orange orbs of light appear one at a time over horizon and flying in a spread out cluster NW to SWW;2012-08-19 22:20:00;10 minutes;Silent group of 12-15 glowing orange orbs of light appear one at a time over horizon and flying in a spread out cluster NW to SWW I was sitting at a bus stop across from a Domino's waiting 15 minutes for my Pizza playing Angry Birds on my cell phone. I put the cell away and was just about to cross back over the street to pick up my Pizza when out from behind a cloud to my right I suddenly saw a bright orange burst of light that was so bright it could not be ignored. One orange burning/glowing ball light in the night sky is one thing, but suddenly I saw another, and yet another trailing behind it. I could not believe what I was seeing and before I knew it on the horizon I was seeing them pop up to the North & just West and follow a similar path NW to SW almost as if in a non-linear string formation.  During this time I called my girlfriend who was at our house 6 blocks away and yelled at her to go outside and look up while I frantically tried to snap photographs on my cellphone to no avail due to the overbearing light from street lamps. When I first saw them I thought it could be a meteor, but after the first two and then seeing how fluidly they were moving, with small adjustments in elevation I knew they couldn't be as it wasn't burning up or crashing or dissapating.   Then I thought could be a helicopter, but they were SO bright and 100% SILENT & did not move like helicopters. There were planes in the sky as well during and after the sighting (Milwaukee County Airport traffic) but these lights neither came from the Airport nor headed toward the airport and were way too bright and obvious to be planes or anything else that uses the Airport Terminals. I stayed on the phone with my girlfriend until I had walked the 6 blocks home and by the time I had gotten there all the remaining UFOs were gone, however she had seen them as well, albeit not as many - she ended up seeing 5-7 & even noted that one seemed to turn it's light off and she got sight of the actual shape of the object as seen on the face of a cloud, which was round / spherical - as she put it &quota! lmost 2 spheres in one&quot. I only lost sight of the remaini! ng 3 &qu otfireball&quot orbs that I could still see from my perspective once I got about 2 blocks from home and they seemed to have changed direction and were all now traveling more decidedly west than Southwest, however still had a slightly southern trajectory as well. When the sighting was said and done I had seen a &quotfleet&quot of these lights - about 12-15 very strong & bright glowing orange orbs moving across the Milwaukee night sky over Milwaukee's East Side near the University of Milwaukee Wisconsin. I lost sight of the remaining objects the same way I lost sight of the first 8 or 9... as they flew south past my point of view, they headed hard west & disappeared into cloud cover at this point. You could see them climbing up into the clouds quickly once they reached them and fading out of view in less than a minute. These objects were completely silent, very bright, seemingly moving as a large group / unit but with their own variances & at least 5-10 orb lengths between! each object. I felt calm, dumbfounded and not really frantic quite frankly but rather at ease. I remember that my only concern was that my girlfriend who was only a few blocks away get outside and confirm what I was seeing from that perspective as well (looking south as I was seeing them come from the north), so I was ecstatic when she answered and when I heard her reaction over the phone when she looked up. I had a feeling in my chest, slightly emotional and my eyes were wired open as well as a feeling of calm.

Three orange orbs flying west in the sky in Milwaukee, WI on 9/10/2013.;2013-09-10 23:00:00;1 minute;Three orange orbs flying west in the sky in Milwaukee, WI on 9/10/2013. Three separate orange objects seen in the sky on September 10, 2013 at about 11:00pm in Milwaukee, WI. My friend, who doesn’t believe in UFO’s, had gone out to her car and saw 3 orange lights flying in the sky.  The lights appear white on the video, and are actually closer than it seems.  They moved in a westerly direction, without sound, and then just disappeared. They fly above her about half way through the video. She doesn’t “believe” in UFO’s, but was wondering if there is a logical explanation for these 3 separate orange glowing orbs to have been in the sky at this time.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

As I was getting ready for bed this past Sat night/Sun morning, I looked out my bedroom window at the city and the moon in the SW. I saw a moving light from the west, past the Potawatomi Hotel, maybe as far as Miller Park, and thought it might be a plane coming in.  Then there were more lights that came bobbing in, maybe a few hundred feet up and around ¼ mile away.  At one point, there were up to 12 of them, each one of them had one light. My thought was that they were drones, but with lights?  Or maybe gyrocopters.  No sound.  I finally thought to grab my cellphone and took a photo in which 7 lights can be seen.  They seemed to gather above the 100 East Wisconsin building.  Then they turned south, ascended and disappeared without a sound. ((NUFORC Note:  High-quality photo shows a cluster of at least seven small objects in the nighttime sky.  PD));43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

Fireball, Lake Michigan, Milwaukee.;2016-02-01 18:30:00;4 seconds;Fireball, Lake Michigan, Milwaukee. So, I am walking home from the gym, heading east on Wells St. towards Lake Michigan and I just so happened to be looking up at the sky.  There was a very bright object in the sky, with long very bright tail (kind of what what Hollywood would portray as a meteor or a comet....or even some rocket/missle) that was traveling in a downward trajectory.   Some random stranger was walking next to me and I said do you see that!  Unfortunately, they were too busy looking at their phone, and by the time I got their attention, it was gone.  I can tell you with 100% confidence that was no way a shooting star or a plane.  It was way too big to be a shooting star and way too bright and fast to be a plane.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
