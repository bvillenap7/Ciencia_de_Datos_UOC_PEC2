Bluish Orb Seen Above Milwaukee, WI on Wednesday 10/20/99;1999-10-20 22:30:00;6-8 seconds;Bluish Orb Seen Above Milwaukee, WI on Wednesday 10/20/99 I witnessed a hazy bluish orb fairly high in a crystal clear sky traveling S to N then veering NW and fading at approximately 10:30 or 10:45 CST on Locust Avenue while facing the Western sky. My view was unobstructed. All other lights in the sky were pinpoint sharp except for this almost aquamarine colored spherical orb. It was hazy while plane lights nearby and stars were sharp. The orb which caught my attention in my vertical peripheral vision was only seen by me for between 6 to 8 seconds. Perhaps if I had been looking at the sky initially I might have had a longer viewing time.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Four spheres witnessed by two people......5-10K feet in the air.;2006-07-11 15:00:00;2 minutes;Four spheres witnessed by two people......5-10K feet in the air. This event occurred during Bastille Days in Milwaukee, Wi., July 2006.  We went to the festivle on Sat.. The Blue Angles were there on both Sat and Sun.  The next day, Sunday, My girlfriend I were at her Mothers house with the dogs in the front yard. Side note, I was a stinger missile gunner in the Army and ever since then, I have a habit of looking in the sky/air.  I was trained to look and observe and identify aircraft.  Since then, I tend to look upward often and try to challenge myself to identify aircraft whenever possible. This day however had a very high overcast.  I would guess 5-10 thousand feet.  We were  in her Mothers front yard playing with the dogs.  I happened to look up and noticed  a single sphere silhouetted against the backdrop of the overcast skyline.  I quickly called for my girlfriend to come over and see it as well.  As we stood there watching the ONE sphere/round object silhouette against the background of the overcast sky, suddenly a second sphere/round object appeared, then an other sphere/round object, then finally a fourth.   All were perfectly aligned and all where exact same size/symmetric.  Within less than one minute they suddenly simply streaked off or more accurately, just disappeared. This is what the looked like once all four came together: (although they almost perfectly blended in with the skyline/clouds).  I’m simply trying to point out the symmetry and alignment of the way they appeared. Thank you,  US Citizen;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Reaccuring semi-stationary, color alternation spheres;2006-10-03 03:30:00;1 hour;Reaccuring semi-stationary, color alternation spheres This is the second time I've seen these craft. They seem to be stationed all around and so easily visible. They around. I would imagine a gunmetal color with lights of some kind all around their middles...like a belt. The lights alternate colors, not quite blinking but moving in a rythm the way the signs at movie theaters and similar places do. They alternate colors, similar to the way a projector does, like at the movie theater. They are somewhat stationary, moving usually only in one direction (up) and very slowly. They are visible on clear nights. I have watched many airplanes fly around in the sky and also have watched many many stars. They are not either and that is what I am positive about. The difference between these and a twinkling star is drastic. I have not seen any other accounts of these things, so I'm guessing they are fairly new. They're so obvious that there should be others. I know that I am not the only one that has seen them. My significant other has seen them before too. Both times i have seen them there's one that is low and then two more adjacent to it higher up. The last time I watched them I could see more than three. They are odd and intriguing. What purpose do they serve.. they're not there for nothing. : (;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Observed 13 different orange/red spheres moving quietly in small groups, east to west, in a dark night sky.;2015-07-11 21:45:00;15-20 minutes;Observed 13 different orange/red spheres moving quietly in small groups, east to west, in a dark night sky. A band I work with had just finished performing at a downtown outdoor festival.  I was standing behind the stage area, talking with a musician, facing toward Lake Michigan, which was about 4 blocks away.   I saw 4 reddish-orange spheres, moving slowly in the night sky, as if in unison, from the lake vicinity toward land, coming our direction.  I showed the musician and he was captivated, like me, as we watched.  They slowly disappeared behind a tall building.   We wondered what we had seen, and then he said, “Look, there’s another.”  As another appeared on the horizon, soon there were 2 more.  That group of 3 spheres, or orbs, same color, moved the same general direction, quietly, again in unison and moved behind the same tall building til we could not see them.   Again the sky was dark and we watched as slowly a group of 5 more appeared, moving the same general direction, slowing, as if in unison.   Last, 2 more appeared and did the same thing, always moving slowing, ea! st to west, but disappearing. I got a few photos.   I’m very aware of the night sky, and my surroundings and have never seen anything like this neither had the musician who watched as long as I did, a total time of about 15 minutes.  Never have seen anything I'd call a UFO, until this.  Info. about witnesses: adult female, college grad, school teacher for 35+ years adult male, musician/keyboard player, highly respected in the community for many years.  We are just casual acquaintances.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
