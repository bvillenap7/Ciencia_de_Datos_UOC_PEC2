Objects moved;1998-03-27 20:40:00;10 minutes;Light spotted moving very fast heading NE and quickly turning W. Other simular round lights seen w/ same characteristics. Objects moved to fast and silently to be planes. Myself and two friends witnessed a strange light moving North East very fast. The object was moving very quietly. It then turned very sharply twards the West. About a minute later we witnessed another object, which seemed to come out of nowhere heading North East. It was also moving fast and quietly. It turned sharply to the North and quickly faded. Another minute later we saw a light come from the North and quickly turn East a fade like the other lights. About 30 seconds later we saw another quickly moving object come from the North West and then fade. I am 13 and my friends are 13 and 14. I hope you won't use that against us. There usually aren't many planes around.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
A large Red dot floating above the horizon and one or two small red dots zooming up after it;2001-02-06 20:30:00;4 minutes;A large Red dot floating above the horizon and one or two small red dots zooming up after it At about 8:30, my mom called me into the living room to see a bright red light floating High above the horizon.  I did not get there in time to see it but my mom describes it as about the size and briliance of a light on a radio tower, but not strobing.  The object had apparently zoomed off into the distance before I got into the room.  My mom and I then sat at the front window looking for this thing, when I saw a small red dot rise above the trees, move a small bit to the left, and then zoom upwards on an angle at incredible speed.  I went outside to check to see if I could still see it, but by that time it was gone.  I came back upstairs and looked out the window again, where I could see a small pin prick of red light floating in the distance.  I am positive it wasn't a star becase it was moving side to side in an ovular motion. I then went back outside, but still couldn't see anything.  That was the last time I saw it.  My mom didn't see anything that I saw.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Very loud noise and bright light;2001-03-13 23:00:00;10-20 minutes;Very loud noise and bright light 11:00 PM  I work at home in my basement.  Went upstairs to get a snack & watch a little Jay Leno.  Got ready to go downstairs.  Heard a rumbling noise that made me curious but had lots of computer work to do so I didn't go outside to investigate. I work at my computer with ear phones listening to music.  Vaguely aware that the rumbling noise was louder and vibrating the house.   My wife was helping our youngest son with his homework.  They were on the 2nd floor.  My wife called me on the phone and said I should come up and figure out what was making noise.   By the time I came up stairs the noise suddenly stopped.  My 15 yr old daughter came out of her bedroom where she had just turned out the lights to go to bed.  The noise was so loud that she thought she would look our her window.  She said Holy S**t I think I just saw a meteor.  She described a light as big as a basket ball twice the heighth of trees flash accross the sky.   As soon as she saw the light the noice stopped abruptly.  My wife's ears were hurting because of the loud noise.  She had the sensation that it was passing slowly over our house from a SW to NE direction. The next day I talked to several neighbors who all reported hearing the loud sound.  One of our neighbors looked out the door and didn't see anything but said the sound was deafening and frightened her shaking the whole house.   Another neighbor said she went all the way out to her drive way and looked up in the sky (clear night) and saw no lights but couldn't figure out what was making such a loud noise (like a squadron of jumbo jets.)   Two weeks later I talked to a friend about the noise and him and his wife said they heard something just like I described on that same night.  My friend lives about 5 miles SW of where I live. I called the airport.  They said they were testing engines at about that time. But I hear them testing engines all the time.  Seldom more than 2 or 3 minutes at a time. Since Mitchel international airport is 3 miles away the sound never is very loud.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Glowing object on Milwaukee's lakefront;2005-10-17 18:05:00;<1 second;Glowing object on Milwaukee's lakefront I am emailing a photo of this object.   I was taking pictures of the fall colors at the Lake Michigan lakefront in Milwaukee with my Sony Digital camera from my apartment window on 10/17/05.  When I looked at the photo, I saw a white spot in the right center of the picture, which I first assumed was a reflection or flaw in the memory chip.  Upon closer inspection, I thought it could have been a lighted glowing object racing across the lakefront at a very high speed - which would not have been seen by the naked eye, but was captured by the very fast shutter speed of the camera.  It appears to be heading east to west, leaving a small trail of light in its wake, similar to a jet exhaust.  I took numerous other photos of the same area under similar conditions that night and some days later, but could not reproduce the object, whatever it is.   There was a full moon that night, but I don't know what time it rose or set.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
At  11:00 PM lighting struck a silent, unlight craft and then started to glow a brilliant yellow illumination and flout across the sky;2008-05-25 23:05:00;2 minutes;At  11:00 PM lighting struck a silent, unlight craft and then started to glow a brilliant yellow illumination and flout across the sky I was watching the sky to my south observing a lighting storm/thunderstorm.  I saw a bolt of lighting come across the sky from west to east.  In its path the lighting hit an unidentified object that had no lights or markers on it.  The lighting did not continue across the sky, it went straight down after hitting this object.  the object looked to be a circular long object.  The object was a mile or two away at the point of impact.  It moved across the sky faster than a plane and as light as a feather.  It looked as though this object was slowly declining out of the sky.  It was a neon yellow glowing haze/aura/light after the lighting hit it.  It was just at the lower level of the cloud line(Few thousand feet).  As it passed directly over my head it made no sound at all.  At this point there was no thunder or rain to dampen the sound of a plane.  Several minutes after the object had passed a plane had flown by at a similar level and not directly over my head, and it made normal airplane noise.  The plane had several lights on it(like the F.A.A. requires), as the U.F.O. only had one light that glowed on and almost off but still bright enough to see.

They were coming from the west and going to the east.   I have never seen anything like it before.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Traveling star moving erratically across the sky.;2014-08-23 22:00:00;45 minutes;Traveling star moving erratically across the sky. Looked like a star at first glance, then it started moving erratically across the sky. First it was above my dads house then moved to above the garage and then back over to my dads house.   The neighbor even came out and had no explanation herself;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

Light seen zipping across trail with very loud noise after it.;2019-11-10 21:50:00;2 seconds;Light seen zipping across trail with very loud noise after it. Me and my 2 friends were walking on a trail by the river in Milwaukee and about 75 feet away from us we saw a large green light shoot across the trees horizontally and then made a very loud noise. My two friends saw the light while it was green going onto the path and I saw the light as orange as it went into the woods on the other side of the path and right after there was a very loud zipping noise. This only lasted for about 2 seconds but we were all very scared and ran as fast as we could. We can't think of anything that it could be.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Large bright light in the western sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2020-03-15 19:35:00;18 minutes;Large bright light in the western sky Noticed a bright yellow light to the west.  It was about half way up from the horizon.  The light was stationary.  Filmed the object for around 2 1/2 minutes.  Watched the object for around 20 minutes and it didn't move or not change in any way.  I proceeded to unload my fishing gear.  Periodically looking at the light and seeing no change in it's placement or brightness.  Approximately one hour had passed and the light was gone.  Just gone and I know that it wasn't a planet or an airplane.  Something that bright and big should have an explanation.  Very bizarre.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
