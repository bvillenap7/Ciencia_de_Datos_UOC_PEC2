My co-pilot and I witnessed a very intense light, so bright it was a light blue in color move from directly overhead our aircraft, north bound over the northern horizon.  There was absolutely no tail assoicated with this craft.  In addition the size was that of a pea.  It traveled slightly slower than a speed of a meteor, but faster than a satelite.  The two of us observed the object.  It was so bright you could even see it pass in front of a vivid northern light display. See above.  That is all I can tell you at this time.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852

Myself and a few people stopped this morning and saw a round silver object with bright white lights under the round rim. It stayed floating in one area for about 5 minutes and just zoomed off at the speed of light to the east. There was a citing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I would like to remain anonymous.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Oval space craft?;2016-07-01 13:00:00;1 minute;Oval space craft? My daughter passed this along to me.  It was taken by her boyfriend in Milwaukee on South 27th Street.   It appears that he was taking pictures of the clouds and when he was looking though his pictures, he zoomed in on the spot in this one and saw this.   Let's figure this out together. ((NUFORC NOTE:  We can't be certain, but it looks like a hole in thin cirrus cloud, caused by an airliner passing through it.  Just a guess.  PD));43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
