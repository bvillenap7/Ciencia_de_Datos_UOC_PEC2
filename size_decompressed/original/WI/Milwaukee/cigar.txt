I saw what appeared to be a meteorite because it made a pronounced streak as it entered the atmosphere.  A moment later, a very small object appeared in my sight.  At the same time this object came into view I heard a sound from it.  The sound was of a very high frequency--a very high pitch unlike I had ever heard before.  But the sound was only heard when it first appeared and then ceased to make any sound.  The object then moved from the east to the west quite swiftly.  It moved in a zig-zag like fashion across the sky directly overhead to the western horizon and then disappeared.  To view the object required strict attention on part of the observer.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
white, cigar or cylinder shaped object against the bright blue Northwest sky;2004-06-25 12:30:00;2-4 seconds;Around 12:30pm Friday afternoon, while sitting in my parked car I caught a glipmse this white, cigar or cylinder shaped object against the bright blue Northwest sky.  It was definately too small to be an airplane at the low altitude it looked to be at, and what really caught my attention was how fast it was traveling and the fact that it changed position in the sky as it traveled through a low-hanging cloud, then dissapeared behind some trees (total viewing time was 2-4 seconds).  I drove up the block to see if it was maybe a plane, and I then I could explain what I saw but I was not able to view anything in the sky.  Another wierd aspect is the direction in which it was traveling, it traveled from east to west in a slight downward motion, I live about 20-25 miles northwest of the airport and we have planes travel over this area all the time, but I have never ever seen anything that looked like, or traveled like that in anyway. The next day, Saturday, I was telling my dad, who lives in the same area, what I had seen and he was totally shocked because he said that he actually seen something earlier that morning (Saturday) that was almost exactly what I had described...  Whatever we saw was wierd. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD));43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Slow moving glowing cylinder, yet flat on bottom, going east with white light a third way back.;2012-10-27 22:00:00;5 seconds;Slow moving glowing cylinder, yet flat on bottom, going east with white light a third way back. Cigar shaped UFO siting, 10/27/2012, Milwaukee, WI.  As I was going out on Saturday, 10/27/2012, sometime between 9-10 pm, to see a band in Milwaukee, WI, on  Halloween (also Sandy storm) weekend, I noticed a large cigar shaped illuminated cylinder, floating very high up, going west to east directly above my house located a few miles north of I-94, 5 miles west of downtown.  The diameter to length ratio was about 1:8. It was misty, with clouds, yet I could see the object fairly well, traveling similar or slower than a typical aircraft. While mainly cylindrical, it seemed to have a flat bottom, was glowing, but most distinctly had a white light on the side about a third of the way back, and overall seemed brighter near the rear.  A friend in the Kickapoo Valley in SW Wisconsin, also mentioned seeing the same craft earlier that night traveling west to east. Ironically, earlier that day, I dropped off information of my first UFO sighting in the NY Hudson Valley in 1985 (could not recall the specific date, but was mild day in the spring, summer or early fall before dusk) to a local Milwaukee MUFON contact.  He provided me two forms in 2008, and I finally wanted to get them back to him.  I am not sure if he believed my sighting of the saucer shaped UFO, and/or actually processed the information I provided.  While searching online, I found a website describing a similar situation that may have been the person that I met during my siting, who drove up in a maroon van, from the east and turned south onto the road in front of my house, who said he had been tracking same craft for 40 minutes. Additionally, I saw online that similar Cigar shaped sightings happened a week before on Oct 15, 2012,  in Huntsville, AL, and TN, Oct 16 in Pike, Kentucky, during the day,  ((Male's name deleted)) photographed a translucent cylinder, with two lights on side a third of the way back, using a camera on a telescope, Oct 17 in Virginia, and Oct 18 in Gardiner, NY, equal distance apart over the 4 day time span. Also, a few years later, I was on the Coast to Coast radio show and spoke with guest John Lear.   I have a ((degrees deleted)) in Engineering, worked for ((major corporation)) 9 years and was a brewing consultant/ brewer for over ten years.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Two pitch white cylinders flying close to the moon in daylight.;2013-11-13 16:15:00;1-2 minutes;Two pitch white cylinders flying close to the moon in daylight. The date was the same as I write this.  November 13th, 2013.  It was approximately 4:15 PM and the sun was setting.  It was still very light outside even though the sun just started to set.  I was on my way to my grandmothers apartment same as I do almost every week to help her out with sme household stuff and just to talk and visit.  Normally I would have used public transportation to get there completely however due to construction I had to walk the last had mile there.  Her apartment building is right across from Lake Michigan, I don't feel comfortable being anymore specific.  As I was walking down the street I looked out over the lake like usual to enjoy the view.  As I was looking I noticed as usual some planes going over.  Then, I saw this white object very close to the moon.  It drew my attention because it made no sound and had no exhaust trail behind it.  As I began to look closer I noticed it had no wings, or appeared not too.  This made me think it was one of those new drones police departments are using to monitor their districts.  So, I wanted to get a better look.  I hurried across the street to get a better view.  When I did I saw another pitch white cylinder shaped object also close to the moon moving in the sky.  I felt mesmerized.  I couldn't stop staring.  Once I saw th both I knew they were drones or planes or anything I've ever seen.  I couldn't look away.  I heard cars driving by past me but everything felt like it slowed down.  I experience a surge of fear and adrenaline.  I stared at them moving slowly towards each other.  The moon seemed to be in the middle point between them.  When they got close to the moon they just disappeared.  I was staring right at them and instantly, they were just gone.  I was in disbelief.  I ran back and forth, looking all around trying to see where they could have gone.  I couldn't see them anywhere.  I felt, strange.  I have no idea how to describe it.  After that I just sat on a bench and stared out onto the lake and the sky hoping they'd come back for about 20 minutes but they never did.  I know that what I saw had to be a UFO.;43.0577064927705;-87.9615731499852
Glowing streak high in the sky.;2015-12-14 19:30:00;3 seconds;Glowing streak high in the sky Dec 14, 2015.  7:30 pm. North of Milwaukee, WI.  My son and I were on the back deck enjoying a calm night, semi clear sky, and unseasonably warm temperature.  He said that he thought there was supposed to be meteor activity so we were sitting and looking up.  He burst out, “Whoa!”.  I see a “dash” shaped object glowing brightly and streaking high across the North sky from East to West within our atmosphere.  It wasn’t a meteor, there was no atmospheric piercing flash and fade.  It was a constant light or glow and moved at what appeared a consistent altitude.  It streaked quickly, then appeared to instantaneously stop or slow and then streak again just as fast.  Only lasted 2-3 seconds to cross the sky and gone.  No sound or visible exhaust, no blinking lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
