Bright yellowish/white light hovering, no sound of craft.;2015-09-28 22:08:00;5 minutes;Bright yellowish/white light hovering, no sound of craft. Seen white/yellow bright light in sky hovering.   As I was driving south on Hwy 67.  Hard to see shape, was a bright glare.  Not a plane or helicopter.   As I got closer, light just went out, like someone turned off a switch...   Seen this around same time, a week before..   Pretty sure it wasn't one of those candle lanterns either because it wasn't moving what so ever.;43.0125;-88.4712
