Small rotating object seemed to join large object which decended blow treetops, resembled a formation. a week prior during daylight another object witnessed by 2 people in two different places seen suspended in north sky, very bright, and quiet and floating, not like a plane. The small object with the rotating lights seemed to linger in a general area of the sky and spin around, soon after we saw it, a large object came from the northwest and the small object seemed to disappear, whether it joined the large objectwe don't know for sure. the large object was very brilliant in the shape of a cross with 4 bright lights accross the back and 3 bright lights up the center (a bottom view), we were traveling north and the large object rapidly disappeared below the treetops to our Southeast.  The week before I and my daughter who was going home from work 10 miles away, saw a shiny cigar or flattened oval shape, very brilliant in the north sky in broad daylight.  I watched it and so did she, it didn't seem to be going anywhere and didn't make any noise.  It just sort of drifted in the sky,and appeared quite large.   My daughter was in Baraboo heading northeast and I was standing outside my home just looking at it for at least 3 to 5 minutes.;43.2971;-89.7457
