A flaming UFO was heading towards the ground near my house.;2008-07-24 23:14:00;3 seconds;A flaming UFO was heading towards the ground near my house. I was lying on the living room floor next to my brother-in-law.  He was sleeping.  I was in a position that there was a window straight ahead of me.  I was lying there thinking about what I would do the next day when I saw it.  It appeared oval shaped, but it was difficult to tell for sure because it was engulfed in green flames.  It was going towards the ground at a 45 degree angle at an alarming pace.   It looked like it was going to crash into the corn field across from my house.  I never saw if it crashed or not because it left my line of view.  I got up right away and looked out the window, but I couldn't see any traces of it.   I woke up my brother-in-law in fear.  He told me to go back to sleep and not worry about it.  I was afraid that a charred alien would wander up to the house.  Then not only would I see an alien, but I'd have to watch it die too.  I closed the shades and stayed up for another hour thinking about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
