Repeat Sightings in Delavan, WI.;2013-08-26 21:00:00;20 minutes;Repeat Sightings in Delavan, WI Basically at the time stated, my mother and I were sitting out back and saw an orange orb object similar to the color of orange flame above a farm field in our back yard, this isn't the first time either, we see these objects and sometimes up close, all four of us have, my brother and father included.  Sometimes these objects move closer to the ground across the sky then burn out basically or disappear, sometimes they are red orb objects that turn white and shoot straight up in the air, sometimes they move around with ease north to south in somewhat fixed positions or can move anywhere on a plane, even up and down.   They don't make any noise and they are becoming more and more frequent, in fact if you sat out on my porch a couple of nights I bet you would see something at least once.  The objects usually don't disappear right away either.  Only one case did an object make an appearance then disappear right away.  Most the time we only lose sight of th! em because of the trees in our neighborhood.  I thought first of those floating lamps you can let off or if maybe there was a government base near by but, the closest one is in North Eastern Illinois. Something is going on and I can't quite explain it by conventional means, my dad who doesn't believe in unexplained phenomena thinks that it is government technology that we aren't as the public being told about.  I myself have no idea what it is or why it continues to make itself visual to my perspective on several occasions.  We tried one night flashing a spotlight at it to get a good look and it was a dark object that was inside this orange ball of light because sometimes the orange would come in waves almost as if it were surrounded by neon orange water waves and a dark black metallic object is underneath.;42.6241000000004;-88.6265999999997
