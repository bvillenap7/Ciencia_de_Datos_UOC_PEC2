Fast moving bright object doing high speed &quotaerobatic&quot maneuvers;2019-11-02 23:25:00;5 minutes;Fast moving bright object doing high speed &quotaerobatic&quot maneuvers I was out for a walk by the lake late at night and saw a bright, round object above the tree line (1000-2000’ in the air). It was orange and red, and moved up, down, left and right at an extremely high speed. It did not flicker. Its movements were large, but appeared constrained to one box about a half a mile wide.  This was the second time I have seen this, the first time was in 2011 on the northeast side of the lake, this one was the southeast side.  There were aircraft in the vicinity, but none remarkably close to the object. The time I saw this phenomenon in 2011, it revealed a teal light underneath before “flying” away. Both times the object seemed to shrink into nothing before disappearing. Observation distance was 1-2 miles.  I have an aviation background and am very familiar with different types of aircraft and landing lights. This may (or may not) have been an unmanned aircraft being used/tested by the military, since I’ve seen it twice in roughly the same area within 10 years. Whatever it is, it’s far too big to be a personal UAV. I was too far away to tell if it made a sound or not.;42.6241000000004;-88.6265999999997
