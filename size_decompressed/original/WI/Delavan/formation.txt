Flying perfectly spaced apart, at the same distance from each other, going in the same direction.. and at a very, very high rate of speed.  They were all in a perfect line heading due east and disappeared at the exact same time.  was like a perfectly executed military drill... at night... I've never seen anything like it.;42.6241000000004;-88.6265999999997
