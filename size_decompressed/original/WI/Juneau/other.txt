a series of lights moving like a snake;1974-11-16 17:01:00;20 seconds;a series of lights moving like a snake I was coming in from loading my woodburner and as I came around the house a series of 8 lights caught my eye and it seemed stationary until it turned.  It disappeared very shortly as a national guard blackhawk was coming in for its training manuvers.  Since then we have heard more helicopters in the area which is rare out here.;43.3791999999997;-88.6845000000004
