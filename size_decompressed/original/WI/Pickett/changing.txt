They moved very fast. Then about five minutes later we saw them in the northwest again.  Flashing quickly and moving very quickly.  Then 10 minutes later we saw one bright yellow light and then another underneath it.  And then within a minute, four very bright yellow lights in a horizontal row (this was in the northwest sky).  Amazing.  Any idea what this was?  Can anyone please help explain.;43.9009;-88.7135
