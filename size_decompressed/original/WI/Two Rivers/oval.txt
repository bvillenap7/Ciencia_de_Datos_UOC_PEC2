Unexplained lights over Lake Michigan and lake shore.;2013-10-21 19:45:00;15 minutes;Unexplained lights over Lake Michigan and lake shore. I had just completed fueling my truck at the local mini mart.  The time was approximately 7:45pm and dark.  Weather conditions were overcast cloud ceiling approximately 1500 to 2000 feet.   I was traveling eastward when I observed 3 rather large rose colored or strawberry colored lights in a tight formation with the center light slightly higher.  I thought the color most unusual and altitude very low.  I initially thought perhaps the Coast Guard was having an exercise over lake Michigan.  I than observed a 4th object in the sky, this object appeared to be closer and larger moving very slowly in a southeasterly direction.  I followed down the road until I came to the east river preventing me going any further.  It was large I thought it may have been a helicopter but I've never seen a helicopter lit in such a manner.   The lights were not spotlights I'm sure of that.  The entire object was emitting the color.  I did not observe any navigational lights.  I'm guessing the object had to be 1/8 to  1/4 mile in front of me.  I shut the truck off rolled my window down and was expecting to hear the sound of a helicopter but it was silent.  I remember saying this was messed up! The first three objects appeared to be over Lake Michigan further out.  I restarted my truck drove to my home 4 blocks to the south and stood in my back yard and watched the first 3 objects climb quickly in a upward direction away from me.  I entered my home told the wife what I saw and went directly to my computer and entered flight radar 24 and checked my airspace and there were no aircraft in my towns vicinity.  It is also unusual to have low flying aircraft around Two Rivers W.I. due to the proximity to the 2 Nuke power plants literally only 5 miles north.  I'm 50 and can't logically explain what I saw!   I grew up next to 177th Fighter Group & a Coast Guard Air Station and never saw anything like that.;44.1659999999998;-87.5832000000001
