Fast moving craft in the night sky;2008-08-30 23:22:00;1 Minute;Fast moving craft in the night sky Tonight while smoking a cigarette outside of my apartment facing and looking to the east, I saw a UFO.  It appeared just below the bottom left star of what appears to be the big dipper.  At first it looked like a star, then all of a sudden with in a few seconds of me noticing it, (because I always am looking into the sky because of previous sightings I had but did not report) it moved at a very high rate of speed very close, within 200 yards I would say.   Then as fast as it came it flew away at an even faster speed, and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
