It looked almost like a firework with a glowing ball and a trailing stream that flickered like a flaming tail. Since there was no noise that I could hear, I assumed that this was a large meteor. Shortly after I saw the green fireball moving west to east, I saw 4 more familiar looking meteors, which were very quick streaks of white light which diminished quickly, and they all moving from north to south. The green fireball, moved much slower, in a different direction, and was the same brightness all the while I observed it. I lost sight of it when it was obscured by my neighbor's house. I thought this object was unusual enough to report since I have never seen anything like it. Other than the above, I really couldn't give you any more info. I am A regular Art Bell listener so I was aware of your reporting center.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
Evenly spaced yellow orange fireballs traveling across the sky.;2012-11-21 17:00:00;5 minutes;Evenly spaced yellow orange fireballs traveling across the sky. I was walking to my car in the Festival parking lot and saw another guy staring up at the sky. I looked too, the two of us stood there trying to determine what these reasonably even spaced, traveling rather slowly fireball looking objects were.  I suggested perhaps they were some sort of helicopter but the guy next to me pointed out wouldn't we hear them?  Because they were a distance close enough that you would expect to hear some sort of sound.  They proceeded as if they were following each other. Neither one of us could determine what type of known flying object they could be. Seemed within the possibility of what a human could invent, but seemed odd and not like anything I had ever seen.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413

3 Fireball Objects Flying in Formation in Appleton WI 22:30 on 6/23/15;2015-06-23 22:30:00;4 minutes;3 Fireball Objects Flying in Formation in Appleton WI 22:30 on 6/23/15 As I was driving home at 22:30 on 6/23/15, Northbound on Northland Avenue/OO in Appleton, WI, I looked up, as I was nearing the Ballard intersection, and saw 3 fireball type objects flying in formation.  They appeared to be flying quite low, about the height of a radio tower.  I snapped 2 pictures with my phone right after I spotted them.  They continued to cross over the highway and once they were behind me I did a U-turn so I could continue to watch.  I rolled down my window and turned off my radio to see if I could hear any sound from them but I could not.   Right after I turned my car around, the 2 at the edges blinked out at almost the same time and the middle one faded and blinked out within 15-20 seconds afterward.   I pulled over on a side street near where they blinked out and got out of my car to see if I could see or hear anything, but I could not, and they did not reappear within the 5 minutes I stayed there.   I am a social worker and I had another sighting which I reported on August 8, 2014, in which I saw 6-7 similar unexplained objects with one other witness, and was able to collect a video that time.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
