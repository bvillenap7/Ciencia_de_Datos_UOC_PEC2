Appleton, Wisconsin UFO Silhouette Descending Towards Downtown.;2011-08-19 22:00:00;4 seconds;Appleton, Wisconsin UFO Silhouette Descending Towards Downtown. I was sitting on my porch in the Colony Oaks neighborhood of Appleton, WI, after watching a Packer game on TV and I looked up and saw the silhouette of a UFO descending west towards downtown.  It was very quick and there were no lights on the object I saw.  It was perfectly saucer shaped, almost like two cymbals connected at their undersides. It was parallel to the horizon, and descending diagonally.  The lights of the city lit up the clouds overhead so I was able to see the silhouette.  It flew behind a big tree across the road. It took a moment for me to come out of shock to get up and try and see where it went but it was gone.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
