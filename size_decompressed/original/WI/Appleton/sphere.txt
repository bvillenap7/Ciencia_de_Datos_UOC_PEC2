When I arrived there were 3 other witnesses on the street observing the same lights.   They were a reddish-orange color and seemed to shimmer and shine and move in an eastward direction.   After passing our location they vanished and could not be seen in the east.  The objects were sphere or orb-like and were in a pattern of symmetry.  The event lasted a couple of minutes as they continued to appear and then disappear.  There was no sound present for such an event.  We were in such amazement at what we were viewing that we never thought to grab our camera and capture the moment.    We didn't want to take our eyes off of the lights.  We have never seen anything like this before.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
Three of us saw eight illuminated orbs hovering near us in a moving vehicle for a few minutes.;2013-12-24 19:35:00;4 minutes;Three of us saw eight illuminated orbs hovering near us in a moving vehicle for a few minutes. My husband, daughter, and myself were in a truck heading to the local movie theater when we saw eight small orbs hovering in the sky.  The colors were either yellow/orange or red, and they gave off a glow.  Since it was Christmas Eve I was joking it was Santa. The orbs lingered around the same area until we moved out of sight.  We watched them for a few minutes while they were visible until the distance and city lights blocked them out. The objects moved in all directions, but very slowly.  The overall direction of movement was north to northeast.  They were not in any kind of formation.  They were too small and close to each other, and moving too slowly to be local aircraft as we do have an airport near the sighting area. At first I thought they were Chinese lanterns, but then realized there was a slight breeze so it didn't match the orb movement.  The orbs were fairly close to the ground (few hundred feet or so above us) and stayed at about that level. We did not have cell phones or camera with us at the time it happened so we do not have any video or photo evidence.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
