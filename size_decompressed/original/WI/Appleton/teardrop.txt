I was at a friend's house for New Year's eve party. When the clock read 11:59 I was getting ready for the 10 second countdown when I heard a sound like a computer starting up except it was much louder. I looked up and saw 6 tear droped objects shaped like a triangle the lead one was the biggest it was a red glowing color. The other five were smaller and were a yellow glowing color. They were flying to the south-east.They started circling in the air on top of me. I told my friend and they looked and asked what is that? When my friends started the ten second countdown I looked away. When I looked up the shapes were gone. I work at a plane muesem thirty minutes away from my house. I have never seen anything like those things before. I was wondering if anyone else has ever seen anything like that before.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
