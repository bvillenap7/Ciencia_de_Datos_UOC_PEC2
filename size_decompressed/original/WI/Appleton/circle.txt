A circular object from the sky fell to the ground with a loud wooshing sound.;2010-06-26 03:15:00;5 min;A circular object from the sky fell to the ground with a loud wooshing sound. My cousin and I were sitting in the car driving in the outskirts of town.  We were on our way to highcliff. Our tire blew so we had to pull over to change it.  When the car was jacked up we heard a loud wooshing sound.  We were conviced it was the wind of the storm, but it continued to accelerate in volume.  So, we looked around and in the field to the right of us there was a blinding light similar to lightning, but it was lingering too long to actually be lighting.  We looked up to see a circular shape moving across the sky in a painstakingly slow straight line.  Then, we saw a half of a circle fall to the ground.   We immediately grabbed the flashlight to find this object and nothing was there.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413

The light on the left disappeared while the other light remained, but then there were multiple lights In a line (4 or 5 lights directing downward from where the light disappeared).   All the lights then went out. This all happened within less than a minute.  However,  I checked 15- 20 minutes later and 2 planes flew overhead, higher than the first two (one from the northeast and one from the southeast coming in the same direction and proceeded west with one another), my guess is that those lights were actual airplanes.

A dozen or so noisless orb like flaming balls of light that moved west across the sky and disapeared.;2012-03-09 22:12:00;5 minutes;a dozen or so noisless orb like flaming balls of light that moved west across the sky and disapeared. I showed up at a friends house at around 10:12 pm.  When i went up to his door i glanced around and happened to see a bunch of strange lights through the trees that divided his property from the neighbors property.  My friend was on the phone when he answered the door, and when i saw the lights i became curious and decided to walk back towards the edge of the property where i could better see them.  As i stood watching them i noticed that the lights were moving.  There was a group of about 8 to 10 lights congregated and 2 lights that seemed to be following the larger group from a distance.  The larger group of lights seemed to be spaced apart from one another in a way that formed a kind of half moon shape.  Each light that was in the half moon shape seemed to be at almost a perfect distance from each other.  There were also a few lights around the half moon shape that were not part of this alignment.  As i realized that what i was seeing was something i couldn't exp! lain i decided to call my friend over and point out what i was seeing.  Once my friend saw the lights we continued to watch and follow them on foot as they moved west.  They didn't make any abrupt movements, however some of them moved up and down in the sky and some seemed to hover in one spot while others moved more quickly.  After a short period of time some of the lights began to dim. It was like one of those touch lamps with different settings of brightness on it.  Some of the lights seemed to dim quicker than others, but before disappearing completely they looked white like a star.  There also seemed to be a red blinking light that became more visible as the light dimmed.  The lights at their brightest looked similar to an orb or candle flame if you could control the shape of flame to a circular shape.  My friend was able to capture a short video of the two lights that seemed to be following the larger congregation of lights.  Whatever these objects were they did not give off ! any sound.  Also, at one point one of the lights moved towards one of t he other lights. When the light got close to the other light it dimmed out and disappeared.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
Nine orange fireballs;2013-05-29 01:00:00;5 minutes;Nine orange fireballs While walking the dog after work, I looked up for some reason and noticed a line of nine orange fireball looking objects.  It was cloudy, and they were clearly below the cloud cover.  They did not move very fast, but eventually faded from sight as they rose above the cloud cover.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
Reddish orange blurred flying object on 4th of July 2019.;2019-07-04 21:00:00;1 minute;Reddish orange blurred flying object on 4th of July 2019. My friend and I were outside and she saw the first one before I could grab my phone to get this second one. Her phone was too blurry, so I shot this one.  It was a reddish orange color and didn't move like the medical helicopter or planes that sometimes fly over.  We often like looking up at the sky, I am a storm spotter, and my friend identifies stars for NASA that haven't been discovered yet.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
