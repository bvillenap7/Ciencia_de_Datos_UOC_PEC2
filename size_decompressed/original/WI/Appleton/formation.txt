3 fiery orbs mimicking a large plane;2000-02-16 09:35:00;6 minutes;3 fiery orbs mimicking a large plane 3 fiery yellow orbs surrounded by small blinking lights roughly 100 feet off the ground and 150 yards away moving in a formation that mimics a plane.  There was no noise and no plane body seen, and the 3 brightest orbs never blinked. It made a full circle around my house and appeared to me that to anybody else in a different position closer to ground could mistake it for an aircraft. We watched as it  slowly in a circular flight pattern until it dipped down in the presence of a tree line. A street light had started to react as it was dipping down into the tree line A couple nights earlier we had seen 3 blinking or pulsing objects appeared in the sky all area of the sky flying all flying in different directions, they would appear mundane to the average person who does not watch for strange objects, but the fact that 3 objects appeared in the same part of the sky eerily close to each other would suggest something is out of kilter.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
Color changing orb expands into three yellow orbs at low altitude, high rate of speed, no sound.;2013-05-10 22:00:00;15 minutes;Color changing orb expands into three yellow orbs at low altitude, high rate of speed, no sound I was on the second floor balcony of a hotel that overlooked a bar.  I was a teenage boy at the time. I was watching adults hanging around outside the bar and chatting with a friend. A light was moving from left to right slowly across the horizon. It never looked like it was very high in the sky. It looked to be very far away. The object was changing colors. Red, white, blue, red, white, blue, in smooth transition, color changed ever five seconds or so. No blinking or flashing. It appeared to be one light. As the object got in a 1:00 position it started getting closer and closer at a very high rate of speed. Faster than any aircraft I've ever seen. When it got to be about half way between me and it's original position the light got bigger. When it was about 300 yards in front of me the single orb split creating three yellow/gold glowing ovals that were layed horizontaly and stacked in a triangular formation.  O O     O   The object flew over the bar in front of us and then over our heads what looked to be no more than 60 yards above our heads.  The orbs didn't seem to emit light like the headlight from a car.  The light seemed  &quotcontained&quot. It made absolutely no sound. I could not see a center to the object.  It looked to be one object the way the lights moved in formation but I can't be certain.  It looked like the lights took up about the same space as a full size van...maybe a bit bigger.  My friend and I looked at each other and our mouths dropped because we both had no idea what we just saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  PD));44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
