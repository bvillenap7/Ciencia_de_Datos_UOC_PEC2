small blue and white bright circular figure;2008-10-28 22:00:00;About 5 Seconds;As I was riding my bike I noticed this small blue and white bright circular figure at about 10 pm in Appleton, Wisconsin. At sometimes it seemed to be just a bright dot in the sky I know that what I saw wasnâ€™t an airplane or an aircraft. I looked up to the sky, and I saw the light after about 5 seconds it went at a speed that no other aircraft can achieve. Then it disappeared in plain sight as if it had gone into some sort of teleport.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
I was walking with my friend as we were taking the dog out.

As I go to catch up with him, he spots this bright bulb of light that seemed to be hovering several thousands of feet above the apartment buildings in which I live at and spinning in a counter-clockwise pattern.  Also, the lighting pattern was very sperratic.  Anyways, the anomaly was hovering for about two minutes and then it started moving eastbound, first very slowly and then picking up speed, and then it disappeared into the horizon. I don't know what it was, but both my friend and I rule out the fact that it was a plane.  Also as we go back into my friends house, we realize that his mom received a bizarre phone call the number was labeled unavailable.  If an investigator wishes to contact me, please do so via email.  Thanks.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
Satellite-looking object coming to a complete stop.;2013-06-01 02:30:00;10 minutes;satellite looking object coming to a complete stop. I contacted you earlier in the night to basically report a satellite that I witnessed so later in the night I stepped back out side to see if I could catch another look and about 20 min later I noticed a satellite looking object coming from the east towards the west and I just figured it was another satellite until I noticed another satellite looking object coming from the south to the north looking as if they were going to collide but right before they got to the same spot they came to a complete stop, that was when I called my wife outside and we continued to watch the same spot and it seemed that the lights dissipated and 5 min later we saw a flash of baby blue light just to the east of the position of where the lights were and 5 min after that a light came from the same position but it was not white it was multi color and shimmering and it traveled to the north and with the way it was shimmering we could track it until it went to the horizon then it all ! stopped and I sat outside for the rest of the night and saw nothing else except a couple of shooting stars and no more satellites.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
Flash above.;2013-06-30 22:00:00;1 minute;flash above Me and my family were outside lighting off fireworks and my wife noticed a light going across the sky andwe looked up to see this star moving from a southern direction to the north and when it got directly overhead wr saw a flash of light come down but did not illuminate the the surrounding area, then a 30 seconds later a second star shape was on the same trajectory as the first but a little dimmer and then it faded out of site as the first,   then a third one came from the north towards the south just a bit off to the west of the other two objects a minute later, not saying anything is strange except for the fact that out of 5 years of living here and looking up with the kids and their telescope never have seen this and being from Texas as a kid I could recognize a satellite pretty quick but never seen a flash or so many at one time, like to know what was going on in my neighborhood at the time.

At first looked like set of car headlights soaring in the sky,  Thought it was a plane at first. Got closer and the lights faded out..;2014-01-20 17:10:00;5 minutes;At first looked like set of car headlights soaring in the sky,  Thought it was a plane at first. Got closer and the lights faded out.. 	I was traveling southwest, and what I saw was traveling south.  At first, I thought it was another plane.  Two bright lights, slowly traveling across the sky, but no flashing light.  They seemed to be more like headlights of a car.  I kept my eyes on the lights as it soared closer to the road I was driving on.  Right when we would have crossed paths, the lights faded out quickly and was no where in sight. 	If it was a plane that shut the lights off, I would have seen the silhouette of it.  There was just a enough sunlight in the sky to allow me to see if there was indeed an object (like a plane) containing these lights.  The problem is, the lights simply disappeared and there was no object behind the lights. . .;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
Ball of light in the sky was falling to the ground.;2016-01-22 20:00:00;10 seconds;Ball of light in the sky was falling to the ground. I was riding my bike and while I was doing that I was looking up at the sky.  It was nice and clear, for the most part.   I was clearly looking at the Big Dipper, then when I went to put my head down to look at the road, I realized a star was falling, but when I started to turn like when a airplane is about to crash...you know know doing circles because it can't go straight.  It was going down to my right side the it made a sharp left turn then just dropped all the way down to the point I couldn't see it because of the houses.

Bright object seen over the city of Appleton WI.;2016-08-11 20:50:00;3 minutes;Bright object seen over the city of Appleton WI. One object.  Super bright light.  No sound.  Directly over the city of Appleton.   Was still in the sky for about a minute before tracking slowly to the northeast.   After about one minute it accelerated at a much higher rate of speed and turned red in color as it disappeared.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
In the distance over Appleton, 2 bright white lights spaced probably 10 meters apart.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-30 22:30:00;2 minutes;I was driving to work and seen in the sky, in the distance over Appleton 2 bright white lights spaced probably 10 meters apart.  They hovered motionless for about 2 minutes and I watched as they disappeared.  Try would have been bright enough to see behind the clouds so I think they faded instead of moving away.
