Metallic triangular shaped object appearing to tumble in the sky.;2021-04-22 20:50:00;20+ minutes;Metallic triangular shaped object appearing to tumble in the sky. April 22nd, 8:50pm central time  I was taking the garbage cans to the street and I had an intense feeling that I should look up. In the southwest sky there was a triangular shaped metallic object that appeared to have a tumbling motion even tho I didn’t really see it move positions in the sky. I ran inside to grab my phone and unfortunately it doesn’t show up very well but you can still see the shape and tumbling motion. There was no sound associated w the object but it was very far away  About 9:10 it was still there and I went back into the house. I am a retired seargent detective for the Grainger County Tennessee Sheriffs Department. I also worked as a paramedic and firefighter for that county.;44.2677275557633;-88.3921484665413
