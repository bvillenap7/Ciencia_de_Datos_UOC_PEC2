Possible UFO over east central Wisconsin;2011-02-14 19:20:00;30 seconds;Possible UFO over east central Wisconsin We were outdoors in the driveway of our rural home, just having come home from work.  We heard what sounded like a military jet roaring over. When we looked up, we saw 2 lights moving through the sky above heading southwest.  One of them seemed to be chasing the other. They were both moving fast but the chase light was definitely moving faster.  Then the slower of them very abruptly zigged, then zagged.  At this point, it zoomed off into the night sky.  The faster object continued on its path and disappeared in teh night sky as well.  All this took place in less than 30 seconds, possibly quite a bit less.  Is it possible that a military jet was dispatched to check into an unknown object in the sky?  Winneconne is located about 12 miles nearly straight north of Oshkosh Wisconsin.;44.119;-88.7178
