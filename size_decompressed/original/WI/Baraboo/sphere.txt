Stationary silver sphere over town.;1998-04-15 08:20:00;30 sec;Stationary silver sphere over town. Saw a silver sphere over town in a clear and cloudless sky while driving, pulled over and stopped to make sure it was not a reflection. It appeared stationary and about the size of a full moon but was featureless, then it started disappearing, the missing sections shaped like orange slices, starting on the left side, each disappearance instantaneous and about 2 seconds apart, until the object was 'gone'. I was an Air Force brat and am also former active duty Air Force so all conventional craft and floating objects are familiar. I have been waiting to see another report of an object that 'disappears' in the fashion described above, but have run out of patience. Sometime over the years I misplaced the written details of the date and time, but I know it was in the first two business hours of the day in Spring, March-April-May of '98. Will also send a jpeg image created with MS Paint that depicts the disappearance. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
