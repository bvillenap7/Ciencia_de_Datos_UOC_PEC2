Planets confirmed with Google sky on android phone immediately after sighting visible for 4 seconds as it crossed in apparent straight line across 2/3 of sky. east horizon was obstructed by house west horizon was obstructed by house  Observation walking out to the car, husband made mention of Jupiter/Venus conjunction in the western sky.  Then pointed out mars in the eastern sky. Wife observed UFO first, just beneath Mars. Then all 3 observed the diamond shaped formation track silently across the visible sky east to west in about 4 seconds. Formation did not change shape. No sound nor contrail was observed.  Unable to determine whether the 4 lights were separate moving in unison or all connected to the same craft. Sky behind light formation contained no distinguishable stars, so the formation did not appear to move in front of a star to block it out.  The 4 dim orange lights did not blink. They resembled in color a tiny dark ember from a bon-fire, but much dimmer. They were so dim as to not draw drawn attention to itself if we hadn't been looking right at it as it moved. The size of the aerial craft appeared rather large about the size of length of husbandâ€™s thumb (tip to first joint) at arm's length.  Full moon was still below the eastern horizon. Full moon became visible a couple hours later.  Husband: 10 years USAF vetran. Observed MANY, various traditional military aircraft, and more recent drone craft.  Nothing resembling the size, speed and silence of this sighting. First real UFO sighting - been looking for decades, but have never seen one until tonight. Wow! It is paradigm changing!
