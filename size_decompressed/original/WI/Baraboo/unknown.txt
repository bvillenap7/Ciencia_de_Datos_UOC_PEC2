One craft, every color, low, horizon to horizon in one second.;2011-03-11 00:08:00;1.5 seconds;One craft, every color, low, horizon to horizon in one second. On the evening of March 10, early morning March 11, 2011, at approx. 12:08am, I was standing in my front lawn facing north by north east looking at the sky.  The night was very clear and you could see millions upon millions of stars.   All of a sudden, in about one second, a very large, very low object flew from my back right shoulder to my front left shoulder.  I would estimate about 180 degrees across the sky, much lower than ANY aircraft EVER.   And here's the weird thing. NO NOISE!! AND BRIGHT!!  But not bright like headlights coming at you.  It didn't cast any light.  It didn't light up the sky. And it was every color I have ever seen.  Like a rainbow all at once.  It glowed.   So, here's this thing, very fast, very low, very bright but no radiance.  From the southeast sky to the northwest sky immediately.  Like a speedboat across the sky pulling a rainbow.  Instantaneous.  I have never experienced anything like this.   Sorry if my report is short, so was what I saw.  But, it changed my life.   Fun Fact:  When I woke up the next morning, the Japan Tsunami was all over the news.  I've heard of things like this being connected before.;43.4831000000005;-89.7509999999985
