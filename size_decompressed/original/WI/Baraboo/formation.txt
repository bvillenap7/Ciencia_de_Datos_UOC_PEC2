A large group of friends were camping at the camp ground formerly know as Nordic Pines when we saw 4 lights appeared on the western horizon going east in a straight line formation holding that pattern perfectly as if connected. It seemed to be very high up. According to the Flight Trader 24 app there were no airplanes flying across this area at the time of the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.
