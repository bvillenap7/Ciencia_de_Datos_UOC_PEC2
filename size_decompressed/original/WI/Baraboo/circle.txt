Several sightings in one night in same area...;2011-09-10 21:00:00;21 min;Several sightings in one night in same area... On 9-10-11 around 9pm I was fishing on Devils Lake in Baraboo WI, I was facing north when I look up and noticed a solid orange light moving in the sky, it was moving very slow and after about 8 minutes of watching it a passenger jet was flying north and I was comparing the two and then all of the sudden the orange light disappeared but it did not resemble an airplane of any kind.. After the jet got out of sight I kept watching the same area in the sky and then all the sudden it was like it came from the ground behind a hill the same orange object rising in the sky.  After seeing it again for about 2 minutes this time till another passenger jet flew over the area it disappeared again.. After a few seconds of that jet getting out of sight I kept watching the same area and sure enough it came up over the same hill again but then a couple seconds more another one came over the same hill in the same path as the first, now there was 2 of them they were just sitting still then started to go higher and then another jet had to fly over the area and they both disappeared at the same time.. I watched the 2 for about 5 minutes... I took a couple photos with my phone but all u can see is the lights against the black so its hard to say what they are in the photo.... I kept on fishing and watching the that area but nothing came back...  Till about 2 hrs later I was on the other side of the lake facing south when all of the sudden another orange light appeared from the south moving north right towards me and much closer and as it got closer the outside edge around the object got red and the inside of it looked like a fireball, it got almost right above me when it made a turn to the west and just disappeared like the other ones...  I watched this one for about 6 minutes and I got a photo of this one to but the same results...  This was the 3 time this summer I had seen these lights the first time was 3 months prier to this and was fishing the same lake, the second time was at my house about a mile from Devils Lake...  My brother also seen a fireball like object 2 months ago along the interstate by Deforest WI...  This seems to be a very active year for these sightings around here...;43.4831000000005;-89.7509999999985
