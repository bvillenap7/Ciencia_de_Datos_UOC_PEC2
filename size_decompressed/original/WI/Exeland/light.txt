Satellite stopped in the sky;2011-12-18 20:00:00;5 minutes;satellite stopped in the sky Sunday, December 18th, 2011. I was at my father’s house in Exeland, WI.  I stepped out on his southern porch to smoke a cigarette sometime between 7:00pm and 9:00pm. I was looking up at the stars, as usual, scanning for satellites and/or shooting stars.  I have watched many satellites from his porch, including watching the space station go over a few years back. I spotted what I assumed to be a satellite (just a small steady white light) moving in a straight line, at a consistent speed, from east to west overhead.  I followed it’s trajectory with my eyes across the sky, glad that I had spotted one and planning to watch it until it disappeared behind the trees to the west. It went normally until it had crossed about 75% of the sky within my vision, and then it stopped.  The light did not change in any way.  It did not sparkle or flash…it just stopped. I continued to stare at it until I finished my cigarette, and it did not move again.;45.6747;-91.2188
