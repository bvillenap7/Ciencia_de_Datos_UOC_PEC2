Strange strobe like light;2010-07-15 01:00:00;30min;Strange strobe like light I was on vacation at our summer home located about 15 miles north of 3 Lakes.  We were out star gazing on a very clear night, when we noticed a strange light out of the corner of our eye.  It flashed exactly every 1.5 seconds and encompassed the whole of the northeastern sky.  Reports claim no northern lights or solar flares occurred until two weeks after the incident.  There are also no radio towers in the area, only national forest.  The light was faint, but continued for more than 30 minutes.  There is an airport about 10 miles south, and the tower light is sometimes visible, but that light swept every 3 seconds.  I have been vacationing here for over 20yrs and have never seen anything like this.  I would like to know if this is a natural phenomena, human caused, or other.
