Two big, bright, silent, non-blinking orange fireball-type lights cross Mississippi River valley near De Soto, WI.;2014-08-02 21:00:00;3 minutes;Two big, bright, silent, non-blinking orange fireball-type lights cross Mississippi River valley near De Soto, WI. Approximately 9:00 pm on Saturday, August 2, 2014, two large, bright, non-blinking, silent orange fireball-type lights flew over the Mississippi River valley from the Iowa side to near the town of De Soto, Wisconsin. The first light flew quickly and as it came to the Wisconsin side of the river turned northeast and rapidly faded from view. The second light came right on its heels. This light moved much slower and followed the exact same flight path as the first. We brainstormed the possibilities of what the lights could have been and both agreed that we had never seen anything like them before.
