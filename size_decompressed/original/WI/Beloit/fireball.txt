A yellow fireball diving straight down stops for a few seconds, changes color, then goes straight down again.;2001-03-28 00:30:00;1 minute;A yellow fireball diving straight down stops for a few seconds, changes color, then goes straight down again. My friend and I were driving westbound on Interstate 43 into Beloit, WI when we both saw what, at first, we thought was a plane on fire, heading straight for the ground.  It was going straight down at an accelerating speed, a few hundred feet in the air, when all of the sudden it slowed down and leveled out-like on a plateau, and headed north for a few seconds before resuming it's path downward at the same speed.  It also changed color from an orangish yellow to a bright red.  The end of it looked like it had a flame-like tail.  We lost it behind some trees on the horizon.  We tried to follow it, but didn't see another trace of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD));42.5649000000002;-89.0843000000003
Two big, round balls of fire hovering over beloit, Wi near the South Beloit border;2009-11-05 18:33:00;10 minutes;Two big, round balls of fire hovering over beloit, Wi near the South Beloit border My daughter, son, and I were sitting in the car in front of our house when she started saying mom there's 2 meteors coming towards us.  I jumped out of the car to see them and starred in amazment, realizing they weren't meteors but were bright red or orange balls of fire that seemed to be following each other like they were playing.  Each ball kept moving ahead of the other until they stopped right in front of us and just hoovered there for about 5 more minutes.   We saw an airplane coming towards them and all of a sudden one of the firballs started to get lighter, then darker again, and lighter until it was no longer visible and then the other one did the same until both were gone completely!  I waited to see if they'd come back into sight but didn't and my neighbor also was outside and seen them as well.  I do beleive what we all saw was 2 ufo's and have never been so scared in my life!
