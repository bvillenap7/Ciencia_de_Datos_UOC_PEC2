2 Triangle UFOs Spotted over Wisconsin;1993-08-09 02:45:00;8-10 Minutes;2 Triangle UFOs Spotted over Wisconsin Not real sure on the Exact Date, it was Late 93 0r Early 94. Sighting was East of Beloit, Wi. about 45 Miles On I-43 2:45 a.m. Craft was spotted coming over a tree line south of I-43 Moving North, Very Slow. I pulled over on the Shoulder, and called out to a couple of truck drivers behind me on the C.B. to see if they could see what I'm Seeing? First Driver advised he could, and then the other 2 could too. they also pulled over and we all watched in in a mild case of shock. The Craft moved across the Hwy, and the 2nd Craft started to clear the Tree Line just a little east of the first one. Both Craft where Huge, Triangler in Shape, with thick rounded Edges, almost Gun Metal Blue in Color, But No Lights of any kind. It was a very Clear Night, Middle of No-Where (No City Lights) And the Crafts Blocked the Stars as they moved to the North. Alt. was about 500-600 Ft. Speed Dead Slow, and Not a Sound...  No Humm or Nothing. Not one of us had a Camera.  All we could do is watch as they moved Right Over Us to the North Tree Line and out of sight.  After they had gone. we talked for a few minutes about what we should do, Make a report or What...  Come down to NOBODY would believe it.  And we left it at that... BUT! The Next Day, On the Paul Harvey Radio Show, He Talked about some Air Port & Air Base Spotting 2 Unknown Objects that Very Night, as Possible UFOs. Funny Thing is, You Never heard anything else about it. Nothing! I wish the Other Drivers that where there that night with me would come forward...  I Heard of your UFO Center on Coast to Coast A.M.  It's Been 12 year from the Time of the Sighting, and to be able to tell it at last, is like a breath of fresh air!!!! If you can Track Down that Paul Harvey Report, it will Nail down the Exact Date of the Sightings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Triangular shape obscures starlight as it moves across the night sky;1994-08-01 22:30:00;45 seconds;Triangular shape obscures starlight as it moves across the night sky I recently watched a program about UFO sightings and one of the UFO configurations reminded me of an object I had seen in the night sky fifteen years ago.  One does not report such things unless he is willing to be scrutinized.  I was not so willing.  I am grateful that I can share this anonymously and be taken seriously. It was mid summer in Beloit, Wisconsin.  Some friends and I were sitting around a bon fire that night talking and laughing.  I enjoy looking up at the stars, wondering what else is out there and who.  As I was gazing into the night sky something, a shape, caught my attention.  There were no lights or sound.  There was only that large triangular shape obscuring the starlight as it glided stealthily across the sky.  If you were to hold your hand up, it would have been approximately half the size.  I watched it move silently for about 45 seconds.  It didn’t move fast, but it maintained a constant speed. My mind raced for a logical explanation, but I could find none.  I thought perhaps it was a stealth fighter plane.  I then deduced that it would have moved faster and made some sort of sound as it passed by.  Not to mention, it would have had lights being over U.S. soil.  I also thought about telling my friends, but I didn’t feel comfortable with being called crazy or told I was just seeing things.  That was the only time I saw an object as such, yet I still stare up at the sky hoping that I might catch a glimpse of it one more time. I know it’s not much, but it is what I saw that night.  This is the first I’ve even mentioned it.  Please, do not take this as a hoax.  I know what I saw and I know we are not alone. Sincerely,  Sky watcher in WI ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.5649000000002;-89.0843000000003
3 bright white triangular lights moving far faster than any known jet with no noise!;2002-07-30 21:45:00;30 seconds;3 bright white triangular lights moving far faster than any known jet with no noise! 3 very white bright lights,coming out of the north directly at us. My daughter said,Dad's what that? 20 seconds later,the 3 triangular lights were moving directly west (and were the same look from behind!). 10 seconds later, a jumbo jet heading for chicago passed over at a lot lower altitude that was smaller and a lot less brighter than what passed right over it! I know that passing jet had to have seen it. I called the county airport to see what it was at 22:10.Tell me I'm not crazy, I've never seen this kind of air traffic before. ((NUFORC Note:  Apparently, time and date are approximate.  We do not know what a time of 21:75 is.  PD));42.5649000000002;-89.0843000000003

Trianglular shaped object with colored lights on each side seen in rural Beloit.;2018-03-16 20:30:00;10 minutes;Trianglular shaped object with colored lights on each side seen in rural Beloit. I saw a triangle shaped craft that landed about 100 feet from my home.  It remained there for about a minute and then lifted straight up to about 20 feet from the ground.  The object was triangle shaped and about 3 feet long on each side.  It had pinkish red lights on one side, blue/green lights on another, and white lights on the last side.  It was rotating so I could see each color.  It moved toward my home and while doing so it moved erratically up and down.  It looked like it was diving down then lifting up.  There was no sound from this object.  I live in rural Beloit, in a wooded area and I can't imagine a drone flying over this area. It moved over the woods and then out of my sight.;42.5649000000002;-89.0843000000003
Perfectly still, silent, brightly lighted object suspended in sky;2020-07-13 22:30:00;3 minutes;Perfectly still, silent, brightly lighted object suspended in sky We were driving in a neighborhood and both of us see a very large object above the tall tree line. There were two very large, really bright, white rectangular lights facing forward illuminating the sky.  One smaller red light was at the back of the object.  The thing was absolutely silent and suspended (no movement whatsoever.  Seemed more like “parked” than hovering).  After a couple minutes, it very quickly moved away in a linear fashion and was just gone.  We were also surprised to see that the time was 15-30 minutes later than we thought it should be (though we cannot verify this for sure).;42.5649000000002;-89.0843000000003
Bright V-shaped flashing object moved faster than a plane in night sky;2021-01-25 00:20:00;1 min;Bright V-shaped flashing object moved faster than a plane in night sky A bright V-shaped object moved across the sky. We noticed it was twice the speed of an airplane. As it came into view, we noticed it had white lights on the sides with a red light circulating around the sides. The object moved fast for 30 seconds, then slowed down before moving out of view. It traveled in a straight line the whole way.;42.5649000000002;-89.0843000000003
