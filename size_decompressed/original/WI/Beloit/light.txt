Saw white light accelerate in an arc high in the sky in Beloit, WI.;2006-10-01 20:00:00;-1 minute;Saw white light accelerate in an arc high in the sky in Beloit, WI In the fall of 2006, I was attending college in Beloit, Wisconsin.  The campus sits beside the Rock River, and is unusual in that there are several Indian mounds on the campus greens, including a large effigy mound in the shape of a turtle.   I was living in a dormitory, in a room on the north side of the building, with a single window facing north.  There was a large tree next to that window, so this would have to have been fairly far into the fall, for the tree to be reasonably free of leaves, but I don't remember it being very cold, so maybe very late September or October, and also dark, but I don't remember exactly what time it was.   My bedhead faced this window, and I was lying on the bed on my stomach, again on the computer or doing some work.  I don't think anything special prompted me to look out the window, and again the object I saw was a point of white light about the size of a star, appearing to be high in the sky.  The movement I saw it make was an arc, I'm not positive in which direction, but from the lower part of the visible sky out my window towards the upper part, accelerating considerably as it did, and then leaving my view.   I went outside onto the sidewalk on the south side of the building, and remember it was cold, but not very cold, but couldn't see anything more unusual.   I met another girl outside and asked if she'd seen anything, but she hadn't. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
