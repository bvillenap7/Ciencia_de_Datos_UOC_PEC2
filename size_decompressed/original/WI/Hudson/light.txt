My wife and I saw a light very high in the sky that was not a plane.  ((NUFORC Note:  Daylight sighting of ISS??  PD));2008-08-04 19:00:00;2-3 minutes;My wife and I saw a light very high in the sky that was not a plane. On August 4th 2008 at 7pm, my wife and I observed at very high altitude what appeared to me a blinking light that appeared to go around in a circle.  It was clear, the sun was still out.  I have very good vision and was unable to distiguish it as any type of airplane.   At that same time there where a few planes I could see, also at high altitude and clearly could make them out as airplanes.   It moved from East to West across the sky at about the same rate I would see a satilight at night.  Is it possible that I could have seen a satilight during the day?  But that would not explain the light that appeared to rotate. I could make nothing out but the light. It was very very high in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS was visible over Hudson at 21:37 hrs. in the southwest sky.  Hence, it quite well might have been seen by someone with good eyesight some 94 minutes earlier, we believe.  However, the albedo from the ISS is not seen to blink.  PD));44.9863;-92.7277999999999
Bright red light flying slowly over road;2014-03-29 22:30:00;1 minute;Bright red light flying slowly over road My wife and I were driving home from friends house traveling east on Stage Coach Rd by highway 12 intersection.  Saw a bright red light that seemed to be flying over the road just in front of us traveling in the same direction, east.   My first reaction was flare on parachute, however after watching it, it became obvious that it was a very bright light.  It flew out ahead of us picking up speed than it disappeared behind some trees.  The light was not a nav light or anything related to aviation that I have ever seen.;44.9863;-92.7277999999999
3-5 lights or more moving in the sky in a perfect line one behind the other.;2019-05-26 22:50:00;30 seconds;3-5 lights or more moving in the sky in a perfect line one behind the other. I heard and airplane flying overhead, when I looked up I saw 3-5 lights moving in a SW to NE direction.  The lights I saw were not airplane lights, they looked more like satellites, but all moving at the exact same speed, equally spaced, in a perfect straight line one behind the other.  There were clouds obscuring part of the sky and for a moment I thought I glimpsed a much longer line of lights, perhaps 10+, but I did observer a minimum of 3 very clearly moving one behind the other, as they reached the horizon they faded from view.;44.9863;-92.7277999999999
