It was dark as we left our place of dinner that evening.  Walking up the street, I glanced up to the sky and saw about 20 very bright round lights, which appeared to be floating across the sky all in unison, but yet in distinct small groupings.   They were a simple bright light, with no change in colors whatsoever for any of them.   As quickly as they appeared they floated out of sight as as they moved from Southwest to Northeast. Two individuals walked by us as we were watching the lights and they witnessed what we did.  I have never seen anything like it in my life.;44.9863;-92.7277999999999
