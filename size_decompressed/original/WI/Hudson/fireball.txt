They seemed to be hovering for awhile but then fell behind a treeline pretty far away.  Then we saw three more but one looked bigger and they also looked as if they were hovering so we got my friends mom out my dad and his dad and they all didn't know what they were seeing.   After a while the three fireballs started to fall behind the treeline and disappeared. After about 10 minutes after my friend and I noticed a lot of planes going twards the direction of the fireballs.;44.9863;-92.7277999999999

Just left my house to grab a pack of cigs, approach a 4 way stop when I see what I thought was a small jet on fire about 100 feet above.  When I stopped at the stop sign to get a look, pointing out of my sunroof to the car behind to get their attention.  Vivid orange and red flames surrounding an odd shape flying silently above heading north.  It was flying in an s kind of pattern then takes off and dissapeared into the distance.;44.9863;-92.7277999999999
