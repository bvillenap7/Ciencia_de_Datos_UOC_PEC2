I ran outside and was shocked at the object hovering over the trees next to my property just above the tree tops.  Huge pulsing yellow and white lights.   I grabbed my camera to try and get a picture but it wouldn't work..  Grabbed my phone and it wouldn't work..  My wife's phone also wouldn't work.   After 10-15 minutes it started to float away to the south and proceeded west towards the river.  For about 3 min., it looked like an airplane, when it suddenly went from a horizontal position to vertical.  Was watching in my binoculars when this happened.   That's when I noticed the rectangular shape.  Then it was getting too far out to monitor.  I also noticed 3 pulsing objects the same as I we saw days prior with pulsing reddish orange lites.  Main object appeared to be approx. 20-30+/- yards wide.;44.9863;-92.7277999999999
