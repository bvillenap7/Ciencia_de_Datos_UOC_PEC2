I sat right up to see what was going on and a grey scurried thru my doorway.  I yelled get out but no sounds came out and I couldn't move. I yelled again but no sound,get out, I'll kill you, get out.   The grey ran around to my wife's side of the bed and I yelled don't touch her, leave her alone,leave her alone. I still couldn't move.  All I could hear was don't worry, everything will be ok over and over.  I don't know how much time passed but it seemed like a while.   Suddenly it turned and ran out the bedroom door,the bright lites in my window faded, heard a rumble and then I was able to then move again. I ran out the door after it to the front entry but it was gone.   3 weeks later my daughter was born with a scar on her right side.  It took years for me to tell her what happened.   I'll never forget it as long as I live.;44.9863;-92.7277999999999
The light made absolutely no noise whatsoever it was so quiet it was scary.;1997-02-15 22:30:00;5 minutes;The light made absolutely no noise whatsoever it was so quiet it was scary. At Exit 4 Truck Stop, in Hudson, Wisconsin, off I94, at about 10:30 PM at night, I was in a friend's truck outside in the parking lot of the truck stop, when a glowing light started to fill the sky above us, it was like a beacon coming closer and closer until it filled the whole space above the truck stop, it was so big, you could not see where the object ended. It was approximately 500 feet above the truck stop. It was a bright white light that had a haze to it. On channel 19, the truckers were speaking many profanities because they couldn't understand what it was. The object laid above us for approximately 5 minutes although it felt like a half hour, I don't remember looking at my clock to see how long it was actually there for. Channel 19 went wild with hysteria and confusion. The light made absolutely no noise whatsoever it was so quiet it was scary. I don't remember hearing the engine of the truck roaring. At the same moment the light disappeared, the lights in the truck stop went out as did the electronic equipment and all Semis and vehicles in the parking lot. This happened in a blink of an eye, approximately five seconds and it was gone. We all were dumbfounded. After the incident, we all looked up to the sky and noticed many helicopters around the area. Not many people talked about it though afterwards, which I thought was weird. I've always wanted to report this incident but didn't know who to talk to. ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Second report submitted earlier by same witness follows.  PD)) Exit 4, truck stop in Hudson, Wisconsin UFO spotted. At Exit 4 Truck Stop, I was working as a waitress, and was out in a friend's truck, and a luminous bright light filled the sky, covered the entire truck stop and illuminated the whole area of the truck stop so we don't know what shape it was. It had absolutely no sound whatsoever. I heard truckers on channel 19 on the CB saying things like What the *** is that?, Sh**, I know I haven't drank tonight, please someone tell me what the *** that thing is, that is no *** airplane, etc...channel 19 was running like a mad house with profanity. the lights went out at the truck stop at the same time it disappeared, and the trucks, all the trucks lost power too, all electronic equipment was shut off for approximately 5-10 seconds while the craft disappeared...the craft just shut off it's light the way it looked, but it was gone. After the lights came back on, we saw many helicopters in the skies surrounding the area which normally was not that heavy with aircraft traffic at that time of night.;44.9863;-92.7277999999999
Multi-colored object spotted hovering, speeding up and stopping quickly for 45 minutes, multiple witnesses.;2014-09-01 22:00:00;45 minutes;Multi colored object spotted hovering, speeding up and stopping quickly for 45 minutes, multiple witneses At approximately 10pm I saw a bright round light moving quickly at a 15-20 degree angle over the north horizon.  Originally believed it to be a plane, but it seemed too bright and I didn't notice any blinking lights.  Object came to a full stop in the sky and that is when I started to pay closer attention.  At this time it was the size of a bright planet or star but distinguishably different by its rapidly changing color from white to red to green to blue. After watching for a few minutes, I noticed it begin to move erratically in several different directions at a start/stop speed no plane can move, and no human can sustain.   I called my wife to the window and we both observed it act like this in the same spot in the sky for over 30 minutes.  We also noticed several random pinpoint strobe like flashes in the sky surrounding it during this time.  My wife commented that it was moving like a humming bird or fly would - zigging/zagging and stopping on a dime.  It eventually moved behind the trees and we lost sight of it after 45 minutes or so. Several commercial planes passed by during this time and were obviously different than what we were observing.  It would seem logical with it's brightness and position in the sky that it (the object) was visible from those planes.;44.9863;-92.7277999999999
