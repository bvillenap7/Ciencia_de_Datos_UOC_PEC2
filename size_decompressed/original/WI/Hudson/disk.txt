My daughter called in a panic.  She said there was aliens all around her.  Said how afraid she was yelling can't u see them..  I went outside..  Couldn't believe what I was seeing..   My wife jumped in her car and drove to where my daughter was..one craft was so close to her she cud see it spinning..were very bright like stars but all had reddish orange pulsing lites in the center..  I had my binoculars on them.   They moved from spot to spot but kept positioning themselves like orion.  Then they would seperate all the while the pulsing lites continued.  Approximately 12:40 am the 22nd the clouds started to roll in and they all disappeared..   I've seen many UFO's in my life..  But none like this.. none for this long...or that many together.. Was amazing;44.9863;-92.7277999999999
