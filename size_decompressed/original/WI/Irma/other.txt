We stopped at a local beer house to chew the fat.  We headed out and started our soon to be odd journey to gleason.  we had just passed Irma hill, a BIG landmark in the area, when we heard a very strange sound. It sounded like our transmission fell out of our car and landed few cm from our current location.  A blinding flash filled our soon to be bewildered company and vehicle.  Our car stopped almost immediately. As soon as our car stopped, now illuminated, these beings emerged and appeared to surround our stationary vehicle.  The description of these beings is as follows: 6 feet tall, with a triangular shaped head, and  strange tenticles, not long, on their chin.  They spoke in a somewhat bubbly English voice.  They opened up the door, even though we locked them.  We, at this time, were in a state of complete bewildered and terror, a real revolting witches brew of strange emotions.  We were numb all over except our eyes and ears.  The beings drew some blood from our arms and legs with wierd needle-like precision instruments.   They left our area and we found ourselves 5 miles down the road not knowing or remembering how we got there. ((NUFORC Note:  No return address indicated by the witnesses in this case.  We have been unable to contact them, and there have been no other reports from this area.  Peter));45.3485;-89.6669
