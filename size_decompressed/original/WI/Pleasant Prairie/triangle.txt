Very large triangular object seen in Southeast Wisconsin;2002-09-05 22:55:00;5 minutes;Very large triangular object seen in Southeast Wisconsin It was a very clear night and I went out to my back patio to let the dog out. Within about a minute I saw a triangular group of what I thought was three stars in the northern sky, these were fairly bright compared to others around them. To my surprise, I noticed that all three stars were moving - together. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and looked away. I looked again and realized they were in fact moving and the three stars or lights maintained their exact distance and relationship to each other, as they moved. The shape was a very large thin triangle. As far as its size, holding my arm straight out the object looked like it measured about and inch and a half long and a half-inch wide at its base. It moved slowly through the sky in a southeast direction, with the single light at the front and the two other lights toward the direction it was moving from. All three lights were white and looked just like bright stars - there was nothing visible between them or it may have just been black. The triangle appeared to be very high up in the sky, above normal airplane elevation. I ran into the house and told my wife to come outside, she did. By this time, about 5 minutes after I first saw it, the triangle shape had moved toward the southeast and was nearly straight up in the sky. My wife also saw it and after another 30 seconds or so we lost sight of the triangle, as if it faded or the lights went out. There was no sound and the shape moved fairly slow. Facing north the cities of Milwaukee, then Kenosha, then Pleasant Prairie were under the objects path. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting was caused by the three satellites frequently seen flying in formation.  They are thought to be U. S. Navy NOSS satellites.  Please see other reports from Wisconsin for this date.  PD));42.5313000000001;-87.8852999999999
Me and my brother saw suspicious, hazy blue lights over Lake Michigan.;2012-01-29 22:05:00;10 minutes;Me and my brother saw suspicious, hazy blue lights over Lake Michigan. Me and my brother were home alone eating dinner, when I spotted some strange, blue lights in the sky over Lake Michigan (we live right on the lake). I thought it was just a plane or some stars, but then I realized they were to big and hazy to be stars and they seemed to close to the ground to be a plane.   I showed my brother and we were puzzled as to what they were.   After about ten minutes they just sort of disappeared and we didn't seem them again.   Since we couldn't figure out what thy were, we decided to report to here.;42.5313000000001;-87.8852999999999
