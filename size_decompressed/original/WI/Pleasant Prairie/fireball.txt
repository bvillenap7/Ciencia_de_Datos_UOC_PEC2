Strange light - fireballs seen in Kenosha Wisconsin 2015;2015-05-03 00:01:00;30 minutes;Strange light - fireballs seen in Kenosha Wisconsin 2015 I live in Pleasant Prairie, SE Wisconsin, about 2 miles west of Lake Michigan, and ½ mile north of the Illinois border.   It was just about midnight I was standing on my front porch which faces to the northeast. The night was clear, full moon and the weather was nice, and the sky was mostly clear with very little clouds. From the east over the roof tops in the sky I seen somewhat large (size of a bus) 3 balls of light appear from the east (lake direction) and rising and turning to the north east.  At first they seemed to be in some formation and my initial thought was fireworks, but then they separated slightly as they turned to the northeast and were still rising at a high rate of speed.  My second thought was military as they headed north east and quickly disappearing – the ball of light which seemed like fire became smaller and began to quickly disappear one by one. About 10 minutes later, I saw them again.  Rising from the same place which seemed like it was from over the lake.  I quickly went inside to get my binoculars and by the time I came back they were fading to the northeast like before.  The binoculars did not help much because they were already high in the sky and fading.  The light was a pale yellow like a ball of flame. Then about 10 minutes later my friend who had left earlier before this happened, came back to get something she forgot.  I began to explain what I seen.  Then as we were standing there looking they appeared again.  This time it appeared to be 5 and quickly seemed like 2 disappeared as they headed northeast and disappeared.  I attempted to see them through the binoculars but by the time I focused on them they were too small and just seemed like balls of fire disappearing in the sky. I went into get my camera  and waited at least 20-30 minutes but nothing, they did not reappear.  These were not fireworks, they ‘could’ have been something military but then they made no sound – stealth (we would have heard an engine).  There is nothing over the lake so I cannot explain where they came from.  I have not seen anything like this before and my friend said the same.;42.5313000000001;-87.8852999999999
