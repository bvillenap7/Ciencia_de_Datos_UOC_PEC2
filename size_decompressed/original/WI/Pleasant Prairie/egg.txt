On 05/19/08, at approximately 3:45pm, I was driving through Pleasant Prairie southbound on highway 31 (Green Bay Road) approaching the junction for highway 165 where I needed to turn west to go to my job in the industrial park.  After reaching the highest part of the road before 165 (a bit before Jelly Belly factory) I saw a silver or very shiny object in the sky directly over the road.  It appeared to be maybe 1-3 miles away and maybe 1000 feet in the sky.  The object was sort of egg shaped as it wasn’t quite round.  It sat stationary in the sky.  At first I thought it must be a plane or something else and that it didn’t appear to be moving because I was in motion.  I watched it stay in the same spot up to when I reached 165 and turned west.  I slowed down to a complete stop at the yield and observed the object continue to sit stationary over the road.  I looked back at the road and switched lanes, to the left lane, before the south entrance to Jelly Belly and looked south again and it was still there.  I began to ascend the hill the overpasses the railroad tracks before 80th Ave and looked back again and it was still there.  I then focused on reaching the apex of the hill hoping for a very clear view and when I turned to look it was gone.  I thought maybe it had moved so I kept looking in every direction and could not see it.  I turned south on 80th Ave hoping to catch another glimpse of it but it was gone.  I then continued on my way to work like any other day.;42.5313000000001;-87.8852999999999
