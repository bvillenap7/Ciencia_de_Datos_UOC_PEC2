My wife and I were eating dinner outside overlooking the river to the south. I noticed the UFO over the trees on the Western horizon and alerted my wife to it. We watched as it randomly rocked and spun as it flew straight East until it disappeared over the treeline to the East. The UFO was a seemingly dark, perfectly donut-shaped craft that made no noise and made noticeably quick turns. I ran to the house to get my phone and caught the last few seconds of it on video. After some research it looks like and acts exactly like the UFO in Brooklyn from March 2020.;45.7858;-91.1078
