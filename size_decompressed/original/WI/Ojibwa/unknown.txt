Me and my brother were sitting at the stop sign and we saw these weird lights in the sky. We both new right away it had to be something other than a plane, because there were too many lights. At first it was coming towards us, flying really low & slow, and then it kinds turned to our left, its right. We followed and turned to the right with it along the rode, now it was on my left side, the driver side. It kinda went in that direction for a little bit, still really slow. Then it slowly crossed over us and then was on the right side. It was flying so low, it looked unbelievable. I felt as though i could just reach out the window and touch it. A little bit later it slowly got higher and higher and then it was gone.;45.7858;-91.1078
