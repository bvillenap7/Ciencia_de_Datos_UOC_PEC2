2 Orange fireballs appeared in northeast Wisconsin for approximately 2 minutes.;2013-11-28 20:28:00;2 minutes;2 Orange fireballs appeared in northeast Wisconsin for approximately 2 minutes It looked like two orange/red fireballs equally spaced apart in the eastern sky.   At first I thought I didn't notice cellular towers but these lights were triple the size of the lights on a cellular tower at close range.    I was able to run inside house grab my cousin with whom witnessed this spectacular event with me.   As we gazed at the lights/fireball objects in the sky they dissolved away to nothing.  They didn't seem to be moving at all.;44.7117;-88.1059
