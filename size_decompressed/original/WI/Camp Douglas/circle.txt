Brightness and color changed with the movement. I went outside to smoke a cigarette, and noticed a dot moving in the trees.  I focused on the dot and saw that it was moving, slowly but surely.  The glowing, and color changing dot would make circular motions, and would also pause in between doing so. I tried to call my neighbor so that I wouldn't sound completely crazy if I mentioned it to my family.  He did not pick up the phone. I posted on a social media sight:  I just saw a UFO.   The first person that replied happened to be 15 miles away.  I used my phone's compass function to tell her the direction to look. It took her a few minutes but she confirmed it.  At one point we said, Did you see that? over the phone. I also saw a shooting star about 5 degrees to the left of this object about 5 minutes into gazing at it.;43.988;-90.2446
