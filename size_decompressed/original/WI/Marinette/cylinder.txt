On July 6th, 2000, at sunset, from Chambers Island, Door County, WI, my wife and I observed a very bright cylinder-shaped object above the Wisconsin-Upper Michigan border. The weather was calm, 70 degrees, clear skies. We were looking at a few pink clouds just after sunset when suddenly a very bright cylinder-shaped object appeared at about 30 degrees above the horizon, at the 1 0'clock position above us. I observed the object for about 30 minutes through bioculars.  There were no wings, no windows, no markings, no sound, no contrail. The object had no lights, except for one moments when a reflection from the sun, I assume, beamed out from the side nearest the sun, 9by now set). This bright reflection lasted only a moment, and was replaced by a black line on the leading edge and bottom surface. The object was lilted down and to the left. After a moment, it started to move very slowly from right to left and down toward the horizon. It took 30 minutes to move from its original position  of one o'clock down to the horizon, or seven o'clock, a position a few miles north of Marinette, WI. That was about one degree per minute, way too slow for an airliner, etc. By the time it went over the horizon, it had become pink as well, as it was heading toward and beyond where the sunset position had been. This event was witness by my wife, and was observed in daylight to dusk. It did not vary in speed or direction, and held to its slow, downward tilted descent and speed without change or variation.	;45.0874000000002;-87.6696999999998
