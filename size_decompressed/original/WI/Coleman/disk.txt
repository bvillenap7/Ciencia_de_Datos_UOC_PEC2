Bright light in sky, vertical movement;2001-07-01 22:00:00;seconds;Bright light in sky, vertical movement White disk shaped light with tail on right, like a comet.  I was driving south down highway 141, looked up, saw light in the sky to my right (SW) above the barns and then it dropped straight down and out of sight.  At first I thought it might be a shooting star, but it was faster and dropped straight down, an uncommon movement for a star.  It was brighter than anything in sky.;45.0703;-88.0538
