Cigar shaped, moved slowly.;1972-06-01 20:00:00;5 minutes;Cigar shaped, moved slowly. My son for several nights demanded I look out the window to see the UFO.  I refused. I had seen one in 1967or so and it had freaked me out so badly that I didn't want to look.  Finally one night he just would not be quiet so I looked. I saw a small in the distance cigar shaped object moving slowly.  I got the binoculars and saw that it had three colors, I think.  I remember red or orange and brown, possibly white. It just slowly moved out of sight. It was NOT a plane.  It looked like a cigar.;44.7916;-90.0544
