Fast erratic moving lights that turned off and on.;2018-05-07 20:45:00;30 seconds;Fast erratic moving lights that turned off and on. I was watching what I thought were a couple of helicopter lights, when they flicked off and on and seemed to fly very erratically.  The lights moved very fast and moved back and forth. I have never seen an aircraft move like that.   I then saw about 6 of these lights flick on all at once when all the lights went out I didn't see them anymore.  The lights reminded me of how lighting bugs but they were not lighting bugs.;44.7916;-90.0544
