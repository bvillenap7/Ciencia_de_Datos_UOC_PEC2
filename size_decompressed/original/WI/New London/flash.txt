On Wednesday, February 17, 2016, at approximately 02:00 I took the dog out, and while waiting, observed a bright flash above and slightly to the east of me, no trail, just a flash.  It or another flashed about a second later a little farther to the east, then another a couple of seconds later again farther to the east, again but more to the north of the previous.  It or they continued to move, or appear and disappear would be a better description, to the north a few times then back to the south still way east of the original flashes it/they went behind the tree line in my neighborhood.  These were not satellites or aircraft of any sort, I have been around airplanes all my life and am an aviation technician.  There was no green, red, white or just pulsing white light as would be seen with an aircraft.  It/they did not move in a constant direction or heading as would and aircraft.  Sometimes the flash was dimmer than others a few were very bright flashes.  It was about 6 degrees outside and the sky was crystal clear.  There was no sound whatsoever associated with the flashes.  And they appeared to be or what I would consider to be outside our atmosphere or the edge of it.  Had it been a steady light and moving in a constant heading I would have thought it was a satellite similar in size to when the space station flies over.;44.3929;-88.7573000000001
