flashes of bright yellow stars;2003-02-24 19:00:00;5 min;flashes of bright yellow stars A flash of light apeared while driving mid horizon, it was like a bright large yellow star with a small star on it 11:00 & a dim light at 7:00 clustered together & a second formation apeared idenical about 2:00 from it at some distance a split second later... & then both gone...just when I thought I had been seeing things the same thing acourred only faster & several times in mid horizon... I lost sight because of trees & then saw a few more flashes & then many red lights - possibly jets scrambling... I was at my destination & went in to find some one, by the time I returned outside, no lights in the sky;44.4759;-89.803
