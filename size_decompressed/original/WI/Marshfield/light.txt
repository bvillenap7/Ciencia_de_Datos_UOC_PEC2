Flashing lights in Wood County, WI;2000-12-10 15:00:00;45 sec;Flashing lights in Wood County, WI I was driving with my mother and sister out on a country road by our house.  My mother and sister point out the window at something they see in the sky just above the horizon.   I turn my head and look to see lights zipping back and forth across the sky very quickly.  The lights were flashing and traveling in a straight line and making very quick turns, they were white and red. They soon disappeared.
