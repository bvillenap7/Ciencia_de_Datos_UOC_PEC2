I saw the craft out of the corner of my eye and pointed it out to my boyfriend.  It was shaped like a triangle and had three red lights.  It was flying at about the height a single engine plane would fly and made no sound what so ever.  It was pretty fast, but we had enough time to talk about what was going on while the craft glided by.;44.6617401746726;-90.1790480349346
