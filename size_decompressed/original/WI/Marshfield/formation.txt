((anonymous report));2017-12-07 21:00:00;1 minute;As I was driving on the highway in Marshfield, my friend pointed up into the sky.  I slowed car it was late at night and no one was around, as I looked up high into the sky, I saw a bright orange/red sphere looking shape.  It was moving North at a pretty good speed, all of a sudden it got very bright and it seemed as if it exploded and a bunch of red / orange spheres for now going all over the place.  As I turned off the front lights of my car they were all raining down and it looked like they were picking up speed with a bunch of trails left behind them.  All of a sudden with another bright flash, they were gone the formation they were flying and seemed almost as if a rectangle or a square.
