White lights over Wisconsin.;2012-01-04 21:15:00;3 mins;White lights over Wisconsin. I seen three bright lights in the eastern sky that night. Very clear night.  They were in a line and VERY BIG AND VERY BRIGHT.  Two of them just seemed to move very slowly across the sky to the south.  And one of them went north very fast and when from north to south very far away.  And came back to the other two for about a minute.  And went very fast to the north again out of sight.  There was no sound from any of them.;42.5349;-90.5107
