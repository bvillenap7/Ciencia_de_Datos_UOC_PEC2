As viewed south from city, mid-sky,  flashing, rapidly moving within a small area, appeared to be triangular like motion, alternating colors appearing to be red, blue, white & green. Stayed in basic configuration and location for more than one hour. Much brighter than adjacent stars. No continuation of movement to suggest was an airplane or helicopter. Has us stumped.
