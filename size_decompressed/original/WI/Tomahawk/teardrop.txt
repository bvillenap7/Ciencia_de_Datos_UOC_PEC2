The objects moved at the same speed as a jet would however, they appeared orange colored and seemed to have a flame and made no sound.  We didn't see all 6 at the same time.  We saw one which was followed by another. They moved in a straight line from left to right and we observed them directly over the Dairy Queen.  The two objects would move across the sky and then disappear.  They then reappeared a couple minutes later following a similar path as the first time.  They would also disappear into the clouds before they reappeared again. At first we thought they were possibly aircraft however, they didn't have any navigational lights.  We observed them for about 30 minutes. We were actually able to capture them on video using a cell phone.;45.4927;-89.7215
