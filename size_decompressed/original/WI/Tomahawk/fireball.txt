Further back in the sky there were two extremely bright orange lights traveling east to west in the southern sky.  I stopped my truck and got out to listen and see if they were helicopters or airplanes there were no sounds at all.  The two orange lights stopped and hovered for a while then the red light faded very quickly back toward the two orange lights and they all moved very quickly up into the sky the red turned to brite orange and the two orange faded to light orange then turned white and all three were in a triangular formation high in the sky and appeared to be just stars.  I don't know what I saw but they were not airplanes or helicopters.  The red light when above the tree line seemed to have an intense center energy emanating the deep red light and the outside of the light had a white static electricity like halo around it.;45.4927;-89.7215
