Multi colored silent object moving slowly Northeast.;1977-08-07 21:44:00;2 Min;Multi colored silent object moving slowly Northeast. Traveling south with a friend on Buisness 51 about 3 miles south of Tomahawk when we saw a row of multi colored pulsing lights in a oval /cigar shape to our left above the trees.  Slid my Firebird to a stop on the shoulder and we both jumped out to see.   The silent object glided slowly to the NE and disappeared behind the trees, we drove in that direction but the object was gone.;45.4927;-89.7215
