The craft was an orange orb that was visible for 30 seconds before simply vanishing.  A minute later another orb appeared and traveled the same line that the previous orb had.  This repeated 4 times.  Then a much larger orb appeared traveling a slightly different path before vanishing. the whole event lasted maybe 5-10 minutes.;45.4927;-89.7215
