By the time I got closer to the window, it was now behind the trees out of sight. I just happen to look out the window and saw this neon green circle coming down.  It was only a few seconds and then it was out of sight, behind a bunch of trees. At first I thought someone was intentionally dropping(polluting) something in the lake behind me.  I talk to a few people the next day and by the size of the circle on the window glass, they figured it was much further away. If I stand in the same spot and face the direction (S.E.)that I saw this and draw a line on a map, April 10th a tornado hits 20 miles away in Merril, Wi.
