I was sleeping over at a friends house.  I was just about sleeping when my friend woke me up.  It was at about 2:30 Am.  What we seen were flashing lights above the tree tops.  They were very bright and lasted for about a half hour.  I couldn't tell how many lights there were but an area of about 30 square yards was lit up.  It was just a flickering. While I was calling my dad I looked and there was nothing.  I shouldn't have taken my eyes off it. It really has no logical reason of what this could be.  There was no smoke so it couldn't have been a fire or fireworks.  It was not lightning because it was just in that one spot.  It almost seems that it landed in the woods.  If anybody reads this and seen something similar to what I did please post it.  I never believed in these types of things either until I saw this.  There is a lot of things that we don't know about such as ufos.;44.6397;-90.0150000000001
