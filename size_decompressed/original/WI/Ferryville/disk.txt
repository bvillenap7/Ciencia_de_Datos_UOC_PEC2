UFO hovering over the road;1976-06-30 18:00:00;seconds;UFO hovering over the road We were coming home from Ferryville on County Road B when we saw an object hovering about 15 feet above the road.  As we got closer, about 100 feet away, the craft lifted a few feet and went about 10 feet to the right above a tree on the side of the road.  It stayed there about 3 seconds and then took off across the sky in a slight S pattern and flew out of sight in about a second.  My mom admits seeing something and my dad recalls windows and light along with my details.  My dad said he talk to others in our area that also saw a UFO about the same time that night.;43.3995;-91.0465
