V shaped winking lights.;2008-07-31 21:20:00;30 seconds;V shaped winking lights. As I was driving home last night, at about 9:20 pm, I noticed a strange string of lights near the horizon.  I live near Oshkosh Wi, so I thought maybe it was a plane heading over to EAA.  But then the lights started to wink on and off, in sort of a V shape.  It looked really large too. I lasted just a few seconds and then was gone! There were about 4 or 5 evenly spaced lights in sort of a V pattern, that got closer together each time the blinked, until they dissapeard. This happened right over a small town in Wisconsin called Bancroft.  It is in Portage County.;44.2936;-89.3577
