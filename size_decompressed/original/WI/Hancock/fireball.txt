Lights in the sky.;2012-11-23 18:00:00;3 minutes;Lights in the sky 3 evenly spaced yellow/orange balls in the sky..  They then blinked out and almost immediately 6 evenly spaced appeared.  They blinked out then a rapided progression of 9 appeared. Almost as if they were being fired out somewhere.  I could see what appeared to be multipe small jet lights flying around the area.  There was no noise from either the fireballs or what I would assume were fighter jets. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
