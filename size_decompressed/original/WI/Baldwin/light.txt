I was near a small private airport in Baldwin WI watching several loads of jumpers deploy from 11,000 ft. agl when I noted the bright light about 45 degrees above horizon and bearing about 240 degrees from Baldwin.  This object DID NOT MOVE over an hour and one half of repeated observations. I called this in to your people and also called the nearest FAA Flight Service station in Princeton MN.  I do not know what this was but it was like a star visible at noontime !  There were no clouds.  I am certain the object was well above 11,000 feet agl since the jump planes were clearly below it in altitude when jumpers deployed.  I am certainly no kook but this was a very odd pheonmenon. I am a former private pilot and current skydiving student.  Age 56.  Hold both M.D. and Ph.D.(chemistry) degrees.  I have never seen anything like this before.  Surely this must be a planet or star (?) but the brightness of this silver-white thing was such that it was visible to the naked eye.  I watched it using 8 x 24 binoculars.  It never moved. ((NUFORC Note:  During the telephoned report from Wisconsin, we explored the possibility that the object witnessed might have been the planet, Venus.  The witness was going to attempt to triangulate the object's position, and look on other days in approximately the same area of the sky.));44.965;-92.3676
