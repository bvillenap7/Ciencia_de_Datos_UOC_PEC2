An orange object moved across the sky.;1998-08-01 22:30:00;5-8 minutes;An orange object moved across the sky. I was outside looking at the stars, I noticed what I first thought to be a plane. It appeared to be 3000 to 4000 feet high. It started to move in different directions, and it would also stop. After seeing the object move like this I called my father and my wife outside to see it. We watched it move across the sky a ways and then it moved up then out of sight. We went inside and then came out again aproximately 5 minutes later. We saw two jets moving at high speed towards the area that this object was last seen. One jet was making a return and another jet went towards where the object was. After that we saw what looked like a falling star come from the general area. The orange object made no noise.;45.8719;-89.758
