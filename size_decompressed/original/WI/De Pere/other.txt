Natural orange light in the sky with a part of an aircraft exposed;2019-07-14 01:00:00;Under five seconds;Natural orange light in the sky with a part of an aircraft exposed Friend and I were driving a friend back home after a bonfire and around 1:00 AM when we saw a orange/yellow natural type light in a cloud and when the light was present you could see the bottom of some sort of aircraft. Event only lasted a couple of seconds but was long and clear enough to make out a part of whatever was in the sky. We were in a suburban neighborhood with no high buildings bigger than a two story house. Aircraft looked like the same height as a plane coming to land. I donâ€™t really know how to give a solid altitude estimate but I would say if it was a plane that low you would be able to make out any spelling on the side of it. Other than that sighting nothing else happened. No weird noises or feelings or anything else of that nature.;44.4371000000006;-88.0795000000024
