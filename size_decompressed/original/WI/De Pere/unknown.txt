Only saw object as bright spirally light.;1999-09-06 20:00:00;approx. 1 hr;Only saw object as bright spirally light. Spotted objects in the sky while watching stars and airplanes.  Saw them at different times over about an hours length with binoculars. The planes flew in a striaght pattern.  These fles very zigzagged and fast.  One seemed to stop and align with two other stars then take off again and quickly dissappear.  I have never seen anything like it before much less three.;44.4371000000006;-88.0795000000024
