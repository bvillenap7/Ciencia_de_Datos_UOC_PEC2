Bright “fireball” orb glides above city;2020-06-01 21:38:00;2 minutes 20 seconds;Bright “fireball” orb glides above city As I walked along the city street sidewalks at 9:38 pm I noticed a bright orange orb in the sky.  As I observed for a few moments, I realized it was moving object with an unusual glow traveling across the night sky.  I was curious enough to take out my phone and record almost immediately.  As I record and observe the orb, it glides across the skyline above the city for 2 minutes and 20 seconds.  Can it be a satellite?;44.4371000000006;-88.0795000000024
