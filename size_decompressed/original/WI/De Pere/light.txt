Moving red object in the sky.;2014-03-29 22:00:00;2 minutes;moving red object in the sky I'm a diesel mechanic/master technician.  I have an associate degree in Diesel Technology.  In the northeast sky near the horizon I noticed what appeared to be a reddish star or planet. It was the same size as other stars in the sky.   I noticed it was moving, but not flashing like the light of an airplane would.   So I pulled over and my lady friend and I watched it move west across the sky for about a minute before it flickered and disappeared.   It was definitely not a plane it could possibly have been a sky lantern, but it was curious enough for me to report.  Keep up the good work.;44.4371000000006;-88.0795000000024

Stationary for 25 sec, then gone in <2 sec.  3 observers A bright object was observed in the sky W/SW of our location.  It appeared to be a planet at first, but it appeared much larger than a planet would, and it was already fairly light outside.  I pointed it out to the other two people I was with and after 20-25 seconds, it traveled straight away from us at a very high rate of speed.  It was no longer visible in less than 2 seconds.;44.4371000000006;-88.0795000000024
