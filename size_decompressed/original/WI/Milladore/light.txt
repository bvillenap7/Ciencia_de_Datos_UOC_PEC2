Eratic moving light multiple sitings changes direction at great speeds;2006-03-29 22:00:00;30 minutes;Eratic moving light multiple sitings changes direction at great speeds This is the third siting and I have watched it for hours one time. It is the size of a medium star and shows up in the same location each time. The object moves in circles does loops moves up and down and left to right at what seems to be great speeds. This obeject stays in the same area of the sky and I loose sight of it as it drops below the horizon at about 23:00 to 23:30 hours. We took a drive yesterday trying to figure out how far away it was we traveled 7 miles west and 8 miles south and its location in the sky did not change and it did not become any brighter. Tonight I did pull out the video camera with no luck becuase of the lack of light. I did get 2 still photos that included stars and show that the object has moved in the sky. The object is located in the southwest sky and I would say that it is at 20 to 25 dgrees at 21:00 hours. It is now overcast so I can't get anymore pictures. Has anyone else seen this? Does anyone know what it is?;44.6044;-89.8875
