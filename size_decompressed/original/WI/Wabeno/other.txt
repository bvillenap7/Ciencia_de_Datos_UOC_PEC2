It is very hard to remember the event, but I do remember how I told the story to family members shortly after the event.  My brother and I were traveling on a rural road near our parents home and saw a bright red light through the trees ahead.  As we approached it we saw a very large object hovering at about twice the height of the large trees in the area.  I remember describing it as football shaped and about as large as a football field. We saw many lights other then the large red light.  There was at least one green light and many white lights.  My brother stopped the car just after we had passed under the object. He got out of the car to get a better view, but I could see it fine over my shoulder out of my window.  I remember hearing a very loud jet engine type of sound.  We watched as the object slowly moved back in the direction that it had come from.  The entire incident took about 5 minutes.  One interesting note is that my mother, who often traveled the same road late at night, had reported seeing a ufo several times.  She was too scared to get a good look at it as she hurried home.
