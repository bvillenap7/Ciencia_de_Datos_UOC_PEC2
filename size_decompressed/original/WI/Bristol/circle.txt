Orange glowing objects sighted north of Sun Prairie 12092013 after dusk;2013-12-09 17:45:00;60 seconds;Orange glowing objects sighted north of Sun Prairie 12092013 after dusk Noticed two orange glowing objects shortly after dusk flying northeast from my location somewhat low in altitude from my vehicle while driving home after work. Observed for less than one minute before they disappeared on a clear night before they approached the horizon. I was less than five minutes from my residence and upon arriving at home went out into the yard to double check and observed and heard a military jet cruising through the area. My opinion is they dispatched this jet to investigate these objects.  The base is very close to where I observed the craft.   This is not the first sighting for me for these types of crafts.  My last and only previous sighting was 07042013, when I observed five similar objects in the sky from my residence.;42.5272;-88.0399
