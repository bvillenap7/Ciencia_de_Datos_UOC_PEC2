No heat or glow trails were noted.  The objects were traveling a parallel vector and arranged in a diagonal formation.  It only took a few seconds for them to cross the sky.  I noticed them at 45 degrees inclination, 90 degrees ascension with in a few seconds, they vanished out of sight.;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
