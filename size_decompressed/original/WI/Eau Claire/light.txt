Pair of orange lights over western Wisconsin;2009-03-18 20:30:00;Twenty minutes;Pair of orange lights over western Wisconsin While driving between St. Paul, Minnesota, and Eau Claire, Wisconsin, two of us observed two orange lights, larger and brighter than any stars, due east in the sky several miles away. The pair of lights, at the first observance, seemed to travel south in a leap-frog pattern, then disappeared. Several minutes later, they reappeared travelling much closer together, but disappeared within ten seconds.  As we waited for their next appearance, I saw four to five planes (white blinking lights, assuming they were planes) travel to that area and stay in the area. One of the orange lights appeared again several degrees further south, then disappeared after only a few seconds, and I watched as the assumed planes headed in that direction.  Over the course of the next hour, I waited and the orange lights did not return and the planes left the area.;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
2 separate bright round lights moving quickly in straight lines SW to NE 2 min. apart.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS sighting?  PD));2009-07-10 22:15:00;1 minute;two separate bright round lights moving quickly in straight lines southwest to northeast 2 minutes apart At night, saw a total of two large (larger than any planets, stars, or other aircraft) round, very bright white lights moving across sky in straight lines in separate occurrences about 2 minutes apart. They were above the clouds  no sound  no strobe lights like aircraft would have.  Moved from southwest to northeast over Eau Claire although on slightly different trajectories.  They each moved at a fairly fast, and constant, rate of speed and were out of view in about 2 minutes. One witness says he has seen lights like this before over Eau Claire several times in the last 15 years.  The other witness has never seen lights like these before. One witness ran for binoculars.  Through binoculars lights just looked like bright lights  no further detail could be seen. Unusually bright areas of lightning followed the sightings in the west, northwest, and north within 15 minutes.  Then clouds moved in and there was a mild thunderstorm with mild rain. Observers were out in the yard with pets when lights were seen.  Both observers are former Air Force members, in medical professions, not flight professions.  They live in an area with lots of overflight of aircraft and these lights are not consistent with any typical overflying aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  ISS visible at 21:45 hrs. and 23:21.  PD));44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
