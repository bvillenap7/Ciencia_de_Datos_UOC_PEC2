Visiting in Eau Claire, WI we were outside around 11pm. Enjoying spring weather. The night sky had a hint of thin clouds. The moon was about 60%. There were plenty of stars visible. I happened to look at the western sky which was towards Minneapolis and St. Paul and I saw 3 unusual lights coming towards us. I told friend to look as they were flying in a tight formation and at a speed that appeared to be at least 4 to 5 times that of airlines. We both watched as they flew from west to east in a tight formation. How could I know their altitude? I would guess 30 to 40 thousand feet. When they got near above us they changed places and revolved. They appeared triangular. They maneuvered in a precise manner. I have seen planes do stunts but nothing this precise at such a speed. They went back to a straight formation but a few seconds later maneuvered again. It was amazing and we needed to share this but unfortunately we had no camera. There was no sound nor contrails. They disappeared to our eyes but that was probably due to the thin layer of clouds and the distance. It appeared to me that what I saw was 3 individual lights but they moved as one. I have seen satellites, planes, meteors, and some other things I couldn't explain. But this was special. I would like to know if others saw this or if any radar from military, airlines, or pilots saw this. We made the comment that if not extraterrestial then it has to be something very special that we have.;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
Arrow shape flying fast;2007-10-21 04:00:00;10 seconds;Arrow shape flying fast I was outside and just happend to look straight up in the sky and notice what looked to be a triangle or arrorw formation flying quickly through the sky. I'm pretty sure it was 7 lights orangish lights flying in perfect tangen. It could have been one space craft or several in perfect formation. This thing could not have been man made because it flew so fast... I saw it go across most of the sky and out of view in less than 10seconds. It was flying much higher then a plane and I coulden't hear anything... Kinda weird how I looked up just then.;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
