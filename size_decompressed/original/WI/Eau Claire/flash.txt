2 Bright Flashes near Eau Claire, WI;2018-01-28 22:30:00;1 second;2 Bright Flashes near Eau Claire, WI I saw a bright flash about 22:30 out my window.  My first thought was that it was a firework, but there was no noise at all and when I went outside to see if anything else was going on, there was nothing.   My wife then saw a bright flash shortly before sunrise the next morning, 1/29/18 around 06:00.  She had the shades drawn in that room, but said it was bright enough to light up the whole room.  She also said she did not hear any noise associated with it.   We live at the top of a hill, so it could not have been headlights from a vehicle.;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
