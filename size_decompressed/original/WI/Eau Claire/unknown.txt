On Monday, the night of July 15, 1996, at about 11:02 central time, I witnessed an unidentified object heading due west which I could not explain.  I was out with my neighbor looking at the sky that night(it was perfectly clear with no clouds) and I was looking off to the east when my neighbor called to my attention an object flying silently over us heading east.  He said he saw it when it was at mid-sky and from then on we both saw it head west.  We could not make out any shape, but it had four distinct, orange lights that made a diamond shape.  The way the lights were positioned and the fact that none of them were blinking made me want to rule out the fact that it might be an airplane, because to my knowledge, I don’t know of any planes that don’t have blinking beacon lights on the tail, wing, or somewhere. 	The lights were of an orange color and didn’t move, blink, or change color the whole time the craft passed over(it took about 8 seconds for it to get from mid-sky to over the tree tops where we couldn’t see it).  The craft flew silently over us, and we could here no noise what so ever.  The object made no noise so, if it would have been a small airplane, much less a jet, we would have surely heard it, because it was not very high up.(between 600 and 700 ft.) 	After we watched it pass over, I ran in the house to tell my brother(who, unfortunately had gonet in the house ten minutes earlier) what we had saw. He was disappointed and we both went outside again.  Once we were out, my neighbor told me he had seen another one, in the same position and place, and heading in the same direction.  I’m not sure whether or not he actually did see another one(or the same one again), but I do know what I saw, and I’ll bet money it wasn’t an airplane.;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
Slow, silent blinking lights return again in Eau Claire;2005-07-18 10:47:00;5 minutes;Slow, silent blinking lights return again in Eau Claire Please see previous report filed from Eau Claire about strange blinking lights, silent aircraft, filed I believe in March or April of 2005. Saw the same distinct objects as in the last report. Instead of seeing six tonight like last time, I saw 2. I instantly recognized them from last time, this is the third overall sighting.  Same blink pattern as before. White white red. white white red.  Seemed to be just slightly larger than last time and it looked like a triangle wedge shape, but it would be impossible to know for sure without binoculars.  No sounds, smooth and silent and slow (It seemed they would cross the width of a full moon in about 7 seconds). Crafts were heading Northeast on the same course it appeared.  The 2nd object was about 2 minutes behind the 1st object (2 min to get to same place in sky).  The 2nd craft crossed opposite paths with what looked to be a satellite or the ISS heading in the opposite direction, but then that object got dimmer. Again I find myself wishing I had a telescope. Would be interested to hear if anyone else has seen these.;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
Orange lights appear over Eau Claire, WI on September 10, 2013.;2013-09-10 22:15:00;30 minutes;Orange lights appear over Eau Claire, WI on September 10, 2013. At approximately 2215 hr, I was sitting on the end of my driveway in Eau Claire, WI, (USA)(lat N44^ 51' and W91^ 30'), when I saw 8-10 bright orange lights approaching from the west, from approximately 260 deg.  These lights appeared to be following the lead light.   My upward angle of perception was approximately 120 deg due to trees to the west and to the east of my location.  There were broken clouds, height 3000 ft ???   The bright orange lights were above the broken clouds and it took approximately 1 min from the time of first perception to the time they disappeared.  The lights appeared to have a very faint white light that was traveling with them behind the second or third orange light, and resembled a very faint white star that was very far away.   I watched this group of orange lights as they disappeared from my perview, a few minutes later, more appeared.  This continued for several minutes, ending at approximately 2245 hr.  During this time, there were absolutely NO SOUNDS DETECTED.  In addition, they were moving too fast to be Chinese Lanterns.;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
