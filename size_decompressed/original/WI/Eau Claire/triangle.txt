Mostly stationary triangle crafts over Eau Claire Wed 2/23/11;2011-03-23 22:00:00;Several hours;Mostly stationary triangle crafts over Eau Claire Wed 2/23/11 Observed at least four trangle-shaped objects in the sky over north side of Eau Claire Wednesday night - other observer believed they were starts with clouds moving over them, but I looked more closely and for longer.  I saw them 2 more times, each an hou or so apart. The most activity was around 10pm, when two of the crafts seemed to merge.  Green and red lights blinking and replacing each other.  They seemed to be just be sitting in one spot. There weren't any planes/jets flying at theat time as far as I know. it was very eerie...

Evenly spaced triangle low in the sky with flashing lights.;2012-08-07 22:00:00;Unknown;Evenly spaced triangle low in the sky with flashing lights. Driving home from baseball game saw a perfect triangle of lights evenly spaced out.  The top of the triangle was facing up and all three lights strobed. Low to middle of the sky (lower than all the stars). Dont know exactly how long it was there because we noticed it as we were driving and when we got home decided to go back out and look for it and it was gone.  It was in the sky for at least a half hour. Saw 3 cars pulled over, not sure if they were looking at it or it was just chance.  My cousin (14) first noticed it then I (19) did. Called up my friends (19 and 20) that were in my same area and they also noticed it. We are all in to UFO's and knew the classic triangle formation when we saw it.  This was my first encounter where i was 100% confident it was a UFO.;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
