Four oval orange lights seen near Eau Claire Wi;2013-10-19 00:00:00;3 minutes;Four oval orange lights seen near Eau Claire Wi I drive truck on a route everynight and get back to Eau Claire about 12:00 ti 12:30 Am.   I travel on highway 29 and was getting onto the off ramp when I notice two very orange oval shape lights approaching my postion.   I pulled over and turned my truck off. I got out and watched two of these oval objects pass over me and then they dissappered.   They made no sound, moved about as fast as a small plane and were very bright orange.  I am positive they were not a plane or helicopter.  I got a very good look at them.   As soon as the first two disappeared another group of two came from the same direction and did the same as the first.   I have never seen anything like this before .;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
Prism-colored spinning lights.;2020-04-19 03:30:00;every night to current;Prism-colored spinning lights It was early Sunday morning, 4/19/20. It was about 3:30 AM when I suddenly woke up to a prism-like-colorful, oval-type object in the sky above our field.  Scared, but also curious, I grabbed a pair of binoculars and looked at the object that was still pulsating its colors. I then went to grab my phone to try to possibly take a picture and right before I was going to leave the window to do that, a bright spotlight came out from it and lit up our front field. (This happened one other time, but I didn't report it.) I was so excited, that I anticipated it the next night (Sunday evening - less than 24-hours later) and have watched it each night since (Today is Wednesday, 4/23/20). Last night I sent a Facebook Message to a neighbor who has regularly witnessed crafts and lights over our house to see if she could see anything.  She said, Yes! It's right out my window. And then told me her husband had also witnessed it over the past few days (without me s! haring my previous evening experiences). I also want to share that randomly, a military plane (in the dusk, Tuesday evening), showed up and flew in the direction of where I had witnessed the craft.;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
