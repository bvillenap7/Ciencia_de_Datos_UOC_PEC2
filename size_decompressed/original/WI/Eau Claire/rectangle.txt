Lights: 1 front, 1 on each side, 1 in back. My neighbor and I were standing half way down my driveway when we saw this object fly overhead due west.  The sky was clear with no clouds.  It didn't have any blinking beacon lights, and we could not make out shape.  The 4 lights were orange/yellow color, somewhat bright, and and they were positioned in the shape of a diamond around the object.  It was very low, compared to most aircraft that fly, at night, and made no sound.  We viewed it for about a 7 or 8 second duration, in which time it just flew over our heads and over the trees out of our view.  I do not know what the object was,because I figured that if it was airplane flying at night, it would have beacons, which the object i saw did not.  And it went very slow for the altitude it was at, which must not have bee more than a few hundred feet up.  To this day, i have never again seen an air-plane or jet fly at night with no blinking beacons and lights at the head, each wing tip, and tail.;44.8224753374227;-91.5072263803716
