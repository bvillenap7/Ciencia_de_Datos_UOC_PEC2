Then they turned (rotated Was looking south from Patch St and Welsby Ave and saw a line of six lights running east to west.  Then they turned (rotated) clock-wise and vanished.  They re-appeared in the same position... then stopped rotation.   Then off to the south-west a single light appeared and headed toward the group of six.  The group of six lights began to rotate again in a clock-wise position.  As they started to merge.... POOF both vanished and I never saw them again.   Come and stand at Patch and Welsby and look straight down Welsby and a bit to your left..... that was where I saw what I did. Want to see the site???
