Intensely white round object moving over 4-lane highway in daylight and hit my car.;2016-08-26 19:31:00;8 seconds;Intensely white round object moving over 4-lane highway in daylight and hit my car On August 26, 2016, at 19:31 hours, I was driving north in the right lane on I-39 going around Stevens Point, traveling about 69 mph.  Where this sighting occurred, I-39 is actually going in an East-West direction.  There was no precipitation and relatively clear sky.  The sun would soon be setting at about the 9 o’clock position to my car.  The distant trees and buildings on the south side of the road in this location would block the sun from coming into my car. I noticed at about the 11 o’clock position, there was an intensely bright white round-shaped object about 600’ away and moving relatively slow in an easterly direction about 25’ above the ground. When I noticed it, it appeared to be about 20” in diameter and just beyond the south side of the road. It then dipped down, then up to about 40’ above the ground, greatly picking up speed as it then curved to the North/NE and passed over the ‘south-bound’ lanes.  As it moved over the approximately 50’ of median plus road shoulders it dipped downward coming directly towards my car and hitting the middle of my windshield, glancing off, and continuing NE in a straight line.  As it hit it made a very loud, heavy ‘dunk’ sound followed by a ‘clink’.  From my right side window, I saw it go straight to the NE and then was out of my sight.  At the moment of impact, from the loud sound I had braced for the windshield to break apart or at the very least be cracked.  To my amazement it didn’t break ! apart.  I continued approximately two miles to my destination and examined the windshield.  I could not find a single trace of anything on it: no breakage, cracks, or smudges of any type. When I first saw the object, I thought it was a large bird.  However, as I continued to watch it as it crossed the south-bound lanes and get closer, it appeared to diminish to about 6” in diameter with what appeared to be a heavy 6” tail like that of a comet’s dust tail by the time it hit my car.  I don’t know if it actually had a heavy ‘dust trail’ or if that was my brain trying to track its movement.  I do know that with it coming within 24” of my face there were no wings, feathers, beak, eyes, feet, or anything remotely resembling a bird or of any other color:  Just a very intense white ball-shape.  In addition, when fowl or animals hit a vehicle, they usually hit with a ‘thud’ sound due to the compression of soft tissue.  And a bird’s beak usually hits before or during impact, not afterward and usually has a different sound other than the ‘clink’ I heard.  Plus there will usually be some type of smudge or residue on the glass.  I was very puzzled by whatever it was that I saw and hit my windshield, but since there was no damage done,  I chalked it up to being ‘unknown’.  That changed October 22, 2016, with a similar sighting at night.  October report filed separately.;44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
Intensely white round object moving about 30' above tree tops in residential area;2016-10-22 00:55:00;5 seconds;Intensely white round object moving about 30' above tree tops in residential area On October 22, 2016, at 0:55, my 21 year old son and I were driving home.  I was driving he was sitting in the front passenger seat.  We were traveling north on a street one block from our destination at about 20 mph.  At the north end of the street is an intersection with a row of houses going east-west.  To the north of those houses is farmland. We had made the last turn north to our destination.  About 100’ north of the turn, at about the 9 o’clock position, we saw a very intense white ball-shaped object about 50’ to the west of the road.  It appeared to be about 20” in diameter.  It stood out in the total darkness.  Because we had just come out of an Orionid meteor shower, my first thought was this was part of that.  However, my family stargazes at night and have never seen anything without some sort of downward curve.  I also recalled my encounter during daylight two months earlier both objects were alike.  It was moving straight north no more than about 30’ above the tree tops and traveling up to about twice our speed.  It was not descending or moving in a downward angle.  We watched it as we continued on about 400’.  The trees and final house then blocked our view.  It appeared to have an approximately 16” heavy tail like that of a comet’s tail, but I don’t know if it actually did, or if that was my brain’s perception of a! blur in tracking it and it was actually more of an oval-shape.   This incident occurred about 3 miles as-the-crow-flies from an August daytime incident which I have filed separately.;44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
Bright white sphere flying above street.;2017-06-15 19:30:00;1.5 minutes;Bright White Sphere Flying Above Street. Our two-story house sits on the north side of a street that goes east/west.  We are directly at the end of a T intersection.  Another street starts at this intersection and goes south. On June 15, 2017, at 19:30 (7:30pm), I was doing some planting in front of the house.  The sky was clear and the sun was nowhere in my line of vision.  Standing, I had turned and was facing a large flat window on the house, about 3.5’ from me.  The window faces south.  Because of the thermal properties of the window, during daylight it is difficult to see anything inside, and everything outdoors is clearly reflected back.   I happened to be looking at the distinction of everything reflected and saw a bright white sphere, approximately 20” in diameter, travel east to west about 35’ directly above our street.  It was traveling about 41 mph, if my calculations are correct.  It did not waver up, down, or side-to-side.  It appeared to be following the street.  There was a slight visual softness about it that I consider to be an aura.  It produced no audible sound.   I turned around to face the street and search the sky to see if it might return.  I’m still standing there one minute later (with the house to my back) when directly above me I see the sphere re-appear about 10’ above my house, going north to south at the same speed as before and again, absolutely no audible sound.  This time, when it gets to where the edge of the street starts in front of the house, without hesitating it dips down about 5’ and continues to fly straight south.  I noticed, instead of flying directly over the road like it did when it went from east to west, it flew about 15’ to the west side of the north/south road and flew just above the tree tops.  There did not appear to be any comet’s-type tail or other lights, only a complete bright white sphere.  I immediately recognized it as being the same type as I had encountered twice previously. This sphere is the same, if not identical, as what I saw and had hit my car while driving on the interstate on August 26, 2016, (3 miles away but also at the same time of day - please see that report) and also on October 22, 2016, (same location as now on the street that intersects with ours but during the night and that one flew south to north and further to the west off the intersecting street – was also witnessed by another person – please see that report). For more than 20 years, we often stargaze at night, watching stars and satellites.  These white spheres are unlike anything we’ve ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we were impressed by her apparent sincerity.  We suspect that she is a very capable, and reliable, witness.  She corrected the date to June 15, 2017, and we have amended the date above.  PD));44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
