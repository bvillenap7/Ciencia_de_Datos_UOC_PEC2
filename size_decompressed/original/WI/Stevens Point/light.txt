Goldish orange light in the southeast sky.;2003-12-01 19:30:00;10 Minutes or more;Goldish orange light in the southeast sky. Driving south on I39, I noticed a bright light in the southeast sky.  It was the brightest thing in the sky, but no brighter than mars was at it's full intensity.  I was trying to figure out if it could possibly be an airplane going for a landing or a planet (not sure what is going on astronomically these days) and driving and trying to watch for deer.  The object didn't appear to be moving, but the light (goldish orangish)did vary in intensity.  I calculated it to be in almost a direct line with Orions dagger which was pointing in a southerly ground direction so I could go home and see what planet it might be.  It suddenly disappeared.  No clouds in the sky...half moon in the other half of the sky.  Strange. ((NUFORC Note:  A perfect description of the dramatically bright, twinkling star, Sirius.

Two nocturnal lights almost intersect - one becomes ten times brighter.;2005-01-13 18:05:00;2 minutes;Two nocturnal lights almost intersect - one becomes ten times brighter. I arrived home at 18:05 and noticed an unusual amount of air traffic in the night sky. There were five objects moving in different directions.  Three of the objects were clearly aircraft, with each having multiple red and white lights (one or two blinking on each object).  However, a fourth object - a single white, non-blinking light, which appeared twice as bright as the aircraft lights, and was at a higher altitude - moved from west to east in a straight line. (From time to time, it seemed to zig-zag slightly, and this may have been an atmospheric effect, but I did not see this effect when watching the other four objects.)  As the west/east light entered the eastern part of the sky, a fifth object - a smaller, non-blinking white light - moved south to north through the eastern sky in a straight line, on a path and at a speed where it would meet the west/east light. Before this could happen, however, this fifth, south/north light grew very bright (about ten times brighter) and then quickly faded out. The west/east light, after crossing the point where it would have met the south/north light, also faded out. I thought clouds could account for these disappearances, but I immediately checked local and regional radar at Wunderground.com, and the skies were what they appeared to be: Clouds: clear. Visibility: 10 miles.  I also thought that the steady brightness of the west/east and south/north lights could be fuselage reflections of the sun - but sunset was one hour and thirteen minutes earlier, at 16:42. Both objects, though higher in altitude than the three aircraft, were much lower in altitude than satellites I have watched from the same location.;44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
During a break at work I noticed a bright light over the tree line. I thought it was odd because I never noticed a star there before.;2016-11-15 18:45:00;25 seconds;During a break at work I noticed a bright light over the tree line.  I thought it was odd, because I never noticed a star there before.  It was about as bright as Venus. Then one after another a 2nd light appeared than a 3rd & 4th. Shortly after wards to the right another set of lights 1 light lit then a 2nd , 3rd then 4th.  Then after the second set of lights lit up it was as though someone hit a light switch and all the lights went out. It was pretty dark out so I couldn’t make out the shape of the craft.  But I do know it wasn’t a helicopter.  There was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate!  PD));44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
Orange lights over Plainfield, WI.;2017-12-07 20:40:00;2 seconds;Orange lights over Plainfield, WI. As I walked to my car after leaving work, something caught my attention.  I was looking directly south up into the sky and noticed 4 balls of orange light, about the same color as a street light far into the distance and high in elevation.  The clouds around them could be seen from the light they cast, as it looked like they were sitting atop a bank of clouds looking over the surroundings.   Three of the lights were in vertical formation and the other was offset behind them to my left.  The offset one disappeared, followed by the three in formation simontaniously.  It was like once I noticed them, they disappeared.  They looked to be off in the distance of Plainfiel, WI, or even further south.   The only other outworldly thing I have seen was too in this direction of Plainfield.  The lights seemed to act in a similar way as the ones I saw over a year ago but this time is was at night and they were orange instead of bright white.;44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
