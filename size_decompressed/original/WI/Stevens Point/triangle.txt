3 white lights in triangle or arc shape flying low;2020-03-02 19:45:00;10 minutes;3 white lights in triangle or arc shape flying low Driving in my car along a populated road coming into town when I saw THREE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS in a mid size arc or triangle formation.  Following the craft it appeared to be no more than 5,000 - 10,000 feet of the ground, making the craft look very large.  After following the craft for about 10 minutes it eventually turned and pointed West before disappearing while leaving a blur of its white lights visible.  A few minutes after a craft with two red lights -which I believe is a military craft- flying west towards where the white light craft was. I was definitely not alone in this sighting. It was moving through a populated area and thief were other cars also following the craft with me.;44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
