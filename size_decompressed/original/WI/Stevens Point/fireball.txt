Orange fireball travels west then north.;2011-07-15 21:15:00;2 minutes;Orange fireball travels west then north. 9:15 pm, after dusk.  Sky completely overcast (low) ahead of a storm cell moving in from the west/northwest.  Calm, no winds (dead air).  Orange fireball, with white and yellow bright spots, traveled from the east to the west (opposite direction of approaching storm) to a point over the center of the city (almost overhead), then made a wide turn and traveled north.   It disappeared above the northern part of the city by flickering out, then in, then out, then in, then out.  It was a bright fireball (almost as intense as a road flare), at the altitude of most of the small planes I see above my neighborhood (they use the municipal airport northeast of the city) and about half the size of a small plane.  Its speed was the same or a little faster than the speed of a small plane.  No landing or navigation lights were visible. A neighbor, his daughter, and I saw two of these orange fireballs the night of July 3rd, traveling one behind the other, north to south, in the eastern sky.  We believed they were Chinese lanterns.  I have no explanation for what I saw tonight.;44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
Addendum to report filed July 15th, 2011;2011-07-15 21:15:00;2 minutes;Addendum to report filed July 15th, 2011 Last night, I emailed a copy of my original report to my brother, who responded this morning:   Inspite of the storm, the prevailing winds were from the SSE at the time. and winds at different altitudes, (layers) will affect the apparent direction of illuminated objects when viewed from below. Why do you believe that this phenomena is anything but man made? eg. lanterns/orbs....   I replied:  Like I said, I have no explanation. It first traveled west, made a wide turn, and then traveled north.  Ninety-degree change in direction. SSE winds at the time were 0 MPH and no gusts.   I checked Weather Underground right away, because I thought it had to be a Chinese lantern.  I suppose a SSE wind at altitude could have interacted with approaching NNW storm winds, causing the fireball's change in direction.  But then, it's reasonable to think there would have been something erratic about its change of direction - if it was a floating object like a Chinese lantern.  Visible bobbing, stalling, weaving.  There wasn't.   The fireball maintained constant speed and altitude, and followed a perfect straight/elbow/straight path.;44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
Second Addendum to report filed July 15th, 2011;2011-07-15 21:30:00;2 minutes;Second Addendum to report filed July 15th, 2011 July 19th, 2011.  Aprox. 9:30 PM.  Two neighbors and I observed an orange fireball, slowly traveling East to West in the northern sky.  Toward the Northwest, it stalled and faded out.  We all agreed it was a Chinese lantern.  One of the neighbors said he had recently seen Chinese lanterns being launched from Emerson Park, which is Northeast of my neighborhood.  The appearance and probable point of origin of this July 19th fireball matched what I, a neighbor, and his daughter observed on July 3rd (traveling North to South in the eastern sky), as well as what I observed on July 15th (traveling East to West and then turning North, almost directly overhead).   So I'm now convinced my July 15th sighting was a Chinese Lantern.  Not an extraordinary object, but an ordinary one displaying an extraordinary flight path and characteristics (likely due to the interaction of winds at altitude).;44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
2 orange lights silently pass over Stevens Point, WI;2012-09-07 22:00:00;10 minutes;2 orange lights silently pass over Stevens Point, WI I was out jogging through the south side of Stevens Point, and as I ran from south to north on side streets, I saw a bright orange light coming up over the tree tops and buildings ahead of me.  There is a municipal airport on the north side of the city, so low-flying small aircraft are a very common sight.  If the light had been white, I wouldn't have given it a second look, assuming that it was just a small plane that had taken off from the airfield. Although its color seemed unusual, it behaved like other low-flying aircraft I've seen at night, proceeding in a steady, straight line, moving north to south, right over the neighborhood I was passing through.  I stopped running and watched it, expecting to see wing lights blinking, that the orange light was just so much brighter that it obscured them.  Although the orange light seemed to very slightly pulse a few times, there were no other colored lights, nothing blinking. I watched it silently pass overhead, turning myself around to face south, until it was obscured by nearby trees.  The entire 'sighting lasted approximately one minute.  I continued on my run. Less than 5 minutes later, as I still ran north, I saw another bright orange light, again coming from the north and moving south!  I stopped immediately to watch it, and it looked and behaved almost exactly as the first one I'd seen.  It also seemed as though it could've been a low-flying, single-engine airplane with orange headlights on.  It seemed to follow the exact same path as the first light, and also made no sound whatsoever. The only difference this time was that, when it was directly overhead, the strength of the light started fading.  It dimmed very rapidly as it continued to move until I could no longer see it.  It reminded me of watching a satellite passing overhead on a clear night, as it moves in a perfectly straight line, and then slowly gets dimmer and dimmer until it is no longer visible.  Maybe the first light also did this, but I could not see it because of the trees. It was a beautiful chilly night, with little to no breeze, and a crystal clear, cloudless sky full of stars: a perfect night for a run, and it turned out to be a very memorable run!;44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
