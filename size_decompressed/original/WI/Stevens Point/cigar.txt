Cigar Siting above house;2004-11-01 04:06:00;5 minutes;Cigar Siting above house I saw a flying cigar-shaped thing on my way to school. 2 of my other friends saw it as well. It was shimmering and change colors periodically, usually from dark colors to light colors back to dark colors. Several black helicopters flew nearby the object. It seemed to be very close to the roof of a nearby house. It floated for a while, then zipped up into the sky and I didn't see it after that.
