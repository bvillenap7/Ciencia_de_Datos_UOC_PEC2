Bubble looking objects that kept their sphere shape.;2013-06-15 11:00:00;1 hour;Bubble looking objects that kept their sphere shape. One morning setting up to open the restaurant, an employee from the kitchen was outside in the back of the building and somehow he noticed several bubble-like objects flying near the sun's rays. Immediately, he told the other employees, including myself, to all come outside and get a glance of these objects.  I looked up and saw several of these bubble looking objects flying close to the sun's rays in the same direction.  They didn't seem to veer off with the wind and it seemed like they were traveling west from our location.  It was a very bright and clear morning, and it was hard to focus on the objects for too long because of the sun.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen before.;44.5237309677414;-89.5570195698923
