Bright green light descending toward earth at 45 degree angle.;2015-11-23 18:33:00;2-3 seconds;Bright green light descending toward earth at 45 degree angle. Driving south along I-43, saw bright green light descending toward earth.  Appeared to be a firework at first, but it traveled pretty quick downwards at a 45 degree angle, light vanished, but appeared to be something in the sky after the light was gone.  Was no more than couple hundred feet in the air.  Was not a firework because fireworks blow up, create multiple lights, and do not travel at a 45 degree angle.  They travel in an arc and eventually die out.  This had the same brightness throughout till the light vanished.
