I came across the description below and it describes Exactally what I saw!  Can you tell me if this could have been a falling star?  It was such a noticable flash of color that I saw it from at least 15 feet back from my living room window.  The room was also lit with two lamps and the light was still bright enough for me to notice it.  I watched it as I walked to the window and had a few seconds to describe what I was seeing to my mom (I was talking with her on the phone), so I was able to view it for longer then a normal falling star.  It seemed so low.   white/green ball with trailing tail and falling debris -slow moving  I have been a MUFON Investigator, and am an Electrical Eng. and Sailor of Lake Superior with 30 years experience. Ball of light at approximately 2,000ft. (under clouds). It moved at a percieved rate of about 1 inch/sec. as I saw it. White ball turning greenish towards end. It had a long thin trail, but the curious thing was that it dropped debris as it flew by. This debris was a constant curtain of burning material that decreased to the rear of the ball. There was no sound. It appeared that the object was a low-mass object..it's speed did not seem right for the size etc. After a 5 sec. period, it simply blinked out..and the falling material actually continued for less than a second after it blinked out ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the correct date for the event is October 04th, 2006.  Report was submitted on October 04, but witness indicates a date of November 12, 2006.  We are confused, although the witness seems to us to be quite serious-minded, and the report seems genuine.  We have written the witness, requesting a correction of the date.  PD));45.1228000000001;-92.5370000000001
