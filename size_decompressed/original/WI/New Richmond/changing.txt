Four, very bright, lights all in a vertical row, in the sky. One by one, they faded and started to look like airplanes. And one by one, they flew off in the same direction. Small blinking lights were seen around them. ((NUFORC Note:  Later report from same witness follows.  PD)) Four bright lights, all in a vertical row, faded into changing colors and flew of in the same direction every time. My friend, grandma, and I were on my deck when I spotted four very bright lights shining through the window in the east. All in a row. We went out side, and they were all in a vertical line. Starting from the top, they faded off, one by one, and started to look like air planes, but they changed colors. They separatly flew off to the south west. The last one stayed longer than the other three.;45.1228000000001;-92.5370000000001
