A saucer shaped object with changing colored light remained in one position in the sky for over an hour.;2009-05-04 23:00:00;1 hour 15 minutes;A saucer shaped object with changing colored light remained in one position in the sky for over an hour. I saw this same object when living in Texas. I was outside on my padio enjoying a beautiful starry night. I noticed a bright light in the east that was different than the stars so I went inside and got my binoculars. When I looked through them I could see what appeared to be a saucer shape with lights of different colors. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it remained in the same spot for the hour and fifteen minutes that I watched it.
