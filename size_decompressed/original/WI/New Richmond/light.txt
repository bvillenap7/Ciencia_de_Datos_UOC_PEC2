Amber colored light in New Richmond, Wi.;2013-08-03 23:30:00;5 minutes;Amber colored light in New Richmond, Wi. At the above time and date my son and I were leaving Cedar Lake Speedway, as we were walking to our car something brighter in the sky caught me eye.  I first watched it for a minute and noticed a amber colored almost a two part section oval shape floating in sky.   No noise, no red/green/white FAA lights.  It seemed to gain altitude and then disappeared in to the clear sky.  It reappreared shortly afterwards and did not seem to gain distance in the sky and did it again and did not reappear afterwards. I tried to get other peoples attention to look up in the sky and witness this with us but no one wanted to look up. After receiving a email from World Net Daily about the lights over this past weekend.  I finally decided to file a report.  Did not think no one would believe my son and I.;45.1228000000001;-92.5370000000001
