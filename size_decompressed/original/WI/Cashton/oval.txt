PD));2009-07-25 21:40:00;15 minutes;3 lights coming from the north to south east,. 2 red,  1 white, total time 15 minutes, all seperate sightings. I called the hot line to report this today 7/28/09. Saturday night July 25th around 9:40 pm CDT my husband and I were driving to our house on a ridge top in western Wisconsin. I noticed to the north a light that was heading south east. This light was white.  I watched it for a few seconds and then remarked to my husband, “look at the light, but it does not appear to be a plane, it has no blinking lights”. The light was lower than a satellite…but because it was a way in front of me it appeared to be airplane height. The light went off to the east and disappeared. We drove into our driveway got out of the car, my husband went into the house to let the dogs out and I stood there. I looked up and from the north came a red light toward me. I called to my husband “look”. We both watched the light approach us, it appeared to be low, and it was red, round, not blinking and no sound. Its size was bigger than a star….medical helicopter size. We watched 15 seconds or so as it headed in a south east direction. I started to walk the dogs to the north looked up and there was another light.  I called to my husband “its back”….it came from the north, red, low, round, no sound, not blinking…flying steady. It headed in a south east direction above me. Same dimensions as the first light….really identical. Both sightings from the house were just a few minutes apart. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.
