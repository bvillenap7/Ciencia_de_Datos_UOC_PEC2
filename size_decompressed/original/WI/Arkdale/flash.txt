Satellite type UFO that flashed bright white several times across the sky;2013-06-25 01:00:00;25 seconds;Satellite type UFO that flashed bright white several times across the sky A friend and I were sitting in our hot tub and looking at the stars. We see satellites frequently and know what they are when we see them.   This night we saw what appeared to be a satellite because it was very far away and it was moving at about the same pace as a satellite, but it was very different.  About every 5 seconds it would flash as if it was a huge spot light down on earth.   This flash was extremely large and almost seemed to light up the entire sky.  When it would flash the light appeared to be about a third of the size of the moon when itâ€™s high in the sky.   The Light was white like a flash on a camera.  The flash would burst and then fade out quickly after about a second.   I kept flashing about every 5 seconds until it went out of site behind the trees. I would say we saw it flash about 5-7 times.
