I saw a straight line of about 40 lights in the sky with another light shadowing them.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-24 06:00:00;25 min;I saw a straight line of about 40 lights in the sky with another light shadowing them. I was sitting in my tree stand in the dark, waiting for the sunrise. It was about 6 AM, and I noticed a distinct line of lights in the sky traveling in a straight line. They were all going SW to NE. They were just lights. There was no sound. They just kept coming. There had to be 40 of them. At one point, I could see that they were being shadowed by another, bigger light off to the side, following them on the SE side of the stream. They seemed too high up to be aircraft. At first, I almost thought they were satellites, but they were traveling in a straight line and there were so many of them. I lost track of them as the sun came up.;43.4231;-89.2354
