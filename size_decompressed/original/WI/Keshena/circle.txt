Bright object came from space.;2007-08-12 22:30:00;5 minutes;Bright object came from space. My wife and I were boating back to our cabin after a late night of fishing on Legend Lake, we stopped our boat in the middle of the Lake after seeing a bright round object come from outer space. The object got bigger and brighter as it come from space. The object made several VERY fast moves heading west, then east, north and south with out changing course, just direction, it did impossible moves in the sky. After what seemed to be about a half an hour the object shot straight up into the sky until it dissapeared from our sight. We both looked at each other and said what was that? We both couldn't believe what we witnessed, it couldn't have been anything man made doing what we witnessed. The object traveled impossible distances and directions in seconds.  We have seen objects do some very strange things in the sky from our cabin, mostly during early morning hours. Some objects appear with smaller objects, all different shapes and sizes.;44.9146;-88.6357
