They emitted a beam of light and orbited,about 3/4 size of the moon was their size. The crafts emitted a briliant beam of light. The sky was completely clear. There as only one beam of light though and it seemed to be circleing. The three crafts orbited in a counter-clockwise fasion. They were very large and extreamly fast. Faster than any airplane indeed.It emitted the beam of light a little later on. Before that (this is extrodinary) it seemed to have multiplied like a pearl necklace in an upward fasion every rotation, as if there were sevral rounded crafts comming out of it, then went back in, kinda like a slinky. The color of all of them was a bright white. I seen the shape perfectly, it was a perfect oval type shape.
