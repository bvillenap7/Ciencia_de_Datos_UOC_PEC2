Craft with 3 lights glides over.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-26 23:00:00;10 minutes;Craft with 3 lights glides over. Was outside tending a campfire and looked up and seen what looked like 3 stars very close together in a perfect straight line.  Was shocked to notice them all gliding across the night sky in a perfect line and if you looked closely you could see that they were connected by the rest of the crafted that seemed to be cloaked into the night sky.  All 5 of us all witnessed this and even went completely silent and heard NOTHING!  We watched it just silently glide over passed us and on into the night. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.
