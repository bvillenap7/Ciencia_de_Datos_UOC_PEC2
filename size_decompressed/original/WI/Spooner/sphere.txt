Objects were moving at near mach 1 or only slightly less (I am a pilot) and made no sound, flight path was straight and level to slightly ascending. The intensity of light radiating would easily have been in the multi millions of lumen, and had a purity I have only seen in the prismatic seperation of sunlight. On entering the town of Spooner about 15 minutes later and stopping for fuel,(a local policeman had to get keys and reopen a service station) the few people we spoke to had not seen anything unusual.  In 40 years of flying including three years in combat I have seen nothing remotely similar, the sight was so unusual I remember it now as if it were last week. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
