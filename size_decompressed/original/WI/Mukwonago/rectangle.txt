3 reddish orange lights traveling east over Mukwonago area.;2013-08-31 20:00:00;3-4 minutes;3 reddish orange lights traveling east over Mukwonago area My son and I just happened to look out my patio doors and saw 2 reddish orange lights at about 30 to 35 degrees in the sky moving from east to west over highway ES,   my son ran out yo my truck to get our astronomy binoculars and I stayed on the deck staring at the light one dropped and disappeared and never taking my eyes off the other it slowly dimmed and turned to a black speck then was gone,   suddenly we saw another and he could not focus on it for anything it slowly faded the turned into a brownish black rectangle flew by at a great rate of speed to the west it was about a half mile from us.   We go out every weekend looking for ufos and know the difference between aircraft and stars.  The guy that saw the same thing later that evening is telling the truth this was no joke.;42.8824;-88.3429999999999
