Red and green flashing lights on hovering sphere object.;2014-02-11 21:08:00;5 minutes;Red and green flashing lights on hovering sphere object Flashing red and green lights on a spherical object seen hovering above rooftops, moved left and right in a hovering motion above 3 apartment rooftops for about 4 minutes then hovered up and down quickly for about 1 minute then disapeared below rooftop.   Object made a static high pitch whisteling/humming sound.  Occured at approx. 9:08pm on Tuesday February 11th, in Mukwonago, WI.   Confused on what this object could be, at first sight it looked like a red and green firework that was just launched into the sky right before they blow up and create a large pattern, then it started moving left and right and up and down, object went too high in the sky to be some sort of flying remote controlled toy.   2 witnesses, but others were outside and driving near as well.   Not sure what this object was and would like an answer.;42.8824;-88.3429999999999
