Dear Sir or Ms,   Last Friday, which was June 6th, 2008, I saw an UFO.  This is surprising to me as I usually consider myself a reasonable person.  I am scientifically literate and was completely sober.  I also have 20/20 vision and don’t wear glasses or contact lenses.  It was broad daylight and I was driving in commuter traffic westbound on I43 around 5:24 pm.  I didn’t feel any “creepy feelings” or strange compulsions to make mountains out of mashed potatoes.  This is how it happened:  I saw a helicopter hovering in the air over the town of Mukwonago, Wisconsin.  It looked strange because the helicopter was similar to a traffic helicopter, but had no logos or markings on it.  As this area is quasi-rural, this was out of place and I was curious.  I looked farther into the sky in the direction the helicopter was pointed and saw what looked like the round end of a marshmallow in the sky.  It was white and seemed to have a dimple in the middle of it.  After about two seconds it left, shooting directly out into the atmosphere.  I saw no fire, lights, trails or colors and heard no sounds.  The strange flying marshmallow was just gone.  After it left, the helicopter stopped hovering and flew away in a southwesterly direction.  If you have any questions, feel free to call me at 262-((number deleted)) after 3pm CST.  I don’t know how you could investigate this or what good it would do, which is one reason why I didn’t report it earlier.  Good luck! Sincerely, ((name deleted));42.8824;-88.3429999999999
