Five to Six bright orange colored lights with no sound  seen at 2100 time over Mukwonago, Wisconsin.;2011-06-25 21:00:00;10 Minutes;Five to Six bright orange colored lights with no sound  seen at 2100 time over Mukwonago Wisconsin. Taking dog out for a walk.  Spotted two orange colored lights coming down from the southwest just at sunset.  Sky was with some overcast.   Thought at first it was two small aircraft, but heard no sound. Third object came into view behind the two from same direction.  Looked like they were sky divers slowly coming down and it looked like they were on fire with the bright orange glow.   I called my neighbor out to see what he thought.  I really got excited when two or three more came from the same height and direction. all glowing orange color.   The first three were now slowly going up instead of coming down heading Northwest.  The glowing colors seemed to go out and all we could see was tiny small black objects in the sunset going higher and higher.  Sky Divers don't go up they come down.  All objects seemed to follow the others out of sight towards Eagle Wisconsin.;42.8824;-88.3429999999999
