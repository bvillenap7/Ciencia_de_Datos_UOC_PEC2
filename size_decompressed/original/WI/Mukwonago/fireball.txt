Orange Ball in the West Sky.;2003-10-18 21:30:00;15 minutes;On October 18, 2003 at roughly 9:30 p.m., myself, my fiance and my next door neighbor were having a campfire in my backyard.  Suddenly, my fiance noticed an orange ball in the west sky.  All of us stood up and observed the orange ball come slowly over our heads and slowly fly in the distance.  When I first saw it, I thought it was an asteroid and told everyone to get out of the way because it looked like it was heading right to us.  As it got closer, the orange ball got bigger in size.  I gestimate it was about 10 - 20 times the size of my thumb at arms length.  I estimate it was anywhere from 500 - 2,000 feet off the ground and moving about 200 mph.  It was the same color as fire.  All 3 of us heard no sound whatsoever.  When we first saw the ball it was coming straight from the west.  Once it was over us it seemed to curve slightly to the south.  After it went over us, my fiance asked if she should get the camcorder.  I said by the time she got it, it would be gone.  Then it came to a stop in the distance and I told her to go and get the camcorder.  I set the camcorder on the tripod and recorded the orange ball for about 6 minutes.  The ball hovered in the distance for close to ten minutes.  When it was stationary, the ball of light turned off and on twice.  The first time for about 30 seconds and the second for about 5 seconds.  It was a very clear night.  After a few minutes of watching it stationary, it slowly drifted away while the ball was flickering or illuminating in and out.;42.8824;-88.3429999999999
Fireball flew over our heads on a clear night.;2003-10-18 21:30:00;20 minutes;Fireball flew over our heads on a clear night. My neighbor, my fiance and I were outside having a campfire when out of the corner of my eye I saw something in the sky.  I looked up and saw a fireball.  I said What is that?  Everyone looked and no one knew what it was.  It came from the northwest and was going to the southeast in a perfectly straight line.  It flew over our heads about 1,000 feet up.  It looked like a big ball of fire.  It was the same exact color as fire.  There was no sound and no shadows. At first I thought it was a hot air baloon, but it was going to fast and we couldn't see anything other than the fireball.  My fiance thought it was a meteor or asteroid, but there was no contrail and it was not falling.  When it got behind our trees, my fiance and I got up and walked back to the tree line.  We could still see it in the distance.  It had now changed directions and was going south.  I ran inside and grabbed the camcorder.  After a few minutes, I came back inside and got the tripod.  By now, we were not sure how far away it was.  We just left the camcorder alone and sat by the fire talking about how weird this was.  When we watched what we had recorded, it flickered a little - brighter and dimmer.  Then it would fade away to nothing.  It would reapper in about a minute.  Then do the same thing over agin.  Until it finally just disappeared.  I called our local police department, the county police and two neighboring police departments, but they had no reports about anything in the sky.  My neighbor was talking to another neighbor (with her daughter there also) about what we had saw and the daughter looked at her mom and said see I'm not nuts.  She had seen a fireball about 2 weeks ago outside their living room window.  We can come up with no reasonable explaination as to what it was other than a UFO.  None of us have been able to stop thinking about it and are all always looking up to see if we can see it again.;42.8824;-88.3429999999999

Fireball, slowly traveling east at a low altitude.;2014-08-30 20:20:00;5 minutes;Fireball, slowly traveling east at a low altitude. My son and i were traveling south on hwy 43, 2 miles from the Mukwonago exit, when just to the south of us, and almost directly over us, appeared the most brilliant deep red solid light was traveling east. We pulled over on the freeway in amazement at how close and ever so slowly the object was moving it was approximately 3 or 4 thousand feet high.  It was moving at such a slow pace if it was any slower it would have been stationary, as it moved farther away it blinked 3 time and was gone.   When the object disappeared once again there was a plane that would have been directly in front of it on the course it was traveling.   This was not a plane, a light in a bag, or firework we have seen the identical light 2 month prior my son has a great picture, which we will be sending to Mr. Davenport. Everyone traveling south on the freeway had had to see it.   AMAZING!!!;42.8824;-88.3429999999999
Red object and white craft seen off of Highway 43 in Mukwonago, WI;2014-08-30 20:20:00;5 minutes;Red object and white craft seen off of Highway 43 in Mukwonago, WI It was about 8:20 at night.  It was a clear drive home on highway 43 south. Right before the ramp to Mukwonago a very dark red light appeared mid sky.  It looked the exact same color as other reddish ufo's ive seen in the past.  It was traveling quite fast but it was only about 2,000 FT in the sky.  It just kept coming for about 2-3 minutes without any interruptions!   Then, of course, came the part when the object disappears.  And what is the reason for this? There is usually a quite logical explanation.  The craft does not want to be seen.  As above with this theory, came an airplane coming out of Mitchel Field Milwaukee.  This airplane was coming at the object at a fairly good distance but a general area.  The craft immideatley started flickering in and out and of course like all reports the object disappeared. Was this the end of the night?  No.  Awkwardly, came a bright white light looking like the spotlight of the front of an airplane at night just like it.  It was also in the flight path from the area.  Right when my father pointed this object out and looked at it for about 10 seconds it just sat there it was moving before he told me to look at this thing.  What it took for this object to disappear is nothing but telling me to look.   This happens also quite frequently in looking at these objects.  Once one or more people see it it tends to know and disappear out of thin air.  This all happened in a time frame of about 5 minutes pulled over on Highway 43. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded quite sincere and sober-minded to us.  PD));42.8824;-88.3429999999999
