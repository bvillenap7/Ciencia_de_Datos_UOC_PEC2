Witnessed a strange light in the sky, a dark bright blue that blended with the sky.;2005-02-17 16:30:00;25 seconds;Witnessed a strange light in the sky, a dark bright blue that blended with the sky. I was out side waiting to go for walks with my family, when in the distance i saw a light, at first i thought it was a airplane because they fly in and out of here all the time so its not unusual.  The thing that made me question whether it was an airplane or not is that the craft had no blinking lights, was a very odd dark bright blue color that seemed unatural, it was almost blending in with the sky.   It came from the distance first moving like an airplane, then it moved uncharacteristically of an airplane, it changed directions very fast and erractically.  What happend next made me feel uneasy, it accellerated so fast it went accross the sky and literally disapeared, just shot across the sky faster than any plane i've ever seen.  The whole time i heard not a thing, and whenever something is that close i always hear it, except this time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I was looking in the east From my home in Mukwonago,WI and I would not say it was a craft it could of been but? It was just a very brig;2009-08-03 23:00:00;2 min;I was looking in the east From my home in Mukwonago, WI, and I would not say it was a craft it could of been but?  It was just a very bright white light and it got brighter for about 30 seconds and then in turn it went further directly away from me and then It became a red then a blue color then it completely Disappeared?  I thought it was very strange? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Under ordinary circumstances, we would have contacted the source of the report, in order to inform him/her that the object, almost certainly, was an Iridium satellite, whose highly reflective antenna had caught direct sunlight, and reflected it to the surface of the planet.  The website, www.Heavens-Above.com, is down, at this writing, so I cannot check whether an Iridium flare would have been visible from the location, on the date, and at the time, that the witness indicates.

Line (convoy)? of very bright, deep-orange-red lights flying at low altitude. No sound.;2013-11-28 19:40:00;1 minute;Line (convoy)? of very bright, deep-orange-red lights flying at low altitude. No sound. I went outside to empty trash into my garbage bin at about 7:40 PM and was walking back to my front door when I noticed a VERY bright, deep-orange-red light traveling from north to south about the speed of a small plane at low altitude or a jet at a higher altitude.  It made absolutely no sound.  No prop noise-no jet noise. I’ve never seen aircraft flying at night that had an orange-red light on the front which made me stop and look at it.  I also thought it was very odd in that private planes/commercial jets always have flashing lights on their wings/fuselage and this had none, just an orange-red “headlight”.  I call it a “headlight” because as it passed directly overhead, the orange-red light faded and disappeared.  I’m guessing the light pointed forward which is why I was no longer able to see it once it was traveling away from me. After it disappeared, I looked back from where I first saw it and there was ANOTHER, identical, very bright, orange-red light traveling in the same direction at the same speed-no sound.  I watched it and again, the orange light faded and disappeared once it was directly overhead. After rubber-necking, I looked back again where I had first seen the first two and now there were THREE MORE!  They were all visible at the same time.  They were obviously traveling in a line, following one another.  The first two must have been spaced farther apart and the  last 3 must have been following one another more closely which is why I could see all three of them at once.  I live at the base of a hill with trees on top so I don’t have a good view of the horizon so I could not see all five of them approaching at the same time. The last three did the same thing-fade and disappear once they were directly overhead, one after another.  I could see no wings or profile of the crafts, nor could I hear them.  It was a clear night with stars visible.  No city lights and dead quiet.  I live in the boonies. I’m pretty sure they were very low-maybe 3000-6000 feet.  If they were higher, I would have seen them all at once and they would not have “crept” past the treeline. I’ve seen military planes/copters traveling in convoys before-they make a racket.  These things made no sound at all. After looking at the Mufon posts, I see that others in Wisconsin have seen the exact same red-orange things flying the exact same way.  What the heck are they?  I’m guessing classified military stuff. Anyone else see the same thing on the night of November 28, 2013? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Extremely bright light moving slowly then fading out.;2013-12-11 17:30:00;2 minutes;Extremely bright light moving slowly then fading out I live in the middle of Mukwonago I was on my deck at 5:30 having a smoke and like usual looking to the sky when ONCE AGAIN I saw what looks like a planet or a star as BRIGHT as the brightest spot light there is slowly moving from southwest to northeast for a couple of minutes.  Then it slowly faded out and it was gone I mean gone I believe the passenger plane that was moving to the west just to the east of the light played a role in its disappearance.  This is the 10th time I have seen this type of light..CAN SOMEONE CONFIRM THIS??  PLEASE!!!!;42.8824;-88.3429999999999
White light slowly ascending then slowly fading.;2016-07-25 20:50:00;5 minutes;White light slowly ascending then slowly fading. I was watching the night sky like I always do when I noticed a what I thought at first to be a star in the southern sky but realized that there should not be anything in that position. The brightness of this light was that of Venus it was really bright. After watching this light for about 5 minutes it slowly, slowly started to move I first thought it was moving in my direction but no it was ascending slowly.  It continued to move straight up steadily and after about 30 seconds it started to slowly and I mean slowly fade then it was gone. One of the strange things about this was the fact that almost exactly a year ago I saw a light in almost the identical area but that time the light slowly slowly descended then faded out It was no meteor or plane this time or last there is something happening in that direction all the time. I ask every one to keep looking up there is a lot to see that can not be explained but it can be reported.;42.8824;-88.3429999999999
Bright light that turned deep red.;2016-08-13 20:45:00;5 minutes;Bright light that turned deep red. Once again I step outside on my deck to check the night sky, and directly above me, at an altitude of approximately 20 to 30 thousand feet, is a very bright clear in color moving silently and slowly towards the east.  After 5 minutes of never taking my eyes of the object it slowly started to fade out then it turned the brightest red I have ever seen the was gone. It was a though the object knew it was nearing Mitchel Field Airport in Milwaukee the trajectory it was moving would have put it directly in its path.  I have been watching this same light for the entire month of August and have seen it nightly starting way north of me to now directly over head it seems to be slowing moving south as it ALWAYS IS MOVING EAST.  This accrued at 8:45 pm. Then today looking up to the sky on a partly cloudy morning way up in the sky WAY UP I saw 3 triangular shaped craft flying in a triangle at a great speed heading south no noise, no bird no plane no balloons they most defiantly were UFOs absolutely.   They were at a height of if you held your thumb up out in front of you, it would have coverd them up.  They held a very tight formation, until flying out of my view.  This was at 11:30;42.8824;-88.3429999999999
