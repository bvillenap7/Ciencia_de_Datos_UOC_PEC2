Red light moving slowly over Mukwonago.;2014-06-21 22:20:00;2 minutes;Red light moving slowly over Mukwonago I was walking my dog at 10:15 at night watching the sky as I always do there were a few fireworks going off in the distance when out of no where a bright yellowish red light appeared like a switch was turned on, I thought is was a firework until it started moving slowly to the northeast. I ran back to the apartment to get my son and the astronomy binoculars from viewing it with only my eyesight all you could see was a pulsating red light.  He got the light in focus and all he could say was all my God.   The red light he said was moving back and forth inside of a grey and oval silhouette that was 20 times the size of the red light and what ever side the red light would move so did this huge grey silhouette.  After 30 seconds of the light moving towards us at approximately 2 or 3 thousand feet up it rapidly ascended at a great rate of speed straight up while slowly dimming the it was gone.We have seen allot of lights and unexplained things in the sky but this was the strangest we have EVER seen.  This happened directly over the center of Mukwonago many people had to see this if not the whole town is blind..   WOW!!!!;42.8824;-88.3429999999999
