We were trying to make sense of what they could be as I was driving closer....helicopters etc.  I pulled into a driveway where it was 200 ft away and 200 ft. in the air.   I rolled my window down and could not hear anything and by that time each of the lights dissapeared one by one.  It was in a form of a triangle.   It was a clear night. We went home to report to husband and drove back...saw nothing.  there was no other obstructions or towers in the area.  My son and I had a hard time trying to make sense of it.;42.8824;-88.3429999999999
