Flickering fire like objects in the sky moving fast eventually fade.;2013-05-17 22:30:00;2 minutes;Flickering fire like objects in the sky moving fast eventually fade. Below a high cloud line, two fire like objects almost looking like hot air balloons in the dark, were traveling much more rapidly than a balloon could, and eventually faded before out of sight, almost like they burnt out.  They looked just like a fire in the sky, and even flickered. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.1807000000005;-88.4760000000007
Bright light originating high in the sky and rapidly drops before light disappears.;2019-10-25 00:00:00;22:30;Bright light originating high in the sky and rapidly drops before light disappears. It was very dark, I was driving home to Appleton from the city of Oshkosh.  When I was about halfway home on the highway, near Oshkosh, a bright light about the size of a dime appeared very high in the sky and dropped rapidly before the light faded.  My heart started racing because my mind almost thought it was a far away plane that was crashing, but the light disappeared before it could have hit the ground.  Could not have been a firework as it originated very high in the sky and dropped.  There were also no visible stars on this particular night from where I was in the city.;44.1807000000005;-88.4760000000007
