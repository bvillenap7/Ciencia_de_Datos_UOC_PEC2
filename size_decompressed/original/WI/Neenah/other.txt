multiple ships with a boxcar ship in my neighborhood;1987-07-07 01:00:00;5-10 mins;multiple ships with a boxcar ship in my neighborhood me my mother and sister were awakened one night approx. 7/7/87 by lights from outside the house. when i got down stairs my mom and sis were looking out the windows to the north. we saw at least two ships flying around one looked kinda like the old helicopters from the tv series mash. i have since seen one in a very old painting from the netherlands, i think thats were it was from. but it had the bubble like front and i seen two humanoid occupants. another one flew right over our backyard that was longer and bigger with no bubble type window. then we seen multiple lights flashing coming from the front of the house. we went out on the deck in the back of house. we couldnt see what the lights were coming from, but we could tell it was coming right up the street. so i went around the house to see what it was. i remember my sis telling me to get get back here. i remember seeing a boxcar shaped and size ship coming up the street about 3-4 ft off the ground. and thats the last thing i remember. my mom and sis dont remember any of it. and it wasnt till years later that i remember it. my mom does remember in about 1976 being frozen on the couch watching little figures in blue overalls coming in our apartment and going up stairs were me and my brothers and sisters were sleeping. said she tried to get up and to scream but she couldnt. then in 1980 we lived in madison wi. i woke up one day with my lips chapped raw almost. nothin was unusual the day before. and about a year ago i was awakened to my closet glowing green like some sort of portal. i dont remember anything else but it was defeintly not my clothes in my closet that night.

2 stars moving parallel;2009-08-24 03:45:00;2 minutes;2 stars moving parallel I walk to work every morning at around 3:45AM. It is approximately half a mile walk. I always look up on a clear morning to find a shooting star or plane. I also watch for the ISS when scheduled. On Aug. 24 the ISS was scheduled to appear in the NW at 4:21AM. As I was leaving my house walking north I noticed a group of 3 stars similar to Orion’s belt but this was near the north star in the sky approximately 45 degrees N in the sky. The Orion constellation at this time should be in the lower ESE sky. Because I was walking all the stars appear to be moving but of coarse it is due to my movement. So I stopped walking and noticed 2 of the 3 stars moving east in a parallel formation. As they moved easterly they stayed the same distance from each other (about the same distance from each other as the Orion’s belt) and became dimmer until I could no longer see them approximately 20 degrees NE. Their brightness resembled a medium size star when first noticed. Not as bright as the ISS. When the ISS appeared later in the morning it was lower in the sky (about 20 degrees) and brighter than the stars I had seen earlier but at about the same speed in the same direction. They did not appear to be planes. There wasn’t any flashing lights. Just a steady glow as a medium star. I did see a plane in the sky but it was approximately 80 degrees E in the sky and traveling E in a much slower speed with a red flashing light. I also saw a shooting star later in my walk approximately 70 degrees W in the sky lasting only a second.;44.1807000000005;-88.4760000000007
Yellowish-orange  lighted object in sky travels without sound.;2012-03-16 20:15:00;5 minutes;Yellowish-orange  lighted object in sky travels without sound This is the 2nd time we have seen this. The first time was last yr in August. That time it looked to be spherical in shape like a large yellow light. It had no sound as it traveled over the house. It was coming from the north west traveling south-southeast. Tonight as I went out to bring my lawn chair up to the porch, I saw a bright yellowish light coming from the east. It did not look to be very high up and glowed considerably.  There was no sound to it at all. It looked to be thinner and higher than the previous sighting but still seemed to be the same thing because this time it seemed I was seeing it from the side.  I called my son out to look and  he saw it as it traveled  north-northwest.   What is creepy about this is there is no sound at all. If it were an ultralight there should be sound- it was too large to be a glider and too brightly lit.  It was not a balloon-hot air or otherwise I don't believe.   Any ideas what it might have been?   My son saw it before these 2 times and he said it had traveled from west  going north east and then turned diraction  to go north. There are no flashing lights on it.;44.1807000000005;-88.4760000000007
