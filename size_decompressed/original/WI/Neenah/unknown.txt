Bright orange light  with no sound travels over Neenah sky;2011-07-04 01:56:00;3 minutes;Bright orange light  with no sound travels over Neenah sky As I opened the back door to let my dogs out I noticed a large orange light in the sky headed  towards the house.  It seemed to be very close but had no sound.   I called for my son to come outside and look.  When the porch light came on it changed coarse slightly and headed almost due south.   As it went over us, there was no sound at all.  It traveled southerly  for a short distance and simply disapeared.   There were no flashing lights on the object at all, simply a large orange glowing light.  The size of the light from where we were, was about the size of a grapefruit or larger.   It looked to be about as high up as the helecopter frome the local hospital flies. ((NUFORC Note:  Not the ISS.  PD));44.1807000000005;-88.4760000000007
