No clouds. I was driving through a group of three connected traffic circles which cross over State Highway 41. Heavy lunch time traffic in front of and behind me. I could see the low flying object in my periphery in the upper left corner of me windshield. I glanced at it briefly thinking it was a slow, low flying airplane or helicopter from the near by hospital. I could see it was light colored and TicTac shaped.  It drifted slowly to the right (south). I began trying to keep my eyes on the object while I was driving.  The object appeared to be disguised as a bright cloud in the sunlight however, sparkles of sun reflection (or just very bright light) were glinting through the cloud covering. In about 5 seconds, the time it took to drive half through all three traffic circles,  The object appeared to be shrinking. I quickly realized it was not shrinking, rather it was flying away at an unbelievable rate of speed at a very steep angl! e, maybe 75 degrees. It took the object less than a second to go from hovering over the west shoreline of Lake Winnebago, maybe 250 feet off the ground, to disappearing up into the blue sky with a sound. The object did not appear to pick up or gain speed, speed was instantaneous from start. Again, this occurred on a bright, cloudless winter day in the middle of city lunch hour traffic. I could not have been the only person to have seen this.;44.1807000000005;-88.4760000000007
