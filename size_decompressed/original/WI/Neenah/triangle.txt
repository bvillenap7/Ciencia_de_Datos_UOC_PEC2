Large triangle with pulsing light over Wisconsin;1995-07-01 22:00:00;30 seconds;Large triangle with pulsing light over Wisconsin What I saw was a black triangular craft moving slowly above the treeline.  It made no sound, and did not change direction. The shape of the craft could be seen because of the glow of the lights of the town that were behind it.  I do not know what direction it was travelling, or how far away it was, but it was obvious that it was very large.  I come to this conclusion because the treeline that I compared it too was at least 3 miles away, and the object looked large as it went over the horizon.  As it neared the treeline, there was a ring of white lights that started flashing at the center-rear of the craft.  I don't remember if there was any pattern, as I was very scared at this point, but each pulse lasted less than a second.  I also remember seeing diffuse red lights near where I thought the points of the triangle would be, but I have less of a memory of them.  I was just out of high school at the time, with my girlfriend, visiting her relatives.  I had wanted to be an airline pilot at the time, and when I saw the craft I started listing any large aircraft that I knew of, but none matched what I was seeing.  A few years later when I saw her again, she did confirm that she remembered seeing it, and that my memory was accurate of what I saw.

6 lights flying in perfect large triangle formation. 2 were flashing orange.;2012-09-10 20:30:00;20 seconds;6 lights flying in perfect large triangle formation. 2 were flashing orange. I was standing in my backyard, when I noticed a formation of lights moving in perfect unison in the shape of a triangle.  There were 2 strobe type lights (1 in the front and the other on the right side.  There was a sound but I didn't hear it until the lights were almost out of sight behind the trees.  The sound seemed to travel across the sky at the same speed as the object.;44.1807000000005;-88.4760000000007
