At first I noticed red lights in the sky flying around which would leave a tail behind them.  Some were just sitting there - others were zipping around really fast.  i called to my boyfriend who also witnessed these lights and I went to get my phone so I could record what we were seeing.  Honestly, to me I thought that it was a bunch of drones.  When the red lights disappeared (almost like they faded into the sky) , in the first video, something just zipped across the sky - extremely fast.  The second video is when we saw the orb.  It wasn't close - but it morphed into something like it was spinning and had red and blue lights.;44.1807000000005;-88.4760000000007

Since EAA is starting down here I just blew it off like it was something they were experimenting with.  But as we sat snd watched the more interesting i thought it was snd began recording.  Mind you I have an iPhone 11 so video quality isn’t exactly top notch.  There were 100s if not 1009s of these things!  It was early morning sky just before dawn so it’s still pretty dark out.;44.1807000000005;-88.4760000000007
