I was heading North on Interstate Highway 41 at 7:10p.m. in Neenah Wisconsin (my home) when something caught my eye. At first I thouhgt it was a Jet falling to the Earth or maybe a Missle. It took me by surprise! My best guess is is that it was probably a Meteor. I would approximate the distance at 15 mi. N.W. of Neenah, heading N.W.It was very bright(like a 4th of July sparkler)which I thought was odd considering the Sun was still high in the sky. I would say it was about half B.B. size held at arms length. It left a vapor trail that wasn't very long but it was as wide as an existing vapor trail from a Jet. I thought... something is definately going to strike the Earth.;44.1807000000005;-88.4760000000007
