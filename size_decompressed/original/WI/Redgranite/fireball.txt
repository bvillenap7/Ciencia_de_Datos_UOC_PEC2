While driving approximately 5 east of Redgranite, WI, I witnessed a stationary orange light near the north star.  It was same height in sky as North Star, but it appeared what seemed about 50 feet to the right.  While observing the object for the brief time it was visible, it increased in size and brightness, then disappeared. I was in a rural section, unsure of township. I am a professional driver and drive overnight shift.  This isnâ€™t the first thing I have seen, however it is the first report I have made.;44.0444;-89.0982
