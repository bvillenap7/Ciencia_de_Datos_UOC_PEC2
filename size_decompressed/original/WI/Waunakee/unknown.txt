Bright white light towards Madison.  Slightly higher and left from nearby antenna.;2017-01-28 17:15:00;1 minute;Heading south on 12 from Springfield Corners towards Madison.  Bright white light towards Madison.  Slightly higher and left from nearby radio antenna. Similar to a star but 10x brighter and slightly larger.  Hovered still until streaking fast to the right and dissapearing.  I was watching and expecting the object to turn and see red and green lights being near the airport, however the only light was a very bright whitish/blue.  The object also dissapeared far faster than any jet could.;43.1790999999998;-89.4569000000003
