As I was watching this I was rubbing my eyes to be sure that I was awake.  (In fact I stayed up most of the night after the sighting) I was in an artillery unit in the Marine Corps during the Vietnam era and spent some time training at the Army base at Fort Sill OK where they fire some of the larger rockets and artillery. This object was going from the East to the West toward the Town of Middleton.  I estimate it was between 3500 and 6000 feet above my home.  It seemed that the trajectory would be coming down in  T of Middleton.  I was thinking at the time that the thing would do great damage to about 1/4 square mile.without a warhead-it was that big. What was really strange was the color-It was the green that comes close to the glowing color of radioactive materials seen in movies.  It looked like a large glowing  Pepsi type can only it was the size of a house.(no sound)  The rear end of it had  something like a twisted tail of what looked like smoke mixed with the green. I watched it until it went where I could not see from inside the house. When I went outside to follow it it was gone.  I live in the country on a farm.
