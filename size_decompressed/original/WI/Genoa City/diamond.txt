Large diamond-shaped aircraft with multi-colored lighting.;2015-08-27 01:15:00;2-3 minutes;Large diamond-shaped aircraft with multi-colored lighting. It was a clear starry night and we were just arriving home, when before we went inside, a ball of lights in the north distance caught my eye.  We continued to watch it as it was moving very quickly towards us and at that time I knew this wasn't any regular airplane.  It looked like a mass of a ball of lights from the distance, as it got closer we saw lots of lights and they were purple, blue, green, and pink.  I never saw a plane with those color lights.  Now it was coming overhead still high up in the air and we could see it was a very very large diamond shape from underneath and made no sound whatsoever.  It traveled quickly south over the WI/IL border.  We could not get a picture with my iPhone, as it doesn't work in the dark.;42.5323;-88.3485000000001
