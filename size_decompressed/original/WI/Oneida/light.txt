My roommate and I noticed the fingernail moon was out, so i got out my telescope.  As we observed the moon, my roommate pointed out a light in the sky coming from the northwest.  at first we thought it might be an airplane, but it was just one solid white light, no flashing lights whatsoever.  there was no sound coming from it either.  as it passed overhead we thought we might start to hear the sounds of a small airplane, but still we didn't hear anything.  As it flew overhead we noticed it was making small, instantaneous slips to it's left and right.  It passed over us at a relatively low speed, headed to the southeast.  Right around the time we figured it would have been over Austin-Straubel Airport, the light slowly began to dim and changed from white to a orange that got darker as it dimmed.  Within seconds it was gone altogether.  We have never seen anything like this before, hopefully somebody can read this an shed some light on our sighting.  What! ever it was, it has us pretty excited :D;44.5167;-88.1835
