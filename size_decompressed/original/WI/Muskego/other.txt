Outer perimeter of ring was about the size of the moon as you see it on a clear night.  You could liken the rings visual appearance as ghostly. (After calling the other witness outside to take a look, went back in the house so cannot say for how long the occurrence lasted.) The hazy appearance could have been because of the heavy cloud cover.  (Very close to the top of the house, like the same distance a plane has come close to the house during low ceiling due to cloud cover.);42.906;-88.1232
