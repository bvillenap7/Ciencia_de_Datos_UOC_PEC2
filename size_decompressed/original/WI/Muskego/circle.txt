I went outside to sneak upon her.  As I was approaching her I looked up to the North and saw two airplanes, one flying South and banking East to make an approach to Mitchell airfield.  The other was much higher and heading North West leaving behind it a vapor trail.  Immediately upon fixing my eyes on those airplanes I saw a small circle shaped grayish colored object streak across the sky in a Westerly direction.  I tried to get my wife to see it but she looked toward the direction of the airplanes and discounted what I had to say.  With my eyes fixed on this new object I walked around the back of the cars to get a better look.  This object was flying in a straight line, and the only noise I heard was from the first airplane which was on approach.  The UFO was smaller than either airplane and was traveling quite fast.  Also, it was not leaving a vapor trail.  As this object was flying away to a point West of my location it suddenly started to turn, but I didn't notice a banking movement as with the airplane.  It started making complete counter clockwise circles along the same altitude it was flying, and I made a mental note of how small the flight radius was for such a fast speed.  Well, within a few seconds there appeared a second object, and then a third and a forth.  They were all flying in counter clockwise circles stacked over the same airspace separated by altitude.  The objects were going in and out of view as if they were reflecting off of the sun and then not and then reflecting again.  I estimate watching this for about five minutes when my eyes became strained from the sunlight and I desperately wanted to go get the video camera.  So I went inside and got the camera but when I went back outside I could not find the objects anymore.  There were no news reports of any unusual flying objects.  The weather was sunny, unlimited visibility, 59 degrees F, dew point was 43 degrees F, with a few upper level clouds in the di! stance.;42.906;-88.1232

One single ball of light far away in the sky appeared out of no where, flew straight up, then changed direction quickly and darted out of the sky, disappearing.   I could compare the speed to an airplane that was also flying nearby and the object was well over double the speed of the plane.   Upon appearing, it grew increasingly brighter until finally changing direction.   It left no trail or sound.;42.906;-88.1232

Prior to this about 5 minutes before there were two or three bats going crazy.;42.906;-88.1232
