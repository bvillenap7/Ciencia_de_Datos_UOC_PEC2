Five bright red lights up in the sky in a formation.  One by one they faded away, and they flew much faster than any plane I've ever seen.   It was not any type of aircraft I've ever seen.  They were too low to be a satellite and too bright to be any type of plane.   There is no other explanation to these lights. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect an evening sighting, and have changed the time above to reflect that possibility.  PD));42.906;-88.1232
