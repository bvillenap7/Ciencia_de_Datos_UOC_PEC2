We went outside to see what all the comotion was and while we were standing in the back yard 7 oval shaped craft approached from the east. They were in a V formation. Another 7 approached from the west. They were each moving at a very fast pace.They then began chasing eachother through the air until it seemed as if a swarm of fire flys had descened from the heavans. We were so impressed by the occurance that we watched until they all finally took off to the south.;42.906;-88.1232
