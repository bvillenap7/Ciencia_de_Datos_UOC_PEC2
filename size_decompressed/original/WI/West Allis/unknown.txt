Strangest Encounter Yet!;2012-07-16 22:00:00;2 minutes;Strangest Encounter Yet! Heard strange noises emanating from a cell West on Lincoln.  At first a loud sound caught my attention, amplified, flared, fizzled, made what sounded almost like a voice, sputtered and faded out leaving no trace or trail though it sounded like loud crackling and I expected to see something, but nothing there.   The object (sound) was going North to Southeast and was gone and disappeared with a loud click.   It ended as quickly as it started without any residue!   Strangest thing I ever heard!   At first thought it might be heat lightning or an atmospheric electrical discharge in the atmosphere and it ended almost a suddenly as it started.   There was an odor in the air, very strong like smoke hanging several minutes after the experience ended, almost like something was burning!
