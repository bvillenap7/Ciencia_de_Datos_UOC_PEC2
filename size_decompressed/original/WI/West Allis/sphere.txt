We went outside to watch the neighborhood fireworks.  I observed 2 red orbs over the neighborhood directly south from us.  I pointed them out to my wife and son.  We had originally assumed they we drones but never saw them go up or down.  After hearing the report of 2 red orbs over Beloit, WI, (about 60mi SW from me) I'm starting to believe we witnessed the same 2 orbs.;43.0184;-88.0157
