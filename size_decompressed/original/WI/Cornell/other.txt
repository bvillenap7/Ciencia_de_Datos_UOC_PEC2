This was a very quick encounter of seeing what appeared to be like the shape of a winged aircraft moving at a unbelievable speed.  At 18:04 to 18:10 hours I was in my parents back yard with my mother and my brother.  All of a sudden my brother shouts look and points to the southern sky.  This time of year it is pure daylight. He is shouting LOOK LOOK!  Finally I see what appears to be an aircraft. If I had to say what it actually appeared like I would say it reminded me of a Lear jet shape. It left no vapor trails like jets typically leave. To judge its speed I will use what a person typically sees from a jet trail. This craft went 10 to15 times as fast in a Northern direction and then suddenly turned to the East and disappeared. The sky was without clouds.  If I had to judge altitude I would say it was near the same altitudes that jet liners fly.  The craft shimmered from the sunlight but looked the same as what an airliner would look like.  At the time of the si! ghting it was hard to envision the actual speed of the craft.  After the encounter I thought about the amount of sky that this craft covered ...  The speed can only be gauged from a reference of the normal trails of jetliners.  This craft covered in five seconds time what you would see an aircraft cover in 30 to 50 seconds.  It was only after the encounter did I realize what I saw! A lso there were no other aircraft vapor trails in the sky this evening.;45.1619;-91.1733
