Was traveling east on Hwy. 29 between Shawano and Bonduel. Noticed a object along side my truck at a distance. It first apeared like a large plane with a row of windows. I thought it was a plane atempting to land on the highway. As it grew closer i realized the object was to large to be a plane. In addition it had no flashing lights or landing lights. It was very long in length, possibly 200' to 500' feet. It had a row of what apeared to be windows yellow orange in color, with several lights in the front and rear the same color. It seamed to slow as it got closer to my truck, almost directly in front, about 1/4 mile away. It dipped down behind some trees, and dissapeared. My son as well as myself witnessed this object. When i came around the trees i looked to see if this oject had landed. There was nothing I could see. It was night and I did not wish to get out and look around. We heard later that there were several other people in the area who seen this. I am an engineer in a manufacturing plant, and my son is three years of age.;44.7842000000001;-88.6033000000002
