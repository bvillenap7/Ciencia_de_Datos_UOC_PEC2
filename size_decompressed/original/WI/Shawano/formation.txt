5-7 balls of orange light in formation.;2013-05-18 23:30:00;5-10 minutes;5-7 balls of orange light in formation. My husband and I were visiting my brother in Shawano, Wisconsin on the weekend of 5/17 to 5/19/2013.   My husband went outside to have a cigarette and yelled for me to come outside and look at what was in the night sky.   There were up to 7 balls of orange light in perfect formation and they would move up and from side to side.  This was something I had never seen before!  There was no sound accompanied with the objects of light.  Pretty amazing stuff to see!;44.7842000000001;-88.6033000000002
