7 sided bright object, zero sound, straight flight path;2020-09-19 20:07:00;3 minutes;7 sided bright object, zero sound, straight flight path Avid star gazer.  Was using NVGs to show my Mother-in-Law The Andromeda Galaxy, both with the naked eye and with NVG. We watched the international space station fly over along with some space junk rocket boosters.  My Mother-in-Law was in control of the NVGs(PVS-7 Auto gate) at the time of the sighting.  She asked me what an object was coming across our sky from West to North East and while looking through the NVGs she pointed to a spot in the sky where I saw something moving a bit faster than a satellite,  was a lot brighter than a satellite and instinct told me it was in the Earths atmosphere based on size.  This was a very clear night with the Milkyway in view.  The naked eye easily picked this object up.  It seemed just a bit faster than commercial aircraft passing so I decided to start to video it after it passed overhead and counted to about 31 seconds expecting to hear the jet engines like every other commercial jet which passes, yet I waited and waited and even mentioned in the video it was far enough away that we should have been hearing it, but there was silence.  I took the NVGs because my Mother In Law kept saying there were 2 objects one black and the other the bright ball of light. So I too wanted to witness what she was able to see with the more advanced technology.  I peered through the NVGs and the object flared them as much as a ground based street light would and it was still far away by then.  Afterwards I was able to take still zooms of my video and this appears to be 7 sided and 3 dimensional with some sort of opening on 1 side and based on the stills it appears that it was rotating yet my eyes, camera and NVGs don't pick that up.;43.3214;-87.9495
