Weird orange lights moving into formation, then disappearing;2012-08-18 21:30:00;10 minutes;Weird orange lights moving into formation, then disappearing August 18, 2012  We were driving north northeast on Green Bay Road in Grafton WI about 9:30 p.m.  We observed several widely-spaced, nonblinking orange balls moving in a line from eastern horizon to the west.  Each came to the same point, then moved into position upward, left or right, until they were in triangle formation.   At this point we pulled off into a parking lot to watch, where several other people were taking pictures and videos.  The triangle formation rotated northward  and began to slowly ascend as several more balls moved toward the formation, disappearing as it reached its center.  After 10 – 15 orbs were  “absorbed,” and no others appeared over the horizon, we decided to move further north to an area with less ground light to better observe the phenomenon.  Upon securing a new position, we were unable to observe the orbs again.  I am almost fifty, am familiar with experimental aircraft, and have never seen anything move in the sky in this manner, so steady, unblinking, and fa! st, way too high to be anything hovering like that.  I took some pictures, but they don't give the phenomenon justice.;43.3214;-87.9495
