Several hundred orange/reddish orbs SE to NW on 7-1-10 at 10PM CST over Mequon, Grafton, Cedarburg, WI;2010-07-01 22:00:00;30 minutes;Several hundred orange/reddish orbs SE to NW on 7-1-10 at 10PM CST over Mequon, Grafton, Cedarburg, WI Our family of four were coming home from a baseball game in Thiensville just, a few miles west of Mequon and grafton, WI.  It was just about 10 PM and the sky was very clear.   At Port Washington Rd and and Pioneer Rd we looked east and we saw many floating or hovering orbs maybe 100 or so in in the east sky in a long line of succession heading from the lowest part of the horizon in the south east graduating higher and higher in the sky to the northwest.  We pulled over on Pioneer Rd East of  I43 and saw several other cars who were also stopped to witness this very unusual site.  We all watched and shsrugged to each other as if to say we didn't know what we were seeing.  We watched for about 5 minutes then continued east on Pioneer Rd 1/2 mile towards Lake Michigan to our home and parked in our driveway to watch the light show overhead.   As we turned off the engine and opened the sunroof the lights continued to rise from SE to NW with absolutely no noise.  They see! med to rise higher and higher into the sky above Cedarburg or north of that. I suggested that that they needed the shoreline to navigate south to north.   I do have a short video on my blackberry phone showing the glowing reddish lights.   We discussed what they could b:e maybe hot air balloons but it was way too many and way too silent.  They kept coming for 20-30 minutes and finally disappeared into the night.   I have a short video on my cell phone showing the orbs heading up in the NE sky.  We watched the paper and the news for a report of this sighting and there was absolutely nothing  written or reported on TV.;43.3214;-87.9495
