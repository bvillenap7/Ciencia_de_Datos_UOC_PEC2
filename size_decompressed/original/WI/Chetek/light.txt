Star size blinking/fast moving white lights- about a dozen;2012-12-08 06:00:00;15 minutes;star size blinking/fast moving white lights- about a dozen I took my dog out this morning about 6 am. It had snowed out a little during the night and I decided to shovel and sweep. The sky was so clear and I could hear the lake making ice. I looked up at the sky hoping to see a satalite and i did. but while I was looking up I thouhgt i kept seeing blinking lights here and there.  I thought it was just my eyes. I finally spotted a flashing light that I could follow and I began to see many.  The traveling/ blinking lights were about the size of a smaller star and I'm not sure how high up they were--maybe out of our atmosphere.The blinks looked like a camera flash. They traveled in  irradic patterns and flashed every now and then.  I had to go inside. came back out about 15 minutes later and tried to spot them again but no luck.  It was starting to get a little lighter outside but could still see the brighter stars. I was standing facing west but I saw them almost straight above me and a little to the south, west and north. Not sure what I saw but when the sky clears again I will be looking.  Wondering if anyone else in the area had seen these.;45.3185;-91.6491
