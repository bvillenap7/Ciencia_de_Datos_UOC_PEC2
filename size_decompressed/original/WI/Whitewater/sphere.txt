It was 1974, and I was on a date where common 20 something necking was occurring.  Then there were metallic machine like noises.  Then a bright white light rose from a nearby farm field, probably a good 400 yards away.  It rose rapidly in the sky.  It went among a large grouping of lights, which I later learned were commercial airliners waiting in line for O'Hare airport.  The thing is it came to mimic the lights shifting to a similar orange light.  It sped through or near the formation at an incredible speed, even faster than satellites I have seen previous to that.  It simply was gone, as I turned to point it out to the woman I was with.  It must have given some pilots a fright.  Though a local sheriff spokesperson told me I was mistaken and that it was an airliner.  I was spooked and we went right back to my dorm and the date was over.;42.8254;-88.7335999999999
