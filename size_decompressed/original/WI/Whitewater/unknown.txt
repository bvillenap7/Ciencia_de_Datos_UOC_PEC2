Multiple lights in the sky moving somewhat together, hovering, then dissipated,  silent, just after dusk.;2014-10-08 19:30:00;~10 minutes;Multiple lights in the sky moving somewhat together, hovering, then dissipated,  silent, just after dusk. My daughter and I were returning from music lessons when I thought that I saw airplanes circling out from MKE or Chicago (my dad was in aviation) as I continued to look I realized they were absolutely not moving as airplanes do, and that there were far too many, far too close together, and did not appear to move in the way of a conventional aircraft. I study them for as long as I could, and then decided I had to stop trying to figure out what they were because I was driving and having to divert my attention to the right of my vehicle and off the road to watch. I considered pulling over, but then justified to myself, that these must be some sort of collections of lanterns or something  being lit and let go into the air by the college or something (though realistically I think they were to high for that). I honestly have no idea what I saw, they were slow moving little balls of light, almost hovering and had a glow that did not appear to really match conventional aircraft wing,nose,tail lighting, just a single glow which seemed to hover and move slowly in a type of formation, but ever so slightly in varied directions (again why I thought perhaps lanterns of some sort. For the first time in my life I did have a bit of fear about it, but again having a father that did flight test, I quickly began to rationalize what I saw. I have been trying to figure it out now by looking online for some celebration that may have occurred or something, but I truly have no concrete answer. They eventually just sort of dissipated (again why I thought perhaps lanterns) yet justifiably they were really high and it was just the oddest feeling...I just don't know (seen while driving towards Whitewater on  HWY 59 about a few miles outside of town watched until I was almost to the first set of buildings)  Any explanation, or thoughts are appreciated.;42.8254;-88.7335999999999
