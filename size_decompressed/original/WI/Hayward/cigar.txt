Extremely fast, long, straight obj. with 20-30 lights..no sound. Blocked out stars behind it.((NUFORC Note:  SpaceLink satellites. PD));2019-05-26 22:30:00;2 minutes;Extremely fast, long, straight object with 20-30 lights.. no sound. Blocked out stars behind it and was followed by 2 smaller craft. One super long, straight object with about 20-30 star like lights and one super bright blue light in the center.  It blocked out the stars behind it as it passed by, I’d say it was 5-10 miles long and moving extremely fast.  It looked like stars on a treadmill with a big blue light in the center.  It made no sound what so ever and as soon as it passed 2 more little sporadic lights followed seemed to be bouncing from side to side as they followed behind..  About 5 min later 3 jets went by and these were not jets, the actual jets also moved extremely slow compared to the 3 other craft and I could also hear the jets, although the ufo’s looked to be way higher in altitude.  Too dark to get any photos or vids. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect SpaceLink satellites.  Please see other reports.  PD));45.9571380341879;-91.2759713675214
