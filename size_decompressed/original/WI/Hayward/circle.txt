About 10:00 pm tonight I was sitting on my living room chair talking on phone when I saw a bright light out the picture window coming from southern sky, at first thought it was a helicopter but it was too bright so I ran outside into yard and it flew, a little faster than a plane would have, directly over our house right in the city of Hayward and as it passed over I saw that it was a circular object with a bright orange-red glow at the center with very dim lights going out to a circle and there was no sound whatsoever.    I called my wife out and she also saw it as it was already passed our house but we both watched cruise North until it was out of view.  It probably lasted nearly a minute for the whole sighting. We’ve had rain tonight and I checked the weather and the clouds are at 3,700 feet so it was somewhere below that level but at least 2,000 feet I would guess.  There was no sound whatsoever so I know it wasn’t a plane or helicopter.   I called local police to see if they had any reports, he mentioned meteor showers tonight but there was no way that was a meteor, moved way to steady in flight in straight line and height and too slow across sky and below the clouds. First time I’ve ever seen something like this and it was most incredible!  I am the editor of a local newspaper so i'll most definately be sharing this experience with my readers.;45.9571380341879;-91.2759713675214
