Very bright light over northern Wisconsin.;2009-09-10 21:37:00;3 min;Very bright light over northern Wisconsin My cousin's and i were outside working on a three wheeler. My youngest cousin noticed something in the sky and pointed it out to us. I looked up at what appeared to be a really bright white light. I thought it was a satellite at first, but noticed it was way to big to be a satellite. The object was approximately three or four time's bigger than the brightest star i could see in the sky and was traveling at a very high rate of speed. Almost like a shooting star.  The bright light slowed way down and almost came to a stand still. It didn't completely stop but it didn't move very fast either. By this time we were for yelling for my friend to come outside and witness what we were seeing. He came outside looked at it and couldn't figure out what it was either. He said the same thing i did, that it was to big to be a satellite. It stayed at this slow speed for about thirty to fourty seconds before it changed direction and took of at an even faster rate of speed fr! om when we first saw it.  The object vanished from our field of view behind of the tree line.  My younger cousin told me that he's seen three of these same bright light's the past week.  I've only witnessed this one sighting.  I've also checked the heaven's above website just in case it was the ISS. The ISS was nowhere near anybody of land. Even if it was, i don't think it could have maneuvered the same way this object did. The ISS Was also moving in the opposite direction.;45.9571380341879;-91.2759713675214
