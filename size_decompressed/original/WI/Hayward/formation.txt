Amber Lights in Northern Wisconsin;2010-06-16 20:15:00;2 min;Amber Lights in Northern Wisconsin Was up in Hayward, WI on a fishing trip. We decided to do some night fishing this night.  The lake was Chippewa Flowage, it is a lake in northern Wisconsin, pretty secluded and surrounded by forest. We had are boat anchored right by an island, and we were looking east.  Right above the tree line I seen two bright amber yellow objects and by the time I asked the guy in the boat if he was seeing this, there was 5 and then we watched the 6th one rise straight up from behind the tree line.  It seemed like the other 5 were waiting on the sixth light.  Once they were all there they formed more like a check mark formation.  They moved north for about 30 seconds. I lost 3 of the lights behind the trees on he island but I still seen three and they were headed east now, and fast. Just as fast as they came in our field of view they were gone. I know they weren't planes, I live in Chicago and right by one of the busiest airports in the world.  I am used to seeing hundreds of ! planes everyday.  Plus, I know it wasn't military.  I was in the Air Force for many years and I never seen a formation like that, and plus the distance between the objects was two far for military.  I checked maps of the area and there isn't a airport in site that could handle such aircraft.  The lack of noise and the way they moved ruled out choppers.  So I am puzzled, but it was definetly something I can not explain.;45.9571380341879;-91.2759713675214
