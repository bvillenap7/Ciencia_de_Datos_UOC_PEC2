No sound or marker lights. 8/28/2013  I took my dog out side so she could go, and i was facing southeast when i noticed a bright light out of the corner of my right eye and looked up to see what it was.  i thought it was an aircraft but it wasn't, it was rectangular shape and a very bright florescent white light and it was moving slow and there was no sound and no other lights on it. i watch it for about 5 minutes as it past going northeast,i watched it until it disappeared in the clouds to the northeast. i have never seen anything like that before or since. i also have had three other sightings of orbs. one being chased by a military jet that flew right over my house twice.;44.0397;-88.7523
