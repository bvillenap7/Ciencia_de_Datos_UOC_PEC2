Lights in a horizontal line in south sky east of Omro, WI.;2013-11-12 21:58:00;20 seconds;Lights in a horizontal line in south sky east of Omro, WI. It happened really fast.  I was watching SOA on TV with a friend.  The TV is right next to a sliding door facing south.  I saw a light turn on then another and another till there was 9 lights on in a horizontal line.  And then the first light that turned on shut off and the rest followed till there was no light. I went out to see if I could make anything out but couldn't see anything.  It was low but above the trees.  The only thing that was different was that I could feel something.  As if a semi was driving by but no sound.  Just a low vibration of bass or something that I couldn't hear. We've seen lights moving in odd patterns out here before and I just figured it had to do with the airports in the area.  It is also common to see skydivers and odd looking planes as the Experimental Aircraft Association is not that far away.  But the time we see these lights are usually late into the night. If anyone saw or could explain this one, I'd like to hear it as I am the only one that saw it tonight.;44.0397;-88.7523
