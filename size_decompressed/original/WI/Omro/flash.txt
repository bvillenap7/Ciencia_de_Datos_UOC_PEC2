Multi-colored group of flashing lights zig-zagged across sky.;2013-10-09 20:20:00;45 minutes;Multi-colored group of flashing lights zig-zagged across sky I watched flashing lights moving up and down and zig-zagging across sky for about 45 minutes.  I saw a concentrated area of multi-colored flashing lights that would dim and appear brighter at times.   Eventually the group of lights diminished in size and disappeared in just a few seconds.;44.0397;-88.7523
