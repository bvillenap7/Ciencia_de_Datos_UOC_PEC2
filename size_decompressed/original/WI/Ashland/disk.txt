It was freaky sleeping afterwards. **NOTE: We didn't see all six UFOs at once.**  At about 10:45, I sent my younger cousin downstairs to ask his mother if we could go outside to watch for UFOs. We've seen them before while looking up into the night sky, so why not look again? Anyway, she said no at first. So we just sat on the bed, then the twins were acting up and the mother was angry. She was trying to get them to bed, since they were only six years old. I finally talked her into letting us go outside. So we sat on the chairs outside at about 11:00 PM. We sat there looking up for a while. We were talking about dreams about aliens and UFOs and the such. About the Roswell incident, about the government and them making deals with aliens. Suddenly, my older cousin sees a white, round light moving in the sky. I would've thought it was just a plane or something like that, but it wasn't making any noise. Nor was it blinking. We just sat there looking at it move across the sky. Then all of a sudden, it disappeared! We didn't see anything after that, so we went over to another spot. Then, one of the freakiest things happened We saw 5 of the same lights moving. They were a bit dull, but were still visible. They were moving, shifting directions, passing each other up... real freaky stuff. Then, it gets freakier, they all disappear. Not all at the same time, but they do. We can't see anything after that, so we sit down and talk about aliens and UFOs and stuff. And then my older cousin said something that freaked the hell out of me: People who see UFOs have a much bigger chance of getting abducted than someone who haven't seen one.;46.5614666666668;-90.751358333333
