Around 3:30 am cst I had just logged of the internet. Went to the bathroom and got a snack. I had heard little noisies alnight but didn't give it much thought. Then I fed my cat got my nightgown on and then went to bed. Turned the TV on cause I was still wide awake. Got just about all nestled in when I big flash of light came throught the window and weird noisies began and the whole house shook. My cat started acting very weird, this is not normal for him he's very old and I never saw him act like that before. The lights kept turning on and off the TV kept turning on and off also. It would get very dark and then bright flashing lights would appear. I couldnot move. It was like I was frozen. Finally it went away. I called my son on the phone to tell him what happened. He works at the alnight conveinant store. He saw nothing. The store is about one mile away. I'm still shaking. I cannot get it out of my mind. I was not dreaming this I swear to GOD it really happened. Then when I looked at the clock it was 4:10. This all took place in 10 minutes.;46.5614666666668;-90.751358333333
