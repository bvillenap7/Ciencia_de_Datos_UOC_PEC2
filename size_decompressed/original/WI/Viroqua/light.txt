Perfectly straight line left behind by a light traveling through the sky.;1993-10-27 02:40:00;2 minutes;Perfectly straight line left behind by a light traveling through the sky. We were driving home at approximately 2:40am when we saw a light traveling from north to south. It crossed the entire sky in a matter of minutes.  After the light was gone a single thin laser like trail remained in the sky for another minute or so.  This line was perfectly straight and stable.  You could actually see it curve away with the radius of the atmosphere.  There was no burning or anything, not like anything any of us have seen before. There were four of us in the car, we also called two of our friends and they confirmed that they saw the same phenomenon.  Also keep in mind that all of us have seen a satellite before, and this object was traveling several times faster than that.;43.5468;-90.8958
