Red, orange and blue lights in a field forming a triangle.;2014-08-03 00:15:00;5 minutes;Red,orange and blue lights in a field forming a triangle My boyfriend and I were on our way home from Wisconsin Dells on Hwy A, headed towards 151.  It was about 12:15-12:20 am.   We could see a red light in the distance and had originally thought that it was from a tower. When we came closer we could actually see that this light was in the middle of an open field and that there were two other lights along with it that were orange and blue in color. 		       The shape of the lights formed an isosceles triangle, with the red light being on the top (pulsating), then the orange and the blue being at the bottom, closest to the ground.   The object was huge and would have been bigger than a house or barn if it was placed next to one.   None of the lights were moving and it remained stationary as we drove past.  We could not hear any noises coming from it either.  We could not see anything that connected the lights together it just seemed like they were free floating by themselves making up this pattern.  Another car coming in the opposite direction seen the same thing, and they pulled over to try and figure out what it was as well.  We did not stop since this object gave me a very uneasy feeling.   We have never seen anything like this and it was so close to the highway (about 100 feet away or so) that if it was a plane or anything we would have been able to tell.  It was almost like whatever was attached to the lights was invisible, and only the lights were able to be seen.   We have not been able to explain this (logically) as to what this could be.;43.6369;-88.7385
