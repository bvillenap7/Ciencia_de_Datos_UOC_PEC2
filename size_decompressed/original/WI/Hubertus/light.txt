After gazing at it for a moment or two (it was stationary), it began to move quickly in a north-easterly direction I stood on my deck and watched as it move directly overhead and then out of my line of sight (over my rooftop)  It very large, the size of a planet.  I thought I'd seen the ISS perhaps catching the pre-dawn sun to the east.  I've since checked the location of the ISS on that date and time in the ISS visibility chart for my area - it was not listed as visible for my area at that time. It was not a regular communication satellite (even one visible with Iridium flare as I have seen this often) as this was 100 times larger again, it appeared to be planet-sized to my observation. I am a 55-year old woman with a BS degree and a three-year graduate degree.  I am employed full-time and of sound mind.  I frequently look to the skies as many people do and I am not known for over-reacting or making any odd claims.  This is the first report I have ever completed, though not my first strange experience when observing the sky.;43.2343;-88.2311
