Fire balls turned into black spheres.;2014-08-05 20:46:00;4 minutes;Fire balls turned into black spheres. Was walking out of a local walmart.  Noticed a person looking up in the sky.  I observed two orange fire balls raise off the ground straight into the air, to the south of my location.   Once fire balls reached 2000-3000 ft off the ground they quickly burned out.   I ran to my car and grabbed my night sky binoculars.  Once I focused on the two objects I noticed two very black cylinders floating to the west direction.  It may sound dtrange but I have never seen anything so deep in the color black before.  Almost metallic blackish.   They slowly floated out of my view leaving me puzzeled as to what they were.  Much too small to be a plane but too big for a balloon.  Both very solid objects.;42.9569999999994;-87.9898000000011
