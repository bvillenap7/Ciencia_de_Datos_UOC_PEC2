Strange bronze/copper object slowing flying in the sky, changing shapes, disappears instantly.;2015-07-02 11:00:00;few minutes;Strange bronze/copper object slowing flying in the sky, changing shapes, disappears instantly. While I'm on my way to work, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, as I sat at the traffic light waiting for it to change.  I looked my right, west, there was something relatively low in the sky that I initially thought was a balloon.  It was hovering over and near a strip mall.  But as I'm watching it, it changed shape as it flew rather slowly.  Its color seemed to be copper.  I couldn't really tell how far away it was or how big it was or how far away it was.  As I'm watching it- it vanishes!  It just disappears in an instant.  I don't know how long it was in the sky as I rolled up to the stop light, but I only caught 2 minutes of it.  I also want to mention, I've been experiencing truly paranormal (?) events with UFOs since about 2011 and on a fairly regular basis.  I live in Wisconsin suburbs, so it's not like I'm out in the middle of nowhere.;42.9569999999994;-87.9898000000011
