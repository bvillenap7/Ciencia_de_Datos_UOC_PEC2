Saw a disk in the sky moving slowly going from east to west.  Way too low for an airplane, maybe about 400-500 feet off the ground.  Unusual look to it because it was so bright at times, assuming it was sunlight reflecting off of it but maybe it was its own light as well.  Object stopped and got a better look at it.  It was silver, disk-shaped, wouldn't say it was a large object but a good enough size.  It sat there for about 20 seconds then it began to move southwest, starting slowly then picking up speed, going so fast that it was just a dot in about 20ish seconds. The whole thing lasted about 2 minutes, maybe close to three.  First time experiencing something like this, never thought it would be this casual in the day time.
