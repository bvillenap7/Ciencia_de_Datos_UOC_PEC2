As I a;1999-07-15 04:15:00;2-3 minutes;I was going S/B on Hwy 75 on my cycle when I saw a dull orange glow at approx. 30 degrees up directly ahead of me over the road. As I approached this glow it suddenly extinguished, but this occurred with the top and rightside and then the leftside being turned off one after the other. I now knew this was some type of craft and I could still see the black shape in the clear/bright night sky. I slowed my cycle and pulled almost directly under the object, which was still hovering but making no sound that I could hear over my cycle's noise.  As I stopped beneath I would est. it to be the size of a hockey puck at arms length.  Now the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I got goose bumps and a chill all over my body.  I then decided descretion is the better part of valor and took off.  I went about a half mile and stopped but could no longer find the object in the sky. Description: About the size of a hockey puck at arms length, disk shaped with a flat bottom and some type of dome in the center top which tapered towards the outer edge.  As I got more underneath I could only see the black circular shape with no lights or any distinctive features seen.  This craft hovered the entire time and I observed no movement and could hear no sound coming from it.
