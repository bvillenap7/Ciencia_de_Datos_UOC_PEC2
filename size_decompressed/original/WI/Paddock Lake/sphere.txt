Silvery sphere, glowing white, headed southwest very quickly from Paddock Lake, Wisconsin;2003-11-11 20:50:00;2 seconds;Silvery sphere, glowing white, headed southwest very quickly from Paddock Lake, Wisconsin While driving on a dark side street headed south-west and coming to a complete stop, I saw a silvery sphere glowing a white light color.  It was extrememly fast and the light seemed to be coming from the front of the object and encompasing it.  The object flew over my head and continued in a southwesterly direction.  It was fairly high up in the air and it was about the size of a superball (large gumball) if held at arms length.;42.5703;-88.1341000000002
