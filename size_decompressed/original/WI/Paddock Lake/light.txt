Red light seen over Paddock Lake.;2013-07-03 21:15:00;2 minutes;Red light seen over Paddock Lake. Witnessed one red light travelling slowly in sky above Paddock Lake.  Originally thought it was an ember, but it was travelling in an L pattern and moved very slowly.   The red light was bright and looked just like a star.   After 2 minutes or so it completely disappeared.  I work for the ((public employee)) and my husband works as an automotive ((deleted)).   We have lived around here over 12 years and that isn't a normal light, or aircraft. It had no FAA lights.;42.5703;-88.1341000000002

The first time was a hovering light with a bright red light going from it to the ground and pulsating.  This was Jan 2011. Tonight we saw a hovering light that moved about and then north.  There was a red round light flashing from the ground in 3 quick flashes.  I drove out to try to find something but could not find it on the roadways.
