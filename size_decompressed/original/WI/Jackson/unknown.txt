I then noticed movement to the right side of the bright star. It was another star,but this star was moving,then came another,and another,they were evenly spaced apart. I counted between 30 to 40 of these things.They moved in a straight formation.When they got to a certain point in the sky they would disappear one by one and only when they got to that one spot in the sky ? These we're not satellites.;43.3255;-88.1644
