3 reddish orange objects spotted in formation.;1987-10-26 23:00:00;1 minute;3 reddish orange objects spotted in formation. We were driving South on 45 South just outside of Jackson.  My husband spotted three reddish orange objects in the sky.  I took a quick glance and said That's just a light tower. When I looked closer I realized this was like nothing I'd ever seen.  The objects were rising slowly in a triangular formation.   One quickly disappeared into the sky.  The other two were still visible, and I kept watching them until I could no longer see them.  The objects were not blinking like an airplane would.  They appeared almost like orange reddish balls with a translucent outer glow.  What a cool thing to see.   Also, neither of us drink!  A one hundred percent sober sighting.  I am still in shock regarding the sighting.;43.3255;-88.1644
String of 15 orange balls observed in Jackson, WI in the evening of Aug. 24, 2013;2013-08-24 20:30:00;10 minutes;String of 15 orange balls observed in Jackson, WI in the evening of Aug. 24, 2013 Location: East of Highway 45 at Highway 60. A loosely formed line of orange balls were observed traveling from south to north.  Speed and altitude appeared to be consistent with what would be expected from light aircraft.  Light intensity of all members of the formation remained consistent (no flashing or pulsating).  Orange color was deeper than that seen in Sodium vapor street lights.  Movement of the lights within their formation would best be characterized as undisciplined.  No sound came from these objects.  Objects did not seem to have any effect on surrounding environment (It was just like they were passing through).;43.3255;-88.1644
