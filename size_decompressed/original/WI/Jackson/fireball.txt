Two Unidentified Objects observed over Washington County (Wisconsin);2012-10-20 20:30:00;10 minutes;Two Unidentified Objects observed over Washington County (Wisconsin) I, along with my wife and son, witnessed two bright objects in the sky. The appeared motionless and were stacked one on top of the other. Unable to verify distance between two objects but appeared to be several hundred feet.  Objects appeared to be extremely bright stars. Brightness was pulsating. After approximately 90 seconds of observation the object that appeared to be on the bottom quickly moved to the north and then disappeared.   Approximately five minutes later the second object began to move north/northeast at a very slow velocity.  It appeared to zig zag slightly and then stopped momentarily.  Object 2 was almost directly overhead of our position and there was no noticeable sound.  Object 2 then began to quickly accelerate vertically and disappeared completely from sight within approximately 3 seconds. Witness I a private pilot with military background.;43.3255;-88.1644
