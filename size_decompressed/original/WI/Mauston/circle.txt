Driving in truck just at dusk on back country road we were driving east just north of wisconsin dells.  noticing corn harvester in the fields, then boyfriend says what the heck is thet up there we both look and up in the sky see three large lights near each other, the center one is the brightest then the other two light up and what appeared as though they all merged rapidly into one creating a bluish color prior to that they all appeared white, the sphere dropped slightly in the sky and then disappeared all together.   Five minutes later we are now driving south the sky is still at dusk we see an enormous falling star land just off the road into a field, it was the most unreal thing for it to have fallen that close to us just after seeing what appeared to be a UFO just minutes proir.  It was not completely dark so we could see off into the distance and into the sky there were no airplanes, or anything man made from the ground even remotly around.  It was unreal! ...!!!!!;43.7926;-90.0696
