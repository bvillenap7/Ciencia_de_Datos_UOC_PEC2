Starts as 4 lights, goes to 2 lights and then disappears At Woodside Ranch attending a conference.  Myself and two others were in the pool when one of my friends said to look in the sky.  Myself and my other friend turned to the north sky to see four red lights in a horizontal line.  They were above the treeline and were very large.  They were not like lights on an airplane, they were much, much larger.  There were four lights and then it went to just two lights (the end lights went out).  After it went to two lights, they went out and it disappeared.  We never really made out a space craft, we only saw the lights in the horizontal formation.  My friends and I believe we saw a UFO, but the fact that we saw what we believe to be 2 military jets fly by about ten minutes after the sighting made us wonder if the object was related to the jets and a military mission.  But it also made us wonder if the jets were sent to investigate the object that was seen.  Who knows, but we know we saw something very, very unusual.  I've never ever even thought I've seen a UFO in my entire life, but when I saw this object, I had no doubt that I had just seen something that could be one.  I would love to be contacted by an investigator to see if anyone else saw this thing or for information on what it could of been.;43.7926;-90.0696

The top one blinked quickly straight down then shot up at a diagonal to the left.  They then appeared again above one and another.   Then disappeared after 10 seconds.;43.7926;-90.0696
