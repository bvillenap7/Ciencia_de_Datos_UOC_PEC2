saw a moving light in the sky;1999-07-23 02:00:00;2 hours;saw a moving light in the sky We are a group of architecture students at the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture in Spring Green, Wisconsin. On Friday July 23 at 2.am, 6 of us walked outside to see a bright light in the eastern sky.  It was moving in a sporadic manner, as a fire fly would,although its light never died out.  At first its distance appeared to be up at the level of the trees, hence, the metaphor with the fire fly.  As we walked closer to it, we realized it was way up in the sky, at the distance an airplane might fly.  Its light was brighter than any star or planet and it emitted 3 major points of light. That is to say that it had an overall glow but it appeared to the squinted eye as three rays. The size of its light was at least 10 times bigger than any star.  The light continued to move in different directions although the movement was subtle, in that it did not cover large portions of the sky.  If you were to hold a ruler straight out it was moving within an area of two square inches.  However, we watched it for a good 45 minutes and it had changed its position in the sky by at least a foot.  Its movement was jagged in that it kind of oscillated back and forth but gained overall movement in one direction.  At certain times it moved steadily and there was one period of time where it moved in circular or elliptical fashion in a somewhat more energetic and less regular manner. Thank you for your attention.
