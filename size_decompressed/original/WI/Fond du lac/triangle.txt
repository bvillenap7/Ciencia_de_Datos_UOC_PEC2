Very fast moving rounded point triangle with fixed and dimly lit  round glowing area near each corner;2011-03-29 21:00:00;2 - 3 seconds;Very fast moving rounded point triangle with fixed and dimly lit  round glowing area near each corner Moving from sse to nnw. Time: approx. 9:15 pm 3/29/11 So there I was staring up at the night sky in the middle of my driveway, as I often do, looking I’m sure like some kind of nut case. It crossed a section of the sky so fast I could barely even comprehend that I was seeing a moving object.  It was so dim that I could barely make it out at all.  If I hadn’t been looking up at that exact moment I would have missed it. It moved silently and very fast. As I moved, turning my head and sidestepping  to follow it, I tripped on the dogs chain (the dog moved because I startled her with my sudden movement) and lost sight of it behind the neighbors tree. I can’t even guess at the altitude. I have no clue at all. If I was forced to make a guess I would say it was flying no higher than 1,000 feet but for all I know it could have been at 10,000 feet or more. I estimate the “sighting” to have lasted around two to three seconds and definitely no more than four seconds.  As far as the size goes I can only hold my arm out and guess that it was taking up a space of 1” to 1-1/2” inches at arm’s length in the night sky. Nobody else could have possibly seen it unless they happened to be looking up at that exact moment and exact place.  It was barely perceptible against the night sky.  Even if someone was next to me they would not have had time to look up and focus on it to verify it.  I did see what I just described.  No doubt in my mind at all.  None.;43.7737879344251;-88.451819606559
Sighting of huge yellowish triangular slow moving craft;2012-05-20 14:00:00;60 seconds;Sighting of huge yellowish triangular slow moving craft I was doing yard work in my backyard.  It was right before storms were moving into the area, but there was somewhat of a break in the clouds.  The triangular craft was extremely slow moving-maybe 30-40 mph at the most, and did not make any sound that I could hear.  It did not leave any type of trail. It took approximately 60 seconds for it to move across the break in the clouds, and disappear into the clouds out my sight.  The craft was somewhat golden/yellowish in color, but the color was flat and not metallic, and I did not notice any lights on it.  It had all kinds of venting/pipes of some sort on the back end with longer ones towards the outer edges.  It was huge-maybe 3-4 times the size of my home.  It must have been only 600-700 feet above ground, and seemed to be barely clearing the homes. I screamed at my neighbors who were outside gardening to look up at the sky.  They turned to look where I was pointing to, and shook their heads as if they saw it, but they didn’t seem to get very excited about it. Later I asked around town if anyone else had seen the craft, but no one had and there were no reports of it on the news.  It's very frustrating for me that no one seems to believe me.;43.7737879344251;-88.451819606559
