Fireball-like objects seen over Fond du Lac, Wi.;2010-05-14 23:30:00;15 minutes;Fireball-like objects seen over Fond du Lac, Wi. A friend and I were standing out in front of my house looking at the western sky, when we both noticed two(2) fireball-like objacts in the night sky.  They flew west to northeast towards the town of Pipe, Wi over Lake Winnebago.  They were moving too slow to be an airplane, and too fast to be anything else.  Originally thought of helicopters, but there was no noise.  Completely silent.  There were also no identifying marks such as red or green lights, saw no signs of wings, just the bright orange fires in the sky.   About fifteen(15) minutes later, when my friend was on his way home, he saw two more heading west to southeast heading towards Eden, Wi.

orange ball with sparkling rays omitting out of it moving across the sky;2010-06-20 21:20:00;5 minutes;orange ball with sparkling rays omitting out of it moving across the sky It was about 21:20 or so when my husband and I saw a round orange ball that looked like fireworks, but it didn't dissipate, but instead ascended up in the sky from the east.  It crossed above our home and went north.  It didn't move real fast and it had no sound.  It seemed rather close and if it were a plane it would have made noise, but there was no sound.  I was washing my face at the time, and so I rinsed it off and then went outside to see if I could still see it and I did see it continuing on to the north.  I didn't appear as a plane which usually isn't orange and, and a plane will have blinking lights or more than one light.  This was just orange.;43.7737879344251;-88.451819606559
Witnessed 18 to 20 fireball orange round orbs;2012-09-23 19:00:00;10 minutes;Witnessed 18 to 20 fireball orange round orbs We saw approximately eight groups of two to four very bright orange fireball round shape orbs.  They were flying one group after the other.  They started out very bright going east, then veered to the south and then they faded out.  There was no sound and they were flying at a fairly slow speed but not slow enough to be considered hoovering. They were all flying at a very simular altitude. This occurred at about 7:40 pm CST.  I do not know if there were more prior to me going outside.  The fireballs did not blink or flash.;43.7737879344251;-88.451819606559
