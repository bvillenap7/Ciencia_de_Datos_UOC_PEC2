very bright and silent light traveling across sky that camera captured as red and white bobber looking object.;2010-08-08 21:40:00;1 - 1.5 minutes;very bright and silent light traveling across sky that camera captured as red and white bobber looking object. Sunday evening at 9:40 P.M. about in the middle of town in a backyard. I noticed a single bright light at approximately a 50 degree angle up and to the east, traveling from south to north and was silent. The light was atleast 4 times biggerthan any star in the sky. The skies were clear except for a few clouds on the horizon to the north.  The object was intensely bright and had a shimmering copper look to it. It took the light approximately 1 to 1.5 minutes or so to reach the horizon where it blinked out over the clouds. I took a picture with my cell phone, and zoomed in on the photos revealing a bright round object with red/ orange on the top half and white on the bottom half.  There is also a slight yellow blur in the middle and a yellowish contrail.;43.7737879344251;-88.451819606559

White & circular approx. 3 hrs 2 arrived together did a dance.  One went up.;2014-10-05 02:00:00;3 hours;10/05/2014 midnight-3:30 Fond du Lac, WI white & circular approx.3 hrs 2 arrived together did a &quotdance&quot one went up the other On 10/05/2014 from midnight until 3:30 am  I was chatting with my IL friend about the AWESOME day I was having.  I live in a house on a busy highway & my living room is my mother's former master bedroom. This room has no curtains or drapes for the 8 windows it has. I was amazed by the 1st sighting of 2 circular white UFOs I saw that arrived together. They both seemed to wink at me with their lights as I told my IL friend while it was happening.  Then suddenly, one of the UFOs went up, while the other one went down.  The one on my right-hand-side went up & the left-hand-side one went down.  Then the UFOs split apart sideways & disappeared.   Not much long afterward, they returned to do the same dance & did that same dance one more time. I went to sleep on my couch at approximately 3:30 am & hung up with my friend a tad earlier after the (third) sighting when they disappeared.;43.7737879344251;-88.451819606559
dark circular object comes out of the clouds before disappearing back into them;2021-05-01 20:00:00;10 seconds;dark circular object comes out of the clouds before disappearing back into them I was laying in my backyard looking at the clouds when a black/dark gray circular object comes out of the clouds in the distance. It moved in a diagonal line across the sky before disappearing back into the clouds. Person I was with strangely enough didn’t see it when we were both staring at the sky. Whatever it was quiet and didn’t have any lights.;43.7737879344251;-88.451819606559
