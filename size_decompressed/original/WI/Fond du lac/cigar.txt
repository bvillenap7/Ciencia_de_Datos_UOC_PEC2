It was north of my position in central Fond du Lac, thus putting the object over North Fond du Lac and southern portion of Lake Winnebago, possible even over or nearly overhead of Oshkosh, WI. It had a very flat trajectory, but it appeared ever so slightly to be losing altitude.  It had silver sparks coming out of the trailing edge, reminiscent of the cheesy old Flash Gordon movies.  It was considerably faster than an airplane, but it wasn't going so fast as to be a blur.  It had a distinct cigar shape to it, and it made no discernible noise from my location that I could hear. At arm's length, the object would have been about half the width of my thumbnail, so I guess that's about a bit more than half of a centimeter. I only saw it for about 8 seconds, then I lost view when tree cover obscured my view. The reason I don't believe it was a bolide or meteor was because of its very flat trajectory.;43.7737879344251;-88.451819606559
