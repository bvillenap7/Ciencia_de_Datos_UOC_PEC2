Orange/red glowing orbs moving in procession over Fond du Lac, WI.;2013-03-14 21:00:00;30 minutes;Orange/red glowing orbs moving in procession over Fond du Lac, WI. Thursday, 14 March 2013, I witnessed something profoundly strange.   I was in my living room around 9 p.m. and noticed a bright red/orange light moving up the hill (I live at the top of this hill), approximately 300 feet above the ground.  I didn't think much of it until I noticed another one about 300 behind it following the exact path.  I was in the middle of an important phone call and tried to focus my attention on the call.  I looked away for several minutes and was quite surprised to see the procession still in progress when I looked back again.  I saw three at a time moving up the hill and at this time, I stepped barefoot out in the snow to listen for them.  They didn't make a sound and more continued to follow. In all, I witnessed at least a dozen - probably 2 dozen.  This is located along Hwy 23, east of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.  They were moving east. They seemed to turn and were out of my sight as they neared the top of the hill.  I plugged the description that I just gave you in my computer, expecting to something in the news.  Instead your site turned up.   I would not have reported it to you but I see some that they fit the same description. My sense was that I was watching a parade...a solemn parade. They moved slowly and deliberately.;43.7737879344251;-88.451819606559
Large star-like ball with lights hovering and then moving slowly into the distance.;2015-09-23 06:04:00;35 minutes;Large star-like ball with lights hovering and then moving slowly into the distance. I awoke and saw what I thought was a bright star and I stopped at the window to make a wish.  I looked for a few minutes and saw lights blink on either side and the top and thought,  Only a plane, but I watched it. It stayed in one place.  It hovered, moving slightly side to side and up and down.  It was moving.   I ran downstairs and grabbed my camera.  No clouds made it perfect to see how it moved.  Over the course of 30 minutes is moved away in the same spot, just further away.  After an hour it was a pin point in the sky.  I have it on video.;43.7737879344251;-88.451819606559
I saw all 19 craft travel from the W in a half circle to the N.  All craft were in a single line except few.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-15 21:00:00;2 minutes;I saw all 19 craft travel from the west in a half circle to the north. All craft were in a single line except a few were side by side. Traveled west to the north in a half circle pattern through the sky. I saw 1 and thought satellite but then they kept coming counting 19 in total. No noise and moved fairly fast. Iâ€™m in complete disbelief of what I saw and hope that there were other sightings to validate mine and hopefully an explanation.;43.7737879344251;-88.451819606559
