UFO was seen July 3, 2009 east of Eau Galle Wisconsin.  It was viewed from Highway 25 about 2-3 miles north of Durand, WI.  While there were fireworks in the area, the objects were seen before local fireworks display.  Absolutely not planes Venus, helicopters.  Absolutely not stars.  Three separate objects were seen.  At first, these 3 light red objects were seen in a diagonal line somewhat like the “ \ “ line.  Thought initially they were one object.  Would remind one of the pattern of the Phoenix lights but only three glowing balls, stationary.  First thought was 3 radio towers but objects were too high in the sky.  Viewed for about 15 -20 minutes.  One light slowly went up until it slowly faded – duration till fade about 4-5 minutes.  After the first light went up and slowly faded, the middle light did. Finally the third light did likewise.  Absolutely not airplanes.  About 20 minutes after the last light faded a plane did fly in the general area.  Much, much different.  This location is not too far from Elm Wood, WI.  General vicinity of Plum City, maybe 13 miles away;44.7157;-91.9766
