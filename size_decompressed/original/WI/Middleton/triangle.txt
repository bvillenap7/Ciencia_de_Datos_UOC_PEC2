In the early morning of April 17 2008 somewhere between 12:30am and 12:40am I was driving west on HWY 14 between Middleton and Cross Plains Wisconsin when I saw a strange yellow-golden light in the sky in front of me above the horizon. I first thought it was a planet because it was too bright to be a star, but noticed that it was too big to be a planet either. The road I was on headed straight towards the light that seemed fixed in the sky and as I kept driving (about 15 seconds or so) I realized that the light was no longer on then horizon, but now in my local area not more that a hundred yards in front of me and had transitioned from a yellow/golden light to a what appeared as a physical object with lights. As I continued forward I noticed a blue blinking light similar to an airplane, yet the object was completely stationary in the sky (so much so that I thought it may have been the lights on a radio tower, but I knew there were no radio towers in this area.)  I ended up driving almost directly under it and noticed there were more lights. I noticed about 5-8 different lights of different colors. They where blinking in unfamiliar patterns, not the standard, regular, repetitive way an airplaneâ€™s lights normal blink, but they seem to blink faster with irregularity much more swirly and flashy than standard airplane lights (like an artistic light show). I was only under it for a second or 2, but noticed that the lights were circular and had a wavy character as if it were passing through a waving liquid media. The object was not that high up, only about as high as a 20 story building and was absolutely fixed in the sky. It was dark out and the object appeared to be black and in the shape of a triangle and about as long as a city bus. I passed the object and could not view it anymore as it was a behind me. I stopped my car a minute or 2 later to look and it was gone. From the time I saw it in the distance on the horizon until I drove under it was about 30-45 seconds. I thought that this may have been a helicopter, but it had no psychical similarities to one and I drove almost directly under it and heard no sound.;43.1029999999999;-89.5073000000001
