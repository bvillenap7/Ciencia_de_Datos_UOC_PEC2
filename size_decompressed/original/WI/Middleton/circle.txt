I was about 3 or 4 miles west of the sth 12/14 interchange in Middleton, WI, when I noticed a red flashing orb at about the 5 o’clock position.  The orb caught my eye because my first thought was when did they put up a new TV tower and gosh it must be tall.   After a few seconds I realized it was moving rather quickly, and obviously not stationary.  Due to the color it was emitting, I noted it couldn’t be an airplane, as the size of the object would be way to large to be an aircraft’s strobe lights and there was no green or white light either.  I would guess it was also traveling 2 or 3 times faster than your standard jet based on how quickly it was moving away from me.   Then when it was starting to near the end of my visible horizon it took a hard left heading northerly with a slight downward trajectory while also to remarkably double its original speed and quickly went out of view.   I would like to stress this light was definitely not a reflection from within the cab of my vehicle nor a light somehow reflecting off my windshield.   I would estimate this light was originally flying several thousand feet off the ground, maybe 2 or 3 in my best estimation before making its turn and descent.   The light it emitted was rather unusual, as it appeared to have a slightly foggy characteristic about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
