Three lights in a row moved over Madison, WI.;2006-08-02 20:45:00;5 minutes;Three lights in a row moved over Madison, WI. There were three lights in a row:  white, white, blue.  I at first thought it was an airplane, but the object circled in a way that an airplane cannot.  The lights remained stable in relation to each other as the object moved.  It was high enough that at times one or more of the lights were hidden by the clouds.  It moved more like a kite than a plane or helicopter, yet the lights were large enough that I doubt a kite could have held them at that altitude.  The object moved in a straight line, curved, stood still, moved up and down.  There was no sound.  After about five minutes it disappeared behind the tree line, and I did not see it again.  I do not know how long it was in the sky before I first saw it. I am a forty-five year old white female, a teacher, college-educated.  I have never seen a UFO before.  This took place at about 8:45 PM, it was dark and overcast.  It took place in Middleton, WI, on the edge of Madison.;43.1029999999999;-89.5073000000001
