Bright light traveling east to west at a fast speed;2012-06-25 22:00:00;seconds;Bright light traveling east to west at a fast speed Sometime between 10 and 10:30 p.m. while watching TV I looked out the window and saw a very bright light fly by going east to west and then disappear.  It wasn’t a shooting star as it was too bright and traveled in a straight line really fast.  A few minutes later my daughter looked out the window and saw the same thing.  It scared her enough she wouldn’t go to sleep by herself.;43.1029999999999;-89.5073000000001
Bright Lights, 12-15 flying together, moving under power, much brighter than anything I have ever seen.  (Starlink satellites?);2020-09-12 22:00:00;30-60 seconds;Bright Lights, 12-15 flying together, moving under power, much brighter than anything I have ever seen in the night sky At about 10pm on Saturday 9/12/20 my wife and I saw 12-15 very bright lights, bright orange, solid Orange and not blinking, seemed round but only saw light and wasnt able to see structure, moving over our house, from the South, then slowly veering and heading to the East. Very bright lights, much larger and brighter than any aircraft (plane/Helicopter), All moving together in the same direction but their proximity to each other continually changed, no sound, all in our field of view but spread out, not in a line. It took about 30 seconds to 1 minutes before they left our field of view. Not meteors or shooting stars, much bigger and brighter, with no tails or trails of light, not SpaceX (I know what that would look like and SpaceX would be much smaller, and not near as bright, and I think SpaceX would be in a straight line from what I am seeing online). I have been researching online all morning and am unable to find anything that could be man made. They seem! to have been under power as they changed direction and moved much faster than a flare, drone, or weather balloon.;43.1029999999999;-89.5073000000001
