Orb over central Wisconsin;2007-06-11 16:00:00;60-90 seconds;Orb over central Wisconsin While sunbathing I observed an orb like object traveling at an incredible rate of speed in the sky above.  It had a dark - metallic look to it, and appeared to be extremely high in the atmosphere.  It moved in a perfect straight line across the sky, when it was towards the middle of the horizon, it looped around and made a small , perfect, circular  motion and then continued on its normal flight path. For the elevation it was at, it had to have been far faster than any aircraft, however, it wasn't so fast that it was a blur.  It cleared the entire horizon in about 60-90 seconds.  There was no blinking or flashing, no sounds, and no exhaust.  The sky was perfectly clear so I could observe it very well.  Also, although it was circular, when it was directly above my view, I notice it did have slightly contoured edges.  Kind of like a more compact, and curved boomerang, however, the wings or triangualr shape was very subtle and could only be observed when it was directly overhead.;43.1029999999999;-89.5073000000001
Spherical red and white bright light moving strangely.;2012-04-11 20:22:00;4 seconds;Spherical red and white bright light moving strangely. I was driving home, heading West when I saw something that resembled a big shooting star in the sky while I was driving downhill. It headed North.  Suddenly the shooting star became brighter (so bright that it brightened the top leaves of some tall trees up in the hill) and bigger and it appeared to spin, like a sphere, in red, white and yellow lights.  After that it slowed down and disappeared as if had exploded in tiny little particles or something.  Very VERY different from a meteor reaching atmosphere. I have never seen anything like it, apparently neither have the other drivers. 3 cars almost crashed and all I heard were people yelling inside their vehicle in amazement.  I called a friend to inform what I have seen.  He lives by the airport and in 5 minutes he said there were F15 airships taking up flight from the East side airport (at 8pm... weird).;43.1029999999999;-89.5073000000001
