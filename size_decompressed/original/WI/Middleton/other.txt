Column of flashing white lights;2007-08-20 04:30:00;10 minutes;Column of flashing white lights I’ve never seen a UFO before but I’ve always wanted too.  I’m a skeptic but a believer.  This incident occurred on my way to work at 0430 between Waunakee, Wi. 53597 and Middleton, Wi. 53562.  As I was driving on county hwy K and heading west between county hwy Q and US hwy 12, I saw a column of lights that resemble the broadcast towers that dot the west side of Madison, Wi. which is adjacent to Middleton.  Initially, I instinctively interpreted this column of flashing lights as one of the broadcast towers off in the distance.  This thought did not follow through in my mind though.  As soon as I focused on the road ahead again I immediately returned my gaze to the lights again.  This was not hard to do for the traffic at 0430 is nonexistent.  I was able to slow my car speed and observe.  What I observed was a tower of flashing white lights not far off in the countryside.  My calculated guess would be about ¼ - ½ mile.  The countryside here is farmland – dark as night can be.  I always enjoy viewing the stars at this time of morning on my way to work. There are few things that I enjoy better than the night sky.  I must say that after I concluded that what I was seeing was a possible UFO mimicking a TV tower, I burst into laughter at the thought of concealment by looking like a tower of lights.  Beautiful!!  This column continued to move in a westerly direction as I turned toward Middleton on to US hwy 12 heading south.  I didn’t stop to view it any longer as I continued on into work.  Sooo….it was observed by me for approximately 10 min.  I just recently decided to report this observation because I believe that what I saw was not part of the normal fauna of my path to work.  I also continued to look each morning thereafter at the towers that do exist there and the distance and size they actually are.  They are extremely further away to my sighting and observations.  I didn’t count the number of flashing lights but they were all flashing white.  The height of the light tower I find difficult to estimate but will guess at between 100 -200 yds.  As for closeness to the ground  It was definitely off the ground.  I will not try to guess. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Glowing orange barrel-shaped objects in sky over town of Middleton, WI;2010-10-01 08:30:00;3 minutes ?;Glowing orange barrel-shaped objects in sky over town of Middleton, WI My husband and 3 children, as well as a neighbor, and two of her children, were having a fire in our backyard firepit.  There are no streetlights, so our sky is dark, and you can see the stars very clearly. Between 8:00 and 8:30ish, we noticed a group of barrel shaped glowing orange lights coming from the near northern side of our neighborhood.  There was no sound, that we could detect,coming from the objects.They popped up out of nowhere, one by one, and floated at a moderate speed across the sky in a southerly direction, not very high, and eventually went into the clouds and disappeared (we could no longer see the glowing of the objects in the clouds)about a quarter of a mile for our home, as we could judge. We had no sense of fear, just pure surprise and curiosity.  I took photos as soon as I could run into the house and find my camera. My camera revealed some barrel shaped and some flatter oval objects, glowing as if on fire, or very hot.;43.1029999999999;-89.5073000000001
I saw four black helicopters flying southwest in a single file formation, only the one in front had lights on.;2013-11-02 20:35:00;1 minute;I saw four black helicopters flying southwest in a single file formation, only the one in front had lights on. I was in a store parking lot in Middleton, WI, at 8:35PM on Saturday, November 2, 2013.  As I exited the store, and began to walk towards my car, I heard helicopters and saw a bright white headlight in the north-western sky.  Four black, or very darkly colored helicopters approached very quickly in an almost offset single file formation.  The bright headlight was on the front of the first helicopter, while the only light on the others were red colored taillights.  The three trailing the first helicopter were barely visible except for the taillights and portions of their shapes that could be seen when they passed over lighter/illuminated clouds.  They were flying south-east. I know that this is not an actual UFO sighting, but I could not find anything about this event online or in the news.  And I am uncertain where they would have been flying from or to..  I don’t know of any military installation nearby.  There is a small airport in Middleton, basically in the direction they were coming from.;43.1029999999999;-89.5073000000001
