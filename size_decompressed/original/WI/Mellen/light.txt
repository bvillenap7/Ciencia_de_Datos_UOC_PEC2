This light appeared to be hovering over the Penokee Mountain range, near the same vicinity as the famous 1975 Baker Family UFO report.;2016-09-11 02:45:00;2 hours;Around 2:45AM Sunday morning my fiance and I witnessed a very strange light to the East of Mellen.  This light appeared to be hovering over the Penokee Mountain range, near the same vicinity as the famous 1975 Baker Family UFO report.  This light which I was very skeptical of, appeared white, and occasionally rotated itself to have an amber glow.  This light would move left, right, up and down but never too far away from where we originally spotted it.  We could hear the hum of a jet airliner in the distance, we soon seen the airliner approach way up in the sky, watched its lights to compare. No similarity as one might expect.  Finally I was a little bored and annoyed by the light because I had no binoculars, scopes or anything to get a closer look.  At 4:45AM exactly, fog started to roll in over the mountain range.  With this fog, we could see beams of lights coming from the craft.  It was at this time I was certain we were watching a UFO.  At 5AM, suddenly it moved upwards about 300 feet, moved left, and darted straight East and up until we could no longer see it.
