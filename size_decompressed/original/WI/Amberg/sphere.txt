Orange sphere traveling north turning 90 degrees and go west;2015-08-15 20:49:00;5 minutes;Orange sphere traveling north turning 90 degrees and go west I observed an orange glow towards the southeast and thought it to be the planet Mars or Venus the first star in the sky.  I continued unloading my trailer and proceeded to unhitched it and then started rolling up my hold down straps.  That is when I noticed that the star was moving at a slow speed to the north.  It was not flashing.   I grabbed my phone and began recording the last 2 plus minutes, it slowly moved until it was approximately directly to my west when it stopped, stayed there for awhile, then moved directly west until it went behind the tree tops. I sent my video to my brother and brother in law and my brother in law said it looked similar to one he had observed at the same place 20 years ago.;45.583;-88.1170666666667
