I’d like to get some opinions or input.;2013-09-23 23:15:00;Months;I’d like to get some opinions or input. For several months I’ve been seeing objects in the sky over Neillsville. At first I thought it was a star, then I noticed that it is a combination of white, red, and green lights. When observed through a small set of binoculars, you can get better details of the lights. When viewed through a stronger set of binoculars, it appears to look like a disco ball that is comprised of either squares, or triangles. It pulsates, and changes color from white, to green, to red, to purple. Some friends feel that they are UFOs, some friends feel they are communication satellites. Most satellites traverse the sky in a geosynchronous orbit from what I understand. These objects are for the most part stationary.  They usually are in the same place each night but they do change position slightly. I’ve been told that communication satellites are stationary. These move occasionally.  One night I watched them for about an hour, and the one I was watching eventually moved off into the distance. I’ve heard that Neillsville is a hot spot for UFOS because for the magnetic polarity that is part of the glacial formations around the area. There is a bombing range located in Pittsville that is about an hour away, so it could be part of that. There are now about 12-15 of them that appear every night. What I cannot figure out is, if they are UFOS, why are they appearing every night, and what would 12-15 UFOS see in Neillsville?  On the other side, why would a communication satellite look like a pulsating disco ball that changes color, and why would you need 12-15 of them over a city with a population of about 2,500 in the middle of Amish farm country?  I’ve lived here for about 14 years and never saw them till this Spring and now they seem to be a constant in the sky. I’d love any input and opinions.;44.5495;-90.6078
