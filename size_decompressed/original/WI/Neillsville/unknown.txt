red-yellow-blue lights in southern-western sky in Neillsville WIS;2004-01-12 18:30:00;5 minutes;red-yellow-blue lights in southern-western sky in Neillsville WIS This sighting occured on a clear night no lights from the city since the city is to the north and sighting was to the south-south western sky.  Craft shape was hard to decern.  The craft had lights red-blue-yellow which flashed and had white lights on the edges of the craft.  The craft was at an altitude of approximately 500-600 feet above the ground at a distance of approx 1-2 miles I think.  It was hard to judge distance.  There was no sounds that I could hear.  There was no wind. Air temp. was approx 20F.  There were stars out.  The craft apparently was hovering since it was not moving in any direction.  My two dogs where very restless and were angerly growling towards the same direction as the craft.  I watched the craft for about 3-5 minutes trying to see a shape or rule out other explainations such as aircraft or a star or planet.   However, there was no movement, no sounds, and the lights did not strobe like that of an aircraft. There was no vapor trail that I could see.  I went into the house to get the camcorder to zoom in on the craft and film it.  I was in the house for approx 5 minutes. When I returned, the craft was gone.  I have not seen it since, however a nieghbor approx. 1 1/2 miles away did see the same craft on the same night at the exact same time.;44.5495;-90.6078
