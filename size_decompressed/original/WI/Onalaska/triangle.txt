Unusual object flying to the east with no noise.;2006-10-28 04:44:00;15-30 secs;Unusual object flying to the east with no noise. I stepped out onto my deck and as usual looked into the sky. I was looking at the constilation Orion when some motion to the left caught my eye.  I looked and I saw a triangular object dip down to within a thousand feet, fly to the east for a few seconds, and then fly back up.  The object was triangular, lt. bluish/grey luminescent in color and the ends were glowing red.  It was moving fast, but not unusually fast.  What was strangest though, was the lack of any sound whatsoever. I watch planes fly all the time and i haven't seen anything move that fast with no noise.

Saw triangle craft hovering and then slowly moved north. orangish, red and blue lights  pulsing... no noise.    I ran in my house to get a camera, but it disappeared by the time I got outside. It was not an airplane, however the week before several military helicopters were flying over about the same time of night.  You could hear and see that they were helicopters.  I have no idea what this was.;43.9000999999992;-91.2276000000009
Black triangle outlined by white glowing dots.  Big white light in middle.;2019-03-29 23:40:00;20 seconds;Black triangle outlined by white glowing dots.  Big white light in middle. My two friends and I were stargazing from the back of a truck in my driveway.  As we were looking up, we saw a big black triangle outlined by small white lights.  My friend claims it had a bigger white circle in the middle.  The other friend says it looked kind of like a black butterfly?  It's weird because I can't remember most of it.  All I remember is vaguely what it looked like and how scared I was.;43.9000999999992;-91.2276000000009
