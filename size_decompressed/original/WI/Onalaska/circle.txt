As I got out of my car upon returning home from work, I looked up into the sky to see a dimly lit, round object high up above my home. It appeared to be illuminated underneath and was da dim red color barely noticeable but it could still be picked out in the light cloud cover it moved into. It moved from North West to the South East at a high rate of speed and then began to slow somewhat. My outdoor flood light which is on a motion sensor went off illuminating myself in the backyard and I then saw the object slow down and hover for about five minutes. My flood lamp timed out and shut off and I then watched the object move off to the South West. It was almost as if the thing was watching me watching it because it did not stop and hover until my flood light went off.;43.9000999999992;-91.2276000000009
