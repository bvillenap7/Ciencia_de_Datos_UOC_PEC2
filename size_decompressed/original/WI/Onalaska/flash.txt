Night sky turns blue as objects shoot from the sky;2010-04-14 22:06:00;20 seconds;Night sky turns blue as objects shoot from the sky We were sitting out side and the night sky turned bright blue. We turned around and looked up and it looked like bright heat lighting covering the sky.  It ended with one ball of light turning into two, then three of what looked like shooting stars but all lined up in a row shooting down from the clouds.  Hard to explain but it was crazy it seemed like and explosion or something, but plenty of people around town saw it.;43.9000999999992;-91.2276000000009
