2 objects or fireballs  travelling at high speeds over West Central Wisconsin;2000-07-13 22:23:00;8 minutes;2 objects or fireballs  travelling at high speeds over West Central Wisconsin At approximately 22:23 hours on 13 July 2000, I was out on my deck having a cigarette when I happened to look up at the sky and noticed the little dipper to the north. As I observed the sky, I saw a bright object much like a fireball of bluish white light streak across the sky from approximately where the little dipper is to 24(I used a ruler for scale)south east of the constellation. The object gradually lessened in intensity and almost seemed to disappear but then I noticed it had not disappeared but had slowed and was hovering east of my home and was now about the same brightness as the surrounding stars. In fact, I thought I had lost it at first because it looked so much like a star. Then, the object began to grow brighter and brighter until it reached approximately the same color as it was when I initially saw it and zoomed off to the east. Shortly after the first object took off to the east, a second object which appeared to be much lower than the first crossed the sky in about the same path except lower at a high rate of speed. I would estimate that the object crossed the distance(the 24)in roughly 1 to 2 seconds. I considered all the possible explainations for what I had just seen but could find no explaination for what they were. There were no port or starboard recognition lights or beacons on these craft, they made no noise and they travelled at a very high rate of speed. The fact that the one hovered for so long before again streaking off rules out any kind of space debris burning up in the atmosphere. I am at a loss to figure it out. Thank you.;43.9000999999992;-91.2276000000009
Three red objects in he sky above Onalaska Wi at 9:30 PM July 3rd 2011;2011-07-03 21:30:00;10 minutes;Three red objects in he sky above Onalaska Wi at 9:30 PM July 3rd 2011 Red in color almost like a fire ball coming from the South heading North at first I thought it was a airplane but as it got closer it seemed to hover above us.  Rough guess about 5000 ft above us.  As we continued to watch two more red like objects appeared one above and one below.  One of the weirdest things we have ever seen.  Just wondering if anyone else saw the same thing hard to explain, but it was real.9:30 PM  Onalaska Wi.;43.9000999999992;-91.2276000000009
Yellow/Orange fireball type objects flying in triangular formation hovering just north of the La Crosse, WI airport over Lake Onalaska.;2013-09-07 20:22:00;10 minutes;Yellow/Orange fireball type objects flying in triangular formation hovering just north of the La Crosse, WI airport over Lake Onalaska From approximately 20:20 to 20:28 I witnessed 12 fireball shaped objects in the sky that were flying in formation.  Four separate triangular shaped formations, which consisted of 3 fireball objects in each triangular formation.  At different times, one fireball object would break away from their triangular formation and move in very rapid movement appearing to move horizontally away from their group of three fireballs and then rapidly rejoin their formation after 3 to 4 rapid movements away from their group of three.  The four groups of three went from a straight line and then formed a “V” shape almost like a flight of geese does.  I spoke with three other individuals who also saw it, but I also witnessed other people along my drive who were pointing to them in the sky.  This took place over Lake Onalaska, just north of the La Crosse airport, between La Crosse, WI and Onalaska, WI.  The fireballs moved too erratically and were shaped too round to be convent! ional, manmade aircraft.  They seemed to have the ability to cloak themselves because one minute they were visible and the next they were gone.  They had the ability to hover, but they also had the ability to move very quickly as well.  I’ve never witnessed anything like it.  I was driving south on Hwy 35 and attempted to call my wife on my cell phone who was at a friend’s house to see if she could see what I was witnessing and my cell phone was unable to get a signal to complete the call.  The area I was in always has a cellular signal available, but I can only speculate that the objects in the sky had the ability to disrupt the cellular signal, because once they were no longer visible, the cellular communications were restored.  When I made it to the location where my wife was at, three other people at the house saw what I was talking about the strange thing is, from their location only three of the fireball objects were visible…again I can only speculate that from their! perspective the other objects were cloaked.  Cellular signals! were sp otty for the rest of the night.  The time of the sighting was during dusk or sunset lighting….again speculation that maybe that type of lighting makes it difficult for their objects to cloak themselves.  These objects were in my opinion definitely not manmade.;43.9000999999992;-91.2276000000009
