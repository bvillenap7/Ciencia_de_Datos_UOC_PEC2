Split Second Encounter Over West Central Wisconsin;2001-06-04 23:31:00;less than 1 minute;Split Second Encounter Over West Central Wisconsin While standing out on my deck just a few minutes ago, I happened to look up into the sky. We have sporadic clouds right now and a very bright moon. As I looked up, I saw what appeared to be a star to the West of my location. As soon as I saw it, the object began to get a bright white color leading me to think that the object was an aircraft on approach to our local airport. Just then, the object moved very quickly to the right(or North)of its original position very quickly and disappeared behind cloud cover. I am going to take my nightshot videocam out and see if it appears again. There were two distinct orbs of light but whether or not it was one or two objects I cannot be certain.;43.9000999999992;-91.2276000000009
