Unidentified Triangle shaped craft with lights in each corner, spotted for the 4th time in Chippewa Falls.;2010-03-23 20:58:00;Around 1 Minute;Unidentified Triangle shaped craft with lights in each corner, spotted for the 4th time in Chippewa Falls. March 23, 2010 at 8:58PM I was on my way to pick up a friend. I was sitting at a stop sign and I am not sure why, but I looked up and I saw a Triangle shaped craft. It had a light on each corner, and was moving fast, and it had too low of an altitude to be going as fast as it was. It was low enough to the ground that I can tell you without that it was not any airplane I have ever seen ( My Father is in the U.S Military, so I have been to plenty of military bases around the U.S and have seen many planes ). It was like I previously stated, a triangle shaped craft, but made no sound. And at the low altitude the craft was at, and the speed it was flying, I would assume I would have heard some noise. Not far ahead of the craft was and airplane, I believe to be a commuter. The craft made a very sharp, almost 90 degree bank, and headed towards the planes direction.  This is not the first time I have seen this type of triangle shaped craft in Chippewa Falls. There have been 3 other encounters with this same type of unidentified craft. This sighting was the first where I have been alone without any witnesses to back up my encounter. The previous 3 had 2 other witnesses not including me in the vehicle at the time.;44.9333999999999;-91.3911999999996
