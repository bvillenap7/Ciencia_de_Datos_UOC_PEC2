Two extremely loud electical/plastic sounding/zapping explosions overhead at 9:45pm on 09/22/01;2001-09-22 21:45:00;3 sec each, 5 min total;Two extremely loud electical/plastic sounding/zapping explosions overhead at 9:45pm on 09/22/01 Just as I was falling asleep at about 9:45pm (I had to be up for work at 5:00am). I was startled by an incredible electical popping/banging sound. I jumped out of bed and ran to the window. I saw nothing. I thought maybe fireworks were set off in the neighborhood. I went back to bed. Just as I pulled the sheets up, I heard a second, same kind of noise. To be descriptive, it sounded as if someone has put a tupperware container in a microwave oven and left the lid on which caused a plastic sounding explosion/bang, but ten times the noise. I covered my ears after each explosion it was so loud. My cat was obviously distrubed and immediately headed for the basement. After the second explosion I looked out front and saw most of the nieghbors in the area turning on their porch lights and looking around outside. I thought it resembled a sonic boom or space debris re-entering the atmosphere.;44.9333999999999;-91.3911999999996
