Assumed it was drones or quadcopters at first. As we got closer, I thought maybe Chinese lanterns. We went under them and turn East on 50th Ave.  Still could not identify what they were. Crossed the overpass and pulled over, to see if we could see them yet.  Got out of the car and looked up.  They maintained an equal distance from each other and traveled in a straight line Easterly, much slower than a meteor, which we were watching for.  They passed slightly to the North of us and after they passed by, the leading one faded out and the second one started to fade also. Both had reddish orange glow with a flickering orange center. Guessing they were about 1000 feet high or lower.;44.9333999999999;-91.3911999999996
