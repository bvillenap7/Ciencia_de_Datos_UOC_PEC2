Multi-colored flashing lights hovering over small-town in Wisconsin;2004-07-10 02:00:00;20 minutes;Multi-colored flashing lights hovering over small-town in Wisconsin I went to let my dog out when I saw what looked like a blinking star in the western sky. On closer inspection I saw it was changing colors. I ran inside and grabbed binoculars, what I saw was slightly diamond shaped I think (it was blurred a bit) with flashing lights in blue, red, green, yellow, and white. It seemed to be moving back and forth very slowly.I woke up my parents and told them to get outside and look. I said I wanted a witness so they couldn't call me crazy. They both looked and saw what I had seen. I then saw what appeared to be an airplane with the usual red light flashing fly towards the lights. I lost sight of it when I noticed another set of blinking changing lights towards the north. This one was moving towards the west in the direction of the other object. We came inside and 5 minutes later I went back outside and they were gone. I know there is a chance I saw weather balloons but what I can't account for is how uncomfortable I felt as I watched them. Not scared but just not right. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a twinkling star, or some other celestial body, would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witnesses were looking at a genuine UFO.
