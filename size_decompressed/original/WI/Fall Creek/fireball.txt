At least 6 lights, 4 in formation.;2018-04-12 22:00:00;30 seconds;At least 6 lights, 4 in formation. I was driving home from work at 10:00 PM. As I approached the main highway coming from a county road, I noticed at least 6, possibly 7 bright golden/reddish lights in the sky.  They appeared to be quite low, and the sky was cloudy and overcast.   Four of the lights were in perfect diamond formation, and two were below the formation.  They slowly stretched out, as if to form a line, and they appeared to be slowly moving west.   I turned on the highway and was driving into town, and lost sight of them.  When I got into town, I drove to the edge of town, hoping to see them again but they were gone.;44.7684;-91.2856
