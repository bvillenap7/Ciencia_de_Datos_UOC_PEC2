From Friendship, Wisconsin, bright orange lights seen in eastern sky below full moon on 1/10/01.;2001-01-10 19:36:00;15 minutes;From Friendship, Wisconsin, bright orange lights seen in eastern sky below full moon on 1/10/01. My wife and I saw what appeared to be AT LEAST five bright orange lights at a considerable distance of perhaps several miles in the eastern sky toward the full moon but only about 1/2 as high up in the sky. These lights appeared to be ascending southward at a steep angle, were about as bright as Venus (which was in the western sky), and appeared about the same size as Venus. They only appeared for about a second or two and then faded out, one at a time. They were spaced somewhat equidistantly from each other. When one was fading, another was increasing in intensity. I counted five in one short interval of time however, there appeared to be more similar lights (southward) through the clouds and treetops as we turned and proceeded to go to our home about 1/4 mile south. I called this observation into the Sheriff's Department (Adams County, Wisconsin) and then went back outside to see if we could see anything else. We saw what appeared to be two very fast strobe lights, probably on two jets, coming from the south. These lights circled the area where the orange lights had appeared and then headed back south. We saw the orange lights at 7:36 p.m. and the strobe lights were last seen at 7:51 p.m. this evening. We have never seen anything similar to this before.  So far this morning,January 11th, we have not heard any reports of others sighting these lights.;43.9876;-89.8198
Line of White Lights in Slanted Formation;2011-11-14 21:00:00;few seconds;Line of White Lights in Slanted Formation In northwest sky, noted a line formation of 5-7 white lights which lit up in a line formation - one-by-one. The lights went out as fast they they lit up -again in a line formation.  The line was slanted and the illumination started at the bottom of the formation.   It was similar to the sightings posted on 11/17/08 in the Oshkosh/Omro area of Wisconsin.  I did note a separate aircraft which appeared like a regular airplane that flew just below this line of light formation.  The airplane was traveling to the west.   These were 2 separate entities - the line of lights was not part of the airplane.  I also had spotted a falling star near the area about 20 minutes prior to this sighting.;43.9876;-89.8198
