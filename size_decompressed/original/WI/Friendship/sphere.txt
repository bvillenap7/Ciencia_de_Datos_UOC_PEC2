Bright orange light over Friendship, WI.;2011-07-02 23:00:00;2-3 Minutes;Bright orange light over Friendship, WI. My father and I were sitting out on his deck watching the stars.   Suddenly, I saw a bright orange light with a halo appear over the trees to the west.  It was roundish in shape.   Due to it being 4th of July weekend I immediately thought it was a firework, but when it didn't explode, I yelled to my dad, “What the hell is that?”   We both jumped up and it just kept rising and heading south east.  There was no sound what so ever and it was faster and lower than a plane.    We were banging on the window for my mother and sister to come out.  By the time they ran out it just disappeared into the sky.   Then a few minutes later over the same trees I saw the orange light again, this time both my parents, my sister and I saw it.  It followed the exact same pattern, distance, and height as the first one.    We stayed out for about a half hour waiting and looking and there were no other sightings.;43.9876;-89.8198
