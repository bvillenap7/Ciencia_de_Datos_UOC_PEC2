I looked at the skies and noticed pulsating light like a star pulsating with 7 sec intervals betwen flashes. I was watching these event for 20 min and then called my son, who conformed this event and latery wife.  Light was not moving and stayed in the same place.  I detected position of object in comparison with position of Big Dipper and made some drawings.  Right know I am putting together my telescope and going outside, because it is still there.  I tried to reach you on the phone immediately but it was imposssible to leave any massage.  Mail box was full.  I also videotaped the object but it was too dark and I don't know if I got anything.  If you have any questions , please call me on my cell 608-((number deleted))   I am going again  outside now.   Thank you, ((name deleted)) 11:35 PM;43.9876;-89.8198
