Hovering craft with illuminated cross in its center.;1993-06-01 22:00:00;1+ hours;Hovering craft with illuminated cross in its center. My wife and I saw a hovering craft in the western sky at approximately 10pm during late spring, early summer 1993.  The craft was at the 11 o'clock position in the sky.  There was no sound associated with the craft. When viewed through binoculars an illuminated cross could be seen.  It appeared to be an inverted tear shaped object.  We viewed it for more than an hour and a half.;43.1099999999999;-88.4889999999997
