Bright object seen darting in the night sky.;1991-06-15 22:00:00;5 Minutes;Bright object seen darting in the night sky. A bright white oval, seen moving very quickly up and down as well as side to side, in ways that rule out both a conventional airplane as well as some sort of helicopter. It followed in the same general direction as the road from which it was seen (out the rear right pasenger window) headed aproximatly south. Afther about five minutes the object flew away at a speed  that was fast enough to leave a bringt trail of light behind it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Two lights following a third, rotational maneuvering;2011-07-30 20:30:00;30 seconds;Two lights following a third, rotational maneuvering We were star gazing and watching for passing satellites.  We noticed what looked like another satellite (small glowing circle) on the eastern horizon, approximately 35-45 degrees up. We then noticed what looked like two other satellites following the first, stacked on top of each other, moving at the same speed (see below for representation). Speed and size of the objects looked to be the same as other satellites overhead, although the brightness of these objects was somewhat subdued (could have been due to atmosphere-shadow and/or small size of objects, or even light pollution from Milwaukee city lights). Initial Sighting position:  *2  *1  *3  After ~5 seconds of the initial formation, lights 2 & 3 rotated clockwise 270 degrees to the final formation represented below - the clockwise motion of objects 2 & 3 was relatively fast & extremely smooth, maintaining the same distances from each other, instantly starting and stopping the rotation from and to the represented positions.   All three objects also maintained their northern direction and speed. Final Sighting Position: *1*2 *3  It was shortly after this that we lost sight of the objects, apparently due to Earth-shadow. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi peter. Thanks for your return mail. The time was approx between 8pm and 9pm. That was the time i usually had to be home. It was definately summer Aug / Sept and the year i think was 1979. I know Im a little vague with dates but Im 46 now. I hope this helps in some way.  from my nokia n8 ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time changed above.  PD));43.1099999999999;-88.4889999999997
Light descends and makes a sharp left turn;2013-09-15 20:13:00;8 seconds;Light descends and makes a sharp left turn My friend and I were walking our dogs through a local cemetery in town and we always stop along the river to talk and to watch the night sky.  It was 8:13pm, and due north between the big dipper and the north star my friend first spotted a ball of light that appeared in the sky.  The ball of light appeared to get brighter and fall rapidly, from where it first appeared, it descended in a straight line towards earth, than it made a loop de loop (one complete circle), than it went right and left in a roller coaster type of action, and it made a very sharp left turn going west.  As the light made a sharp left turn the brightness faded and it seemed to have slowed down after it made the left turn and the ball of light began to fade and than as fast as it appeared it was gone. My friend and I stayed there till 9:30pm, and the clouds began to move in.  We did not see anything more.  My friend who is very skeptical, truly could not explain this.  This particular object was capable of descending in an almost straight line towards earth and make a loop, than turn right and left, before making a sharp left turn and at that point it slowed down, as though it was like airplane traffic speed in the sky.  All of this took less than 8 seconds.;43.1099999999999;-88.4889999999997
