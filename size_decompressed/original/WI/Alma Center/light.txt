Two Bright  Lights in three weeks sighted;2011-10-28 06:00:00;10 seconds;Two Bright  Lights in three weeks sighted About three weeks ago I was sitting in my chair in my living room about 7:00 at night.  I just happen to look out my window and I saw a bright light stop over my woods. I watched it for about 8-15 seconds and then it took off and was gone.  It came and left a a very great speed.  I told my son about it that night.  Now today(this morning) 10-28-011  I was awake in bed and so was my wife.  She was staring out through our bedroom window and the electricity went out for about 10 seconds.  I did not think anything about it at the time.  As I was just laying there staring at the ceiling.  Later in the morning she said she saw a bright light in the east when the electicity went out in the morning.  When the electicity came on she said the object dissapeared.  I asked her why didnt she say something when it happened?  And her reply was she didn't think I would off belived her.   Then I told her what had happened to me  a few weeks earlier.  She sounded relieved tha! t I told her that.;44.4452;-90.9356
Bright slow moving light.;2016-07-23 22:00:00;4 minutes;Bright slow moving light. I was on  road county F outside of Alma Center coming home.  To the East about a half a mile away I saw a very bright light, brighter than any of the stars around it.  It was fairly low to the ground as the stars were above it.  I got my range finder out of my car as I had stopped to observe it.  This range finder is also 8x power, so you can use it to view objects.  I could see it had some sort of structure to it but it was also very bright so it was hard to make out detail.  I was directly in its path as it looked like it was going to pass right overy me.  There was no sound at all to the object.  It was moving  at about 35 to 40 miles per hour estimate.  I decided to turn my range finder on it when it looked like it was in range of my finder.  I got a reading of 329 yards of of it.  Then all of a sudden it turned its light directly off and I couldn't see it.  Also, the power cells in my range finder went completely dead.  The car was off but it started when I turned the key and I went home to tell my wife and son about what I saw.  I thought I  would report this as I has bothered me all night and have not gotten any sleep.  Has anybody else seen something like this?;44.4452;-90.9356
