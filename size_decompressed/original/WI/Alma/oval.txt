white/silver, oval, high altitude high rate of speed;2000-10-21 09:30:00;15seconds;white/silver, oval, high altitude high rate of speed While spending a bright blue, clear, warmfor Wisconsin fall day on the water I took a few moments to soak in the morning sun. I was lying flat on my back looking up hoping to spot some migratory waterfowl. Instead I saw a bright white/silver oval shaped object surrounded by a blurry haze. It almost seemed as if the haze surrounding the object was moving or flapping. At this point I jumped up to my feet and while pointing I said to my buddy, who was in the front of the boat What the #### is that. I immediately pointed out the fact that what ever it was it was not leaving a contrail and was moving at a rate of speed faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen. I could not judge the height but I believe it to be at about the height at which one would typically see a commercial jet. The object was moving away from my location towards the north. I watched it until it was to small to see. It did not disappear from moving over the horizon it seemed to disappear from gaining altitude. I do not know what it was but I do know it is definitely unidentified!;44.4301;-91.8069
