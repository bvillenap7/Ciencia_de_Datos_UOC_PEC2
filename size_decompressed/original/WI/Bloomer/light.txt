Moving lights  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Venus or Jupiter, we suspect.  PD));2004-06-05 22:30:00;about an hour;Moving lights I went outside to look at the stars, as the night was cloudless at the time. I looked due west from my backyard and saw a really bright light. I thought it was a star, but I watched it move erratically. It kind of moved sideways really fast, then it would stop, then go diagonally. It got really bright, then dimmed, then disappeared. I then turned around to look toward the east. There was a reddish pink light moving slowly up the sky. I watched it moved, then go in little circles, then move again. It would brighten then dim then brighten. I was not sure what it was. I watched it for a while then got my hubby to come look. He tried to prove it was Mars or Jupiter but the position was wrong for all the planets at this time of year. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Venus or Jupiter, we suspect.  PD));45.1012;-91.491
