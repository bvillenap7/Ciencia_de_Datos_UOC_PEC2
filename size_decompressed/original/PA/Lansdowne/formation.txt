Getting out of my vehicle in the driveway, I looked up to the sky to see really high up, as in rocket height, 4-5 silver specs flying at a great speed in formation.  I have witnessed Blue Angel and Thunderbird air shows. It wasn't them as I looked up fly overs for both of them.  They were flying so fast  I knew I didn't have time to grab binoculars to try and focus on what they were.  It was a clear blue sky..no clouds.  No sound coming from them, no trails left behind them. They were so high up beyond what normal planes fly, that you would have needed binoculars or telescope to see what it possibly could have been, especially at the rate of speed they were flying.  Also  flew with constant shifting of formation - quick maneuvering shifting the whole time while in formation. One wouldn't go way out and come back in that formation...they were in formation moving around.  I couldn't see any lights, because of the distance, plus it was daylight. I enjoy aeronau! tics, and this was the 1st time I ever saw anything I didn't really know what it was flying over at a great speed. It was so far up, that my camera would have only picked up specs in the sky, it wouldn't have shown anything substantial. Maybe our military has something in the works and they were practicing something...I don't know.  I never saw anything of the sort flying that high with that speed.;39.9361;-75.2625
