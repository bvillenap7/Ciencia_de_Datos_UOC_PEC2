6-8 orange lights moving over Millersville PA.;2013-02-16 20:30:00;1-3 minutes;6-8 Orange lights moving over Millersville PA. Sitting at my computer desk facing north I looked out the window and saw 6-8 orange lights moving from approx NNW to SSE.   I quickly got up an called out to my family and went outside with them and proceeded to watch the objects continuing to move in a SSE direction until we could no longer see them.   There was no consistent pattern in how they were moving across the sky as they seemed to move about.  I listened to hear if I could hear any sound but there was none.
