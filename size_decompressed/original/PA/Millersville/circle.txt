Three objects flying over Millersville, Pa.;2008-03-03 21:15:00;3 seconds;Three objects flying over Millersville, Pa. I was laying in the quad of my college's campus, looking at stars with a girl (the witness). She pointed out the three objects to me and said Look a shooting star. I looked and saw three objects flying in a single straight line path. The three objects had an orange aura around them. The objects were an equal distance apart and they were all traveling at the same velocity.;39.9999;-76.3612
