Three strange lights dancing in the distance.;2013-11-29 18:30:00;00:10;Three strange lights dancing in the distance. I saw 3 strange lights that looked like stars but I could tell they were much too close for stars.  I decided to drive to a more open area, a golf course, and watched them.  They seemed to leave small trails as they moved, like a comet and as soon as they stopped the trail disappeared.  They moved and passed by each other.  I watched for about 10 minutes until me and the passenger decided to go home.  The background was totally black, clear sky.  They looked almost like a cell phone tower height from afar.  At first I thought that's what it was a tower I never noticed until they began to move and they never blinked.
