Military aircraft and a UFo flying close by.;2005-06-19 14:00:00;2 minutes;Military aircraft and a UFo flying close by. Three chinooks were flying overhead pretty close to the ground. I took pictures of the chinooks with my camera and in the one picture there is another object flying above the chinooks that is in a cone shape. When zoomed into you can see the object pretty good. It was a cloudy day but the object seemed to be out of the clouds in the first picture and in the second picture that was taken immediatly after the object was below the chinooks but less identifiable. The pictures were taken with a digital camera.;41.6568;-76.8596
