My friend and I were walking home from the store up the road when I noticed a blue light in the sky.  As I watched them, a second light appeared.  They would zigzag at a rapid rate, and then stop, and then zig zag again.  I asked my friend did you see that? and he replied well i wasn't gonna say anthing and look stupid!.  So we looked up again and watched and they just zoomed away and a very rapid speed.  The next day it was in the papers about things being seen in the sky that night.  There was a meteor shower, but meteors don't act like that!!  Id have to say that our backgrounds are that we are very sane people, who do have good imaginations, but, man, this was so real.;41.6568;-76.8596
