Bright lights on black hovering craft (250ft in air);2019-06-01 17:00:00;20 seconds;Bright lights on black hovering craft (250ft in air) I was driving home from Pittsburgh on I-79S near the Bridgeville exit when this hovering aircraft appeared from thin air to the left side of the highway above a small hillside. It was only visible when I was almost directly below it,  I did not see it in the distance seconds earlier when I was closer to TopGolf coming down the hill. It was like a rounded rectangle in shape, about the size of 5-6 cars, black on the underside, with 4 circular markings on the bottom. It had multiple bright lights on the underside as well, some of them were larger in size and bright white while the rest were small red lights outlining the craft. At first it was hovering slowly, about 250ft above the hillside, then it gradually rose up to the sky at which point I told my passenger to look, and then it was so far away that is disappeared.;40.3472;-80.1153
