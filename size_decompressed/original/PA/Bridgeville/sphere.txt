Slow moving sphere over Pittsburgh area;2020-05-24 07:15:00;5 minutes;Slow moving sphere over Pittsburgh area Looked out my window and noticed something in the sky. My immediate thought was a balloon slowly rising or just stuck in the wind. Looking closer it was very spherical and would have to be a huge balloon. It started drifting to my left (looking up from Bridgeville PA) and slowly away, generally heading NW towards Pittsburgh Airport. It moved very slowly and faded into the distance. I'm certain it wasn't a helicopter or plane. Only possibilities in my mind are UFO or a drone.  As it went into the distance it lit up a few times. I really believe it was just reflecting early morning sun rays as it moved. Still, that happened as it drifted further away, so it *had* to be pretty sizable to make that kind of reflection. The reflection itself was very bright. Not as in lighting up the sky, just the object itself lit up, like metal reflecting sunlight. If this was a drone, it had to have been very large.  I tried taking video with my phone through my window and screen, which didn't work. The object was too far at that point to pick up on my phone camera.  I've been watching the sky now for about 30 minutes and see nothing. Perhaps you will receive other reports from the Pittsburgh area today.;40.3472;-80.1153
