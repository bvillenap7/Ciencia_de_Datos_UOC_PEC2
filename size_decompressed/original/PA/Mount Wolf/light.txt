At 22:10 a fourth appeared, the four then began to fly in what appeared to be a predetermined pattern in which they came together and flew apart changing every second sequence.  They did this for approximately 20 minutes, then as they flew apart they flew up and disappeared.  The sky was cloudy and the best description I could give of them is that they looked disk shapped with the brightest portion as a line in the center.  I did photograph the four of them and hope to have some good pictures to share.  It was amazing.;40.0756;-76.6914
