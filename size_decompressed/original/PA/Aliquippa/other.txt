colorful lighted bowl shaped object landed in back yard early morning.;1976-06-01 06:00:00;5 minutes;colorful lighted bowl shaped object landed in back yard early morning. Third party account of elderly woman (grandmother) who was healthy and in her 70's at the time.  She ventured outside to get some lettuce from her garden at 102 Norman  Street, Aliquippa, PA and saw a colorful and brilliantly lit craft in the back yard about the size of a tent.  She described it as an upside down bowl with brilliant lights that looked like a bouquet of flowers.  She was scared, and woke her husband up who witnessed the same object through the bedroom window.  Upon going outside to investigate further, the object was gone.  There was no physical evidence of any object on the lawn from what I recall.;40.5908;-80.3155000000001
