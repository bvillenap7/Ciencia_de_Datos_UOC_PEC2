At approximately 2:00 pm eastern standard time on 5/6/2011, I was in my back yard.  I looked up, and saw a black, triangular shaped object flying from south to north.  It was not a perfect triangle, as the rear part of the object sloped in toward the center, creating the appearance of wings.  The object was very similar in appearance to images I have seen of the B-1 bomber in silhouette.  There was some cloud cover, and the object remained visible as it passed beneath the clouds.  Its size appeared to be slightly larger than an average propeller driven airplane.  It was  completely silent, and moved at a rapid steady rate in a straight path until it passed out of my view.;41.2516;-76.0905

I have a lake in the front of my house and after the lake there is mountain.   So I look at this object and notice that it was not blinking and I could also notice that there was an outline of the object.  And I got a little frightened because I knew it was not a plane.  And I watched this object fly towards the mountain behind my lake.  It was moving faster then a plane or a helicopter could, and it was moving straight.  So I was watching this object and it disappeared behind the mountain.  And I was basically done with my cigarette when the object reappeared from the mountain and I was startled because it was going completely straight when it did a right turn and I was really confused.  It then just disappeared.;41.2516;-76.0905
