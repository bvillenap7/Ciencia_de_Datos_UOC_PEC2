Low flying rectangular object with very bright lights on all sides.;1995-10-01 18:30:00;10 minutes;Low flying rectangular object with very bright lights on all sides. My friend and I were travling west on Route 22 towards Altoona PA. We saw a large object in the sky moving slowly.  It was travling north from the Williamsburg area.  I stopped the car along the side of the road east of Short Mountian.  The object was rectangular in shape and had very bright light coming from all sides.  It was black and flew very slow just over the tree tops. We watched it fly over my car. We saw it through the moon roof in my car.  Nobody believes we saw this object.  We were going to see a movie in Altoona and were not drunk or on drugs.  We did not see any beings or space men.  I looked at all of the local news papers and none of them had any thing on this event. We did not hear any noise coming from this object.;40.399;-78.2548
