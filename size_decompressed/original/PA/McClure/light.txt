The object at first appeared to be an awfully bright star. While taking my dog out before putting her to bed I witnessed the object 45° in the sky at nearly perfect northwest. Nearly camouflaged as a star the object would dip down, rise up, and seemingly bounce back and forth within a relatively small radius from where I first noticed it. The lights coming from it were brighter than any other light in the sky, but not too much brighter than the brightest star. The nature of the light however was strange and had an LED like glow. It appeared at moments to be looking in various directions which I judged by seeing the light shine around. The color of the light was lighter and whiter than the stars in the sky but appeared to change between a VERY faint red and green tint. We watched the object for a period of 15 minutes before deciding to head inside as the object didn’t appear to be going anywhere. It appeared to be observing or searching for something. Picture! s don’t seem feasible as it was simply too far away and any still shot would look like a star, and I don’t have the video equipment to take a video that could clearly show the object and its movements.;40.7002;-77.3772
