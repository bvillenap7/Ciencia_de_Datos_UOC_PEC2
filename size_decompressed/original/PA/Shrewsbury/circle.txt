Circular orangish-yellow lights with comet like tails flying in a line,one behind the other, from west to east in the Northern sky.;1999-11-16 19:07:00;60 seconds;Circular orangish-yellow lights with comet like tails flying in a line,one behind the other, from west to east in the Northern sky. Seven to nine orange-yellow fire like balls were seen moving low from west to east across the northern sky.  I had just arrived home from work (I am a practicing Doctor of Chiropractic in Baltimore and travelled straight home after office hours). I was standing on my front porch.  I was totally sober and do not need sight corrective glasses.  The objects moved rapidly...about the speed of fast, low flying fighter jets.  They caught my eye because of the straight line formation that they maintained and the number of them. I originally thought that they may be jets but the comet like tails did not apply...jets don't have a highly visible tail at night and do not appear as an orange ball of fire. The comet-like tails dissipated into a shower of small sparks.  The largest was in front with smaller objects following.  All travelled in a straight, level line. They all began to disappear at the same time when they reached the north-east sky leaving a twinkling of sparks behind for approximately 1 second after the disappearance of the round objects which then slowly faded away.  This occurred during the Leonid meteor shower period but was unlike any falling star that I have ever seen.  The size, color, speed, formation, number, and sparking tail did not fit the appearance of a falling star (a falling star appeared within 20 seconds of the occurrence but was of a silver appearance, was much smaller in size, fell from overhead to the horizon in the north east sky, and disappeared as it approached the horizon).;39.7617;-76.6715

It was moving in a south to southwest direction very slowly.  It was visible for approximately two to three minutes and then vanished.  There was no sound, no wind and the sky was very clear.  It seemed to be only 500 feet above the ground.  It did appear to have a horizontal line through it extending behind it.;39.7617;-76.6715
