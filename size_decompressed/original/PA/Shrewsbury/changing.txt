Just southeast of the moon (following a straight diagonal line)in the eastern sky near the horizon (at the tops of trees) a large orange/blue/purple (changing) oval shaped craft(?) hovered several seconds (while changing), then seemed to descend slightly behind trees, then came up again - all the while in this strange shape and ever-changing colors, orange being the most prominent.  The only way to accuarately describe it's predominant shape was a Conquistador's Helmet.  Also spotted by someone in Glen Burnie, Maryland, some 40 miles away.;39.7617;-76.6715
