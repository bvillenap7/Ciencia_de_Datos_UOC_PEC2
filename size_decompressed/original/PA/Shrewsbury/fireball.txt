I was laying in bed when I saw a large bright light through the corner of my blinds.  I opened my blinds more, and thought the light looked weird, it was bright yellowish like the color of the sun, however it was night time and it was low to the ground no higher than a street light.  I thought it was a streetlight till it started moving, Once I started staring at it as it was swaying around it got bigger and I realized it was coming closer to the window so I went downstairs.  When I came back up it was gone.  There was no noise coming from it.;39.7617;-76.6715
