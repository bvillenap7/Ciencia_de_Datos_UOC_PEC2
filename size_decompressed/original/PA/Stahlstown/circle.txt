Orange, rapidly pulsing orb.;2015-05-26 00:46:00;1 minute (aware);Orange, rapidly pulsing orb Step outside in grass.  Look to the southeast sky through moderately thick clouds, camouflage patterning the sky %90 covered. Moon is down below some trees to my right, only 3 sparse stars are seen.  Immensely bright orange at first, extremely rapid (cannot detect black period) phasing as compared to an electronic, orange candle flickering yet observed motionless.  Size, as represented by an average candle, would compare to that candle being seen at an approx. 10 FEET, IF observing only orange flame.  True size and distance are unknown.  After holding pulsing intensity for 7 seconds, brightness dims to star-like over 1 second changing color to white whilst doing so, motionless.  Without holding at low brightness, color reverts to orange halfway through coming back to initial light intensity in approx. 1 second.  Now, really truly, object ascends at 85 degree angle at the speed of a floating candle while looking like one, weaving cloud mass.  Object is dimming down a b! it during latter third of ascent, getting finally lost behind a SMALL cloud splotch.  Object possibly seen once more in same location behind stagnant cloud displayed at star-like intensity in white color, pulsing.  Total practical distance traveled in sky, 1 foot.  My cat had been gone for hours, appeared to come back in I can't say more than immediately after final sighting.;40.1368;-79.3398
