Bright light shot across the sky in front of us near Conneaut Lake, PA on Rt. 285.;2013-05-26 21:05:00;2 seconds;Bright light shot across the sky in front of us near Conneaut Lake, PA on Rt. 285. It was me, my husband and 12 year old son, in our car, May 26, 2013 around 9:05pm,  driving eastbound on Rt. 285 towards Conneaut Lake when we saw something very bright shoot across the sky in front of us.  The “light” went across the road from right to left.  It was only about, what we can estimate, maybe 500 feet in front of us.  It was also quite big but yet small at the same time. I was driving the speed limit, 55, at the time that we saw it.  I actually sped up so we could get to a clearing in the trees, see where it had gone but whatever it was, it was completely gone!  There was no sound.  There was no visible trail to indicate a meteor.  Clearly, if it had been a plane, which we knew instantly it wasn’t because it was way too fast, we would see it when we hit the clearing. This has completely baffled us and knew we had to tell someone.   Thank you for letting us share.  Hopefully someone else saw the same thing and will report it just like we have.  Please let us know.;41.6218;-80.3062

For the next 6 minutes or so we all watched as 20 orange lights appeared from the northeast heading southwest one after another until they seemingly vanished in the sky.  There was no sound heard from them.   I recorded a little over 5 minutes of this event on my cell phone video camera.;41.6218;-80.3062
