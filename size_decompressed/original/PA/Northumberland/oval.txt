Orange object that changed directions and colors.;2014-11-30 21:45:00;5 minutes;Orange object that changed directions and colors. This is the second time my wife and I saw this object.  We saw it a few nights ago but I didn't have my phone on me.   Tonight, I got a pic and a 2 minute video of the object.  The object was orange in color and changed to red. It glowed bright. It came from the east.    The object stopped in mid flight.  It then moved slightly left and right before going backwards and northeast.;40.9056;-76.7872
