3 Lights in triangle formation all seperate entities Merging with stars;2019-05-25 03:33:00;1 minute;3 Lights in triangle formation all seperate entities Merging with stars I was on my roof top balcony watching the stars its was one of the clearest nights ive ever seen this spring so far..  The moon as huge and bright to the left was a star and to the right a even brighter star further out..  After seeing the same sky for about 20 minutes i looked down to check my phone.  As i glance back up i noticed a formation of stars that were not there moments earlier.. I couldnt believe my eyes.  It was a in formation of a triangle but looked exactly like the rest of stars. as i began thinking what it could be one of the 3 lights started to disappear then the next and then the next .  I stood for 35 min in awww only to not see the formation show again.  One thing weird i noticed is in that window of me watching the stars i never witnessed a single place.  But few minutes after the sighting planes started rolling by as normal .  This area had a alien abduction case that was pushed under the rug about a man named Sees ...  My own good friend obe had videos on videos of ufos he captured on the island by the small airport.  One day he took his own life while watching these videos....Since i was 18 ive seen an amazing amount of movement in the skys.. Its weird even the military do patrol flights up here with apaches and other helicopters almost weekly. Something isnt right in this area of PA and i think i need to find answers,,, Ive seen lights come off the local mountain near the old Military armory here in Sunbury Pa..  Orange glowing orbs that start flying slow then zooom into space.  This area since 2000 has been high in sightings i know just from my own events ive witnessed one with 3 witnesses as well .  I have  at least 4 accounts of strange experiences.;40.9056;-76.7872
