One smaller and red, pink or orange colored. Couldn't tell shape. My sister and I walked out of our aunt's house.  I looked to the right and saw this strange flying craft.  It appeared to have a another craft flying close by.  Cloud height.  Pink, orange or red.  Smaller.   The larger craft had a trail behind it and the other was flying in an around the craft and through the trail.  Really couldn't tell the size.   I took a pic of it but only caught the bigger craft.  Sorry it was just crazy to see so I never thought to get out my phone until it was some distance away.   The larger craft was shiny.  We thought it might have been the sun's reflection until we noticed other dark planes in the area because of Philadelphia airport's close proximity.   Strangest thing and it's taken me this long to report because I thought someone else would have seen it.  It was in plain view.  Startling.  The larger craft wasn't what made the sighting weird.   The smaller craft flying around it at different angles an speeds made it different.  We passed it off as! a drone.;39.9196894736842;-75.398252631579
