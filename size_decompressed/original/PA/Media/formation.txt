At approximately 4:00 some coworkers and I spotted what we thought was a police helicopter hovering with red and blue or red and green lights. Then we looked around where we sighted the first one initially and others began to appear. There were two that were above what we initially thought was a triangle formation. The two above the others were moving up and down but seemed to be stationed in the same location. All began to flicker and we witnessed one in particular move horizontally, flash then flicker out. We then witnessed three form a vertical line on the right side of the triangle formation. We were astounded because there appeared to be many more than we originally thought. We   got weirded out and left the area. Amazing spectacle.;39.9196894736842;-75.398252631579
