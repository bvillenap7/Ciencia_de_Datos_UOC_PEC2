Meteor like object falling to earth very slowly in midaftenoon.;2005-12-08 13:00:00;4 hours;Meteor like object falling to earth very slowly in midaftenoon. It was clearly visible during midafternoon in a west/southwesterly direction.  It looked like a meteor or other falling object from space, it had a tail which extended straight up as if it were falling. I first sited it at exactly 1:00, and it was still visible at 4:00 pm eastern and appeared have moved a relatively small distance down. it was off white in color compared to the pure white of a nearby air plain trail.  The object was hard to distinguish from the tail but appeared to be irregularly or oblong in shape, not spherical.  The tail was approximatly 11 times longer than the object itself.;39.9196894736842;-75.398252631579
