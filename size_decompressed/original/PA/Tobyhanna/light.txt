Red light in the Sky;2004-12-26 23:10:00;5 Seconds;Red light in the Sky I was smoking a cigarette on my back deck, looking toward my back yard which is faily woodland (but not dense).  Then all of a sudden in the background, I seen a Red Light that seemed to appear from behind the house in back of me (past my lot).  It didnt come from that house, but a fair distance away.  The red light rose at a pretty fast pace (but not extremely fast) almost a perfect line, but wiggled a little bit from side to side (not drastic).  It looked like it left a small trail from its path, but it was snowing out, so cant say for certain.  Then all of a sudden it stopped in mid air for a second, then it was gone.  I didnt see it after that second, because I turned around to open the door and yell to my parents.  It left In my words a red circle where it did stop for around i would say 10 seconds then the red circle Trail disapated.  I thought after scrutenizing my sighting that it might have been a firework, or maybe a flare.  We do have a small airport where we are, but not near the direction where I was looking (North).  It did not make a sound, no explosion, nothing like a firework makes.  And if I remember, aeronatical flares stay lit for much longer than what I have seen.  It was very spooky!  I had goose bumps all over my body.  If anybody seen this light at the same time I did, leave a post.  It might have been a flare, but it didnt Feel like one.  And it definetly wasnt a small airplane, no flashing lights, no noise and it was much to bright.  Any information regarding this sighting would be very useful and put me at ease.;41.1849000000001;-75.3860000000002
Lighted object in the SW sky, looked like a star but moved southward and slowly faded out. Then moved north 10 minutes later.;2013-07-26 21:15:00;15 minutes;Lighted object in the SW sky, looked like a star but moved southward and slowly faded out. Then moved north 10 minutes later. Since it's nighttime, all I was legitimately able to see was a round light. Almost identical to the star next to it.   It basically looked just like a star in the night, but moved south and slowly disappeared.  The light faded to complete darkness over about a 7 second duration.  About 10 minutes later, another light object (possibly the same one) moved back north from the same area that the other one disappeared at.  But the brightness of the light was only about half as bright this time.  Both objects moved in a straight line, but were definitely not planes because of how high up they were. And the lighted objects were 1 solid bright color the whole time.  No blinking or anything.  The location of these objects were almost directly from looking straight up into the sky, but to the south-west a bit.  I mention 15 minute duration because of the difference in time between the first and second objects.  My first time witnessing anything like this before, and i'll admit it shocked me a bit.;41.1849000000001;-75.3860000000002
Definite UFO just seen.;2017-08-15 20:40:00;7 minutes;Definite UFO just seen. I live out here in the mountains (2000 feet up) , so it's perfect for night viewing and there's always interesting stuff out here it seems.   I've seen meteors burn up several times.. but this was no meteor. It was a lighted object , just as faint as some of the stars out there.  But it was moving.   I couldn't believe my eyes at first, because it literally looked THAT far away, like it was one of the stars that are hundreds of light years away, But was moving from due south to due north.  and then out of view.   I got my cell-phone but the light from it was faint, and wouldn't even come into view on there.  It was definitely not a meteor or asteroid because it moved in a straight line from south to north and never was there any fainting of the the solid light.  It was of the same solid color  (white or yellow) the whole time.  No blinking or blinking lights of any kind either.   Planes fly through here all the time, and this was no plane from this planet.    It honestly just looked like an orb of light moving from south to north....but it was VERY far away it seemed.  The light on the object may of been from the sun setting as well, as the sun set like an hour (or more) ago , but up that high, I could see how the sun could reflect things from that angle.  There was also no sound.  This was amazing and my first official UFO sighting. You can email me back if any questions, but otherwise I prefer to remain anon.;41.1849000000001;-75.3860000000002
