Two round bright lights right next to each other brighter than all the satrs around.  I asked my boyfriend if he saw them too and he did.   You have to think I live basically on a mountain and we were in the valley before my home about to drive up the mountain, these lights were up way higher than any of the trees on the top near my house.   Once we get to the top it's all fields and trees, we looked around the sky everywhere and by now the lights should have been right above us from where we first saw them a mere 4 minutes before, and they were gone, just disappeared without a trace .;40.9419;-79.4499
