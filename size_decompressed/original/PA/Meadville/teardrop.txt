shiny metalic double teardrop shape, silent fast in a clear sky;1998-06-16 14:00:00;seconds;shiny metalic double teardrop shape, silent fast in a clear sky This object has been observed on 3 occasions in the past month, on clear sunny days in the afternoon. It has been seen by a man and his wife and son. He took a photo of it which is attached. He wishes to be anonymous but gave me permission to report these sightings. He described it as very shiny bright metalic in color. The shape was like an hourglass on its side. It moved very fast in a straight line and was only seen for 5-10 seconds each time. One time there was a helicopter in the area. The sightings were in Meadville, PA. There was no sound or trail associated with this object. I would be interested if anyone else has seen a similar object.;41.6323000000001;-80.1472000000001
