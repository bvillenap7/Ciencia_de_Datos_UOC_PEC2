We were enjoying a backyard campfire at the time. I own a carpet cleaning business in meadville, Pa.  My son who was visiting with his family for the holiday has a degree in marketing and works in that field.  I first observed the light moving across and downward.  It was the magnitude of a large star.  The light was constant and consistent as it moved.  I brought it to the attention of my son.  At that moment the object appeared to turn downward and grew very bright .  I could only describe it as a super flood light. It hovered there for a few seconds and the light dimmed down and almost out as if it were turned down by a rheostat switch.  The object pulled back out and upward at a sharp angle.  Ot had a dim light and went out. We disussed the possibilities and concluded that what we saw was intelligently maneuvered and the light was artificial.;41.6323000000001;-80.1472000000001

The lights were in a vertical shape.  The lights were like a giantic floodlight and very bright.  The lights were hovering over power lines between Route 86 and Ryan Road.  The middle light was offcenter.  The lights appeared over a wooded area or a field.;41.6323000000001;-80.1472000000001
At least six soundless, orange, glowing balls of light floating past and disappearing without a sound.;2010-04-18 00:05:00;10 mins;At least six soundless, orange, glowing balls of light floating past and disappearing without a sound. Just around midnight on 04/18/10, my fiance heard a lot of loud talking outside.  We live in a college neighborhood, so at first he assumed it was some kids partying. However, after about 20 minutes, he decided to go outside and see what was going on.  That is when he realized that there were four or more people standing on the sidewalk watching the sky.  He looked up and saw several glowing orbs of light very low in the sky floating slowly past.  At this time, he woke me up as well and I was able to witness the same thing.  From the time I got outside, we saw six of these floating lights.  Each of them were equally distanced apart, flying the exact same route, and they all disappeared in the same spot of the sky.   This was a very cloudy night, so even stars were not visible.   There was no sound coming from the objects and they seemed to be very close to us.  We did not speak to the other witnesses, so we cannot be sure how long it was going on for before we! got outside, or how many had flown past in total.
