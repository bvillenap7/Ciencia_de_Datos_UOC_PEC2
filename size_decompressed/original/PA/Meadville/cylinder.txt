Strange Lights Over Small Pennsylvania Town.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of celestial bodies.  PD));2006-11-22 06:09:00;90 Min.;Strange Lights Over Small Pennsylvania Town My 2 children and I saw some type of aircraft over the city where we live.  One craft was larger than the other ones.  The larger craft looked as though it was a pulsing light, it went from blue to white to yellow to orange to red. The other other 3 smaller crafts stayed the color red. The smaller ones were quite a distance away from the larger one. 2 were side by side and the other small one was below the other 2.  All these crafts stayed in one spot they just seemed to be hovering there and as day break came the smaller ones seemed to disappear, but the larger one stayed visible then it was gone in a blink of an eye.  We didn't go outside so I don't know if there were any noises coming from these lights or not.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Sirius.  HOAX.  PD));41.6323000000001;-80.1472000000001
