Somebody purposely blew up something out in space, beyond our atmosphere.  I was watching the tiniest of dot crossing the sky when all of a sudden there was an explosion where the dot was headed.  Then the tiny dot was going back the way it came, but flashed, very brightly, twice right after the explosion.  It continued in the reverse direction moving faster than when it was headed for the explosion.  Happened all so quickly.  About 1/2 an hour later, from the exact place that the explosion was, I saw a falling star.  This very bright object was bright for about an inch (thumb at arms length), was blank for about two inches, then bright again for about 6 inches before vanishing.  I watched for about two hours longer but didn't see anything else.  I really wish that if anyone else saw this or knows what it was all about, that you would let us know.  It was obvious that something deliberately blew something up, then half hour later the object entered our atmosphere and burned up.  Cool stuff!!;41.6323000000001;-80.1472000000001
