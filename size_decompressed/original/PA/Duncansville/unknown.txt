It disappeared like a tv screen turning off. I opened my back door there was a bright huge light but a dim light in the feild. (Tonight is very dark.) The light shined up in the air. I ran and got my boyfriend. As we observed it we took notice that there was a silouate of an oval shape under the light. After 20 mins of looking at it it all of a sudden turned of as if a tv shut off. We didn't know if it shut off or flew away. I got my camera a took some pictures they are not very good on the camera but you can see the lights reflecting. I also took a video. When I put it on my computer and seen it in a bigger screen it looks like it is covered in tiny lights.. Tomarrow Im going out to the feild to look at where it was (6/7/08).;40.4298;-78.4408
