While standing on my deck, saw the following come across the mountain background:  Redish Pink light, no tail, no strobe or blinking,  moved at signifigant speed traveling northeast, then, changed direction, took a curved turn to head east, then seemed to stop.  Held position for few minutes, then headed at signifigant speed across skyine heading north.  Looked like a bright star at first, til I realized it was moving.  Certainly not any conventional aircraft.  Business executive, age 44.;40.4298;-78.4408
