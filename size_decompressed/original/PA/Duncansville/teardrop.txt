At first we thought it was a helicopter with a spot light but it when up very very fast, at this point it looked like two lights flashing very fast.  One was red and one was orange but it looked almost like fire cause they were flashing very fast and took up the size of the flying object.  At this time it started flying North East and we noticed it had no wings and it never made a sound, it wasn't completely round but was round in shape but elongated at the tail end.  Then the lights went out and it was just a black object in the sky, and then it just disappeared.   The whole thing lasted about 4 mins, and a minute of that it was flying with no lights.  The strangest thing is I was trying to film it with my phone but my phone would not record.  This might be cause of operator error but I kept hitting the button but it wouldn't start recording till it disappeared.;40.4298;-78.4408
