No sharp turns or flashing lights were noted. It looked like the moon in a total eclipse.  There was a  slight glow of white light eminating from around the circular edge. It was about 2/3's the size of the moon.  This particular night the moon was on the rise and in a slight crescent phase.  I called out to my husband what I was seeing at the time.  He couldn't see it with the naked eye.  It left my field of vision in about 5 seconds since we were lying out between two fields of trees.;41.8656;-76.2976
