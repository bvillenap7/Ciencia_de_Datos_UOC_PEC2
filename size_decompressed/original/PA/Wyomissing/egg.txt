Blue Craft Traveling at an Extremely High Rate of Speed w/ Zero Sound;2013-06-08 23:45:00;10 seconds;Blue Craft Traveling at an Extremely High Rate of Speed w/ Zero Sound A friend and I both observed a blue craft with a slight yellow hue on the outside of the craft. The craft morphed within a 1-2 mile distance from where we were standing outside.  It appeared mid sky and then traveled at an extremely high rate of speed (500+mph) at a 45' degree angle.  It happened at 11:45 pm Saturday June 8th 2013.  For being as close as it was to us, it produced zero sound.;40.3356;-75.979
