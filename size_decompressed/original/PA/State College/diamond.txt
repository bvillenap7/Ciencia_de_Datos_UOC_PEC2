6 Diamond shaped crafts with lights that flashed from red to blue to white on each tip.;2005-01-27 20:00:00;40 min.;6 Diamond shaped crafts with lights that flashed from red to blue to white on each tip. On 01/27/2005 around 8:00pm, I just got back from my local video game store, while getting out of the car, I saw these odd lights in the sky that were flashing and moving around.  At the time there were only two crafts that I saw.  They would fly in this odd pattern, one craft would would fly above the other one, the bottom one would stop and the top would stop.  Then the top craft would fly off.  After viewing this I thought they were some type of military aircraft and went inside.  I saw my brother going outside to look when he called me to come out to see that there were many more crafts, a total of 6.  All of the crafts had flashing lights that were red, blue, and white. I found there was no sound from them at all.  One flew directly over me and I saw it was a diamond shape and the red lights were on each tip.  They couldn't have been airplanes because they were flying so close together at times.  After the crafts would fly in seperate paths, they would all come together into a triangle formation then split back up again.  Some of the crafts would be flying at the same speed of the others, and then speed up very very fast.  I went insde and got a digital camera to try to take a picture, but when I tryed to put them on my computer, it said there were no pictures on the camera.  I found this to be very strange because that never happened to me before.  The crafts continued to fly for 30 minutes before they all disappeared.  On the night my brother and I saw them, it was a very clear night, there were no clouds at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD));40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
