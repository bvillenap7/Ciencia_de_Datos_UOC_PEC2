We we're on a trip up to my girlfriends apartment from altoona to state college. I saw a triangle light form, that was blinking in harmony, like some sort of beacon and in the distance was a ship of some sort with 3 red lights and blue lights going as it appeared in a circular fashion around the ship.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
Large, transparent triangle moving southwest to northeast across the night sky.;2018-02-27 21:30:00;~30-45 seconds;Large, transparent triangle moving southwest to northeast across the night sky. During stargazing, we noticed a large, triangular shaped “transparency” moving across the sky--approximately southwest to northwest.  It moved rather quickly for its size (about the time it would take to watch an airplane go across the sky).  The size was that of about 15-20 airplanes (as seen from the ground) clustered into a triangle.  The shape moved very steadily without zigzagging or changing speeds.  The shape was very obvious and visible, yet the object looked essentially transparent. Truly the oddest thing I’ve ever seen.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
