At around 10 pm I took the dog out for her daily constitutional.  I began to look at the stars, it being a clear evening (a rarity in central Pennsylvania). Almost immediately noticed a bright light traveling very slowly from west to east. The light was circular, very bright (shimmering) and was considerably larger than aircraft lights (at least 5 times as large).  I observed the light for several seconds (I'm only guessing that it was 5 seconds) until it just vanished. Again, it was a clear evening so clouds were not a factor. I suppose this light could have been a meteor (although it was moving very slowly, and there was no tail).  I feel pretty sure, though that this object was not man made. Lastly, I'd also be very surprised if others did not see this object as well.  Several conventional aircraft were visible in the area shortly after the event so I'm tempted to call the airport to see if they heard anything about it. On the other hand I don't want to sound like a nut :-);40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698

Single handedly the weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
