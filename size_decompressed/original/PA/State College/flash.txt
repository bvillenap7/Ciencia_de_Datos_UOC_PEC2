Bright flash, long and slow disipation of a thick white trail;1997-05-01 22:00:00;20 seconds;Bright flash, long and slow disipation of a thick white trail It was one minor/strange sighting. I just remember my friend and I being outside (this happened about 5 years ago) and there was a big white flash in the sky, definitely not lighting, so we looked up and immediately saw a giant white streak go across the sky. Unlike a shooting star, the tail remained and slowly faded away. There was the flash, a shooting and then the thick and bright white tail that lasted a good 10-15 seconds before disappearing. We didn't really see any particular shape, but it was definitely not lighting followed by an asteroid. It was much larger and slower than something burning up in the atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Twenty seconds' duration would probably rule out, we believe, virtually all meteors.  We will ask the witness to attempt to establish the exact date for the incident.  PD));40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
Silver lines/flashes in the sky.;2008-04-16 13:00:00;at least 15 minutes;Silver lines/flashes in the sky. I was driving along the highway and looked up in the blue, party cloudy sky and noticed a sudden flash of silver in the sky.  As soon as I looked again for it, it would disappear.  I thought it was a plane, but noticed it again and it was in the same spot. Then it kept flashing (flipping) as the sun reflected on it. The flashes would last a slight second and disappear again. It looked like a small silver line. Then I noticed a second one nearby. Made it to work and told some co-workers. They said they saw the same flashes, but as they went to look directly at it, it was gone.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
Stationary blinking light;2010-05-09 21:00:00;over an hour;Stationary blinking light At about 9:30 pm this evening (5/9/10) I looked up and noticed a white light blink on an off (quickly). I continued my star gazing and noticed the same blinking light in the exact same place about a minute later.  I've seen satalites, the I.S.S. etc passing over and I've even noticed occasional flashes of increased light from these which I assume is related to the rotation of mirrors or something catching the sun's rays.  This incident is different.  I continued to watch the light blink on and off every minute or a bit longer continually for an hour, and always in the exact same spot in the clear nite sky.  I imagine it's still doing so even as I write this.  Can you tell me if there is any type of natural or man made phenominon that can occur in this fashion?  It's got me curious as all get out!;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
