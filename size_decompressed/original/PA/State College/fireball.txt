This ball travelled in a straight Horizontal line across the sky in an easterly direction. It progressively left a tail of sparks and smaller balls of white light behind it--totalling five--until it left our sight, the sparks nor the balls at any time fell towards the ground but instead stayed in the sky and appeared to burn out as they moved farther away. We observed the incident for 30 seconds or more.  There did not appear to be any overhead electrical lines or aircraft in the area.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698

I watched it for a minute and noticed that it wasn't moving in a steady direction.  I thought maybe the fiery look was a combination of different flashing lights but as it got closer and more directly above me it was close enough that I could see this was not the case.  I couldn't make out any silhouette.  I called my brother and we both went outside and observe it object make a slow arc across town but not in a way that helicopters or planes normally fly.  The speed was sporadic and it didn't move in a straight line.  It eventually moved away and ascended so that I could barely make out the light except for what might be confused as a colored star or planet.

This evening at about 9:30PM EST saw an orange light that at first appeared like a small plane on fire.  After about 30 second of viewing it, it was almost overhead.  Then some parts broke away and burned out.  The orange fire looking piece continued moving from north toward the south about the speed of a small plane. As it continued to move along it started to dim.  It seemed to start to dim so much that it was ending its light.  But, we got into our car and left. We saw this as we were coming out of a restaurant in State College, PA, and going to our car in the parking lot.  Thought it was a kind of flare, but it appeared to be very high and was moving at a slow speed across the sky.  Speed of a small plane.

Bright orange fireball circles around house five times on same, slow path for 15 minutes.;2014-07-13 22:50:00;15 minutes;Bright orange fireball circles around house five times on same, slow path for 15 minutes. At around 10:50 PM I saw from my second story bedroom windows a bright orange fireball like object moving in a slow, steady path from the West to the East.  I often see various lights from airplanes that are much smaller and moving at a much faster pace, so I paid closer attention and watched it until I lost sight of it.   I continued to look out my window and then about a couple of minutes later it came around following the same steady path again.  At first glance it appeared to look almost like a chinese lantern, but at a closer look it appeared to be too bright as it emitted beams of light.   It also had a small bright light trailing behind it.  It made no sound.  I waited and it went around a third time before I went downstairs to show my mom. Because our house has many windows, we could easily see it for a long expanse.   When it disappeared from our view, weâ€™d wait a couple of minutes and then we saw it come around twice more.  We witnessed it circling a total of five times and then did not see it again.  The total duration of the sighting was approximately fifteen minutes.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
