Seen UFO with my son and 12 ON DUTY State College cops!;2009-07-02 04:30:00;90 minutes;Seen UFO with my son and 12 ON DUTY State College cops! On the Morning of July Second, 2009,  My son and I witnessed a orange spherical UFO with 12 on duty State College, PA police officers!  I call.  And one officer showed up.  And one after another, they were calling their fellow officers here to my house to witness this UFO! They were freaking out cause they were scared!  They all got a lot of pics!  I did not!  I was freaked cause I had witnesses, not the first or last time I have seen a UFO. I've contacted Coast to Coast AM, Jaime Fox and MUFON.  It seems no one believes my story. I never heard of that many cops in one location witnessing a UFO and I want my story known. This is NOT a hoax and this did happen!  If you want to contact me, feel free to and I can fill you in on more details!  You have my email address.  My phone # is 814-((number deleted)).;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
