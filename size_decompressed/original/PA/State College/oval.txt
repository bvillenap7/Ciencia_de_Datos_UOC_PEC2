2 oval/egg shaped objects sped overhead with no sound;2001-02-03 18:00:00;1 minutes or less;2 oval/egg shaped objects sped overhead with no sound My grandfather and I were walking home from church around dusk.  2 bright oval objects caught our attention above the tree line.  We thought at first it was an aircraft from the local airport (approx. 5 miles away).  But, because of the tremendous acceleration of the objects, we knew that it could not be an airplane.  As the objects passed almost directly above us, we heard no sound at all, even though they were travelling at a high rate of speed.  As they sped away, they seemed to change direction very abruptly.  The weather was overcast, so we could not maintain visual contact for very long.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
