Line of 10-15 lights west of State College moving south.;2016-01-05 21:30:00;1 minute;Line of 10 to 15 lights west of State College moving south. Relatively clear night with a few thin clouds, can see many stars and a couple airplanes. Was looking northwest when I first noticed the lights (didn't see them appear).  They moved toward the south and I was able to see them clearly, until I lost them behind some trees and a building.  At that point I was looking a little south of due west.  They were brighter than the stars but not as bright/crisp as airplane lights. Long line of white lights moving south, parallel to and about 30 degrees above the horizon.  Direction of motion appeared to be along the axis of the line.  Very straight line, very steady lights.  None moved relative to one another, and all were evenly spaced.  Did not appear to be getting closer or farther away--the line maintained a steady length.  Did not appear to accelerate. Not sure how to describe scale, but from my perspective the line appeared to be about the length from Orion's belt to his front foot.  (The lights didn't cross Orion, but it was an easy reference.);40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
