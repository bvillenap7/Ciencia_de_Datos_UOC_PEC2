lights in the sky;2002-05-05 22:00:00;3-4 mins;lights in the sky I've been watching these lights in the sky for the past 5-6 years now. The first time i noticed them I was just watching the night sky when I noticed this light moving across the sky it looked like a star. They get bright and they fade, they appear to go around stars, Some times they appear to wobble. Anyways the first one i was watching kept going back and forth from one mountain ridge to the other till all of a sudden another one came and met up with the one i'd been watching and they flew off together side by side.   I've also seen them going across the sky and stop and go straight up and dissapear. I've seen one go across the sky and had fire or some kind of bright flash then dissapear. I can't get them in veiw with a telescope they're to fast i've tried binocculars they're just brighter lights. I've tried to get somebody to come out to see these lights from the university here but no one seemed interested. When I came acrossed this website I could'nt believe how many others are seeing the same thing or what appears to be the same thing. I am really interested in finding out what they are.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
Light that zigzaged across the sky and dissapeared;2004-09-18 22:30:00;5 seconds;Light that zigzaged across the sky and dissapeared In the west sky.. i pointed out what i thought was a shooting star. I had enough time to point it out and let my boyfriend see it also.  Then it suddently changed directions and zig zaged around the sky and suddenly dissapeared in the north sky.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
We saw a bright light that reached intense speeds and had abrupt stops.;2004-09-21 22:00:00;5 minutes;We saw a bright light that reached intense speeds and had abrupt stops. I was sitting in my house playing Halo for xbox.  My father called to help him take out the garbage.  My father was talking and then stopped in mid sentence and pointed to the mountain.  I looked up and saw a mysterous light.   It began to dart from one end of the mountain range to the other and would dissapear and then reapear.    Then just as it mysterously apperad it was gone.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
Large spot of light seen next to full moon;2008-07-18 01:07:00;20 minutes and counting;Large spot of light seen next to full moon There is a spot of light in the sky the relative size of a large star, if you are looking at the moon from the North West it is some 15 or 20 degrees to away to the west with you as the point of the angle. It is red and yellow solid light not moving except brief periods when it moves very quickly. It is very small in the night sky but I don't believe it to be a plane, satellite, or helicopter since it is so stationary If the movement is just an optical illusion, then it could be a planet, but it is emitting quite a lot of light because I can see it right next to the full moon.  By the strictest definition, it is a UFO in that I cannot identify this flying object, so it is either an air or space craft, a planet, or a nova, but it does shift from yellow to red periodically and sometimes appears both.  No other stars are visible in the same area.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
Around 12 red lights moving in loose formation over State College, PA.;2010-05-03 21:45:00;~5 minutes;Around 12 red lights moving in loose formation over State College, PA. I was exiting the grocery store when I saw people pointing upwards and shouting. As I walked further into the parking lot and looked up there were about 12 red lights in the sky. For size perspective they looked rather like low flying aircraft lights, but there was only one light per object and the light was all I could see of the object. The lights were grouped roughly in a V formation. At first I thought that there were two irregularly shaped disks leading the formation but as objects raised and lowered in altitude as they moved south it became clear that the fairly low (but light) cloud cover meant that as objects raised above the cloud cover the light from the object reflected down below as a dark disk shape through the cloud. The objects were moving fairly slow and not as steady as I have seen most aircraft fly (more of a bobbing motion). They were moving not in unison but definitely as a group of some sort. I did not get a firm count because I would loose/see more as they changed altitude. This took place in an urban area and I lost sight as the objects moved out of my line of sight into the tree line/buildings. About another 10 or so people witnessed this in the parking lot that I was in. There is a National Guard unit stationed ~15 miles away, and there are several small airports, but none that I know of that would be doing any kind of experimental aircraft work, etc.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
Bright light flies overhead and suddenly disappears;2010-07-10 23:00:00;9seconds;Bright light flies overhead and suddenly disappears An extremely bright light flew over a friends house at the base of Tussey Mountain.  It had an irregular flight pattern. Was not possible to have been a shooting star, although I saw three or four shooting stars shortly after this event.  The bright light flew slowly in a random pattern.   I alerted my six year old daughter to look and she saw it and was freaked out by the sighting and ran into the house afterwards.  We both saw the bright light suddenly disappear.  No sound was heard.  It was not an airplane.  It was so bright that it was hard to judge how high it was.

Orange orb sighted near State College.;2012-06-07 23:35:00;30 seconds;Orange orb sighted near State College. This is an update to give a more accurate report from June 7, 2012. As previously indicated, the sightingwas very brief and occured in Lemont, PA, part of the State College metropolitan area, just east-northeast of State College. At approximately 11:35 PM, I notice a bright, glowing orb in the southern sky, looking toward Pine Grove Mills from Lemont.  Having seen orange orbs in the past and knowing what to look for, I knew it might be something out of the ordinary, so I stopped to observe the object before entering my house.  I watched for about 30 seconds, noticing that it was absolutely motionless.  Then after this duration, it began to move slowly from left to right, right to left, then left to right again, much like a leaf or feather would fall toward the ground.  The object then continued on a perfectly straight line due south beyond the horizon and out of view. The night was clear. I posted an ad in the open forum at Craigslist in an attempt to get others who might have seen the object around that same time, but no one has yet stepped forward, other than to ridicule. If others in State College and surrounding areas have seen the object on the night in question, I'd like to be put in contact with them to discuss the sighting. I prefer to be contacted by e-mail.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698

It was stationary, until it began to move closer to the horizon.   As it descended, it seemed to move much like a leaf or feather would float to the ground.;40.7982543478262;-77.8678282608698
Three white lights in a vertical formation, northeast of State College;2016-07-26 05:30:00;1 minute;Three white lights in a vertical formation, northeast of State College I feel foolish for not submitting this sighting the day I had witnessed it.  But seeing the recent reports in the northeast about three lights travelling so close together around the time of my sighting, I feel compelled to submit a report of what I saw. I don't remember the exact date, but it was around the last week of July, perhaps July 26th.  However, I do know that it was between 5:30 and 5:40 A.M., because this is the time that I go to work. Details:  As I was headed northeast on I-99, I noticed three bright lights in the northern sky, only several degrees above the horizon.  These lights remained very close to one another in a vertical formation, never separating more than about one degree from the other.  The movement of the formation was very slight, but there was definitely movement. The lights were bright white, almost silvery.  I could not distinguish a tail or anything of the sort.  As an amateur astronomer, I know for a fact that they were not planets because they were well north of the ecliptic. Conditions: Seeing conditions on this morning were clear.  During this time frame, it had been very hot in my area, with highs from the upper 80's to the mid 90's, and lows from the mid to upper 60's. If you could mark my position on Shiloh Road, looking toward the northeast drawing a straight line, the line would pass over Pleasant Gap, State Game Lands 295, and Williamsport.  There was no way for me to guess the distance of the formation. Hopefully, someone saw the same thing and can corroborate this sighting.  If you did see something that closely matches the details of my sighting, don't be shy and *don't be afraid* - REPORT IT.
