Fireball traveled from NJ over PA;2013-07-04 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Fireball traveled from NJ over PA Fireball drifted across the sky south to north east. I initially thought it was a firework but realized it wasn't burning out as it traveled across the sky with a consistent fireball throughout the duration of the sighting.   Used cell phone to take video footage when I realized it was not a firework.;40.2427;-74.8494
Blaring white light stationary in the sky slowly started to descend.;2019-01-17 17:53:00;10+;Blaring white light stationary in the sky slowly started to descend. Driving home from Oxford Valley Mall, headed towards Yardley.  It was a bright light, solid, and really bright.  It didnt move, just stayed in place.   I got a photo of it as I was driving into my neighborhood but it was starting to descend by that time.  I thought it could have been a helicopter but there wasnt any recognizable movement and the light never flickered or changed direction.  In fact it only started to disappear as my car moved.  By the time I snapped the photo a house was starting to block it.  I honestly do not know what it was.;40.2427;-74.8494
