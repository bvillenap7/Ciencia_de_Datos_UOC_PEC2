Red flickering lights in Bucks County, PA;2021-04-28 21:40:00;5 minutes;Red flickering lights in Bucks County, PA Last night, while walking my dog, I saw what appeared to be a rocket because it appeared to be flying up straight. But having seen a rocket launch before I knew that wasn't the case â€” they are loud and there are obvious flames shooting from below. The thing I saw last night then began flying across the night sky above my head. The top of it was a smattering of red and orange lights. They each flickered separately. It was as close, if not closer, than most of the planes that fly overhead. The base of the shape from which the lights came up from, appeared black and to be shaped in an upward arch. All of the lights filled an almost circular space/cluster above that arch. There was no brightness around the lights, meaning the sky didn't appear lighter around the lights. And it moved rather slowly. Didn't dart quickly or have a tail like a shooting star or meteor. Didn't hear anything coming from it. I tried to chase after it, but I wasn't able to keep up and it ! disappeared behind some trees.;40.2427;-74.8494
