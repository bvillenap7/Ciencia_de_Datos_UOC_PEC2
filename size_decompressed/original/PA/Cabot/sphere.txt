Round blob shaped UFO spotted in evening sky over Butler County, PA.;2011-04-28 19:30:00;10 seconds;Round blob shaped UFO spotted in evening sky over Butler County, PA. I was enjoying time on our giant trampoline this evening when it happened.  I saw my first ever UFO.  This round circular blob like craft was unlike anything I have ever scene before.  My eyes were immediately drawn to this object moving through the sky at a very high rate of speed. It was not an airplane, nor a balloon of any type.  It moved effortlessly through the sky at  high rate of speed before disappearing from view because of a large tree. I yelled to my friend as I ran toward far side of yard to gain a view behind the tree. That’s when the object vanished into the clouds above.  Today was slightly overcast with fast moving clouds. This object stood out to me as it traveled much faster than any cloud. I want an explanation for what I saw today.  Hopefully somebody else in the area witnessed this object as well. This is going to bother until I gain an acceptable explanation. I don’t know what else to do….;40.7938;-79.757
