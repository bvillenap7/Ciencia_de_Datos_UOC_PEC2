3 colorful objects in the sky that formed a crooked triangle.;2013-05-26 21:05:00;45  minutes;It was around 9:00 pm when I noticed 3 colorful objects in the sky that formed a crooked triangle.  I stared at this formation for awhile sitting in my room wondering if they were air crafts.  After 15 minutes of waiting they were still present and I told my mom to look out the window and she didn't think anything of it so I told my father to look and he thought they were plans in the sky.  So I argued with them for about 10 minutes and went outside on my porch to get a clear view and it was still there after 30 minutes.  I started noticing the objects change colors to red green and orange it was basically a sequence of colors.  My parents finally noticed the same thing that I was watching but was still skeptical.  But I know what I saw and they were definitely not regular airplanes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.5271;-75.5617
