Aproximately 2030 hours on 9/15/09 3 of us were setting on the back deck.  A orange light was coming in our direction that appeared to be within the atmosphere.  It approached at a rather slow rate of speed from the east.  As it became about even with us to our south it appeared to turn due south and leave the hemesphere and out of sight.  It did not go down over the horizon but disappeared quickly in an upward and southerly direction. There was no sound.;41.7711;-76.766
