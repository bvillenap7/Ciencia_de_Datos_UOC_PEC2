We were camping in ohiopyle pa, looked up at the stars and saw one that seemed to be moving.  It was the same size and brightness of the other stars in the sky, and was obviously not a plane due to the high altitude.  it looked like it was barely in our atmosphere, if at all.  It seemed to be travelling rather quickly for the altitude, came to a complete halt, made several drastic turns, stayed for about 4 or 5 minutes, the seemed to shoot straight up and disappear.;39.8531;-79.5226
