At approximately 9:45 we noticed this bright orange orb appeared in the sky.   We noticed it appeared out of nowhere.   We didn't hear any engines or normal hum of a helicopter or prop plane.   The orb grew closer and brighter and began to hover.  It moved from left to right.   The orb headed towards us moving north.  It then traveled back towards the south and appeared to dart upwards.  It grew dimmer.  As it grew dimmer, a second orange orb appeared behind it.   The orbs then just disappeared.   Please review our video.   We would like some sort of logical explanation or confirm our sighting of a UFO Thanks!!;40.0265;-79.5565999999999
