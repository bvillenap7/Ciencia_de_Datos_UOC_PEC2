Halloween ufo;1992-10-31 21:30:00;unknown;Halloween ufo It was Halloween night but I'm not certain of the year. We were driving home and I felt the strangest feeling that a ufo was above me so I looked up and saw something strange. It was a 'cluster' of lights, as if the stars in the sky were moving. I could not identify the shape but did notice about 10 moving lights, one of which were blinking an odd blue -off 0.5 second and on for about 2.5 seconds. I saw the object for about 6 seconds and it seemed to have just vanished.;40.0265;-79.5565999999999
