Illuminated objects flying in formation.;2006-08-22 19:30:00;few seconds;Illuminated objects flying in formation. It was dusk, just getting dark outside. There were about 15-20 objects flying in formation, like birds fly. However I'm very certain they weren't birds. They looked like folded paper that was illuminated from the inside. They were glowing kind of dull, not very bright a white/light blue color. There was the main group that maintained in the formation, then two of them trailing behind as if they were trying to catch up to the group. I refer to them as bird-like because I've never seen anything else fly in that sort of formation. But the objects themselves didn't have wings and weren't saucer shapped either. The best way to describe them is to imagine an oragami bird illuminated from the inside. I know it sounds weird, but it's hard to relate to something I've never seen before. It's difficult to say the size. They seemed small, ( in respect to things I usually see in the sky like planes) but I'm not really sure. They were flying below the clouds, and above the tree lines. But it was still hard to judge their distance away. The whole thing lasted about 7-10 seconds. It made no sounds like a plane or birds, just complete silence. Then then formation continued to fly into the distance until it was no longer visible. Before my friend and I walked outside and saw this formation, the same pattern appeared on his computer screen. The pattern floated across the screen, from left to right until it was off the screen. We thought that somthing was messed up with the power, so thats why we went outside. Only to find the exact same thing flying in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));40.0265;-79.5565999999999
