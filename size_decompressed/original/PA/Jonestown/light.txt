Bright circular lights light up the sky in Pennsylvania;2005-10-19 21:15:00;60 seconds;Bright circular lights light up the sky in Pennsylvania I was driving to work the night of October 19, 2005. At approximately 9:15 a bright circular light appeared in the sky.  Then one after another in a row across the sky.  They did not streak though, they just lit up in a row.  Then they disappeared and I could see blinking lights from air crafts flying all around like they were chasing each other.  There was 6-10 of them flying around at a pretty fast pace.   I kept driving and eventually could not see anything anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.4332;-76.5021
