When I listened to it fading like that, I thought it might be a helicopter from the nearby army base, Fort Indiantown Gap, PA. I went out from underneath our porch to see if I could see anything. I saw lights through our grape arbor that were sort of yellow, but they were moving. I thought it might be the moon and I might just be swaying or something. When they came out from under the cover of our grape arbor, I saw two lights that were horizontal to each other. I watched them soar across the sky at a sort of slow speed across the sky, about fifteen seconds and they were gone.;40.4332;-76.5021
