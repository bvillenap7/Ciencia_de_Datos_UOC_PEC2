Faint orange disc high in the sky that faded away and disappeared.;2008-08-14 23:30:00;10 seconds;Faint orange disc high in the sky that faded away and disappeared. On the night of Thursday, August 14th 2008, at approximately 8:30 pm, or 23:30 hours, I was driving home from picking a family member up from work. I was traveling through the area of Addison, Pennsylvania.  As I was approaching a turn I looked up in the sky and noticed something, as did my passenger.  We both saw it and commented on it at the same time. 	As I slowed the car down to get a better look at it I noticed that it was in the shape of a disc. It had a faint orange glow to it and was not moving. As I continued to stare it began to fade, which my passenger also noted. It went from a faint orange color and continued to fade until neither I, nor my passenger could see it. At this point I was nearing a heavily wooded area and was not able to see it either way. After I passed the area I continued to look for anything in the sky, anywhere, that would have held any similarity to what I had seen, but could find nothing. 	The whole incident lasted no longer than ten seconds tops. One thing I might mention, although it may have no impact on anyoneâ€™s opinions, is that my passenger is extremely cynical when it comes to these sort of things and has never believed in them. But even they felt convinced that what we had seen was something very out of the ordinary. I truly believe it was a UFO.;39.7455;-79.341
