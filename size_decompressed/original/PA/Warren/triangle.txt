Not much later one of the stars moved and joined 2 other stars, thus creating a larger triangle.  The same pattern went on for about 15 minutes, creating 10 larger triangles.   By this point I was afraid to see anything else and ran inside my house.   This is not the only time I have seen such an event, but this is the earliest that I am able to recall. Observer background: For most of my childhood I was involved with aliens.  Most of which seemed to be the form of dreams, or what I thought were dreams.  Being someone who is sensative to paranormal-like experiences I thought it a good idea to share the above experience.  Not much along the lines of UFOs has happened in my life since becoming a teenager years ago, though I do find myself drawn to UFO/extraterrestrial investigation on a regular basis.  I have noticed changes in thinking patterns in the last 3 or so years, though these do need to be looked into on a more personal basis.
