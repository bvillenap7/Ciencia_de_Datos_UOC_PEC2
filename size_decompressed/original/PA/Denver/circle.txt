Six Bright Lights in Static Formation;2006-01-26 21:00:00;20min;Six Bright Lights in Static Formation Six lights,bigger and brighter then a star.The sky was clear and about 35 degs.They were in a vertical line.All spaced even and not flashing but the light was going from dim to bright in a pulse like fashion,They started out at about 10 degs.above the horizon and moved up to about 20 degs.They changed from a straight line to a slight curve or cressent shape.I can't tell how far from me they were .I did not hear a sound.They were about the size of Venus and just as bright.I was a pilot and I know they were not normal aircraft.They stayed in the same space to long and they had no other lights but the white one.From mt location I would say they were about 270 to 280 degs.NW.This is the third time I saw them.The last time was back in 1999.Three people saw them with me and the next day I found out a friend 30 miles North East of here saw them also.It was in the local news I think.Also at that time I think strange things were reported in the sky out in the Mid West,Arizona I think.I know other people must have seen them this time.I would just like to know what they are.;40.228;-76.1159
