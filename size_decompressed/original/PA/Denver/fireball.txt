fireball, zigzagged then disappeared, Denver, Pa;2004-08-11 21:00:00;4 sec;fireball, zigzagged then disappeared, Denver, Pa It was just getting dark, I looked up and saw a fireball, I was thiking it was a shooting star, but thought it is too close to the tree line, it wasn't very big. I cant tell the size, since I couldnt figure out how high up it was. It went parallel for about 2 seconds, then zig-zagged, then disappeared. There was no sound. My family was standing with me, but didnt believe me. I thought maybe it was a meteorite, but they don't usually zig-zag and disappear.;40.228;-76.1159
