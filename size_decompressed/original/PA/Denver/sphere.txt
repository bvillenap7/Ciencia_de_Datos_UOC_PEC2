Observer see 2 orange spherical objecta seperated by about 40 seconds.;2013-09-27 21:25:00;~4 minutes;Observer see 2 orange spherical objecta seperated by about 40 seconds. I was driving home and saw an orange spherical object.  There was a church parking lot and I parked the car there and saw what appeared to be an spherical object at about 400 ft altitude traveling in a straight line path at about 35 MPH and at about 400 feet altitude (very rough estimates), this object was observed partially through car's windshield and partly from outside the car.  The elevation angle was loe perhaps 20 degrees.  I lost sight of the object as it passed on the otherside of a line of trees.  About 40 seconds after this event expired I saw a 2nd and apparently identical object following the same flight path and speed/altitude as the first object.;40.228;-76.1159
