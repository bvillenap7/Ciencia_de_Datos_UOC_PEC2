Bright Light appears in the sky at about the same time in the AM.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD));2007-09-23 00:00:00;2hrs;Bright Light appears in the sky at about the same time in the AM. 09-23-07 Good morning!  the report pertains to  events i have witnessed for 3-4days.theres been a bright light that appears at a distance,then when i look out my window it is sitting high in the sky but i can see a bright light and it is very clear.it does not go away until the sun comes up around 7:10am.ive been watching it for a about 4 days and it moves to the same spot.i usually im up on computer all night,so i look out my window at different intervals.it does not move and i don't think it is a star.a took a photo with a camera phone and it does show a bright light that has a disc look.it's ironic about the time i don't see it anymore,when its daylight i look in the sky and ive seen a jet farther away leaving a jet stream in the sky accross the field.ive witnessed these events for 2 days now.the disc dissapears and then i see the jet leaving a jet stream.it's kinda spooky to see the light park in the same place these last few nights.are there any bright things(stars in the sky that move?,that i should know about?i hope this description of the sighting is clear to you.im retired so that allows me to stay up late.

Radiant green object souring through the sky than disappearing in a flash;2008-08-03 22:00:00;10-15 seconds;Radiant green object souring through the sky than disappearing in a flash I was sitting in my bed last night looking out my window at the clear night sky when all of a sudden I saw a bright green circular light appear. The light was a bright green color and the object seemed close due to the size of the light.The light was also solid (not flashing). I sat there watching it descend downwards at an angle fairly quickly. My first thought was it was a plane that lost control and was about to crash because of the high speed it was traveling downward,  so I ran to my window. I didnâ€™t even reach my window when I saw one sudden burst of yellow/white light from the object  after watching it for about 10-15 seconds and than it was gone in a flash. I stared out my window for the next half hour  waiting to see if I could see this light again but there was no sign of it. I did see plenty of airplanes flying after this happened, however this was flying much closer to the ground. I've always been skeptical about UFO's & aliens, but now I definately am a believer!;40.228;-76.1159
Red and green objects, side by side.;2015-09-19 19:45:00;5 minutes;Red and green objects, side by side. 2 objects  left was red and right was green.  They were side by side. They appeared 80% above the horizon SW hovering then accelerated at a super high rate of speed SW and disappeared 4 or so years ago we saw a white light that hovered and did the same I reported it on here.  Why here at the same time during the Denver Fair?!;40.228;-76.1159
