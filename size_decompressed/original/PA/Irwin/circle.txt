It was quiet for about the first 15 seconds of being outside.  Next, my dog and I heard not one but multiple dogs barking and running down our street.  I didn't hear any reports from neighbors or on our local Facebook lost animals page about lost  dogs in our area either.  I volunteer for a local non-profit dog rescue and tend to get involved when people are looking for their lost pets.  I decided to investigate the situation.  I took my dog inside, grabbed my shoes and a flashlight.  I walked out the back door in our back yard and proceeded to the front of the house.  I could hear the dogs barking around me but couldn't see them. I stood out front on the street puzzled for about a minute . I walked about 20 or 30 feet up the street which was to the northwest.  I paused and looked across the horizon in the sky toward the northwest.  I immediately noticed a fairly large cir! cle object that appeared to be lifting from a location about a one mile away from where I was standing.  The object was glowing red, not that bright but bright enough to see the outline of the object.  I watched it move to the east and then south east toward my direction at a steady speed but at the same attitude.  It approached my street and I could see that the glowing red light was pulsing and the object looked semi-transparent.  It was completely silent as it flew as well.  As it was about to past over me, I heard the dogs from earlier barking and running throughout the neighborhood once again.  Even though I was about 40 feet from my house, I could hear my two dogs barking as well.  It freaked me out that I stopped looking at the object in the sky, and started to scan the area on the ground for the dogs running in the neighborhood.  A few seconds later, all the dogs stopped barking.  It was complete silence.  I took my eyes off the object for about 5 seconds.  I looked up in the ! sky again and saw that the object was now right above me but w! as at an higher attitude now.  It traveled between my property and my neighbors property going east.  I ran to the back of the yard to see if I could see it better but the treeline was blocking my view of the object.;40.3177;-79.7223000000001
