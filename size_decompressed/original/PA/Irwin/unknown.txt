I watched the one hovering with binoculars for a few minutes.  It never moved.   I went inside to get a coat.  Came back out and it was gone.  I wish I could have seen it fly away like the first one.   I saw planes tonight also.  These were not planes. Not even close.  Unless planes can sit still in the air.   This was really exciting and scary at the same time.   Never saw anything like it before.;40.3177;-79.7223000000001
