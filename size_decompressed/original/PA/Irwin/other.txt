IT WAS ABOUT 200 HUNDRED YARDS ABOVE MY CAR. I GUESS IT WAS ABOUT 100 FEET IN DIAMETER. I HAD MY WINDOWS DOWN WHEN IT WENT OVER TOP OF ME BUT COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING SO I TURNED OFF MY CAR.( THIS WAS A BACK ROAD WITH NO OTHER CARS ON IT AT THAT TIME.) BUT I STILL COULDN'T HEAR ANY SOUND COMING FROM THE UFO. I DROVE UP HILL I WAS ON AND GOT OUT OF MY CAR AND WATCHED THE UFO  TRAVEL WEST STAYING ABOUT 200 TO 300 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.
