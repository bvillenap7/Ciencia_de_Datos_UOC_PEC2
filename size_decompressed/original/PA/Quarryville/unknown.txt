Four lights seen in night sky;2005-11-22 18:05:00;Don't know;Four lights seen in night sky It was dark as I was leaving work when I saw four lights in a row behind some trees.   The best way I can describe the lights is they looked like head lights.   I was stopped, getting ready to pull out onto the street so I wasn't moving, but it was hard to tell if the lights were moving, since it was windy (I couldn't tell of the lights were moving behind the trees, or if the trees were moving in front of the lights).   Down the road there is an S turn, so when I got to it looked to my left and I could see the lights a lot better.   Here's the brightness of the lights from left to right:   The first light was dim, the second light was the brightest, the third light was dimmer than the second but not by much, and the forth light was as dim as the first one.   I know airplane landing lights are white, but there really isn't an airport any where close to Quarryville.   I'm guessing all of the lights were on the same thing, but I guess there could have been four different crafts flying in formation.;39.8949;-76.1465
