Orange Fireball sighted in Solanco;2012-08-30 22:55:00;10 minutes;Orange Fireball sighted in Solanco I saw an orange bulb with what looked like fire coming out of the back, at first I thought it was a falling star until it turned around, once it disappeared it appeared again minutes later and I watched it for a good bit outside as it turned multiple times and finally flew out of site behind trees to the west of my household.
