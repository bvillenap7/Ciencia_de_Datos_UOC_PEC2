Then about 10 seconds later i saw another real bright slow flash which they were spaced out over 10 second increments for a total of 8 flashes. Then the craft or whatever it was had more flashes but very dimmly lit as it started to move.   Ten minutes had elapsed and I saw another slow bright flash about 60 degrees from where i saw the first one and that took off at a slow rate of speed and had the same characteristics. These crafts that my sister and i encountered were at a standstill when we had observed the real bright flashes.  I read and understood your statement on fraudulant reports given in the past but as sure as Im living I would swear under law and god this was true and a very accurate report and am sorry I dont have any pictures sketches or any type of any other images to prove my sighting,but I can make up a follow-up letter of the longitude and latitude of where we observed the sighting. I thank you for your time and patients in this matter;41.8107;-77.0685
