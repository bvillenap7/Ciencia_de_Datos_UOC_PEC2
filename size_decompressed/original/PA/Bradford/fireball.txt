Green Fireball;2004-11-06 18:00:00;15 seconds;I found your site while researching whether anyone saw the green fireball on the above date.  From my front porch vantage point, it appeared to be just that-- a slow falling green fireball in the Southern sky that resembled a Roman candle firework.  I'm quite sure that it was a meteor.;41.9566;-78.6523000000001
The object was an orange/red circle that did not move for about 60 seconds until it faded away. ((anonymous report));2016-06-18 22:00:00;90 seconds;The object was an orange/red circle that did not move for about 60 seconds, until it faded away. We were sitting on our boat in the middle of the bay relaxing.  I was looking at the sky and noticed an orange light.   At first I thought it was Mars as I frequently look for it when I take my dog for his evening walk.   I noticed it was much larger than usual so I told the other two individuals I was with and they started looking at it.  We noticed it was 1 orange/red circle that flickered slightly.  It was extremely high in the sky and was in the located east relative to a compass.  We were watching it for about  60 seconds until it faded and disappeared.   10 seconds later, we noticed it came back into view but the color was not as strong and then faded away again.  The object was not moving laterally and was close to 10 times larger than Mars would be on a usual night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
