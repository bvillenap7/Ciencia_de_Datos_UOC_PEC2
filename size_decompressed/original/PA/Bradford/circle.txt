I was on the way to an overnight camp in the wilderness with my backpacking class in a car that included my instructor and a roommate. We had left Bradford and were driving along a road that was parallel to the state park we were planning to camp in, and I noticed that there were two small jets (military?) flying at about 5000 ft overhead (leaving small jet trails), and there was a small circular metallic object following closely behind the second jet. I told my car mates there was a UFO and they laughed, but my roommate then checked it out by looking up out the window and confirmed what I saw, and my instructor pulled over to see it. We got out and the object stopped following the jet and hovered above us at about a mile up (not moving for about 5 or 10 seconds) and then within about 1 or 2 seconds slid back to the tail of the second jet. It was far away but we agreed it looked metallic and seemed to be nearly circular but with many edges like a polygon with many (20? or 30?) sides (I seem to remember it reflected sunlight helping me to discern it had edges and was metallic). It left no jet trail and did appear to be able to hover and then accelerate quickly to a speed that was many times that of the jets it was following. They were headed I believe North into the state park which I remember was about 200 square miles of wilderness. That was the last we saw of them. I do remember after returning from the overnight hike, we read in the news that there had been many UFO sightings in NY north of the park at about the same time we saw ours.
