It was an un-seasonably hot sunny day and the sky was a deep blue with a few sparse, wispy white clouds. I looked to my left, out the driver side window and saw a very distinct symmetrical, shiny, silvery metallic object hovering motionlessly in the western sky. My first thought was that maybe it was a helicopter because it was just hovering there and not moving, although its perfect symmetry and chrome-like appearance did not make that seem likely. The only way I could describe it would be that it was shaped like an acorn or upside down bell with the wider end up. I looked later on the internet for photos of “acorn shaped UFO’s” and was surprised to find that they were not that uncommon. The only difference was that the pictures that I found showed the object inverted, with the wider end facing down. I continued to watch the object for about 15 or 20 seconds and then to my amazement, it just faded away into the blue sky over the course of 4 or 5 seconds. That’s when I was convinced that I had seen a UFO. Weather balloons or helicopters don’t just disappear right before your eyes.;41.9566;-78.6523000000001
