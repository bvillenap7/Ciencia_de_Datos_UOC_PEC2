Streaks of light appeared that resembled vapor trails only shorter.  They appeared to be following each other and appeared one at a time from out of nowhere.   We thought they could be part of the meteor shower that was supposed to occur the previous night.  However, one of the streaks changed direction.  It was travelling from right to left, but then followed the others left to right.  This occured in the southwest sky.   Our house is on a high cliff and we are able to see quite a distance over the mountain tops.  We are on the Delaware River and this occurred over New York State noy PA.;41.8135;-75.1844
