A bright lights bursts into 4 or 5 other lights then dissappears.;2005-03-15 21:50:00;5 minutes;A bright lights bursts into 4 or 5 other lights then dissappears. My brother and I were coming home from Reading on RT I-81 southbound when I saw a bright light off in the distant sky.  I thought it was strange because it just dissappeared.  He didnt see it at this point but I started a conversation with him about UFO's.  He seen one back in the early 70's...quite different from this one.  Anyway, all of the sudden this bright light appears in the sky right in front of us and then it bursts into 4 or 5 other lights in a line then dissappeared so quickly.  He was yelling...what the H**l was that?...then it happened again.  He pulled over and as I was looking out my window, again, a bright light bursting into other lights.  I yelled....go....go ....from that point on all we could see was two lights in the sky off in the distance and we watched them till they were gone.  Oh my, Ive always wanted to see something...Ive always been fascinated by the prospect of UFO's.  Now I can say for sure that I dont just believe...I know.  I cant believe we didnt have a accident....its a major highway.....and there were many other cars on the road....I just wonder if other people will report this.  They HAD to have seen it.;40.3644;-76.6722
