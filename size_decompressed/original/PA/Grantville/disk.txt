She proceeded to tell me that she saw two alien saucers approach our area while waiting for the bus. She said that one of them had a sparkly light that came out of the bottom of one of the ships in a tubular shape, went down towards the ground and stayed there for about 15 seconds and came back up the ship. Then both ships left the area going away from our house. My daughter is not the imaginative type, and she was terrible, and still is afraid that something will happen to her or her family. She prayed that whole day that nothing would happen, and she cannot sleep well ever since it happened.;40.3644;-76.6722
