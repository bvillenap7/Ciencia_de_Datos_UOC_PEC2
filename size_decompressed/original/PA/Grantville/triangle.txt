So I ask why. He replied that he and my sister in law had seen a fling triangle on Sunday evening may 18th while standing in our church parking lot. I asked him to draw a picture of what he saw and he did. Which fit perfectly with what I understand them to look like. I don't think he has ever seen a picture of a flying triangle so I feel his report is completely truthful. He has seen saucer type crafts in photos, but not triangles. His description is as follows. It was a perfect triangle with lights on each side. The drawing showed 5 lights per side where the end light would be counted on both sides.  12 lights total. He said its was about 1 inch long and moved much faster than any plane. The location was out in the country away from any small towns. It was on route 443 at the Appleby RD intersection. About 7 miles northeast of Harrisburg pa. And 4 miles north of Grant!ville pa. I will attempt to confirm the report with my sister in law on Monday. Until then.;40.3644;-76.6722
