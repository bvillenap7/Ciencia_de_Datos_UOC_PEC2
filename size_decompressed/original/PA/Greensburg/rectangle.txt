I was outside observing the night sky with a telescope from my deck. It was a clear night with plenty of stars. I spent some time focusing on different parts of the sky. At about 9:15 pm I put the telescope away, went back outside and I saw what appeared to be 7 to 9 rectangular gold objects, all traveling north in a formation like birds might do, but in one diagonal line.  These objects were below the clouds and appeared to be very large in size.  From where I was standing, I could cover one of them with my thumbnail.  It appeared that the objects were equal size and distance from each other, perfectly parallel. These objects were identical: gold and almost transparent in color, and they seemed to be speckled and have a rough texture. There was a constant light coming from each of them, like a glow or illumination.  The objects were illuminated but there were no singular lights on the objects. I did not hear any noise or sound coming from the objects in the sk! y like you might hear from a plane, jet, or helicopter.  I watched these objects move until they were out of sight, about 12 to 15 seconds.  I have not been able to explain what I have seen as it is nothing like I have experienced before.;40.3051999999999;-79.5418
