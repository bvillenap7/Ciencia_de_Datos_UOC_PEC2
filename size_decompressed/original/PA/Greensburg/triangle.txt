Super bright light;2020-05-07 03:30:00;2-3 minutes;Super bright light Around 3:30am, I was driving along Route 66 southbound just heading into Greensburg when I first caught glimpse of what I thought was a star, but this thing was super bright, even brighter than Venus, that it immediately caught my eye, so I knew it couldn't have been a planet. At that point, this thing had to have been about a mile and a half away, and the closer I got to it, it seemed to just hover in the same spot. I passed Shop 'n Save and this thing is now almost right overhead, and I could tell that it was a triangular formation of three lights, and it was literally floating across the sky at a snail's pace.  I also noticed that one of the lights were pulsating on and off.  I continued on towards Greensburg and lost sight of the object.  Not sure what I had seen but it gave me a pretty weird feeling.;40.3051999999999;-79.5418
