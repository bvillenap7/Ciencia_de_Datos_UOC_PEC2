I saw one big bright green light fall from the sky... almost like a flare... but it was big...  I was driving along Rte. 66 between Greensburg & Delmont, & there was no exit near or I would have followed it.  It looked to me to be a meteor or a chunk of debris from something... only glowing extremely brightly green.  It looked like something out of a dman movie.  It hit the ground probably 5 - 10 miles away from the Road...  It was VERY bright. I stopped the car to look around & up in the sky... saw nothing else.  I didn't know if we were under some sort of attack or what.  Stuff doesn't just usually fall from the sky.;40.3051999999999;-79.5418
Peculiar lights seen over shopping area;2013-08-26 20:40:00;2 minutes;Peculiar lights seen over shopping area I was driving home with my mother along Route 30 heading eastbound when we spotted two orange lights in the sky near the Hempfield Plaza shopping center.  They appeared similar to a fireball and were in close proximity to one another.  Not once did we notice it drifting apart or do anything erratic, it simply moved together in the same position.  Furthermore, it had been moving parallel in our direction as we sat at the light.  As we continued towards Greensburg, we saw another similar looking ball cross Route 30 and pass right over the Greengate Walmart plaza.  It had been moving south to north. This light had the same color and size, but it was not part of the first group of lights that we saw previously.  From the first group of lights to the last one, about two minutes had passed by. I have a feeling that other people may have seen the lights because there were plenty of people out that evening.;40.3051999999999;-79.5418
