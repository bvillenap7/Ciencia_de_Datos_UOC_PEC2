Looking into west-north-west sky we saw a ball of light.  Watched for about 10 minutes, and in that time it appeared to move slightly west. Appeared to have slight red/blue haze around it.  I watched to see if it would move or if it was a helicopter, but it was very still.  Also that night, there was a very loud boom. I do not know time of boom. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been observing the planet Venus, which is in the western sky at the time indicated.  PD));40.3051999999999;-79.5418
