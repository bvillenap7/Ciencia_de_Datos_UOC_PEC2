Possible contact with Visitor as a child;1969-01-01 10:00:00;unknown;Possible contact with Visitor as a child When I was 2 to 4 years old (1968-1970), my mother wrote down in a journal that I had a pretend friend whose name was Arjid.  I don't remember this pretend friend at all. However, a few months back on a whim I looked up the word on the internet. It turned up in one language only, called Manx, meaning Highness.  I had no idea what Manx was or where it was spoken. I did some research and found out it is an extinct Gaelic language once spoken on the Isle of Mann off the coast of England.  In one of Whitley Strieber's books, Transformation, that there was a possible connection mentioned between the Gaelic languages and the Visitors.  I suspect that maybe I was visited at a very young age in Greensburg.  There was one other incident, maybe around 1970 or 1971, where I thought I saw a purplish silhouette of a man (or something) standing outside my second story window. He (or it) would have been standing on our sun parlor roof. Anyway, it scared the shit out of me. But I have always passed that off as a hallucination, or maybe even an after image from rubbing my eyes. It also could have been my older sister playing a prank on me.

Red lights over residential neighborhood;2011-03-08 20:15:00;1 minute;Red lights over residential neighborhood I was driving along US Route 30 westbound with my mother headed to Walmart just after 8:15 pm. After passing the Greensburg/Mt.   Pleasant exit, I noticed a red light sitting stationary in the sky towards the left side of my windshield in the distance, which would put it over the South Greensburg area.  I told my mother if she noticed it, but she said no.  Soon after, as we approached the Cedar Street exit, she finally noticed it after taking another look, which actually appeared to be two red lights hovering stationary over a residential neighborhood.  The lights, which remained steadily lit the entire time, didn't appear to be close to each other nor did they move apart, which makes me wonder if it could've been a large craft hovering above the neighborhood.  We continued on our way towards the US Route 119 exit but didn't notice anything else as we continued heading west. This occurred within a one minute timeframe, although I had slowed considerably when I not! iced the lights in the vicinity of the Cedar Street exit.  A few minutes later, we noticed a helicopter flying towards the direction of the sighting although it appared to be a medical helicopter.  Traffic in this area was relatively steady, weather conditions were partly cloudy in the low 40s.;40.3051999999999;-79.5418
