Then reappeared for only a second or two and then disappeared.  It appeared to be more of a reflection than a light. The sky was clear with several plane trails. The sun was setting and I believe it was a reflection of the setting sun on a metal object. I heard no sound nor saw any trail. It was much higher than any plane.;40.3051999999999;-79.5418
White light appeared in the middle of night sky.;2012-05-20 22:00:00;5 min.;White light appeared in the middle of night sky. As my wife and I were looking at the stars, out of nowhere a bright white light (very large, compared to other stars) appeared in the middle of the night sky.  It disappeared for a second and then we saw it “skip” across the night sky into the horizon.   The distance it traveled by the time we saw it next was a very long distance, and not in a straight line.  There was no sound whatsoever.

Star-like light suddenly vanishes after a few minutes;2012-05-31 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;Star-like light suddenly vanishes after a few minutes A few friends and I were sitting on the deck in the back of my house a little after 10:30pm since it was a warm night.  We noticed a white colored star-like light in the northeast sky towards the direction of Greensburg.  It was as bright as Venus and was moving in our direction.  Oddly, the light would flicker at times, staying bright for several seconds and then gradually losing luminosity until it was barely noticeable, and return back to brightness once again.  This occurred a few times. A few minutes later, as we continued talking about it, the light simply vanished without a trace.  There were breaks in the clouds that night so it should still have been noticeable as it passed above the clouds and back into open view.  Location of sighting was in the Fort Allen neighborhood, near Hempfield Area High School.;40.3051999999999;-79.5418
Bright golden reddish light moving in multiple directions - second sighting.;2015-08-26 23:00:00;5 minutes;Bright golden reddish light moving in multiple directions - second sighting. My husband had told me about seeing something like this about a week prior, but within a different direction than last night.  However, the specs were the same.   I was in the house when he called me to hurry and come outside, that thing was in the sky like he saw before, but this time to the south (last time was east).  When I got outside, I observed a reddish-orange bright light that appeared to be descending but steady pace.  After only a few minutes, it stopped moving all together.   After only a few seconds, it began to move horizontally to the east and then stopped again.  It appeared to hover while moving a tight circular pattern in each place it stopped.  It would descend and move horizontally west and back east after each stop.  It even made a quick movement back UP at one point.   I told my husband to flash his flashlight, but surprisingly he refused (he has interest in these types of things, watches a lot of documentaries).   Right before it disappeared it began moving in what appeared to be a horizontal pattern away from us, so it either disappeared or moved out of sight because the light slowly dimmed during this process.  I went back in the house to get my phone to record it, but had the phone focused on the neighbor's light instead of the sky and didn't realize it until it was gone because I was watching the sky, not my phone.   I'll try again of the opportunity presents itself.;40.3051999999999;-79.5418
I saw about 20-30 light moving across the sky all in 1 line.
