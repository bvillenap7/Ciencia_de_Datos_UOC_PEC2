Strange glow in the woods;2000-07-14 03:00:00;10 minutes;Strange glow in the woods I was on the computer at about 3AM, when I looked out my deck sliding doors and noticed an orange glow coming from the densely wooded area just beyond the parking lot of my old apartment. It must've lasted for about 10 minutes or so, but it felt like it was a lot longer, but anyway, I thought that somebody must've been camping out in the woods in the middle of the night and made a campfire for light, because it was too warm to have a fire in the first place. Suddenly, the glow started to move slowly left and right then it gradually disappeared. The next day, I go out into the woods to check it out and after walking around for about a half an hour, I find nothing to suggest that there was a fire. This is an area within town that has experienced UFO activity in the past with sightings around the former Greengate Mall in the 70s. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
