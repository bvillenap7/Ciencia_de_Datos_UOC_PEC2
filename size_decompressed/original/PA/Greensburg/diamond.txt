new sighting;2002-07-03 22:00:00;1 hour;new sighting Tonight I went outside I was just sitting there enjoying my garden and the night when I noticed what looked like a star. But then I noticed it was below the clouds and there were no stars around it. It was so bright I thought it was maybe a planet but then again it was way too close. It was huge and bright all shinning and shimmering. I saw it moving rather funny so I called my son to come have a look. I thought it might be a helicopter or plane but neither one flies like that. I saw several planes go near there and they were drawrfed by the size of this thing. Then after about and hour it just shot stright up into the sky. I was not sure where to report this to or who to call I am a 42 year old female and run a multi million dollar operation. I am not making this up.;40.3051999999999;-79.5418
