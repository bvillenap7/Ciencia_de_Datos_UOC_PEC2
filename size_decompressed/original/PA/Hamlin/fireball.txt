i saw a ufo;2002-07-13 01:00:00;3 mins.;i saw a ufo Around 1:00am my two friends and i were sitting by the lake and noticed what appeared to be a moving star coming directly from the south.  As it came directly overhead, the light became extremely bright as if it was shining down to us.  The object was moving from south to north and was silent.  After shining on us for about a minute, it stopped shining as bright.  It continued moving north until it zigzagged and disappeared, disproving any theory that it was a satilite.  We were so psyched that we began flashing a flashlight at the sky and turning it on and off.  Another one appeared at approx. 1:15 zig zagged aroung the flashlight and disappeared. Few minutes after the encounter, a helicopter was heard to the northeast.;41.4076;-75.4081
