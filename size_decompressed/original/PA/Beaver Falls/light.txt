Star turns OFF like a light bulb.;2002-04-01 19:45:00;2 seconds;Star turns OFF like a light bulb. Arrived home after spending the Easter weekend and most of Monday with my parents. The time was roughly 7:45pm. I unloaded a suit case and took it into my apartment. I had to make one more trip to bring in a basket of laundry still in the car. When I walked out the front door and happened to looked up 50 to 60 degrees from horizon, approx. due East, temperature in mid to upper 30's, CLEAR sky, NO clouds visible.  Out of ALL those stars, I look RIGHT AT THE ONE STAR [LIGHT?] THAT TURNED OFF! Just like a light bulb. Weird. I didn't notice anything strange about the star, until it went out. There were other stars around this one, but it was the brightest star in that small cluster. What are the odds of that? There's a small airport nearby, but I heard NO engines. This light DIDN'T move and it seemed to be in space, NOT within the atmosphere. Two seconds of observation isnt long enough to get detail on the object other than star like. I stood there listening and watching for any sign of an aircraft strobes and lights, but I saw and heard nothing. Unrelated to this incident: I was in Ebensburg PA. renting some video's on Saturday March 30th, the clerk checking us out had told me 4 people the night before (29th)had sighted a UFO in the sky above the parking lot. She said the lights were revolving in a circular pattern. I didnt get much detail other than that. ((NUFORC Note:  Very good report, we feel.  However, the first two possibilities to be ruled out would be the flash of an Iridium satellite, or the bright flash from a tumbling rocket booster shell.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  One of three sighting reports from same source.  Please see other reports for 09/15/94 and 02/15/95 from Pennsylvania.  PD));40.7706000000001;-80.3575999999999
Bright light in sky turns off - Nothing there!;2002-08-12 20:15:00;15 seconds;Bright light in sky turns off - Nothing there! This is the 2nd time I've seen a bright light in the sky turn off with nothing there! Traveling West along 588 in Beaver county PA., approx. 2 miles from intersection of of Rt. 65. I noticed a bright light low and close in the sky (2000 - 3000 AGL and a quarter mile to my SW)that was different. At first I shruged it off as a landing light from a small aircraft (Zeileinople and Beaver Co. Airports in area). Something kept my attention on it (NO vibration/strobe affect as in traditional landing lights) just an intense light slightly brighter than a landing light and it also seemed fixed or stationary. Then as my attention seemed peaked, it turned off... I fully expected to see the familiar silhouette of a Cessna or Piper in the turquois dusk sky... but there was NOTHING THERE! I immidiatley pulled off the side of the road and shut my engine off to listen for the purr of a Lycoming engine, but the only thing I heard was crickets... This is starting to get weird Pete! I'm extremly familiar with aircraft observation, clouds and lights, I'm still trying to convince myself that there is a rational explaination but so far I haven't been sucsessful. Watching the Watchers...? Signs of the Second Coming...? Religion or Star Wars...? Let me know your thoughts.… ((name deleted));40.7706000000001;-80.3575999999999

Red flashing unmoving light over the river not attached to anything that moved sharp down and right and went out.;2013-11-04 06:15:00;5-10 minutes;Red flashing unmoving light over the river not attached to anything that moved sharp down and right and went out. I’ve never been on your site before.  Just found you via Google while looking to see if anyone else had seen what I saw.  I am doing this in Word like you asked.  Anyway, here goes. On Monday 11/04/2013, around 6:15 am, I was sitting in my car in the Sunoco gas station parking lot waiting for my old man to get me a coffee for the road.  This is the gas station right across the road from Geneva College playing field, and right behind the tool rental place, on Route 18 in Beaver Falls, PA. I was looking east over the river when I saw this light.  It was red, blinking on and off, and I thought it might be a radio tower light.  But as the sky grew a little lighter, I could see there was no tower, wires nor anything the light could have been mounted on because the hills in the east were in relief against the sky and the light was higher up than the hills.  It was totally unmoving, except for the blinking.  The stars were moving as they normally do.  Then I saw little clouds pass behind this thing over the hills so I knew it must have been right above the river.  It started to blink with a slightly different speed and then it dropped straight down and then straight over to the right.  Then the light went out. Don’t know if this was anything like a UFO but I wanted to find out if anyone else saw it.  I am a 60+ year old woman and not some kind of nut who sees things.  We are new to that area having just got a retirement home there that we are working on, and I am thinking maybe it is something else, like a regular light in the area we don’t know about.  Just wanted to report this to see if anyone knows what this is.  That’s all.;40.7706000000001;-80.3575999999999
Mysterious silent moving lights in sky;2019-10-24 09:45:00;10 minutes;Mysterious silent moving lights in sky Observer 12 bright orange aircraft I assume.  It is hard to tell altitude or size but would guess under 3000 ft. Made no sound.  Not moving fast but moving at a decent clip.  The lights or light were not really defined, kind of blurry.  Seen by myself and my wife.  I have video;40.7706000000001;-80.3575999999999
