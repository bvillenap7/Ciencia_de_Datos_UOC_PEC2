Large triangular object with three green lights seen in Solebury, PA;2020-06-12 21:48:00;0:30;Large triangular object with three green lights seen in Solebury, PA UFO SIGHTING IN DOYLESTOWN, PA We have a 2 acre property with a Doylestown address but in the New Hope/Solebury area. It was at 9:48  p.m. and we were sitting in our backyard, 1 of us in the hot-tub, the other two sitting around the firepit next to the hot tub, when we saw a large dark object hovering just above the tree line about 200 yards away. The object was about the size of half a football field. We could feel its vibration above the hot tub bubbles but it was quiet. It seemed to be in the shape of a triangle. There were 3 green lights on the object. It moved slowly and then it disappeared. All 3 of us saw it. It was too large to be a helicopter or an airplane.;40.319320338983;-75.1310457627118
