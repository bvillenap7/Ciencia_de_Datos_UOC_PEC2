UFO shaped like a plane that is parked over the top of a house (Bucks County Flap).  ((anonymous report));2019-10-11 16:00:00;1 minute;UFO shaped like a plane that is parked over the top of a house (Bucks County Flap) Around the time of the Bucks County, PA, flap, I had several UFO sightings.  This was my 3rd sighting around that time.  I was driving home from work and was heading towards Route 611 on Almshouse Rd.  It was dark outside and I saw an enormous UFO.  It looked like a 737 plane with its lights off and it was parked directly on top of a house.  It looked like the UFO was attached to the roof of the house and the sky was blocked out in between the roof and the UFO.  I looked in the rearview mirror as I passed it and it was still there.  The house was in a development that was on a large hill surrounded by  trees.  I could see it from the driver's side window.  Time seems to stop whenever I see the UFO's and there is no noise. The three sightings that I had in Bucks County were three different shapes.  I seem to see UFO's when I'm driving alone.  I hope other people in the area saw this UFO.;40.319320338983;-75.1310457627118
