DARK RECTANGLE WITH ABOUT 16 LIGHTS UNDER IT (2 rows of 8) MOVING SLOW AND LOW!;2012-07-09 21:00:00;10 minutes;DARK RECTANGLE WITH ABOUT 16 LIGHTS UNDER IT (2 rows of 8) MOVING SLOW AND LOW! I was driving home from work, and saw a BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT high up in the sky.... I thought it was odd --- and I remember seeing this bright light before a few months back (like six months ago), and I was driving in the direction toward it.... It was hovering for a little while and slowly made its way in the direction toward me, headed towards Chalfont. I passed it slowly and got a really good look because it was moving real slow and was REALLY LOW. It was slowly traveling over CB West Highschool when I got a good look at it.  It was a DARK RECTANGLE, with like 8 white lights under it in two rows to make about 16 lights total.  There was like one red and one green light in the backside of the rectangle (underneath).   All I could keep saying was, What the fuck is that?  What the fuck is that?!?    AAAnndd of course my phone's broken so I couldn't call anyone, so I am just freaking out by myself.  I parked my car and got out to see it again but it was pretty far away at that point, and all I could see was a red light  then (I guess maybe its their brake lights haha).  But yea it was super weird and creepy and I HAD to post this SOMEWHERE because I can't stop thinking about it. So that's that. I'm hoping ET is friendly.;40.319320338983;-75.1310457627118
