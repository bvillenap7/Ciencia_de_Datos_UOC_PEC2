Strange meteor-like light, green and blue, long trail, very big;2002-01-20 19:30:00;Few Seconds;Strange meteor-like light, green and blue, long trail, very big Driving southbound on Rt 611 (Easton Rd.) toward Warrington, PA -- saw a strange green meteor-like object on horizon drop straight down, very long trail, phosphorescent and glowed strange -- then dissipated into a blue sort of wash.  Item at end (beginning?) of light streak appeared to be flat like a small bar.  The streak stayed in the sky for a few more seconds then was gone.  Didn't think to enter this report, but two nights ago, someone else was on the same road, same spot, saw the same thing in almost precisely the same sky (this was 02/23/02, around 2:30 AM).

Giant blue glowing light, makes a few movements, shoots off into sky.;2008-06-01 22:00:00;10 seconds;Giant blue glowing light, makes a few movements, shoots off into sky. Okay, so I decided to tell this story because its the only UFO type of thing I have ever seen, and seems substantially different then most sightings.  It started off as a mid summer day in the month of June id say in 2008-2009.  I was sleeping over a friends house and the next morning we were going to center city Philadelphia to go skate.  I live about 40 miles from Philly in Doylestown, so we would usually take the train.  But, the night before we had gone I was to be sleeping in his basement (he had a rancher house so there was no upstairs, only first floor and basement) while he was in his bed upstairs.  It was a boring night just watching tv on his pull out couch, I was alone because my friend was talking to his mom in his room. I was swiftly greeted by my friends weiner dog Barney.  He then darted over to the wide open screen door (Basement had a door which lead to a patio) .  A little odd I thought at first considering he wasn't much of a guard dog and usuall! y wouldn't just start tearing ass around the house just to look out a window.   So as I'm sitting there just watching tv when the dog starts barking. I was curious so I decided to see what was going on. I do a quick visual sweep of the patio, and saw nothing.  But then, I looked up and shit got full on crazy. I saw this MASSIVE huge glowing ball of blue, it was a really deep cool looking color.  It rose from behind the tree line in the distance and was dead silent. It cut left quickly for a little bit, then veered back and up then shot off quicker than anything I have ever seen before. I instantly freaked out and ran upstairs.  I started yelling if anybody saw what I just did and my friend and his Mom just replied no.  I tried to debunk what I saw but it wasn't any holiday with fireworks, the airport was across the other side of town, and not to mention that a bright blue orb of glowing light doesn't really remind of a plane.  No explanation was ever found, still confu! sed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.319320338983;-75.1310457627118

As i return home standing out on my pourch i notice a train being left in the clouds above me maybe about 500 to 700 feet up as ling as a football feild was the length of the trail the object was not seen almost transparent as it quickly moved across the sky then off in the distance about 7 miles away i notice a haze forming in the clouds not a natural formation this haze was in the form of a large object with clusters of smaller hazes surrounding it. then out of nowhere they all vanish.;40.319320338983;-75.1310457627118
