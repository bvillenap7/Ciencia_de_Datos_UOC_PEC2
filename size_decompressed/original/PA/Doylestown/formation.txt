At 19:00 Eastern time plus or minus a few minutes, I noticed two lights in the south sky. From my viewpoint in Doylestown, PA, they appeared between the stars Sirius and Betelgeuse, and moved little, if at all.  The lights were about -1 magnitude brightness.  After several seconds, they faded, and then disappeared from view.  There were no clouds in that part of the sky. The lights were star-like, and mostly white with a trace of blue.  Both objects were identical in color and tone.  I doubt these were commercial or military aircraft.  There is not enough information to judge distance or altitude.;40.319320338983;-75.1310457627118
