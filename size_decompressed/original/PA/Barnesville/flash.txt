Giant LED light;2004-11-07 20:00:00;quick;Giant LED light We were walking out my drive way when the whole area around my cuzint and I was very suddently bathed in bright white light. I thought it was the moon, and looked up into the sky too see what I can only decribe as 1,000,000 watt LED light. It was in the northern sky, and seemed to be very high in the air, and looked exstreamly big.  I whatched it flash 3 times fairly quickly, and everytime it flashed, for as far as i could see was lit up with white light. It didn't move at all. It just disipaired after the last flash,and there was nothing else to see to exsplian it. It made no noise.;40.814;-76.0563
