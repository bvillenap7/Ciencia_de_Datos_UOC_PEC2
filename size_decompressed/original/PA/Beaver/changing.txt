Two hovering, luminous yellow-white oval shaped lights joined like a barbell, with a long silver appendage and haze beneath it,;2007-11-02 16:12:00;90 seconds;Two hovering, luminous yellow-white oval shaped lights joined like a barbell, with a long silver appendage and haze beneath it, At  4:12 PM, on November 2nd, 2007, I sighted two hovering, luminous yellow-white oval or disc shaped lights joined, side by side, to resemble a barbell.  Both were similar in appearance and seemed to be joined to each other by a very small darkened area located directly between them.  At first glance, my attention was drawn to what looked like one long, thin, silver rod like appendage extending downward from beneath these two adjoining lights. I could also see a faint haze with a clearly defined outer edge located beneath each of the two luminous objects. Perhaps this was due to heat or propulsion, I don't know. Yet, each of these two very faint, hazy areas were clearly shaped like the letter U.  And the silver appendage was centered between these two hazy U shaped areas, in a very symmetrical pattern.  The total width of the two adjoined lights was at least as wide as a cruising jetliner. The vertical appendage beneath them was twice as long as this total width. The appendage gradually faded from view as the two disc shaped lights began to merge together to form one luminous cigar shaped object, though the small darkened area at the center remained.  From my location, driving east on Dutch Ridge Road, near the Beaver Medical Center, I'd estimate that the object(s) was hovering over Rochester or the Beaver River, at about a 2 o'clock position in the sky. The sky was blue and perfectly clear. Winds were light.  I didn't see the object fly away nor wink out. I lost sight of the object behind trees near Maplewood Drive, as I was then leaving the top of the ridge.;40.6946;-80.3402
