orange glows following path;2013-07-04 21:15:00;90 minutes;orange glows following path Saw three different orange glowing balls fly across the sky in the same pattern, following a semi circular pattern then disappearing.  The object started out over the trees, came across west to east and then back towards its original point before disappearing and another following the same path.  No sound emitted, and not very high off the ground, maybe 500 feet approximately.;40.8736;-78.279
