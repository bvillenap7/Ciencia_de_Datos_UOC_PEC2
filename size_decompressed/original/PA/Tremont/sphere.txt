Ten Orbs Staggered but Still;2011-09-10 20:00:00;4 minutes;Ten Orbs Staggered but Still I and my fianc√© were driving one night from Lebanon, Pa to Pottsville, PA.  We took 72 and then went onto Route 209.  We have been up there many times.  That night we both noticed about 10 orange orbs staggered in the sky. At first, I did not think much of it, thought it was radio towers, but as we passed, I realized and looked back and realized that tower lights are usually red or white and they blink.  They looked very close and bright.  We knew where we were, and knew we never seen them before.  When we came back in daylight there are no towers of any kind. It bothers me to this day, what I seen.  The route we take is State Game lands and not a busy area.  I have always read about UFO hanging around military installations.  Fort Indiantown Gap not far from where we had seen these orange orbs.  These orbs did not move but were staggered. I thought about that night over and over again. It bothers me to this day and had to find out if there were sightings of these orange orbs in the year 2011 between Jonestown, PA, and Pottsville, PA.
