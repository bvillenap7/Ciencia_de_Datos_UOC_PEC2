Strange Fireball Floats over Carbondale PA;2008-07-04 22:00:00;4 minutes;Strange Fireball Floats over Carbondale PA The object looked like a bright fireball traveling from the west at a very slow pace that lasted about 4 minutes then started to rise. At that time it got lost in the cloud cover for a few seconds and re appeared through the clouds when at that point it shot of to the south with much faster speed. This was the second time within a three-week span that this occurred. The first time it just floated from south to north at a very slow pace.

Orange fireball hovering in the sky, then disappearing;2010-07-04 21:00:00;3 hours;Orange fireball hovering in the sky, then disappearing About 10 of us were having a July 4th barbeque, when someone spotted an object in the sky.  It looked like a round orange fireball and was bigger than any star, but smalled than the moon.  It was about 5 times the size of Venus.  It moved very slowly around the sky, both with and against the wind.  It did this for about 45 minutes, then just faded and disappeared, almost like it took off straight up into the atmosphere.   About an hour later, it reappeared.  This time lower in the sky and behind some trees.  This second appearance lasted about 30 minutes and then it slowly rose up and then took off just like before.   It reappeared a third time, just before 11:00 PM and we decided to call it a night, because it was very unsettling. I'm an amatuer astronomer and have spent many nights looking at the sky, but I've never seen anything like that.  It was definitely not a firework, they couldn't remain lit that long.  It wasn't an airplane, helicopter, or balloon.  It also wasn't any natural phenomenon known to science.  I didn't believe in UFOs until that night.   I'll be spending even more time outside looking up now.;41.5854;-75.5012
