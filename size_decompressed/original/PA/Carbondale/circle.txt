Police and military personal were notified. Divers went into the water and retrieved something, which was put into a large closed trailer.  Official report said it was a miner's latern.  Paul Bunyon must have thrown it from Phila.  My father and I watched the whole thing.  Dad died in 1976 and I have never told anyone that we watched everything that was done from a nearby hill.  Neither the police or the military knew we were watching.  They had cordened off the area so sight seers could not get near their operations.  We had a birds-eye view.
