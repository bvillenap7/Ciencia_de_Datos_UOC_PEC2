August 8, 2006 Lancaster, PA at 1 pm  I saw a steel blue oval shaped object traveling rapidly in a straight line in front of the clouds;2006-08-08 13:00:00;20 TO 30 SECONDS;August 8, 2006 Lancaster, PA at 1 pm  I saw a steel blue oval shaped object traveling rapidly in a straight line in front of the clouds We were on our lunch break.  A co-worker of mine was explaining how rainbows form inside the ice crystals of stratus clouds.  I looked up at the sky and my attention was immediately grabbed by an small object flying through the sky.  It was very small, but I could DEFINATELY identify it's color and shape.  It was oval shaped...almost like the shape that a ball assumes if you put pressure on it.  It was not as flat as the stereotypical 'flying saucer' shape...more round.  I immediately thought to myself...that looks like a freakin' UFO!!  I stared and stared as it flew rather quickly across the sky...in front of the clounds.  It's color was a very dark, steel blue.  I tracked it across the sky with my finger.  My other coworkers were returning from their lunch breaks also.  I was pointing and screaming...Look! What is that? What is that?  My coworkers were yelling back at me, Where? Where?  I I was freaking out, jumping up and down, yelling Right there! Right there!  But no one saw the stupid thing.  I was in shock as it disappeared from sight behind the roof of our office.    I am still in shock that no one saw it.  I've been running around the office trying to talk with the people who were out there...and they look at me like I am nuts.  I am submitting this report because I want to know if someone else saw something, or if there was a weather balloon, or jet fighter flying over Lancaster County, Pennsylvania at 1 pm on August 8, 2006.  I know people think I'm imagining things.  I really want some type of affirmation.  I know what an airplane looks like.  I know what jet fighters look like.  THEY ARE NOT ROUND!!  Was it a weather balloon?  Can they travel that fast?  This thing was not floating.  It didn't hover.  It didn't start and stop.  It didn't fly sideways.  It flew in a straight line.  It was fast.  IT WAS OVAL shaped!  It was DARK BLUE!  I am a college educated professional woman.  I don't believe in extraterrestial abductions and all of that sci-fi stuff.  I would really like to explain this.  I know people think I was hallucinating.  Perhaps I was.  I hope that someone out there saw it also.  I hope that it has an explanation.  If not...then I need to do some serious thinking.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851

Very still in the sky and then disappeared. Driving East on route 30 reaching a light.  I noticed a sparkle and or reflection of sun in the sky and started to stare and noticed an oval shaped (zeppelin shape in comparison) silverish mirror like material hovering or floating in the sky. The object was very still.  Then it seemed or started to turn in a different direction.  Because I noticed the shape changing.   Then it just seemed to vanish like magic.  All this in about 2-3 minutes.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851

I noticed one larger oval shaped object.;2015-08-04 20:58:00;5 minutes;On August 4, 2015, at 8:58pm when I went to see 3 stars constellation & took a picture.  I noticed one larger oval shaped object releasing 3 or 4 oval lighted objects.  Admitting (sic.  Emitted??) an intense glowing yellow light.  One red light also appeared amongst the above mentioned yellow ones.   Upon later reviewing my camera footage I saw a silver pod behind objects.   I have photos which I'd be happy to send as well.
