This is the second time we witnessed what appeared to be an aircraft on fire flying across the sky.  The craft moved quicker tonight and we were able to discern a silver disc shape after the &quotflames&quot went out.  The path was almost identical to the last sighting.  There was no sound and the sky was relatively clear.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851
