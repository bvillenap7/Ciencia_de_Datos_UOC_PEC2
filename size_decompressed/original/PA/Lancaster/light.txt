I saw a bright light following me in the sky as I walked my dog.;1999-10-21 20:00:00;15 minutes;I saw a bright light following me in the sky as I walked my dog. Last night as I was walking my dog in our neighborhood, I glanced at the sky and noticed a white light.  At first I thought it was an airplane as I could see another airplane in the sky.  This light seemed to follow us.  I walked around the block and kept glancing over my shoulder and sure enough the light was there.  Then I thought well it's just a star, but how could it be following us.  I was so dumbfounded than when I reached my house I sort of stood in the back yard with the dog and stared at the object in the sky.  I thought well this is a star.  So I took another walk around the block. To my amazement the bright white light seemed to follow us always to the right of us.  Was this only a star and it wasn't really moving, but we were.  Then as I got halfway into my second loop around, another bright light came towards us. I came so very close and I kept looking up in the sky thinking I would hear the sound of an engine or something, but nothing.  There were blue and green lights also and then just as it seemed to reach us, it took off over the horizon.  There was no one else around at the time and when I came home I felt exhausted and quite sure no on would believe me but I did relate the story to my two daughters.  The strangest part of all was that I was not scared and I usually scare very easily.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851
Fast white light horizon to horizon 10 seconds flat;2004-03-15 19:45:00;10-12 seconds;Fast white light horizon to horizon 10 seconds flat I was driving east on US 30 in Lancaster County just east of Lancaster city around 1945 local time. A white light caught my eye first from the upper left side of my windshield and proceeded towards the southeast. It was not as high as jet liner traffic and appeared about as high as a cessna would fly, or it was very far away. The sky was clear. This light traveled from the west north west side of the highway towards the southeast until it was out of my sight in about 10 to 12 seconds. I've never seen anything fly so fast it's speed was comparable to a meteorite and I first thought that was what it was, but it had no tail and did not burn out. The light did not flicker or change intensity, it remained the same until it was out of sight in the southeast. I immediately grabbed the cb radio microphone and said did anyone else see that and someone else said they saw it also and never saw anything go across the sky so fast.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851

First spotted one light with a trail of bright light behind it and thought maybe it was a shooting star. As I watched it move across the sky, it flew very quickly over our heads and as it got closer I saw that there were actually 5 of these lights all moving together in a line.

Marching Band loving light follows the patterns of the band.;2007-08-10 19:30:00;15 min.;Marching Band loving light follows the patterns of the band. As funny as it may seem and to the best of my memory it was during band camp.  As the band was standing in form at attention, something caught my peripheral vision above my head. I lifted my head and very distant in the sky I saw a series of stars. At the time I was taking a physics class and I knew which were stars and what was not. Any way I saw a swirling blue and yellow light between 2 stars in the sky. I was able to study the movement because the marching band was receiving a lecture and we were not permitted to move. I gazed at the blue-yellow light and recognized the pattern, it had seemed to be forming the same shapes as the marching band below it. At that time I grabbed the closest person and pointed in the direction of the light. Without describing what I saw, I had asked them if they see anything. The person had responded, Is that star moving? another person noticed and looked up as well. I was able to get the whole band to look without saying a word and they all saw what I saw. The band is multi-racial, and they all noticed. Apparently it spooked the directors, because I heard the tremble in their voices. Of course some of them were in denial and said it was a satellite, but those move in straight lines, and there much more distant and dim. Others said it might have been an airplane, as they said that, an airplane flew under it. I said, No, my friend, that right there is an airplane, whatever that is, is not  The light that I have described from where I was standing appeared to be 2 centimeters in diameter. It was much brighter and closer than any star in the sky that night. It was close enough to see that it was moving. It didn't leave until the band practice was over. It appeared as though it was seeking entertainment from the marching band. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851
Bright star like object near Jupiter disappeared in a mist like ball of light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 21:54:00;10-15 sec;Bright star like object near Jupiter disappeared in a mist like ball of light. At 21:54 EST my wife and I noted a bright, star like object that had 2 fuzzy cones of light coming from below it.  The fuzzy mist like projections faded to just a fuzzy light ball in the sky as the bright light disappeared.  It was located in the South East near Jupiter.  The star like object was brighter in magnitude than Jupiter. It almost looked like a helicopter with a bright spotlight shining down descending through clouds.  The sky was clear during the event.

But it just dimmed dramatically, i could still make it out, then it got brighter, and as it dimmed again it shot strait down, i don't know where, i am located around yti center ville rd, mountville pa, and i  saw this bright circular object shoot down once, then stay stationary, but dim, repeatedly,  4 maybe 5 times,and then get really bright, than the person i was on the phone with (a relative a called a yelled to go out and look in the sky) told me they saw it, but i, at this time lost sight of it again, so it must have moved, she said it blinked and than went behind a cloud, not bright, but visible and wasnt seen again..oh and i didnt see if it touched the ground or not ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright  light seen over SE PA.;2013-06-01 02:40:00;20-30 seconds;Bright  light seen over SE PA. A bright white light crossing the sky caught my attention. The object was moving at a steady pace south to north.  It was round, and about the size of Venus, a little larger, and noticeably brighter.  It did not blink, flash, make noise, or change color.  About 20 degrees east another light, possibly a meteor, flashed across the low horizon.  At that moment the light stopped, paused for about a second, and started moving east. The angle of path change was about 90 degrees, possibly minutely obtuse.  The speed was slower after this.  At this point I ran to get my brother to have another witness, but the object was gone by our return.  We waited for 10 minutes, but the object did not come back into view.  It is the third object I have observed in that area, but I did not report the other two.  This object bears a resemblance to the first I saw in that area, about two years ago.  That object moved in similar way, but slower.  It also changed color from white, to red, to g! reen, back to white, to blue, and back to red.  That object moved in a sporadic zigzag for about 15 minutes before shooting up at great speed.  Both these objects and another were seen within a half mile of each other, and all three times what appear to be meteors have fallen during or just before the sighting.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851

Images of neon blue lights taken outside of restaurant in Lancaster, PA.  ((anonymous report));2018-03-12 19:47:00;Few seconds;Images of neon blue lights taken outside of restaurant in Lancaster, PA Hadn't seen anything personally while taking photos of snowfall outside of Infinito's (pizza buffet), but when I went back through my gallery this morning I saw that I had captured some peculiar lights amongst the falling snow.  Appearing to travel from right to left, these neon lights didn't seem to match the color of any signage from the surrounding area, nor was it emanating from any nearby police vehicles (no cars were being used anywhere nearby for that matter).  Finally, because the pictures had been taken from outside the restaurant (top of awning visible in first photo), there was no possibility of it being reflected from anything inside the restaurant. I'm a 20 year old college student who has taken a few digital photography courses, but I've never captured anything as unusual as this.  It would be something beyond my capabilities as a photographer to stage the photos using an editing program because of the snow that covers the image.  I've never taken drugs/used alcohol, but I was feeling a bit disoriented (I had accidentally taken the bus a stop past mine and had to backtrack a mile and a half to my destination).  I'm looking to keep my identity anonymous, so I have nothing to gain from reporting the experience, and I myself am not a believer in these sorts of things, but having a first hand experience that I can't rationalize perplexes me.   The only reason that I'm taking time to report the incident is that I feel it could be explained by someone more qualified, or else useful to the people that keep track of these strange occurrences.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851

A light ship disappears over Lancaster, PA.;2018-10-03 20:45:00;10-15 seconds;A Light ship disappears over Lancaster, PA. I went out to my back yard to look for my cat.  I received a pair of night vision goggles for Christmas for sky watching, so I brought them with me to help find the cat.  It was a clear beautiful night, so I started looking at the stars.   After 3 or 4 minutes I saw what I thought was a satellite traveling west to east.  I quickly realized it was too big, too bright, traveling too slow and it was flying way too low to be a satellite.  I watched it as it traveled straight over my head.  I pull the goggles away and could not see it with the naked eye.  It started to get a little bit brighter and then faded away and just disappeared.  As it was fading away it became transparent before disappearing. ((NUFORC Note:  The object was not the ISS, which was visible from the witness's location at 8:47 p.m. (local), but which was visible in the extreme northern sky.  Also, not an Iridium flare.
