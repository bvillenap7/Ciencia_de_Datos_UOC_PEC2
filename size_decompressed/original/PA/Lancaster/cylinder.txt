cylindrical shaped craft hovering next to Amish farm house;2003-01-25 17:05:00;2 minutes;cylindrical shaped craft hovering next to Amish farm house I am writing this for my mother who witnessed a cigar shaped craft near New Providence, PA.   She was on her way to visit my brother for his birthday when she saw what she thought was an aircraft about to crash in a nearby Amish farm field.  Suddenly the craft came to a halt near the Amish home and hovered there for about a minute or two.   My mom then drove past the Amish home and said the craft continued to hover next to the house.  It was grayish in appearance, had no windows,made no noise, however it did appear to have heat coming out of the tail of the craft. As she continued past the craft it suddenly accelerated and disappeared within a few seconds. My mom waited several months to tell us because she thought we would think she was crazy.
