Birght continual white light object at high altitude;2003-06-04 21:30:00;2 minutes;Birght continual white light object at high altitude From my deck I saw a continual bright white light (about magnitude -3.0) moving slowly (but probably at high speed at high altitude) to the northeast through the southeast/east portion of our sky.  It was high altitude as there was a hazy halo effect from high thin clouds this evening.  There was no sound.  This was not a satellite flare as it was continual and maintained it's brightness even as it crossed lower to the northeast.  I am very familiar with satellites in my regular observations including the ISS, as well as commercial and even military air traffic passing.  This had no characteristics of those craft.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851

It resembled a star exactly except that it glided through the sky it was NOT a plane however.  It was white and mildly bright.  It did not twinkle.   My friends and I watched it for approximately ten minutes before it flew south, towards a more light-polluted part of the sky and was no longer visible.

4 witness confirmation on another's sighting;2011-06-01 22:30:00;5-10 min;4 witness confirmation on anothers sighting A few weeks ago i was outside with 2 friends at around 10:30pm.  we saw what looked like an abnormally large star.  within a minute it started to move.  whatever this was, it was further up in the sky than anything I have ever seen prior, yet it was moving much faster than typical aircraft.  i left my friends watching it while i ran inside to get my boyfriend.   a minute later we joined my friends just in time to witness this thing stopped moving, then the light dimmed and it vanished. being a bit freaked out by this I have been searching the net to see if anyone else has reported seeing this in my area.  I'm not sure where the lady who wrote the following is from but if she lives near Lancaster, PA, i confirm her report with my own. Occurred : 6/29/2011 22:00 (Entered as : 06/29/11 22:00) Reported: 6/29/2011 9:00:34 PM 21:00 Posted: 7/4/2011 Location: Jeannette, PA Shape: Light Duration:2 minutes Silent light heading over night sky    As I was walking to my car from my house to lock it up for the night, I glanced back to the east-southeast direction.  I noticed it was a very clear night, and saw what I thought to be Jupiter, simply because it was the most prominent object in the sky.  I glanced at it for a second or two, then proceeded to my car. As I finished replacing the floor mats in my car and locking it up, I then proceeded to walk back towards the house, once again looking up in the sky in a east-southeasterly direction.  I noticed that the object that I assumed to be Jupiter, was now moving in a westerly direction at a speed similar to commercial aircraft. However, the main reason I believe this was a UFO, was because the light was much more prominent than any aircraft lights, and there were no marker lights on the wings (red and blue commonly seen).  There was also absolutely no sound. I tracked the object for about two minutes until our trees got in the way. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

((HOAX??))  Orange light moving in night sky.;2014-05-05 01:15:00;2mins;Orange light moving in night sky. I saw a quick moving spherical shape moving across the night sky with an object orbiting it. (Could be mistaken for a light but looked more like something for centrifugal propulsion)  I chased after it but I was way too quick.  Luckily someone else saw it in their car.

They flickered as they gliding through the sky and they went left to right. They ended up fading away once they went behind the trees.  My uncle ran to go get us and we freaked out and tried to record.  i got it but its very faint and i only got the last one. the last one stopped in the sky and went up to go over a tree.  Soon after, we all heard sirens from an alarm system and cop sirens.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851
Silver and shiny, round and large.;2019-10-05 10:00:00;20 minutes;Silver and shiny, round and large. Yesterday, October 5th, Myself and my mother watched a circular silver object just sit in the sky over our house.  My mother first spotted it while watching the planes.  She was shown an app that tracks all the planes and you can see all of its info and is now addicted.  So watching planes she noticed the object.  After a few minutes she texted me to come up to the porch and look at something.  I laid back on a chair and began watching with my mother. I quickly grabbed my phone and began filming.  I will apologize right now for when it is out of focus or a little shaky. This object looked not so far away, but then you would see a plane thats at 38,000ft pass between me and the object.  Very silver, very shiny, very round.  This thing must have been fairly large.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851
