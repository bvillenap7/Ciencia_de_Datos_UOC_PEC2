Silver oval/ball streaks across the sky, stops and moves on out of site.;2002-08-15 17:00:00;20;Silver oval/ball streaks across the sky, stops and moves on out of site. I do not remember the exact date and time but it was during the month of August of 2002 the time was between 1630 to 1730. I was working outside in the back yard and looked up to see a silver sphere. The object was in the north and it was flying in the eastward direction.  The object was moving to fast to be a civilian plane or a commercial plane at the altitude that I was looking at. I would have seen some type of wings, the rate at which the object was flying was extremely fast which is what got my attention other wise I would have just dismissed it as a plane that was going to land at the airport given the time of day.  The object came across the sky and then stop for about 5 seconds from the angle that I was view the object would have put it just south of the Lancaster airport but still in the airspace of the airport. The object was stationary for about five seconds then started to move east again slowly and then just took off out of my view to fast for my eyes to follow. When I first spotted the object it was a silver dot and as it moved closer the object started to take shape I could see that it was an sphere and the object was silver in color. It was definitely not an airplane. There were no lights that I could see. I just discover this site 4/22/03 and would have reported it sooner had I known about it to have give the exact times and dates. I donâ€™t know if or even how to find out if the airport had a track on the object or even if they keep a record of it. But that would be my proof of the event if they did.

My window of view was small only a small patch of sky but I saw it clearly it was large and not extremely fast but fast.   Not a plane blimp or balloon but weird.    ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and credible.  The object was reported to be blue, and moving rapidly.

Changing color sphere emitted black smoke/mist into atmosphere.;2019-09-15 17:30:00;5 minutes;Changing color sphere emitted black smoke/mist into atmosphere. The 2 of us noticed a sphere over the western part of Lancaster hovering and slowly moving eastward.  We thought it was a ballon but it flashed different colors and emitted a black mist that quickly disappeared in the atmosphere.   I did take video but not sure if I got all of the action.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851
Red/Orange Orbs Observed in Cabbage Hill;2020-03-08 20:00:00;1 minutes;Red/Orange Orbs Observed in Cabbage Hill At approximately 10pm I observed a red/orange orb or sphere traveling right to left above the horizon. i was in my back yard, i noticed a 2nd then 3rd orb, one following the next.  i called my cousin out into the yard to see it also.  we noticed there was no contrail, it was a clear sky and cloudless night, the moon was visible, as well as contrails from other aircraft at higher altitudes. I couldn't tell if the 3 lights were connected or part of one craft or if it was 3 separate craft.  what i did take notice to was it was absolute silent, there were no strobe lights, although there where aircraft (single engine) that were in the area, i could hear them and see their strobes. The orbs disappeared behind a building.  the sighting was between strawberry street and filbert street in Lancaster pa.  When they where no longer in view i checked the time it was 10:10pm/20:10hrs .;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851
