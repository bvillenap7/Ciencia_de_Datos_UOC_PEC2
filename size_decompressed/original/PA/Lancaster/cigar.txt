Object appears to be cigar shaped with a cone on the top. The object in question appeared in one of the photos that were taken on July 19th at Dutch Wonderland Amusement Park in Lancaster PA.  The approximate time was 6:18pm and the sky was clear without cloud cover.  The camera was in the process of taking a series of photos in the sports mode (six pictures in three seconds) and the object being photographed was the top of the log flume ride. As you look at the photos, you can see that the log car is just approaching the top of the ride and makes very little progress through the duration of the six photos.  The first two photos appear normal, but in the third photo the object appears in the top left hand corner.  I am not making any claims about what it is I just found the object to be unusual. As I tried to blow the picture up, the object appeared to be cigar shaped with a cone on the top.  The cone appears to be centered on the cigar and reflecting light, as if it was metallic. I would appreciate someone to look at the photo and give me an opinion as to what it may possibly be.  I am sure that you may have the capability to enhance the photo for more clarification.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851

It was heading north,  then moved horizontally to the west.  The it moved east.  It then seemed to lower a bit, and looked cigar shaped.  This continued for the 15 minutes that I was outside.  It was still there when I went back inside.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851
