I was becoming very relaxed and staring at the sky.   After a while, I clearly saw a huge amount of UFO vehicles flying in all directions.  I could never make this up or imagine the detail that  I saw.  The ships ranged from Huge and slow moving to smaller ones that would shoot faster through the sky.  It was like really congested and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  I had no mind altering drugs or alcohol.  Never will forget it..

Now at first I didn’t think much of it until I got a better / closer look & then I noticed that the star like object on the left began to slowly fade out & as soon it did other one faded & dimmed out as well.  The impression I got was that these two star like objects were a part of one object which was completely stationary & not moving from my vantage point.  I would say that it was probably around where normal planes fly in feet but it looked like it was completely still & not moving.  I consider myself a trained observer & I can tell you that this was not your typical airplane or helicopter.;40.044591594203;-76.3206420289851
