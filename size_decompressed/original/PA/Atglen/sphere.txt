Two glowing spheres one quickly moving into a cloud, the other remained stationary for an extended time.;2005-03-08 22:00:00;Over an hour;Two glowing spheres one quickly moving into a cloud, the other remained stationary for an extended time. Two objects were visible in the night sky. They were circular having three lights one bright blue light on the top.  Two red lights each side.  The center light was white.  One of the spheres quickly moved inside cloud cover and the other remained stationary.  As the car approached closer and closer to the remaining sphere it was still stationary with no noise from the craft.  Did not stay near the craft out of fear from the outcome.   This report is from a friend.  I would not have sent this report but another sighting 2 days later from a different individual describing the same type spheres this time as three were seen at 12:00am several miles from the first sighting in the same county.  The spheres appeared higher in the sky and did not move.;39.9473;-75.9746
