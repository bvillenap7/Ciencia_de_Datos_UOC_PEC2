Extremely bright light contained in a pyramid shape high in the early morning sky.;2020-10-17 04:30:00;10 minutes;Extremely bright light contained in a pyramid shape high in the early morning sky. I went outside to warm my car up and noticed a intensely bright white light in the northeastern horizon about a third of the way up into the sky. The light was pure white and extremely bright, like a pure white LED bulb. The light was not close to the land. At first I thought it might be Venus or another star, but it moved slightly and I had never seen a star in that position in the sky or at that magnitude. As I watched it, I noticed there were at least three other dimmer lights around it, and it looked like the lights formed a pyramid shape with this brighter light. I don't know if these lights were part of the first light or were separate entities. As I watched, another dimmer white light approached the first group of lights from the north and I lost sight of it behind or among the other lights. I had to leave and didn't see what happened to them. I checked the same area in the sky the next morning, but everything appeared normal.;39.9473;-75.9746
