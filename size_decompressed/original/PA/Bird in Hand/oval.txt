I noticed more appear and they seemed to fly in formation. Some appeared to speed up and slow back down.  They made no noise and traveled almost due South from the North. It almost appeared as if they were being launched or taking off in rabid rates from an unknown location.  There is an airport in the town called Smoketown Airport I thought perhaps they were launching from here so I drove 3 minutes down the road to the airport and it was closed. No signs off any people or vehicles.  I have no explantion for what I saw.  The lights remained solid orange and their was no blinking warning lights like on typical aircraft.;40.0569;-76.1814
