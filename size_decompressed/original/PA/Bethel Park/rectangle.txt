Rectangular object, highly reflective in late afternoon sky above suburban Pittsburgh;2019-05-18 17:15:00;3 minutes;Rectangular object, highly reflective in late afternoon sky above suburban Pittsburgh I was sitting on my deck in the late afternoon when I noticed an extremely bright white object stationary in the sky above.  There were scattered cumulus clouds and the sky was bright blue. I watched the object for about a minute and became very curious when it seemed to not be moving.  It appeared to be higher than aircraft coming in to land at the Pittsburgh airport and above the cloud deck.  The object was east / northeast of Bethel Park, my deck faces east. I went inside and retrieved a pair of binoculars which I keep handy for bird watching.  I was able to observe the object for about five seconds.  It appeared to be rectangular and highly reflective white / silver. Immediately after that, it was obscured by a cloud which passed in front of it.  Once the cloud passed, the object was gone.;40.3214;-80.0378
