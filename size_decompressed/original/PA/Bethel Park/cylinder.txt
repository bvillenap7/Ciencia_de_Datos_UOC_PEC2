We didn't pay attention until he said, 'look, it's on fire'.   We turned and saw this tubular image with a red tail of light soar across the sky at a slow rate.  My daughter was already holding the camera and took the footage.   It moved upward than SW at a steady speed, never dropping until it cleared from sight.
