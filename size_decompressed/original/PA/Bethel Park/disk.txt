It was 7:53pm on September 7,2005 I was on my way home from work when I noticed a flashing light in the night sky. I continued to drive my way home(roughly about five mins of the sighting itself) and noticed it was blinking on and off like a tower for the airplanes but this was white and steady on and off not red like they normally are. As I got closer home I was able to stop (due to the red lights and examine it closer)it was moving very slow across the sky. Once it was getting closer I could see the colors started to change. They went from red to green to blue to white again but each one flashed a different way.I could tell by now that there was no wings like and airplane. I also know it wasnt a blimp- that would have been closer to me and I know it wasnt a helicopter either that too would have been closer.I have never seen anything like it before. When I got home I tried to see it again but it was no where to be found.;40.3214;-80.0378
