5 Red pulsating lights in the sky over Bethel Park, PA on Christmas Eve 2013.;2013-12-24 19:00:00;3 minutes;5 Red pulsating lights in the sky over Bethel Park, PA on Christmas Eve 2013 On Christmas Eve (2013) I witnessed 5 red glowing/pulsating lights around 730 pm in the Bethel Park area in the south hills of Pgh, PA.  I was loading my kids Christmas into our car, preparing to leave my in-laws house.  After witnessing the lights, in stunned curiousity I yelled for my wife to come out, by that time she witnessed one light, as they were moving quickly through the sky.  I know they weren't planes flying in formation they were way too red and relatively close together.  Very strange event.;40.3214;-80.0378
