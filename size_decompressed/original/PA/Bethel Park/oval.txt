I looked  up at the sky and it was cloudy.  There where 4 oval shaped lights in the clouds going in circles very fast.  The lights never crossed paths and the light did not radiate out of the clouds.  All 4 lights moved in their own  exact same circle over and over, never crossing and maintaining the same speed.  My daughter stated she noticed them with the person she was with had dropped her off.  We watched them for about 5 minutes and then went inside.
