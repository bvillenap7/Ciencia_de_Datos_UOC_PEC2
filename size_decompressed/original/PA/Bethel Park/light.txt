bright light moving slowly that dimmed out and disappeared.;2004-08-22 21:00:00;about 5 seconds;bright light moving slowly that dimmed out and disappeared On Sunday night, my husband and I were lying in the backyard on a comforter watching the stars.  It was well after dark.   I happened to turn my head and saw a bright star-like object approaching very slowly from the east, northeast.   I said, Look at that.   It was continuing on its straight course, with no blinking lights and no sound.   About a second or so later it began to grow dimmer and dimmer and then just disappeared.  I would compare it to someone trimming a kerosene lamp and then extinguishing it.   It was a clear night, no clouds, so it couldn't have flown into a cloud bank.  We searched the skies with our eyes and binoculars but it had vanished.   It was going too slow to be a meteor and left no trail.  It was as bright as Venus, but slowly moving, and did not alter course at all. ((NUFORC Note:  If the estimate of direction is accurate, the object probably was not a satellite, since only very few satellites fly to the west.  PD));40.3214;-80.0378
4 red lights, with some white, in a sharp triangle formation with the 4th light in front of the point. No sound moving slowly.;2012-08-28 21:30:00;2 minutes;4 red lights, with some white, in a sharp triangle formation with the 4th light in front of the point. No sound moving slowly. I saw 4 red, with some white, lights in the West sky of Bethel Park traveling VERY slowly from North to South in a sharp pointed triangle formation with the 4th light forming a needle pointer at the triangle's point. No sound! They did not appear to be very high in the sky. I watched them for about 2 minutes as they disappeared over the trees' horizon.;40.3214;-80.0378
I was looking up at the big dipper, and to the left of the end of the handle, I witnessed a light slightly dimmer than the nearest star;2020-10-03 20:00:00;2 minutes;I was looking up at the big dipper, and to the left of the end of the handle, I witnessed a light slightly dimmer than the nearest stars that moved slowly toward the south in a straight line. I thought it was a satellite until it abruptly made a 90 degree turn toward the East, then continued in that direction at the same speed until I could no longer track it through the trees. I have been stargazing in this part of my yard for 5 years, and have never seen anything like this. It appeared to be a yellowish star-sized light that moved purposefully, yet V at a medium pace for approximately 2 minutes, then it seemed to flash slightly, and immediately turn 90 degrees toward the south. It looked like a smaller light remained at the point where the larger light made the 90 degree turn. It remained for about 10 seconds, and then slowly dimmed out. Meanwhile the primarily light continued in a southward direction in a straight line for at least another minute until I ! lost it in some trees. I dont know if this was a true ufo sighting, as it could have been some sort of astrological event However,  I have not been able to find any articles describing an event of any kind taking place tonight, Saturday,  October 3rd, 2020 it is now 8:17pm and I witnessed the light from approximately 7:59pm to 8:05pm ET (southwest Pennsylvania);40.3214;-80.0378
