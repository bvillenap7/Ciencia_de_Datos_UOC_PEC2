I was setting off fireworks with some of my friends on a summer evening. For some reason I was compelled to look up in the sky. Supprised and happy I finally saw a UFO. The craft did not move or make any sound that I heard in the 3 seconds I saw It. I looked away to tell some of my friends to look and they asked me where it was. It was gone, it disapeared in the 2 seconds I looked away. In the Sky, it was about 2 inches long. It was an oval on its side. The highth was about half an inch. There was no lights flashing, the whole craft was glowing metalic orange, perhaps the 'Stealth' of it was reflected from the setting sun.  Amazing!;40.9259;-75.9161
