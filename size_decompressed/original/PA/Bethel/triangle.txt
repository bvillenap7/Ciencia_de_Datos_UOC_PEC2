I noticed a super reflective shiny object in the southern sky.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-29 19:25:00;1 minute;My son and I were on our way to Kauffman's BBQ chicken ranch we turned off of Route 78 Westbound and got on to Old 22.  I noticed a super reflective shiny object in the southern sky  I slowed down and told my son look at that what's that it appeared almost triangular shape with the top of the triangle pointing at 3 oclock in the sky.  The thing that was most observable was that it was like a mirror reflecting the Setting Sun at 7:25 in the evening.  It was so shiny silver and reflective and it wasn't a plane and within maybe 15 to 20 seconds of observing this my son says look look did you see that and this thing in the sky shot up at not quite at 90 degree angle maybe 80 degrees and disappeared.  There were no clouds in the sky...it was a blue sky and it was just gone and within another 20 sec we were parked at the restaurant and we were looking everywhere to see if it was a plane where would it have gone if it was a helicopter but it was nothing like that.  It was almost as if it saw us watching it and it just shot up and disappeared. it was definitely something that I could not identify there was no sound I put my window down in the car and the fact that it was just gone within seconds of looking at it was unbelievable.  it wasn't long like a plane.
