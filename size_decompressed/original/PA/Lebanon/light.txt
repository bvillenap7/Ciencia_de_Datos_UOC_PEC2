Two dim yellow lights moving very quickly;2007-01-21 21:30:00;5 seconds;Two dim yellow lights moving very quickly Saw two dim yellow-amber lights about 30 degrees above horizon. F irst saw the two lights due south and moving from west to east very quickly.  Moved too quickly for helicopter or commercial craft. Thought might be two military fighters with after-burners, but for distance covered in such short time period I should have heard the engine noise. Maybe satellites, but two next to each other? Did China perform their Anti-ballistic missle defense test?;40.3386481927711;-76.4132506024096
Bright white non-blinking star-like lights began moving across Lebanon,Pa. night sky.;2013-06-14 23:01:00;9 minutes;Bright white non-blinking star-like lights began moving across Lebanon,Pa. night sky. Staring out at the night sky, the stars and planets are pretty easy to spot tonight, however two stars that were just sitting still and somewhat bright one a few minutes after the other began to move very slowly at first then picked up speed the fist one went to the west than seemed to head deeper into space til it was out of sight, the other did the same but headed southward heading but move deeper into to space, both made subtle course changes, and both gave off a bright steady field of light and both just prior to heading deeper out to space seemed to get noticeably brighter and much faster. The time of the first was 11:01pm the second was 11:08pm, further note several flashes and what sounded like lightning booms from just over the horizon to the west but no storms on any weather maps passing bye us during a completely clear night sky, note that both objects looked like one of the stars just sitting in place up in the night sky, then I noticed the first began to move slightly out of place from the other stars then began picking speed.  The second didn't begin to move until the first one had move off to what looked like further into space til I was no longer to  make out it's motion, but just prior to it moving off like I mentioned it seemed to get much brighter than it was gone.  The same thing happened with the second, they both made subtle course changes as well, so I new they weren't meteors. but the first I can say was just sitting there for 23 minutes before it began to move, I almost didn't notice it til I began to look at some other stars just to the right! of it.  The second one was actually kind of cluster with 5 other stars or lights but after I'd watched the second one move off I turned to look back at where it had first seemed positions and the other lights/stars it had been clustered near were gone as well, almost as if they had just faded slowly unnoticeably further out to space or just dimmed out.  Also, wanted to note again, the sky here was completely cloudless and clear with no storms passing near my position on any weather maps I'd checked from Accuweather and my WeatherChannel apps.;40.3386481927711;-76.4132506024096
