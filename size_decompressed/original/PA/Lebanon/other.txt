I lingered at the same spot for another five minutes to see if the object would reappear,  it did not and i continued into the other building. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that high-altitude contrails, illuminated by the rising Sun, are possibilities that would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the object the witness saw was a UFO.   NUFORC receives reports very similar to this one at times that are close to sunset, and sunrise.  PD));40.3386481927711;-76.4132506024096
