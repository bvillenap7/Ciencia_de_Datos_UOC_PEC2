Two dimly lit spherical objects, moving at a fast speed, observed in Lebanon, PA.;2012-09-10 22:20:00;10 seconds;Two dimly lit spherical objects, moving at a fast speed, observed in Lebanon, PA. I live in a third floor apartment, with a door the leads to the roof of the building. Tonight, I went out around 22:15 to smoke.  I noticed a plane in the very clear night sky. In my peripheral vision, I saw movement that I thought, initially, to be a shooting star. I looked in the direction of that movement, and saw nothing at first, until I notice movement again.  I kept looking at the area, and saw something moving in my direction.  As it got closer, I was able to, very clearly, see two dimly lit spheres moving at a very fast speed.  The spheres were flying very close to each other, roughly 50 feet next to each other, possibly closer.  The light coming from them was dark yellow to orange in color. I continued to follow the objects across the sky moving towards the aforementioned plane, which was now almost directly above me, but on a higher level in the sky than the spheres. I watched the spheres pass underneath the plane, a distance of about 2,000 to 3,000 fe! et, and zip over my house and out of sight. There was no sound associated with these objects, even at the speed they were moving. The spheres themselves were about 300 to 500 feet above me. The entire event lasted roughly 30 seconds.;40.3386481927711;-76.4132506024096
Bright white spheres remaining stationary in the daytime sky above our home.;2019-10-05 13:30:00;>1 hour;Bright white spheres remaining stationary in the daytime sky above our home. We saw two round bright white objects in the daytime sky.  They did not move from the spots above our house, for more than 45 minutes.  They looked very small due to how high in the sky they were.  My husband has pictures of them on our digital camera.  One did appear to split in half, then the two parts merged back together, it happened within a second of the split.  The other moved a little closer.  At times it appeared that the spheres had tails, but would always resume their spherical shape, and did not move from their positions in the sky.  When an airplane was moving in their direction, they moved out of the way of the airplane, then back to their original position.  In one of the pictures that my husband took, it appears that there is a line of lights down the center of the sphere.;40.3386481927711;-76.4132506024096
