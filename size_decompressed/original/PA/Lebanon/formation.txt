Three reddish orange lights flying in formation over Lebanon, PA;2012-05-12 21:30:00;About five minutes;Three reddish orange lights flying in formation over Lebanon, PA About 21:30, my mother noticed unusual lights visible above the trees across the road in the western sky and asked me what I thought they were.  My father, mother and I went out to look and saw three reddish orange lights flying more or less in a row.  They were bright and appeared to be about the same brightness and size as Venus. It was a still night, but we couldn’t hear any sound.  They flew towards the northeast and were visible for about five minutes before they passed one at a time into or over a cloud.  It wasn’t possible to determine how high they were flying.  They seemed to be flying about as fast as a typical plane does and weren’t flying in an unusual fashion. My mother and I thought that there was a single light associated with each object.  My father thought there might have been three lights, but all a reddish orange hue.  He also felt that the objects were oriented diagonally to the ground.  The lights didn’t blink. I had wondered initially if they might be fire balloons, but after watching them, I felt that they were moving like guided craft, not subject to a breeze.  They seemed to maintain an even spacing throughout the time they were in view. I am a biologist, my mother is a retired nurse and my father is a retired aeronautical engineer who worked with carrier based jets and marking and lighting systems.;40.3386481927711;-76.4132506024096
A silent string formation,8-10 amber lights traveling at an angle and making a snake movement as it changed direction before vanishing.;2013-03-09 23:40:00;10 seconds;A silent string formation,8-10 amber lights traveling at an angle and making a snake movement as it changed direction before vanishing. I was taking my dog out approximately at 23:40. I looked up at the big dipper and saw 8-10 faintly amber lights in a string formation heading easterly. They appeared to be very high and made no sound. Approximate length was about the distance from the top of the big dipper to the bottom. They were traveling east at a slant, with the right side leading. After they traveled a good distance they began to head south and the whole formation followed the right leading light and almost made a snake type movement before they then again started heading south east and then faded. The sky was dark as there was no moon and my neighborhood was not very bright with exterior lights that night .;40.3386481927711;-76.4132506024096
