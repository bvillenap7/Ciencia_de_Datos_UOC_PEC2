It was about 10:30-10:45 pm and we were driving down Cumberland St at the intersection of Lincoln Avenue when we saw the fireball light in the sky.   First saw it moving upwards, then remained steady and then started traveling in a straight direction. We followed it and kept pace with it (it was then all but directly above us but all the way in the sky).  After turning down a couple streets to continue following it, it elevated higher in the sky and just vanished.  It was a bright orange-y color and almost glowed or had a slight flicker to it.;40.3386481927711;-76.4132506024096
