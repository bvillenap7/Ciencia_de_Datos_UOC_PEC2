We were driving home from eating (My stepmom, my dad, and I), when I saw what I thought was a star iin the sky. I soon noticed that it was awfully bright and in an area where no other stars were. I kept an eye on it, and it wasnt doing anything, then all of the sudden, it started going quicklystraight upward. In a few seconds, it had dissapeared from sight.;40.3857;-75.7723
