((anonymous report));2017-04-12 01:00:00;1 minute;Last year, i woke up in the middle of the nite with a weird looking flesh tone grey shape leaning down touching my right side.  I got really sick the next day i was addmitted to hospital with renal failure.  There was no explanation as to why my kidney's were faling. Three months later, my gallbladder had to be removed.  Dr said it was unusual for gallbladders to spas and put poison into the body. A few weeks later, in the middle of the nite, i felt someone thouching my side i awoke to hear a women and sence another.  The one women said she was there to check my kidneys. I looked towards the voice and saw nothing i awoke that morning feeling weird like something was still there. On the 12th of this month, i was in hospital with bronchitis and stopped breathing.  I also have sores on my arms legs and feet and loosing my hair. I am a very young man.  I got out of the hospital and that night heard a womans voice.  She said i am leaving now please take care of yourself. The encounters with the women were peaceful and felt peaceful.
