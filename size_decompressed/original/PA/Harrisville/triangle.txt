A friend and I were walking up a dirt road, when we got to the top of a small hill.  Three lights in a triangle lit up just above a telephone pole.   I remember it made no sound and did not move.  The only other thing I remember is running home. I can't remember even telling my parents.   Years later, I seen my childhood friend that was with me and asked him if he remembered that night.  He did but that was it.  We never talked about it again.   I wish I could remember more about that night or have a chance to see them again, now that I'm older.   Every time I see a program about ufo's I think a about that night.  I know we're not alone. Nobody can tell me different.
