We witnessed an object(only one) which we first thought was a falling star however, it seemed to be moving slower than a falling star.  It was the same shape, size and brightness of the stars around it.  It was directly above the handle of the big dipper.  It started to move downward then quickly changed directions and then we lost it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.7984;-80.455
