Approx. 10 to 15 appeared between 150 to 300 feet above me and a three story building.  Look like a giant round but oval with a tail fluid object about 4 to 5 feet in circumference.  They stayed in a formation but mingled among each other while moving among each other while another trailed not to distant.  Middle of the body was real bright daylight white while the outer body translucent white.  But the glow didn't light up the sky. When trying to take a photo, they speed up and disappeared rapidly.  This was in no doubt a living, flying object.  These fluid looking objects moved in such a way as if they were communicating but flew like a school of fish surrounding your body.  Without a doubt, they were not drones. I own a couple of drones and not even the best drone could fly and maneuver the ! way they did, in unison as if they were in an invisible capsule themselves.  I have empirically no doubt that we live among aliens. No doubt. And nothing can change how strongly I feel.  You have absolutely no idea how close they were to me.  And here is the kicker, I small Chinese woman appeared out of nowhere from the middle of a pitch black dead end road.  I am 100% positive the US government and alike across this world seen this object.  If the object flew right next to me, it probably would be the equivalent of a large SUV but in diameter.;41.0542;-75.6331
