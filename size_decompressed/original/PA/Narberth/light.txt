Meteor like object followed by two black helicopters 15 minutes later on October 14th 2008.;2008-10-14 17:30:00;20 sec;Meteor like object followed by two black helicopters 15 minutes later on October 14th 2008. We were driving and noticed in the sky a bright fireball light streaking across the sky. We saw it for about 10 seconds. It was very low, lower then any other meteors witnessed in the past. My initial reaction was that it was possibly a meteor and we just dismissed it as such. However, 15 minutes later when we got to my house I noticed two black objects approaching directly under the almost full moon. As the objects got closer we noticed that they were black helicopters. We also noticed that they both had only a small red light on their undersides. They moved quickly over head and went west. It took me about twenty seconds to realize that they were heading in the same direction as the meteor like object that we saw just 15 minutes before. We put two and two together and concluded that the helicopters were probably looking for that object/meteor. We immediately got back into the car and tried to follow the helicopters but without success. This all occurred between 7 pm and 9pm. I did not look at my watch at the time.
