Fireball and moving star;2002-10-08 20:20:00;few seconds;Fireball and moving star I was on my back porch talking to a friend and like I always do on a clear night, gaze into the night sky. I have seen many UFO's. Then it happened, for about two to three seconds a FIREBALL streaked across the sky, from east to west, and disappeared out of my vision. I continued to gaze up when I saw what appeared to be a dim star slowly moving. It suddenly got brighter and brighter until it was a bright star. It then turned west and dimmed, as though it was thundering back into space. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));40.0218;-75.2631
