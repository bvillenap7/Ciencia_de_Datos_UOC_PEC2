On July 11, 2020 at approximately 2200hrs, my son and I were on top of the roof after observing the local fireworks show.  The fireworks had ended 5+ minutes prior to this.   he was positioning his camera towards the constellation of the Big Dipper, in order to photograph comet Neowise, I noticed something moving.  The object, as best as I can describe, was the shape of a stingray as you would see it in the ocean looking at its underbelly from below the stingray.  This object moved quite fast right to left almost directly above us.  My son also then saw the object and turned attempting to photograph it.  I lost sight of the object after only maybe 3 seconds of seeing it move, but he said he saw the object make a turn and back track towards where it came from before losing sight of it.  We both describe the object as almost translucent with no visible lights at all. Earlier I was flying my Typhoon Drone to photograph the fireworks, so the size was similar, but mov! ed much faster, so I am unsure if the object was 300 + feet above us, or higher and larger than the drone, though the speed tells me it was lower. Again this was not a drone or any type of aircraft I have seen in my 44 years on earth or as a police officer for over 20 years. It made no noise, and had no visible wings. The entire episode lasted maybe 3-5 seconds.;40.6312;-76.1738
