Orange firey lights, unexplainable;2011-07-02 01:00:00;5 minutes;Orange firey lights, unexplainable About an hour ago we were outside and 2 large orange lights appeared close together in the sky, no sound, yet they were traveling up.  Looked like the spinner fireworks you set on the ground and they ignite and spin, best way to describe it, like they were on fire.  They traveled UP and at a decent speed, then one fizzled out and continued to rise up with a dimmer light, the other did the same moments later, then from the same direction ANOTHER one came and the same thing, seemed that after the firey light dimmed, they got faster and traveled upwards til they disappeared,   MAN was THIS STRANGE!!!!
