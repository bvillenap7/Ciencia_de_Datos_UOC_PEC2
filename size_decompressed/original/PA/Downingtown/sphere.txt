While waiting for the usual yearly 9 PM fireworks show to start there was an unexplained delay and as the crowd eyes and mind wandered the sky wondering why the delay.  We and many others were getting ready to leave thinking the show may have be cancelled.  We started to get up out of our lawn chairs and in the sky behind us we noticed 4 slowly moving orange craft that were circular moving very slowly pulsating and drifting west to east.  Clearly not normal aircraft my daughter started taking pictures with her IPhone and my wife used her camera. Then the craft had an additional 14 to 18 craft drifting by the field with several families noticing and joking about being UFOâ€™s. We had seen 5 last year at the same place however they did not float by in the same way.  However they just disappeared last year and so did there just go by and then they went into a straight line and disappeared.  They did not shoot away in a flash just simply turned into nothing.  On the way home which was only a 10 minute ride we stopped at a gas station near our home to get some creamer for coffee and my wife went in my daughter and I both could not wait to look at the pictures, What we say gave us chills and goose bumps because when we used her IPhone to get bigger close-ups  the body of the craft were not longer round, but the craft was clearly seen.  All lit up with bright lights like steps all around the craft I am attaching or uploading the best photo we have.  We were hoping to get these to you before the C2C show tonight because I remember last year on the 4th we had reports all over the US with the same orange craft.  I want to say orbs but these are orange round appearing craft.;40.0146;-75.7136
