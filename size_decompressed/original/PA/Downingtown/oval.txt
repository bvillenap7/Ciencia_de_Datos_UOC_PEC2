Round red objects numbering 2 to 4 duration 5 to 10 minutes climbing from the west to the east always in line formation;2012-09-21 21:00:00;3 minutes;Round red objects numbering 2 to 4 duration 5 to 10 minutes climbing from the west to the east always in line formation Standing out back of our house on various nights during July, August  and September 2012, I along with at least 8 other people have at different times have seen red oval shaped objects traveling from the west to the east, always at or after 9 pm est.  They started out in groups of 3 and as they pass overhead we can not make out any sound of an engine.  Only once did we see four and two peeled off heading south while the others continued in a straight line and climbing.  There was some aircraft in the area that night.   One night in late September we saw two come directly over the house and continued upward at a steady pace until out of sight.  One observation is that at the time these lights are seen all of the other aircraft are way out of range.  Lately towards the end of September we only saw them in groups of two.  I have flown in the military and know the identification lights of various aircraft, and these were only red round objects and none of them fit the pattern of normal aircraft.   The most striking thing about these was the fact that they were silent.   This was definitely verified on the last sighting when they flew directly over the house. ((NUFORC Note:  Dates are uncertain.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above for the most recent sighting of the several that the witness apparently has had since July 2012.

Bright white object for 60 minutes observed with high power binoculars. ((anonymous report));2019-10-05 15:00:00;60 minutes;Bright white object for 60 minutes observed with high power binoculars. Exact same one as Huntington valley and Pennsauken one. Stationary in sky at altitude viewed with binoculars for 1 hour.  Btight White object as vieeed. Perfect clear day.  Appeared to be stationary with movement simulated by rotation of earth making it seem like it was moving from magnetic northeast to south toward rising sun position East at 2 hours prior to sunset.  Inital location was 50 degrees from ground at NE with apparent movement south.  The reference altitude from several 40,000 feet jets under it put it at gt 100,000-500,000 or higher feet.  Clear observation with high powered binoculars with distinct shape like donut.  Ruled out weather balloon, ISS, gas, star, moon, several witnesses;40.0146;-75.7136
