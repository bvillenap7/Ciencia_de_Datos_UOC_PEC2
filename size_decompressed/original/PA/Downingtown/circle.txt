Star-like (but MUCH BRIGHTER AND LARGER) light west of D-town, PA.  Seen against sunset.  ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail??  PD));2007-10-10 18:33:00;1 to 1 1/2 minutes;Star-like (but MUCH BRIGHTER AND LARGER) light west of D-town, PA.  Seen against sunset. 	Traveling home from work (west on 322, chester county) it was a beautiful sky with lots of colors and the sun setting before me (10-20% cloud cover, estimate). 	At approximately 6:33 I looked up and noticed a bright white light near the sun and horizon (i believe it was to the right of the sun).  Initially I thought, star/planet based on the color of light, but quickly decided against that thought based on the brightness of the sky at the time, as well as the size and brightness of the light (it was against the sunset and still brighter than any star/planet I've seen at night.)  It seemed to stay stationary, at least laterally to me (though, I was moving in a car). 	I quickly fumbled for my camera phone, but by the time I had cleared enough storage space to take the shot, it was gone (probably 20-30 seconds).  A few minutes later I saw it again (at least in the same area it had been in before, but I am unsure as to whether it was in the same exact position or not).  Still driving home, I fumbled for the camera phone again and by the time I unlocked the keys it had dissapeared again* (10-15 seconds). 	I searched the sky in the following seconds for something, anything...  I saw a few, seemingly lighting-fast, streaks of light, creating 3-5 sharp vertices of streak (implying ridiculous control), and nothing after that.  The streaks were of the same color as the light I saw, though they were much more faint, to the effect that I am still questioning whether the streaks were corporeal or something produced by my eyes.  For this, I am hoping to find other witnesses to the event.  * I never saw the light source appear or dissapear.  In other words, I was fuddling with my camera phone too much and it had already appeared/dissapeared by the times I had looked up for it. ((NUFORC Note:  Contrail??  PD));40.0146;-75.7136

I looked out my window and thought I was viewing a bright white star or planet below the moon.  But, after a few seconds, what I thought was a star began to move straight up towards the moon and then vanished after about 10 seconds.;40.0146;-75.7136

It wasn't a plane because all the other planes were flashing, it was going extremely too fast and it was too big to be a satellite and it wasn't a shooting star because this moved all over the sky.  It was so weird! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.0146;-75.7136

It passed next to the moon.  As it passed the moon it turned red in color than disappeared.  It was not a comet there was no trail or sound.  It did not fly the full sky.  When it passed the moon it just vanished.  The red color was so quick, just a flash then it was gone.  It was so bright.  There wasn't a cloud in the sky. I could see every star.  It was a beautiful night.;40.0146;-75.7136
Multiple slow moving craft seen all over the sky during early morning hours.;2021-06-18 01:00:00;1 hour;Multiple slow moving craft seen all over the sky during early morning hours. On the way upstairs, I looked out my window and noticed things in the sky that were peculiar enough to make me turn around and go outside. It was a really clear night and there was a lot of odd air activity. I sat on my deck until 2am, focused on this one distant point in sky west of the big dipper. An object was hovering with side lights flickering for at least an hour. It frustrated me because the object had subtle, yet significant movement, so i could rule out stars, but not a helicopter/drone, and it was too far to get a clear definition. While I was focused on that object, I had at least two, much closer craft in another part of the sky fly nearby, They had a round profile and moved slow, quiet, and had subtle flickering lights along the belt of the craft. Underneath, there were red, low contrast, round lights that either spun in a circle, or pulsated on/off.  I don’t think I would have noticed the crafts if I wasn’t already looking at the sky. Later, a! nother craft, also slow and quiet, flew from behind and directly over me.  That craft had two relatively large orange lights spaced apart (shaped like car headlights aimed down without casting a beam) moving along a flight path that didn’t make sense as a plane.;40.0146;-75.7136
