Huge hovering ufo above home.;1985-09-14 22:00:00;2 minutes;Huge hovering ufo above home. Coming home in the evening around 10:00 P.M. I was riding my motorcycle on Boot Rd. traveling west when I saw a huge UFO hovering about 150 feet above a home.  Cross member I beams underneath with clear dimmer lights eluminating the underside of craft.  I pulled over to view along with another person who was driving a station wagon.  Craft made no sound at all.  It was a very beautiful machine.  After viewing for about a minute I got a little scared and began to pull away and as I did it floated away from the home and hoovered out of sight very slowly.  This happened in the early 80's and my only regret was I didn't get the persons name in the station wagon to support my story.  Everyone thinks I'm crazy when I tell them my story.
