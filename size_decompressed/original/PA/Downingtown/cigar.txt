I was traveling East on Rt 30 bypass, as I past the Rt 322 (Manor Ave) overpass, I noticed something in the sky to the north of me.     I first thought that the object was a plane, only I could not see any wings or defined tail section.  It was grayish white and metallic.   It did not move from the time I noticed it until the time I got off the bypass at the Quarry Rd exit.  I believe it was still there when I got the intersection of business Rt 30 and Quarry Rd.   The sky was clear and the sun was to the south east.  It appeared to be over Loinville.  Not a helicopter.  Not reflection of light.  Not a balloon.  No vapor trail like the plane flying higher than this object.  Either, a hovering plane or UFO!;40.0146;-75.7136
