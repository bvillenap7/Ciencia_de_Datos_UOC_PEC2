There it was. I saw a burning ball fly across the sky over my house into the clouds towards the southwest.  It lasted about 3-4 seconds..;40.0146;-75.7136
Sparking Fireball spotted rising in the early morning PA sky!;2011-01-11 05:19:00;10 seconds;Sparking Fireball spotted rising in the early morning PA sky! I am a teacher and have never experienced seeing an object quite like the one I saw in the sky this morning(1/11/11).  I googled what I saw, stumbled upon this website and thought I should report my sighting in case it was at all useful to anyone documenting these sorts of events. I somehow awoke this morning, as I often do, and as always I looked at my phone to see what time it was. It was 5:19 am.  For some reason I rolled over and something in the North/Northwestern sky caught my eye.  There was  one orange/yellow fireball that appeared to have sparks all around it rising upward into the sky from the distant treeline.  It appeared to be about as large as the moon.  There was no tail. The object went straight up for a few seconds and then slightly to the northeast or 1 o'clock direction.   After about 10 seconds I no longer could see the object.;40.0146;-75.7136
