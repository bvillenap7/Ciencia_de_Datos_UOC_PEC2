Red and green lights on silent flying object at ~50 feet height and ~50 yard distance from me.;2016-05-21 23:15:00;~1 minute;Red and green lights on silent flying object at ~50 feet height and ~50 yard distance from me. Leaving work on Uwchlan Ave. across from Severgn Apartments at 11:15pm.  Directly across from the entrance to my workplace, I saw a red and green light heading in my direction approximately what I thought to be some distance away(maybe a mile).  After a few seconds I realized the lights were actually closer than I thought.  As they got closer I could see that the lights were attached to an irregular shaped object approximately 50 feet in the air heading South.  I estimated the lights to be a bit smaller than traffic lights and the body of the object to be a bit smaller than the size of a dishwasher.  This object moved very slowly(maybe 5mph) over Severgn Aparments toward Crump Road.  I opened my car window and heard no noise at all coming from the object.  I followed and watched the object as I drove South on Uwchlan Ave.  I turned left onto Crump Rd. and then right onto Whitford Rd. to follow the object but it had disappeared somewhere over the tree line.   I have never seen anything like this before in my life.;40.0146;-75.7136
