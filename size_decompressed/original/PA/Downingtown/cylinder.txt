cylinder object in night sky;2005-10-18 20:30:00;1 minute;cylinder object in night sky On either Monday Oct. 17 or Tuesday Oct. 18 (I can't recall the exact date), I was in the front yard of my house looking for our house cat, ((name deleted)), who likes to 'escape' from our house sometimes.   As I walked around the yard, calling to her, I looked up into the night sky and, after a few moments, noticed a cylinder or disk shaped black object zip back and forth across the sky a few times, very quickly.   It was far enough away that I could not notice detail, but it appeared to be tapered at each end.  It definitely had a mass to it and didn't appear to be something that was projected, as I could notice a bit of light reflected off of it.   Its movement was very fast and it almost seemed to move from one part of the sky to another by 'zipping' along and then suddenly slowing and stopping.  I'm not sure how else to explain the odd movement.  I don't believe in aliens or anything of the like but I know what I saw and I do not believe it was of this world.
