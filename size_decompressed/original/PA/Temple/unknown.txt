6-10 white lights in a V formation flying south at hight speed.;2013-11-20 21:30:00;Seconds;6-10 white lights in a V formation flying south at hight speed. From my porch, facing west, I saw a V shaped formation of 6-10 pale white lights traveling south. They were very faint and hard to focus on. They seemed far away, but fast moving. There was no strobe lights or red lights.  I'm not sure, but each light may have been a separate craft since the lights may have been moving slightly in relation to each other (as if they were not lights affixed to a single object).  But, I'm not sure of this since they were hard to focus on, and my view of them was quickly obstructed by trees/houses as they flew behind them. If they were separate objects, they were definitely flying in a strict V shaped formation, like ducks/geese. All aircraft I've seen at night around here have at least one red light and a strobe light, never more than 3-4 lights. There was no noise.
