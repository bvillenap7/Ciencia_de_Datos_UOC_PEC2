Refer. to the report from Carmichaels, Pa. on 21 March 2004 at 20:30 hrs.;2004-03-21 20:30:00;Appx. 45 mins.;Refer. to the report from Carmichaels, Pa. on 21 March 2004 at 20:30 hrs. My son and I were six miles from Carmichaels, Pa in the village of Garards Fort, Pa on a hill using a moderately good telescopestar gazing and we as well saw the light inthe western sky, however with our charts and maps we concluded the light was Venus, I believe the atmosphere played into the glow and movement of the planet it did look very odd. The area howver does have heavy aircraft traffic with Pgh. Int. airport to the north and Morgantown, WV regional airport to the south, but the aircraft are easily identifiable in our location. The object we suspect to be Venus was not an aircraft as we know them.;39.8859;-79.9757
Object did not look like a plane  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2004-03-21 20:30:00;8:00 to 9:30;Object did not look like a plane West of our location would have been little washiton PA then Weeling West Virgina then ohio. Object move verticaly and horizonality other planes in the sky were around the western sky's and wasn't moving as fast as the object in question and also the object was in a fixed position for a period of time.It was much larger than the other planes that was moving in the sky in that area,but the light was bigger than the stars in the backround also the object moves left to right or up or down faster than the other planes in the sky. becuase it was dark we are going of off the light of the planes compared to the object which was much bigger so it was hard to tell from were I was looking from the planes was smaller and the planes could be from the size of them could be 12 miles away and flying at 14,000 ft or 20,000 ft., but from the size of the object and the way it moved which was bigger it might have ben over little Washiton PA or Ruff Creek PA or Marryana PA or Jefferson PA but the object looked totally defferent than the stars in the backround which the object was bigger than the stars and moved in front of them and the planes in the area which were moving slower than the object moved, but it seemed alot closer,but it dissapeared in to the western sky becouse there is a hill to the west were I was located I couldn't see it anymore.I looked at it with simmons model ll07 10*50 WA Redline Coded Optics 367 ft@1,000 yds and it didn't look like a plane and it didn't have any running light's.
