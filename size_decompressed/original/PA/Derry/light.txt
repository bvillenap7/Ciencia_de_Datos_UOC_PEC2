Orange lights in the sky.;2017-06-09 03:55:00;Unknown;Orange lights in the sky. On my way to work, using a side road to hit a major highway, off to my left there were orange-ish lights in the sky.  I stopped, and went in reverse then stopped to make sure what I was seeing was real.   I pulled out my phone and recorded for a few seconds, looked at the lights for a bit longer then took off down the road as not to be late for work.;40.3348;-79.3307
