During a summer in the seventies, my brother and I were driving home after a severe thunderstorm.  The storm had high winds and there was something about the air that night that was different.  The storm had ended and we were approaching a plateau where the high school is located.  There is two high objects there on this plateau, the water tower and two grain silos. As we were making the approach, I noticed a light hovering above the grain silo's.  This light was round in shape and looked like the same light as fire.  It hovered above the twin silo's.  My brother then noticed the light and asked me if I saw it too. We didn't know what it was.  As were got within 500 yards, it began to move and did not make any noise.  I began speeding toward the object as if we had scared it.  I approached 85 miles an hour and seemed to catch up to it. It was as if it had not wanted us to get closer.  It began to speed up more quickly. When the object seemed to have the ability to go over the horizon, I began to be disappointed.  I flashed my auto lights and honked the horn.  It seemed to wait at the horizon. My brother and I had to drive down into a valley and up another hill to where this horizon was located.  My brother was deathly afraid and I wanted to make some kind of contact.  We drove around on top of this hill and I had the feeling that something or someone was around.  That was the last time that I saw this object.  However, my brother drives a newspaper route in the morning and he states that he has saw it again.  I can't confirm it but I know what my brother and I had seen.  I had thought it was ball lightning but it acted as if it was hovering above the silo with intent.  And when we approached, why did it speed away?;40.8303;-78.3665
