An object followed my car parallel to me then stopped when I stopped & observed me for 5 minutes.;1989-01-05 00:15:00;10 minutes;An object followed my car parallel to me then stopped when I stopped & observed me for 5 minutes. I was driving along a road and noticed this object following parallel to me.  I pulled into a deserted parking lot, got out of my car and the object stopped, turned toward me, and dipped its front end.  I stared at it, and it observed me from about 50 to 60 feet from the ground.  The object was black and shaped like a helicopter, but had no working parts or lights.  The object started following me in Philadelphia, and stopped where I stopped in Bensalem.  It was a clear winter night.  After observing me it moved away quickly and disappeared in the sky.

TRUCK SIZE CIGAR SHAPE OBJECT OVER THE BLUE ROUT 476 in the SUBERBS OF PHILADELPHIA;2001-08-10 11:47:00;20 seconds;TRUCK SIZE CIGAR SHAPE OBJECT OVER THE BLUE ROUT 476 in the SUBERBS OF PHILADELPHIA At 11:47 AM I was driving to work and directly ahead of me, a half of a mile or so, I saw an object that resembled a cigar shape, quickly, zooming over the highway, until I couldn't see it anymore, over the trees it disappeared. The craft looked as though it was not that large, meaning, the size of a truck. It seemed to refect the sky on the top, and more dark on the bottom half. It was not high at all, as far as my view, a half mile ahead, it looked like it was maybe a hundred feet over the highway. If I were to hold out my arm and clench my fist, the object would be about half the size of my fist. No one else, as far as I could see, saw the object. But, because I love looking into the sky, (FOR UFO'S) I am more alert to the stranger objects then most people. This was not a plane, not a bird, not a helecopter. The object kind of teetered back and forth as it went pass. Almost out of control. I have seen ufo's many times, this was the second time that a UFO was within a hundred feet from the ground. The other time was last year about the same time period, but I did not report that.  I am writing to see if you got anymore reports posted.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Flying cigar-shaped saucer in Philadelphia, PA in 2002;2002-06-14 12:00:00;10 seconds;Flying cigar-shaped saucer in Philadelphia, PA in 2002 It was a clear day in the summer.  I was walking to the grocery store.  I noticed a flying cigar-shaped saucer in the sky.  It was moving fast like a jet and made no sound.  It had no wings, no windows, and it was shiny. It was flying low enough for me to get a good look at it to tell it was not an airplane or a toy of some sort.  I watched it fly for about 10 seconds until it was too far for me to see it.   I'm not sure when the date was, but it was a while ago.  I was in my early 20's,  I am 36 now.  I still remember that day because as I was watching it, I made sure not to forget about it.  It was a cool experience because I could not understand why it made no sound or had no wings and appeared to be just floating through the sky.  About a week later I was walking outside, I don't remember where to, and a jet was flying by in the same direction at about the same speed as the saucer was.  It was clearly a jet of some sort and loud as jets usually are (the sound was foll! owing the jet).  That's all I remember and I haven't seen anything like it since.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Philadelphia - Seen UFO;2006-04-09 14:36:00;about a minute and a half;Philadelphia - Seen UFO We were walking around Ben Franklin Parkway, on our way to the Franklin Institute, and my friend pointed to the sky and pointed to a blimp.  I don't know what it is about blimps that always make people want to look up and watch them, but i looked.  I didnt really see a blimp though.  It looked like one, but there was no tail thing, no pilot area, and especially no ad on the side. Before i actually thought it could be something other than a blimp, it spun around horozontaly, and disapeared.  It was pretty freaky, and i think we were the only two to see it.  Does anyone here have answers?;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
dark gray object over the city of Philadelphia for 2 minuets;2009-07-04 02:56:00;2 minuets;On 7-4-2009 I observed a dark gray object over the city of Philadelphia for 2 minuets between 2:56am to 2:58am.  It was very high traveling from north to south  directly overhead and had no sound.  It had 2 lights, one on each wing that were not blinking and as bright as the stars around them.  The object blocked out the stars as it moved and you could just make out its silhouetted in the dark blue of the skies background.  It was elongated (Cigar shaped) with a bulge in the middle.  At arm's length it was the length of my thumb.  Just before I lost sight of it I observed it tilt up and it quickly faded into the darkness of the sky. In my opinion it was very large but I canâ€™t give an estimate of its size or its distance.  I am 50 years old, I have been star gazing all of my life and have never seen anything like this before.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
The object is clearly visible  moving across many pictures taken from a stationary camera on a tripod.;2009-07-04 22:02:00;18 minutes;The object is clearly visible  moving across many pictures taken from a stationary camera on a tripod. While attending the 4th of July celebration and fireworks display in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, From around 10:02PM to 10:22PM ET, I took many rapid fire photos of the fireworks display.  The camera was on a tripod and the shutter was released via remote.  Upon reviewing the photos, I noticed a long thin object with lights moving from right to left across many of the photos.  The camera was on a slow shutter setting to record the trails of lights from the fireworks and although the fireworks are streaking, the object is not creating streaks or trails. The lights on the object are clearly defined separately.  I was watching the fireworks live as they happened while only occassionally glancing at the display on the camera.  I never saw anything at all with my naked eye.  I have many photos with no objects in them, yet I have many series of photos with the object moving across the landscape.  I also have many photos of the same landscape taken during daylight hours which reveals no explanation for these objects and lights.  I have sent 2 photos to the director of the ufo reporting center for his examination.  The 2 photos are from a series of 6 shots taken at 10:08PM that show the object moving across the landscape.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Using my binoculars I witnessed a cigar shaped, rusty orange colored object fly from my south to east .;2016-10-22 23:38:00;55 seconds;Using my binoculars I witnessed a cigar shaped, rusty orange colored object fly from my south to east . Looking out my window while star gazing I witnessed a slow moving object travel from my south to my east at an altitude of aprroximately 65 degrees.  At first I thought the object was an aircraft.  Upon further inspection with my 10 x's binoculars there were no navigation lights however the craft was somehow illuminated.  Its color appeared a rusty orange.  Through the binocs the size of the UFO would be compared to a jet airliner.  I could not make out any exact details of the flying object except it was cigar shaped with what appeared to be solar panels or wings of some kind located around the middle of the its body. The evening was clear, the moon was not up yet and in or near it's last quarter phase. Conditions were favorable for star gazing.  My dilemma, since there were no lights on the aircraft, why or how was it illuminated? Looking through my binoculars (10 x's)the craft I saw was about the same size as a jet airliner. The UFO gave no emission or contrail. It had to be in at least a low orbit around our planet. That far away, looking through my binoculars it appeared to be the same size as a jet airliner.  The object had to be gigantic for it to appear the size as a jet airliner. How else could the object be illuminated if not from the moon's reflection.  I've seen, on many occasions, the ISS and never have been able to see any detail of that craft the way I did this object. So, here I am making a UFO report.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
