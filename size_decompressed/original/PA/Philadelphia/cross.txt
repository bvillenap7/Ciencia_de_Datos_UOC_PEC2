Cross shaped craft in Philadelphia, PA.;2019-01-06 00:55:00;1 minute;Cross shaped craft in Philadelphia, PA. I'm an Uber driver, so I spend a lot of later nights out.  I was taking a break waiting for something to happen with work, and I was on the phone with my wife.  I was leaned back in the seat looking up through the sunroof, a habit I developed because of an interest in the UFO subject, when I saw something in the sky.  I told my wife, and she said to get off the phone and try to record it.  I got out of my car and looked up and saw a craft, shaped like a letter t, or a cross.  The best way I can describe it is, the horizontal line of the cross was very close to the top, almost like an uppercase T.  It was illuminated, but not like, from lights, like the craft it self was emitting the light.  And it was silent, like ZERO SOUND.  By the time I took all of this in, I realized I was still holding my phone and was able to snap a few quick pictures.  It all took less than a minute.  I'm not good with guessing the height of something in the air, but it wasn't very high up, ma! ybe helicopter height.  Like a few hundred to a thousand feet up.  It was moving very fast, I was facing north,it was traveling from West to East, and again completely silently.  I know what a plane, helicopter,and drones sound like and this wasn't any of those.  I'm positive because while I was still looking up, hoping it would turn around, and I could get some video, a helicopter sped by very loudly in the same direction.  I'm almost certain it was chasing the craft.  I went that same night on Reddit to post any the experience, and see if anyone else has seen it.  I got a response from a guy who said he was on I95 north, and he and his girlfriend had seen a strange craft in the sky.  I'm sure it was the same one, 95 north would have been to the east, the same direction the craft was going.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
