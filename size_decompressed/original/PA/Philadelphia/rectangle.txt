It was bitterly cold (approx. 15 degrees Far) And very windy. At appox.6: 02 PM I went out back into her small yard to have a cigarette (she doesn't like the smoking inside). About a minute or two passed when I thought I saw movement in the sky (It was mostly dark with indirect distant light from further down the street, the sky was devoid of any clouds, only stars were visible) I looked up quickly I moved further into the yard to see what it was when I saw these three rectangular objects moving in tandem. They were not like anything I ever saw in my entire lifetime. They were moving at a quicker pace (based on their approximate altitude I would estimate much faster than any commercial or non-commercial aircraft I have ever seen. They glowed with a subtle consistent amber color, rectangular in shape but with smooth edges. I followed them without a blink for about 6 seconds before they went out of view over the rooftop. When I first saw them they were in tandem, before they went out of view the were going out of tandem. Needless to say i was stunned but excited. Before I went back into the house I just reaffirmed to my self that I really saw this and did not imagine it. That only took about a second.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Object appears on one digital photograph but not the next frame taken seconds later.;2005-04-18 17:58:00;unknown;Object appears on one digital photograph but not the next frame taken seconds later. Sighting Report:   Last week I was reviewing some photos I had taken a few weeks ago, on April 18th. I noticed a large speck in the sky on one shot.  Using a computer to enlarge the area by 1000% I can see it appears to have a flat bottom and top of different circumferences.  The left side of the narrower upper section appears to either be reflecting or emitting light. The object does not appear on the next photo, which was taken less than two minutes later. I was facing Southeast from the north bank of the Schkulkill River, near the Art Museum.  The building is across the river.   I didn't notice the object when I took the photo or when first reviewing them. There are no other similar objects on any other photos. ((NUFORC Note:  We have reviewed the photos, and we do not know what the object is.  It is very distant, very small, and blurry.  We cannot rule out the possibility that the object might be a bird, perhaps a pigeon, but that is only a guess.  PD));39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
