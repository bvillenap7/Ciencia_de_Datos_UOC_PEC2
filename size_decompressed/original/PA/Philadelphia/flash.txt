It was like the object was going in one direction and suddenly made a loop a flach at the top of the loop, vapor trail, then a disc shaped, black object fell at a forty five degree angle.

Bright flashing light in sky then strobes of flashes from ground.;2014-06-28 22:45:00;30 minutes;Bright flashing light in sky then strobes of flashes from ground. From balcony, noticed a bright light for a split second that seemed very high in the night sky.  Seconds after we noticed multiple flashes of light that seemed to come from the ground up (over a distance) maybe in New Jersey.   I am in Philadelphia but can see across Delaware river.  No booms or smoke and and seemed like a massive strobe.  Have seen this a couple times before but never really paid much attention.   Other people I have talked to have seen same flashes.  Very bizarre.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
