There was a bright light that slowly traveled across the sky above Philadelphia heading West.;1999-09-18 21:00:00;all night;There was a bright light that slowly traveled across the sky above Philadelphia heading West. I saw a bright light over the buildings in Philadelphia aroun 9pm. It looked stationary although it was slowly ans steadily moving. At first it appeared so low I thought it might be a blimp. But there were no flashing lights, just one bright light like a giant star. I checked out the other lights in the sky and plane lights were way too weak and swo were the few stars I could see. I got a telescope out (the usual home telescope) and managed to get a look at it close up - as did 8 friends of mine. We all agreed we could not idetnify the light. Through the telescope the light looked like a perfect white circle kind of fuzzy and slight red hues on the top and blue hues on the bottom. The edges appeared to change slightly so sometimes it looked liked an egg. At first it disappeared and reappeard a couple times but once it was higher up in the sky it became brighter and it's been there all night traveling West.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Saw a round object with lights flashing on the bottom in a circular motion around the object.;2000-03-31 23:30:00;5 min;Saw a round object with lights flashing on the bottom in a circular motion around the object. I can view the approach of landing aircraft to Philadelphia International Airport from my backyard.  I always see landing lights, but this was different.  It was round in appearance, and had what appeared to be running lights on the bottom that flashed in a circular flashing motion. I watched it, and it was moving very slowly, much slower than approaching aircraft, and this craft itself was about 2-3000 ft. higher than approaching aircraft.  It seemed to be further away than the approaching aircraft in distance and at about 40° from the horizon.  It moved very slowly for about five minutes, then turned and went the other way in the same speed.  I thought it was strange, and might have been a helicopter, but it was rather high for a helicopter, not to mention in restricted airspace.  Not sure if any pilots might have saw it, but I wouldn't know how to go about and request that info.  After it changed direction, it continued on at a slow pace towards the east to NJ.  Distance was a factor, so I knew my camcorder would just capture a shaking image of a light with no real help.  If there were any others that saw this object, it would be nice to know, to either confirm my site or disbunk it as a helicopter...;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Kings Dominion Circle, seen at night five years ago;2003-11-01 23:00:00;10 min;Kings Dominion Circle, seen at night five years ago This report is being resent since it pertains to the recent sighting in Virginia, Kings Dominion getting much attention now.   It was night and I witnessed small orbs of light moving like ballons up into the sky. Maybe twenty or thirty.  When they reached a point almost directly above my house, they formed a perfect circle, exactly like the one seen on the Kings Dominion video.  They hovered and spun like this for a few seconds before breaking up and moving off to the east.  This episode then repeated two more times with craft coming from the west and moving off to the east.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
May/2006 - Video: UFO Over Philadelphia?;2006-05-28 17:00:00;3-1/2 minutes;May/2006 - Video: UFO Over Philadelphia? I spent the weekend in New Jersey and on Sunday, my father gave me a ride back to Philadelphia.  I drove, and he asked if I could stop down in Chinatown so he could pick up some tea and some new teacups.  I took 95-N and got off at the Washington Ave exit, and proceeded up Washington Ave to 7th St. A few blocks before I turned onto 7th, I was looking up at the clouds when I saw something just kind of sitting there in the clouds that I could not identify.  When we turned south on 7th St., we pulled into a parking lot just off the intersection and across from Pho Ha where my father wanted to stop. I decided to hop out and use the DV camcorder my folks bought for my girlfriend and I back in Novemember when our son was born, and started recording.  The quality is not the best, and there's a Vietnamese band playing in the background in part of the footage but take a look. It's clearly not an airplane or a helicopter.  Around 2:38, I zoom all the way out to show just how far away this thing is, and based on that (which you'll see), I don't feel confident that it's a balloon as from that distance, even with my good eyesight, I don't think I would have seen a regular balloon flying that high, that far away, with the late afternoon sun kind of in my eyes otherwise.  So by definition, it's a UFO. What exactly it is, I don't know but enjoy, let others know for enjoyment if you want, and leave some comments if you want.  I wrote about it on my website here - (http://phillybits.blogspot.com/2006/05/ufo-sighting-over-philadelphia.html)  Video can be seen here - (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKEk5nu00lQ);39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Two strange encounters at the same location in Philadelphia.;2008-11-22 20:00:00;10-15 seconds;Two strange encounters at the same location in Philadelphia. It was like a black balloon darker than the night sky with a thin white rim around it.  I thought of someone releasing a balloon at the time but it was stuck in mid air, no cars riding pass on usually a busy street, no people just me and a strange black male wearing all black looking like a security guard standing across the street, but directly under the object, if you get what I'm saying.   This was in November 2008, but it still bothers me till this day.   At the same location, years later, I had an encounter with a strange pale looking Asian guy.  The location is Woolston Avenue and Wyncote, Philadelphia, PA, 19138, over top of a sheet metal factory that is still here today in August 2015.   My friends call me high and make jokes about me when I tell the story to them over and over, I just want to know what I am experiencing.  Call me ((name deleted));39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Black balloon and another man in black.;2008-11-23 20:00:00;15 seconds;Black balloon and another man in black. November 2008, about 5 minutes past 8:00 pm.  I'm walking home alone from a friend's house.  Something catches my eye on the night sky.  It looks like it appears to be a black balloon drifting above the sheet metal factory that's located above my block as I'm thinking.   I keep my eyes on it with the intentions of watching the balloon until it drifted away and was no longer in sight.  But this object didn't do just that, it paused in mid air.  Once that happened, I slowly jogged closer to the sheet metal factory to get a much better view.  What I then seen in the sky was a perfect black circle with a thin white rim around it. Very still and not moving but floating above the metal factory.  I was the only person outside at the time.  On usually a bright busy street it seem very still and somewhat dark that night, for the circle to be darker than the sky.  My cell phone wasn't advanced enough to take a good photo of the object so I figured why waste my time trying to record ! for such poor quality.   I keep my eyes on the object for a good 15 seconds.  Suddenly, the white door beside the sheet metal factory on Wyncote avenue opens up and out came a African American male wearing all black.  Long sleeve black shirt, black pants, and black boots.  This man was standing directly under the object floating about the building.  He smoothly lit up his cigarette staring at me from across the street, but I gave him temporary attention and looked back up at the object.  Then in a quick second, the object disappears.  Not saying a word to the man in black across the street.   I anxiously run to my house and tell everyone the exclusive news.  This happened at the very exact location of me meeting the strange Asian like man in black.  This took place many months close to a year after my first encounter.

Parent & Child Circles on Sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights?  PD));2012-03-24 19:45:00;2 hours;Parent & Child Circles on Sky On March 24th, 2012, was picking up my own cake delivery from Sams Club, Bucks County, PA was traveling towards I-95S. Noticed 6 Circular Dull Flash light Objects (UFO) with one Big Circle at the center and rest 4 Normal bright Circles at each corner of Big Circle and another Small Sparkling Oval Shaped UFO leading direction to follow my car.  I started noticing it when I took right onto US-13 S/Bristol Pike merging I-95S. 6 Circles followed my direction and small sparkling UFO was leading big ones. One the way it started raining, though I missed it, when rain stopped, again noticed it was following my direction, again I saw it. When I reached Philadelphia Downtown toward I-676 W/US-30, was heading for another pickup from Indian restaurant at University City, near UPenn & again when returning back I saw those UFO's it did not go away instead it was following me, wherever I go.  At last at 9:30PM I reached home to my Apartments near Philadelphia Museum of Arts,  These Circles were revolving and Circulating above my parking & my apartment, I called my wife to look out for circle from Balcony, she did saw the same circles, now the Big one remained dull and cloudy and we could see only half of it since it was positioned directly above my apartment but we could see rest 4 Circles and one Oval very bright shines ones like a Circular Aircraft - UFO's. It took a while 15 min approximately after I unloaded my things from my car, it disappeared in sky. Very remarkable experience.  but I don’t have any photos or it never clicked my mind to video record this, All I felt was strange and curious and surprised, I could notice myself I was became very much concentrated on what I was doing even I pushed myself out to call my wife to see from Balcony, I had a feeling of deep meditation and single mind directed on what I was doing at that moment when I got out of my car for unloading. I couldn't explain anymore or I don’t know how to explain this, it’s an experience.  Worst thing when this incident happened nobody was around me to look at, it’s a perfect time, I am not sure whether others noticed. I was searching for a official site to report this event.

((HOAX??)) Six black UFO's over NE Philadelphia--blue and red lights.;2014-03-16 22:00:00;30 seconds;Six black UFO's over NE Philadelphia--blue and red lights. I saw six or more ufos flying over northeast philadelphia.  The crafts were circular but at closer expectation may have been in the shape of an aircraft.  They were black with red and blue lights flickering traveling northwest to east south.  They were flying somewhat high compared to other aircraft I've seen, human.  They were very noisey also like incredibly loins ((??)).   I'm not sure if they may have been military but still felt the urge to report.   Earlier in the day while inside a building, not my home, I heard the same noise and tried to look out a window but was unable to see anything.   This happened between 11am-3pm.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

From Phila. looking SE I observed an orange orb that traveled down and then away from my sight.;2014-09-27 05:46:00;15 seconds;From Phila. looking SE I observed an orange orb that traveled down and then away from my sight. On Sept.27th at approximately 5:45 A.M. (+/- 2 minutes) while viewing the south east skies (primarily more to the east vs. south) I noticed an orange orb under the star Regulus.   It appeared to travel straight down from Regulus to almost my viewing horizon and then travel south or distally away from my vantage point.  The orange orb continued on this path until finally dipping below my horizon and out of sight. I was able to apply both my 4x30 and 10x50 binoculars to the object.  This did not reveal any detail to enhance my description of the orb.  I played my Starry Night software and did not notice any satellites traveling in this pattern during this time period.  My background is I am a beginner star watcher with over a year sky watching experience.  I own a 4 x 30 and 10 x 50 range binoculars and a 100mm Orion tabletop telescope with the ability of 80x magnification at this time.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Two green lights side by side moving in unison apparently a single craft, gradually changing to red, then green, then vanished.;2015-03-11 22:35:00;10 minutes;two green lights side by side moving in unison apparently a single craft, gradually changing to red, then green, then vanished. Just a few moments ago on the 3rd floor of my townhouse in South Philly facing City Hall exactly 2 miles away, I was putting my 3 year old son to bed.   He was over my shoulder looking out the window when he said, what's that?  Lots of helicopters and airport traffic pass over our heads on the way to the airport, and there's a helipad or two in the city so I'm quite accustomed to the aircraft in the area.  This one was intriguingly different.   I stood by the window to watch for about 2 minutes, then put him to bed, then ran up to our 4th floor deck, grabbed the binoculars and watched it for about 2 more minutes before it suddenly disappeared before my eyes.  It was two green lights side by side, kind of like headlights, but not blinking.  Usually you expect with aircraft to see white lights and/or red lights, and blinking.   The green was eye-catching.  It hovered west behind the Comcast skyscraper, then went UP, then wafted back east toward City Hall.  Then it turned red! Again no blinking, just both lights slowly changed to red.   It hovered around a bit as though circling City Hall, then turned green again, then gradually red, then like I said, right in front of my eyes, vanished.   I wondered if it was someone's toy drone or something but way too big and way too high for that, and way too bright in my opinion.   Wondering if anyone else saw it.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

Several round white object sight near my flight traveling in opposite direction at a high rate of speed.;2021-07-19 19:35:00;3 to 5 seconds;Several round white object sight near my flight traveling in opposite direction at a high rate of speed. While on flight # AA6201 from Philadelphia to Greensboro.  I was in seat 10A window on the left side of the plane as we flew south.  In our ascent, I estimate maybe 4 to 6 minutes post take off, I observed the objects  I estimate our altitude was likely 4 to 5 thousand.  I know we had not been alerted to reaching 10,000 feet until many minutes later.  Looking out of the window I observe red a number of bright white round objects traveling very close to our craft moving in the opposite direction.  I was initially alarmed fearing they were dangerously close at nearly the same altitude or just below.  The plane of course was traveling at a high speed but the speed at which these objects moved by suggested to me they we moving much faster.  As a result ocould only see them for a matter of seconds.  They were bright white and as best I could tell round.  My first thought was they resembled ping pong balls or soft balls but way bigger.  Much smaller than the plane! but substantial. Due to the speed I estimate  5 to six or more.  Each seemed to have what I can best describe as something resembling an antenna protruding from the center bottom of the object. I was hoping to learn if there were other reports from other witnesses or perhaps even the flight crew or air control.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
