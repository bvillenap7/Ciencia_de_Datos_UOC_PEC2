A bright flash seen in the sky facing west, 60 degrees above the horizon, heading downward from right to left, leaving a trail.;2000-09-09 03:30:00;3-5 seconds;A bright flash seen in the sky facing west, 60 degrees above the horizon, heading downward from right to left, leaving a trail. I was standing outside on the porch of the home where I work as a night shift private duty nurse. I was facing approximately north when the entire surrounding area lit up brightly for several seconds. I began looking toward the garage to my left on the property to see if a spotlight had been turned on. While turning, I noticed a bright light coming from high up shining through a tree in the yard. I stepped to my left to see the light without the tree being in the way. I was facing approximately west. At about sixty degrees above the horizon, I could see a bright trail angled down from right to left terminating in a bright mass. When I held my hand at arm's length, the length of the mass and tail together was roughly that of my index finger. Within a few seconds, the light from the object had faded. I did not notice any smoke remaining after the flash faded. My first thought was that perhaps it was an exceptionally large meteorite. I have seen numerous meteorites in my lifetime, but have never seen anything light up my surroundings like this did. I then wondered if it might have been an Iridium satellite deorbiting. The thought that there was a space shuttle mission recently launched to the international space station made me wonder if there could have been an accident associated with that, although the notion clearly seemed like a stretch of the imagination. I decided to report the object to the National UFO Reporting Center in hopes of perhaps finding a means of identifying what I had seen.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Ball lights form circles and rotate.  Two groups of two.;2003-11-22 23:20:00;five-ten minutes;Ball lights form circles and rotate.  Two groups of two. In the Northern sky, from west to east, two groups of faint circular lights moving slowly (floating), one trailing the other.  At first they seem to be a string (like a string of balloons, or possibly geese) with no definite shape. As they reach the sky directly above me, to the north, they begin to form arcs or semi-circles, and glow brighter.  Then, at least one of the groups, forms a perfectly closed circle and rotates for a second or two, glowing even brighter.  They go back to arc or string formation and continue towards the northeast, slowly fading in brightness as they move. This whole event possibly took two to three minutes.  However, as the first pair faded in the northeastern sky, a second pair appeared in exactly the same place in the northwestrn sky and repeated the same pattern as the first.  The entire two events took possibly 6 to 8 minutes to complete.  No one else witnessed the event with me. I was standing on our rooftop deck in the northern section of center city Philadelphia. I did call my brother on the phone, who lives across town, to desribe to him what I was seeing.  He looked outside his house but could not see anything, not having the same view of the sky that I did.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Circularly moving lights around an invisible cylinder transforms into V triad of lights with a red and green tail lightI;2011-08-20 10:00:00;20 sec;circularly moving lights around an invisible cylinder transforms into V triad of lights with a red and green tail lightI August 20, 2011.  12th and Locust, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania It was approximately 10:00 PM and my daughter and I were in the car waiting for a friend.  We were sitting and chatting when we heard a load noise that sounded like rubber hitting a fan, while simultaneously looking up and seeing an object.  The UFO were streams of moving lights that seemed to enclose a spool-shaped invisible form there was a form but it was cloaked.  Both of us were staring at it and wondering out load what it was when we witnessed it tilt down towards 7:00 position, then fold backward and stretch out into a V triad of  lights, with a green (top) and red (bottom) light following directly behind the triad. It started to move slowly down 12th when we lost sight of it. I tried unsuccessfully to follow it.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Eight fire ball shapes flying west , north, and straight up, but calm manner.  They were focused.;2016-01-31 20:00:00;10 minutes;Eight fire ball shapes flying west , north, and straight up, but calm manner.  They were focused It was 8pm on Sunday bight, and my boyfriend called his son and myself outside.  Red looking fireballs coming one after another flying in the skies.  It was light orange, but more in vivid red color and round with the naked eye.  They were approximately 2-3000 feet in air.  Very, very visual.  Flying over our head.  One after another.  These objects were heading northwest . When I look up couldn't believe my eyes.  They just kept coming.  Furthermore, there were commercial planes heading east passing them.  However, it did not effect these strange anomolies, or crafts. Lastly, some disappeared west into clouds, as thou they flew straight up into the sky.  Mean while, others headed northwest direction with no sound, as well. Overall, I have pictures to post.  And, 49 years of life , first time I witmessed such a event!  Red balls flying north, west , and straight up!  The pictures are all different shapes and colors.  As I kept snapping.  Furthermore, i have a photo, from a family member, in Bucks County that I've been holding.  She sent them to me, the night they came over her yard,  which is not the first time.  These images are amazing!  She will remain anonymous.  In the end, I too have seen with my very own eyes, so I'm ready to release her photo now.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
What did we all see?  Same craft, different night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2017-02-23 18:43:00;2-3 minutes;What did we all see?  Same craft, different night. My friend and I have just seen the same exact object in the sky that was described to us also by her sister and father earlier in the month, but did not believe it at the time.   Tonight it is 68°, no clouds.  Just a calm and warm night.  Appeared to be higher than aircrafts in altitude and distance, yet also seemed very large in size and almost translucent.  The craft looked like many contiguous circles changing formation with rope-like structures behind it, that could be described to as shaped like DNA.   Then continued to change shape to a round, arched object before getting out of view.  It moved slow the whole time, but was only in our sight for about 3 minutes.

This was the fourth UFO I've seen in my lifetime. the first one was maybe 20 years ago, the second one was maybe 8 years ago, the third;2021-06-15 17:00:00;2 minutes;This was the fourth UFO I've seen in my lifetime. the first one was maybe 20 years ago, the second one was maybe 8 years ago, the third one is the one I'm describing now. the fourth one was shortly after that other than the one I'm describing now,I'm really not sure what the other three were the first one could have easily been a satellite. the second one might have been a plastic trash bag spinning in the air, but it didn't blow around anywhere, it was in one spot spinning when I looked again it was gone so let's really just talk about the one I'm trying to report now. I was at work, like I said it was about 5:00 in the afternoon, I hesitate to use my job name so I won't, let's just say I was in the parking garage and I looked in the sky and I saw what I thought was an airplane. but I guess something made me look again it went behind the corner pillar of the garage so when I got to the other side I looked again, and what I saw look like the fuselage of a plane with no tail or wings. and it was now in the vertical position, when I first saw it it was in a horizontal position which is why I thought it was a plane the second time I looked it was in the vertical position, and it was slowly floating across the sky. just a little lower than a low flying plane, slightly lower. a gentleman was coming up the steps of the parking garage, I asked him sir what the heck is that he didn't seem too concerned he looked he saw it he said maybe it's a balloon. I said I don't think it's a balloon he said well I guess it could be anything and he looked with m! e for a few seconds and went on. when he turned to go on about his business that's when I told him now it stopped dead in the sky, in one position didn't move for about close to 10 seconds and I just stood there looking at it. it seemed to be made out of metal, some kind of craft, it had different things here and there, from top to bottom, like what look like maybe vents, and things nothing projecting off of it to the left or right or top or bottom Just a cylinder hanging in the air in the vertical position, and after a few seconds that's when it seemed to begin to flip around in random ways, for a minute I thought I saw would look like that typical triangle, but what I noticed it was doing to me it look like it's simply fell up out of the sky, as it went on a 45° angle, up once it started flipping and tumbling it appeared like if I had a rock and I got to the top of the empire State building and let it go, and a rock would fall down to the ground. this thing fell up out of! the blue sky all the way up and out and it was gone. thank you;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
