Three circular craft in a triangle formation passed in a northerly direction;1999-09-19 20:23:00;2 min;Three circular craft in a triangle formation passed in a northerly direction Sirs, On Sunday evening I went out on my back step to have a cigarette, which faces the southwest. I looked to my left (150 deg.) and saw three circular spots in a triangular pattern ,about 30 deg. above the horizon. At first I thought they were searchlights, then I realized that they were moving in unison. The three objects were circular in shape, and the bottoms were evenly illuminated in a brown-orange light, with no distinguishing features or markings. There were no navigation position lights or anti-collision strobes,red or white. There was no noise from these objects. From my perspective they appeared to be a little smaller than the size of a dime. During the pass one of the objects position changed in reference to the lead one. They were moving in a northerly direction.I ran into the house to get a time check and went back out and observed the objects until they faded from sight. Prior to losing the original three objects I looked directly overhead. I saw two points of light (at great altitude), similarly colored to the original three objects, moving in the same northerly direction. They did not twinkle and the fifth ones' position changed slightly in relation to number four. My home is near the intersection of Roosevelt Blvd. (US Rte 1) and Rhawn St. in northeast Philadelphia. I am about one mile south of Northeast Philadelphia airport and in the flightpath of runway 6. I am a Tech with the local telephone co.,an amateur radio operator, and hold a private pilots license, though not actively flying. Of all my years of looking up at the nighttime sky I never seen anything like this before, I am 53 yrs old. faded from sight. Prior to losing sight of the original three objects, I was looking dirctly overhead and saw two points of light,(at great altitude) similarly colored to the original three objects. They were moving in the same northerly direction and the fifth objects position shifted relative to the fourth. These two high altitude objects did not twinkle like stars. It was a clear night in Philadelphia with some very thin clouds. My home is west of the intersection of Roosevelt Blvd. (US Rte 1) and Rhawn St. I am about one mile south of Northeast Phila. airport and in line with runway 6. similarly colored to the original three, moving in the same direction;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Pitch BLACK UFO STING RAY SHAPE NO LIGHT OR SOUND;2002-01-15 01:00:00;2 minutes;Pitch BLACK UFO STING RAY SHAPE NO LIGHT OR SOUND On January 2002, it was about 1:00am the sky was like snow white because it was very cloudy it almost looked like day light. Before me and my girlfriend was going to bed I took a look out the window to see if it was raining as I looked up to the sky above the back side of the house I saw something black falling out the clouds the object was pitch black. It fell fast at first I thought it was a ballon but it came so close above the house that me and my girlfriend got to look at it for about to 2 whole minutes. We got a very good look at it. It came down and it looked like it was out of control then it stoped above the house trying to get control of its self. It woobled for  almost 2 minutes to get control of its self and fly away it gave me and my girlfriend enough time to really get a dam good look at it from all sides because it was turning in all directions as it was out of control. This is what it looked like, It was pitch black in color with no lights at all or windows. It was flat round on the bottom and it was round on the top but it had a bump in the middle like a cock pit with no windows on each side of the bump/cock pit it had silver/gray ridges I figure it might be the wings but it had no wings.On the back it had a short triangel shape tail which was also pitch black in color. This object made no noise it was silent It almost looked just like a sting ray. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

It came shooting down right out of the white clouds and when it try to straighten its self it wobbled side to side like it was out of control for a few seconds and that is how we seen a lot of details, I mean a had enough time to see it all, it almost looked like a flying stingray. It was not a stealth, because the next day I went on the internet and I looked up the stealth and it was nothing like what we saw. It was really a scary thing to experience, I could not believe what I was seen and I was glad that my wife saw it too. I'll never forget what we saw that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

a friend and I saw a diskus shaped UFO, a black ring with a silver inside which was missing an inside, then just suddenly vanished.;2004-06-18 18:31:00;25-30 seconds;a friend and I saw a diskus shaped UFO, a black ring with a silver inside which was missing an inside, then just suddenly vanished. Today June 18, 2004 at 6:31 PM, my friend Andrew and I (both 18) were making barbq chicken for the weekly Sabbath dinner. We were outside at my back yard relaxing. I has on a swinging bench as he was barbqing. I saw the strange diskus shaped thing. At first glance I thought it was a ballon. Then I of course as usual when seeing a ballon I watch it until it disappears into either a dot or into the clouds. So I took a second glance and noticed it was not a balloon. I called Andrew over and he thought I was insane, until he saw it himself. It was in the shape of a disk. The best way to describe it was it looked like a black tube and the inside was silver but was sort of concaved in, making a wide cone lacking a perfect filled doughnut.  It lasted for about 25-30 seconds. It was wobbiling and the size was about 9-10 meters in diameter. There were a few clouds, on a nice hot 90 degrees early evening. While watching it we called my cousin once removed to come out and see it, shortly after shouting his name, it just vanished into the blue sky. No clouds, just vanished, neither I nor my friend took our eye off of it as we called my cousin in. Just vanished miraculously into thin air.

Concave metallic disc spoted June 18th 2004;2004-06-18 18:31:00;25sec. (aprox);Concave metallic disc spoted June 18th 2004 My friend and I were sitting outside on swinging seats facing each other talking while we were waiting for the food we were barbequed to be cooked. My friend shouted to look at what he saw but I thought he was joking so ignored his cries. Finally I realized he wasn’t kidding and turned around only to see an object in the sky. It was visible over a tree in the distance. I was able to determine it was large in size. The object was a silver flat disk that was silver bordered by black with a concave center. The object was silent emitted no light. The object appeared to move effortlessly almost as if it was gliding on ice. The object wobbled slightly than immediately vanished. The whole incident only took place over the course of 25 seconds. We instantly went on the web to find out information with regard to where we could submit or file a incident report and found this site and here I am now.

At first, I thought it was a helicopter but when I went to look closer,I saw a classic saucer,gun-metal black, but I could see it clearly because a beam of light was coming down from the center of it.  It hovered there for 45 seconds or so, then it moved slowly east.  I could red lights around it. There was no sound. The light was the brightest  I have ever seen.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

Red and green lights over Philadelphia.;2015-06-21 23:54:00;15 minutes;Red and green lights over Philadelphia. Just before midnight when I was getting into bed I saw a bright red light outside my window.  I live on the 21st floor of an apartment building.  It was brighter than anything I've ever seen at night, so I walked to the window to take a look at it.   Off in the distance there was an object just hovering/floating.  It stayed in one spot for several minutes then it changed color from red lights to green lights.  After a few minutes it moved very quickly from one spot to another and just hovered in that spot for a few minutes.   I woke my girlfriend up to look and ran to the other room to wake my brother up also.  My girlfriend told me to take a video, but I didn't, thinking no one would believe me and not knowing that this website was out there.   After a few minutes it turned to red again and moved very quickly across the sky to another location.  After a few minutes the object started to drop down and disappeared behind a building that was in front of my building.  The object moved WAY too quick to be a helicopter or plane and just moved so effortlessly through the sky.   The colors were unlike anything I've ever seen and when they changed colors, it was like nothing I've ever seen.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
