Ball of fire streaks eastward over Phila., lands in Atlantic Ocean one mile from Resorts Intl.. ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??  PD));1978-05-29 20:00:00;15 seconds;Ball of fire streaks eastward over Philadelpia, lands in Atlantic Ocean one mile from Resorts International right after Grand Opening Was on the corner of 6th and Reed in Philadelphia, with my uncle ((name deleted)) and neighbor ((2nd name deleted)), both now deceased. At about 8 P.M. on or about May 29th, right after the Grand Opening of Resorts International, In Atlantic City, New Jersey.  Was standing looking south on 6th Street,in Philadelphia, when this fireball streaked eastwardly,not more than a block from where I was standing at a height of less than a thousand feet. This fireball was huge, it changed colors faster than my mind could register from yellow to orange to green to blue but not in any special order and like I said it changed colors so fast I couldn't tell.  The next day in the Philadelphia Inquirer there was a report of the ball of fire landing in the Atlantic Ocean one mile off of where Resorts International is.  Which is about 47 miles from where I originally witnessed the ball of light. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

Dense white unusual and persisten contrail with reddish fireball at tip resembled spacecraft reentry.;2001-09-01 16:30:00;appx 5 min;Dense white unusual and persisten contrail with reddish fireball at tip resembled spacecraft reentry. My wife and I were walking near the intersection of Second and Bainbridge streets in Philadelphia on a clear, cloudless late afternoon when I noticed a very dense and unusual contrail appearing above buildings to the SE, moving on a heading more or less parallel to the Delaware River, which runs ~SSW to NNE at that point.   The contrail seemed much wider and denser than a normal contrail, and had no gap in the center as is typical of normal airliner trails.  It was moving at about the normal speed of a high-altitude jet or perhaps somewhat faster, and seemed to be at the height of a normal jet at cruising altitude, but possibly higher - very hard to tell with no reference points.   At the head of the trail was a small but very obvious fiery reddish ball.  It may have been the reflection of the late-afternoon sun on a plane, but I've seen many, many airliners under these conditions and this looked different.  It twinkled and at no time did it appear to change intensity.  Usually a strong sun glint on an airliner will vary as the reflection angle changed, but this didn't.  It looked exactly like a giant reddish road flare making a dense smoke trail heading more or less toward northern New Jersey.   I say giant because of the size of the trail.  It is impossible to estimate the size of the object but it appeared comparable to the size of Venus or Saturn when they're at their largest and most visible.  A twinkling, starlike reddish road flare with an immense and persistent white smoke trail.  It was unusual enough that we stopped to watch it until it disappeared behind buildings.  It didn't change speed, heading, altitude or intensity, and the motion was very steady.  The smoke trail remained for at least several minutes.  My thought at the time was that it was a reentry of some satellite, or an unusual meteor.   I recall that there were some unusual meteor incidents in the time frame, but this was not the same as this one, for example: http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/07/23/flash.boom/index.html http://www.meteorobs.org/maillist/msg22061.html  It was shortly before 9/11, if I recall correctly. There were no other contrails visible at the time, by the way. This was the most obvious thing in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

2 bright lights spherical fireball type shape close together high up in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD));2004-11-05 05:15:00;30+minutes;2 bright lights spherical fireball type shape close together high up in the sky and seemed to not be moving, not stars or planes though My name is ((name deleted)) i am 28 yrs old and have lived in the philly area for three yrs now. i was born and raised in maryland. I'm now attending college for culinary arts. I have lived in a high rise penthouse apartment for almost 27 months now. What I saw this morning was different then anything I have ever seen in my lifetime. I've seen shooting stars from my apartment balcony which faces southwest. I look out my huge window daily and nightly to catch glimpses of the beautiful philly skyline that i have from my apt. I can see the airplanes turn and descend then land at the airport from my apt. Especially on clear nights I can see them coming and going extremely well as they pass back behind the skyline.Another thing is I'm constantly checking outside for good shots to take of the changes in the season with the leaves and the city with my digital camera. This morning at around five am I got out of bed to get a drink of water, as I was pouring the water I was thinking to myself what a cool night it was and how it was probably really clear out. so I walked over to my balcony window and looked outside as I drank my water. I noticed it was extremely clear out and almost twilight. Although it was still dark out I noticed that it was going to be a clear day to come. I could see the blueness of the sky along with some puffy little clouds about too. As i was looking at the blueness of the sky and thinking to myself how it was pretty amazing how I could see the color in the sky even though it was still dark out. Then I noticed two extremely bright lights that were very close to each other. they were too bright too be planes and on clear nights you can clearly make out the shapes of planes, and also see the flashing lights on most of them. Although it was clear there wasn't much to see of any stars like in the summer time. these were not moving at all, if so very slow then. Not stars, not planes, not a helicopter, these were way too high up for that. They were extremely bright though, I was thinking to myself that someone else must be viewing them also. They were almost as bright as the moon when it is half full. I watched them for about ten minutes looking about thge rest of the sky at the same time looking for stars or planes to try to determine what it could be, I knew it wasn't something normal, it was interesting enough for me not to want to go back to bed, so I proceeded to go and quickly charge my dead video camera battery for a few mins. I then returned to record the footage. They were still there too close together to be airplanes, and besides they weren't moving, but they weren't stars. i taped them for about ten to fifteen mins. I zoomed in on them with my cam. very bright white light surrrounded with what looked like some type of fire or electronic field of energy. Then they both dissapeared for a moment, or so I thought, that's when I noticed that they were indeed moving because they had passed behind a cloud briefly just very very slow. I started to wonder if they could be sattelites or something, but why two so close together, and why did they move so slowly, yet seem to never change the distance between them. Then I thought maybe some type of anti-terrorism patrol craft that the military is testing or something. what better time to do it then 5am when normal working people aren't quite awake yet, and the partiers are sleeping. Not as much chance for someone sighting it. I've seen numerous planes in the sky flying about the city around a month ago with what looked like spotlights on them flying around the philadelphia skyline, but they were moving quickly enough to tell that they were defintly moving. They also were much, much closer to the ground. These I don't know what they were. In read some other ufo reports and there is one on sept. 23rd 2004 in Hartland that sounds very similar to the two objects that I saw. I remeber starting to get tired after watching them for about thirty minutes and turned the camera off and went to bed. I should have stayed up to finish watching them but was too tired. Please respond to me and let me know if anyone else has seen what I saw. thanks ((name and number deleted))  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD));39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

I was sitting out side having a smoke and I was looking at the stars now. I am not one to believe in other life forms but the star shook and dashed away as if it was a bullet.. zoom it took off and its to far to see anything because I am on earth but looking up and seeing that really bright star move so fast makes me think again what was it really.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Orange size Fire-like Glowing Sphere in Pennsylvania July 30, 2011.;2011-07-30 09:00:00;1-2 seconds;Orange size Fire-like Glowing Sphere in Pennsylvania July 30, 2011. I just heard you on C2C talking about July 30th in Pennsylvania and was quite excited.  I left my house just before 9PM on July 30th 2011 to ride to the store a couple of blocks for my house.  As I was approaching the store, I saw something flying down in the manner that a plane descends.  It was coming towards me very fast and as I concentrated my vision on it, it changed to a horizontal flight just about 20 feet above in front me and just flew right over my head.  It was about the size of an orange and looked almost like a glowing liquid fire, yellow orange in color.  It had no tail/trail.  I stopped my bike and by the time I placed my foot on the ground and turned around, it was gone.  I looked around and there was no sign of anything.  There was no sound at all.  There was a couple a few hundred feet behind me and I waited for them to reach me to see if they looked like they saw something, and it seems they didn't.  I mounted my bike and proceeded to the store. It! was 9:04 pm when I reached the store.  The whole event took place within a second or so. I am currently unemployed but I am a 6th Degree Black Belt in Classical Martial Arts of Okinawa and China.  I do not take drugs, do not drink alcohol and have no reason to lie. In fact, I posted the event on my Facebook as soon as i got back home.  My facebook name is Juku Cho.  Look for me and send me a friend request.  I'll accept you so you can see my post and my friend's responses.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
2 fireball objects over philly.;2013-10-03 23:00:00;2 minutes;2 fireball objects over philly. Watched what I thought was a comet for about a minute move a little slower than a passenger airplane then realized how cloudy it was   I thought it was a plane on fire!  Red glowing object that seemed like was pulsating.   Me and wife watched until it became obstructed.  A minute later another one slightly smaller came from same direction at about same speed.  Watched it flicker then disappear going into northern area.   I don't believe in strange things but have not found an explanation.   Chinese lanterns don't go a that fast!

Multiple bright orange objects over Philadelphia.;2014-02-22 19:45:00;15 minutes;Multiple bright orange objects over Philadelphia During a completely clear evening, I observed roughly 12 bright orange objects flying northeast across Philadelphia.   I initially spotted one by itself, which looked very different than normal airline traffic (which is almost non-stop in the airspace over my area).  The object was not blinking and there was no discernible sound.   Immediately afterwards, 4 pairs of the same type of object flew in the same direction/altitude/speed, followed by 3 more that flew over individually.   The strangest part was that some of them seemed to very quickly burn out and disappear before leaving my line of sight. This seemed remarkably similar to a sighting I saw posted on this site in Broomall just a few days ago.  My most logical guess was that these were helicopters at higher than normal altitude, but the lack of any sound has really puzzled me.  I have never seen anything like them.

Me and My Father were on the porch talking, when I noticed an Orange light in the sky. I told my father, he turned around and saw it.   I then grabbed binoculars and aimed them at the object.  It looked like Saturn at first with a ring, then it turned and we saw what looked like a yellow light dropping out of the object.   Then, it went further away from us at fast speeds until it disappeared.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Green fireball. flash green real bright. then flew away faster then anything I ever seen before;2014-10-17 01:00:00;4 seconds;green fireball. flash green real bright. then flew away faster then anything I ever seen before As I was walking home from the Chinese store with a friend, we seen A big bright GREEN ball ascended in to the sky really fast.  Stopped for 2 seconds, Then flashed green real bright.  Then flew away faster then anything I ever seen before.  I was freaking out. Because I am very aware of UFO's n always watch alien documentaries all the time, and I once saw something I thought was a UFO.  But this was very close, only about 3 blocks away I'd say. And its just so (I can't even explain the feeling) to actually witness it first hand, and so close. So had a really bad feeling about it.  Why in Philly?  A largely populated city where a lot of people are still out at 1 am.  That means they are started not to care if see. Which I believe is either a very bad thing.  Or a very bad thing.  No good can come of this. I even posted on a social media about it to see if anyone else seen it.  And my friend said he did. I didn't even give a description of it.  I just asked if anyone s! een that in the sky, and he said I seen it. It was a greenish light rite.  It flashed and I was waiting for the boom.  I almost ((deleted)) panicked .  I'm just so overwhelmed and needed somewhere to vent where I wouldn't sound crazy.  Cause like they all say I know what I saw;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

Lights floating in distant sky east of Philadelphia, PA;2015-02-28 23:15:00;5-10 minutes;Lights floating in distant sky east of Philadelphia, PA Observer:  Defense Contractor for US Military  Event:  My son and I attended the NHL Hockey game in Philadelphia between the Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers on 28 February, 2015, at the Wells Fargo Center.   While departing the game after it ended, at approximately 2315 at night, we observed multiple orange lights, perhaps 5-7 lights, in the distant Eastern sky, at an angle above the horizon, between approx. 35 and 15 degrees.  They reminded me of military flare used to illuminate the ground when shot into the sky or dropped by an aircraft.   They were in different heights and fairly close to each other in a vertical line.  There was some stagger to their order as they were not in a straight vertical line.   After watching for 2-5 minutes, they dimmed and then disappeared, while staying in the same spot in the distant sky.  They seemed to be floating and did not appear to be moving in any direction from our vantage point.  They were in line between the Wells Fargo Center and the flight path of airplanes landing from! east to west at the Philadelphia International Airport as the planes were visible crossing the vertical line of the lights;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
