It was approximately 8 am on 4/3/17   It was a lovely morning and I was looking at the sky and clouds and saw a black object quite high.  I was facing north/northwest.  My first thought was that it was some debris floating on the air currents -  but it was not just floating along  - it was moving quite slowly from east to west.  The object was dark black, shaped like a wide diamond – or a square object on a corner.  It did not appear to reflect light – however I noticed a light that flashed about 4 times in the 10 minutes or so I was looking at it.   I asked a young woman , also waiting for the bus if she saw it – she said yes -  I asked her if it looked like a helicopter?  She said she didn’t think so.  I’m afraid I didn’t get her name, but if I see her again I will ask.  I did try to take some photos – but I don’t believe they show much since the object was so high up and I! ’d think, quite distant.  I can send them if it is requested;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
