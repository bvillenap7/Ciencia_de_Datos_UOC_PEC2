Bright Light over I95 (Philly) which shot off at an incredible speed and angle.;1995-07-21 23:15:00;2-3 min.;Bright Light over I95 (Philly) which shot off at an incredible speed and angle. There were four witnesses to this sighting. Myself, my father-in-law,his friend and his friend's grandson. We were returning home from a Phillies-Cardinals baseball game. We were traveling south on I 95 approximately 2-3 miles before the I 476 interchange (known locally as the Blue Route).  As we were traveling south on I 95 we all noticed a very bright light directly ahead of us on the horizon. Because of our proximity to the Philadelphia International airport, I believe we all assumed it was plane approaching for a landing at the airport. After about thirty seconds I remember thinking to myself,why hasn't the incoming plane closed in distance on us? It seemed we weren't closing the gap. (which I found strange because we were heading directly toward it. And it initally appeared to be coming toward us.) About 15-20 seconds later the gap between us seemed like it was finally closing. I then commented to the child in the group, look here comes a plane in for a landing. Right after that the object shot off to left at an incredible speed on an approximate 60 degree angle. It was totally out of sight in a second or two. We all imediately rolled down our windows and looked up to try and track it. However, it was gone. One of the other witnesses said, Did you see that? It was like it was yanked on a string! That isn't anything from this world!   I also remember was thinking to myself how bright the light was compared to what I remember normal landing lights on a plane to be. It was a brighter and whiter glow than you would normally see.  A final observation. There is a Boeing facility within a mile or two of where the sighting occurred. Was this some sort of experimental craft? I don't know... If it was, I can't rationalize why they would be testing it in such a densely populated area over heavily traveled interstate highway. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, but can easily be confirmed because of the baseball game.  PD));39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
green light looked like rocket exhaust;2001-07-14 21:30:00;2 minutes;green light looked like rocket exhaust My wife and I were getting out of the car when I looked up and saw a green pulsating light moving away from the earth it was large and seemed far away. It looked like it would be rocket or missile exhaust I pointed it out to my wife it lasted for about 1 to 2 minutes. I took my infant daughter into the house and came right back out but could not see it. I have been a star gazer for more than 20 years and have never seen anything like this.

Four balls of light travelling at high rate of speed are chased by 7 high altitude jets.;2002-06-02 16:30:00;30 seconds;Four balls of light travelling at high rate of speed are chased by 7 high altitude jets. The first two objects (round and blue in color)were detected high in a cloudless sky.  At first sight I thought they were stars, but because it was 4:30 in the afternoon and they were moving across the sky, they couldn't be stars.  As I informed the other witness to come look at what I was seeing and pointing out the one object that remained in view, (I lost the other behind trees) a third object, much lower came streaking by. This was a blue ball of light with a halo around it and didn't make any sound. The objects didn't waiver, they just traveled straight, heading east, out to sea.  A couple of minutes later, a fourth object flew by, this one was the same as the third, but it was a yellow color with a halo and traveled the same low path as the third object.  The most important part of the whole experience is that for the next 45 minutes, I counted 7 high altitude jets (possibly military aircraft) travelling in the same direction as the 4 objects.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Sight  with sound & barking dogs!;2002-07-26 22:10:00;2 minutes;Sight  with sound & barking dogs! Myself, along with three fellow Police Officers were outside our headquarters when we noticed a glowing deep green beam of light, 60 - 65 degrees near the zenith. This green beam was stationary, just above the clouds, facing NNE.  The beam was horizontal to our ground and a high pitched, pulsating hum could be heard over the common city noise.  This hum caused the several K-9 dogs to bark and howl uncontrollably from their pens. Holding my hand up to the sky, the beam/glow of deep green light would have been relative to the size of my thumb. After viewing in amazement, for about two minutes, the deep green light vanished, the hum stopped and the dogs became silent. With two airports in the area, I'm sure something had to be picked up on radar screens.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

After about 2 min the flashing light moved to the south in between flashes. then moved back northward back to its origional position.

Large green light traveling at rapid speed across the sky over Philadelphia, PA.;2008-02-06 22:45:00;1.2 sec;Large green light traveling at rapid speed across the sky over Philadelphia, PA. I was driving over the Walt Whitman Bridge heading east and all of a sudden I saw a large bright green light travel across the sky heading north-east. Because I am not positive of the size of the craft, it is difficult to say exactly how high in the sky it was but I would say it was approximately 15,000 feet up. The craft flew over in a path which seemed parallel to the earth, which lead me to believe that it wasn’t any kind of meteor. This certainly wasn’t a glare either…something traveled across the sky at a significantly rapid speed and then disappeared. Whatever it was, it was very large the green light shone like a sunburst and was quite larger than any of the other lights seen on nearby aircraft.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
moving light.;2009-07-07 09:40:00;1 minute;moving light. Tonight while outside on the street I looked to the sky and saw what appeared to be a moving star.  At first I thought that this might be a satellite, since I have witnessed this before.  What set apart this sighting was the fact that the light did not follow a elipitcal flight path across the night sky.  This light followed what would be considered a normal flight path of a plane close to the horizon.  The light was not a airplane since no strobes were observed, and the light maintained a constant level even as it moved away from us.  The speed was constant and no erratic turns were observed.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

To the south/southwest she noticed a big shing light.  At first we thought it might be a satelite, but after further inspection, there is no way it's a satellite.  It was not a helicopter or plane either. We noticed numerour helicopters going to the area it was in, one at a time.  I do not know if they could see it.  We took pictures & a short video (a little dark though).  It was a pretty good night to see the stars, but this light was not nearly high enough to be a star.  Plus it had a cleary visible haze around it.  I would be suprised if no one reports this.......it was THAT noticable & unusual.  I do not know if it was alien, but it is definately unidentifiable to me, making it a U.F.O. for just that reason. C- ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus.

Single white light moving in plane filled sky.;2013-08-24 21:20:00;2 minutes;Single white light moving in plane filled sky We were at an outdoor movie viewing in Clark park in west philadelphia.  It was a beautiful night, the sky was clear and the stars were vivid.  I kept looking up at the sky every time a plane passed by and there seemed to be a lot.  That's when I noticed a moving object heading southwest around 9:20 pm.  It looked pretty much just like a bright white light, and it moved slightly slower than the airplanes.  I noticed it did pass under a plane at one point, carried on for another 15 seconds or so, and then disappeared.  After that I didn't see any planes or other lights in the sky for a good ten minutes.  I was out there from 8:30 pm too 10:00 pm and saw at least 20 planes, all of which had multiple flashing and colored lights on them.  The other object was merely a bright white light which is why I kept sight of it until it vanished.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

I was about to cross the street, but i looked up and noticed a soft white light heading northeast.  Helicopters and planes fly over my area all the time and I can plainly state that this was neither.  It was completely silent and moved very slowly.   I was so taken back by this  light that I leaned against a brick wall to watch its movements.   Just as it was almost over my street, it slowly turned right and began to head east towards the river.   I felt really happy and aloof during and after I witnessed it.  I noticed that it kept getting brighter and dimmer and at one point saw a flicker if and orange light either on the right side or the underbelly of the light.   The light appeared to be circular, but mainly just a slow moving light.  Since I was already feeling crazy, I asked the light to turn on and off so I knew it was really there and I wasn't imagining things, but instead it slowed down directly overtop and in front of me and dropped a smaller white light that flickered down and immediately disappeared, at which point the larger light sped up, turned and orangey- red color, and sped away.   I should also mention that the street went from being filled to nothing during about a 5 minute time frame, and I believe I was the only witness on my street.   After the light passed and I crossed the street, cars and people started showing up again.  There you go!;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

I figured they were airplanes queued up for landing except I realized they were stationary.  They were not stars as they were flickering with high level of clarity as opposed to the way one would see a distant star flicker.  I noticed two of the lights were in sync so I figured then that maybe it was a tower that I just had never noticed before until other lights started to appear.  Some were moving very slowly.  Slow enough to be helicopters drifting as they hovered, but there was no sound and then more appeared.  Some disappeared and the two that were in sync went out of sync.  I noticed a total of about 10 lights.  I used my binoculars to see what I could but could only really make out balls of light as it was dark.  I did notice that at least one light was reddish while the others were mostly white. I went to get my wife to look and by the time she came out, the lights had gone from about 10 back to 2 and then a few planes came through the area and the lights disappeared.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

Each object had a small trail of smoke (different from chemtrails) that dissipated fairly quickly.  The three objects were very far away and it made it difficult to make out a shape.  We did notice each of the three had its own trajectory that appeared to originate from different locations but were traveling towards the horizon were the sun was setting.  They were traveling much faster than the usual plane in the sky.  The one closest to the horizon began to give off a spherical bright white light before it was not visible anymore.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

It had green, red, and yellowish/white lights running across it.  Couldn't tell the shape because it was behind some trees in the distance.   What caught both my wife and I's attention was that the lights returned to a position in the sky where we could see it behind the tree in a swaying manner.  Not typical for an aircraft, and after spending 10 years in the Air Force (Edwards AFB & Pentagon), I knew that was not normal not even for a helicopter to maneuver in such an erratic manner.   We lost sight of the object after it dipped down below the treeline in the distance. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

December 26, 2016.  While on a routine flight from New York to Miami, we saw a very unusual light.  We were in cruise at FL410, Mach .80, unlimited visibility with a temp of -55c, approximately 100NM off the coast near Atlantic City (close to Philadelphia), and on a true course of around 160.  Between 2130-2200 EST. I looked up I saw a very large and bright flashing light, which I brought to the other pilot’s attention.  His response when seeing it was pretty much the same as mine…. “What in the hell”… “What is that?”   The size of course is hard to tell.  The other pilot explains it as 3-4 times the size of the largest star around.  I think it was 4-5x.   The object was approximately 25-30 degrees up from our line of sight when I first saw it.  Its range of motion was between the horizon (from what I could see) to around 35 degrees up from our line of sight.  At first sight the light was approximately at our 1 o’clock position.  It moved to 12, 10, 11, back to 12.  At that time, the light appeared to move North, then south, at a pretty rapid rate.  Or I would describe it as closer and further from our position as the size seemed to get larger and smaller.  The light ended in the 1st position and then moved out east and once at our 10 o’clock position disappeared.  The other pilot stated he could see an! orange/red flash in between the white flashes.   We did flash our lights at it a few times and the other pilot believes it flashed back in sequence, I felt the return flashes were probably coincidental, but possible.  The flashing didn’t really appear to have any pattern.  The whole incident lasted a minimum of 10 minutes. Neither one of use have ever seen and/or heard of an occurrence like this.  We were going to report it to ATC, but mutually decided to let it be.  I have no explanation for what we saw nor does the other pilot.  We did try to video the incident, but it wasn't possible.
