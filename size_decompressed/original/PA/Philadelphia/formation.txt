A v-shaped line of lights moving in unison.;2003-11-08 20:00:00;1-2 min.;I saw the same thing that others in different locations saw on the night of the eclipse. It has been a few weeks since I saw it, so I can only give an approximate time frame of from 8:00 to 8:30pm.  At first I thought it was a flock of birds flying under the moon in v-formation, but then I noticed that the lines of the v did not waver at all.  They stayed completely straight, moving at a uniform speed, which suggests to me that it was part of the same craft.  As if two sides of a triangle were lined with lights.  From where I stood (at 19th and Spring Garden Sts.) it appeared to be moving from north to south.  I noticed that there was absolutely no sound coming from it.  It was a bit cloudy that night over Philly, so I can't verify color.  In fact, I couldn't discern any mass to it at all.  It looked like just a v-shaped line of lights moving in unison.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
sighting in philly south of the city moving west of 3 lights that seemed to be independant, and flying in formation;2004-09-26 22:15:00;5 minutes;sighting in philly south of the city moving west of 3 lights that seemed to be independant, and flying in formation We had just finished dinner at the Moshulu restaurant on the Delaware River in PHilly, and went up to the upper deck to sit a minute.  I was looking over the edge of the boat, and my friend asked me what 'that' was.  i didn't realize what she was referring to at first.  then i spotted three lights, flying in a triangle shape, and thought it could be an airplane comming into the nearby airport.  the lights were south of where we were.  other planes were also flying that night.  it became apparent that it wasn't a single plane when the two lights at the bottom of the formation seemed to weave, move around, perhaps change positions.  the upper light may have also moved, but the bottom two were definitly moving.  the formation was moving west.  we continued to watch, as they seemed to move either further away, or became lost in clouds.  the upper light was a bright white, the bottom two were dimmer or smaller, and of a different hue (blue to red);39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
cluster of lights in good formation traveling high in the sky over South Philadelphia, Pa..  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax??  PD));2006-11-15 21:00:00;5 MINUTES;cluster of lights in good formation traveling high in the sky over South Philadelphia, Pa. above 10th and bigler playground on the night of november 16, 1906 as i was sitting on the bleachers in the park at 10th and bigler streets in South Philadelphia, Pa. and as i lifted my head up in personnal prayer i was distracted momentarily by a bright cluster of lights in the sky above the clouds very high in the air. at first i thought it might be a plane but there were too many lights well formed in the shape of maybe a chevron moving very fast like in and out of the clouds but again very high in the sky. on second look i thought they might be a flock of birds migrating south for the formation was traveling in a southwesterly direction. however on second thought birds don't give off light. these were lights, well formed and bright like stars. i watched them soar through the clouds and finally dissapear from my sight. there were other planes in the area at the time but at a much lower altitude. i watched the skies many times at night time this event really caught my eye and my strict attention. i believe i saw something extraordinary and i have been talking about it since. i even waited to hear about someone reporting on the news or newspapers, but to no avail. hoping to hear something. until then i will keep watching.

UFO seen during June 27th fireworks at Penn's Landing;2009-06-27 21:30:00;1 minute;UFO seen during June 27th fireworks at Penn's Landing During the June 27th fireworks at Penn’s Landing in Philly, my entire family consisting of four people including myself, witnessed an aircraft flying right by the fireworks until it was behind a building where it disappeared.  The craft was unlike an airplane because it had three lights which if you connected with a line would make a triangle.  In addition they were not blinking lights.  It’s hard to say whether the lights were from a single craft or three separate ones. Other members of my family dismissed it as an airplane or helicopter, but I don’t think one would fly right into the fireworks.  Perhaps, I am wrong and the aircraft was very far away and merely looked like it was in the fireworks but that still does not explain its unusual appearance and its abrupt disappearance. I don’t know if anyone else saw it, but someone else should have because there were tons and I mean tons of people out on the waterfront on both the Philly and Camden sides.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
