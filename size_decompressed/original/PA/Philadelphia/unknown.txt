UFO SIGHTING ON 9 / 11 / 01 ---the night of the World Trade Center bombing.;2001-09-11 00:00:00;about 1minute;UFO SIGHTING ON 9 / 11 / 01 ---the night of the World Trade Center bombing. The reason i'm entering this report is, because i'm trying to see if anyone else out there in the same area as me, saw this occurance. It was 9/11 the date of the world trade center bombing...i was hanging out with 2 of my friends talking about the incident that happen during the day..., we were outside my house in the front lawn having a cigarette to close out the night before going to bed....when my one friend pointed out the fact that this is one of the only nights you'll ever see the stars with no planes flying around, cause all air-ways were banned due to the new york bombing..., so were all looking up at the stars like wow......when i notice a brighter than normal star....i thought it was the north star, but then my friend pointed out otherwise, showing me the real north star......so there we were watching this brighter than normal star twinkle, but it started to flash....it flashed a couple of times, and pulsed and then started to zig zag around in the sky...and there was no sound whatsoever..(no engine noise, or anything)..it would zig zag at extreme angles and then stop.....and then zig zag some more.....and at this time....i noticed 3 different colored lights around it...blues and reds, .couldn't tell if the lights were in a triangle position or circuler....but they where definitly spinning around the center brighter star that was flashing and pulsing....we were watching it zig zag around, when all of a sudden in a split second, it beemed across the oposite side of the sky. We almost thought that it disspeared but then saw it flashing at the other end of the sky...By now, we were extremely excited and in shock.....It pulsed a little more, then slowly disapeared like it was fading backwards....then it was gone. About 5 seconds after that 2 fighter jets came roaring from the far side of the sky (it was loud and thunderous) and they circled the area twice before flying away....  and this was all on the night where there was supposed to be NO airplanes in the sky at all..and no aircraft allowed......so me and my 2 friends were completely amazed...  then next day we told everyone..and of course no one believed us....so i write here today to see if any other people in the southern philadelphia suburb area saw this or witnessed it too...i am completely serious about my report....or i wouldn't have taken the time to write this...cause i am an extremely busy person..., and it took me until now, to finally surf the net to try to find out if others had seen the same thing that night on 9/11/01;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
3 lights in the sky;2006-12-31 20:30:00;5-10 min.;I was home alone and looked out the window to see if it was raining and i saw 3 lights in the sky really near the clouds, going above the clouds at times. They were flying in circles, not sure if it was 1 object changing lights or three different ones but probably 3. After about 10 minutes I only saw 2 spot lights in the clouds. Freaky!I'm never gonna forget this, BTW it didn't make any noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Bright green light streaked quickly across the Philadelphia sky very early in the morning.;2007-03-27 05:45:00;a few seconds;Bright green light streaked quickly across the Philadelphia sky very early in the morning. Me and my father were getting settled into the van early in the morning as he was getting ready to drive me to the hospital.  I was looking ahead out of the van window, and he was taking the club off the wheel when I saw a bright green light streak across the sky.   My father exclaimed, Did you see that?  It shot diagonally across the sky.   I would have thought that it was a firecracker of some sort, but it was very early in the morning.  It was still dark outside, but it was also very quiet.  If there would have been a noise, I believe it would have carried.   It also didn't leave a trail of smoke the way a firecracker does, and it was very quick.  It was there and then it was gone.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Four solid red lights sighted north of Philadelphia moving south in no particular formation disappeared one by one.;2010-07-01 23:10:00;30 seconds;Four solid red lights sighted north of Philadelphia moving south in no particular formation disappeared one by one. I was sitting on my roof when I saw four red lights in the western distance.  I was looking west over the Schuylkill River. The objects were flying south, possibly southwest.  At first I thought they were incoming planes (like when you see a row of planes following the same flight path) but there was no blinking light, only a solid red light for each object with no discernable flight pattern.  The objects were in no particular formation, they were randomly staggered to describe it best.  From my view they approached from the north making their way into my view from my building which blocked that part of the sky.  They were approaching my next visual obstacle, a tree, when one light seemed to disappear in the distance as if it went straight into the sky or due west away from me.  The other three lights then passed behind the tree.   I waited for them to reappear, but only one came out on the other side and then it too disappeared.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

After it was over there was a shiny orb that moved north.  It looked like a star flying across the night sky.  Absolutely no sound at all, even during the flashes;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

TIGHTLY GROUPED WHITE LIGHTS IN EAST SKY;2015-03-25 00:05:00;30 seconds;TIGHTLY GROUPED WHITE LIGHTS IN EAST SKY Between 12:04 and 12:07 A.M. (not sure) on March 25, 2015, I witnessed the following from my back window in Philadelphia, PA, 19135:   In the East sky at an altitude of approx.. 60—70 degrees perspective from my second story window I saw a hovering set of three to four white lights (TIGHTLY GROUPED) which were parallel to each other and a middle blinking light centered below the other lights.   All lights were approx.. a (-2) apparent magnitude.   I then obtained my 10x50 binoculars and continued to view.  This did not bring about or yield any more detail about the hovering lights.  I could not see any specific structure supporting the lights.  Suddenly, the lights and any evidence they were there disappeared. There one second and gone the next!   I’m an amateur astronomer and familiar with aircraft navigation lights.  The entire duration of this sighting was about 30 seconds.   Any time I see and record spacecraft during the night I can verify that it was a satell! ite by using my software.  This was not the case.  This is a mystery.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

Very low dark slow moving object.;2017-11-11 18:40:00;Moments;Very low dark slow moving object. Second sighting in 2 days, different craft.  Approximately 6:40 P.M. I Observed what can only be described as a gigantic dark, slow moving, silent object that’s only distinguishing feature was the reflection of the street lights on its surface.   As it continued to move N to N-E, I lost its outline as a result of the bright street lights.  It was very low to ground.   Moments later 2 helicopters seemed to fly over the exact area.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Two shimmering objects in the morning sky hovering 100 feet apart very high up;2019-06-24 09:30:00;30;Two shimmering objects in the morning sky hovering 100 feet apart very high up My bud and I were out smoking and he looked up in the sky and saw two shimmering objects in the sky above our building.  They were about 100 feet apart n hovering really high up.  They were too small to tell what shape they were.  They were moving across the sky very slowly keeping their distance the same between them.  It was in the morning as well.  They must have been spinning because we could see the reflection of the sun on them every couple of seconds.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

Two black sphere-shaped crafts were hovering in the sky after a massive thunderstorm . The clouds cleared up there were those two figures slowly moving around from left to right.  We thought they were drones, but we saw a drone pass by and could easily rule that out as an option.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
