We looked up, and saw what I thought was an oval object in the sky.  We came up to the corner and my husband ran up the street and got his father, who came down to the corner.  We watched for several minutes until it went over the horizon.  Approximately 20 minutes later my husband, son and I continued on our journey.  At approximately 11st and Olney Ave we again saw the same object.  It was a lot closer, and hovering.  What I remember is that it was enormous.  It had windows (I think) and lights going around.  There was no noticable noise coming from it.  We parked our car and watched the object for approximately 10 minutes.  Then, as weird as it sounds, we got bored and decided to go on our journey assuming that we would read about it in the newspaper the next day.  The next day, the Philadelphia newspaper had an article about a citing of a UFO near Baltimore Pike, which is probably 20 miles from where we saw the object.  My memory is that the object was more circular or oval however, my huband remembers it as cigar shaped.  I think that it was a silver metallic color.  It was hoving over a very congested area of the city.  People were walking on the sidewalk, but I did not notice anyone else looking up, and we did not tell anyone to look up.  Another odd thing is that after that night, none of us spoke of this for many years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Oval shaped moon colored object that darts in and out of the clouds above my house,;1988-10-16 09:30:00;1 hour;Oval shaped moon colored object that darts in and out of the clouds above my house, The object resembled the color of the moon.  It did not look like it lights on it. It flew back and forth, in and out of the clouds in a very rapid motion. At times, it seemed to stop and hover in a certain spot as if it were surveying a particular part of the sky. Then after a few seconds, it would zoom back and forth between the clouds again. This date was my first sighting. I am still seeing this unidentifiable object. I saw it again this morning in the same location. However, the time that I saw it this morning was much later than previous times. It was about 1 AM this morning. This is definitely not an airplane search light, flashlight, taser or anything of that nature. I fully well know the difference. I watch the skies often, and I've never seen anything like this before. I do find the experience quite exciting.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
The ufo that closely observed college students on campus.;1997-07-14 05:20:00;5 minutes;The ufo that closely observed college students on campus. Well, I was in high school then working as a counselor for younger students on a college campus in Pennsylvania.  It was approximately five twenty in the afternoon and it was time to get off work. Me and my friends were joking around with the younger students just joking and laughing.  I myself just happen to look in the sky because at that time the college campus had rows of trees where bird would gather and fly over people heads.  As I looked up I happen to notice a airplane then my eyes looked a little lower and I seen another airplane nothing out of the ordinary.  Furthermore, as I looked at the second airplane my eyes focused on a object that was in the air with no movement.  The first thing I did was stop everyone from talking and get them to look at the object in the air.  I noticed there was nothing attached to it and it was like it was observing the college campus.   My peers all notice the object and I think it noticed us because it started to move. The object was oval and it moved very slowly on the left of the object was a green light flashing from side to side then on the right side was orange light flashing from side to side it was sunny and clear as day outside.  The object was a good distance away but it was so clear outside with no buildings blocking our view we could all see the object in clear view. Then the object moved so fast it just disappeared before our eyes. I have never seen anything like that in my life and I just wanted to share my experience.

Silent, oval, bright white craft in yard.;2008-10-10 20:00:00;1 minute;Silent, oval, bright white craft in yard. That evening, my son, my husband, and myself were watching tv in our living room. I noticed a light in my backyard and my son and I both went to our sliding glass doors.  What we saw was incredible.  It was an oval shaped craft, completely immersed in a white blue light.  It looked like a single person (being) craft.  It was gliding slowly through our yard, and came within 10 feet of my house.  It was only 5 or 6 feet off the ground.  If we had opened the door we could have touched it. We watched as it cruised past our door, past next door and towards the break between the houses.  I ran to the front door waiting for it to reappear from the break but it never came out.  It had to have gone up.  There was absolutely no sound coming from it.  What was strange was that none of my neighbors claim to have seen it.  My husband must have dozed off because he didnt see it.  My son who was 25 at the time didnt believe in UFO's until that night.

We were on my friend's rooftop deck in Philadelphia, PA, and I suddenly hear my friend say, Is anyone looking at this right now?   I quickly turn around, and look into the sky and see a bright, white oval shaped object getting brighter as it looked like it was coming closer to us.  As my friend and I observed it for a total of about 3 seconds, the object made a quick hook in the sky and disappeared.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

The outline/shape of the disk and the lights underneath were very clear but the disk seemed colorless!;2017-05-10 21:45:00;3 minutes;The outline/shape of the disk and the lights underneath were very clear but the disk seemed colorless! Out for evening walk!  SURREAL!  Partial cloudy sky...  Moon behind us....  Out of no where, these flashing lights [red, amber, blue/green] appear in the sky, and this craft starts doing cartwheels, and other maneuvers!  It was at the lowest level of clouds but seemed no more than 300-500 feet above our heads!  Going straight [NE], then immediately turning left goes a short distance and comes back to the right doing unbelievable wobble type moves while going in UNPREDICTABLE directions! VERY FAST!  Then takes off going W/NW and disappears into clouds!  As it takes off doing wobbly type maneuvers and lights flashing clear & bright a jet begins to streak across the shy from the direction the ufo came from and is on a straight line path towards this space craft but it never catches-up!  My wife and I both saw this very clearly!  Her eyes are MUCH BETTER than mine.....  I saw one craft [ship?] that was about the size of the moon and somewhat changed shape [round to oval] as it performed half-cartwheels, left to right.  My wife saw this and a smaller craft interact.
