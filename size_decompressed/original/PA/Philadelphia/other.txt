Smaller craft came out of a slit in the sky above the roof tops in a residential neighborhood.  It was a darker brushed metal color.;1978-06-01 20:00:00;1 hour;Smaller craft came out of a slit in the sky above the roof tops in a residential neighborhood.  It was a darker brushed metal color. Because it was such a long time ago, I am not quite sure the month of my siting, but I was with my girlfriend and it was the spring/summer of 1978.  We were starting 9th grade in the fall.  The location was northeast Philadelphia around the neighborhood of Tacony. Somewhere in between our two houses we were walking and saw an unusual light in the sky.  It wasn’t a star or a plane because it was moving erratically but was controlled.  For example the light moved from right to left a distance of several blocks in a second.  Then we saw it move north to south in a distance of several blocks in a second.  And so on.  We started running around the neighborhood following it. Somehow we found ourselves quite a distance from our houses, we were standing by a neighborhood school near Vandyke Street in Philadelphia.  It was a catholic school I believe.  We were looking up in the sky and we lost sight of it.  Suddenly, the craft came out of an invisible slit in the sky if that makes any sense.  The entire thing didn’t appear at once, it was as if there was an invisible door or envelope in the sky and something was coming through it. Now, it was not far up in the sky, it was about equal to the second floor of a row house.  Right above the roofs.  I did not find the shape described in the form that you have.  The best way I can describe it is if you put your two thumbs together and your index fingers together.  It’s sort of a square shape that was sanded down at the edges to make it more rounded. The color of the metal was something I had never seen before, the best way I can describe the color is like a brushed metal, not shiny.  It was a darker color.  There were no lights on the craft at this time.  When we saw it in the sky it was a light.   There was also no sound. As soon as I saw it coming out of the invisible slit in the sky I took off running behind the school building after I picked my bottom jaw up off the ground &#61514  My friend stood frozen and just stared up at it.  I was peeking around the building looking at her. I don’t remember much after that except we walked home.  I was very late coming home.  It only seemed like an hour but I cannot remember what time I got home.  My mother was extremely angry with me especially when I insisted for days that I saw an unusual object in the sky which I followed and that was the reason I was late.  Actually for years after I insisted but everyone just laughed at me. It is strange but my friend and I never talked about what we saw after that.  You would think we would. I do not remember having any contact with any type of being.  I moved out of Philadelphia later that summer to another state but have since moved back to Pennsylvania but not Philadelphia. In my thirties, sometime late 1990s or 2000, I was home alone and I woke up, saw what looked like a strange being with a big head standing in my bedroom door way staring at me, I started screaming and then must have fallen back to sleep.  I’m not sure if I was dreaming or not. I never reported this at the time of my siting because I was young, and no one believed me.  I listened to you on Coast to Coast and you mentioned that you would welcome reports of sitings despite how long ago it may have happened.  Thank you.

Dull black metallic oddly-shaped floating craft;2006-02-03 14:00:00;5 minutes;Dull black metallic oddly-shaped floating craft From 10th floor of a 15 story building, I saw a dull black metallic craft, oddly shaped, like a truncated drag-race funny car.  About the size of a small truck or large SUV.  Floated erratically but swiftly over west part of city, at an altitude of about 120-150 feet. No noise could be heard coming from the object. It proceeded to the south, where it hovered for approximately 3 to 4 minutes. My attention was distracted by an approaching helicopter, and when I looked back, the craft was simply not there anymore.  Later in the day, about 5 pm, I saw an unmarked black helicopter hovering in the approximate area the craft had been in earlier.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
UFO Noise;2006-08-07 01:00:00;Random;UFO Noise For the past two weeks there has been a random unfamaliar noise coming from the woods. It sounds like nothing I have ever heard before, almost like a low pitch storm warning sound. It is coming from the woods which are pretty much desolate and vast. I called 911, and the operator told me a few officers reported hearing it, but none of them knew what it was. None of our neighbors could figure out what it was. I am a cement mason, and I am famaliar with the sounds of different machines, and the sound is neither machine nor human. It happens at random times throughout the day but at nighttime it gets real eerie and loud. The other night I came home at 4am and it sounded like it was above my roof at my house. I was seconds away from calling the cops. I do not know what is back there, but to my understanding if it is not human or machine, it just might be E.T.. or Jesus???;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

Upon hearing it I went outside to see if everything was okay, I live near the Philadelphia airport as I looked up to the sky, the direction would be the incoming flight path for planes coming in for landing) I saw a black, oblong object spiraling almost twirling downwards towards the airport.  It's cloudy out today, but I saw the object in clear view.  I saw no smoke or flames, at 12:50pm I saw three double-blade black helicopters fly in the same direction as this object.   I called the airport emergency line at 215-937-3111 and asked asked them if they had any recent air distress calls, the male stated no, I told him what I saw and he put me on hold he came back a minute later said he can't confirm any of the information and that if I wanted I could make a noise complaint.   I have never heard nor seen anything like this in my life, I would love to know if you get any other reports.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Men in black are real, no one can tell me otherwise.;2007-06-30 01:00:00;3-5 minutes;Men in black are real, no one can tell me otherwise My first strange encounter. A past girlfriend of mine has been evicted from her north Philadelphia apartment, with no where for her to go, I ask my grandmother, Can my girlfriend spend the night with us, since she has no where go?  My grandmom replied, No, she cannot stay here, which led to me and my girl leaving the house together and getting into her 1993 Buick lasabre that was parked at the very beginning of the block.  We could not figure out where to go at that time, so we both ended up dosing off and falling asleep in her car with the seats reclined back. To my surprise I wake up from hearing an aggressive knock at the dark tinted passenger window beside me.  The knock was similar to the way a police knocks on your window at a regular traffic stop.  I turned my head towards the window, I look up and see an Asian like man with very dark pitch black eyes, both of his eyes were black like some sort of demon staring right at us.   I reach for the handle to open the door and approach this strange looking person, and my girlfriend pulled back on me saying, Don't get out of the car, why ((profanity deleted)) do his eyes look like that?  In a scared tone.   So me playing the brave guy role at the time, ignoring my girlfriend I get out of the car anyway and approach this person.  Feeling slightly dizzy and drowsy like I would normally waking up out of a short sleeping session.  I'm literally standing about two feet away from this guy, directly looking into his eyes, thinking to myself, This is one ugly strange looking ((profanity deleted)).   His skin was so pale which made him look even weirder. He was dressed in a black tight fitting long sleeve black shirt, with black cargo pants and black footwear, and he was built like a small Asian guy with Asian like features.  The closer I'm moving towards him, the more jumpy this guy is acting but not in a aggressive way, more like a defensive way as if I was going to attack him. I ask him  what's the problem?  And he responded in a soft low tone saying, Yea, man just go home.  I replied back wiping my dreary eyes still feeling dazed saying, I live on this block.  Then he replied for the second time saying yea I know, just go home man, like he was trying to help me out.  So I asked feeling slightly disturbed and annoyed saying so what are you a cop or something?  Then he replied back somewhat studdering with a slight snicker saying  ye yea I'm a cop.   I said ok as the guy turns his back to me and walk towards this vehicle that's double parked crookedly in th! e street I'm also stunned by the vehicle he gets in.  It's a white Hyundai, not just any average white Hyundai.  This was one of the most amazing, cleanest, spotless vehicles I've ever seen in my life at the time.  They look similar to the way they look now in 2015 but this was back in the 2007 or 2008 time period. The headlights on the car were extremely bright shining down the block opposite of me.  I mean these light were bright, and he was driving alone because I noticed no one else in the vehicle.  I got a good look of the front of the car and seen the tilted H symbol on the grill of the car.  That last how I know it wasn't a Honda, this was a Hyundai.  It was like a car in the future to me back then, and how they look now reminds me of this encounter every time I see one ride past. He then sped off down wyncote avenue and I got back in the car with my girlfriend.  She's asking me what did he say?  I tell her that he must've been an undercover cop and her car probably matched the description of another car used in a crime in my neighborhood.  With that said I flagged the situation away like it was no big deal and continued the rest of the night out with my girlfriend. What puzzles me about this, is the fact that no police badge was present at the time, no walkie talkies, no back up no weapon.  This guy was very gentle but intimidating.

Then to my complete surprise, the thing made itself known as it flew at rooftop level over the houses of Philadelphia just one small block north of my location it was in the shape of a boomarang with six white lights , three under each segment.  It was not very thick maybe 10 or 15 feet. Ieasily make out the plastic housing for each light as well as the gray superstructure of the craft it was dusk with just enough light to make out detail.

While reviewing the reports filed @ NUFORC for PA, I saw that in June 2009 there was the report of a H-shaped object filed that was seen near Pittsburgh.  My wife saw the same craft just last year but in Philadelphia. My wife was on her way home from work @ 23:45 and while she was stopped at a stop sign she noticed the craft in the sky hovering just above the tree line above the park behind our home.  The craft looked like a Tie-Fighter from Star Wars with 4 white lights on the near side & at least 2 white lights on the far side of the craft with a red light in the middle of the craft.  She lost sight of the craft behind some large trees.   When she got home several moments later she came out on our deck & asked me if the Police Helicopter was hovering in the area scoping out the park & I said about 45 minutes ago, but not lately.  My wife proceeded to tell me what she saw since I am a MUFON Field Investigator to see what my take was.  We proceeded to drive @ the neighborhood retracing her footsteps and to see if it could have been lights reflecting off her windshield and came up with nothing.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
2 stars moving together separated by a distance of about 8 inches.;2009-01-09 18:19:00;one minute;2 stars moving together separated by a distance of about 8 inches. I was outside with my neighbor drinking beer in my yard. I saw Venus and several stars. Two of the stars I saw were moving together very slowly. The only reason I noticed this was because I saw them through the branches of a tree in my yard and watched them get blocked out by the bare limbs. I brought what I saw to my neighbors attention and he too couldn't explain it. It looked like one bright star and one dimmer start moving with it. It was the weirdest thing I have ever seen, but I didn't see any structure at all. It seemed to be higher than the thin clouds that were forming and we were able to watch it for about a full minute before they both vanished. Is there a place I can report this and also check to see if anyone else saw it? By the way, I live near 5th St. and Cheltenham Ave.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

2 objects moving together across the sky during the day.;2012-07-04 05:00:00;1-2 minutes;2 objects moving together across the sky during the day. I was on the roof deck sometime late afternoon. The sun was starting to set but there was still plenty of light out. I happened to look up and saw 2 shapes in the sky.  I was looking toward the DE river, with the Philadelphia skyline to my left. There were 2 objects moving right to left across the sky. They did not appear to change speed or elevation, or their position in relation to each other. They moved across my field of view over the course of about 1-2 minutes.  I did not know how big they were so I could not judge how far away they were. The first object was sort of in the shape of an E with the E facing down at the ground.  It did not change orientation at any time.  The second object was in the shape of an elongated cylinder that was oriented horizontally relative to the ground.  It did not change orientation either. Both of the objects were the same color... I would describe it as a brushed stainless steel... there was no appearance of a polished finish. They did not behave like balloons.  They moved with very little change in elevation, and did not appear to move with the breeze.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

It stood out even more in the fact that it was so far away and high, yet still was of a decent size and vividness.   I pointed it out to my toddler, and then within a few more seconds, it went behind a cloud. I did not see it again, although I tried waiting for its to pass the cloud.

4 Bright White Cigar/Long Disc Shape - Traveling Slanted in sky - Dissapeared & Reappeared 3 jets chasing them -Witnessed by 2 in car;2016-11-05 17:15:00;4 minutes;4 Bright White Cigar/Long Disc Shape - Traveling Slanted in sky - Dissapeared & Reappeared 3 jets chasing them -Witnessed by 2 in car On Saturday, November 5th, 2016, roughly some time between 5:15-5:45 PM EST, myself (driving) and another male occupant (passenger) in a moving car traveling South on  Route 1 in Northeast Philadelphia witnessed 4 objects in the sky that appeared to have either been being chased or observed by 3 military jets. It was at that point in the late day, when the sun is just starting to go down, so it was still very bright outside.  The sky was extremely clear, and there was not a  single cloud in sight anywhere to be seen. As I was driving South on Route 1 in Northeast Philadelphia, I was passing right at the area of Route 1 (Roosevelt Boulevard) and Oxford Avenue, and I was in the far  left lane of the middle lane. I just happened to look up at the sky in front of me and to the left, when I noticed what I right away assumed to be just a white cloud  stationary and not at all moving up in the sky. After passing Oxford avenue, I got stuck at the next traffic light.  I kept looking at the object and noticed that it was not moving at all, and that there were no  clouds anywhere in the entire sky.  As I kept staring at it, I thought it was a very starge looking cloud, and then very quickly realized it was not a cloud at all. When I realized this was not a bird, cloud, or an airplane or helicoptor, or any known aviation object I have ever seen before, I asked my passenger, Do you see that  up there?, What is that?  He was amazed just like me and we sat in traffic for about 30-90 seconds just staring at it. It was not moving at all, niether were we.  That  is how we know it was not moving. I was driving, and because we both were staring in confusion at just what exactly we were looking at, it never occured to either one of us to get a photo of it with  our phones.  I'm not sure it would have turned out anyway. We started driving again, and I could see it starting to move downwards, or in the direction coming closer to  the ground.  But it was very, very high up in the sky, and it was oviously very big. In front of me and to the left there were high trees, and we both lost sight of the object for a few seconds, then we saw it again after passing the trees off the side  of the road.  We came to another traffic light and were stopped.  And then thats when we could see it more clearly, and we had the trees as an eye-sight-marker, as the  object was in back of the foreground trees in our sight. So once we were stopped we could clearly see the object more visible in detail and how it was movong and traveling using the tree as a marker. It kept moving downward in back of the trees, and as soon as we started driving again, when we got out in the open more where the sky was more open and visible, thats when we saw them. 3 more  of the same exact kind appeared out of nowhere to the left of the first object we saw. We dont know if they were already there and were just obscured by the trees or not, but I only saw the one at first, when the viewable sky was all open for my vision. And like I stated above, it initially was not moving and was actually closer.  The more we drove in it's direction (South) the further away it became.  It was oviously  movong very fast. There were a total of 4 objects in the sky, and they were all the exact same shape and white-brightness, still not known if it was the sun refecting off the object, making it so bright during that time of day, at least thats how I percieved what I was looking at. My passenger said that the other 3 to the left just dissapeared and  then reappeared right in the air.  I did not see that myself. The Description of the Object: - It was a very bright-white, possibly from the sun reflecting off it's surface, and it was either the shape of a cigar, but it was tilted. And when it moved, it  stayed titled, no matter which direction it moved, the tilt stayed. Im not sure about the cigar-shape, but I would describe it more like this: If you took a frisbee  and looked at it directlyin front of you looking at the side, so you not seeing a circle, but the other way, it would look like a sstraight line, but slightly ovaled,  but then on top of that, tilt it so that the left end it pointed down and the right end is pointed up. There were no colors or visible features, but it was also very high and far away to be able to clearly see it. When I thought it was traveling downwards closer to the  ground, I really think it was traveling further away. That is how fast it was moving. It, and the other 3 just kept getting smaller and smaller, you could tell they  were moving very fast. And as it moved, like I mentioned, the tilt of the object never changed. Still driving, I looked to the right up in the sky to see if there were more of these things, and that's when I saw, very, very high up, 3 jets/planes of some kind,  looked to be classic silver/metal in color of a jet, traveling in the same direction as the objects. All 3 jets were moving what seemed to be slow compared to the  other 4 objects. Each jet was leaving a clear small air vapor behind itself which quickly dissapated. As soon as I turned my head away from the 3 jets to the right sky, I watched the 4 objects to the left start moving extremely fast, as if they just caught wind of the  3 jets coming their way. If these were, oviously, military jets sent up to observe or chase these objects, they would most likely have been sent from Willow Grove Air  Force base in Warminster, Pennsylvania, which was roughly 20 miles away from our driving location. They must have gotten there quick, because when I first looked  around after seeing the first object not moving at all, I saw nothing else anywhere. And the 3 jets were pretty high up. At this point we both observed the 4 objects, which seemed to be each about 2 miles apart from each other, and the other 3 further ahead now from the 1st object we  witnessed, traveling at great speed, still with the tilt not changing at all, all 4 objects within 3 seconds, just took off southbound at incredible speed, and then  they just dissapeared over the horizon. To describe the 1st object, as it was stationary and not moving in better detail, it just hung in the sky, like a cigar, tilted, shining very bright white, as if the  sun was reflecting off it, I am pretty good at judging distance with my eyes, so just a guess, I would say it was about 1-2 miles in length, and roughly about 5-6  miles away. I really wish I could have got a photo of it when is was just sitting there in the sky, but I was driving and it all happened to fast. This was the first time for both of us ever seeing an object we could both say was a UFO for sure. If it was a black-project type object, who knows. But we are  absolutely both sure of what we witnessed, and this was not a mistaken known aircraft. And also we both have never seen such a thing, or expected to ever see such a  thing in this area of Northeast Philadelphia where we were at the time. The entire thing was very strange.  We did look around at other drivers to see if they were looking up at it too, and we did not see anyone looking at it.  Although,  people were driving, it would have been hard to have witnessed it, unless you were stuck at a light, and just happened to look up. I even had my window rolled down with my head out the window, so I know my vision was not obscured in anyway.  That was it.  The objects vanished once they took off  southbound at an incredible high rate of speed, staying at their tilt in the sky, and 30 minutes later, the sun was gone and that was the end of it.  We witnessed nothing else afterwards as we drove in the opposite direction going home.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

On the opposite side of the hill to the fireworks was this tiny green light by itself, not moving.  About every five minutes it would change from green to red.  Then, at one point, a second one appeared near the other one and did the same with the colors changing.   After the grand finale of the fireworks, they turned red and shot across the sky together and onto the side with the fireworks.  Then they slowly went down above the distant treeline and disappeared;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
It was as if they were just playing  games in our night sky again.;2019-01-28 20:40:00;2 minutes;It was as if they were just playing  games in our night sky again. I was called upstairs by 2 granddaughters. Pointing to a double window overlooking my backyard. About 300 ft away is a barn. About 150 ft above the barn were 4 very large (10'x 10') red  glowing orbs, They were just stationary, sitting in the sky. Then all the sudden 2 more red orbs came flying up over the barn. stopped and joined the 4 that actually looked as if they were waiting there for the two to catch up to them. I flew open the window to see if I could hear any propulsion or sounds they or the crafts(?) may be making. Nothing, silence. Then as if they had just noticed the three of us staring at them, 5 took off horizontally in different directions, in a flash, gone. The 6th one, went straight up, in a matter of 3 seconds it illuminated the dark clouds in the night sky as if were day as it past them. So high, so fast and without a sound and then ouyya sight!  Amazing but very scary....;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

I looked up thinking a street light was flickering but when I made eye contact with the light it actually was in the sky.  The sky here is very polluted with other lights and different interferences which usually prevent us from even seeing stars in the sky. Tonight it is very nice and clear but still no stars. I see this square light kind of blue and green at the same time almost like looking at a diamond. It seemed as though it had different facets to it. It changed colors once or twice and I seen a bit of yellow. The square was sitting still when I seen it and in about 2 seconds it started moving extremely quickly. It was moving towards the east at what felt like the fastest thing I've ever seen. I love planes and am very familiar with fighter jets but this thing was crazy. It got so far away so quick that it simply got smaller and smaller until it vanished. It didn't look as though it was moving with the shape of the earth. It looked like it was moving up and out of the atmosphere. It didn't look like it burned out but just got so far away so fast.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
