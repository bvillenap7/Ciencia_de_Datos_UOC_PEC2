Pink Chevron trailed by two smaller craft;2009-07-18 22:00:00;30 seconds;Pink Chevron trailed by two smaller craft Flying from the northwest to the southeast at possibly 10,000 feet, a large triangular or chevron shaped craft with hazy pinkish colored lights, hard to define, moved across the sky at a slow-medium speed with no noise.  This craft was trailed by two smaller craft which appeared as two pinpoints of light, possibly flying higher than the first.  None of the craft made any noise.  The event lasted maybe thirty seconds and three people witnessed it.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Dark, silent, boomerang shaped object seen by 3 in Philadelphia.;2012-12-06 02:00:00;1 minute;Dark, silent. boomerang shaped object seen by 3 in Philadelphia My friends and I were leaving a party at another friend's house around 2 am.  When we walked outside we immediately noticed how bright the stars were and how many of them we could see (We were in north central Philadelphia, near Temple university where even on the clearest nights you can hardly see stars because of the light pollution). We were all just taking a moment to look up at the stars, marveling at our freak ability to see so many. My friend remarked that he could see Orion's belt and that's about when I saw a dark, v shaped formation flying across the sky.  I though at first it was a flock of geese, especially since it was moving south east, but I quickly realized it wasn't. As soon as I said whoah, look at that planet I realized it wasn't a plane at all, there were no lights on it and it was flying very low to the ground (maybe 600 or 700 feet in the air at most) it was also completely silent. (Just to be clear, we live near 2 air ports, we see taking off/landing planes all the time, daily, and this is not what they look like)   As soon as I pointed out the plane, then quickly corrected myself and said wait no, there's no lights on it, hold on.. it was out of sight.  It was moving silently, gliding, but it was moving at a pretty good speed.  My other two friends who had seen it confirmed how strange it was and we tried to run down the street to keep up with it, but lost sight due to the bright street lights and buildings in our way.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
I noticed an extremely bright object ascend from below the horizon at a high rate of speed and in a perfectly straight line.;2017-03-07 21:20:00;>1 minute;I was standing out front of my house, which is located on route 532 in NE Philadelphia, at 9:20 PM (EST).  I was speaking on the telephone when my eyes were drawn to the western sky above Philadelphia.  I noticed an extremely bright object ascend from below the horizon at a high rate of speed and in a perfectly straight line.  The object was made more clearly visible due to its brightness against the fully overcast night sky.   The object stopped its ascension and took an eastern line of flight.  Stopping after approximately 5 seconds of steady travel, the object made a 180° turn at which time it revealed having three bright white lights and one bright green light.  After the 180° turn, the object rocketed in a straight line path back to its original position above the western sky and then descended back below the horizon.   I stayed on the telephone with my fiancé for the entire duration of the sighting, and afterword made a phone call to the above listed hotline number.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
