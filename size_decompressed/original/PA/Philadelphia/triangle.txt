solid black pyramid-like object seen in NE philadelphia sky.;2002-01-01 14:10:00;5 minutes;solid black pyramid-like object seen in NE philadelphia sky. at the time,i had been a security guard at a warehouse in the NE section of philly.there was usually absolutely nothing to do but pace the yard and watch the skies.usually cloud formations, birds, planes, helicopters, stars. this day i had just started my shift, i began my routine pacing. ihad walked toward the warehouse, turned around, and saw what looked like two airplanes flying dangerously close to each other. then i realized that only one of them was a plane. the other thing was just sitting there motionless in the sky. i'm not good with judging distance or size in terms of numbers, but this was close enough that i could almost read the name of the airlines on the side(usair maybe). i watched this object while it slowly started to move and tried to figure out what it could be.it looked like an upside down pyramid except it was three sided. it was solid black,no lights, no markings, no windows, no openings, no visible means of sustained flight jets,nothing. no vapor trail, nothing. i thought maybe a weird balloon maybe, but its speed, altitude and direction remained constant with as much wind as there was.unfortunately there was noone around due to this being a holiday,so i couln't ask anyone if they were seeing this too. i continued to watch this thing, it started to spin while it moved. the spinning got faster. eventually it just vanished. i looked around to see if it shot up into the sky or any other direction. nothing.so i'm left standing there with a million quetions and no answers, one question, was i losing my mind?this was the first in 5 sightings of various unidentifiable objects from that same place. i just want answers.

One sped away leaving a big trail of smoke, i then looked at the other one and it was changing colors and shape, then i took my camera out and took a picture it disapeared leaving an aura behind.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

FIVE FAINT LIGHTS, SORT OF LIKE STAR LIGHTS MOVING EAST DIRECTLY ABOVE ME.  THE LIGHTS WERE NOT BLINKING LIKE ORDINARY PLANE LIGHTS.  THEN IT TURNS SOUTH. I LOST TRACK OF IT IN THE DISTANCE.  IT FLEW IN NORMAL PLANE SPEED. I BELIEVE IT WAS HUMAN MADE BASED ON THE LIGHTS.  CAN YOU TELL IF THERE WAS A STEALTH FLYING IN THE PHILADELPHIA VINCITY ON THAT DAY?  IT COULD HAD HAVE SIX LIGHT ON THE RIGHT SIDE BUT COULD HAVE BEEN A STAR.  I COULD NOT SEE A OUTLINE OF A PLANE.  OF COURSE IT WAS DARK AT THAT TIME OF DAY.

Object(s) over Philadelphia;2007-03-13 19:12:00;20 seconds;Object(s) over Philadelphia Tuesday, March 13th, 2007 at 9:12 PM over Philadelphia, PA.  It was a clear night with access to a dark part of the sky, even with the brightness of the city.  For about 20 seconds traveling in a completely straight line from south to north was a triangular formation of 5 or 6 dull, white, circles.  I noticed them directly overhead and watched until they disappeared in the distance, going out of view.  They didn’t blink, fluctuate in light intendity or have any noise whatsoever.  I constantly see jets fly over heading to Phila. International Airport in one direction, and jets at a higher altitude heading in the opposite direction (going to Lehigh International Airport?).  These spots seemed to be much higher and moving much faster.  There were actually two jets moving within eyesight at the same time, leading me to believe these spots were higher and faster.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

It was headed in a southerly direction and then circled around and went in a northern direction.  As it traveled,the white light at the forward tip blinked out.  I have experienced many sightings but never one this close.  I sky watch as often as I can. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Black triangle with orange glow behind it moving slowly across the sky in a way that defies science.;2007-11-20 20:00:00;30 seconds;Black triangle with orange glow behind it moving slowly across the sky in a way that defies science. While walking to a concert at night, three of my friends and I saw a large black triangle in the sky.  It was moving very slow but seemed to be far away. It must have been massive to be that far and still seem so big.  The triangle wasn't flying like a normal jet would with a point forward.  It seemed to just be sliding across the sky in a way I have never seen before.  There was an orange glow coming from behind it.  The edges were extremely pointed. We couldn't believe what we were seeing.  I just remember looking at my friends to see the reactions on their faces and by the time I looked back at the sky the object was gone.  We heard no noises. One year later I saw the cover of a Flying Lotus (music producer) EP called Reset and the image on the front was exactly what I saw that night.   Years later we still have only told a handful of people because we know none of them will believe us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Boomerang-shaped UFO sighted over Philadelphia at dusk;2008-05-13 18:00:00;5 minutes;Boomerang-shaped UFO sighted over Philadelphia at dusk First I noticed one bright solid amber light approaching from New Jersey (I'd seen it before).  Then, as it got closer, I saw three triangular lights moving synchronously.   Then, after it crossed the Delaware River, I saw CLEARLY six white lights(three on each segment of the wing) attached to the bottom of a V shaped craft, moving very slowly, at almost rooftop level, only one block from my top floor apartment's location.   It made no sound there was no electrical interference of any kind, the height of the object was small (@10 feet) defenitely not capable of carrying a crew I got the impression it was a reconnaissance probe taking video of the city that passed underneath it.   Unfortunately I didn't have my Sony Handycam in-hand or I'd have the video to prove this sighting to you.   Also, you should know that this came one month after I observed a parabolic-shaped craft on April 13, 2008, and was reported to MUFON later.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Double set of pinpoint red/orange steady lights viewed at 200 feet distance, definitely craft.;2008-07-14 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;Double set of pinpoint red/orange steady lights viewed at 200 feet distance, definitely craft. At 10 PM, I noticed an unusually bright, low altitude, slow moving light over New Jersey (I live near the Delaware River and my apartment looks towards NJ). I thought at first that it must be a plane, but as it got closer, I noticed it wasn't blinking.This is when it gets scary.It got close about 200 feet away vertically I saw clearly double row of red/orange lights they were spaced apart at regular intervals three on one side, and three on the other, with a secondary set above that craft was clearly visible! It moved very slowly, maybe 10 mph. It continued it's straight line motion continuing west. In terms of city blocks, it was just one block northward.These lights never blinked. I have been trying to get confirmation from Atlantic City International and Northeast Philadelphia Airport, but noone noticed anything.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
the color of lights cannot be duplicated for a reason i cannot pinpoint. STRANGE;2009-02-18 01:45:00;3 min;the color of lights cannot be duplicated for a reason i cannot pinpoint. STRANGE this is the second time in a 4 month period that i observed this exciting event. oddly enough both times were heavy overcast with very light rain and late in evening while walking dogs in a local state  park that is densely wooded. the dogs were even aware of the ufo hovering above us. at first it appeared as if it was only about 100 feet above us. at first i counted 4 lights giving it the shape of a triangle with the forht one in the center. the ufo had no sound yet my ears felt like they were ready to pop like when reaching a high altitude. the dogs felt discomfort as well. i never seen them lay down and cover their eyes. VERY STRANGE.my body had a feeling of extreme pressure in my chest as well. the lights were dim as if only emitting 50 watts and were like a yellow/orange with a pulsating look. i have never seen anything quite like this before. the odd part at the end of the sighting was both objects seem to have colided with each other to become one and then took off at the most incredable speed in one direction, only to stop after reaching a distance of about 200 feet and then coming back as if to get another look at us and then vanished.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
I think it's important that Air Traffice from the Airport seem to stop during the display.;2010-04-20 21:00:00;Approx.3 Hrs.;I think it's important that Air Traffice from the Airport seem to stop during the display. This was relayed to me, today, by my brother, who lives a couple of miles from the Phila Intn. Airport.  During the sighting, air traffic seem to  cease. He said the objects, triangle shaped,  seem to circle one another and had pulsing lights. There was no sound. They finally got a camera (evidently a small one and took a short video) I viewed the video on Youtube and it is not very good. He did say that his daughter then took a still photo with the flash on and that one of the objects flashed back. My brother, has lived in this house, near the airport, since his birth and stated that these were not any aircraft he had seen before, except for a similar sighting a year or two ago. He did call some of the local news stations. If you want to talk to my brother or one of the other witnesses, please email me, and I will forward your request.

Orange Objects Ascending Over Philadelphia;2013-11-21 19:45:00;~5 minutes;Orange Objects Ascending Over Philadelphia. On the evening in question I was traveling northbound on 95 approaching the Aramingo avenue exit.  I saw to my right several slowly rising objects from the northeast in my peripheral vision.  I then focused my attention to the objects. I counted approximately 12-15 of them.  The objects appeared to be triangular in shape with a solid orange color.  There were no visible navigation, beacon, or strobe lights, which are required on all civilian aircraft, and usually on military aircraft as well.  I did not hear any sound from the objects, although I was traveling at highway speed and only briefly put the window down.  The objects slowly gained altitude.  I would estimate from approximately 150 ft AGL up to 12-1300ft AGL at which point I lost visual reference due to traveling in the opposite direction. They appeared to originate from an approximate heading of 040º magnetic on an outbound of approximately 235º toward the downtown area.  It appeared as if they remained in a tight formation of 2-3 craft in front, at a slightly higher altitude, 4 in a roughly arrow formation, and the remainder flew in sequence.  The overall formation reminded me of the uneven arrow which geese fly in when heading south for winter.  My passenger also witnessed the event and she continued to maintain visual reference while I returned my attention to driving.  I could see the objects in the rearview mirror for approximately 2 more miles until I exited the motorway.  Sky conditions on the evening in question were approximately 8 miles visibility, no cloud bases, and a light (&lt5knots) wind.  There was no snow on the ground at the time, there was no snow falling at the time, nor were there reports of snowfall in the area.  I reviewed temporary flight restrictions, which would notify airmen of any launches or abnormal flight operations, and found none for the evening in question or the surrounding week.  My background is in aviation, and this is unlike anything I have seen in my career.  The lack of sound and slow speed makes me of the opinion that it was not a formation of fixed wing aircraft.  The lack of sound, abnormal lighting, and elevation also makes me skeptical that it could be a helicopter fleet.  I have made this report several months after the fact only because I did not get around to it and also because I have recently seen several videos online, from Philadelphia, which show almost exactly what I saw.  Having seen those, my opinion is even more so that what I saw was indeed abnormal. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Three lighted object in triangle shape.;2014-12-29 06:30:00;5 minutes;Three lighted object in triangle shape. In the back of our home in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia.  It was still dark, and I went to let the dog out because it was barking abnormally.  It never barks at this time, I simply thought it had to go relieve itself.   I opened the door and I heard a loud buzz, looked up and saw three lights in a triangle form.  They moved east very fast, but still within my sight line, then back west very fast and stopped in the air, I actually rubbed my eyes and looked back, screamed for the dog to come back, then went up to get my wife, she saw the same thing, this time we watched from our second floor balcony.  And they were making strange movements, nothing like an aircraft I have ever seen or known about.  Very odd experience.   We recorded it on my wife's cell phone.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

Flying from the west to the east above the tree line I saw a large, triangular shaped object edged with a line of blue lights, and below them, a line of red lights.  The lights did not look perfectly parallel to each other.   They angled away from each other to create a strange angle between what looked to be two surfaces.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
V/Triangle-shaped, silent craft near Philadelphia on 1/10/21;2021-01-10 20:00:00;5 seconds;V/Triangle-shaped, silent craft near Philadelphia on 1/10/21 While stargazing one evening, as I do with family nearly every night, I witnessed a massive V-shaped craft silently traveling north to southwest for roughly 5 seconds.  I cannot gauge how close it was in 1000s/ft but it appeared very large and I cannot express how dead silent it was as it flew past.  I have never seen anything like that before which prompted my searches for similar experiences.  The V was dark colored with dim running lights along the edges.  Most interesting, in addition to its silence, was that it appeared like light was bending around the body of the V (imagine a triangle shape where the “V” was visible like a silhouette but the stars behind it were visible though stretched/distorted as it flew.  It seemed to appear exactly when near-perpendicular to my vantage point and then it disappeared once at a certain viewing angle.  No photos were taken as it was a brief moment.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
