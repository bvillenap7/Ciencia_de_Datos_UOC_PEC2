Strange globe sighting--1969.;1969-07-04 01:30:00;20 minutes;Strange globe sighting--1969. Thank you for allowing me to share my own story. Back in July 1969, I was a teenager of 16 yrs old. I was lying in bed semi-asleep, when a high-pitched sound started. This sound was like a pure sinewave tone, I would estimate around 10Khz to 15Khz. I thought it was the cheap table fan on the small table by the window - it was a hot night. So I went to shut it off, thinking the motor maybe needed oiling, and I'd do that the next day. My parents and sisters were alseep in their rooms, and I didn't want to wake them by going down the squeaky stairs to the basement for oil. When I shut the fan off, the noise continued, and seemed to come from outside. I walked over to the window, which was open, and looked out. What I saw was utterly amazing to me! Hovering motionless over Mr Allen's roof which was about 150 feet away, was this globe-like thing. It was about 5 or 6 feet in diameter, perfectly round, and was a dark greyish semi-shiney color. It just hovered there, not moving, and I kept hearing that whistle/tone that I mentioned before. There were no lights on it. I went to my parents bedroom and woke my mom up, but she complained that I was goning to wake my dad up - I told her to come to my room, she refused and told me to go back to bed and shut up. So I went back to my bedroom, and sat by the window, watching that thing, amazed by it. After about 20 minutes, it literally flew straight up in the air and disappeared, and instantly that sound stopped, like turning off a switch. The speed of this thing was almost instant, like 500 miles an hour I would guess. It just vanished! I weant back to bed, lay there and eventaully drifted off to sleep. But I'll never forget what I saw, and I know it wasn't a dream, because the next day mom confronted me about waking her up the night before. I've talked about this to others, and the usual response was typical - thay I was making this story up. But I know better. I'm not dumb. Thanks again for allowing me to share this.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

Low flying craft that defies explanation.;1980-06-23 20:00:00;1 minute;Low flying craft that defies explanation. As I drove down Chalfont Drive I noticed a silver object moving at a slow, steady pace.  It was 8 pm but still quite light out as this was in summer.  It was heading north and I decided to follow it.  As I made a left onto Waldermire Drive I followed the craft as far as I could.  The object was round and metallic (I could see sun light reflection).  As I made this turn I caught a quick glimpse of the rear view of the object.  It had two half circles with a rod connecting these two half circles.  So in other words this object had two half round sides with something connecting them in between.  The side view showed a round metallic shere.  The rear showed two half spheres.  As I made the left turn onto Wlademire Drive there were a man and woman at their parked car and she was pointing at this object.  I kept driving to follow it.  I did eventually lose sight of it as there was no way to follow because of the direction it was traveling and the road did not go that way.  It was flying low.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
I sighted in daylight between 1 and 8 small, bright, round objects high in the sky over a period of 7 hours that flew from north to eas;1997-08-17 09:30:00;7 hours;Summary : I sighted in daylight between 1 and 8 small, bright, round objects high in the sky over a period of 7 hours that flew from north to east in usually in three's in various patterns(triangular, stacked, linear). I first spotted these bright, white round or oblong objects (they resembled a bright star)at 9:30 am on Sunday August, 17, 1997  in the morning. I noticed one such oject  flying from west to east  above and behind a blimp which was traveling slowly in the opposite direction. I viewed this through a a glass door overlooking downtown Philadelphia, PA from my fifth floor apartment building. The sky was clear blue. I opened the door onto an outside porch to view the flying bright object unobstructed. There were two other objects on the right flying east. They were not flying terribly fast, but they appeared to be flying in a triangular formation. I sighted such objects from 9:30 am until 4 pm. They would continue for the most part to appear from the north and fly east. There would be anywhere from one object to eight objects in the sky at once, moving in and out of various flight patterns (triangular, stacked, linear). They usually flew in three's in a triangular formation. Somethimes two would fly very close together, and then move apart. Sometimes two would fly as a double on top of one another or next to one another. At 1:30 pm I saw as many an eight objects in the sky at once. I was walking to the market a few blocks from my apartment building. When I reached the store I could see above the store  moving from north to east approx. seven or eight bright round objects. They resembled a bright star, like venus. There was, however, at this time one object that appreared brighter than the rest and its upper portion flashed or blinked. Next to it appeared an object that was smaller and appeared a dull red. That object moved east and disappeared. Three of the other objects moved north and four others moved east. By the time I returned home, I could see two objects stacked on top of one another flying east. These objects were small. It is hard to guess at what altitude they were flying. I would say at least 30,000 feet. Objects would appear out of the north and fly east until about 4:00 pm. At least one or two was always present in the sky. Then they tapered off and by 4-4:30 pm, there were no objects sighted.  My roommate saw the objects as well and was baffled. It was very strange since it lasted such a long period of time. I called one of the local news stations around 2 pm, but nothing was reported on the evening news. The objects were not very large, the size of a star, like venus. They were very bright, white in color. They moved with a strange fluidity. That is what caught my attention initially. They would move together and apart quite rapidly and in and out of various formations.There is an airport that is nearby and many planes could be seen while the objects were visible. But the objects and a plane cou! ld not be confused because of the objects movement. They moved with an agility that I have never seen a plan demonstrate. I am a native of the Philadelphia area for the past 30 years and am very used to seeing planes. These objects were different. They were not random lights because they seemed to moved in very purposeful, logical  formations and repeated these patterns often. Their speed was much  faster than your average commercial plane, but they did not streak across the sky or anything like that.  Sometimes the formations(triangles, lines, stacked) spanned many miles, sometimes they were closed in. Usually they would expand and contract the formation or move out of the formation into another one. There is an Air Force Base in New Jersey, McGuire Air Force Base, perhaps 50 miles away. But these objects did not resemble any miliary aircraft that I every saw.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451

Pearl shaped ufo leaving smoke trail in photograph in downtown philly.;2013-04-06 16:00:00;short;pearl shaped ufo leaving smoke trail in photograph in downtown philly A pearl shaped ufo leaving a smoke trail was discovered on a photograph i took in downtown Philadelphia.  I took random photographs that day and one was a photograph of a street sign ?mole Street against the clear blue sky.   At that time i didn't notice anything in the sky and really wasn't focused on that.  Only later did i see a white streak and zoomed in to see what it was.  I was very surprised that it showed this round white object with a a smoke trail behind it.   I computerized the image to see if it would resolve into an airplane and a contrail.  No matter what i did the round shape persisted.  i used some of the tools available to bring it in closer and in a sharper contrast. It is not an airplane,or birds, or a balloon, and is too round to be a meteor.  It is not flaw in the camera or lense.  I've never seen a ufo but apparently i took a picture of one completely by accident.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Blue white illuminated sphere with smaller spheres orbiting object;2013-10-20 19:00:00;1 hour;Blue white illuminated sphere with smaller spheres orbiting object I am sending this report in response to a recent sighting in Pennsylvania.  The report stated that the object looked like a star with another light going around it, the report is from Chester, PA, on 2/15/2014. This seems very similar to an object I have seen off and on over Philadelphia for many years.  I have shown this to others and have looked at it through binoculars, the object seems very stationary and does not move out of view from the sight of the binoculars as planets and other objects do. I would describe it as a bright  blue white object with lights spinning around it.  The smaller lights I would say are ¼ the size of the central object and can be red, blue and yellow and spin rather quickly around the center object in multiple directions.  The object also can seem larger or smaller and appear in different parts of the sky.  The object does not seem to move as a planet does or any other object I have ever looked at in the sky.  We have many helicopters and planes over Philadelphia and the object does not move the same way as them either.  The object I would say is very still and at times moves but not when I am looking at it. I have an interest in sky watching and have tracked planets across the sky and they move fairly quick past your view in a telescope or binoculars this object does not have any of those characteristics.  I have been seeing this since the late 80's and have seen it last year at times.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Small orange orb flew from ground and over head.;2014-07-05 21:30:00;5 minutes;small orange orb flew from ground and over head Small orange illuminated ufo took flew vertically from the ground at a distance of about 200 yards.    Once it reached a height of about 164 meters, it stopped rising and began flying horizantally.   The ufo took a flight path almost directly over top of us.   It proceeded until it left our line of sight.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
Star-like object stationary for 2 hrs, then takes off at high rate of speed.;2015-07-30 01:30:00;2 1/2 hrs;Star-like object stationary for 2 hrs, then takes off at high rate of speed My daughter, her husband, and I were sitting on her front step, at approx. 0130 on July 30, 2015.  We happened to notice a strange looking star-like object, maybe 45 degrees from the horizon.  We were looking north.  It was faintly flashing blue and red lights.	    After observing it for a while, we started to notice tiny little lights going to and from it.  We got out the telescope, but having never used it before, it took us a while to find the object.  When we did, it appeared to be just a round white sphere.  We didn’t see any little lights with the telescope. The object didn’t move for approx. 2-2 ½  hrs.  As we were looking at the object, it took off at an extremely high rate of speed in an easterly direction.  There is a tree across the street, and I tried to run down the sidewalk to see where it was going, but by the time I got to other side of the tree, it was gone. Might I add that I was not a believer until I witnessed that.  I know that whatever I saw, was not from this world.  Even if I hadn’t seen it move, it might be different, but I saw it go from a complete standstill, to moving like nothing I’ve ever seen mover through the sky.;39.9908941640383;-75.1497700315451
