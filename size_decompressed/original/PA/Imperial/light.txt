2 lights circling/chasing each other;2014-02-01 20:30:00;1 hour;2 lights circling/chasing each other Two hazy white lights were seen circling/chasing each other tonight by myself and my husband and three children.   The speed and paths of the lights varied.  Sometimes the lights came close together, sometimes it appeared as if they were chasing each other.    No sound was heard.  No beam of light was seen, like you would expect to see from a spot light or a search light.  The lights would temporarily disappear behind the clouds, making it seem as if the source of lights were from above the clouds.   After we had watched the lights for over an hour, the lights gradually started to move slower and became dimmer, to the point we could no longer see them.   I tried taking a video or picture, but the street lights were too bright and the mystery lights weren't visible in the videos and pictures.;40.4597;-80.2692
