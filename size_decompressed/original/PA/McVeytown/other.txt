daylight sighting,no wind, crescent-shaped object;2003-02-12 10:30:00;30-45 seconds;daylight sighting,no wind, crescent-shaped object My daughter had a snow day off from school, and I was outside shoveling while she played in the snow. At the time, the sky was clear with only a few clouds. There was little or no wind. She was laying down, making a snow angel, when she suddenly yelled excitedly for me to come over. I ran over as she pointed to the sky. I looked up, as she craned he necked backward to look behind her. I saw nothing. She described seeing something shaped like a slice of watermelon move in a straight line from west to east (I determined this from her position in relation to the front of the house). She said it was wobbling funny. When pressed, I asked what color it was, and she said it wasn't green and red like watermelon, but gray with black holes along the bottom edge. I later had her draw a picture and she depicted a crescent-shaped object with porthole-like objects along the bottom. She also remembers a reddish glow around the object that then changed to either green or blue. This was a daylight sighting with little or no wind, and my daughter said it was not as high as a jet but way higher than a bird up in the sky. She also admitted that she watched it for quite a few seconds in stunned silence before she was able to open her mouth and call for me.
