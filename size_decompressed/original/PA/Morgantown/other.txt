Very strange happenings.;2016-05-19 02:30:00;~30 seconds;Very strange happenings. My girlfriend told me tonight that last night she woke up out of a sound sleep disorientated with a loud screeching sound in the room.  The room was flooded with light and her computer printer started printing.  Her cell phone clock was ok but the other clock in the room was wrong.   She left the room and went down 2 flights to the ground floor kitchen.  The clocks were all wrong.  When she calmed down, she went up stairs back to her room.  The clock was now correct and everything seemed back to normal. She didn't know what to think and later that day she told her son about it.  He and his wife's room were on the second floor and hers was on the third.  He hadn't mentioned it to her until she brought it up.  He and his wife went through the same thing in their room with the room flooded in light and the loud screechy noise.  In both cases, no room lights were turned on, no stereo etc...however in her room, the printer is always left on.  It started printing for no apparent reason. Although neither reported seeing an object, this sounded a little too much like some sort of encounter.;40.1571;-75.8918
