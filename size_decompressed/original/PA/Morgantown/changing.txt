No color, but it did change formation somewhat. In Southern Sky: Looked like exhaust, leaving a trail, from jet moving up but it was a curved line (and nighttime - with no clouds).  The light stopped and the trail started to fade.  Approx. 5-10 mins later, I looked up and the base of the tail (where it began) began to enlarge, brighten and take on a spherical shape as the entire length of trail became brighter (no color-just white).  It looked like there was a rip in the sky that had opened up. Sphere changed into oval/eye shape just the outline was white, the middle looked just like the rest of the sky. The trail (or tail as it now appears to have been) stayed attached and remained stationary as the base grew in size, in an easterly direction, as it faded.  I hope I don't offend, but it looked like a giant sperm in the sky.  By 00:35 it had dissappeared completely though I did not watch it the whole time b/c I came inside to get on-line. 1) Did not see an object that left the trail, just the trail itself 2) It did not have any color at all except maybe pale yellow 3) during the first stage of this sighting, when we just saw a trail moving in an upwards direction, there was an aircraft flying in a West-to-East direction (probably landing in Philadelphia);40.1571;-75.8918
