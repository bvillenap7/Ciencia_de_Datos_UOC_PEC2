While traveling south on route 202, I saw approximately 20 bright, orange, circular lights traveling north east in a group.  They flew in a slow, quiet group with no specific formation.   A few stragglers came up behind the group and I was able to capture a photo on my phone of one of the stragglers.  They eventually seemed to disappear.   They looked very bright orange with a bright yellow/white center. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));40.3556;-74.9839
Shining circle with rings.  ((NUFORC Note:  We have yet to see the photos.  Possible lens flares??  PD));2017-09-24 10:03:00;10 seconds;shinning circle with rings Driving on the bridge in New Hope, Pa., decided to take a picture of the water.  Once I got home I looked through all the pictures I took that day and noticed the one with the water , at the top left corner was a shining circle and seemed like a cloud on it.  My phone is an iPhone 7 so when you take a picture you get about 5 seconds of video.  I zoomed in and held the screen down and it was moving around with rings around the circle.  This was at 10:03 am. ((NUFORC Note:  We have yet to see the photos.  Possible lens flares??  PD));40.3556;-74.9839
