About 5:00 this morning I went outside and noticed what looked to be a bright star in the northeast.  Immediately, two fiery tails - It almost looked like a triangle of light. I thought it might be a falling star but it wasn't moving.  OR a plane waiting to land at the PHL airport.   A flash of red lights along the bottom now and then.  It seemed to be turning in place.  Once it was broadside, I could see a shape - cigar or disk...  I brought out binoculars and could see it more clearly. It may have been a blimp (?)  But it wasn't moving.  If not full, then very bright moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));40.3556;-74.9839
