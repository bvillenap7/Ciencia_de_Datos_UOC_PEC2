immobile gray sphere, far off, but appeared rather large in size;2007-01-02 14:00:00;10 seconds;immobile gray sphere, far off, but appeared rather large in size Was drving down the road and noticed the object far off over some trees, too far away to see any detail, other than it wasn't an aircraft.  Was perfectly round, gray/silver in color and rather far off.  Did not have lights, but had reflected glare.  Did not see it moving, but my driving caused it to leave my range of sight.  Looked for it again but saw nothing.;40.9476;-79.7377
