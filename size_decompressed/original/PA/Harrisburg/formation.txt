Light formations over Harrisburg, PA on 4/1/96.;1996-04-01 22:00:00;1hr;Light formations over Harrisburg, PA on 4/1/96. My roommate and I were returning from the Mall in Harrisburg.  The mall was ready to close so the time was about 10pm when we were driving back to our apartment which was located off of progress avenue on the hill above Widener University school of law.  I was riding in the passenger seat and notices a round, yellowish light in the sky.  Then what seemed a few feet to the right of that light another light turned on.  Then another and another.  Ultimately, there were six lights in the sky that looked like this:    O   O   O   O   O   O.  I told my roomate to pull the car over.  When he did the lights were gone.  I got out of the car and noticed a very small red dot in the sky.  It was a light.  It was moving very, very fast from right to left, then up and down and all over the place.  Then it would stop.  Once it was stopped, a few seconds later the light formation would start again like I described above.  We drove around the backroads there for about an hour following it.  What scared my the most about this UFO was that someone apparently saw on 9/18/02 (posted on this site on 3/21/03).  The strangest part is when we got very close to the lights.  Right by this old farm house that has a big pond on the side of their home.  I was very familiar with this road becuase it was a very beautiful place to walk/run as I would often jog on that road for exercise.  We pulled over into the driveway of the farm house.  We pulled over because there was anohter man who had seen the light and pulled over also. We got out of the car.  At that time there was only one light and it was floating toward us.  It came over a bunch of pine trees and across a field directly toward me and my roomate.  He got scared as it got to about 40 yards from us.  He begged for me to get in the car but I couldn't move.  I wasn't scared.  I was amazed.  He got back into his car.  The light came toward me and the stranger that had pulled over.  It was getting closer and closer.  It was a large, warm glowing light.  It was beautiful.  I felt no danger.  It's weird to say this but I felt very safe, almost like I was being comforted a bit somehow.  It sounds stupid but it's true.  Well, as the light got closer, now it was about 20 yards away, a car came down the road from our right and the way the road bends the cars headlights blinded me and the stranger.  When the car passed us the light was gone and that's how the entire incident ended.  The stranger jumped in his car and took off.  My roomate was yelling at me at that point to get in the car.  We went back to our apartment and called all our frineds.  They didn't believe us becasue it was April fools day.  I called 911 and told them what I saw. Well, the next day in class I drew a picture of the formation of lights for one of my frineds.  One month later that friend called me and told me to turn on the tv.  In May of 1996 there was a similar sighting in Arizona and it was on videotape.  My friend was freaked out becuase of my drawing and how much it looked like the UFO over Arizona.   We wereI was apparently not the only person in Harrisburg to see that UFO that night as it made the local news.  They discounted it as a flare from an f-16 which is used as a decoy from heat seaking missles.  I found it interesting when the Arizona UFO was discounted they same way, saying it was a flare.  If the government has a flare that can float and hover and light up for over an hour then fine.  That's what I saw.  However, the flare that they showed on the news that the f-16's drop fall to the ground like a brick.  That's not what we saw.  I'd love to talk to the girls that saw the similar UFO on 9/18/02.  I think we saw the same thing.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
Formation of lights observed over Three mile Island area. Exactly the same formation and sequencing of lights as seen in Pheonix about ;1997-04-15 22:30:00;20 min;Formation of lights observed over Three mile Island area. Exactly the same formation and sequencing of lights as seen in Pheonix about the same time The Tuesday before easter in 1997 my wife and anothe couple saw about 8 lights sequsncing on and off above three mile island. We witnessed this in  York, Pa about 20 miles away. The lights were extremely bright and one would go off at the end of the rqw only to be replaced by one turning on at the begining of the row. The light seemed to hopscotch on and off. The lights also all went off and reappeared about 10 miles east of the original sighting. York County Controll was notified and the local police did respond (with much ridicule). This year I saw a show about the Lights over Phoenix about the same time and these were the same lights as I saw, Im certain;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
A Line of Lights in The North Sky- In the Area of Paxtonia/Lingelstown and By Costco Got Cell Phone Video!;2005-12-13 19:00:00;15 minutes;A Line of Lights in The North Sky- In the Area of Paxtonia/Lingelstown and By Costco Got Cell Phone Video! I saw the other post from 12/13/05 19:00 hours, so I decided to post.  I saw the same thing at around the same time.  We were on Interstate 81 heading North and right as we were getting off at the Paxtonia/Lingelstown Exit I slowed down on the ramp as I saw 4 yellowish circular lights in a long stretched out row very low in the sky directly in front of us.  My first thought was Man that plane is low! I slowed along the ramp and rolled down the window, my fiance was observing as well.  We did not see any plane body and there was no sound either, and then just like that it fizzled away.  Now, I never bought into anything with UFO's so natually I was trying to come up with a justification and could not.  I was thinking maybe fireworks, but there was no way it could have been and there was no noise either.  I wanted to see them again and kept looking, but saw nothing.  We got to Costco in Lower Paxton Twp at around 19:00, I looked up over the shopping center in the northern direction and sure eough the formation was back again.  The lights lit up in a row again and then fizzled out just as they had before.  I decided to get my cell phone out and take video of it, when it came up a third time I got it on my phone!!!!.... Unfortunatly because of the lights in the parking lot and the distance you cant see the distinct circles, but you can very clearly see a bright bursting line of light blended together, having a quick burst of orange and then slowly fading away (on the left center of the video screen). I waited to try and get another clip but did not see it for five minutes so I gave up.  As we walked into Costco it showed up one more time in the distance to the right of where we last saw it.  We saw it appear and disappear a total of 5 times.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
4 stationary lights shift position, move and disappear.;2006-12-07 18:00:00;30 seconds;4 stationary lights shift position, move and disappear. As I was driving down a road, I looked up and saw 4 little white lights in a horizontal row, stationary, slightly slanted up to the right.  As I watched, they shifted almost to a vertical line, slanting greatly down to the left.  Then the moved together to the left about an inch in two seconds and dissappeared.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
Harrisburg, PA - 7 to 8 light formation in the sky shaped like a boomerang - appeared 7 times;2007-12-12 17:25:00;10 minutes;Harrisburg, PA - 7 to 8 light formation in the sky shaped like a boomerang - appeared 7 times Driving east on 76 turnpike over the Susquehanna river @ 5:20 PM on 12/12/2007, saw a 7 to 8 light formation in the sky shaped like a boomerang, appeared for about 3 seconds, individual lights went out in order from top to bottom sequentially within 1 to 2 seconds.  This formation appeared again, about 5 to 10 miles east within about 30 seconds, then again way toward the west in about 30 seconds, then far in the distance about 10 miles in the opposite direction...this basically repeated 7 times before I had to move on.  Tried to catch this on my cell phone, but the light wasn't bright enough.  The weird thing is, 2 other people who I go to class with saw this at the same time I did about 10 mile north of where I was at the time.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
Cluster of 5 lights surrounding a center light with two red lights darting between the others;2008-10-20 05:00:00;10 minutes;Cluster of 5 lights surrounding a center light with two red lights darting between the others At 5 am this morning I saw a cluster of star like lights in the sky.  I thought it was an aircraft.  However it barely moved.  Then it changed position and I could clearly see 8 star like lights in a cluster.  Six were white and two were red and darting between the center light and the other 5 surrounding the one in the center.  It lasted ten minutes.  When I went to get my wife to see it, it disappeared.  At the same time time many meteors were falling.  A co worker just told me she saw the same thing at 5 in the morning 8 months ago.  She also saw meteors falling at the same time.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
