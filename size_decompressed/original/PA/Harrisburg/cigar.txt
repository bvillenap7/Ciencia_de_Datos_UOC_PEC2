Walked one block to drugstore and was looking up at a perfect cloudless blue sky (the first clear day in a week ) Very warm for February. I was looking up at the sky when I noticed ( there were gusty winds but no clouds at all,just very blue sky and sunny ) a glimmer from the North heading South.There was nothing else in the sky but this object.I saw distinctly a very shiny silvery cigar shaped object that had a pulsating Sphere/light as a companion. This Blue orb zig-zagged behind it and to it's sides but never went in front of it.I quick checked around to see if anyone else was watching but no one was and there was a fair amount of people around.I wanted to yell to people but I didn't.It was cruising high up.the orb turned green then back to blue.The craft never veered off the line it was following at a real slow pace.I was transfixed.I stared at this for 23 minutes and no one asked me what I was looking at.I watched until it vanished out of sight into nothingness. It wasn't a figment of my imagination,Sun-spots,reflections,a kite,a plane,a blimp,a promotional stunt,or swamp gas.no vapor trail or wings. This I swear to be true. I wrote all this down just after it happened and then just stumbled onto this site and thought I will report this anyway.

Capsule shaped object seen.;2020-10-06 17:00:00;5 seconds;Capsule shaped object seen. I was outside looking up (honestly not sure why). I saw a white cigar/long capsule shaped object moving at between 5,000 to 15,000 mph (guessing based on speed and altitude). The object was traveling southwest to the northeast. There were no noticeable jet plumes. I immediately yelled for my wife and as soon as she arrived the object was gone. It was traveling aerodynamically. My family is tired of me talking about my experience.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
