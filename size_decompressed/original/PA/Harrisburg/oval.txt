Pink aura flying below cloud cover.;2008-01-03 22:45:00;10 minutes;Pink aura flying below cloud cover. On the night of the 3rd I was traveling home from Carlisle using I-81 east bound toward Harrisburg.  After I passed the New Kingston exit while still traveling east I spotted off to my North out of the corner of my eye what appeared to be a light pink aura moving below cloud level to the point that it refracted the color off the bottom of the cloud cover, to appear as if it was in the clouds.  It was traveling from North West in a South Eastern direction.  I was traveling 65mph and at this point, I followed it until it went over my car and then coming back into view through the front windshield of my car.  It couldâ€™ve been at least 1500 feet from the ground and the speed was that of a slow moving commuter flight.  I followed it as it moved out of my viewing distance as it was traveling south east and keeping my eye on it and the road was nearly impossible.  I can honestly say that I do not believe that it was a jet flight due to the fact that there were no FAA lights on it or giving the appearance of an aircraft of any sort.

UFO in Harrisburg;2011-03-02 17:15:00;5 Seconds;UFO in Harrisburg I have been seeing / reading lot of UFO stuff in the internet for quite some time now but I never thought I will experience it too. I saw a grey oval object as I was passing the Paxton Exit driving towards 322E.  First I observed 2 planes, 1 flying at very low altitude (probably took off from Harrisburg Airport) and the other one at around 1000 ft.  As the lower plane past I saw this grey oval object that turned into a bright light 3 times and disappeared. Can somebody tell me what I saw???
