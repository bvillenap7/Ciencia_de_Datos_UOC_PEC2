Flew around in sky then flew off in westerly direction.;1996-11-13 23:56:00;4 minutes;Summary : Flew around in sky then flew off in westerly direction. On the date specified above a small glowing light flew across the sky in a zig-zag pattern. This light was not blinking which eliminates the possibility of an airplane, nor did it fly in a straight line so it was not a satellite.  The light flew around for a few minutes then flew off in a westerly direction.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
Six lights appear above Harrisburg skyline;2005-02-15 20:45:00;5-10 seconds;Six lights appear above Harrisburg skyline There were six objects total.  At first I thought it was just a plane coming from behind a cloud because I saw one light appear, and then another.  Three lights appeared side by side and in order (slightly down and to the left), and then the first light disappeared and the fourth light appeared in order with the others.  Then all lights disappeared and two more showed up at the same time slightly lower on the horizon.  The colour of the light was like an orange street light colour.  They were seen above the tops of the buildings in the Harrisburg skyline from the South Bridge (Interstate 581/83).;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
Lights in the sky and a shiny object that went behind a cloud, cloud disappeards after a while;2006-12-30 18:30:00;About a minute?;((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  We would like to have the witness re-submit his report, using one report form per sighting.  PD)) Lights in the sky and a shiny object that went behind a cloud, cloud disappeards after a while I work in CampHill, get back from work at various times of the day since I have flexible work hours. I drive from my office on Erford Road to N. Front St across the Harvey Taylor bridge. I've had 3 experiences that I found strange worth reporting, particularly after reading some of the reports from Harrisburg, PA.  1) About 2 weeks back from (12/29/2006), driving back from work around 7'ish in the evening, I had just entered Harvey Taylor bridge and I was looking at the sky in front towards the state capitol and I see a set of lights in the sky, bright white lights in the distance off to the right side of capitol. My first thought was that it must be lights up in the mountain and then realized the mountains are to my left and I was still wondering what the light was, continuing to drive looking at the road and the sky, by the time I was getting towards the Front St. intersection I could see the lights were turning right to left and just disappeared. By the time I got to the intersection and had a red I was thinking it must have been a plane since there's an airport close by, but I've never seen that many lights and they were very bright and gave the appearance it was in far off and it disappeared, since I have to use 2nd st to get to my apartment on Front St and there are buildings on 2nd I couldn't see anything more. When I parked my car at the apartment I scanned the sky in the direction in which I had seen the lights hoping to see something but there was nothing, and I thought nothing of it.  2) Today (12/30/2006)I was coming back from my weekly gorcery at Giants (Camp Hill), I was driving back on Harvey Taylor bridge, I had just entered the bridge and again a set of lights this time towards the left side of capitol and a lot closer than what I saw last time. I could count about 6 distinct bright white lights, I couldn't make out any shape as I continued driving I'm looking at the sky and the road ahead, it's impossible to stop on Harvey Taylor without getting yourselves killed because a lot of people speed, I had covered about 3/4th of the bridge and the ligths as far as I could make out were stationary and then the lights just disappeared. I kept scanning the sky for anything a plane, anything that could explain the lights as I was driving on 2nd and again when I got to my apartment and parked.  I usually see planes in the evening sky from probably the airport close by but they are identifiable becuase you see them, there are the lights which are not unusually bright and you can see them move steadily and then you hear them and if you keep looking you can see them go away from you.  I have lived in this area for close to 4 years now, I think I have a fairly good idea of the Harrisburg skyline, I usually bike or walk and many I've taken my bike across the brige to look at the skyline from the other side of the river. I think I can say those lights were not from any building, even though the lights I saw was low in the sky.  I'm not an expert and I have nothing to gain from this, just found it a little strange and I thought I should report. Coming to the third experience, I have not too much to report. I live in a high rise apartment on the front st, overlooking the river with my apartment windows giving a beautiful view of the mountains in the distance. Some time in the past 2 weeks (it was a weekend because I was home) probably around 2-3 PM, I was going in to the kitchen to make some coffee. There's a small window in the kitchen facing the mountain, I just instinctively looked outside, and saw a small patch of wispy clouds in the sky over the mountains, probably what made me stop and continue looking at the clouds was a shining disc like object just at the edge of the clouds. I kept staring, thinking that I should go to my living room window because it gives a better view but I couldn't move and kept staring and I saw the object disappear behind the clouds. I went in to my bed room pulled out my binoculars (I've got a 15*70 Porro Prism Celestron) from the shelf and to look the clouds hoping the object would reappear. The clouds was not too much and the sky was really clear and blue, just a little and wispy, but I could see nothing but the clouds. So I put my binocular down, pulled my chair to the window and just sat there staring at the clouds, the strange thing was the clouds disappeared totally, usually you see the clouds moving with an air current but this just disappeared and the sky was totally clear. I sat there in my chair looking out the window and after a while I just went back to my routine life.  I am an amateur astronomer and I look at the sky with my naked eye and at times with my binoculars (harrisburg city is not the best place to look at night sky). I have no idea about what I saw, just that it was not normal that I'm used to.  I am an engineer and I work in a field where my main skills are problem solving, I would rate myself as a person with a scientific outlook.  I did not bother to look at the exact time and I did not even bother to note down the date, becuase I still hope that there is a simple explanation and maybe what I was just something very ordinary and easily explained, probably it was just that I found it strange. What brought me to this site was to try and see if there was anyone reporting anything like this in Harrisburg and google search brought me here, I thought for a long time before I decided to post what I saw.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
3 large very bright lights in a line formation above I81 in harrisburg;2007-12-12 17:00:00;3 to 4 seconds;3 large very bright lights in a line formation above I81 in harrisburg My wife and I were driving on I81 north by progess ave. exit at about 5:30pm and noticed 3 lights in the sky in a strait formation very large. The lights all came on very bright red and then all faded out at the same time.  It seemed to me that all the traffic was at a halt looking at the same thing we were looking at. The length was easy the size of a football field or longer. Im sure this will not be the only report of this sighting. I know hundreds of people saw the same thing.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
White light seen moving off in the distance at dusk;2011-11-06 18:35:00;5 seconds;White light seen moving off in the distance at dusk This is what may have been the 2nd time I have seen this object.  I reported it quite some time ago when it was viewed outside my home.   This time it was off in the distance maybe 10 miles away. It was climbing at a shallow angle and moving to the northeast. This is similar to the path it took the first time I saw it.  The area it was over would be the Blue Mountain just north and west of Harrisburg.   The speed of the object was faster than regular aircraft and it was moving away from my location.   So this would place me behind and some what to the side of the object.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
Eight lights lit up the night sky and dissapeared after ten seconds.;2014-09-09 21:32:00;10 seconds;Eight lights lit up the night sky and disappeared after ten seconds. 	I live in Linglestown, Pennsylvania, and was watching television on the couch at approximately 9:32 p.m. (eastern time) on September 9th, 2014, when something caught my eye from the window.  I stood up and looked out, and saw about eight yellowish-white dots in the sky.  I then called my mother over to see them and by the time she got to the window, about half of them faded away.  About three seconds later, they were all gone.   Obviously I didn't know what they were, so I examined their placement in the night sky.  They were too high up to be anything like fireworks or spotlights and there were too many of them to be airplanes or shooting stars.  I had no clue what they could have been. 	After the initial shock of seeing what I thought was a UFO, I went outside to see if I could find the dots again.  It took me about three minutes of staring at the sky to realize that nothing would be coming back.   I then proceeded to go inside and get on the computer to research my finding.  I looked and looked and came up with nothing.  My mother then informed me that she had read about UFO sightings on PennLive (our local internet news source) recently.  Hearing this, I knew that I had to tell a professional about my finding, so I found your webpage.   Please help me to figure out what this was that I had just saw.

Stationary light that took off abruptly all of a sudden sudden;2018-10-07 21:00:00;5 minutes;Stationary light that took off abruptly all of a sudden sudden My grandmother and two of her friends were almost home and stopped at a stop sign when she asked the other two women if they saw that strange light in the sky above them that had been stationary for quite some time.   Her one friend said she had been watching it as, well, and was wondering what it was, when all of a sudden they said it took off rather quickly and they lost sight of it.  A third woman in the car told them it was just a helicopter.  My grandmother who is not one to believe in the unexplained told me she is positive that the light was not a helicopter.  She said it looked nothing like that and there was no noise from the craft when it took off.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
