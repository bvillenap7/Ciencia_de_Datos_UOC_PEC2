3 lights in the sky which stayed lit for 2/3 seconds in one pattern, disappeared and reappeared in different patterns...;2002-09-06 19:00:00;approx. 3 mins;3 lights in the sky which stayed lit for 2/3 seconds in one pattern, disappeared and reappeared in different patterns... can't precisely recall the color, but there were 3 lights that were lit for about 2 seconds (triangular formation) then they disappeared, reappeared in a different formation (straight up and down) for about 2 seconds... disappeared...  this happened about 3 times until we were cut off by trees (we were driving) also, my Mother who was approximately 3-5 miles away at this time, also witnessed these lights... when she first witnessed it, she said they were in a line straight across and she said they looked like 3 headlights in the sky... At first I thought it was a plane that was coming down because the lights were fairly bright, brighter than anything else in the sky, but then they disappeared and reappeared in a different formation, so I knew it wasn't a crashing plane...  it seemed close, yet somewhat far away, and it was eerie. We attempted to turn around and spot the lights again, but we couldn't find them again... as I said, my first assumption was that this was plane of some sort, but after that idea was debunked, I thought they seemed like fireworks or something, but there was no noise, and they were unlike any fireworks I've ever seen, plus they seemed too steady when they were lit. This is something that neither me, my girlfriend or my Mom had ever witnessed before.  We live on a suburban/rural boarderline, and as me and my Mom are open minded about most things, my girlfriend is a bit skeptical, yet she was the one to point out the lights to me, so... go figure...;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
