There were a series of yellow and red light formations on the horizon of the night sky.;2002-09-18 21:00:00;45 min.;There were a series of yellow and red light formations on the horizon of the night sky. Last Wednesday, the 18th of September, my sister came to my apartment around 8:45 or so in the evening.  I live on a fairly high floor of an apartment building, facing the city of Harrisburg.  I was eating dinner and looking out my bedroom window, while also talking to my sister.  A bright yellow (almost planet-looking) light appeared in front of my eyes as I glanced out the window, and then just as suddenly, disappeared. I was curious as to what happened, and told my sister to check out the sky.  We both stepped closer to the window, and on the horizon, we both saw the same type of light appear a few inches away from the one I saw initially.  There were three other lights that did essentially the same thing (blink in, stay in plain sight for approx. 5-10 sec., and then dissappear).  About 15 min or so into seeing the yellow lights, a red light appeared to the lower right of the yellow ones.  It then proceeded to split into a triangle of three identical red lights, and then all simultaneously disappear.  The red formation occurred a few times.  During the second red light formation, i called a friend who lives about two miles further down Front St. in Harrisburg, and has access to the second floor.  He was able to see a red light, from his vandtage point, at the same time I was seeing it.  While the red and yellow lights were blinking in and out, there was a white light, that streaked from right to diagonal lower left (approx. 2 inches in length).  The streak occurred in a split sec. and was the only one we witnessed.  While all of these fairly steady, planet-looking lights were appearing, and then disappearing (not streaking, or fading, or even twinkling), there were much smaller (star-like) lights which were zig-zagging across the entire visible expanse of sky.  Initially, they looked like very distant airplanes, until they started erratically bouncing up and down, back and forth, and any which way.  My sister witness these bouncing stars as well. I have a steady job, friends, and family, all of whom will concede that i'm pretty down to earth.  (i've kept two cats alive for at least a few years).  I do have a fairly liberal view of the world in general, and tend to accept a lot, but not without some proof.  I can hardly believe what I saw, but I've witnessed almost as strange instances in the past.  The friend who I called on the evening of the 18th was the one who checked out this web site, and I felt compelled to send in this info. since other sightings in PA had been reported.  There was apparently a news report this past Sunday (the 22nd) stating that some sort of Airforce testing (flares in the sky so they could test heat-sensitive missiles) was occurring this month.  Whatever.  I 've seen flares in the sky.  They linger, and fade.  These lights DISAPPEARED!!!  I've also seen airplanes turn course in the night sky (they don't just disappear).  Whatever these lights were, I've never seen exactly what i saw on the night of the 18th.  I hope there are those out there who will take credence in (at least) three witnesses of a single event over a bull story from our fabulous government. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from Pennsylvania for this date.  We wonder whether the lights might have been advertising lights, but the witness insisted that such was not the case.  We spoke with this witness and found her to be lucid, serious-minded, and credible.  We may have erred in suggesting to her that the event might have been caused by advertising lights, which are reported to NUFORC on a frequent basis.  PD));40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503

I looked up and thought I was witnessing a very low plane headed right for the end store and the parking lot but there was no noise and I did not feel any panic or fear.  There were three lights almost in a row but slightly diagonal from left to right (raised higher on the right).  Two of the lights were closer together on the left and the one on the right was at the tip of the diagonal.  They were amber and white and very bright.  All three moved rapidly above the end store and then hovered there for a few seconds.  I was shocked when they suddenly went completely vertical but I could not keep from staring.  Then they rapidly split off in three directons and became pinpoints of light in a matter of seconds. They just disappeared!  I am an accountant and computer tech, female, married, and I am flipped out by this.  I live close to Indiantown Gap so I thought maybe the guys were on maneuvers but if we have anything that can move that fast, I would be happy to hear about it--this is too weird for me and I would like a logical explanation of what I saw.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
Five points of light in a V formation over Susquehanna River;2007-12-14 17:30:00;10 minutes;Five points of light in a V formation over Susquehanna River While traveling on #322 East towards Harrisburg I sighted  five points of light in a  V formation.  They blinked out and reappeared 3 times in the same formation.   This sighting was over the Susquehanna  River. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Stationary hovering three tiered object, a short row of red lights above and below a long row of white lights.;2017-02-22 21:09:00;15 awxibsa;Stationary hovering three tiered object, a short row of red lights above and below a long row of white lights. At approximately 9:09 pm EST, clear skies and visibility. I opened the door to my back deck in Harrisburg, PA, facing east.  As soon as I opened the door, in the sky was an object with red lights above, white lights in the middle, red lights below.  The white lighted middle section was longer then then the red sections above and below.  The sections above and below were equal in size. The object hovered stationary, slightly swaying right and left.  I watched for approximately 15 seconds before deciding to make a run for my iPhone.  Unfortunately upon returning, the object was gone.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503

One large craft stood still mostly but moved on occasion ascending and descending.  Large bright light.  Family member reported seeing the same about a mile away as well as one flickering on and off with red lights.  Definitely an ongoing thing seeing these craft at night.  Also there has been a military presence of helicopters in the area.  I mean as I type this, there are probably about 5 traveling at super low speed almost hovering just above the houses.  There must be dozens more in the distant sky.  They almost have a hangman shape to them.  Some seem to skip and flicker and others just hover or descend from higher in the sky.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
