Cylinder shape metal object right over head and in front of us on highway. Sparkled in sun reflection.  Tilted at about a 45 degree angle both poles of the object one pointed at sky other at the ground and was moving directly away from us opposite of the way it appeared to be pointed.  Was moving oddly fast when we first noticed it moving away from us overhead like following the highway and then it increased speed rapidly and shot off and disappeared in a second.  I followed it with my eyes or at least tried to it literally shot off and got tiny really fast showing distance and disappeared ahead in a smooth but sudden and lightning fast acceleration and was gone.  Clear blue open sky sunny out at the time we saw it.  Girlfriend and I both saw it.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
