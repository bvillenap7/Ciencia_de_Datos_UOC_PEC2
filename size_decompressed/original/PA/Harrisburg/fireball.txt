First it was white, then red and then green I am a long distance truck driver with a 4 year college degree. I was travelling south on I-83 out of Harrisburg towards my next destination when I observed, in the western sky, a fireball the size of a baseball held at arms length. It was first a bright white and then it changed to red and finally to green before it disappeared. I had to keep my eye on the road so I don't know if it disappeared over the horizon or faded out. This was witnessed by other truck drivers as they were all discussing it over the CB;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
Orange Glow in north west  Harrisburg, Pa Sky;2008-12-10 20:40:00;one minute;Orange Glow in north west  Harrisburg, Pa, Sky Two of us witnessed a bright orange glow in the north west sky at about 8:40pm.  It was intensely bright and then slowly dimmed until the regular night sky was visible.  The sky was cloudy and foggy so we did not have a clear view of the object causing this. This bright glow was stationary and did NOT move in any direction, nor did it fall to the ground. It lit up the sky like daylight for about one minute then slowly faded!   Did anyone else see this?  What was it, a meteor, a planet burning up?  What is the logical explanation?   It couldn't be the space shuttle, that landed two days before!;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
Several (15-25), bright, fiery looking objects moving in straight line across the sky.;2012-10-27 11:30:00;2 minutes;Several (15-25), bright, fiery looking objects moving in straight line across the sky. My son and I both witnessed multiple (15-25 total) bright objects in the sky, moving in mostly straight lines. These objects reminded my son and I of something called “flash paper”, in appearance. They kind of looked like flames, slowly moving across the sky. They did seem to flicker but remained relatively bright, until they disappeared in the sky, maybe in the clouds. It was pretty much completely calm outside and there was no noise at all, no planes, just silence. We had a clear view, we live on the side of a small mountain and we were on our deck, watching them in a clear expanse of sky. At the same time, we were able to see a nice bright ring around the moon, kind of in the partly cloudy sky I guess. It was very eerie in a sense and certainly, in my 44 years, have never seen anything like it.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
