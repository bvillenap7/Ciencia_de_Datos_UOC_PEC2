A strange objects flashing a color lights with an orangish fireball.;2005-11-07 23:30:00;1 hour +;A strange objects flashing a color lights with an orangish fireball. I was on my way to the gas station around 11:30 pm and then somehow I was looking up the sky and there was many stars but there was this one big noticable bright light that was keep on flashing with different types of color including purple, blue, yellow, and red.  At first I thought it was a plane or something, but it didn't move an inch and I was keep looking around and there was about 2 or 3 more of those similar looking lights from a distance. 30 mins later, I came back to my house and right before I walked into the house, I looked at the sky again, and there was that big bright object, and it was flashing all types of colors of light.  A few mins later, there was this orangish fireball shooting across real fast, it looked like a shooting star or whatever, but after seeing those weird objects flashing those colorful lights, I really can't say what that orange fireball was, but that fireball was very noticable, it caught right in my eyes, and I have never seen anything like that. I was always interested about UFOs but never believed it because I never saw one and today I think I did. I need some answers for this, and please let me know if other people have filled out a report form about Harrisburg UFO sighting on November 7th.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
