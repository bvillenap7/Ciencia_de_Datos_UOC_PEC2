Four vertical lights;2005-12-13 18:30:00;unsure;Four vertical lights I don't know if these were crafts or not.   My son and I were at the Giant Market on Linglestown Road.  In the N.E. sky we saw a warm yellow light.  It divided into two then three, then four lights of the same size lined up vertically.  Then they disappearred.  I then saw a flare just above the tree line and then very small individual points of light blinking on then off in different locations all over that area of sky.  This much of the event probably lasted for about five minutes.   We had seen something similar in the same area of the sky one week previously at approximately the same time when traveling on Linglestown Rd and Progress Avenue.  Fort Indiantown Gap is located in that region and there may be some experimentation going on there.   When I reviewed your listing of other sightings, I saw a siting posted on 5/24/05 of an event that occurred on 4/1/1996 in Harrisburg, PA in the same approximate area.  The sighting was very similar to ours.   If anyone else has seen anything there or may know what it is we saw, I would be very interested in hearing about it.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
possible UFO sighting;2010-10-10 02:30:00;4  minutes;possible UFO sighting As I got out of my car I happened to look up in the sky above the trees in my yard and saw what I thought was a helicopter but the object was not moving but hovering.   In the footage the object looks like he lights are flickering but without the camera it looked like the lights were rotating.   I was facing the east and the angle was about 60 degrees from the horizon.   Unfortunately I wasn't able to hold a steady hand while I recorded this but the object was still I was moving.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
Four reddish orange lights in the sky.;2011-07-04 22:52:00;3 minutes;Four reddish orange lights in the sky I was driving on rt 83 heading to work in steelton and observed one brightly lit object in the sky (reddish orange).   I got down the highway a little further past the tree line and saw that there were yet three more.  They were spread out in a diamond shape.   I pulled off the road to watch. They moved very slowly, couldn't tell if there was any sound.  I was near a highway, but it was nothing i have ever seen before.   So for about three minutes i watched, snapped a very grainy photo. Three of the lights are visible in the photo, the fourth was behind a hwy sign.  After the photo was taken a passanger plane was heading towards the four lights. Three of the four faded out one after another.  The fourth was very close when the plane passed (the pilots had to have been able to see the light, if not all of them).  After the plane passed the last lit light, the light dimmed a little then began to follow the plane (from my vantage point).   After that it dimmed out.  Almost like a candle flickering. (happened above TMI and HIA area)  Very Weird!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Large Bright Orb Appearing Periodically.;2013-11-14 20:00:00;1 hour;Large Bright Orb Appearing Periodically. A bright glowing ball appeared in the west/south-west sky at approximately forty degrees high in the sky. I have seen the same light several times.  It will remain for a few hours and disappear, only to return a week or so later.  It is the brightest light in the sky, and attempts to identify it with planetary/star charts have failed.;40.2905597315436;-76.8439073825503
