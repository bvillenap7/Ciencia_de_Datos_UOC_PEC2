Triangular craft over Poconos...;2011-04-21 22:00:00;3 MINUTES;Triangular craft over Poconos... Thursday, April 21, 2011   My son, his girlfriend and myself heard a loud noise about one half hour before the sighting but didnâ€™t go outside as my son was practicing a presentation he had for the next day.  We heard the noise again, only this time much louder.   My son ran outside and quickly yelled for us to come outside.  We ran outside only to see a triangular solid aircraft that had 3 lights on the outside of the craft.  It was a very large craft and very loud, as it shook my house as it flew by.  Within a few minutes, it was gone.   My son had seen this ship a few weeks earlier but we did not believe him.;40.9686;-75.4502
