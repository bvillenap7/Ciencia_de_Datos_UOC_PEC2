It was a very clear night full of stars.  After a few minutes, my wife pointed up to one of the stars and mentioned it was moving.  I followed looking up to the same place she pointed and lo and behold! It was in fact moving.  We both followed it and turned our bodies facing the direction it was going which was behind us.  We kept tracking it for about 20 seconds when it suddenly disappeared!  We were astonished because we had never seem this before and planes flying overhead at night are clearly visible by their lights and we can hear them.  We have no idea what we saw.  We tried to find an online resource that would explain and the closest explanation is a satellite.  However, we have no way of figuring out if and which it is from various sites.  The only tracking info available is for the ISS and its path is nowhere near us.  It is supposed to be orbiting over Brazil.;40.9686;-75.4502
