Two lights in the sky that were not planes or any other craft that flies at normal flying altitudes.;2012-10-23 20:00:00;2 minutes;Two lights in the sky that were not planes or any other craft that flies at normal flying altitudes. I was taking my dog outside, and looked up into the sky.  After a couple of seconds I noticed a far off light. It was too far in the sky to be a plane, and at first I thought it was maybe a satellite.  It was moving too fast though to be a satellite.  It was moving from West to East, and then abruptly changed coursed and made a 90 degree turn towards the North.  I lost sight of the object, and then saw another object that looked the same as the first, far away and moving at a similar speed.  The second object was moving in the same Northward direction as the first object was going when I last saw it.  I am sure the objects were not planes, and have never seen anything like it before.;40.8963;-77.4769
