Chevron shaped objects, multiple lights, heading northwest to southeast at high rate of speed.;2005-12-04 21:00:00;45 secs.;Chevron shaped objects, multiple lights, heading northwest to southeast at high rate of speed. Two chevron shaped objects were observed moving from the northwest to the southeast. First chevron object appeared at approx. 21:00 on 12/4/05. It appeared to be formed by approx. two dozen individual white lights of very low intensity (approx. same brightness as Polaris). Lights formed a luminous chevron shaped object. Speed appeared to be very great, much faster than high altitude commercial traffic. Second chevron appeared approx. 3 minutes later and followed the same path across the sky. It was smaller, consiting of approx. 12 individual lights. Both objects disappeared much in the way a satellite disappears from view after leaving the terminator area. I am an amateur observer and know the current sky positions of both Venus and Mars, this was not either of these planets.;40.1751;-74.8539
