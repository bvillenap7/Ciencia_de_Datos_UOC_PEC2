Flame flying across sky;2010-05-22 21:00:00;4 minutes;Flame flying across sky In an extremely busy business area, I made a left off of Business Rt. 1 to get to A1 Steakhouse.  I noticed a bright orange light in the sky moving from my left across the road I was on.  It was very low and at first I thought it was a helicopter circling towards the hospital.  But there was no blinking lights. Just a bright orange glow.  There was absolutely no sound from the object. Instead of making a left to where I wanted to go, I continued straight towards the light.  As I got closer I couldn't believe that it was like a flame with a glow around it, floating across the sky.  Flickering and moving straight across the sky at a steady speed. I quickly made a right into a parking lot so I could stop and watch it.  There was another car there with a guy standing with one leg still in his car, also watching it.  It was extremely windy that night, but the flame continued at a steady pace. It seemed to stop at one point and hover.  Then it began to move at a steep angl! e and disappeared into the clouds.  I sat there for several minutes stunned, trying to figure out what I had just seen.;40.1751;-74.8539
