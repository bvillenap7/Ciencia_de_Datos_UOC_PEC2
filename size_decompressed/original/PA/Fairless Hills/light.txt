Stars Pulsating and moving erraticly.;2006-11-11 23:50:00;00:59;Stars Pulsating and moving erraticly. 11:40 EST i was looking at the stars , very little cloud cover i could visibly see stars and what i believe was orion, and i saw what i thought was a star at the time that was pulsating and moving, it was way too far out for any reasonable description but i am certain it was moving.  Its movement was erratic. It would jump about an inch of the sky at a time and leave a slight trail as it went.  As well when it stopped moving it looked as though it snapped into place.  after second and thrid guessing myself i called for my mother to take a look. She as well saw it and its movement. The light eminating off of it was different than starlight,it had a blueish quality to it, the source of light looked to be rectangular but i cant tell for sure.  After staring at the one for some time i noticed another moving star with the same movement and blueish hue. theres not much more i can say about the objects other than they were there for a while.;40.1751;-74.8539
