My friend told me it was a planet but I refused to believe it and kept staring at it. It looked like it was moving and starting to form a sort of trail, I do not know if it was or was not moving though. As I was staring at another dot to the right of it, same description, but it was not as bright. Pretty soon there were six of these dots in the sky forming two triangles.  They were both an obtuse shape and both were the same exact shape.  They were not in any sort of formation though. The lights sat there for about 5 minutes.  We had stoppped at the Pep Boys on Lincoln highway and there were several people that had noticed the lights also and were also looking.  Nobody seemed frantic but everybody was very curious.  I have no background in any of this but I was told they were likely meteors.  I do not believe they were but that is the beauty of it.  I saw something that I can not explain.;40.1751;-74.8539
