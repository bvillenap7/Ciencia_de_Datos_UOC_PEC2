Bright Light;2012-07-25 03:56:00;10-15 minutes;I was up watching TV when there was a bright light in my backyard.  I got out of bed and looked out of my window.  There was a large circular object about 15 feet long by 8 feet high.  As soon as I looked out the window I saw it.  The object let out a white beam with streaks of light.  This object then lifted into the sky.  It was hovering about 1000 feet up then it flew away about a mile or two and was seen hovering around for about 10 minutes before vanishing.  The object was yellow and white in color.;40.1751;-74.8539

As we continue to watch the formation breaks apart and the lights go out.   We pull over to get a better look and there was another on looker taking notice to the lights.   We no longer can see the lights until mins later one by one the lights appear over head.   One mile apart spread the lights were apart. The lights gave off a reddish orange brilliant light.;40.1751;-74.8539
