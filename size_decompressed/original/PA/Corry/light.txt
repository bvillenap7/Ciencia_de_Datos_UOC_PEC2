WE WERE OUT IN THE BACKYARD CLEANING UP AFTER A NEIGHBORHOOD PICNIC WHEN ONE OF US SPOTTED A LIGHT SPEEDING ACROSS THE SKY. WE CALLED FOR OUR FATHERS AND THEY GOT TO SEE IT ZOOM ACROSS THE SKY.THEY HAD TO AGREE THAT IT WAS MOVING WAY TOO FAST TO HAVE BEEN A PLANE AND IT HAD NO FLASHING LIGHTS.

Bright light and beam vanishes into thin air;2009-09-18 20:15:00;1 min;Bright light and beam vanishes into thin air My son and three friends and I were on our way home when we stopped at the stop sign by the high school in Corry. One friend saw the light and said look at that star. I said that's not a star. We watched for about a minute and then it made a cloud and began to fade. It just vanished with no trail or anything. It was a very bright,white light almost like the light from a helicopter and shone down toward the ground.It looked like a beam trying to illuminate something. The sky was clear so it didn't get covered by a cloud and the brightest star in the sky was right beside it.It was perfectly still not like a helicopter. Amazing!!!!;41.9216;-79.658
Bright Orb moving slow and low across the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible ISS sighting?  PD));2013-08-20 21:40:00;1-2 minutes;Bright Orb moving slow and low across the night sky. My wife and I were in our yard star gazing with my brother.  We both have telescopes and are outside looking up all the time at night.  I take many pictures of the stars with my Cannon Powershot.  That night to the north at 9:45  was a bright round ball in the sky moving west-south west.  It was moving slow and was low.  I took my camera and zoomed in, it was like a very bright energy ball.  I took a short video of it.  I'm always looking up and will always do so with an open mind. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible ISS sighting?  PD));41.9216;-79.658
