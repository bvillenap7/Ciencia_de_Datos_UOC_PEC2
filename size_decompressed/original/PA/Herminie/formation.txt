While my 10 year old daughter and I were watching the Perseid Meteor Shower on the morning of August 12th, at 0330 hrs, she noticed 3 lights crossing the sky to the north of our location.  I did not see the lights at first, but as they crossed the center line of our view, I saw them.  They were very dimly lit and in a formation of the letter L (one light at each point). To describe the visibility and brightness of the light, picture in your mind a flood light seen in the distance on a foggy night.  They were only visible if I squinted. The sky was clear and the stars were brightly visible.  I could not see navigation lights or contrails.  They were fuzzy lights heading in an NW direction at a constant speed.  My daughter became scared and ask if the lights were flying saucers.  I told her they were planes.  I had no answer to give. I am not convinced that there are visitors coming to earth, but who can explain what we saw?;40.2472;-79.7126
