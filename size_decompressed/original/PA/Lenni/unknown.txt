Moving objects in astro photographs;2017-11-23 00:55:00;11 minutes;Moving objects in astro photographs I took Astro-photos back in November.  I just realized the other day that there are multiple objects moving through the field of view.  Not sure what they could be.  Here is the url of the 18 images assembled into a video:   https://www.flickr.com/photos/52623957@N02/39523150454/in/dateposted/ ((NUFORC Note:  We have watched the video, and a number of very small objects appear to pass across the bottom of the screen, moving from right to left.  We do not know what the objects are.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD));39.8928;-75.4466
