September 19th 2009 in Jim Thorpe Pennsylvania we were at a Bluegrass festival at our local lake. At approx. 8pm myself and 4 others were walking to our cars when my friend said what the hell is that..we all turned towards the lake and in the sky was a bright light almost like a bright spotlight with beams of white light rays it hovered for approx 30 seconds and it vanished into thin air.  It just got less visible.  It made no noise and as it vanished it left a blueish aura ring in the sky for about 30 seconds.  Nassa is claiming it to be a rocket...ut I know what I saw it was no rocket. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.8722;-75.7392
3 spherical bright white lights turned into a dim bluish light moving fast horizontally;2009-11-24 18:30:00;5 minutes;3 spherical bright white lights turned into a dim bluish light moving fast horizontally I was in my car driving at about 15mph after just pulling out of my driveway, when I noticed flashing lights to my left. At first I thought it was just an airplane, but upon closer inspection the object appeared to be stationary. So I stopped my car and stared at it for about 2 minutes. It wasnâ€™t moving. There were 3 spherical bright white lights, with the middle light appearing slightly larger then the 2 outer lights. The lights were located about midway above the horizon. Then the lights disappeared and turned into one dim bluish light resembling a star, but a bit larger, that was moving upwards at a very high speed. Then it disappeared and scanning I saw the light again on my right all the way on the other side of the sky. It was moving very fast horizontally as a dim blue light, not blinking like an airplane would be. Then it disappeared.
