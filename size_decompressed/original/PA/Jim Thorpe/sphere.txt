At Hickory Run State Park, where I was camping for the night, I noticed a high-flying sphere miles above our heads. I told my friend who was with me outside our tent, and he agreed that it wasn't a plane, because there were no blinking lights and it moved too fast for its altitude. I told my other friend inside the tent, who was changing, that we saw this thing. He poked his head out, saw the object, and said, You've got yourself a damn UFO. The object moved across the sky above our heads and we lost sight of it from the trees a few minutes later.;40.8722;-75.7392
