Possible UFO over PA;2008-09-02 21:00:00;20 minutes;Possible UFO over PA At approximately 9 pm on September 2, 2008, my husband was outside with our dog when he came in and ask me to come out to look at something in the sky.  What we saw was a blinking object.  It was, by our line of site, just above the tree line, and looked much like the heavy air traffic in our area except for the fact that it did not appear to be moving.  At first, we thought it was aircraft, because your perception can be “off” if the aircraft are heading towards you, but our object stayed put, moving slightly to our left only once, before moving back to its original spot.  The direction, from our observation point on our porch, would be in the south west direction. I went in and got our binoculars (we don’t have a telescope) and my daughter, and we all continued to observe the object for approximately 20 minutes.  Thru the binoculars, we saw it flashing red, blue, and clear or golden colored lights.  We all agreed that the object appeared to be round. We went inside and when we looked at the sky again, around 10 pm, it was gone. As I said, the location we live has heavy air traffic at all hours of the day and night.  Aircraft appeared to be going past our object with no change in flight pattern. My husband is 48 years old, with a high school education.  He works as an equipment operator/laborer  I am 42 years old college educated, and work as an accountant. My daughter is 16 years old and a straight a student.  She is a junior in high school  Both my husband and I have seen objects we could not identify in the night sky before, but never filed reports. We reside in Central Pennsylvania, along I-80.  We would love a logical explanation of what we saw.  Please feel free to contact me via e mail, which was provided in my contact information.;41.0098;-78.3214
