The craziest thing that has ever happened in my life!!;2006-05-17 21:00:00;2 min.;The craziest thing that has ever happened in my life!! We were driving home from a resteraunt when my little brother says, Look, a UFO! No one believed him until i looked and also saw it, i told my parents to look, and they did. It was the biggest aircraft i've ever seen!! it was flying so low, it was way below the clouds, but the weird thing was, it was totally silent. Then, of course, my dad said it was probably one of the new stealth bombers, but as he said that, it got bigger, then we all said that that was wayyy to big to be a stealth bomber. As we drove away, we all had to look straight because our necks were hurting and when we looked back to see it again, it was gone!;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
Three lights, triangle shaped, not flashing, receding towards horizon very quickly.;2012-01-15 23:20:00;5 minutes;three lights, triangle shaped, not flashing, receding towards horizon very quickly. Allentown PA, Driving on airport rd, north bound, exiting LVI airport. (ABE).  Saw lights, three separate lights close together.  triangle shaped. possible airplane, but with no strobe or flashing lights,  they were steady triangle lights.  after viewing for a moment, noticed that the three lights really did not have any strobe beacons like on common air crafts. it traveled towards the north east, towards stroudsburg PA.   it traveled smooth, and apparently really fast. they diminished towards the horizon faster then normally seen by other air craft lights.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154

Out walking the dog and in the sky saw about 12 bright orange flashing objects - looked triangular - rising from just above houses - coming from an easterly direction and going west - rising diagonally into the sky and disappearing.   They were in a staggered formation and moving slowly.  The last one was not in formation, was coming from the east, heading straight west, it looked like it hung in the air for about a minute and then slowly went straight up and disappeared.   The sky was dark and clear of clouds.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154

With orange yellow and red lights on the tips I was outside taking the garbage out at 11. I looked up And these 2 aircraft started going in a circle motion around each other.  They were bright red.  Then they collided really fast.   The one stood in place while the other one flew slowly away as it got closer i could see more than one color.  It was too high up and dark to see it clearly but I would say it was a triangle.  There were orange red and yellow lights on the tips.  It then disappeared.  I was in shock;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
Reddish/Triangle/boomerang shaped U.F.O's.;2014-08-16 02:00:00;15 minutes;Reddish/Triangle/boomerang shaped U.F.O's. Reddish orbs/triangle and boomerang shapes seen.  Together about 3 at one time all seen at night looking towards west of Cumberland gardens area.  One will disappear and another would reappear simultaneously back and forth on and off.   Flying in wavy or up and down patterns.sometimes they will just stay in one area and then take of and disappear just to reappear in another area with no noise at all.   One time they flew about 8 in all from Leigh street area heading towards the mountains here in Cumberland gardens flying over homes. Two of them used some sort of stealth once they got close to the homes and you can make out is a shadow once they flew over looking triangle in shape over the homes.   I have been noticing more of these objects, especially at night over the past 2 years living here, for about 21 in all.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
Saw 7 light formation hovering over neighbor in West Allentown, PA on Sept 13th 2014 at 10:34 PM;2014-09-13 22:34:00;1 minute;Saw 7 light formation hovering over neighbor in West Allentown, PA on Sept 13th 2014 at 10:34 PM I was driving in West Allentown, PA not far from my home on Saturday, September 13th.  As my girlfriend and I were driving she pointed to a huge set of white lights that were almost hovering or moving slowly (I was driving so maybe because I was also moving) over a neighborhood. There were seven lights, maybe nine, in an arrowhead type triangle formation, basically no flat third side of the triangle shape, as it went inward.  I drew an interpretation of what I saw and can show you the drawing of light setups.  Anyway, they were all bright white lights, and as we tried to find a place to pull over, the lights dimmed to about 25% of what they were.  It blinked red once or twice before I stopped getting a clear view from trees and houses.   After about 15-30 seconds we pulled over and it was completely gone. I looked towards the local airport direction and saw nothing in the sky and I could see the stars, moon, and very clear sky.  It was weird not seeing anything in the sky only a minute after that, which makes me know it was not an airplane or helicopter.  Also this formation of lights or underneath of something, was about 400 feet above us if I had to guess.  Maybe even less. The time was 10:35 PM in Macungie/Wescosville area outside of Allentown, PA.  Time stamp of 10:36 PM calling my friend, so well say we saw it at 10:34-10:35 PM    Below is a picture of what I thought the light formation looked like.  This is the best characterized way I can describe the formation.  O O o O O  o  O   The two little circles are smaller to represent that they were higher up, not making a full triangle, but more like an arrowhead shape.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154

When I heard what sounded like a plane since the airport was close by.  I told my husband that plane sounds like he is flying really low.  So I got up from the bed and looked out my window.  When I looked out and up saw a triangle shape aircraft that sounded like a Mac truck had 8 white round lights underneath and blinking red ones at the end of it but on top and it was low saw;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
