BY 2 AM MOST OF THE FAMILY HAD GONE TO SLEEP EXCEPT FOR ME AND MY DAD AND OUR GERMAN SHEPARD, HUSKY MIX DOG, LAYKA, NAMED FOR THE FIRST DOG IN SPACE BECAUSE WE FOUND HER/SHE FOLLOWED US HOME SCRAWNY AND EMACIATED THE DAY THAT NEIL ARMSTRONG TOOK THE FIRST STEP ON THE MOON.  BY 2:30 IN THE MORNING MY FATHER AND I WERE NODDING OFF AND LAYKA WAS ALREADY SNORING BUT IT WAS TIME TO PUT HER OUTSIDE BEFORE RETIRING FOR BED. MY DAD LET HER OUT THE BACK DOOR A COUPLE OF YARDS FROM WHERE I STOOD AND I HEARD HIM SAY OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT? THEN HE CALLED ME TO LOOK AT SOME STRANGE LIGHTS.  WHEN I GOT TO THE DOOR I COULD ALREADY SEE WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT AND I COULD HEAR THE DOG START TO GROWL.  UP IN THE SOUTHERN SKY ABOUT 100 - 200 METERS FROM OUR HOUSE WAS THREE PULSATING, BRIGHT LIGHTS OF WHICH WE COULD DECIPHER A HUE, IT WAS EITHER YELLOW YELLOW THEN GREEN OR YELLOW GREEN YELLOW (THAT'S THE ONLY PART THAT GOT HAZY OVER THE YEARS)THE REASON IT WAS SO ODD WAS THAT, RATHER THAN JUST RESEMBLING AIRPLANE LIGHTS THEY JUST STOOD THERE IN THE SOUTHERN SKY, AS IF HOVERING, AND NOT MAKING ONE SOUND!!!  BEFORE WE EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO DISCUSS WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT THE THREE LIGHTS SEPARATED INTO THREE DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AT AN INCREDIBLE RATE OF SPEED (THE TWO OUTER CRAFT GOING EAST AND WEST AND THE CENTRAL CRAFT SPRINTING DUE NORTH.  OUR MOUTHS DROPPED...OH MY GOD  DID YOU SEE THAT? WITHIN MINUTES WE WERE BACK IN THE HOUSE HAVING A CUP OF TEA AND MY FATHER WAS RELATING THAT HE HAD SEEN SOMETHING SIMILAR AS A KID GROWING UP IN BRASIL.  I SUBSEQUENTLY HAD ANOTHER U.F.O. EXPERIENCE IN BRASIL TWO YEARS LATER IN 1978 WHILE ON A SHORT JAUNT NORTH OF RIO INTO THE MOUNTAINS OF PETROPOLIS AND THERESOPOLIS.  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE EVER SHARED THIS STORY PUBLICKLY.

PD));2007-06-05 22:00:00;20 minutes;Extremely bright 'twinkling' star-like light hovering in cloudless night sky. Husband and wife witnessed extremely bright light in WNW sky, aprox 45 degrees between directly overhead and western horizen.  Object had very bright, twinkling glow, little if no movement in any direction.  Gave impression of the Christmas Star with twinkling rays sparkling outward.  Slight hints of red and green visible occassionally.  With 10X50 binoculars, an outline of rows of lights (estimate 8 or 10) could be seen.  Also, with binocular observation, object could be seen to be rotating as the rows of lights turned out of sight and reappeared. Couple observed object for approximately 30 minutes, during which time it seemed to hover in place although the rotation of the earth was moving the line of vision out of sight due to trees.  Night was cloudless, stars and aircraft also clearly visible.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
orange light making  two 90 right turns over s whitehall pa;2009-03-06 20:45:00;10-12 seconds;orange light making  two 90 right turns over s whitehall pa At approximately 8:45 tonight my fiance and I were in our outside hot tub . I was facing North and she was facing south. A light appeared crossing over the north side of our home moving what I though was too fast for an airplane. As I observed this and about 4-5 seconds the object made an almost 90 degree right and headed north for maybe one or two seconds.  I then pointed it out to my fiance , but the object made another 90 degree right turn and in about another 5 seconds was gone heading east. I jumped out og the hot tub and ran to the north side of our home but it was gone.  There was no sound and it was moving quite fast.  It was orange in color, but almost as it had seen me as I pointed, it turned and was gone.  I am still shaking from this.  And wondering if anyone else opbserved what I saw tonight.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154

Two bright orange lights appeared from over a mountain South then hovered for about 2 minutes the disappeared East;2013-05-27 21:00:00;5-8 minutes;Two bright orange lights appeared from over a mountain South then hovered for about 2 minutes the disappeared East May 27th , 2013 at about 9:00 Pm.  My husband and I were sitting on our back porch which faces south.  Behind the city line we can see a mountain range, and at about 9:00 Pm two orange orbs apperaed to be moving in our direction (North) above the mountains. 	The two orange lights seemed to be coming closer, they seemed to hover for about 2 minutes, then simultaneously they turned (East) and slowly they both disappeared from our sight.  We walked in that direction to see if we could spot them again but we did not see anything. 	At about 9:10 Pm that same evening, approximately 5 minutes after the orange lights disappeared, we saw a white light come from the same direction the two orbs came from (South).  The white light then followed the same path as the orange lights (East) then disappeared. 	We seemed especially intrested in these sightings because we witnessed the same two orange lights two years ago on July 4th, 2011.  The lights came from the exact same place as the ones on May 27th (South) but on July 4th the lights quickly reversed into the same direction from which they came from (South) and quickly shot out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with husband and wife, and we found them both to be sober-minded individuals.  We suspect that they are very good witnesses, and very reliable.
