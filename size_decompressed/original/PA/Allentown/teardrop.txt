As I was driving to work Monday afternoon, I happened to glance into the sky.  I wasn't wearing my sunglasses, but instead my driving glasses.  The sky was clear when I noted 3 very small objects leaving small -what appeared to be-jet streams behind them.  What really caught my attention was they were almost like hanging midair and very high in the sky.   Then each would move in a different direction, doing loops and turns. I first thought it may be an air show somewhere in the distance.  I was driving west on Route 22, and continued watching when it looked like a larger jet was coming from my left toward the objects and then lost sight of them.  It was very interesting,  I described them as tear drops simply because they were so tiny and left the trail when they maneuvered in the shape of a small tear.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
