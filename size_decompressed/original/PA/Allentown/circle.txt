Cluster of lite blue lights;2012-08-25 21:00:00;130;Cluster of lite blue lights Driving home from Tamaqua PA on the turnpike at aprox 9 pm on 8/25/12 , there were lights across the sky (southeast to northwest).   A line but not a straight line in front and above us on the northeast extension on the turnpike.  Odd light that at first guess was radio tower lights or helicopter lights or stars clustering the big dipper.  But none applied. I am a pilot and I know what aircraft lights look like.  Didn't have( or anyone else of a matter of fact) a lick of alcohol. It was me  my wife dad and mother inlaw riding together.  Anyway it was just strange to me.

There are no pictures sorry could not pull over;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
