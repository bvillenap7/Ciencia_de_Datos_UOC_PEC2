((HOAX??))  floating,glowing torus of light seen in neighboring yard.;1971-07-25 00:00:00;3 minutes approx.;floating,glowing torus of light seen in neighboring yard. a quick description of where I was when this happened.front bedroom,second floor,south facing window,overlooking neighboring yards.I was getting ready to go to bed and realised that my room was too warm.so I went to open the window,and looking out I noticed a very unusual thing in one of the neighbors yards.directly in front of the entrence to their garage was a floating,glowing,circle of light.I dont know if circle is correct.a torus of indescribable,beautiful light.the light did not illuminate any thing other than itself.at first glance I thought there was a fire in my neighbors yard.then I realised what I was looking at.something completely unknown to me.as I watched it hover there,it began to rise straight up,slowly.then when it reached the level of the garage roof it changed direction from rising straight up to an angle of approximetly fifty degrees and proceeded very rapidly upward,northward,and out of my field of vision.I was fifteen years old then,Iam fiftyone now and not              a day goes by that I do not think of that strange and yet very beautiful light.I can only call it light because there were no indications I could perceive that it was anything other than light.such as seeing something made of metal and saying I saw a shiny metallic object.nope,only light.I have no evidence to prove my statement.however sometime after the incident I took a picture of the spot where it occured.I still have the photo.you may have it for your files if it helps in keeping track of where these events occur.ps.I forgot to tell you the size of the thing. approx.two feet across by one foot high.

One object, too far to see size and shape, one blinking light  red/green/white.  Stayed in oproximately same spot for about 30 minutes ;1998-01-01 01:42:00;30 minutes +;Summary : One object, too far to see size and shape, one blinking light  red/green/white.  Stayed in oproximately same spot for about 30 minutes +.  Seems to be hovering pretty high off the ground, but too low for a star. We viewed this object with a 10/50 binoculars.  We can only see that it is a fast blinking light, it was too far to see, about 20 miles away.  It blinked rapidly red, green and white.  It didnt move much, just seemed to hover pretty high off the ground, not moving fast at all. But a couple 1000 feet high off the ground, deffinitely not a star.  We called the airport and they showed nothing on radar, which was a 40 mile distance, and it was with in that proximity.  There were 4 of us that observed the UFO.  First was Carl, 45, no prior arrests, and didnt drink anything all night.  Second was Phil, 15, no drinks and no arrests.  Third was Pat, a little alchohol, and no prior charges.  Fourth was Rick, 26, no prior arrests, very little to drink.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
Saw a low-flying line of green light in the sky for a few seconds, that looked like a meteor or something.;2006-09-08 19:50:00;5 seconds;Saw a low-flying line of green light in the sky for a few seconds, that looked like a meteor or something. Was driving South on 309 by the 78 junction next to Dorney park, and off to the right I saw a green line of light in the sky for just a few seconds.  My immediate reaction was, oh, a shooting star, only to realize a milisecond later that shooting stars aren't green or that low.  I doubt it was a craft of any kind, but it was something. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that some meteors can give off green-colored light.  It is a result of the copper content of the meteor.  Copper ions give off green light.

Many brightly lit objects emitting multi-colored lights, two military planes approached directly  and flew around several times.;2007-04-19 10:00:00;6 hours;Many brightly lit objects emitting multi-colored lights, two military planes approached directly  and flew around several times. 25-50 objects seen. One, which was the brightest was emitting multi-colored prismatic light schemes. All others were formed around it, also emitting prismatic lights, although not AS bright but still brighter than any star and hovering in the sky.   They, initially appeared to be stars, but lacked the normal celestial formations and locations. Some were remaining in line formations.  At around 10:00 pm, two military planes began approaching at extremely high speeds (drastically faster than commercial jets) and were approaching a grouping when one plane flew past the grouping and made a very sudden and precise right turn in the sky and began flying towards another grouping in unison with the other plane which was simultaneously approaching the same group as though planned. They both continued to fly past that group and then circle once more by a different grouping.  The planes were obvious in their approach towards the objects.  One object in particular seemed to move slightly out of the line of the plane and after that is when the first plane quickly changed direction towards the right.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
Two bright white lights.;2010-10-02 20:00:00;5 to 10 seconds;Two bright white lights. On Oct 2nd at approximately 20:00 I accompanied my wife and two friends outside while they had a cigarette. Looking to the east I noticed two bright lights come into view about 30 degrees above the horizon and only a few degrees apart from each other with the one on the left slightly above the one on the right. The lights were extremely bright and pure white with no flicker. The lights stayed where they had appeared for a second or two then slowly moved to the right where they then faded out to nothing with the one on the right fading slightly before the one on the left.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154

While looking straight ahead down the roadway, I noticed an object fly straight across the highway.  It appeared to be a ball of white light, which was traveling very fast from a southernly direction heading north.   As quickly as I saw the ball it was gone. I am a professional truck driver and have been driving for nearly five years.  I have never seen anything like what I saw that evening.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
