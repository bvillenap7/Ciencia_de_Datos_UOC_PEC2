SEEN  2  PALE GREEN  FLYING SAUCERS OVER ALLENTOWN , PA   ** JULY 4TH 1977/78 **;1978-07-04 23:59:00;1 MIN.;SEEN  2  PALE GREEN  FLYING SAUCERS OVER ALLENTOWN , PA   ** JULY 4TH 1977/78 ** SORRY, I AM THE ONLY EYE WITNESS THAT I KNOW OF REGUARDING THIS INCIDENT.  I SAW 2 DISCS (SAUCER SHAPED) PALE GREEN IN COLOR ONE FLYING SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF THE OTHER AND THEY WERE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD OR LARGER,  THEY SEEMED TO BE SLIGHTLY ROUNDED ON THE BOTTOM AND SMOOTH NO WINDOWS,LIGHTS OR ANYTHING JUST SMOOTH.  THEY WERE CUTTING THROUGH THE CLOUDS RIGHT OVER MY HEAD OVER JORDAN PARK IN ALLENTOWN,PA.  THEY DID NOT MAKE A SOUND AND WERE TRAVELING IN A  NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST DIRECTION.  I WOULD SAY THEY WERE TRAVELING AT ABOUT 500 TO 600 MPH, AND I WATCHED THEM CRUISE ABOUT 20 MAYBE 30 MILES UNTIL OUT OF SIGHT.   THIS SIGHTING HAPPENED IN 1977 OR 1978 ON JULY 4TH NEAR MIDNIGHT AND THE DIRECTION THEY FLEW IN WAS IN THE DIRECTION OF A LOCAL AIRPORT KNOWN AT THAT TIME AS THE A.B.E. AIRPORT (ALLENTOWN,BETHLEHEM,EASTON AIRPORT) BUT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE LEHIGH VALLEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.  I BELEIVE THEY MUST HAVE SEEN SOMETHING ON RADAR BUT I DID NOT SEE ANY INFORMATION IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER AT THAT TIME REGARDING THIS INCIDENT.   I WISH I WOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF VERIFICATON OF THIS SIGHTING VIA RADAR RECORDS ETC.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154

I was leaving from the side entrance of Pathmark grocery store on Hanover Ave and was stopped at the red light. I noticed a silver saucer hovering above the row homes to my left.  It may have been about 150 ft above me. There was no sound or air movement coming from the craft.  There were little squares that may have been windows going around the top part of the craft.  I saw no lights. I got the attention of the man in the car aside of me and pointed to the craft, he was surprised.  The light changed and I made a left on Hanover Ave still in view of the craft and darted into the gas station where there was a group of people gathered. I asked them if they could tell me what that thing was as I pointed to.  They were shocked.  I quick left to follow it as it floated very slowly above Hanover Ave.  I flashed my lights to on coming cars to get them to look up.  I followed the craft till it got to Dorney Park.  It was floating over the park for about 5 minutes when all of a sudden it dropped and then shot up in the sky and was gone. I drove around looking for it but had no luck.  I called the ABE Airport to see if they knew what it was and they didn't.  They gave me a number to report it to in Washington.  I called and filed a report at that time.  I recently research the files and didn't find my report.  I purposely stopped people on the street so that in the future I wouldn't question the incident. I was very close to the craft and couldn't believe how quiet it was and the fact there was no wind or air being emitted. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was very close to the craft and was going very fast and appeared to be very close to the small plane. The craft was on the same side of the plane as us but was about 1/6 small.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
White, disk shaped, and very fast.;2000-09-18 08:00:00;3-5 minutes;White, disk shaped, and very fast. It appeared to be white, it was still at first, then it changed directions many times, then I couldn't see it anymore.  There was only one.  There was also an airplane near by.  It was strange because the airplane turned around-- one minute it was going toward the object and the next it flew away.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
A pulsating light hovering over Allentown, PA 2 miles west of LVIA;2008-07-31 21:15:00;15 minutes;A pulsating light hovering over Allentown, PA 2 miles west of LVIA As I was sitting on my front porch I saw a bright white light pulsating about 2 miles west of the LVIA airport in the sky at the cloud line and it was moving SSW at a slow rate towards center city Allentown. Then it just stopped and hvered under a cloud and we could see a airplane fly 1000 feet right over it. It stayed in one spot for about five minutes pulsating, then it traveled slowly NW over Allentown out of sight range.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
Slowly hovering disk shaped object with a four pronged star-like shape on the bottom flying 60 feet above tree level.;2008-08-28 21:30:00;1 minute;Slowly hovering disk shaped object with a four pronged star-like shape on the bottom flying 60 feet above tree level. I just came home from Band Camp around 9:20, and when I was rounding the corner from the CVS, I see something bright in the sky. I point out to my mom, Hey, look, we can see Venus tonight!. She then says That's not Venus, it's blinking. I look closer to find out that it is, indeed blinking. It almost looks like a helicopter roughly a mile away. But when we (My mother and I) turned the corner, it was out of our view for, say, 10-13 seconds. We came up on my road and it looked like it was 200, give or take 50 feet.  Well, I told my mom, Hurry, speed up and find it, it looks close!. She drove forward, and it looked much closer than I'd thought, and we could literally see it moving across the sky, 50-70 above the houses. We looked at it for around 20 seconds, and as if it saw us, it started to fly away, speeding up to around 50 miles an hour. Then next thing I know, it just completely zooms off out of sight of the sky within seconds.

Red Saucer does a loop around Allentown before disappearing.;2014-08-11 00:15:00;10 minutes;Red Saucer does a loop around Allentown before disappearing A flashing red light with a simultaneous white light, and was saucer shaped (a circular figure with a football shape through the center.  Could also be described as a round diamond or much like Saturn with the rings, except a solid red flashing light.)   I was looking at the stars at night when a blinking like distracted me.  At first, I thought it was a plane, but upon closer inspection, the shape, colors, behavior and strangeness determine a UFO.   The round object looked about 2 to 3 times bigger than a plane.  It moved incredibly slow and hovered, and would slowly zig zag up and down and then would sit stil and move quickly along.   The flying object traveled from the south of Allentown to the west.   When trees were blocking the UFO, I ran to the front of my house and no longer saw it.  After about five minutes, the UFO reappeared from my left (West) and traveled to my far right (North) within minutes before disappearing.  The stars in the sky appeared to have a reddish twinkle, and the night sky looked active with distant faint flashes of light  surrounding individual stars (I swear I'm mentally soundâ€¦)  But the one-second flashes almost seemed to be charging the UFO before taking off.  Similar to lighting or electricity touching an object, each star was encompassed or surrounded by these static flashes of light-energy.   I took video but my iPhone couldn't focus in the dark.  Really amazing experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides little contact information.  PD));40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
