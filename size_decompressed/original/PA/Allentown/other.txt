The size of it was astonishing. Many white or pearl looking cubes attached by rods that looked like silver metal. The object was huge and covered a large expanse.  It was moving slowly and was very low.I did not get any of the other names of the witnesses since they ran and hid behind large columns at the art museum.  I am unsure if anyone else seen it.  The object was flying over building at 5th and Hamilton st. in our town and it almost appered to be stopped. It made no noise. The object was so large I doubt if it would have fit into a football field.  I went inside my office to get another worker and when we got outside the object was gone.  I never seen anything in our newspaper and I never reported it before.  I've always been curious as to what I seen and what it was. I can be E-mailed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We would like to receive reports from other witnesses to the alleged event.  PD));40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
bright round white-ish object north of allentown PA;2007-01-07 16:30:00;30 sec.;bright round white-ish object north of allentown PA Driving north on 476, daylight, 4:30pm, my friend sitting next to me in the car tells me to look at that.  At first glance I thought it could have been a meteor, but as I watched it, it did not move. The object was round, light yellow to white, it seemed to be at the height of a cruising altitude jet, but much larger than a jet (at that altitude a jet would look like a sewing needle with tiny flashing lights) this object seemed to be the size of a half dollar in comparison. The object was completely still for 20-30 seconds and then vanished (there were no clouds around the object when it did so). The object then reapeared about 40 seconds later, much further north, apearing smaller (dime size), was stationary ruoghly the same amount of time, then disapeared again.;40.6011315950919;-75.4830469325154
Series of lights in a flying string.;2014-12-18 08:03:00;5 minutes;Series of lights in a flying string. This morning I was driving to work in Allentown, PA, and I saw what looked like white Christmas lights (a series of white bulbs spaced fairly far enough apart that I could see them separately from a distance) flying in a few strands.  They looked to be in an arrowhead formation like birds would fly in.  If I had to guess, there were probably about 30 bulbs total.  I could not see an airplane in front of it, although the location it was seen is fairly close to an airport.
