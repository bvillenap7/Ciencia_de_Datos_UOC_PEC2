6 fireballs traveling in Pennsylvania.;2012-07-29 21:30:00;15 - 20 minutes;6 fireballs traveling in Pennsylvania. I was driving east on US Rte. 30 in Gap, PA. As seen in my videos, there are 6 fireballs of reddish color traveling northwest in a variety of groupings, in pairs, and then realigning to a triangle (three balls) and the remaining 3 traveling behind in singles. I pulled over on US Rte. 30 and began to film this with my Iphone 4GS. I then contacted two of my friends and drove 1000 feet to them and video taped another short video and they were also present to witness this strange activity. I have videos and would like to know the best way to submit them.;39.9997;-75.9936
