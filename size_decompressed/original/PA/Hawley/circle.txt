Object moved slowly across tree tops and made sound.;1969-07-25 00:00:00;don't know;Object moved slowly across tree tops and made sound. We were night fishing on the banks of the  River. Just looking up at the stars we were 12 yrs old at the time and we had never heard of ufos so we had no idea what it was . So to us it was just something that happen . As we were looking up this thing just moved very slowing across the tree tops .It was round it made no sound  there were lights coming out of it and they were all different colors. It also look like there were windows that went around the middle. It took up the whole area. The colors were shooting out of it.We have no idea how long it lasted but .It was something to see it wasn't till we got older that we knew what we had seen. I can still see it today.
