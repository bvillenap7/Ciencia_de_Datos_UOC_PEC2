Stationary Star Zips off, leaving blue/green trail high in the atmosphere;2015-08-19 02:00:00;10 seconds;Stationary Star Zips off, leaving blue/green trail high in the atmosphere On the morning of August 19,2015 Approximately 2:00am, Me, my brother and good friend were with our family at our vacation home located in Hawley Pa. We were in the backyard hanging out around the fire pit drinking beers, the night sky was beautiful and clear, you could clearly see stars and if you really paid attention you could catch shooting stars. All 3 of us are now very intently paying attention to the beautiful sky looking for shooting stars, while staring at the sky I notice what looks to be a bright star, very high in the atmosphere but closer then what a star looks like, I kept staring at it and even pointed it out to my brother and friend, while we continue to stare at what we think is a bright star, it then just disappears almost like a shooting star yet the entire time it seemed stationary until it zipped off, all 3 of us immediately start yelling at each other saying “OMG did you see that, I can’t believe we just witnessed something like that”  In the aftermath we noticed a blue/green trail just sitting in the atmosphere approximately where the UFO was sitting, and seemed to linger for a while, we told our parents and were not believed.  Because of the distance we could not tell what shape or color it was.;41.4787000000001;-75.1977999999999
