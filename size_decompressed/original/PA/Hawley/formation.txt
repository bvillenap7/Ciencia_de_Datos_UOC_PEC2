5-18-13 sun-colored light in three formations in Wayne county PA (town of Hawley).;2013-05-18 23:50:00;10 minutes;5-18-13 sun- colored light in three formations in Wayne county PA (town of Hawley). I was at Lake Wallenpaupac in Watne county at about 10:30pm, when I saw a formation of sun- colored lights comming from the direction of Milford, PA wich is tward the eastern part of the state.   There were about 10 to 15 lights in the formation.  As they flew over the lake, they movrd tward the rite behind a group of tall trees and at that point I lost sight of the formation.  A second then a third formation of lights flew in the same direction, and did the same minuvers as the first formation.  All in all, there were about 35 to 50 of these light/crafts, and the whole incident took about ten minutes.   There was no sound at all, and they moved much to slow to be any kind of airplane.   As for their color, they were a very brite yellow in the center, and the futher from the center you got, the darker they became, till you could see an outline on the edges.  They flew very low in the sky, mabey 1500 to 2000 feet so I got a very good look at the formations.;41.4787000000001;-75.1977999999999
