I was leaving work when I looked up in the sky and saw a round silver object and a cigar silver shaped object up in the sky.  The round object was to the left of the cigar shaped object.  They both just stood there, silent, hovering.  I watched as a couple of airplanes flew by in the distance above and below these objects. I pulled out my camera and the circle object disappeared.  I put my camera down and the circle object reappeared to the right of the cigar. I managed to film a little bit of it on my cellphone.  The round object would disappear, then the cigar shaped object disappeared. I put my camera down and they reappeared. It lasted for about a half hour before both disappeared.  I did a search on the internet to see if anyone else saw what I saw and found an old report almost exactly a year ago in the same city of a sighting in Concordville with a round  and a cigar shaped object.  I am a paralegal and this is the third sighting that I've reported to Nuforc.  I do not know what it is, but I am curious and fascinated and just want to know what it is!  I've ruled out airplane because I saw a couple fly by. I've ruled out drone because the hovering crafts did not look like them and no sound and they disappeared to the naked eye and reappeared.
