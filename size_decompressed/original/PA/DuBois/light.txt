I was on my front porch enjoying the evening sky.  In between the Big Dipper and Polaris (from my perspective seated on my porch, it was to the right of Polaris and to the left of the Big dipper), what I originally thought was a star began to significantly increase in brightness.  It then began moving slowly downward in relation to Polaris and the big dipper.  It then began moving slowly left at 90 degrees toward and below Polaris from its downward movement before fading completely.  I can't say for sure that it wasn't an airplane, but it appeared too high for landing lights, and it was not blinking.;41.1285;-78.7494

Lasted 3 min then vanished I was driving into town to stay in the Comfort Suites on December 6th, 2017.  On I-80.  I was listening to music, so I didn't hear if there were any sounds.  I noticed 1 ball of light, fuzzy on the edges above me.  I did not think much of it.   The light soon changed to 3 lights.  I became aware at this point.  I pulled to the side to look up to see 5 balls of light.  They hovered slowly moving around for about 3 minutes and then they disappeared.  I had an odd feeling the rest of the night.;41.1285;-78.7494
