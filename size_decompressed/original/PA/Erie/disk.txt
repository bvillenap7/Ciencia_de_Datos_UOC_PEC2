We we were on our way home from camping and pulled over at a gas station to go to the bathroom.  The gas station had only one other patron who was inside.  As we left we saw three disk-like objects fly over head, hovering occasionally over certain areas.  We saw them for about a minute or minute and a half before they took off at a very fast speed.  There were only a few lights, maybe 5 to 10.  Occasional spotlight beams came from the craft, they were not very bright but they were visible for a long distance.  No beings were sighted.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
Three disk like objects flew over Erie, PA at around 3:15, there were lights and not any noticable noise.;2006-04-05 03:15:00;45-60 seconds;Three disk like objects flew over Erie, PA at around 3:15, there were lights and not any noticable noise. My buds and I had been at a night class for college when these three disk shaped objects flew over head.  They paused over some areas and had some dim but far shining lights.  There were other lights too, about 10.  After about 45 seconds to a minute the objects started going really fast until we couldn't see them any more.  It was really strange.  As it went over the dog started barking, but when the object was gone the dog stopped.  Maybe really high frequencies.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272

It was a clear night sky and i was busy doing my job.  As i look up into the sky, i notice a military aircraft in the sky it was flying pretty low so i stopped and watched it fly over me.  As the airplane starts getting closer all of a sudden the aircraft lights (headlights and blinker lights go out)  So then, i am like where did this plane go can't see it at all.
