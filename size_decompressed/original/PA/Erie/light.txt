War of the Worlds;1973-07-01 00:00:00;1/2 hour;War of the Worlds It was the early 70's. It got very hot at night and we used to sleep every night in tents in the back yard to stay cool. We were sitting beside our tent and I looked up at the stars as I always loved to look at them. There was a red star that caught my eye and all of a sudden, a red light about the same size of the star came from it and moved at least 5 time faster across the sky than any plane I ever saw to this day. I ran in the house to tell my grandmother about it. She came out within seconds and it had already reached the other side of the house. We were all in awe over this and then all of a sudden there were many of these lights all looking like they were coming from every star in the sky. It was really weird because they all looked like they were the same color of the twinkling star they came from. This was definately not a meteor shower. I watch them every chance I can. All the lights moved from one end of the sky to the other crossing each others path as if they were just missing each other. They never left a trail and just looked like stars moving across the sky. The lights never went out and it lasted at least a half hour. They never blinked like the stars they seemed to have came from.  It kind of freak my other family members and after a small amount of time they would not even admit it happened. There was a write-up in the paper shortly after that, that many people had saw the same thing. I can't remember exactly what the article said but I know they didn't have and explaination of what they were.  After awhile they started to get dimmer until they all disappeared. It was definately an experience I will never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272

We were looking west when appeared what seemed ;1998-07-26 00:30:00;15 seconds;Two of my friends and I were sitting on a picnic table in southeast Erie, Pennsylvania. We were looking west when appeared what seemed to be an airplane. It flew at very high altitude and was going in a southeast direction. My buddy pointed it out and shortly after I had the aircraft in my veiw, it flashed a light that was about the size of a flash bulb in a camera. Then it proceded to almost make a complete change of direction in mid-air and took off in a northwest direction, climing rapidly until it disappeared.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272

It came from the southern sky and seemed to very briefly hover over our vehicle and then it left so quickly that we were unable to determine in which direction it went to.  We had never, ever seen anything like it before in either one of our lives. The distance from the car is hard to determine also.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
White light moved north to south and faded out.;2006-07-21 23:35:00;15 Seconds;White light moved north to south and faded out. Looked up in the sky just before bedtime while waiting on the dog to pee and saw what appeared to be a bright star or planet.  The light was white and did not blink.  At first I did not notice it moving and did not give it much thought and looked away.  However, my eyes were drawn back to it as I saw it move from north to south and fade out.  I have seen many meteors (was awake for the Leonid showers) and this was moving too slow for a meteor...although, at that altitude (not sure but it seemed way up there) it must have been moving along.  Thought maybe it was a satellite that just happened to catch the sun reflecting off of it but I then saw two airplanes move in that direction.  Those were easy to identify since they had the traditional blinking lights.  The two planes appeared to be at the same altitude and moving in the same direction as the white light was moving.  I live about 2 miles from the southern lake erie shoreline and everything was moving from north to south.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
We saw 3 orange lights about 50-100 feet apart moving in tandem up in the sky.;2012-07-13 21:50:00;3-5 minutes;We saw 3 orange lights about 50-100 feet apart moving in tandem up in the sky. My husband and I were driving west across 26th at Peninsula and saw some strange orangish lights traveling in front of us up in the sky.  There were 3 lights in a kind of a arch in the sky at least 50-100 feet apart.  When I looked I could only see the lights and no other object attached.  There was absolutely no noise.  The lights kept a uniform distance from each other and moved in tandem.  Just as I thought we were getting closer to them they started going north and disappeared or left the sky. REALLY this was so WEIRD.   There was at least one car pulled over with people looking and pointing at what we were seeing.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
Erie moving lights in the sky over Lake Erie;2012-08-01 22:45:00;5-6 seconds;Erie moving lights in the sky over Lake Erie I was returning from having dinner with friends and as we were making a turning in Abels Road we saw a blue light fly across the sky.  It then changed direction and turned green then it propelled downwards as if it was going into Lake Erie.  It was too fast to be a plane and as it changed direction we ruled out the possibility of a shooting star.  We got out of the car and waited for a while.  After a minute of no sightings we decided to drive towards the area we thought that we saw it fall however after waiting by the lake for 15 minutes we saw nothing so headed back to the camp we were staying at. Later on that night I was sitting out side of my cabin and saw two very interesting things. First as i looked up there was a grouping of 3 stars in a small triangle but when i looked closely the top star in the triangle was moving slightly to the right and the snapping back to the original position like it was attached to a piece of elastic. The second was a constant flashing light coming from the Lake Erie direciton.  A pure white light at tree level.  As I walked towards the direction, there were no cars or lights to produce the flash but it continued for a few minutes.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
Bright White Light in the Sky.;2012-08-06 10:16:00;3 mins and continued...;Bright White Light in the Sky. Me and my sister went outside to take my dog out to do her business when my sister stumbles upon something in the sky which seemed to magically appear because when we looked in that direction when we first came out of the house there was nothing there.  It was coming from the east side direction going north.  We paused and just started staring at the unusual big bright light in a circle shape.  It was just slowly moving forward and seemed to rock sideways as it moved slowly.  It made no sound and continued moving until we could not see it anymore because of the trees that was blocking the view.   am sure it was not a star or flare or anything like that because it was constantly moving, and there was many stars out but they were all still except for this and it wasn't high in the sky to say it was a star.

Two groups of bright red lights hovered and moved independently in all directions for about 10 minutes over Erie, PA.;2012-09-23 20:30:00;10 minutes;Two groups of bright red lights hovered and moved independently in all directions for about 10 minutes over Erie, PA. I was walking out of a convenience store to my car a little before 8:30pm on September  23, and I noticed 3 very bright red lights in the sky, hovering in a triangle formation.  I couldn't figure out what they were it was very cloudy, so I realized these couldn't be stars or planets because they were below the cloud cover.  As I continued to watch them, I noticed they were moving, flying up, down, left, right and they moved independent of each other, so they were not connected to one aircraft.  As I watched the three red lights, a fourth one came flying from over the store into my field of vision very fast, then stopped on a dime near the other three and just hovered there next to them.  Then all 4 of them hovered, and would individually fly slowly to the left and down in my field of vision.  Then, 2 of them flew very, very close together, like they were almost touching, then separated again.  Then, one by one, they each appeared to flicker out--which prob! ably means they flew higher up into the cloud cover and out of my sight.  I watched this group for about 3 or 4 minutes. I sat there in my car a few more minutes, and sure enough, two more red lights flew from over the store into my field of vision, so they were flying from south to north.  I called my parents, who live a block away from the store, and they ran outside and saw these ones.  As I was talking to them on the phone, another one flew from south to north and joined these other two.  They hovered and flew subtly back and forth, independently, for several minutes.  Then, just like before, two of them flew so close together that they appeared to touch.  Then, they each flickered out, one by one, disappearing into the clouds. A friend of mine, who lives 1 block north of the store, said that a group of people were standing in a parking lot across the street from his house, and they were pointing and shouting things about the sky.  He regrets not going outside to look for himself. I don't know if these events are related to these UFO's, but the Internet stopped working for several hours all over the east side of Erie, and a firefighter friend of mine reported that the power went out in half of the borough of Wesleyville, which is where I saw these objects. I personally witnessed these two groups of red UFO's for about 10 minutes total, but they were already in the sky when I came out of the store, so I don't know how long they were visible before I saw them.  I don't know if the second group of 3 UFO's were the same ones I saw minutes earlier (in the first group of 4), or if there were 7 different UFO's.  There was no sound associated with this event. I am 37 years old, and I've never seen anything like this before.  I am a church music director, and I was coming home from working with my church's youth group when I saw these UFO's.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272

First thought it was a Lifestar medivac helicopter taking off from Saint Vincent Hospital which is nearby. ((MUFON Report));2018-07-02 23:30:00;several minutes;First thought it was a Lifestar medivac helicopter taking off from Saint Vincent Hospital which is nearby. The witness works at a bayside outdoor bar as a doorman.  He was collecting cover charges from patrons as they entered the bar and appreciating the bayfront skyline, most notably the Port Erie Bicentennial Tower which dominates the skyline view of Dobbins landing which is the name of the district that the bar and tower are situated in.   He first noticed the object because he believed that it was a Lifestar medivac helicopter taking off from Saint Vincent Hospital which is near the place of the sighting.  It began blinking different colors alternating between red, green and then blue and white at random intervals.  It stopped and hovered in mid air and then began making bizarre right angle turns and wild oscillation in altitude before beginning lazy swoops over the bay and then heading over to Presque Isle across the bay before coming back towards the bar. (out of respect for his employers he will let them remain anonymous) it moved from NE to SW, circled the tower a few times and then began to sweep back and forth over Dobbins landing.   His immediate reaction was to observe it and conjecture what it could possibly have been.  It was too small and too quiet to be a helicopter, but the range was too far for a civilian drone and the night was too dark to be taking drone photography.  He attempted to point out the craft to a leaving patron who was unfortunately too intoxicated to take notice of the craft.  The craft then traveled up above State Street proceeding to the S and then ascended above the cloud cover and dissipated into the cloud cover or was obscured by the light pollution of the city.  His immediate reaction was to tell his friends and immediately try and write down everything he had seen in complete detail.  He communicated this via a smartphone to three of his friends.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
