Orange Flaming Orbs fall from the sky over Lake Erie, August, 2007;2007-08-07 22:00:00;over one hour;Orange Flaming Orbs fall from the sky over Lake Erie, August, 2007 The Event occurred during a late summer rain storm. Although the rain was not heavy, the dark cloud over Lake Erie was distinct. The phenomena observed began as a casual observance of a single speck of light. We observed what appeared from the shoreline as a light perhaps a mile or two offshore. The only way we could observe this occurence was with an average powered pair of field binoculars. At first looking through the binoculars it appeared as if it might be a small boat, but closer examination revealed that this was something on fire. I quickly alerted my companion to look into the binoculars to get his opinion. He also saw this ball of flame. What happened after this first encounter was quite startling. Let me say that I have never had a close encounter and am suspect of anything currently being written about the UFO phenomenology. However the unfolding events of that night have not only startled me, but have stayed with me for the last three years. O! nly today was I able to define my observances based on other eye-witnesses who had similar sightings. They have described what they similarly saw as orange flaming orbs. Other descriptions were ascribed to them, but in my case the orange flaming orbs fits the description perfectly. I thought that one orb appearance was enough, but what makes this an even more intriguing mystery is that after this first orb disappeared beyond the Lake Erie's horizon line, another one began to fall from the low hanging dark storm cloud. I have read other accounts and descriptions of ascending lights and fast lateral moving lights but these were not like that at all. We watched as consecutive flaming orbs fell very slowly from the sky and eventually into the water. What is also amazing is how each was orchestrated in its falling velocity (extremely slow-- slower than a parachutist, so we knew this wasn't a nighttime military mission) and also that the intensity of the light stayed consistent-- from the time it appeared coming out of the dark cloud until it hit the water's horizon line. I should note that there were no sounds being emitted and no sounds of jets, airplane or helicopter engines were heard. The fact that it was a drizzling rain (with no lightning, I might add) made it impossible for this to be man-made-- such as what I thought it might be: a summer art performance by some of the local artists. No one in their right mind would want to be out in this weather on the vastness of Lake Erie. No ot! her lights appeared-- suche as boats or planes. The house we observed all of this from is remote from the city so no street, traffic or building lights could have interfered. As much as I am recreating this story, we unfortunately had no access to good night time cameras or videos, but I would testified unequivocally that this was a phenomena that deserved a full and further investigation. To continue with the observation, we stood on the back porch with a full panoramic view to the west toward Cleveland and to the east toward Buffalo. We were facing north toward Canada when these lights were observed. In the same fashion as described earlier, we observed at least 16 of these same flaming orbs extremely slowly fall from the sky and into the waters. As each one disappeared the next one began to come out from the underside of the cloud. This event went on for at least one hour. There were more that continued to fall and perhaps a whole string of them from our line of sight and down toward Buffalo, but I actually felt frightened (amazed and excited as well) and wanted to report this occurance to the Lawrence Park police, but being a skeptic and resp! ectful of this tiny suburb and being late at night I hesitated to call anyone to bring undo attention to the neighborhood. I looked in the Erie Times News the next day to see if there was a story about this light phenomena, but did not find anything, nor was there anything on the television. This event has stayed with me since 2007. It is only today that I found your reporting website and also found better descriptors based on other observances.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
Fireballs slowly descend from the sky and disappear into Lake Erie;2008-08-11 22:30:00;> one hour;Fireballs slowly descend from the sky and disappear into Lake Erie Evening of 08/11/08:  late night over lake erie. low slung storm cloud on the horizon. I and a friend were positioned facing north looking out over the lake. light rain, cool temperature for early part of August.  With the naked eye, I confirmed with my friend that there were lights out on the lake (28 miles across) as seen first with the naked eye.  Then I asked my friend if he had a pair of binoculars.  Through the binoculars it was determined at first that a small boat appeared on fire.  This first bright light was furthest East in its proximity.  Then, on closer inspection I noticed and confirmed with my friend that what we were witnessing was NOT a little boat on fire, but fire balls descending extremely slow from the underside of this low slung storm cloud.  No identifiable sounds were heard in the vacinity. No helicopters, scrambled jets nor weather planes.  The story here is eiree as the fireballs continued to fall from the sky and as the first one went down behind the horizon, another one immediately appeared and began to fall.  This happened for a period of an hour to 90 minutes.  I was a little concerned, not knowing what was happening and decided to leave the neighborhood where this sighting was occurring-- a quiet neighborhood that lines the shore of Lake Erie.   After witnessing at least thirteen of these fireballs, I left the area (my friend lives in the house overlooking the lake and was concerned as well, but not as much as I was.) I hoped that the local news had picked up on this story, but no one has ever reported any similar sightings at the same location, nor did I feel compelled to inform the Lawrence Park police.  I did not want to bring attention to the quiet little neighborhood, plus it was raining and the folks all seemed to be sleeping and not witnessing this.   Too bad, this is definitely one for the books.  I wished that I had had a powerful video camera to capture this phenomenon.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
Orange orb/fireball seen across sky.;2009-05-30 21:55:00;1-2 minutes;Orange orb/fireball seen across sky. I saw it while I was on my deck. It was an orange orb the was moving at a slightly fast pace. It made no sound and never changed direction. It was going southwest to northeast. It left no contrails nor did It flash or blink. It was below the clouds or it was bright enough to be seen without any change while in the clouds. As it was about over the City of Erie it began to to get much smaller. It disappeared then reappeared a few times then it was gone.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
March 16, 2012 ufo fireball sighting!;2012-03-16 09:00:00;9:15;march 16, 2012 ufo fireball sighting! At approximately 9:00-9:15 pm est I witnessed a fireball going west to east as i was driving up peach street in Erie pa. I was at stop light looking south as I seen what appeared to be a high definition fireball flying at such a even speed as if it was never going to stop until it crashed into something. It also appeared to be going on such a straight path.  It was not like a shooting star where u barely have time to see.  It was like a computer animated fireball that gracefully cut through space for 5-8 seconds till it dissappeared.  I can't believe I'm the only one to see this UFO or super advanced technology.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
Giant orange/red globe slowly moving across the sky.;2012-07-04 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;Giant orange/red globe slowly moving across the sky. I was on the way home from a 4th of July picnic with my family. It was 9:30 EST time and fireworks were being set off around town.  There were plenty of fireworks all around, but I looked out of the window and seen an orange/red ball of fire in the sky, sitting high above them.  It was slowly moving across the sky, almost like how the moon will follow you when you drive, but once we got about 5 miles away from it we could only see it if we looked back.  There was no noise and it was silent. No one sitting outside of their houses seemed to notice it being that they were looking in the other direction at fireworks.  There were four of us in the car who all seen it.  My husband tried to convince everyone that it was a Chinese candle balloon, but the funny thing was the last time we looked back at it before it was out of our view, you could see two planes flying towards it-all of which looked like ants in its giant comparison.   I'd say the light could've been at leas!t half the size of the moon.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
Fireball over Erie Pa. 8/18/12 duration, no more than 4 minutes.;2012-08-18 22:45:00;3.5 minutes;fireball over Erie Pa. 8/18/12 duration, no more than 4 minutes. Observed fireball, traveling east to west/southwest in the sky over Erie, Pa.  It started at a low altitude out of our eastern sky and as it traveled toward Ohio, gained both altitude and speed as it traveled.  I don't think it took more than 3.5 to 4 minutes, for this to happen.  I watched it climb until it disappeared.

5 orange/red, burning lights in zig-zag formation;2012-09-29 21:15:00;10 minutes;5 orange/red, burning lights in zig-zag formation Went outside to drop trash off at dumpster and saw 5 burning lights in the sky facing Southeast.  They were incredibly bright with an orange/red color almost like they were burning. There were five out them in a vertical zig-zag formation.  They almost looked like the number &quot3&quot in the sky.  They were suspended and not moving. Over the course of watching them, they flickered out, from top to bottom. We got a picture but it was when there were only 3 left, and it's not that great.  Tried to get video to no avail.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
3 silent fireballs over Lake Erie shoreline.;2013-06-16 00:05:00;3-4 minutes;3 silent fireballs over Lake Erie shoreline. First ball appeared in western sky just after midnight, appeared to be low altitude, silent, moving east on a direct path travel.  At the closest point over head it appeared to have a dark triangle protruding from the north and south sides of the object.   As it neared the eastern horizon over the Lake Erie shoreline another identical object appeared in the west and moved in a similar path of travel.   As this one disappeared on the eastern horizon a third similar object appeared over the west as well.  This one moved in a similar direction.  This final object appeared less direct in its path of travel ....almost wobbly for lack of a better description.   The fireball appeared to waiver and as it moved towards the eastern horizon it seemed to gain altitude until it disappeared.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
At approximately 23:55, 2 students witnessed a Large Mulicolor Aura fell in Erie, PA.;2014-05-11 23:55:00;2 seconds;At approximately 23:55, 2 students witnessed a Large Mulicolor Aura fell in Erie, PA. I was walking with my boyfriend on Mercyhurst Campus.  I looked up in the sky  facing West, and saw this very large ball of light.  By natural instict, I hit him and yelled, Check it out a shooting star!  He turned around and missed it.  It fell behind a building in a direction toward downtown toward Lake Erie.  I thought I explained that it wasn't like a normal shooting star.  It was MASSIVELY Larger.  Another student was on campus by us and he looked at me asking if I saw that thing fall in the guy.  I agreed.  And we just looked at each other and he said, Do you think it was a UFO?  I said, it clearly wasn't a shooting star.   We both discussed and shared Identical description of the falling object.  It looked at if a massive form of light was behind a cloud, it changed colors rapidly from like a lilac, to a turqouise, to a seafoam green sometimes more than one color at once, it was just fluidly multiple colors.  The size was clearly bigger than! any manmade aircraft. It gasous size was probably the size of our sun during the winter sky.  Like the size of one's thumbnail.  Big.    We both saw it fall in the same direction, down toward Lake Erie, but it fell behind the large building on campus.  It moved quietly and at a constant speed, the direction appeared though as it was crashing, but it fell being the building. But I guess it best to sum up we saw:  A large light source much bigger than a man made air craft crashing through the sky covered in a turquoise/violet/seafoam green light.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
