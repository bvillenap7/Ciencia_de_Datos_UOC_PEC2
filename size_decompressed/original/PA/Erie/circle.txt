A large green disc that travesed the night sky.;1998-08-13 22:30:00;5-7 seconds;A large green disc that travesed the night sky. I was driving  taxi for  Erie, Trans. Co. in Erie, Pa. at the time of the sighting. There was a passenger, a woman who did not, sadly, see it. I was waiting for the traffic light to change at Buffalo Road and Downing, facing true south. As I was lookng at the light, I caught sight of a large, round, lime green circle with a misty perimeter, crossing in front of the moon which was at about a ten'o clock position in the sky. It was about 1/4 to 1/3 the size of the moon, and the size remained  the same in it's orbit till it disappeared over the trees and the horizon directly south of us at 12'o clock. Although it was of a very short duration, and had happened so long ago, it's been haunting me ever since! I am reluctant to talk to anybody about it because because of the looks and reactions that I get. Accompanying this report is a color pencil rendering as accurate as I could make it. The details are still very vivid.  There was no missing time or any other strangeness about it, other than the sighting itself.  Very truly ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Bright red light hovering during 4th of July-not a firework.;2010-07-04 22:30:00;1 to 2 minutes;Bright red light hovering during 4th of July-not a firework. My family and I were watching the fireworks from a club.  My mother shouted, what is that? Do you see it??  We all looked.  It was this bright red light, looked circular from where we were.  It just appeared and then hovered there for maybe a minute, then it slowly started moving and then it was gone.  It was so bright I have never seen any light in the sky that bright.  And no, it was not a firework.  We started hearing they were investigating it and I had told a friend of mine and she says it was a firework.  That they have these disc fireworks that go up and then shoot to the side, and they come in all colors.  This was solid red, brighter than any firework I had seen.  And if it were a firework, why was it hovering?  I also want to point out that it was really high up, and I have never seen a firework that high up.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
