I was looking out a second-floor window of my house when I noticed a strange craft floating lazily across the sky.  It was orange, and looked like a blimp with the cockpit and tailfins removed.  It was huge - actually about the size of a blimp, but again with some features removed.   This coupled with the fact that I have never seen any sort of zeppelin in my area before, made it clear that this was no craft I knew about.  I could see it for about two minutes before it was obstructed from view by my neighbors' house.  It reappeared on the other side and eventually disappeared from my window.  No other strange phenomena was seen while observing the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272

I was taking my wife to work, she is a nurse and after I she got in the van and I was circling around the back of the vehicle just as I got to the door on the drivers side I saw out of the corner of my eye a very very bright dayglo yellow meteor shaped object with a meteor type tail that was bright green its trail came from the horizon to my direct left and flew in a very straight line straight over my head about fifty to 100 feet up directly to the right horizon and it only lasted about 3 to 5 seconds and then the light green and yellow completely disappeared - end of encounter.
