Bright Cylinder Shaped  Object  Makes a Showing Over Lake Erie in August 2002;2002-08-17 20:00:00;5 Minutes;Bright Cylinder Shaped  Object  Makes a Showing Over Lake Erie in August 2002 We were on a Lake Erie ferry boat for the sunset cruise and about eight p.m. we spotted something in the sky that we concluded was not a plane.  The more we looked at it the more everyone agreed that it was not a plane.  The object was verticle and, cylinder shaped and very bright, like crome.  It looked as though it was going straight up in the sky and gaining  altitude. The craft had a very small after burn, or trail of smoke, but very, very short.  I took five pictures with my 35mm camera, but it did not pick up the trail of smoke. It all took place in about five minutes.  As soon as it was there ....it was gone out of sight.  I plan on enlarging the photos I had developed to get a begtter look at it. This object was viewed by more than 20 pairs of eyes and all agreed that the object in the sky was definitely NOT a plane.  So....what ...was...it? ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length via telephone, and we found her to be lucid, sincere, and quite credible.  We do not know what it was she and the others witnessed.  We have requested additional reports from the other witnesses.  PD));42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
Cylinder ufo seems to be letting out round orbs in broad daylight.;2013-08-23 10:55:00;~3 minutes;Cylinder ufo seems to be letting out round orbs in broad daylight. I live in  Erie, Pa,,,  I was sitting in my backyard on my patio when I noticed a airplane going over at a pretty low altitude.  That wasn't too unusual since there is a airport in  the area.  The plane was kind of different since it had a double tail connected with like a bar between them.  I was still looking up when I noticed this silver metallic looking craft slowly going over head,it was hard to judge just how high it was but it clearly visible to the eye.  The craft appeared to either change shape or was spitting out something from the rear like balls of light.   I didn't have a camera with me so I took out my cellphone an took some pictures and some videos of it.In the first video u see the cylinder object looking like balls of light coming out of it the next two don't have the cylinder object just round balls of light.  The sky was blue without a cloud in sight.  See what u think.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
Cylinder object floats over no noise;2013-08-23 11:00:00;1:13;cylinder object floats over no noise I was sitting in my backyard when I noticed a plane go over not  unusual there is a airport 10-15 miles from here except  this one was kinda big flying low with one of  those double tail.aircraft with like a dividers between the tails a few minutes after that I noticed a object floating in the sky there was no clouds blue sky looked like a cylnder or cigar but most have been really high cause could not really judge size because it was high up I just know what I saw.   The object was going real low slow no sounds but it was reflecting in a all clear blue sky.  The object traveled from the northeast from the direction of lake Erie and passed my backyard and headed southwest till I couldn't see it anymore.what caught my attention was the speed to slow for a plane or chopper  it reflected light looked silver,and metallic.  what I saw next made me wonder what was going on ,  the object either changed or well in the pictures something either flashes change shapes can some o! ne tell me.  If anyone has had a similar experience l forward to see a post.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
