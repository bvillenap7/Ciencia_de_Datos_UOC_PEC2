While in my backyard looking north towards lake Erie, a large triangular shaped formation of faint lights was traveling from west to east.   The formation moved silently as it passed by, blocking out the stars behind it and the very large size of the object became apparent.   There was another string of lights traveling with it that may have been a second triangular object partially blocked by the main triangular formation.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272

(I ALWAYS look up at the sky on clear nights)  I noticed 3 blatant red Orbs of what looked like thrusters.  Spaced well apart from each other in a perfect triangle moving in Sync.  They broke formation and flew eradically in different directions before reforming back into a triangle and stalling.  Shortly after stalling they dissolved from bottom left then to top and then bottom right.  They just completely dissolved into the sky.;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
