These formations were the only objects in the sky.  A small version the dipper with 6 bright orange lights in a perfect row below the dipper like shape.  There were no other stars in the sky. Just this formation.  And a brighter blinking orange light in the west sky. It looked like a perfect framed picture against the dark navy sky.  Almost artificial.  I could not stop looking at the formation.  Then it hit me.  This is not normal.  I started getting nauseous and afraid.  I passed thru a treed area... then in cleared area could still see this.  I picked up my son but when I looked they were gone.  The sky was full of a million stars.  I then knew this was different.  I looked at the news that evening but no mention of this sighting. this lasted 4-7 minutes it was so beautiful;42.0978165110845;-80.0375993582272
