Strange objects over Route 30 Bypass in Exton Pa.;2014-02-14 22:00:00;10 minutes;Strange objects over Route 30 Bypass in Exton Pa. On Friday, February 14th, 2014, my girlfriend and I were returning from dinner and as we entered Route 30 bypass westbound we noticed 8-10 objects flying on the other side of the road, what looked like a few hundred feet up.  Since I was driving the time I had to focus on the objects was limited but was still long enough to notice that this was not a normal occurrence. The objects were emitting a red light, which at first made us think of the lights on top of radio towers.  As we began moving past them on the bypass we noticed that they were not stationary, and in fact were moving east or northeast.  It also became clear that this was not normal due to the close proximity of the lights to one another.  It seemed as if they were moving in almost a V-shaped pattern although it was not clear. Another piece of information that helped prove that we were not just seeing things was the fact that on the eastbound lane of the bypass there were a few cars stopped and with people out with their phones capturing the same thing we had just passed.  At that point though we determined that it would be best to get home and check sources for any possible information on the siting.   After not hearing anything over the past few days I figured it would be best to post what I saw and hope that someone else saw it too.;40.0443;-75.6471999999999
