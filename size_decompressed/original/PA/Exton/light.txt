Completely silent, bright, and randomly pulsating red ball or light flying rather slow over head then disappearing;2012-05-19 21:00:00;20 seconds;Completely silent, bright, and randomly pulsating red ball or light flying rather slow over head then disappearing Witnessed a silent, somewhat slow moving, pulsating red light for about twenty or thirty seconds.  It seemed to be moving in one steady direction but could possibly have been gaining altitude at the same time.  It simply pulsated a bright red light and was somewhat inconsistent with the pattern in which it pulsated. It would also blink out at random then reappear.  It finally blinked out for good and seemed to disappear when it was directly above me and probably directly over the Exton Square Mall.;40.0443;-75.6471999999999
Orange lights in the sky when there was no wind;2013-05-03 21:00:00;5 minutes;Orange lights in the sky when there was no wind On the above date I went out on my deck to smoke a cigar and let the dog out.  Upon leaving my house, I saw three orange lights in the night sky (western hemisphere) going from South to North.  It was a clear sky and the wind according to weather underground was less than 5 mph from the southeast.  The three lights were in a row then they formed a triangle until they flickered out one by one as they reached the far north. I went into my house and called my brother.  I then saw three more orange lights moving in the same direction (all the lights were moving at the same speed and about as fast as a normal plane flying at high altitude.  These three orange lights were fairly far apart and formed a triangle.  I took a photo of them with my droid phone and they look very much like the photos I have seen on youtube etc,  I assumed they were the chinese lanterns after searching for the internet, but after seeing the low wind speed, I donâ€™t know what they were.  I have never seen anything like this before and never made a report on something like this before.;40.0443;-75.6471999999999
