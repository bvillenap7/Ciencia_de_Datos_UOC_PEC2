Massive wide U shaped translucent object with 20 - 30 dim lights heading SW;2021-01-30 19:00:00;5-10 seconds;Massive wide U shaped translucent object with 20 - 30 dim lights heading SW My wife and I were walking back to our car after dinner last night in a parking lot at 7PM. She was looking at the stars, as it was a very clear night and told me to look up. (She actually said ”What the F is that?”) I looked up and saw about 20 or 30 dim white lights spread out in a wide U shape.  The space behind and in-between the lights looked to be translucent.  It was moving very fast and steady across the sky. There was no sound at all. We only saw it for less than ten seconds when it disappeared as though it vanished in a cloud. (there were no clouds.)  I could have been drones moving together, but they would have to be dragging a see through plastic film or something. Size is difficult because it was hard to tell how high up it was. It was big about 5 or 6 moons across.  We went home and both drew pictures of what we saw and then compared them. I called my friend who asked me a bunch of questions:  How fast was it moving? Very Fast and Steady, no not like someone with a laser pointer. More like a fast low flying plane.  How long did you see it? 5 or 10 seconds then it was gone.  Did the lights have color? No, they were dim or dull white lights, not very bright.  Did they move tightly as a group? Did they separate in any way? They moved tightly as a group.  He looked for other sightings that were similar to mine online and found this site and told me to check it out. There are several. I checked this morning after reading other reports and found it was also flying in a SW direction.;40.0443;-75.6471999999999
