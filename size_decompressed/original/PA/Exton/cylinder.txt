Walking dog, look up and see an object, thought it was a plane didnt see wings.  Checked my dog again looked up saw two others, one was the same size as the objec that just passed.  The new one was bigger same markings.  No sound, no wings, no tail section. Looked like white cans.  First smaller one didnt fly as straight as the other two.;40.0443;-75.6471999999999
