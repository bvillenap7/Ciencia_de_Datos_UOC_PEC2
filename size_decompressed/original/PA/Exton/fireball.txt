two glowing fireballs changing colors outside Philadelphia.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2007-02-14 23:00:00;45 mins;two glowing fireballs changing colors outside Philadelphia It was eleven o clock at night when I decided to look out my window to see if there was any snow.  In the corner of my eye there were two red glowing lights.   As I continued to look at them they change to blue then 4 seconds later to yellow and 4 seconds later to red again.   It continued this pattern whiling moving to all directions.  It was freaking me out so I got my dad.  He said it was just a helicopter but a helicopter could not change those colors or move like that and say there for 45 minutes.;40.0443;-75.6471999999999
