Bright object traveling NE to SW;2004-09-05 23:10:00;3 minutes;Bright object traveling NE to SW 5 Sept 2004 possible sighting  At approximately 11:10 pm on 5 Sept 2004 I went to the back door to let my dog out and noticed a bright object moving from NE to SW approximately 75-80 degrees from the horizon. I noticed that the object had no strobe light or navigation red/green lights on the wingtips. There was no sound from the object. The movement was like a commercial airliner:  steady rate of speed with no deviations in direction. I called my wife to look at it, which she did. We followed it until it went behind my apple tree. A commercial jet traveling from west to east went by a couple of minutes later that made a definite jet noise. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the date from October to September.  Satellites generally do not course to the west, and a high-altitude almost certainly would exhibit strobe lights, or marker lights.  PD));41.6378;-79.6875
