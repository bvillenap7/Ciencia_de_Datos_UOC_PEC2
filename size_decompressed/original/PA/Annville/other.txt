Floating flamelike object meanders across the sky;2013-05-30 21:00:00;4 minutes;floating flamelike object meanders across the sky This is the second time I have seen this object in one week.   From naked eye it looked to be a floating orangish red flame, which appeared to rise up (from the direction of palmyra?)  and make its way across the sky and up in a north easterly direction.   Same path for both sightings.    This time my wife grabbed the binoculars, and it appeared to me to be a dark circular object which was creating the triangular light pattern above it.
