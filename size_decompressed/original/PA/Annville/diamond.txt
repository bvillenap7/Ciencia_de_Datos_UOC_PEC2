On 2/14/08 approximately 20:45, I walked outside to look for the cat.  Looked up at the sky it was a clear night not to dark.  I immediately saw three lights in close proximity.  Two white with a red in the middle they were in a triangle pattern about 120 degrees at the center.  I thought it was a plane, looked away for a second when I looked back there was a second set of lights.  Tree limbs had obscured them.  These light were parallel to the first set and a mirror image of the first.  I thought for sure it was a plane.  As I watched it move from west to east at a very hi rate of speed it moved to a lighter sky and I could see a darker connecting structure between the lights.  I can’t figure out how I could see booth wing tips  if that’s what it was there was no fuselage per say and its speed was unmatched by any aircraft I have ever seen at that distance it covered my line of sight 4 or 5 seconds it wasn’t horizon to horizon but it was fairly large angle.  There was no sound.;40.3419;-76.5453
