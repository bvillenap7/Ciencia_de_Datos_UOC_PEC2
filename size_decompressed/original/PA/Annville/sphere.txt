Our college is located in a small town, so there aren't a lot of lights in the sky. My boyfriend goes, Guys do you see that? And we looked up: There were at least 8, maybe 10 or 12, circular lights in the sky in a shape of a U or a V, but wider. It looked like they were just hovering there for a few seconds. Then one or two would go out, then 3 more, and then finally they were all gone. At first we thought it was a bridge at our school, lit up with Christmas decorations fof the Holiday... so we went out to look at the bridge, and the shape of the ropes that any lights could be on is like ^, whereas what we saw was more a V. And the size of the lights, and the amount of light they emitted, were larger than any Christmas bulb decoration. I have no idea what this could have been, I've never seen anything like it in my life.;40.3419;-76.5453
