Multiple witnesses from multiple vehicles slowing to witness. While traveling toward Brownsville, Pa, my son, I, and a lot of other drivers witnessed 8-10 Orange Orbs Floating above Turnpike 43.  These things were no higher than 50 feet above the trees.  They Held steady and did not move around.   It was nearing dusk when we witnessed them and could not stop on the turnpike.   When we reached the next exit we turned around and in that time they disappeared.   There were no visible wires, nor did they move like a drone or some r/c.;40.0242;-79.8846
