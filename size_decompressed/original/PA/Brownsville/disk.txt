Glowing disk crafts in night sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-28 23:30:00;1-2 minutes;Glowing disk crafts in night sky On December 28, 2017 @ approximately 8:30 pm I noticed a very large stationary bright orangish yellow light in the southeastern sky so I hurried and got my spotting scope to get a better look. Whenever I returned and started to look at it through the scope it slow started moving north just above the trees maybe 50-100 ft.  I debunked it being a plane or helicopter because there was no noise and no flashing four lights.  It also wasn't a satellite cause it was too low.  Fully zoomed in on it the shape of the craft was very distinguished and appeared to pulsate going dim to bright.  I watched it for about a minute or two, until it was out of sight. Three hours later I was outside smoking again and noticed a similar craft moving from south to north but on the opposite side of the house.  When zoomed in all the way I saw a disk shaped craft that appeared to be spinning while moving forward.  The craft also had a rotating ring of lights dividing the craft in two.;40.0242;-79.8846
