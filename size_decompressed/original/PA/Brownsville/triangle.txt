We were at a drive in movie. About 45 to 55 degrees high between south and south east my girlfriend saw a single white dot moving along with 2 dimmer dots in a trianglular formation headed south east. The triangle was shorter on the back half and was moving very slowly. We couldn't tell if it was solid or not because it didn't pass in front of any stars. Although it was hard to tell it had the feeling of being fairly high but not quite airliner crusing heights. The lights where white and non blinking, there was no sound heard (although the drive in movie speakers were turned up high).;40.0242;-79.8846
