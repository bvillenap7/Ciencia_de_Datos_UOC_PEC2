I noticed a flash of light in the sky out my passenger side window.  I watched closely because the sky was clear.  This light flew over my car heading south west.  I watched as the light changed direstion and began to fly west hovering about 10 feet above a local elementary school.,  I watched it until it flew directly over my head and climbeed at a 90 degree angle.  Then bam all gone.  There was no sound, and no apparent release of waste from the engine.  This is the second time I have witnessed anything like this.;40.4413;-79.2533
