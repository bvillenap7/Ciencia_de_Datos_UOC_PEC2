It shot across the stars stopped still illuminated, paused a few seconds then continued to travel very very very slowly. . At this time to the very far right of this event a second light appeared.  It traveled very slowly towards the first light .  We thought perhaps these were sattilites. But satellites dont move the way these were.  Then as soon as the appeared, they just vanished against the black sky.  I kept looking up and I'm glad I did as this time there were three lights to appear flying in a triangle formation.  Travelling very slowly they were glowing white whit a hint of red towards the end of the orb shape.  They did this for about 7 seconds before simply vanishing.;40.3823;-79.0968
