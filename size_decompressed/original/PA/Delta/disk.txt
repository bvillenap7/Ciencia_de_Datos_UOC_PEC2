Space craft hovers over pond;1978-07-01 22:00:00;20 minutes;Space craft hovers over pond The four of us were playing out near the pond when we notice a light coming toward us from the distance.  Slowly it approched over the pond and dropped a long cylinder into the pond and started sucking up water.  I got scared and ran into the house to hide under the couch.  My brother runs in and says we have to tell Mom and the other parents.  We run to the next house and in panic we expalin what is going on right outside.  At first they thought we were just kidding.  But finally we got them to come outside and by that time it was moving off into the distance.  I remember seeing three little heads looking out of the craft.  The faces was not clear but you could definetly see them.  That was the time I ran into the house.  I've asked my brother about this over the years from time to time and he remembers it just as I did.  My Mom also remembers us coming to her about this.  Thats was my only sighting ever.;39.7573;-76.3445
