What ever it was it knew I was their;1979-10-15 16:30:00;15min;I was in my tree stand at the edge of a field archery hunting for deer at prime time in 1979.I was 19 years old at the time I'm 46 now.  About 15 minutes before dark the best time for the hunt.  I started to hear this very strange humming sound hovering over me it sounded very close maybe 75 feet directly over head I could see all above me but their was nothing their.  It left and came back 10 min later for less then a minute.  That's when I had an inner fear I cannot describe I dont scare easy. Then it went away.I climbed down out of my tree stand and started down through the field at a fast pace something was telling me to get out of their and scrap the hunt I made it about 100 yards down through the field when I heard the strange humming again their was a wash out from rain erosion in the field about 3 feet deep so I got down in it and stooped down low to try to hide my self.  By this time it was starting to get dark It was then I saw a beam of light come out of the sky maybe 75 feet above the tree tops where I had just been hunting right above my tree stand and lit up the whole area from the  point source in the sky to the ground scanning back and forth 3 or 4 times then all of a sudden the light vanished the humming stopped and it was gone.  I ran back to my truck and never went back till this day.  This is what it looked like take a giant flashlight about 20 feet long with a lens about 3 feet round cover it with thin red transparent plastic hold it about 75 feet above the tree tops and and scan the woods back and forth when its almost dark it was a perfect cone shaped beam with every thing  else around it dark. I dont know what happened that evening but their was something their and what ever it was it knew I was their and came back at dark to find me that all I can say except this is a true story.
