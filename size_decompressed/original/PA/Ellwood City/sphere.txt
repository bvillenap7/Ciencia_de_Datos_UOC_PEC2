I didn't remember this until recently (sept 1999-20000 Jan).  Saw this object just hovering above the third bridge on route 288(Ellwood/Portersville rd) while on my way home from a ride to Moraine State park.  The object appeared to be a gold solid sphere hovering to the right of the bridge at about two thousand feet.;40.8729;-80.2559000000001
