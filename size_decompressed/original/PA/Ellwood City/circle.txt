Red and Blue flickering object;2008-09-02 00:47:00;ten minutes;Red and Blue flickering object The sighting that took placed looked almost like a star.  Every time this star would flicker, you could see colors of red and blue.  The red color flickered at the top and towards the left, with the blue doing the exact same but on the lower right side.  I didn't give it much notice at first, being close to an airport and all, I thought it was just an aircraft.  I started staring at this object in the sky, and it didn't move. Sometimes, the flickering and the colors weren't as bright as when I first saw it, but I figured the clouds and it being an overcast night had something to do with it.;40.8729;-80.2559000000001
