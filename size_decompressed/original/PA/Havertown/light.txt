I am an ameteur astronomer and I don't necessarily believe in UFOs, but I have no explaination for what I saw. I was in my yard one fall night letting waiting for my dog to do his thing when I looked up and saw a jupiter-like bright object in the sky. My house yard faces northwest so that Polaris is in the right corner and the sun sets in the left corner. The star I saw shouldn't have been there. I was just northwest of Polaris, a few degrees  higher and as bright as Jupiter. I watched it with intrigue for a minute or so and then the object got smaller before my eyes - I mean in a matter of a minute or so - until it was a red dot and then vanished. When I first looked at it I assumed it was an airplane, but it didn't move or flash. Then I wondered if there was a comet I didn't know about.  When the thing go small and vanished I really became puzzled and told my wife and, later, some people ! I know.  Was it a rocket sent up by some ameteur rocket club? Whatever it was it moved away from the earth into space at a tremendous speed - the time it went from a Jupiter sized glowing object to a faint red dot was only a  matter of a minute or two.  I have never been able to reconcile this event with anything that makes sense so I am reporting this in the hope of some explaination.

A round shiny object appeared in the far sky.  It remained in the same spot for approximately 10 minutes.  I attempted to find a neighbor to witness as I wondered if it could be a satellite.  Because I was videoing, I did not notice if it moved after 10 minutes to another location but I could not see it any longer.;39.9776;-75.3099000000001
