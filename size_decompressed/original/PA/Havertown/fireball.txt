Very Bright ball of light off rt 3 traveling toward Philadelphia rapidly.;2011-10-24 07:38:00;1min;Very Bright ball of light off rt 3 traveling toward Philadelphia rapidly. While driving east on rt 3 saw a BRIGHT red/pink colored ball traveling east faster then I was driving.  Tried to take video but by time I got my iPod out and ready it vanished before my eyes.  It wasn't flashing so I know it wasn't a plane or helicopter.  It seemed pretty low.;39.9776;-75.3099000000001
