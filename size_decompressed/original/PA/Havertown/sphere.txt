Was heading in no direction close to Philadelphia airport.;39.9776;-75.3099000000001
Object that vanishes quickly into space.;2014-06-02 21:40:00;15 seconds;Object that vanishes quickly into space. I looked up at the big dipper and noticed a double star in Beta Majoris.  It was unusual then it moved and I thougt it was a high flying aircraft, but it make a slightly arced trajectory around the star from the east and then headed due south.   After looking at it for another ten seconds, it grew fainter and smaller and redder and then vanished.  I can only think it red shifted and went into outer space.  But it did so in the course of a second or two which would mean that it was traveling faster than anything know on earth.   I'm a skeptic and a pragmatist, but I don't have an explanation for this one.  What did I see?   I am an amateur astronomer and long-time stargazer.  I know my night sky and mathematics as well.  I didn't know who else to contact.  I know it might not seem that fantastic compared to some of the things you hear, but it's real and strange all the same.;39.9776;-75.3099000000001

It stayed completely still in the sky.  Planes overhead (we're 9 miles from an airport) were seen flying a good distance above it (both ascending and descending planes)- it did not move at all.  After about 2 hours it was gone.  People were gathered around and after awhile were caught up discussing it- when we looked back it was just gone. It was a clear Autumn day.  The weather was pleasant and cool-not particularly windy- the sky was blue without clouds.;39.9776;-75.3099000000001

I assumed it was a plane because it was coming from the direction of Philadelphia International Airport. It made no sound so I assumed it was flying high but it seemed to be moving too fast if it was in high altitude. Then it seemed to stop and fade in brightness as it got smaller and smaller till it disappeared. I immediately thought I must be looking at a rocket heading out into space but that made no sense. The whole thing happened in a span of about ten seconds. I’m an amateur astronomer and quite familiar with the night sky and the planes that cross my region. This wasn’t a plane. It was a round bright object appearing slightly larger than Jupiter in the night sky. What struck me was how fast it all happened. I was thinking, “That’s funny, a plane coming from Philly and already that high in the sky?”  Then it s! tops and heads out to o space? Weird. Did I see a UFO?;39.9776;-75.3099000000001
