If the ball on the left would move out of formation toward the left,  All 4 other balls would fall back into formation instantly. In the 10-minute ordeal we saw 3 different formations. Straight line, one out in front of the other heading straight toward us. Straight line, sideways. Side by side. Then a dice formation. 3 up top, 2 down bottom. I also took a picture of it on my phone but when I went to look at the picture, the 5 dots did not appear in the picture.
