80-W and 380-N Intersection Sighting of Cross-Shaped UFO;2010-05-23 21:00:00;30 minutes;80-W and 380-N Intersection Sighting of Cross-Shaped UFO I was driving from New Jersey to New York via W-80 at around 9 PM on Sunday, May 23, 2010.  For thirty minutes I witnessed a sighting of an unidentified flying object in the Mt. Pocono area. At around the NJ/PA border, I spotted a star as I faced west and a light approximately a handâ€™s distance below that star.  The light appeared to be red and green from afar, so I assumed it was an aircraft of some sort.  As I drove approximately for thirty minutes or so, I noticed that the light just above the horizon was getting brighter and larger.  As I came upon the intersection between W-80 and 380-N, I noticed that the craft was to my left (south of the W-80 road).  It appeared twice the size of a full moon, approximately 9-10 building stories above the ground, hovering.  It was very large in appearance.  At the time, the sun was setting so I had a little light to make out the bulk of the object. The craft seemed metallic in appearance, and seemed to have vertical metallic grooves going down the sides.  The object was dreidel or cross-shaped and had white lights on the upper, lower, right and left extremities.  It also had a red light in the middle of the craft.  There were also some blinking green lights along the top of the craft.  The craft emitted no sound, nor did it move.  I was close enough to make out the silhouette of the craft in the dim of the evening.;41.1197;-75.3481
