We were pretty acclimatized to the darkness and were able to see very well at this point.  My friend was looking slightly to the left of where the object appeared (if it was at 12 o'clock, she was looking in the 10 o'clock direction).  I was looking directly in that area.  All of a sudden this HUGE bright light just exploded in the sky right at treeline.  It was very bright and very intense, but there was no sound associated with it.  It was yellow-ish and white.   We came back to the area about 40 minutes later after investigating surrounding areas with no luck.  I saw the flash a second time after spending another 5-10 minutes looking in the sky.  The second time it was a very quick flash of light...bright, but not as large, and above treeline a little farther up in the sky.;41.1197;-75.3481
the objects were too high to be considered planes and they were not flying in a straight line.;2006-05-28 11:00:00;1 min;the objects were too high to be considered planes and they were not flying in a straight line. My girlfriend and I noticed a light traveling easterly in a strange bobbing line at an extremely high altitude for about 20 to 30 seconds.  Then it suddenly gained even more altitude and disappeared.  Just as that one was gone, another light came into view traveling in a westerly direction.  It was moving the same as the other one.  It too gained altitude and disappeared.;41.1197;-75.3481
