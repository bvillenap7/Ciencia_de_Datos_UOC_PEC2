At approximately 10pm on July 10, 2010.  A red/ orangey glowing ball of fire looking object was seen flying across the sky heading west.  At first we thought it was a plane that may have been on fire or a planet/ shooting star.  Then after observing the flight pattern we came to the conclusion that a plane cannot change directions that quickly.  The object  then cut back and flew  south east.  After that it flew straight and disappeared into the sky as it seemed to stutter.  There were no cloud in the sky.;41.4661;-75.5952
