My husband and I returned to our house from dinner and noticed a flaming ball in the sky.  We thought it was an airplane on fire since it was so high in the sky.  We watched it move across the sky and then it just disappeared.  Two additional flaming balls appeared separately and disappeared as well.  While the second one was crossing the sky, my husband ran into the house to get binoculars to see if we could figure out what they were and I took pictures with my cell phone, but it is hard to say what they were.
