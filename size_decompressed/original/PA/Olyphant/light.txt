Bright white light flying vertically into the sky followed by military jets 10min later Olyphant/Dickson City Area.;2014-09-12 18:49:00;1 minute;Bright white light flying vertically into the sky followed by military jets 10 min later Olyphant/Dickson City Area. I was out for a smoke when I noticed a bright light out of the corner of my eye. I looked at it and it kept slowly getting brighter and brighter (about a 2 second period) while remaining in the same spot.  The brightness was incredibly bright at it's climax (like a bright white spot light glow in the sky)   It then suddenly accelerated nearly directly north and straight upwards and away from me and was out of sight in less than a second.  It left a definite trail through the high wispy clouds.   I then noticed the blinking lights of a jetliner north west of its location that must have seen this light as well.   10 minutes later two aircraft in formation flew at fairly low altitude over my home in the direction of where the light originally was and continued in formation north.  These two aircraft in formation had an audible jet noise, solid white wing tip lights and blinking red central fuselage lights.   I am no expert on aircraft but they appeared to be F-16's. I have also never seen any aircraft flying in formation in this area before.;41.4661;-75.5952
