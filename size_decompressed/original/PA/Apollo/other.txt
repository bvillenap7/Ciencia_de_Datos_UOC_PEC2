I looked to the North north west and noticed an object 20 to 30ft above the trees. I at first thought that I was watching a large hawk gliding, but then realize the object was much larger 20-30 feet in diameter shaped like a disc with the sides curved downward as a wing would be. The object was darker (medium brown) on top and white or silver underneath. The object fluttered side to side, like a kite would, and it moved slowly north toward Apollo. It did not change altitude. I lost site of the object after about 20 seconds.;40.5565;-79.5772
Unknown craft over Western PA;2008-04-10 21:10:00;1 minute;Unknown craft over Western PA Witnessed a large, low altitude (around 3000ft) craft moving  ESE to WNW. The craft appeared to be 2 inches at arm length and a loud, jet type exaust sound was heard.  I noticed a strange array of steady white lights in a triangular shape with a red flashing light in the center. Additionally two additional white lights were centered long ways in front of the first triangular set of lights.  The craft appeared to have a long, wide fuselage with small triangular wings. The shape was similar to Boeing or Martin Space Plane.  The craft continued to gain altitude until out of site.;40.5565;-79.5772
