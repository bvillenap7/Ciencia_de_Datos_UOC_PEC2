I was at a star gazing party at my local park, and as I was looking up at the stars and planets, I saw a cone shaped craft flying through the sky.  It was striped.  The colors where bright orange and silver.  It did NOT burn up like a shooting star, it was moving in a straight direction.   After 6 or 7 minutes it spun around a few times then vanished into thin air.;40.5565;-79.5772
