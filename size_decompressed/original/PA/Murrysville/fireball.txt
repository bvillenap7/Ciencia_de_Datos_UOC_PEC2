On my way headed home from work I spotted a green fireball descending from above.  I was on Route 22 heading east down a hill before passing the Wendyâ€™s on my right.  It looked like it was a green flair being dropped and then quickly fizzled out.  The thing that distinguished it from a flair was the speed it was falling and the size. In short, the object was flickering and disappeared behind the hills. This is the second I have seen in this area.  The other was at some point last year, about same time and further down the road.;40.4467;-79.6842
