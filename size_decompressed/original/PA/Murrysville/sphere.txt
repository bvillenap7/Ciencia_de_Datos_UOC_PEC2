Red-orange spheres flying over Murrysville, PA valley and PA Turnpike.;2013-06-08 21:45:00;5 minutes;Red-orange spheres flying over Murrysville, PA valley and PA Turnpike. Observed in the evening sky were six (6) red-orange lights spaced about a mile apart from each other over the Murrysville, PA valley area.  I live in the Level Green, Penn Twp area.  My front porch faces north towards Cheswick, PA. which is across the Allegheny River at 11.40 miles.  The lights appeared to come out of the north eastern sky over what would be Plum-Monroeville, PA about 3.54 miles over the tree tops.  They flew towards my house and angled to the right over the valley and all disappeared one by one in the same place over the PA Turnpike.  They were observed for five (5) minutes.  Then another one appeared over the same area but flew perhaps, 2 miles further and disappeared over the Lyons Trail Court area.  No sound made.;40.4467;-79.6842
