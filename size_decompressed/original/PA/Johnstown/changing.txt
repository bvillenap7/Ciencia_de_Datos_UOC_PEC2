I called for my boyfriend so he could confirm what I was seeing.  The object moved from 1 part of the sky to the other multiple times.  Quicker than we could blink. We then pulled out our phone and started recording it.  The object while on video went from a solid to a gaseous state.  The object is still out there at 1:56 a.m.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
