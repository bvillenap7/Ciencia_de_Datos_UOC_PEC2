I happen to look right above my house at about a thousand feet or so , i noticed this big object.  I was kinda of in shock cause i didn't know what it was , then i told my daughter and her boyfriend to look above the house in the sky and we were speechless,and couldn't believe our eyes.  It was not an airplane, it had no lights on it, no engine noise.  It just was gliding very slowly, it was gray in color and very big, as it passed our house it just made it's way into the sky as if it disappeared.  My daghter called her son who was walking his girlfriend home, and went to pick him up cause she was scared for his safety .;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
