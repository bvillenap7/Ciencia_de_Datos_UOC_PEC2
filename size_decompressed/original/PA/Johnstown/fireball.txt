Flaming Fireball floats across night sky;2013-06-13 20:30:00;10 minutes;Flaming Fireball floats across night sky 	I am submitting this report from Johnstown Pennsylvania, approx. 1 hour and 30 min northeast of Pittsburgh in the laurel highlands region.  While listening to coast to coast am I was informed that there have been numerous sightings of strange floating and streaking fireballs in the sky across the US, and was stunned by this fact, as my family and I witnessed these strange objects in the evening sky three times. 	The first event took place on June 13 at approx. 8:30 pm.  My family and I were driving to our house which is located on one of the very high mountain peaks of the region when my step-Father pointed out a strange floating orange object in the dark evening sky. We were all instantly awestruck as to what this object could have been.  We stopped the car dead on the road and continued to inspect the object in disbelief.  It looked to be anywhere from 1000 to 1500 ft. in the air, and slowly floating in the opposite direction of the wind and cloud movement. It closely resembled a hot air balloon that had caught on fire and had no basket attached to it.  The object was very large, entirely too big to be a Chinese lantern or any other ceremonial object.  The strangest thing about the event is that the object was floating straight across the sky not up or down and was far below cloud cover and this very large flaming ball simply disappeared right in front of our eyes.  That very same nigh! t and approx. 10:30 pm my wife and I were driving home from our parentsâ€™ house and once again witnessed this strange object in the jet black night sky.  This was not the last of the occurrences however, three days later on Sunday June 16th we yet again witnessed this event take place at approx. 9: 30 pm. 	Although I have spent countless hours researching what these fireballs could have been I am left with nothing but the fact that this has taken place all over the US and possibly the world.  I am a Veteran and had spent 4 years stationed on an airbase and have been in multiple combat zones and have never witnessed anything similar to this. My only conclusion is that it is supernatural or extraterrestrial.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347

It had a smaller orb circling it like it was orbiting around the craft.  It turned completely black like it was cloaking itself.  Another black craft met with it and they sped off into the mountains.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
