Stationary light over ridge top, more appear then move away.;2012-03-18 00:30:00;01:30;Stationary light over ridge top, more appear then move away Decided to look at the stars tonight, out on my buddy’s roof.  We climbed up just looking at the stars for a while, our eyes adjusted.  At about 12:15 I looked out to the Northwest, and noticed a single bright light, and signaled my buddy to look at it…I had seen the same thing several months before.  A single bright, slightly off white, somewhat yellowed circular light hanging stationary above the ridge.  We pretty much stared at it for a good 10-20 minutes, and it faded to a point, then blinked out. Ten minutes later, we noticed it had come back in the same exact position – it remained there, slightly brighter, before blinking completely out instantly, not fading, just completely going dark, several seconds later it faded back, then flashed out completely.  Another few minutes passed without any event, then one light came into existence, slightly smaller than the original, but just to the left of the position of the original light, shortly after, a light of the original intensity came back, in the same exact position it had been the entire time. Then they both flickered out, then back once – they’d moved in a Northwardly direction- right of their original positions.  They blinked out again, and reappeared slightly more to the right.  The third time they reappeared, they didn’t blink off again, sliding slowly to the right, and down toward the ridge, behind a cell tower, before disappearing completely. For reference: We’re both freshman at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown.  I, a Geology major, and he, in civil engineering.  We were completely sober during this even.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
Fireball like object across Cambria county in Pennsylvania, US.;2012-07-07 22:50:00;7 minutes;Fireball like object across Cambria county in Pennsylvania, US. Single notably bright 'fireball' like circular/ball object through sky traveling from roughly directly west to directly east (give/take a few degrees), deep red center with white bordering light radius. Effectively caused a slight glow or haze (aura?) around its main mass as it moved almost as if it was entering atmosphere or just moving fast at high altitude (No clouds in the sky for reflection that I could see, was a star filled night)  There was some form of plane/airliner as well in the sky at a normal elevation I would guess near the object, yet the glow and 'size' of the object was effectively at least 7x larger and more notable)  Thought it might just be some form of shooting star or debris until it made 4 roughly 90 degree looking movements, once to the south, then east, then north again, then continuing eastwards. Was -no- sound from it, could not hear anything from the sky at all (no sounds of any planes/jets/etc)  Could not see any changes/deviations of the light on the object, it stayed pure red at the center with it's white radius and the faint light/haze around it just flickered lightly as it moved straight across. Lasted roughly 7 minutes, from one mountain side to the other (middle of a large valley town).;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
Saw three large red orbs moving slowly above Johnstown that simply disappeared after changed colors a few times.;2014-07-09 21:30:00;30 seconds;Saw three large red orbs moving slowly above Johnstown that simply disappeared after changed colors a few times. Originally saw one craft above Roxbury Park.  It was large, bright red, round and moving slowly.  It changed to white, light orange, red and white again. It seemed to shrink in size then just disappeared.   As we drove approximately a half mile to Shady Lane we witnessed two more moving together.  Again bright red large circles.  They moved together very slowly, changed colors, then slowly dissipated.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
