Orange glowing orb or sphere hovering above the tree line.;2012-05-19 22:30:00;5 min;Orange glowing orb or sphere hovering above the tree line. We saw an orange glowing  sphere rise above the tree line, it seemed to be flickering as if there was some kind of flame. It hovered and moved vertically at first then started to rise very fast straight up until no longer visible.   I have never seen anything like it and I am glad that there was more witnesses than me because no one would have ever believed me.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347

At approximately 11:00 pm, on June 1st, a group of three (sober) people witnessed 2 unidentified glowing orange crafts slowly rising out of the horizon.   Trajectory of the craft was highly unusual slowly moved into the sky going from right to left, then stopped for a moment, moving slowly.   Light then went out, but object was still visible, with an orb-like aura escaping it.   Object then moved upward very fast, and shot out of site instantaneously.   We observed two ufo's within minutes of each other doing precisely the same.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
