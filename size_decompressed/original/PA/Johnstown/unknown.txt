Overhead, he and I picked up on at least 4 red/gold (perhaps orange) lit-up anomalies in the sky.  They all appeared to be traveling in the same direction at set intervals, soaring by.  It struck us both as unusual.   I jokingly said that perhaps it was North Korean/Chinese/USSR airplanes a scouting party... to prepare for an invasion.  He came up with something a little more realistic, perhaps they were memorial balloons, adrift in the night sky, honoring veterans or otherwise on Independence Day.   Regardless, they appeared alien.  We see airplanes in the sky at night, most a lot higher than others.  However, you know they're US planes with their red/blue lights... these were wholly different and there was a few of them.  Worthy of alarm, at least in my opinion.  I'm near-sighted, so, needless to say I couldn't see them as well as my brother, but, they were assuredly lit up and in red/gold or yellow-orange.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
Stationary object wth red and white blinking lights in the night time sky;2019-07-21 00:35:00;10 minutes;Stationary object wth red and white blinking lights in the night time sky At approximately 0035 hours, I went into my bathroom at home and did not turn the light on. I looked outside of the window and noticed to be what I thought a jet plane flying from West to East. It appeared to be flying at the same speed and altitude as a jet plane would normally fly. I thought nothing of it. It had blinking red and white lights on it, also typical of what a jet plane looked like in the night sky. About a minute or 2 later, I looked up in the sky again.  Right where I had just seen the “jet plane” flying, looked to be the same craft I had just seen.  Only this time, it wasn’t moving. I stood there looking out the window and up into the sky for the next 10 minutes. The craft did not move at all. It was totally still with the same blinking red and white lights. I thought that maybe it was a helicopter, but they do not usually fly that high up in the air.  I had to get up fairly early today, so I quit watching and went to bed. For some reason, this has really been bothering me all day. I would like to add that I was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs when this sighting occurred.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
