White light in night sky viewed for 15 minutes, traveled N to W and reversed it path;2002-11-20 20:50:00;15 Minutes;White light in night sky viewed for 15 minutes, traveled N to W and reversed it path At approximately 8:50PM EST I was outside putting things away for my neighbor who injured his back. I looked into the Northern part of the sky and saw a small, white dot in the sky moving rather slowly no flashing of lights, no colored lights, no cascading of any kind. This was a couple miles away, there were no sounds. It was traveling from the North where I first saw it to the West, towards Johnstown, PA. It seemed to mostly stay at the same speed but at varoius times it did decelerate when its speed increased it was where it left off no faster. It also kept it's original level flightline moving from my right to left. I was looking at it through binoculars and was moving laterally with it. About half way through this it either stopped or was now moving directly away from me. In my opinion it stopped because it didn't become smaller and harder to see. There was intermitent clouds but all in all it was clear and cool with a full moon. After it stopped it started to move back to where it was coming from the North. The speed seemed a little more accelerated at this point. Again same level flightpath. I kept viewing it while continuously moving to my left to get a better view. I also had to do this because it was going behind some large trees in my neighbors yard. I then lost total site of it but at that moment two other lights appeard where it seemed to stop one headed west one north. I stayed with the westward one because it was easier to view. This did flash white and red and could have been a plane. Whether or not it was something this object ejected or a plane I do not know. This isn't the first time I encountered strange things in the sky over the years. I have had 3 seperate encounters that makes this fourth one seem like nothing!;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
White light appeared as a star, just dimmed out.;2004-05-28 22:44:00;5 SEC (APPROX);White light appeared as a star, just dimmed out. I am a police officer with 24 years experience and also an avaition enthusiast.   On 5/28/04 at 2244 hours, I was leaving my residence for the 11x7 shift.  As I approached my vehicle I looked up at the sky to see what kind of a night (weatherwise) I was in for.   Clouds were broken at 2400 and the temp. was 59 degrees.  As I looked up at the moon in the west, I noticed there was a planet (which one?) at the moons 5 o'clock, and two stars all more or less in a direct line.  Then I noticed the middle star was moving north at a fairly high speed. When I first saw it, it was just slightly dimmer than the planet and brighter than the closest star.  As the unknown continued north, it grew dimmer and dimmer at a steady rate until it just went out all together.  There were no navigation lights visable after the white light went out, there was no sound either.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
One bright light 2 times brighter than any planet or star in the sky was following a commercial airliner in an east-northeast path;2008-07-18 21:50:00;10 min;One bright light 2 times brighter than any planet or star in the sky was following a commercial airliner in an east-northeast path across the cloudless sky.  The object stayed behind (about 1 mile) and to the right or south of the airliner.  The object was so bright, that after the airliner disappeared in the horizon, the object could still be seen.  I have seen this same object in 1960, 1984 and now in 2008.  The previous objects made a low humming sound as they passed overhead.  This object did not pass overhead, it was to the south of my position, and so I don't know if it made the same sound or not.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
Bright light spotted in sky;2009-03-24 06:00:00;10-15 mins;Bright light spotted in sky I was awaken just after 6AM, and looked out the sliding glass doors, presumably facing east. A bright light in the sky caught my eye, which at first looked like a regular star, but it was awfully bright and it would flash every 10-15 seconds. It was already starting to turn daylight at the time of this sighting, plus I can't recall seeing any clouds (it was mostly clear all night long with distant visibility) that might've hindered this light. I shall add that there were trees outside, but quickly concluded that the trees were not causing the flashing, as I witnessed this light flashing without the branches blocking the view.  To clarify location of sighting, it is located about 7 miles north of Johnstown and about a mile south of U.S. Route 22. There is also a small airport about 10 miles southeast, but I doubt it was a plane, the light was stationary too long.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
Bright Orange (oval shaped) object over Johnstown PA flys for short period then remains stationary in sky for over 30+min;2010-05-26 22:00:00;30 minutes;Bright, orange (oval shaped) object over Johnstown, PA, flys for short period then remains stationary in sky for over 30+min On Monday May 26, 2010,  my girlfriend and two children ( my oldest being 6 and youngest 2) decided to go get ice cream at a local creamery ,located at Roxbury park, in a section of Johnstown known as Roxbury.  After we got ice cream we proceeded to sit at some benches at the perimeter of the park and eat each of our ice cream desserts there. As we were beginning to eat the dessert My daughter (age 6) asked me , “what is that light in the sky Papa?” I took a look in the direction that she was pointing and noticed a very bright object approaching from a distance (It came from the direction of Westmont, another suburb of Johnstown) towards the direction where we were standing. (Note: The four of us were not the only ones out at this time of night.  There was another family, eating their ice cream desserts beside us as well. They did not seem to be paying attention to what we were looking at)  My initial answer to my daughter’s question was that the object was a helicopter, possibly with a spotlight on. I mentioned the spotlight, as the light the object was emitting was extremely bright, orange, and looked like what you would see, if looking at a spotlight head from a distance. I stated to her that the helicopter was probably coming in for a landing at the local hospital (Conemaugh hospital). As I continued to observe the object, it came to a gradual stop. (Note: as it approached our location, it did not “fly” very fast at all, which led me to believe it was a helicopter)  We continued to watch the object and as time past, I came to the realization that it was not a conventional aircraft. The object remained stationary for a period of 30 minutes or more. (The length of time we were at the location eating our ice cream). I became perplexed as to what this object could be.  It was a pretty clear night, and many stars were visible.  This object however was in our atmosphere, much brighter then even the north star, or planet such as Venus, and after having seen it move initially, it remained stationary for an extended period of time. My girlfriend mentioned at some point during this event, that there was in fact quite a bit of  “aerial” activity in the vicinity of this object.  We both notice several smaller aircraft flying in what I call an observation flight path at various locations in the sky near to each other and in the direction of the object. I will say that after looking at the smaller aircraft for some time, and following their flight paths, At least one of the aircraft came to complete stop mid air and seemed to be observing the object that I am reporting on.  The smaller aircraft looked to be a “conventional aircraft”, as it had both white and red blinking lights. The only abnormal behavior that this small aircraft exhibited was the “hovering” maneuver it was able to do when “observing” the bright object. I will mention that I was able to take some photographs and video footage of this event with my smart phone.  As you may already know, the quality of this media is not very good. I also do not have flash on the camera, which definitely did not help my cause in attempting to capture good footage for the purpose of evidence. You are welcome to this footage if you so desire. After at least 30 minutes of observing the object, I packed the family in the car and took them home.  After being home for about 20 minutes, I decided I needed to go back to the location where I saw the object and ensure that what I saw was indeed not a star or planet.  When I arrived at the exact location I had initially seen the object, it was no longer there.  There was no aerial traffic either. The skies remained clear of clouds, allowing me to see the stars. This object was most definitely not a star or planet.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
Indigo/blue bright light hovering above mountain for 3 or 4 min. could not see source of light, too bright.;2011-12-07 23:30:00;4 min;Indigo/blue bright light hovering above mountain for 3 or 4 min. could not see source of light, too bright. Indigo/blue bright light hovering above mountain for about 4 min. could not see source of light, too bright about the size of a half of football field.  This was behind my house. I managed to take a pic when it was leaving and lights in neighborhood went out. I can only send via text email me and I will send text back with photo.

Dull orange, non-blinking, light appearing in Northeast sky and then moving slowly until disappearing.;2015-07-04 22:30:00;10 minutes;Dull orange, non-blinking, light appearing in Northeast sky and then moving slowly until disappearing. Nearly every Sunday, and on some other days less regularly, a dull orange, non-pulsating, light appears in the Northeast sky over Johnstown, PA.  It appears suddenly and usually is fairly high in the sky when it appears.  It moves slowly but generally predictably from Northeast to Southeast.  Its movements are not consistent with any kind of aircraft and there are never any green or red blinking lights observed.  It traces an irregular path and will, after 5-10 minutes, start to fade out and then reappear.  It has also appeared, although much less often, in the Northwest sky.  But when it does it follows the same pattern.  It appears almost always between 2200 and 2230 hours on Sunday evenings.  But it has appeared at some other times as well.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
