Since the actual date of any UFO sighting is of particular interest and value in any report, is there any possibility you could remember the exact date of the incident?  For example, you mention that you were cleaning up after a party.  Would you have any record, e.g. diaries, receipts, cancelled checks for party supplies, etc., that might help you pin down the exact date. If you can, would you please take a few minutes to resubmit the report, but using the Online Report Form which is found on our website.  In that format, the report can be downloaded to our database without having to retype it, and we can post the report (anonymously) to our website for others to enjoy. Again, thank you very much for having shared the information with our Center!  We receive many past reports which are reminiscent of yours.  It sounds to me as if you witnessed something very interesting on that evening! Cordially, Peter Davenport         -- Peter B.

As we drove along, I noticed something flying over the mountain ridge in front of us, about 1 mile away.  The craft had two red lights on either side, with a bright white light in the middle.  As it came closer, I noticed that it was moving quickly and taking strange angles.  At one point, it was completly on it's side, and I asked my friend what it was.  We both agreed that it was not an airplane or a helocopter.  I then asked my friend to pull over so I could get out of the car for a better look.  By the time I got out of the car and to the side of the road, it was directly above me.  At this point, there were no lights, but I could see it's outline against the night sky.  It was about 400 feet above me, and moving very slowly.  It was silent, and about as big as a football field.  It was triangular in shape, with rounded edges.  As I looked up, I could see a strange pattern of rectangles on the bottom of the craft.  I stood there in amazement, just staring at it.  I watched it for about 45 seconds move slowly away from me, until it disappeared over the horizon.  for unknown reasons, my friend never got out of the car.  Even stranger, I never discussed it with him.  I just got in the car, and we went on our way.  for some reason, even though I've seen my friend many times since this happens, I always forget to ask him about it.  I have never seen anyting like it since then, but I have heard descriptions of similar sightings.  I know this thing exists, and I will spend the rest of life hoping to see it again.  I tell my wife all the time that sooner or later, she will see it too.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347

3 Glowing orbs in triangle formation johnstown, PA;2012-07-17 21:50:00;1-2 minutes;3 Glowing orbs in triangle formation johnstown, PA At approximately 21:50 pm on July 17th 2012 three objects in a Triangle formation rose up over the top of the mountain between the Galleria Mall and Johnstown, PA.  The objects at first were very intense in color.  There were 2 orange orbs and one red orb.   At first the objects seemed like they were all one massive entity.  They were rotating in a clockwise direction and I would estimate the object to have been somewhere around 500 feet across. As the object got well about the top of the mountain it started to move in a northerly direction. Not long after it began to move north is when I began to notice the object was actually 3 smaller objects flying in formation because they began to split up and moved from a triangle formation to a straight line. They were about 500 feet apart in a straight line and as this happened the lights started to get dim and for about 30 seconds they would disappear and reappear but only dimly until they finally vanished.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
Fire flying through the sky.;2015-07-17 00:00:00;4 minutes;fire flying through the sky I was watching one ufo that looked like a little white light in the sky above me fly in a westwordly direction when a triangle shaped fire flew by going north i watched this object even got it on video it did not seem to change shape or size just kept getting further away and after another 2-3 minutes it did what i seen many ufos do and thats get small enough to the point where it vanishes.   After that i tryed looking for the first ufo but it was gone too.  If that was a ufo it would explain why the white lights become red sometimes maybe they manipulate fire to help them fly like they can change from a white flame to a red or amber type color i just wish i knew what these things were.;40.3065358695652;-78.9205891304347
