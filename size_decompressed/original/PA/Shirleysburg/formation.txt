I was in my home in rural Shirleysburg, PA.   It was sometime in the evening after dark when I heard a noise outside.   I opened the door to my front porch to see what it was.  My neighbor had stopped to get her mail from her mailbox.  It was then that I noticed rapidly blinking colored lights in the southern sky.  I thought perhaps it was a satellite.  Very strange, I had never seen a satellite do this.  I called to my daughter to come and see.  Shortly afterwards,  5 UFO crafts flew directly overhead at treetop level.  Each craft had 4 spherical shaped bright yellowish glowing lights underneath in a V shaped pattern. The front two of the lights were closer together than the back two.  You could not hear any sound from the crafts as they few over.   Soon thereafter the air force chased after them.   They were quite noisy.
