I saw lights in the distance (red and yellow flashing) which would have looked like an airplane except that as I watched them they moved up then down and side to side. When my husband came in I made him watch with me. It disapeared for a second then when it started again it basically did the same thing then sat in the same place for a short time. Suddenly it shot straight up, much higher than it had gone before (so I was sure it wasn't a helicopter) and disapeared. The description above is pretty much all there is.
