Cigar shaped,lighted object.;1992-08-15 22:30:00;10-15 seconds;Cigar shaped,lighted object. A few friends and I were hanging out one night on the railroad tracks when something along the horizon caught our attention.It appeared at first,to be just hovering.We could see two bright lights,and some sort of oval shape between them.Now,if you're standing with your arm extended in front of you towards the sky,and held your thumb and forefinger about 3 inches apart,that's how far apart the lights appeared .I can't give an approximate size,other then to say it was big.The lights were nearly as bright as the full moon.Anyway,it hovered for about a second.Also,there was planes approaching this object from the east.We noticed two of em as the flew directly overhead of us.As quick as we saw this object,it shot off to the south  and out of view.We thought it was gone.Then,within seconds,it came flying back into view,to the same spot(or fairly close)it was.There it hovered for a few seconds,then shot off to the north at a fast speed till it was totally out of sight.We watched for about another hour,thinking it might come back.It never did.I can't say for sure it was extraterrestrial.But,it certainly wasn't a plane.It was moving way to fast,and  the lights were too bright.I've always wondered what the hell it was.There was no sound at all.I would think something man made,that was that big,would make some noise,as did the planes flying overhead.
