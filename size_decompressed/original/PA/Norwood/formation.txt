18 Bright fast Pearl like UFOs in group between  Philadelphia & Delawre crossed I-95;1996-05-11 17:00:00;2 minutes;18 Bright fast Pearl like UFOs in group between  Philadelphia & Delawre crossed I-95 They were a ultra-bright circle or point of pure white light looking roughly 2 mm at a great altitude between and behind the clouds. Bright enough to easily see threw the clouds. They had no real formation more like a mob going in same direction from the Delaware river direction in broad ark going West. against a strong wind, with one trailing slightly behind the others going extremely fast from horizon to horizon. I had time to spot them, point and yell (did not see anyone else) for about 10 seconds before they were behind the 3 floor tall Victoria twin houses with high pointed roofs roughly 4 doors away from me on the sidewalk. Then I ran that distance to my house into the back yard in time to see them from behind briefly. They were still in a broad  arc but the direction  was changing more to the North.  Norwood is  South of Philadelphia PA. about half way to the  Delaware state line off  I 95. I have been watching the sky often for 30 years and have never seen anything close to this except in old VHS video taken in Mexico in 90's  the UFOs were called Pearls or string of pearls. They looked almost exactly the same. I will probably remember this clearly forever. but they were so high and fast I don't think anyone else in my general area got a good look due to narrow streets in this urban/suburban area with 3 and 4 story buildings everyplace.;39.8823;-75.2894
