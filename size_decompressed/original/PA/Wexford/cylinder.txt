What ever it was it was not from this world.;2003-11-04 17:20:00;10 minutes;What ever it was it was not from this world. I saw UFO traveling from Southeast to Northeast direction. It glowed yellowish orange and was cylinderical in shape. I ruled out a airplane because there was no exhaust plume behind it. I ruled out a meteorite because they way it was traveling and because there would of been a trail of light behind it. It did not come down but went across the sky. I watched it for about ten or so minutes until it disappeared.;40.6124;-80.064
Bright orange cylinder spiraled in sky;2013-11-20 21:57:00;15 seconds;Bright orange cylinder spiraled in sky Driving along wexford bayne rd on the way to a store my boyfriend, and I looked up and saw extremely bright orange cylinder shape spiral in the sky for about 15 seconds, and then disappear.    I've never seen anything like it in my life while looking at the stars.  It wasn't a street light.  It was in the sky and it was so bright.   We both work all the time and had the day off today so we have been out and about doing different things and then out of nowhere we saw this thing appear and disappear in a matter of moments.;40.6124;-80.064
