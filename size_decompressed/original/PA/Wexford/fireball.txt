My husband got home from work at approximately 9:55pm.  He saw some strange lights in the sky from our front yard.  He said they were like orange fire balls in the sky and in a straight line.  There were 8-10 lined up.  He didn't think they were moving at first, but as he stood still watching them, he could tell they were moving very slowly eastward.  There was no sound made by them. He watched them for about 5 minutes, when he came inside to get me so I could see them.  Only a minute had passed before I got outside, and the lights were gone.;40.6124;-80.064
2 adults and 1 child saw dark orange/reddish round &quotfireball&quot traveling across sky, moving from South to North above McKnight;2014-09-05 23:24:00;2 minutes;2 adults and 1 child saw dark orange/reddish round &quotfireball&quot traveling across sky, moving from South to North above McKnight 2 adults and 1 child saw dark orange/reddish round fireball traveling across sky, moving from South to North above McKnight Rd. at approximately 11:30 pm. No sound heard. Did not flash or anything like that. It maintained a steady speed and even/equal brightness for around 2 minutes, then light dimmed (briefly) and then returned to original level of brightness, disappeared quickly traveling North. Seemed to have smokey ring around it. I haven't seen anything like it before. Very interesting. Tried to record a video clip but object wouldn't show up on video however a still image was taken and is somewhat visible. Would love to know what we saw! Comet? Meteor? UFO?;40.6124;-80.064
