Large, wingless ship hovers over university building.;1995-03-29 06:30:00;3 minutes;Large, wingless ship hovers over university building. In 1995 I was a freshman at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania.  I had stayed in the computer lab late into the morning on Wednesday, March 29, as this day was University Day and we did not have class.   I exited Franklin Science Center from the inside corner of this L-shaped building around 6:30 in the morning and started walking across the lawn back to my dorm.  I was halfway across the lawn when I looked up and saw a ship hovering above the Dauphin Humanities building, maybe 4 or 5 stories high.  It was not a plane, or a helicopter or any other aircraft that I have ever seen before.  It was large and rather drum shaped with big round lights around it.   This ship just hovered there, and I don't remember any sound coming from it.  I was terrified and just froze in place and stared at it for probably a minute or two.  The sky was clear and bright and there was just this odd ship hanging in the air!  It did not have wings or propellors or any other visible device to keep it in the air.   I don't know how long I would have stood there staring at it, but it started to move foward in my direction, again completely silent, and this was when I started back pedalling back to Franklin Science Center.  Once I got inside the building I did not go back outside for 2 hours until other people were around.  When I looked at the same spot over Dauphin Humanities there was nothing there.  I felt like I was looking at a picture and someone had just erased the ship and there was a big blank spot in the sky where it had been.   I never heard any reports about this on the news and I myself never reported it to any officials.
