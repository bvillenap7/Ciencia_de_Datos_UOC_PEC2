My and my friend were looking at the moon through our telescope on his porch, but then something darted in front of it, he asked me what it was, I took a look, but I wasn't sure, so I took some pictures of it using a old camera, sadly, when I had the film developed, there was just a huge ball of light, then we saw it dissapear into the darkness, I then saw this site so I logged on today and subbmitted this TRUE report to you all ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to get the other witness, a student, to submit a report, as well.
