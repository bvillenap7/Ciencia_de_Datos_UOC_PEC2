Could not be a star clouds behind it It was hard to tell how high in the sky it was but it was just a little bigger then a star and it was and orange amber like color. It was moving slowly like a slow plane but it only glowed not blink. It was two slow to be a plane and it was in front of the clouds. It lasted about 5-7 min when i looked back to see where my dog was and when i looked again it was gone. I waited about another 5 minutes to see if i just looked in the wrong place and it was no where in sight. It moved what looked like halfway acrossed the sky but very slowly.There were no sound and I did notice other planes further away that did not look anything like this.

I called my roommate so she could see it. When she finally saw it we decided to go outside with the camara but by the time we got out there it was gone.;40.0537;-77.5216
