I saw a large, very bright steady light, that was orange and red.  It moved slowly and steady across the sky like a satellite would move, but it was low and large, about 500 ft off the ground.  It did not flicker or flash.   It moved in a straight line from South to North until it was out of sight over the horizon.  It was basically a sphere, with a haze around it.  The color was beautiful shades of bright orange and red. There were no stars in the sky, as it was overcast.  It was totally silent.;41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335

They started a sizeable distance apart from one another, almost caught up but both became stationary, not moving then changed course flickering and shrinking out of sight.

It was too fast to be a Chinese lantern and too slow to be a meteor.  Quite a sight, it looked like a flame, morphing the way flames do in the wind. Based on the location I'm sure hundreds of other people saw it, just a matter of time before someone else reports this as well.  Just wanted to document the sighting.;41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335
