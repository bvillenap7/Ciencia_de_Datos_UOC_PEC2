Box shape, Large green and silent.;1984-06-19 11:00:00;10 - 15 minutes;Box shape, Large green and silent. Before starting work at the Wyoming Valley Mall when I observed a large box-shaped craft moving from south to north. It made no noise and cruised at a slow but steady rate. It wasn't all that high and I could see it quite clearly unitil it flew out of site.  It was a green rectangular box with a what appeared to be a red dome on top. It looked sloped on the side of the direction it moved in. No windows or doors. It stuck me as very angular and similar to a very large garbage dumpster turned upside down. I watched it in silence for a at least 5 minutes before running inside and finding another cook.  He came outside and his reaction was: What the hell it that!  We both watched until we could no longer see it, scrathed our heads and went back to work. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

Flashing lights Red/Orange and White/grey bouncing  gaining and losing altitude instantly.;2013-10-24 20:50:00;6 minutes;Flashing lights Red/Orange and White/grey bouncing  gaining and losing altitude instantly. We were standing on the front porch of the house looking northeast towards Wilkes-Barre and a Light roughly the size of a half dollar appeared out of nowhere over the valley.  (We are about 15 miles southwest of Wilkes-Barre)  The light seemed to shift between a Red/Orange to a white almost grey color.  Whatever it was moved very quickly.  It dropped altitude very rapidly and hovered just above a cloud that seemed suspended over the valley.  While it was close to the cloud, the cloud had kind of, dim rolling flashes inside the very top of it when the object would momentarily approach it.  It continued to bounce very quickly gaining and losing altitude, dipping vertically in and out of this cloud.  Every so often it would do a circular motion on the way up or down.  Then it shot up to about half the average altitude for the event and almost instantly and zipped off toward the northeast. We're house sitting for a family member who lives in the country, we were outside admiring the sky,  which we do often.  We are familiar with normal celestial objects and aircraft.  Our primary residence is less than 1/8 of a mile from the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport, where I attended ground school for my private pilots license during high school.   Both my girlfriend and I are very familiar with what is normal.  This was not normal. I'm not sure what to call what we witnessed.;41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335
