I decide to go out for a little walk to stretch my legs at about 21:30 (9:30pm). As I was walking west on the enterance road I happened to look up and saw a ball of light come out from behind a building to my right. This ball of light was a very bright white and was approximately 1 mile to the northwest of me about 300 feet in the air, possibly a little higher. The ball of light was traveling from the north to the south at a speed I would estimate at about 200-250 miles per hour. As the ball of light was approaching the centre city area, it all of a sudden did what I think to be a 90 degree turn and go straight up into the air for about 200-300 feet. This ball of light hovered for a second in one position and then came back down to its previous position and proceeded back off to the north towards Scranton, PA. By the time I got to where I can look to the north, the ball of light was gone and never saw it again. What I found very surprising is that the ball of light took the same track out that it came in on. There was no noise with this ball of light. It was just a ball of white light, no other colors in with it. There was no streak or trail behind it. I am not aware of anything in the world that can do such a perfect maneuver without some variation off of its track. I would estimate the size of this object to be like extending your arm and holding a little rubber super ball or a quarter in the air. I asked around to other people I was working with that night, if they saw anything but they said no. I know I was not seeing things. Some people say maybe your mind was playing tricks on you but I don't think that is it. Like I said, it was pretty early in the evening about 2130 hrs. There had to be other witnesses to this.;41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335

Large light seen directly under moon;2007-12-15 05:00:00;5-10 minutes;Large light seen directly under moon After learning of this site I decided I would report something I saw sometime in December of 2007.I was skeptical of reporting such a thing but it has been bothering me ever since. The object seemed to be almost directly below the moon and was much brighter and larger than any star I’ve seen. Approximate timing of the event was early in the morning around 5am or so. I can tell you myself I am a skeptic but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to report this. As I watched the object for about 10 minutes it never moved from that spot but continually every minute or so would dime very slowly to almost nothing and then begin to brighten to the exact size once again. I admit to you that I got scared so I decided to stop watching what I was seeing  out of disbelief of the situation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Orange orb over North-East PA 30 sec;2008-08-10 23:45:00;30 sec;Orange orb over North-East PA 30 sec While sitting on the front porch watching planes fly by with their blinking lights and straight flight paths, I noticed what i thought to be a plane at first coming towards the house but still at a far distance.  One thing you should know is that our house is located about 20 min from the Wilkes-Barre Scranton airport.  I have seen the flight paths of many aircrafts and know what airports planes are coming from just by knowing the direction they are flying from.  I also notice that with all aircraft there are blinking lights on the ends of the wing tips.  Now with this said I noticed an orange orb of light coming from a completely different way altogether.  At first I heard a low rumble and was anticipating this aircraft maybe to be military. I was actually excited as military aircraft is rare over this area.  As the object grew closer i knew that it was not military what so ever.  It travelled for 25 seconds slowly in my direction and this is where it got weird. The orb reversed in the direction it came and literally darted out of site in a split second towards the stars!!!!!!!  The disturbing thing to me was the speed it reversed as it was coming so slowly towards my direction in the beginning.  I have been baffled by what I have seen and also about the United Kingdoms tabloids today, as the UK has reported a spectacular 150 sitings this year alone!  There have been more in PA recently too. There were no blinking lights on this object, it was if it was just a ball of light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Very bright stationary object observed during broad daylight.;2011-07-13 13:30:00;2 minutes;Very bright stationary object observed during broad daylight. During the afternoon of July 13th 2011, me and a friend were out taking a walk.  It was a bright sunny day with few if any clouds.  While walking I noticed a bright stationary object in the north-east sky.   The object had caught my eye because of its brightness and I stopped walking so suddenly that my friend asked what was wrong.  He then looked in the direction I was staring and noticed the same “star-like” bright yellowish object.  I had been staring because I thought it might be a jet or plane reflecting the sun.  This object was not very high in the horizon and after looking at it for a minute or so we realized it was not a jet or similar aircraft.  The object appeared about as bright as the planet Venus at night except this was in broad daylight. My friend and I could not figure out what this thing was and I thought I might be witnessing a supernova bright enough to be visible in daylight.  I even considered a Mylar or aluminum balloon but there was a significant breeze and this thing was stationary.  My friend and I continued to walk and eventually I glanced away and when I looked back the object had disappeared.  I don’t know if there were other reports on this day and time in this area but others had to see this. It should be stated that we saw other aircraft in the sky but they did not reflect or appear nearly as bright as this object and they were moving like normal aircraft do.;41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335
Circles of light rotating in two circular patterns;2012-06-25 23:30:00;15 minutes;circles of light rotating in two circular patterns Circles of light were rotating in two circular patterns, one clockwise on the right and one counter clockwise on the left.  Both patterns  met in the middle and two lights occasionally tailed off, with one light chasing after the other.  No beams of light were visible from the ground and the source was not determined.  This was witnessed by residents, a PP&L utility worker, and multiple police officers.  A resident even called this in to 911.;41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335
6 lights in (3 then 2 then 1) formation moving southeast and up into the cloud deck.;2013-02-24 18:37:00;3-5 minutes;6 lights in (3 then 2 then 1) formation moving southeast and up into the cloud deck. While outside smoking 3 of us witnessed 3 redish orange lights travelling southeast and up toward the cloud deck.  They appeared to be in formation.   Then 2 additional lights moved along the same path.    A single light followed the previous sets in the same direction.;41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335
6 total lights move across northwest-north night sky 1 at a time, 3 blue/red blink 2blue blink 1 blue solid.;2014-08-12 04:30:00;5:30;6 total lights move across northwest-north night sky 1 at a time, 3 blue/red blink 2 blue blink 1 blue solid I saw an unusually bright star (object 1) which made me take notice, it was solid blue amd stationary.  I thought there was nothing special after all, but then saw an inch away on the horizon, a set of double red lights (object 2).   I watched the red lights begin fast blinking blue, then red, and travel in a non-linear path northwest-north until out of view.  Then I saw a cut of light such as a shooting star right where I saw the light disappear, in the SW direction it came from, approx. 2-3 inch long.   The same type of light appeared a about an inch from the star, and followed a similar path until out of view, north to northwest with no change in direction (object 3).   My mother is on the computer, I tell her to come look, amd she witnesses the rest of the event.  A bright blue fast blinking light follows a similar path until out of view (object 4.)   These all happened at uneven intervals, number 4 appeared after approx. 10 minutes of nothing happening.    Another bright blue fast blinking object appears, and follows the same path as the others did (object 5.)   Then (object 1) BRIGHT blue solid light suddenly begins moving and following the same path, which shocks me, I thought it was only a star.   Once it is out of view, one more set of double red lights appears (object 6) begins blinking red and blue, and follows the same path, potentially faster.   I'd say each object took 45 seconds moving across the sky until object 1 moved, object 1 and 6 took about 30 seconds each.   Several varying minutes passed between each object appearing, object one was constant in one place until it moved, the whole time of the event.   I only had my tablet on hand and  tried to take a video, but it was too dark.;41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335
