Space Station Confusion;2009-07-07 22:55:00;4 mins;Space Station Confusion It was early July, not sure of the exact date.  I came home that night and when I walked in my grandfather said that they mentioned on the local news that we would be able to see the space station tonight at a certain time. (possibly 10:55) He said last time it was in the area it passed right over our house.  So we proceeded to walk outside, we saw my uncle and his friend were across the street waiting for it as well.  So we're waiting and waiting, watching the blinking lights of a few planes, when i see a bright white light (non-blinking) heading towards my house, I said to my grandfather there it is!..  I was instantly shot down by him saying no thats not it as he points to the south of where I was looking, it was another light, bright orange moving very fast.  This orange light seemed to be a larger light than the one I first saw, probably because it was closer.  So my grandfather, my uncle his friend and I were all fixed on the orange light, convinced this was! the space station.  When my grandfather looks to where I first pointed and it was that white light I first saw now cruising right over our house, he said then oh there it is.  We all decided that was the space station, but then moved our eyes back to the bright orange light having no clue what it could be.  My gramp was in the air force for years and he said he'd never seen anything like that, It then move out of our view over the tree/city line. The space station and the object were both moving from Southwest to Northeast. All of this occured within a few minutes, and there was no sound. The orange light was constant, not blinking or changing in appearance whatsoever. Later that month there was a news report from a town maybe 20-25 minutes Northeast of us, about a reported UFO sighting, and the report had pictures.  The pictures were of a bright orange ball.  We didn't think until we saw the news report that it could have been a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.  PD));41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335
Large, very slow-moving white/yellow sphere.;2010-06-06 22:00:00;30 seconds;Large, very slow-moving white/yellow sphere. I saw a very slow moving, large white/yellow sphere low in the southern sky, below the cloudbank.   At first I thought it was stationary, but then I realized it was slowly moving east.  It was much too large to be a planet.  It was silent.  The sky was very overcast, with no stars, moon, or planets visible.   I went in for a second to get my husband, and it was totally gone when we came back out.;41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335
