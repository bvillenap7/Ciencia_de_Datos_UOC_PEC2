perfect elongated diamond shape yellowish object;2006-08-08 04:30:00;30 SECOND;perfect elongated diamond shape yellowish object was outside at around 4:30 am having a cigarette and coffee in backyard.  At first thought it was a shooting star, see those almost everynight.  But then thought it was an airplane with a very bright light, stayed motionless and soundless.  But the light was in a shape of an elongated diamond, too perfect.  Stared at it for about 20 seconds.  Ruled out flares as daylight was starting to show up, would have seen smoke.  Airport is nearby, 20 minutes away, so airplane landing or taking off, I can hear, but this didn't hear nothing, had to be up past the clouds, when it went away, it gave off a very bright light, I could see my shadow as if someone was shining a light on me 5 feet away.  Still wondering what I saw was an actuall UFO or a satellite coming down being burnt away or a test military aircraft, either way there had to be other people besides me seeing that.  Am very curious to know what I actually saw though.;41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335
