Rectangular object with round lights in it flying low altitude at a high rate of speed over Wilkes-Barre sky's;2011-04-26 03:00:00;10 seconds;Rectangular object with round lights in it flying low altitude at a high rate of speed over Wilkes-Barre sky's On the morning of April,26,2011 about 3:00 Am  I was sitting in a park with my girlfriend near her house.  We were talking while we were looking up at the sky.  It was partly cloudy that night but u could still see a great number of stars.  As we sitting looking up a light caught my eye it was small round light coming through a cloud and it looked like there was a light behind it.  Naturally I said o look to my Girlfriend there is a shooting star.  I thought it was a low one with a bright tail behind it. She looked up and it came out of the cloud into a clearing in the sky.  What came out of that cloud was no shooting star.  It was rectangle in shape with three small round lights in a line inside the rectangle.  The lights were brighter then the rectangle part.  It wasn't very high and it kept moving in the same direction.  It was no Meteor, no satellite , no plane or jet.  It didn't even make noise when it was approaching or when i was gone like a jet does just quiet. !   I looked at her and I said, Umm, did you see that?  just to make sure and she replied,  I think we just saw a UFO I could not believe it at first but I am 100% certain this was a UFO.  I did some looking up on Google and it seems on September , 5 , 2010 there was a similar sighting of this object    Moving toward Duryea  Pennsylvania which is about 10 miles away from where are sighting happened.  My girlfriend is a strong believer of aliens,UFO's,E.T life.  I on the other hand really never took much interest or believed in aliens or any of that stuff but after this sighting it has changed my whole out look on the subject.   Also there were other jets you could see that night flying around because there is a airport about 13 miles away.  And there were other planes flying at this time.;41.2260402777778;-75.8200895833335
