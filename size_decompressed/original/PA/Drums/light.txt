The light appeared to be a shade of orange.  It seemed to be getting closer and closer until it looked like it was directly above my neighbor's house.  My window was open and I did not hear a sound come from the craft.  If it was a conventional craft it would have made some kind of an audible noise that could be heard over the strong wind that was blowing.  I observed it for approximately 15 seconds before going to get a video recorder, but when I returned to the window the craft was gone.;41.028;-75.978

I have stared out in the sky before and thought a star was moving when it was actually an illusion.  This was different.   This UFO was changing direction left, right, side to side, in circles, and sideways figure 8's.   The elevation changes both up and down were dramatic and took about 1-2 seconds.   The color resembled the color of a star but at times, appeared to be omitting a reddish tiny with every once in a while a little sparkle of blue.  I pulled my compass out from my phone and I was facing northwest at approximately 330 degrees facing northwest.   This was such a strange and unusual experience.;41.028;-75.978
