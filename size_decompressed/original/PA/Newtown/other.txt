Strange black object over Newtown, PA.;2015-05-22 17:30:00;5 minutes;Strange black object over Newtown, PA. I managed to video tape a strange black object on my way home from work.  I live near an airport and see airplanes fly overhead all the time.  This was no airplane, it moved slow as if it were surveying the area.  By the time I could pull over to get a good shot, it was way in the distance.   It was hard to define its shape, but it was dark in color.;40.2673;-74.9486999999999
