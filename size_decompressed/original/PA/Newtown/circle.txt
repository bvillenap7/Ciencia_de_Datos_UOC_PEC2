A purple circle in the sky speeds off in the distance above Newtown, PA.;2017-10-17 00:30:00;2 seconds;A purple circle in the sky speeds off in the distance above Newtown, PA. Driving home, I saw around 12:30 AM, a large, far off purple circle shaped light.  It didn't appear to be moving, but hovering.  Then, as soon as I saw it.  It seemed to speed off in a flash and disappeared in an instant.  I saw its trail of light disappear too.  It was a clear night, and there were no street lights.  I saw it from Durham Road, just leaving the Acme parking lot.;40.2673;-74.9486999999999
