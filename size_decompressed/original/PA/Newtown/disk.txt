Saucer like object flies above community pool.;2003-06-26 13:40:00;5-10 minutes;Saucer like object flies above community pool. Disc shaped object hovered near homeowners association pool which had about 20-30 swimmers, mainly made up of parents with their children.  The object appeared parallel to the ground at first, at around 10,000 feet altitude, and when it was parallel it had a cigar shape and glimmered silver and shiny.  When it departed it did not ascend or descend, but instead just floated off.  As it turned it banked and the underside was dark and allowed the viewers to see that it had a disc shape.  About 15 people were watching it closely, asking others if they had a camera or videocamera, but unfortunately noone had anticipated this so there were no cameras around.  A dark helicoptor with no markings was seen hovering and following from a distance, but it certainly kept it's distance.
