Bright UFOs seen with Chemtrails Bucks County;2009-07-21 07:45:00;25 seconds;Bright UFOs seen with Chemtrails Bucks County Hello! I wanted to at least go on record as having witnessed the following on July 21st at approximately 7:45 am (the incident only lasted about 25 seconds and I did not have a camera):   I was travelling eastbound in my car on Wrights rd in Newtown Bucks County toward the Peter Taylor farmstead where I was going to pick up produce for our farm stand.  I had noticed three parallel chemtrails high in the sky running from east to west.   Suddenly a bright light caught my eye next to the chemtrail closest to me.  At first I thought it might be an airplane with the sun reflecting off of it, but the brightness of the object and its flight path convinced me otherwise.  The object travelled alongside the one chemtrail, then shifted into it and back out.  At this time, a second object appeared (same size same brightness)  They spiraled once around the chemtrail and then quickly changed direction and seemed to disappear from sight.  It is difficult to estimate the size of the objects since they were high in the sky.   The chemtrails were fairly new since the one they were flying around was being formed at that time.(the jet was at least a half mile away from the objects.  I woul! d estimate that the diameter of the objects were approximately 1/6 to 1/8 the width of the chemtrail. I went on line the next morning to research any similar types of sightings (chemtrails with ufos).  I found several cases and therefore I wanted to add my experience to the database. If you have any questions please contact me. I am a high school teacher and I know what I saw. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We are aware that many people accept the chemtrail phenomenon as being real, but we at NUFORC are unconvinced of their existence.  Rather, we suspect that they all are simply contrails, i.e. condensation trails, behind high-altitude aircraft.  PD));40.2673;-74.9486999999999

It was a clear night and as I looked at the sky I could see the typical stars and as I'm looking up I see a light moving across the sky at a very high speed from the south to the north at a very high altitude, Based on seeing aircraft at night flying at 35,000 ft, I estimate the object was close to 100,000 ft. It covered a large part of the sky very quick.;40.2673;-74.9486999999999
