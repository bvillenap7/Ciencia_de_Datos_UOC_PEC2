I was watching a hawk fly over my head so I stood up and turned around.  Looked up to see a shiney round object gliding across the sky.  It didn't have wings like a plane, nor did it have any con-trails like most planes do.  No flashing lights.  It was so smooth moving through the sky.  It went behind a cloud and didn't reappear in it's projected path on the other side of the cloud.  It just vanished.  It was so shiney.  I was in awe over what I was watching.;41.7845;-76.3841
