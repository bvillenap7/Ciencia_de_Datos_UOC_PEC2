Fast moving, large, bright light low in the sky from East to West.  Definitely Not a plane or satellite.  The light suddenly vanished without a trace. After a minute, a long, narrow cigar-shaped cloud appeared in the same place.  It looked like a con-trail from an airplane, but it was much shorter and there were no lights.  It continued West, but moved up and down in a random pattern as it moved quickly across the sky-  I've never seen a plane move in such a way.  It also kept fading in and out- sometimes appearing substantial and sometimes appearing to be just a cloud in a cloudless sky.  Then it vanished, too.;40.0816;-75.2546
