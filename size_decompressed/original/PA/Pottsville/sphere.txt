I was outside on the porch with my girlfriend smoking a a cig and i noticed an orange light appear that wasn't there before. It looked kinda the way Mars looks at this time a year. It then started to move from the south  to north.just a little bit faster than a plane would move. It's altitude was about 15,000 feet, it had more of a glow to it, not anything like a plane.  As it passed over i waited to hear for the sound that you usually hewar after a jet goes by, but nothing. Thats not the only time i've witnessed other starange lights in the sky in this area.;40.6832;-76.2113
