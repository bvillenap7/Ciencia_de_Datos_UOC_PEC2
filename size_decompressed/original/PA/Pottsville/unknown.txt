fast moving object stopped 6 cars after flying overhead;2011-05-11 10:05:00;3 minutes;fast moving object stopped 6 cars after flying overhead At 10:05 AM on may 11, 2011, traveling north on rt. 61 outside of Pottsville Pennsylvania and object flashed over head so fast you couldn’t see anything but a blur and its shadow for a mere second before it was beyond the trees, immediately after it flew overhead, the first few cars ahead swerved out of control and  all the other cars behind them including me came to a stop behind them, after stopping I noticed when I tried to accelerate  not only was my car shut off but the GPS unit and my cell phone was dead as well. I stepped out of my vehicle along with 5 others that were driving along the same road to see if everyone was ok and report the incident, but all of our electronics were still out for 3 full minutes.  No cars were wrecked but we were all very shaken up, I talked with the other drivers that also said they didn’t see what the flying object was but it startled them and cut out their electronics as well   After the 3 minutes you began to hear cell phones turning back on and our cars were able to start back up we got into our vehicles and continued our travel. I am a former army mechanic and I worked on several air bases, never have I seen something move so fast a and silent, the other witnesses said it was a low flying jet and the sonic boom made the electronics go out.  But I know that you can not fly a plane that low at that speed, and a sonic boom would have blown out our windows and ears.  Nothing that I know of other then an E.M.P. could have done what this aircraft did. After the incident I called several media centers to see if anyone else has reported seeing anything but they refused to tell me.;40.6832;-76.2113
Orange light moving slowly across the sky.;2012-08-07 20:00:00;10-30 minutes;Orange light moving slowly across the sky. We were sitting outside in our back yard when we seen a orange object going from east to west.   Than a half an hour or so we saw another one going from west to east in a differant area.  The third one we say going north to south.  It wasn't the space staion cause it moved to slow and it had no noise when going over head nor was it blinking.;40.6832;-76.2113
