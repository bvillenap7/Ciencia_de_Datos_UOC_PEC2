Metallic Object with con trails dissapears.;2010-11-10 16:40:00;2 minutes;Metallic Object with con trails dissapears. Was looking southwest when I noticed 2 thick bright white contrails that looked like they were coming off of a twin-engine jet.  Watched it descend for about a minute. It turned a bit and caught the sun. When this happened the object turned a bright metallic.  Even at the distance it was very bright. I looked down for not even a second to put something in my pocket and when I looked up again the object was gone, and so were the con trails. It was as if nothing was ever there. The sky was blue, and clear.  No clouds in sight.  NOTE: about 30 minutes after this sighting when I returned home there was a ton of air traffic.  Jets and other types of planes were either doing a grid pattern or circling around the town I live in.  I saw at least 6 different ones. Some of them were low enough to hear. This lasted for about 20 minutes.  Normally you will see 2 planes an hour here.  Two weeks ago, my co-worker also reported seeing an orange orb at the same place I saw my object that went straight up, banked left and took off at a high rate of speed.;40.6832;-76.2113
