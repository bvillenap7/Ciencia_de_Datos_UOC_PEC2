Thought it was Sirius, but 15 minutes into the sighting we saw Sirius rise over our into our line of sight.  A sky watching program confirmed this.   We watched the object for over 30 minutes.  It moved closer to our position.  That's when we could tell that it was saucer shaped.   Also, our dog refused to go outside.  She acted like she was afraid!   There is no way that we were the only people who saw this!   It was almost exactly between Sirius and Orion.;40.6832;-76.2113
