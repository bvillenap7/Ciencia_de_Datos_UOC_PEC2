Fire Ball not seen more then 2 people;2010-06-19 21:45:00;30 Seconds;Fire Ball not seen by more than 2 people It was overcast silent out.  I looked through window of my house seen a big ball that was red in color that went over it.  Heading straight ahead, i have looked in news for 3 days now since i and my grandfather have seen it.  No reports of it, couple seconds after that people were out and shooting fire works off, it was too big for a fire work, and it was slient.  It went 3 miles till i couldnt see it anymore. Heading straight didn't see it descending or incresing in altitude.   Why was there no report of it, was it a ufo, or something else military was covering up.;40.6832;-76.2113
