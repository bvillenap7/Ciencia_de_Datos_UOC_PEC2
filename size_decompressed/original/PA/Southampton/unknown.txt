String of lights over the PA Turnpike;2008-12-23 01:30:00;2 minutes;String of lights over the PA Turnpike I was driving east on County Line Road, just crossing over the PA Turnpike.  I saw a string of lights hovering ESE.  It was three white lights, well above the trees, but too low, I believe, to be a typical aircraft.  I slowed down to get a better look, I was the only car on the road, but there were cars on the Turnpike below me.  The lights hovered for about a minute in one spot, then slowly moved NNE, vaguely following the line of the Turnpike.  The lights rocked slightly as they moved.  I watched the lights until they disappeared below the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.185;-75.0041000000001
