Grew small and vanished as it drew back At around 11:15p.m. this orange ball came from the corner of our home moving very slowly, with no noise.  (This was not a helicopter).  Looking from our deck if you were to hold a dime to the object, that would be the size of it.  It moved to a point and began to come closer to the deck.  It then stopped in mid-air.  It did not move for approximately 30 seconds and it then receeded backwards, getting smaller as it moved and vanished.  It did not disappear into a cloud, it simply got smaller in size and disappeared.  There were no flashing lights on this object.  This was just a steady orange glow, in a very steady line.  This said, my daughter, ninety minutes earlier, saw the same thing at the location she was in, in the same town, and it did exactly the same thing.   Thank you very much for your time.  Hopefully, someone else saw it too.  Very Cool.   I do not believe weather balloons move in this manner.  This was something very odd.  Please let me know, if someone other than my family member saw this.;40.185;-75.0041000000001
