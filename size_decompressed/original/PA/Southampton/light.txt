2nd time bright blue lights were spotted over Southampton.;2006-11-23 00:00:00;4 sec;2nd time bright blue lights were spotted over Southampton. I was going out with some friends when i was knocking on a door, me and the driver saw a odd bright blue light fly in a slightly cruved line across the sky.  I thought I was crazy until the person started asking me if i saw what he saw on Thanksgiving night.  Our stories we mostly the same except for the endings because the trees block my view. This blue light just shot through the sky. Heading towards Willow Grove Airbase. I am wondering if this has anything to do with a metor shower.  Because last year on the 28th of Nov I was out with my friends in Southampton and 3 bright blue light shot over my head.  They both looked the same and traveled at the same speed and in the same direction.  Both time the object went behind trees.  Other aircraft were seen in the sky but that is because we are over a civilion and military flight path.;40.185;-75.0041000000001
