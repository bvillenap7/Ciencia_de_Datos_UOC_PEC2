Huge bright yellow/reddish  trangulair light in the N sky;2008-08-08 23:11:00;50 minutes;Huge bright yellow/reddish  trangulair light in the N sky My son and myself were on our porch and we were checking out the stars cause it was a very clear night and I saw at first what I thought was a star and then I thought maybe an airplane but then all of a sudden it just seperated like two trinagles and had a glowing haze around it , it was just hovering for awhile and then it disappeared, I was pretty amazed cause I never really saw anything like it , unfortuntely my son is only 5yrs old so his concept of understanding was he asked me if it was ET and I said  actually it was  or some kind of foreign object. It was defintely a ufo , it was a very clear night and I look at the stars where I live alot  and  have not seen anything even remotely close to it!

I saw two identical UFOs this evening about 45 miles away from each other.;2008-11-18 18:00:00;2 minutes;I saw two identical UFOs this evening about 45 miles away from each other. I saw a UFO twice today, in two different locations.  I have seen the same aircraft 7 times now in the last month.  I am a well-educated woman in her 20's who is not crazy, but I can't explain what they are.  The aircraft is shaped like a trapezoid (although it may be a triangle- I only see it at night), and has two extremely bright headlights.  On the two corners that stick out most there are lights.  One has a red light, and the other has a green light.  The colored lights lead me to believe that it is man-made, but I'm not aware of any aircraft like it. It doesn't have wings like an airplane, and it doesn't fly like an airplane.  It hovers over an area, very low.  I frequently see them when I drive west on the PA turnpike Tuesday evenings.  I drive from the Willow Grove exit to the Downingtown exit.   Tonight I saw the UFO at 6pm in Southampton, PA.  Then I saw it again (or another one) 1 mile from the Downingtown exit of the turnpike.  That one turned all of its lights off a few times, plunging it into darkness.  I thought that was odd.  Last week my husband was in the car with me and saw it, too.  He didn't know what it was either.;40.185;-75.0041000000001
Large triangle with blinking lights that moved erratically with motions impossible by our aircrafts.;2014-09-25 22:45:00;5 minutes;Large triangle with blinking lights that moved erratically with motions impossible by our aircrafts. Saw large bright light falling toward sky.  The light then stopped and hovered for a moment and then started ascending.  We followed the source of the light and saw it begin to make erratic movements in the sky.  We turned around onto another street going the opposite way, and the object turned around and came towards us and was closer to the ground at this point.  When I saw it pass over us it was a large triangle, with blinking lights on each point of the triangle.  It then shot off into the sky in an instant with no warning.  This is my third UFO sighting and all have been in Southampton.;40.185;-75.0041000000001
