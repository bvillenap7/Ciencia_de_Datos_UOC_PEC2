While taking in a dip in the pool with two others, I noticed this blackened object just beneath the cloud ceiling.  Traveling completely slient, the object moved eastward and appeared to maintain a constant fast speed across the sky, while tumbling end over end.  I reached out to my friends to observe this object.   Each of us were stumped, for it did not resemble any object we have ever seen.;40.185;-75.0041000000001
5 round objects, hovering, flashing lights.;2015-07-22 21:30:00;15 minutes;5 round objects, hovering, flashing lights Saw a BRIGHT, gold, star looking object hovering above the trees.  Assumed it was a bright star.  Starred at it for 5 minutes.  Then it moved up into the air quickly, and started flying away fast.   Then a second one appeared and hovered above the same tree.  Shot up and flew after the first.  This happened a few times.  In total 5 objects.  Assumed they were planes and wondered why there was so many.   Ran to back of the house and looked closely, only saw the last object which appeared round.  Red and gold flashing lights all over the bottom which is how I could tell it was round.  Vanished in the clouds.;40.185;-75.0041000000001
