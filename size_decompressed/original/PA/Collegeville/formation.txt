Formation of large and small objects merging into one object.;2003-03-16 16:30:00;2 minutes;Formation of large and small objects merging into one object. I witnessed an unusual looking group of black, round objects around 4:30 pm., at a children's park in Collegeville, PA.  These objects were seen in the area of the Limerick/Pottstown airport, but did not look like conventional aircraft, balloons, etc.  There was a round object, with small round formations attached to the bottom of it.  Surrounding the bottom area of this object were smaller, round black dots (like bees around a hive). All seemed to be moving slowly, and in unison, across the sky. By the time I ran over to my daughter(age 13) to get her attention, the group of objects seemed to disappear, leaving only one craft.  It was primarily black, but with a yellow corona around the bottom.  My daughter saw only one object, which she said looked silver to her, with a yellow glow.  The one object slowly continued across the sky, than hovered for a brief time (roughly 20 seconds).  It then disappeared completely.;40.1922;-75.4339
