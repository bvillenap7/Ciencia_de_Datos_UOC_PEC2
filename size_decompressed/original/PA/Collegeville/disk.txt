2 green lights, 2 red lights one object.;2014-05-05 22:30:00;3 minutes;2 green lights, 2 red lights one object. Was driving home alone from boyfriend's house and as I approached the stop light at 113 where there's that creepy bar and the Hess/Dunkin Donuts I looked up and saw an object in the sky.   I put my window down and got a closer look I could not figure put if it was close to me and just really small or if it was large and far away.  My perception was skewed.  Also, I tried to take a picture with my phone and it just said photo cannot open.  I popped my head back in the car window to put my phone back in my purse and get another look at the object but when I looked again it was gone.  I could not decipher what the actual shape of the craft was as it was completely dark out but it had 4 lights in a diamond formation.  (My best guess was it was saucer shaped   I tried to rationally figure out what it was but I keep circling back to extraterrestrial.;40.1922;-75.4339
