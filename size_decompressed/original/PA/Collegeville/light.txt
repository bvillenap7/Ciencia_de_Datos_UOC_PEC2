White dot of light traveled across the sky, very fast, then shot away.;2013-09-14 20:35:00;1-2 minutes;White dot of light traveled across the sky, very fast, then shot away. One dot of white light (non blinking) traveled across the sky at a fast clip. From northwest to southeast in a minute maybe?  It seemed as high as a star, but travelled too fast to be a satellite. It did not burnout as a shooting star would in just a few inches. If I held my arms up in a V shape, (like the Y in the YMCA dance) that's how far across the sky it travelled.  My family of 4 saw it and a family of 6 up the street saw it too.  When it disappeared it seemed as if it blipped out by moving further up and and away into the atmosphere.  It was not a plane, shooting star, planet or satellite.  I have never seen anything like that before in the sky.;40.1922;-75.4339
Spot light in sky.;2014-02-17 20:00:00;1 hour;Spot light in sky Was outside helping a friend load his furnace, and happened to look up.  Minimal clouds, I could see stars.   Could not help notice what looked like light coming through the clouds as if the moon was behind them, yet that was not where the moon was.  Almost looked like there was a powerful spot light from the ground hitting that area of the sky.   A friend that was located about 5 miles away had called, and I told him what we were seeing and he then went outside and could see it as well, 5 miles away.   It was very strange, considering I am a pilot, have been staring at the sky for 40 years and never seen anything quite like it.  Just wanted to report it.;40.1922;-75.4339
30-40 lights moving south to north and silent.;2014-08-19 21:00:00;20 minutes;30-40 lights moving south to north and silent. Saw lights in formation.  Silent and some moved faster than others.  It was one after another.  Friends said they were Chinese lanterns but the way they moved, the moved pretty fast.   I'm a private pilot and have never seen anything like it.   Moved from the south to north then turned slightly east.  The lights were orange, red and blue.  Brighter than aircraft.
