Hovering ufo started to move, and then transformed into a plane.  ((NUFORC Note:  Landing lights, we believe.  PD));2016-07-18 20:00:00;3 minutes;Hovering ufo started to move, and then transformed into a plane. Clearly a UFO, 3 dots in a line with a faint outline of standard UFO shape.  Hovering in the same spot for about a minute, then started moving in one direction, switched directions, and transformed into a plane.   I couldn't believe it. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Honestly, I still do not believe it to be a plane, based on the way it moved.  It was clearly stationary for about a minute before it headed towards the moon, stopped, and went the other way.  Also, the only air ports around here house small personal planes.  Thank you for responding. I do appreciate it!  ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object was a C-17 military transport a/c.  We just witnessed a C-17 in the night sky on the night of July 21, 2016, and noted that it had three landing lights, one in the center, and two toward the tips of the wings.  PD));40.1922;-75.4339
