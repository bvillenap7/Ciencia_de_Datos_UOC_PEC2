Six or seven white lights in a row that turned red, then back to white and quickly flew away;1975-01-15 21:15:00;20 seconds;Six or seven white lights in a row that turned red, then back to white and quickly flew away I was walking my dog shortly after 9 PM (he always asked to go out about 9 PM) It was January in the early/mid seventies. While walking in a northwesterly direction on Lloyd Road (see map) I saw what appeared to be an airplane with its landing lights on approaching me just above a house on Cheyney Road. I was startled because there seemed to be at least six or seven very bright white lights in a row. I had never before seen so many landing lights on a plane, there are usually only two, maybe three or four at the most. We live along one of the approaches to Philadelphia International Airport (about five miles SW of us) so I have seen many planes approaching with their lights on. I looked at the lights for a few seconds, there was no sound of a plane, only the wind blowing. Suddenly the area around all the lights turned a bright red/orange, sort of a flattened oval shape. Where the white lights had been, the red/orange color was brighter than the rest of the object. The color was very intense and reminded me of the intense type of color that you get from a welders torch, only it was an intense red/orange and not blue. The object then began to move sideways (easterly) and at that instant it turned into a white color again, turned and moved extremely fast away from me in a north easterly direction and quickly vanished in the distance. The whole event lasted about 15 or 20 seconds.  I never told anyone of this event but after seeing a television story about the January 2000 object near East Saint Louis, it reminded me of this event because the lights in a row seemed to similar to what I had seen.
