((HOAX??))  It was like a fireball hovering, but it disappeared out of thin air.;2015-08-23 23:15:00;00:01:30;It was like a fireball hovering but it disappeared out of thin air, I was anxious when it was there. It was like a street light but it flickered like a flame it was yellowish-orange to gold in color. I was very confused but anxious too.  It hovered for a short time, but when I blinked it just vanished out of thin air.   Mother does not believe me and cats were not scared, for it was not a street light on the highway.   I went outside to check out the area but there was no evidence that something was there, it was no car though. Yours sincerely,  Anonymous ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the report is a hoax.  We telephoned the source of the report, and spoke briefly with a young woman who simply claimed that it had not been she who submitted the report, and abruptly hung up.  Hoax??
