As you're reading this please keep in mind that I'm a teenager so I probably won't make much sense! Anyway I live really far out in a place my friends and I call Hickville USA. But one night my friends ((four names deleted)), and I decided that we were going to play a little game of the infamous Hide-and-Go-Seek. We split up into teams, each team equipped with one flash light. ((two names deleted)), and myself were on one team... the team that hides. After walking around the neighborhood for a little bit we decided to go into the corn feild. We walked for a little while and decided that it was a good place to stay. We talked for about five or six minutes when we heard something. ((one name deleted)) decided to go check it out, he tried to turn the flash light on but it didn't seem to work. We finally made our way to the edge of the feild. As soon as we got there two very bright boomerang shaped objects caught our attention. We watched for a little bit and then we heard the noise again. It was a sound so seemingly peaceful that it was creepy. ((one name deleted)) turned around and told us to look. So ((one name deleted)) and I turned around to see another craft. This one was a lot closer than the other two. It hovered above our heads for a moment almost trying to let us know that they saw us. And then with amazing speed it went up with the other two and they seemed as if they were dancing. It was beautiful yet eerie at the same time. Then they just slowly got smaller and smaller until they were gone. To this day everyone thinks that we're insane.;40.8018;-78.0788
