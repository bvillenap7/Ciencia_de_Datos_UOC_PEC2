It wasn’t until I looked at the photo and recognized the object to the right of the eagle. I initially thought it may have been an insect but there were very minimal in my view nor did I experience many insects while taking photos nor does it depicts a bird.  I also recorded a video of the beautiful scenery only after reviewing you can see an object dart out of the trees at crazy speeds directly into the sky;41.7373;-77.3054
