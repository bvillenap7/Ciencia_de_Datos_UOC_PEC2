bright star-like object , surrounded by green and red lights;2001-03-18 23:15:00;45 min.;bright star-like object , surrounded by green and red lights I was looking towards the western sky around 11:15 pm. I saw a very bright star-like object with green and red lights moving around it. It appeared stationary for about 20 minutes. It was pretty high in the sky and looking at it with binoculars the object's lights (red & green) seemed to be rotating around the bright white object. It was much brighter than a star, and the night was clear.It slowly moved into the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the star, Sirius, but that is a guess.  PD));40.1776;-79.8678
