My wife and I were picking out new celestial objects in the sky to view with our telescope when from the Southwest I saw an orange round object appear.   After a few seconds more began to appear traveling towards us.  I took a still photo with my phone while the wife ran for the binoculars.   I then switched to video for about 30 seconds and quit because I wanted to see with the binoculars.  One of the five vanished as it traveled to the North.  The others which seemed to be holding a pattern vanished one by one traveling Northeast. I managed to watch the last one as it traveled overhead and away all making no noise.  I could see an round orange halo from behind and a dark round center.  The objects appeared to be like round fireballs with large halos but on the lower right portion (as can be attested to by enlarging the objects from the video/photo) was a horizontal dark surface.;42.2008;-79.8332
