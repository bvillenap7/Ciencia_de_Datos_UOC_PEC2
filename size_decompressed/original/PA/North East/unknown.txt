I was sitting in my driveway looking up at the stars and I heard something come out of the woods at the end of my street.  There is a creek at the end of my street so I was wondering how they came out of there.   This thing started walking up my street and it was walking very weird and was wearing black robes and a weird hat with a point and a curve and had feathers on it.   So I hid behind my car waiting until it walked near my house. Note: it was walking the same pace the whole time.  And I said hey what are you doing and they didn't say anything back and kept on walking at the same pace up the street.   So I started following them and at the other end of my street are more woods.  I was right behind this thing!  The thing got to someones yard and I was 5 feet behind it and started walking into the woods.  I turned the flashlight on my phone real fast within 2 seconds.  I didn't stop walking when I was turning it on.   When I looked up with my flashlight, i! t was gone...  It just vanished into thin air.  Nothing! I looked all over with my flashlight, there was nothing. I just don't know. I want and explanation and I want it soon.   I do not want to live in fear know what I saw.  I just remember every dog barking at it and it did not even flinch.   Just someone explain this.;42.2008;-79.8332
