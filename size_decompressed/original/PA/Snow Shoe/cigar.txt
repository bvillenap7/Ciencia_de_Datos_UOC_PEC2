When i was about 12 years old, in 1998, I was with my dad at his hunting camp along with a few of his friends.  the camp is located several miles deep in the woods, the closest town being snow shoe, PA. at about 10 pm we were standing on the front porch of the cabin when we noticed a fairly low flying object passing overhead.   It was an elongated shape with six lights on its underside that formed two triangle shapes facing opposite directions:  &lt  &gt. the object moved very slowly, taking about 2-5 minutes to pass overhead.;41.0408;-77.9554
