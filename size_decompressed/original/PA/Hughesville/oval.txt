When the object appeared, it looked like a quarter moon in the sky.  When it got closer, it looked more like an oval in shape with a smaller oval on at the top and a cut off cone shape at the bottom.   There were three rows of lights, in the center. The lights looked like stars. The color of these lights were a blurry white or some sort of white tone.  When the object was in the distance, it almost looked like stars that were coming out of the sky and getting closer.  There was no sound made.  It seemed to move quickly following our vehicle for about 10 minutes, then disappearing.;41.2541;-76.7178
