comet shaped object hovering in the sky.    ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 21:00:00;8-10 mins;comet shaped object hovering in the sky. i seen only one, i am 16 years old so i just got my license, and i was driving around our small town, when i was turning around in front of our community build and I looked up and i seen this light in the sky. I pulled over down the road farther to talk to my girlfriend and some of her friends, and showed them.  It was  egg shape but bright to a point, it looked like a realy bright star cluster, but it was to bright, I guess a better way of explaining it is that it looked kida like a comet.  I am not no freak about like aliens or anything, and i realy doubt it was from a differnt planet, but after it happened there was like 6 planes flying around were it was, in a formation, and i know my planes, they werre all single engine jets, like a f-16 or something.  they were pretty low tho.  But weather u beilve me or don't it ok, i just though that you guys might get some use out of this, becuase i am telling u everything i know about it.
