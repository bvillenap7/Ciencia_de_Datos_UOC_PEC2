Beam of light with no sound no indication of light source eerie radio broadcast afterward.;1988-08-08 01:30:00;4 minutes;Beam of light with no sound no indication of light source eerie radio broadcast afterward. My two friends and I had just seen an INXS concert in Pittsburgh and were heading to WVU to take one of my friends back to her dorm.  In the early morning hours of August 8th, 1988, around 01:30, my friends and I were heading southbound on Interstate 79.  Because of the late hour and the lack of lighting on this stretch of road, it was difficult to see anything other than our headlights. On a stretch of dark road around exit 23 (Marianna/Prosperity), we saw a large circle/ball of light to the east that was shining a very bright beam of light all around:  over the ground and along the low hills.  We pulled over to the side of the road and one friend and I got out of the car to investigate.  (My other friend remained in the car, screaming.)  At first, it seemed like a search helicopter due to the fact that it could stand still in the air and sweep its light around.  However, we were surprised because there was no noise whatsoever. The other thing that confused us was that it seemed as if there were nothing behind it.  I’d compare it to seeing lights from a billboard and being able to detect the shape of the board beyond the lights.  There was no hint of any craft or body emitting the beam, even when it faced away from us. We finally got spooked when it slowly started working its way over toward us.  Before it could sweep its light over us, we jumped back into the car.  It never shone on us, but rather abruptly shot back eastward into the night sky and disappeared.  After we started driving again, the radio was first ‘static-y’ and then it auto-tuned to a stop.  We heard a commentator say “…further evidence that there is life on Mars…’ and then it went back to static.;40.0483;-80.1727
