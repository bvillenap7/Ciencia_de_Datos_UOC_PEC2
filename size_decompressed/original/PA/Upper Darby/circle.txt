A round very bright white light with rays of light coming from it.  It was very close and kept going lower gradually. There was an auto accident at that intersection. By the time I got up to where it would have been it was mysteriously gone! It almost looked like a large version of the star the wise men saw that guided them to see Baby Jesus.  Like when you see the exaggerated version in a cartoon like the Little Drummer Boy.  A plane seemed to be nearby.;39.9561;-75.2719
