Extremely bright stationary light over Phila. airport vanished.;2018-02-27 18:10:00;8 minutes;Extremely bright stationary light over Phila. airport vanished. From Upper Darby, I noticed a very bright stationary object in the sky to the east near the Phila. airport. It was still light out and the sky was clear.   At first it was just a bright light, but lights began to flash around it as a passenger plane passed by at the same altitude.   Then suddenly the light went out.  Very shortly after that, a fighter jet flew overhead, headed toward the airport.  It was close enough to see missiles on the wings and on the underside of the jet.  The jet moved slowly and noiselessly over the neighborhood, in a eastern direction toward where the object had vanished near the airport. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) Dear Mr. Davenport, I can assure you this is not a hoax.  I understand your question and was surprised myself that it was quiet and what was odd was that it was flying low over the neighborhood.  I am ((age deleted--50's)) years old and have seen many thing in my lifetime I know enough to know this was an out of the ordinary experience.  I regret not taking a picture I was on my phone at the time.  I understand this sounds odd but I wouldn't have reported it if it wasn't so odd.  My wife of 35 years encouraged me to report it.  Thank you for your inquiry.  Sincerely,;39.9561;-75.2719
