Small orange orb slowly moving across the sky;2010-07-04 21:00:00;2 minutes;Small orange orb slowly moving across the sky Ok so we where out behind our house getting ready to do some fireworks when my mother noticed what looked like a helicopter off in the distance.  It slowly moved towards us.  As it got closer I went and turned down the music and we heard nothing.  At this time the object was around 500 feet above the ground.   I know helicopters you can hear pretty good and all aircraft have to have blinking lights.   This thing didnt and was moving very slow.  It covered maybe a mile in a 2 minuted time frame. It looked like a burning orb maybe 20ft in diameter.  As i went to get my camera it slowly dimmed to nothing over the hilltop.  It came back for about a second then dimmed again.   It's pretty crazy i know but if my mother and sister and friend didnt also see it i would think im going crazy..  If anyone else seen this please post about it;41.4902;-78.6796
