We like to watch for satellites, the ISS, etc., and have seen these plenty of times and are very familiar with them.   At 22:17 (10:17 PM ET) we saw this orange light appear from the NW sky and it moved slowly across the sky to the NE and then disappeared as it reached a certain point in the distance, much like a satellite does.  However, unlike a satellite or the ISS, this object was much larger, approx. the size of a dime held at arm's length and it was orange like fire, but was not a fireball.  It was bigger than any airplane lights and there were no flashing lights.  It was just a solid orange light and it was silent.  It took around two minutes to move across the sky.;39.8861;-75.3349
