I began to look into the sky and i noticed a very small, close pattern of stars.  I watched them and they began to slowly fade and come back.  I looked VERY closly and saw that particular are was a different color from the night sky.  I ran inside to get my friend to show him.  We eached watched and I tried to get a picture.  But i was shaking from the cold and couldnt get one at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Possible hoax, but we cannot be certain.  Next report in sequence is from same area code.

Then a very bright light blink green, then red, and cycled back and forth between these two colors for approx 15 seconds, then stopped, then went to a white flashing and departed in an eastern direction at what appeared to be a very fast speed.   What struck me as being odd was that it was partially cloudy but the red/green flashing light was extremely bright, and with a much increased size compared to the flashing moving white lights.;39.7818;-77.747
