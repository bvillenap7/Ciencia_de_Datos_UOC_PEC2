Adjacent and east of US Route 81 and adjacent and north of Route 16 near Greencastle, Pa., we saw an object that looked like a large orange fireball which appeared to be several hundred feet above the ground.  It then started to drop and immediately burst into yellow flames and fell toward the ground.  It seemed to be completely burnt up by the time it hit the ground.  We then noticed what could have been a helicopter leaving the area heading north.;39.7818;-77.747
