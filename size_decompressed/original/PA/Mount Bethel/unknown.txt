I peered up into the sky and noticed 3 stars next to each other, then i looked again and realized there were about 7-9 of these stars? encircling the power plant.I stopped the car to get a better look, and in the center of this was a plane at highspeed which seemed tobe escorting or being escorted by 2 other craft (not sure if they were planes or not). Around these encircled stars? there were small aircraft encircling them flying at what appeared to be leisurely pace. About 5. Everything was at a very high altitude. I tried my best to observe as I drove on, but then they were out of sight. Less than 30 minutes went by before I was returning on that same route , the airplanes were still flying steady around the power plant and the stars? had disappeared. I drove on another 2-3 miles and was just peaking at the roads ridge, as if out of  a space movie there were 7-9 stars? in a jagged V formation stretced out in                                                                                  mate to be about 5 mles. Now I was just a little creepd out at that point, and in the blink of an eye they vanished. I did a few inqires  and naturally no one saw a thing. This was my second sighting in 3 days, in my life, I was not scared in anyway and infact almost found it comforting, as I am located 60 miles south of Manhatten and about 80 miles east of Three Mile Island. I am hoping since this was right after the attack on America that our government or Allies were out there watching these vulnerable sights. I do know of 2 people who have witnessed some activity  very near the same area. Also days later I was telling this encounter to an associate and they asked if there was any interferrance with my radio during this sighting, yes there were actual total segments of song interrupted by what seemed like aCB but I did not make out any language. This person lives i! n this v icinity and was experiencing radio interferrance in that time table. The other people will be writing in to verify their sightings.;40.8977;-75.1126
