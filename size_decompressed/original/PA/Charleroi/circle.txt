what appeared to be an invisible craft just dissappeared into thin air;2007-11-28 11:00:00;30 seconds;what appeared to be an invisible craft just dissappeared into thin air While standing on top of a hill, taking a break from deer hunting, we were looking at the pretty view and notice 2 circular objects hovering in the air right about the trees.   The objects appeared to invisible (like in the movie predator).  When the object moved you could see right through it and see what was behind it.   Both objects were very close together with the bigger one on top and smaller below it.  Both hovered in the air and looked like it was spinning like a tornado.  Then it just disappeared into thin air!!;40.1379;-79.9173
