Observed initially 4 bright gold/ orange cylindrical objects in sky viewed from hilltop of Charleroi Oakland Avenue and 4th Street  looking eastward toward Belle Vernon /Fayette City.  They were at random spots in no particular formation, and appeared far away in the sky.  Objects were stationary at first, then moved sporadically spot to spot without seeing them actually travel from point to point. Initially I thought it was the setting sun reflecting on a plane, but there would not have been 4 planes at the same area, and they did not move like a plane.  Object furthest to the right appeared to quickly become smaller (as if moving further away) and then vanished from sight.  Then another object appeared in the same direction closer to the horizon, but brighter in color (brighter gold glowing) –it appeared to rise higher in the sky from the horizon, and then also vanish.  When then looking back to where the re! maining original lights were they were also gone.  I have never seen anything like this before, and 4 additional people saw this also.  I have a picture and 2 short videos on my cell phone, but there is a street light in the foreground and with the dim light the pictures are grainy and do not truly depict what I saw.;40.1379;-79.9173
