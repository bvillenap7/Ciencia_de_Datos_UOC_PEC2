Within 5 minutes there was about 30 aircrafts.  One of the aircrafts of a group of two aircrafts flying northbound split off formation and joined another two aircrafts traveling westbound.  The aircraft that broke formation turned at an unheard of 90 degree angle instantly.  This is way more activity than I ever noticed at night or in the day ever. Also these aircraft were traveling extremely faster than I have ever seen an aircraft fly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
