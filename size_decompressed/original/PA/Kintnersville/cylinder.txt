We were thinking it was a planet but then we saw it drop dramatically and go to the right and as it traveled away from us, we saw red lights on it and then we saw it hover over trees. Even when it has been cloudy and there are no stars out, this bright white light is still there. We got our telescope out and the next night we looked at it and the way to describe it best was it was shaped like a round fried egg, sunny side up.  I think that is the best way to describe the shape of what it looked like.  The rim of the cylinder was solid and it outlined the cylinder.  Then last night when we were traveling on Rt. 113 in Comar, PA, we saw another bright white light the same as the one we looked at with our telescope.  Usually about 9 PM everynight, the bright light, UFO, drops and travels away from our sight and it always has red lights on as it travels away from us.  We live in Bucks County, PA and there have been many recent sitings of UFO's here.;40.5339;-75.2087
