I carve and paint birds from wood and do most of my finishing outside as was the case on a beautiful afternoon in October of 2000. On this particular day there were a multitude of jet planes coming from the northeast flying at a very high altitude over head and on to the south or southwest. I could barely make out their shapes,(of course the contrails were very visible)and since a friend had given me a new pair of binoculars I became curious and went in the house to get them. I watched the jets for a while until my neck started to strain from looking straight up and so I was about to continue with my work when I looked over towards the northheast horizon and noticed a dark dot in the blue sky. I walked toward it about 20 feet and put the binoculars on the object and watched it come toward me. It started to veer to my left and I had a perfect side view as it crossed the western sky. It looked grayish silver and was oblong in shape about the size of a small jet plane to the naked eye. It made no discernable noise and had no wings or tail but when I put the binoculars on it as it crossed before me I could see that it had a protrusion above and also below that made it look like a symmetrical top. I watched it until I could see it no more. Later that day I drew a picture of what I had seen and took it to my neighbor who was a military pilot and now flys for a commercial airline.He looked at it but could not identify with it at all.
