Craft rose in the western sky to the right side of Saturn.  We were out with telescope and originaly thought it was a firework.   For a minute it looked like it was hovering but it actually was moving from west to east.  The object looked like a tear drop and when it was directly over head it looked like it had a central ring through binoculars.   The object was orange made no noise and definitely was not a plane, balloon, fireworks, or any other known object.  It also did not seem to be a meteor.  This object finally disappeard in the east.   What I find odd is that at the same time exactly a year ago an identical object was spotted from the same area of Pennsylvania.;40.5777;-75.3251
