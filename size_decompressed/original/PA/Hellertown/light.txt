Very slowly moving green, red and white lights flashing in the night sky.;2001-09-11 23:00:00;1 hour;Very slowly moving green, red and white lights flashing in the night sky. In the northen sky,50 degrees from the horizon.Both objects were flashing red, green, and white lights and moved slowly in a circular motion. Then one object moved up to about a 60 degree angle, the other one went below the horizon.  We observed for about an hour went to sleep thinking it must have been satelite or something and we'd look for it the next night, but it was not there.  Take note there were to be no airplanes flying in the air this night because of the terrorist attacks.  We heard airplanes flying over before which drew our attention outside, these planes went in an opposite direction of the lights.  We figured they were military aircraft, but these light did not appear to be anything we had seen before, they were very slowly moving, almost stationary,about the size of a very large star. ((NUFORC Note:  Description appears to us to be not inconsistent with that of twinkling stars, but that is only a guess.  PD));40.5777;-75.3251
