Larger craft and small sphere using cloud as cover.  ((NUFORC Note:  Photos show tiny speck.  PD));2015-07-27 19:15:00;2 minutes;Larger craft and small sphere using cloud as cover. July 27th.  Berwick PA.  7 miles south of the Nuclear Power Plant.  Looking West slightly SW.  Bright sky, cloud formations very odd for this area.  Puffy funnel type cloud.  Sunny sky about 7:15 pm.   I was walking the dog and looked up and noticed how odd the cloud looked in relation to the rest of the sky.  A bright silver object that looked like a lifesaver appeared to the right of the cloud and then it quickly darted back into the cloud formation.  If I held my arm out the object would have been the size of a pencil eraser end.  The center circle was well defined as was the outside edge.  The shape was perfectly round.  The inner ring appeared to encompass 2/3rds of the entire object.  The center was darker.  I saw small flashes in the cloud, not like lightening but like dots.  I do not know if these flashes were from the object or from the sun glinting off of the object.  I then took my camera out and took photos but I did not get a good photo of the big one I saw but! I did get one of a much smaller dark silver sphere.  No birds or bugs were about,  I think due to the 90 degree temp and high humidity. I will email the pic.   P.S. the dog was not impressed. ((NUFORC Note:  Photos show tiny speck.  We are unable to determine what it is, but we have no reason to assume that the object is an authentic UFO.  PD));41.0682999999999;-76.2458999999999
