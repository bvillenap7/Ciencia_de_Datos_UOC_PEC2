There were branches blown down from trees.  We were traveling south from Houtzdale to Madera on Route 53.  We were below a plateau where a cow farm with a silo for cows is located.  We both saw an orange-yellow ball of light hovering above a silo at the cow farm.  He said to me, do you see that light?  What is it?  I began to speed up.  The sphere has stationary.  As we approached the top of plateau, the light took off fast on north course toward Madera.  I sped up to over 90 MPH and the light kept moving away. I began to flash my headlights and beep the horn. The light source went to the horizon.  Normally, at that speed, it should have vanished over the horizon.  But the light source stayed at the horizon and seemed to have waited for us to cross the plateau and decend into the valley.  We went up on to the next hillside where we lost contact.  There was an eerie glow in the area and my brother was deathy scared and did not want me to exit the car.  I exited the car but did not see anything.  However, I believe it was something not of the ordinary. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.8231;-78.4282
