I was driving. I saw a bright light in the sky. I asked my boyfriend if it was a star. He said it was a helicopter. It was an unusual light because it caught my attention. I thought it must have been a new technology. It was dusk out and there were clear skies. We only saw one white light that was very bright and then it seem to have the bright light shut off. The off light was dim and round and blurry because I didn’t have my glasses, I wasn’t able to see the actual shape of the object. It wasn’t a helicopter after all because we didn’t see the spinning wings of a helicopter once the light was off and then I told my boyfriend it was a U.F.O.! He said it wasn’t a U.F.O. because he said that it was supposedly an alien spacecraft. The dim light disappeared into the sky. We were driving downhill on Main Street, in Akron, at the Loyd H. Roland Memorial Park. This light was seen in the sky which it was hovering above the intersection of Main Street and Park Stree! t. My son is twelve years old. He was in the van with us and he also seen the light which we all assumed it was an alien spacecraft.;40.1609;-76.2017
