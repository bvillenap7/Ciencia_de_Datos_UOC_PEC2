Orange Orb/Disc over Pymatuming Lake;2012-06-30 21:30:00;90 seconds;Orange Orb/Disc over Pymatuming Lake At Pymatuming Lake.  The fireworks were about to begin.  We were sitting next to the dam overlooking the lake.  About five minutes after the test firework went off.  We saw this bright glowing orange, yellow, reddish orb, disc fly up in the horizon.  It was miles in the distant horizon.  It was ascending at a steady pace traveling west to southeast.   No noise was heard.  No flickering lights.   As it continued to travel in a SE direction.  It shut off.  We thought it disappeared.   We immediately fixed our sights on it again, and it was totally black.  Still traveling at a the same rate of speed torwads the south.   We all thought then this was not a plane or a helicopter. Because planes or helicopters cannot just turn their light off.  We were able to take pictures of it with our phone cameras.  Was able to zoom in real good.  The orange orb/disc if clear in sky.;41.4566;-80.4492
