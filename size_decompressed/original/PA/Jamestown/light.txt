Further observations concluded no lights or becons, no sound and a slow movement from East to West. As it moved further away, it appeared to be somewhat of a triangular shape with two lights that looked like a type of propulsion system on the back, but the actual shape was hard to be determined, it looked triangular like I said, but cannot be positive of that.  Appeared to be about 10,000-15,000 feet with absoulutely no sound.  It was a dull yellow color that was headed towards populated areas such as Youngstown and Cleveland.  I have taken several astronomy classes in college and my father who wittnessed it also flew for a major airline for 30 years, and he said he had no idea what it was.;41.4566;-80.4492
