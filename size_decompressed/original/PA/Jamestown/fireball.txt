Four fireball orbs visible over Pymatuning Lake.;2016-08-20 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;Four fireball orbs visible over Pymatuning Lake. My husband and I were leaving, walking along the shoreline of Pymatuning Lake in Jamestown, PA, when we saw three large reddish-orange glowing orbs in a triangle formation.  He saw them first.   They moved slowly over the lake, and at first, I thought they were newspaper lanterns.  When my husband said that they were much larger than that, I began to watch them and realized they were not lanterns, nor were they anything we'd ever seen before.  We estimate that they were probably around the Andover, Ohio, area, but appeared large to us, even though we were about seven miles away.   As we watched, we saw fourth light, a smaller light trailing behind.  They glowed, but the three larger orbs held formation while the smaller--more distant--seemed to try to catch up.   They disappeared suddenly as they approached a tree line.;41.4566;-80.4492
