Two large balls of light over a highway or above some fields.;2008-05-30 00:43:00;1 minute;Two large balls of light over a highway or above some fields. -Very early morning at 12:43am on 5/30/2008-  2 round white objects of approximate size of the sun spaced apart in the night sky. I was scared so I didn't bother to stop and didn't even think to take a picture. I just wanted out of there. As I drove up the road, they didn't appear to move at all. Total time I saw the objects was for nearly 1 minute.  My guess is that they were directly over RT. 119 or at about 40°06'48.94N   &   79°33'20.79W and were probably 1700 to 2500 feet high  I am 100% sure they were not 2 helicopters with searchlights but don't know what they could have been.
