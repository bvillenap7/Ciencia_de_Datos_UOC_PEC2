Strange object not blinking but glowing strangely.;2007-03-20 20:15:00;3 to 5 seconds;Strange object not blinking but glowing strangely. I just saw an object that appeared to be moving faster than a plane but much slower than a comet/meteor.  The object was shining much brighter and then dim as if it were coming closer and then ascending back.  I tried to get my brother to look at it but it was simply gone.  The night tonight is perfectly clear.  I plan to go back out and keep looking...;40.1031;-79.595
Bright object that flew away quickly;2007-09-11 20:45:00;4 to 5 seconds;Bright object that flew away quickly Bright object suddenly appeared in clear night sky and was moving at what looked like a normal speed of an airplane but object was quickly getting dimmer and appeared to be moving away, toward the direction of Zeta Cassiopeiae. Object was apparently traveling away from Earth at a very high speed. Object was no longer visible after about 4 seconds. The object remained bright white and did not flicker, blink, or emit any meteor-like trail. Do not believe it was a 'shooting star' or any known aircraft.;40.1031;-79.595
