UFO sited over field, street map included.;2001-03-10 22:30:00;15 seconds;UFO sited over field, street map included. Three of us, driving a Jeep Cherokee Sport came to the stop sign at a T in the road (3-way intersection near Sharon-Bedford Rd), looking straight ahead, saw what appeared to be a bright, yellow-white light, 10 to 20 ft in diameter, traveling with a very slow velocity, at height of 100 to 120 ft. I cannot recall its direction of travel or period with which it was present.  Our observation took place at a three way intersection with little or no interference from other light sources (a country road far from cities). The object was seen above a regular field.  I cannot recall how the object left our field of vision, but I do remember it leaving in the direction from whence it came. I could not place street view at the stop sign, but I did manage to orient it in the correct direction of the sighting nearly 40 yards from where we were sitting.  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=hermitage,+pa&sll=41.178234,-80.526781&sspn=0.025001,0.055747&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Hermitage,+Mercer,+Pennsylvania&ll=41.169512,-80.514958&spn=0.012066,0.027874&t=h&z=16&layer=c&cbll=41.170804,-80.517492&panoid=lVfoQX8Lfd18pZU3qynQcg&cbp=12,234.58,,0,5 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
