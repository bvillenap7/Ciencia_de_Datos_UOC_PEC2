It was a bright, crystal clear day in Glenolden, Pa. on June 19,2013 , when I noticed a very bright star-like object high in the eastern sky.  I grabbed my camera and got 5 excellent photos of whatever it is!  This may turn out to be a satellite but the Nikon Coolpix P 500 I used has a 36X optical zoom and I'm just not sure if it could capture clear photos of a craft in orbit.  You will notice in photos that there are different profiles suggesting that maybe it is turning.  I will send all 5 photos and a short video clip if I can.   Thanks !;39.9022;-75.2942
