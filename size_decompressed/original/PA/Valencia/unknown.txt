PD));2006-12-16 07:00:00;2 minutes;At approximately 7AM I noted a spiral shaped or zigzag jet steam arising from the opposite horizon.  The pattern was so wide and irregular it caught my eye.  I never saw the shape of the object, but I did see the shape of the light coming from it.  It had a brightly lit front nose that was followed by a conical white light body.  It disappeared and reappeared x 3, but the jet stream remained behind it. At one point it burst into bright fireball light and disappeared, but reappeared again.  I woke my husband and son to see it.  By the time my son woke up there was only the wide spiraling jet stream. Mu husband saw the light object.  It reminded me of a comet, but appeared to be traveling parallel to the earth's surface and not toward it. It did not appear to be getting closer to the ground when it disappeared.  It also reminded me of the space shuttle and one was launched Dec. 9. .  I also read that the military launched a new stealth jet yesterday.  Any of these may be possibilities, but it was certainly special to watch.  I hope this helps. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.  PD));40.6983;-79.9239
