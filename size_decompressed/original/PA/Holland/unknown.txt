Pulsating Light That dances across the sky;2003-05-04 22:15:00;2.5-3 MINUTES;Pulsating Light That dances across the sky At 22:15 - Sunday, May 4 I was outdoors and noticed a bright pulsating light dancing overhead (soutwestern sky).  Dancing means that this object maneuvered qucikly left and right, at one point appearing to backup.  As best I could tell there was no sound.  I called my wife outside and she witnessed a more subdued motion as the pulsating light moved over the house and continued northward.  The size of the object was not readily determined - close and small or far and large - but the strobascopic nature of the light reminded me of an episode on Discovery - a light powered disk (laser pulses for propulsion).  The craft however must have flown a considerable distance, even if it was small and close.  The movements were quciker than any plane I've ever seen and the path was erratic and to the best of my knowledge beyonf the scope of any publicly known aircraft.  The fact that there were no military planes scrambled or pursuing this craft made me think that it was some sort of military machine.;40.185;-75.0041
