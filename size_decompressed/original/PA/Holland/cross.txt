Explosive white circular light;2020-07-28 05:27:00;20 minutes;Explosive white circular light Bright white object in sky, larger than a star and hovering closer than a star.  The object exploded a few times into a large white circle. At one point I could see light on the sides of the object pulsing (in a cross shape) almost like wings. It eventually ascended upward into the sky resembling a star but remained in the sky until a little after sunrise. I took a video of it with my phone.;40.185;-75.0041
