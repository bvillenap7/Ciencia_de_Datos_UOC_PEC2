Slow flying triangle craft with flashing lights on all three points;2021-08-19 09:45:00;2-3 minutes;Slow flying triangle craft with flashing lights on all three points I was driving away from Mifflinburg on Forest Hill Road towards Route 192 when I noticed flashing lights ahead in the sky. They weren't too far above me since I was able go make out what it looked like pretty well. It was a triangle shaped craft and I would best describe it like the ones you hear about all the time... triangle shaped, flashing lights on all 3 corners. They were flashing mostly green and white. Very bright and very low. Very slow speed. I couldn't look for too long since I was driving so I don't know if it did anything crazy after it was out of view behind me;40.9241;-77.052
