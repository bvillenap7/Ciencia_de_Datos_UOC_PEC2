2 UFOs sighted in the middle of a busy intersection in Cranberry, PA.;2014-10-08 07:50:00;3 minutes;2 UFOs sighted in the middle of a busy intersection in Cranberry, PA. My daughter and I were sitting at the redlight on the intersection of rt. 19 and Rt. 228 , when she say the man next to us in his car, with his window rolled down and pointing at the sky with unbelief on his face.   I rolled down the window and looked where he was pointing.  I saw 2 balls of gold light that floated with no noise.   My daughter and I were frightened and said that is 2 UFOs!  then she said mom, are you sure its not helicopters, I said yes because there is no noise at all.   As the balls approached and were directly above us we looked and saw then that they were 2 very distinct saucers that we could view from underneath, they were rotating within the gold light.  Very scary to us! the light changed and we had to move with traffic.   We are unsure of how many people viewed the 2 UFOs, but we know at least he man in the care beside us saw it too.;40.685;-80.1071000000001
