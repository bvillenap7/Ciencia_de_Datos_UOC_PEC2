10 fireball fly over PIttsburgh area in straight line, 2 people took videos;2012-06-02 22:15:00;15 minutes;10 fireball fly over PIttsburgh area in straight line,  2 people took videos At approximately 10:15 p.m. on 06/02/2012 I noticed a large orange yellow globe rise over the horizon.  I  live in Cranberry Township, PA and it is a hilly area of Western PA.  My first thought was that it was a hot air balloon on fire.  As I looked it was followed by another.   I called my husband and we both grabbed cameras.   By the time the event was over, we observed about 10 of these orange fire balls go over.  They were headed in a straight line, flying ENE from Pittsburgh. We strung a few of our videos together and put two videos on YouTube.  One is labeled “Missiles over Pittsburgh 06/02/2012” is probably the best one.   The other “Cranberrytwpufo.qt”   A search in YouTube should bring them up quickly.  The Missile one has views from both my camera (I tried to do close-ups) and my husband’s cell phone video where he captured the things passing near the moon so you can get some perspective. They were going fast, and we heard no sounds from them, although a helicopter did fly by while we were out filming.  I really think it was a jet squadron being moved, but maybe someone can look at the pictures and see if that makes sense.  We’ve all seen planes fly at night, but I’ve never seen 10 or so round glowing fireballs go over.   I suppose it is possible that up until now I’ve never seen a group of military jets fly across the night sky at high altitude on a mostly clear night. I have read a written description from someone driving in Kentucky at the exact same time that most closely describes what we saw.   In fact, numerous google searches for the evening of 06/02/2012 “ufos” turned up about 4 sightings that I would consider identical to ours.  They ranged from Illinois to New York, all occurring at the exact time (the one in Illinois is listed at 9:15p.m. CST). Just thought I’d share.
