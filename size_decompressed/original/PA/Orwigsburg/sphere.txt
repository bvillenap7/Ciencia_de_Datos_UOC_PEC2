I saw a ball of light outside my window one day. O.o;2007-01-10 12:00:00;2-3 secs;I saw a ball of light outside my window one day. O.o One afternoon, I was listening to a soundtrack I had gotten on my birthday and gazing out my window when I saw an odd thing in the trees. As I was staring, a huge, cream-colored object(it was a perfect circle) appeared suddenly in the middle of the trees, shot off diagonally, and dissappeared. I have NO IDEA what it was, but I can tell you I 'supposedly' had an abduction earlier that month(it was January). At first I thought it was one of those balls of light you see when you rub your eyes really hard, but the thing was TOO BIG.
