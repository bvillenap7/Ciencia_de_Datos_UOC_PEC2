What I saw I can sure was not an ordinary plane or helicopter first of all it hovered, and second it's altitude was to high to be a helicopter. I pointed it out to my friend and he saw it as well although not for the duration that I had since he was the one driving.

shadowy light ending as sphere;2008-01-05 05:45:00;15-20 min;shadowy light ending as sphere Saw a shadowy light in southeastern sky from welsh mt. area.  Moved very fast back and forth a couple times, I thought perhaps it was a spotlight, but there was no trail.  Appeared again several time going back and forth, in comparison to an airplane light in the sky it was much, much larger.  Informed my husband and it took about 5 minutes or so till he saw it, this time it traveled differently, beamed across the sky and left a sphere light before disappearing.  I still saw it several more times within that half hour or more.;40.1025;-76.0761
