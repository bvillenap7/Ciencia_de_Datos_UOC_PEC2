light and weird mist in sky over Chalfont, Pa. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:00:00;2 minutes;light and weird mist in sky over Chalfont, Pa. Saw bright round light moving East across the sky. Light had a beam shining down from it. Moved into a misty cloud, light began to dim and then went out. Mist traveled for another 15 to 20 seconds and then evaporated, the light and mist were gone. The odd part is that this was a cloudless, star-filled sky. After the mist dissipated, the stars were visible again. Very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.2874;-75.2156
