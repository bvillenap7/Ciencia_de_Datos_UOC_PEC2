4 long cigar-shaped objects spotted in Bucks County, PA.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-23 16:00:00;3-5 minutes;4 long cigar-shaped objects spotted in Bucks County, PA While observing a hawk soaring 300 feet above the ground, I noticed a green light at a much higher altitude - approximately 40,000 feet, just slightly below the upper level cirrus.  Then I noticed the light was on one end of a fairly long object with a yellow light on the opposite end.  The shape looked like the edge of a silver iPhone, with a green light on one end and a yellow light on the other.   After observing it for 20 or so seconds, I noticed 3 more identical objects appear slightly below the first.  The group of objects appeared to be moving in a south-easterly direction, though at a very slow speed.  Over the course of a minute or 2 the lower 3 craft disappeared from my sight, but the one I initially spotted was visible for nearly 5 minutes.  It eventually became more and more difficult to pick out in the sky.  These objects were higher than any of the commercial airliners that few by the vicinity. There were other people there with me but were unable to see! what I was seeing. Background:  I'm a sailplane pilot and often look to the sky at soaring birds.  I've noticed that if you stare at a patch of sky for a while on a clear day you can find gaggles of birds soaring in the 3000-5000 foot range.  Also, I don't like flying with polarized sunglasses, but on this day I had a new pair that are polarized.  Sunglass can help you see definition in clouds and sky that you wouldn't otherwise notice.
