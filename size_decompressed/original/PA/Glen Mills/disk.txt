After taking about 20 shots I later downloaded the photos from my Olympus Digital camera onto my computer.   As I looked at the photo's I noticed on at least five of the photo's you can see a disk shaped object in the sky near the rainbow.  In one shot there is a jet and also the disk. In another two ufo's.  When the photo's were taken my sister and I did not notice the objects.  I can send the photo's taken with my 12 Megapixel camera.
