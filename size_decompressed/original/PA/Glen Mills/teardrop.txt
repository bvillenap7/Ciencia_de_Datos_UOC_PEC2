We have windows in our house that are very large and everywhere. I got something to drink and sat on my couch. Pearing out of my window  I witnessed 3 large teardrop like crafts floating about a few feet higher than the top of my house. There was a glare surrounding the outside of them. One was higher than the two and in the middle... and the others were lower and on oppisite sides of the middle one. I could tell they were spinning. All three of them were spinning towards the right of me. I stayed opened my back door and I heard a sound. It sounded like a loud humming sound. I was shocked because this was the second siting I've seen within two years. The same thing came to my attention though. They were white and had a glowy look to them. After i gawked at it for about 4 minutes they started to get a little higher and took off at what seemed to be the speed of light up into the air. It left a trail of a redish white streak of light that faded away within seconds.;39.904;-75.5089
