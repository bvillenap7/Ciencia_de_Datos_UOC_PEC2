Bright Orange Lights.;2015-09-13 21:00:00;3 minutes;My husband called me outside.  I saw 6 very bright orange lights moving slowly and quietly across the sky.  My husband said there were more before I came outside.  They didn't look to be in any formation and I could not tell what shape they were.  They each just looked like a big very bright orange light.  They passed slowly but one by one they disappeared.  I went inside and a few minutes later I went back out.  There were now 4 in the sky, even lower than the ones before.  Again, slowly moving across the sky until they disappeared.;39.904;-75.5089
