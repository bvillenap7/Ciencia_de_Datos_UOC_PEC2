Saw 2 bright orange lights followed by two more;2012-06-05 22:30:00;10 minutes;Saw 2 bright orange lights followed by two more My mother and I were driving home from Robinson Twp.  She looked to the northeast and asked me what those lights in the sky were.  I looked and saw 3 bright orange circles (they almost appeared to be on fire)in the sky.  Two were flying side by side followed by another.  We drove to a better vantage point where I got out of the car to try to see them better.  By this point the two that were side by side were now in a single file line with the third.  The first two passed thru the clouds and could not be seen.  As the third started to get to the cloud cover a fourth appeared and followed the same path as the rest. I am a retail salesman and my mother is a customer service representative.;40.4688;-80.0872
