I brought the object to the attention of my companion. Then I went outside to have a closer look . The object appeared to be the shape of a dorsal fin and had lights on its various axes.  The object traveled westward  and continue to ascend for about 5 to 6 minutes until it was no longer able to be seen.  The object was silent and its travels.  The object appeared to be either metallic black or metallic dark blue and the lights appeared to be rotating like a light house light rotares.  I live very close to an airport and have observed numerous Aircrafts however this one was unlike any I have previously observed.;40.4688;-80.0872
