Estimate that it was very high, and at that altitude was traveling very fast across sky.  Observed it climbing from half way up the horizon at about a 30 degree angle until it disappeared.  This is the second time I have observed something like this in the same location of the sky.  I couldn't discern wings or tail rudders. Clear blue sky, middle of the afternoon.  One object, one witness.  I am a Lutheran seminarian and a hospice chaplain.  I formerly served as an instructor in two undergraduate liberal arts colleges.  Am NOT a scientist or technician of any sort.  And I admit I have lousy eyesight.  Nevertheless, I believe I can tell an airplane from something else, and I believe this was something else.
