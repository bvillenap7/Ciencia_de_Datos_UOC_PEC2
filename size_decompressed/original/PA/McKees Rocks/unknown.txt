Red, green and blue horizontal lights, up to five crafts - not in formation;2004-11-08 22:30:00;23:45;Red, green and blue horizontal lights, up to five crafts - not in formation I was outside taking the dog out - it was a clear night and I started looking at the stars.  I noticed one around the little dipper that was twinkling very brightly.  Then I realized it had different colored lights blinking so it couldn't be a star.  It was stationary though.....I looked around and spotted more.  I went into the house to ask my husband what he thought.  He agreed that the one by the little dipper was unusual. He said it definitly had different colored lights on it and it was not a star.  At one point I saw up to five but then some clouds rolled in and only 3 were visible.  They stayed in the same spot for over 1 hour - then I went to bed.  They had red, green and blue lights blinking on them.  They UFO's were too far apart to be in any formation. We do have an an airport pattern that runs over our house but these were not airplanes.  They were very high up in the sky but stayed in one spot. They were not stars as the lights were different colors and blinked at different times and the lights were in a horizontal line.  I did not see an outline of the craft so I do not know it's shape. Both my husband and I tried to locate the objects with binoculars to try to get a better look but couldn't.;40.4688;-80.0872
