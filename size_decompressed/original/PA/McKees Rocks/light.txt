Bright red shining object;2012-08-31 23:35:00;4-5 minutes;While sitting on my porch with my friend, we noticed a bright red shining object in the sky north east from where we were moving south west towards us.  This object began moving in ways I've never seen and at one point came to a stop and was floating in the sky.  At one point there was a plane flying towards this object and had to change its course to avoid hitting this object.  Once the plane passed the object it then changed its course again to get back on its original course. After about 4-5mins this object then began moving away from us towards the course it came from.;40.4688;-80.0872
Red lights hovering above Pittsburgh suburbs.;2020-12-29 20:00:00;5 minutes;Red lights hovering above Pittsburgh suburbs saw a red object approximately 30k ft in the air several miles off in the distance. I live in a flight path near Pittsburgh Airport and it was definitely not a plane or helicopter. It was moving slowly towards the SW then stayed in place for a minute or 2 above the Robinson Twp area. It then appeared to move west and accended out of sight. The air force base and airport are both in different directions from where it was above;40.4688;-80.0872
