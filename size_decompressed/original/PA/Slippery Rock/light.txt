Orangeish small lights flying mostly in a V formation with no sound  at least 500 or more for at least 3 hours;2004-04-17 00:30:00;3 hours;Orangeish small lights flying mostly in a V formation with no sound  at least 500 or more for at least 3 hours I was sitting on my back porch when the first ones flew over.They were in a V formation and there were about 15 of them.They looked like geese in formation but were orangeish in color.I tried to dismiss them as birds but could see them for several miles.Then a few minutes later another 20 or so went overhead.I was talking on the phone with my sister in Washington(state) and told her what was going on then I went and got my wife out of bed.Just as we got back outside another group of 10 went overhead.She was skeptical until another group of 50 or so went directly over us.They were traveling south to northwest.I then talked to my brother-in-law in New Castle and he saw them also.I don't know what they were but they were going faster than anything I've ever seen in the sky.I really hope some one else saw these and knows what they were or at least saw them.In all I saw at least 500 or more and was up until 03:30 watching them.Also there was no sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length via telephone, and he seemed sincere to us.  However, we do not understand how a sighting as dramatic as the one he describes can take place, and only one group of witnesses observes the phenomenon.  Moreover, we do not understand why the witnesses would not telephone authorities, or friends, in order to have other people witness the alleged event.  We received no other reports.

Bright light flashes me followe next day by weird creatures coming out of my mirror.;2013-06-06 03:30:00;4 minutes;Bright light flashes me followe next day by weird creatures coming out of my mirror. I walked out on the stoup with my 2 dogs at 3:30 AM and looked across to the big tree about 50 feet away and above it was a big bright light.  I thought to myself, I should get my flashlight and flash them twice.  When I thought this they flashed me twice, on the second flash it faded out slowly like an opera light.   Which tells me they could read my thoughts from a distance, which amazed me. But on the very next night I was awakened at 4:00 AM by bright blue lights coming from my full length dressing mirror on my bedroom door.  And out of it came 3 weird creatures with long arms and fingers waving at me as they came towards me.  I threw something from my night stand at them and they went back into the mirror.  Then I had an implanted thought that they were dimensional travelers.  I watched my mirror turn with clouds and blue and white bolts of lightning coming down in it.  There were mountains and clouds behind it all.  Then it dissipated.  Ever since then I have a severe case insomnia and sleepwalking and do weird things when I am sleepwalking.  I am now seeing a sleep specialist and am scheduled for a sleep study on Dec. 19, 2013.  For the last six months there are punctures and scratches appearing on my legs in the morning like I have been out in the woods.  They shouldn't be there.  I pray to God that everything will work out for me.  I am telling you the truth to the best of my knowledge.;41.0454;-80.0468
