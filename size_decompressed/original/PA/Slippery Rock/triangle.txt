Was not of this planet.;2020-08-14 16:00:00;Seconds;Was not of this planet Triangle shaped with a round light at each point and one in the middle. Appeared to be just above tree line but I knew it was very high in the sky . Didnâ€™t seem to be going super fast but I knew it was and just had the feeling that it was huge, like the size of Texas huge. When it went over and until it was out of sight it was like I had on noise canceling headphones like it was more quiet than quiet . The whole thing is hard to explain but it was not anything from this planet I am positive of that.;41.0454;-80.0468
