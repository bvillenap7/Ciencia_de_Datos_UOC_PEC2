2 Triangular Low Flying Craft in Glenside PA.;2013-01-31 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;2 Triangular Low Flying Craft in Glenside PA I was out on my back porch having a cigarette, when I noticed 2 lights heading towards me traveling north east.  I was surprised because they were not on a normal flight path I usually see in my back yard and they were flying together in formation and very low to the ground.  As they slowly moved closer I could see that each craft had 3 white lights in a perfect triangle shape and no colored or flashing lights.  They were extremely quite, low in the air, and  slow moving compared to the planes I normally see flying in and out of PHL.  I estimate that they were only 200-300ft in the air and at least 60ft across.  They flew in line one after the other until they passed over the tree line out of sight.;40.1101000000001;-75.1567
I just know something hovered by tonight over the top of our car that I cannot fully explain and unidentified.;2016-09-22 21:30:00;2 minutes;I just know something hovered by tonight over the top of our car that I cannot fully explain and unidentified. I was driving home with my boyfriend around 9:30PM from my Aunt’s house on September 22, 2016, after her birthday celebration.  I was sitting in the back of the car because the front seat had boxes on it.  As I was sitting in the back my boyfriend said, “Look at that plane.”  I had no clue what he was talking about, since he said it was over top of our car and not in my view.  I did not pay attention to what he was saying, because I could not see anything.  Next thing you know, I just looked out the side window from where I was sitting and saw this massive object in the sky. I just had this feeling in my gut something was off and strange about this object.  It was shaped as if it had three missiles attached in a triangular formation.  It was black and blended into the night sky.  The object had this blinding bright light just at the nose of it not moving.  It had appeared to look like a stealth fighter shape my boyfriend stated.  It was extremely low to the ground it was hovering right above the top of the trees. I was confused and I had this weird feeling.  I thought my boyfriend was joking about what he was seeing, but when we rolled down the windows it was completely silent and moving extremely slow, hovering just at the top of the trees as I looked up at it.  There was something eerie about it and I just can’t stop thinking about it.  I am not sure if what I saw was anything, but I just know something hovered by tonight over the top of our car that I cannot fully explain and  unidentified.
