PD));2009-09-19 20:00:00;15 seconds;A triangular bright light pointing downward in a haze on a clear night. While attending an outdoor birthday event, a bright light was observed in the sky.  The light was triangular and pointing downward.  At first it appeared to be a helicopter searchlight in the clouds but once the light retracted, there were no clouds or any aircraft in the area.  The sky was completely clear.  It was the strangest thing I ever saw in my life.  Several others witnessed the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.1101000000001;-75.1567
