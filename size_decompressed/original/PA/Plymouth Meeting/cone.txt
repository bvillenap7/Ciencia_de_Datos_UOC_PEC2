Cone of light, higher than plane or helicopter, Did not move. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:00:00;30 seconds;Cone of light, higher than plane or helicopter, Did not move. Faded away without moving in 30 seconds. No clouds in the sky. Walking friend out to her car in my front yard. Looked up into sky and saw a cone shaped light as if a flashlight was being shone. About the height of a plane. We thought it was a plane but when we decided it wasn't, called others in the house to quickly come and see.  My friend said it's going away and thought it was going behind a cloud. I looked and with her, saw it slowly fade away. There were NO clouds in the sky and many stars were visible.By the time the others got there, it was gone. I'm just curious to see if anyone else witnessed this. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.
