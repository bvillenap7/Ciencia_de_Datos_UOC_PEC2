I was taking trash out.  And there was this very bright object, brighter than any stars flickering and not moving.   After I walked down to the sidewalk to trash and walked up my driveway.  The object disappeared nothing in the sky.  Few minutes later saw a very dim red flicking object slowly moving across the sky. Almost like it was hidden but could still see the flicker.  No sound or anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  No date is indicated by the source of the report.
