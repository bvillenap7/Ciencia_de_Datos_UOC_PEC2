The first fireball was seen traveling from north to south.  It looked like a semi-transparent red sphere with something yellow in the center.  After it had passed by, a second followed the same path.  It was identical in appearance to the first. At that time, I alerted the second witness.  He only saw the second one and it was some distance away looking more like a strange star at that point.;40.8325;-75.7013999999999
