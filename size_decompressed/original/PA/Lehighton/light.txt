S. on 16NO99.  This is the type of report that makes us somewhat uncomfortable with the notion that the event was due to meteors.  Meteors do not accelerate.;40.8325;-75.7013999999999
Unexplained lights over lehighton Pa;2011-12-23 16:30:00;couple of seconds;unexplained lights over lehighton Pa on the early evening of the 23rd,a bright point of light above the treeline caught my attention since there was a heavy cloud cover.  My friend said it was probably a star popping through a clearing in the clouds, so we watched for a couple seconds. The light returned and appeared as a brilliant white spotlight which at first we took to be a helicopter,until the light blinked out and instantly a triangle formation of bright white lights flared on,the whole object appeared to move to the left at an unbelievable rate of speed and vanished.  There was no sound that we heard and whatever it was it was close enough that we should have heard something.;40.8325;-75.7013999999999
Two green lights following my vehicle on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from member of law enforcement.  PD));2014-11-27 23:00:00;:0030;Two green lights following my vehicle on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. On the above date and time, I was driving northbound on the Pennsylvania Turnpike at about mile post 88 when I saw a steady green light in the southbound lane north of my location.  There were no other vehicles in my sight.  The light appeared to be about 4 inches in diameter and about 4 to 6 feet off the ground.  I was travelling between 75 and 80 miles per hour and I was not gaining on the light as fast as I thought I should at the speed I was going. After a few seconds, the light rapidly moved southbound until it was alongside my vehicle and immediately matched my speed.  The light was directly across from the drivers door.  It was on the opposite side of the concrete median but was much closer to me than it was to the embankment on the west side of the highway which was about 40 feet from the center median. The light stayed alongside me for about 3 tenths of a mile and then abruptly stopped.  I looked in my mirror and the light appeared to be 3 to 5 feet to the west of the concrete median.  At this time, a second green light appeared at the same height and about 8 feet to the west of the first light and both lights began blinking in unison. Both lights continued blinking for about 5 seconds and then both lights disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Report from member of law enforcement.  PD));40.8325;-75.7013999999999

Each experience has one common denominator a circle of brilliant white light that slowly and seemingly deliberately moves to the left then up to the right then down. It's not in the same order every time and at points it seems to move forward as in towards me and then in the same way move backwards from me very quickly. This morning I observed it in the eastern sky for an hour. My first experience, a few weeks ago frightened me bc of how close it was. I thought that there were 2 but I can't be sure. The light appeared in the southern sky and I observed this about 45 mibuets and convinced myself that it was some new kind of drone. I went to bed but woke up 2 hrs later and there it was even closer but in the same south quadrant moving slightly west. I felt like it had an awareness of me observing it. This feeling overwhelmed me mentally when it went dark then bright like it turned it's self off and on. Tonight it did not turn off and on but I felt as if it knew I was studying it. Then in the far far distance I began noticing other lights. Roughly 9-12 spaning from the north to east and south orange and blue in nature and didn't move. I am freaked out. I didn't know who or what agency to file a report to. I am college educated with a degree from Penn State, own my own home that I share with my son. I have no reason to waste time creating a story, then searching for society fringe to hock it on via this time consuming post.;40.8325;-75.7013999999999
