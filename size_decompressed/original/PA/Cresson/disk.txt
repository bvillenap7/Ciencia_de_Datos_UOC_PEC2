A UFO followed our car!;1986-10-03 21:00:00;2:00;A UFO followed our car! My husband and I were on our way to our hometown of Altoona, from Latrobe for a visit. It was my husbands birthday.  We were coming up over the top of a mountain it was misty out but not raining.  We looked up and above the trees was a disk. I opened the window and looked out and the disk went above our car.  It followed us for a short distance.  The strange thing was, time seemed to slow down.  What should have taken a minute or so to go over the brow of the hill, seemed to take longer, like 5 minutes.  I looked under the ufo and it seemed to have thousands of real bright spotlights shining down on us.  I was afraid we might get sick from the lights as I wasn't sure what it would do to us.  After a time we passed the trees and I turned around to look and sure enough it stopped and hovered above the trees as we continued on our way.  My Husband saw it too and he is the biggest sceptic and he was even upset by what he saw.;40.4617;-78.6008
