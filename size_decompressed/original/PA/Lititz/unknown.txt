Around 5:00 am, as I jogging through town, I saw a single bright glowing white spherical cloud expand and quickly take shape in the clear southern night sky.  It grew to about the size of a half dollar, as if it were held in front of you at arm's length.   After about a minute, it slowly dissipated, leaving a hazy residue behind.  Further away, roughly South East of the first observation, a second spherical cloud formed.  Besides it doing the same things as the first, for a few seconds, it displayed an iridescent hue. The sky was very clear, and I remarked to myself how visible the constellations were.;40.1846;-76.3015
Unknown lights in night sky.;2016-07-14 21:45:00;15:00;Unknown Lights in Night Sky UFO SIGHTING on July 14, 2016 – DESCRIPTION:  This is the full description of the event I personally witnessed. The event took place on the night of Thursday – July 14, 2016. The start time was about 2145 hours Eastern Daylight Time. My iPhone 6s recorded my first photo being taken at 09:48:09 PM-EDT. The events duration was about 15 minute--until about 2200 hours EDT. My location was in Warwick Township, Lancaster County, PA. My observation coordinates again per my iPhone were as follows: 40 degrees 7’ 56” North - by - 76 degrees 19’ 4” West - & - Elevation 390’. I was facing West at about 305 degrees from true North. The object appeared to be located at a very high altitude. It also appeared to be at a considerable distance from my location. Only 2 mall white dots seen – suddenly a red laser type beam went from near the 2 lights towards the northeast then laser went off and white lights were again all that remained – so then they moved east passing way overhead very slowly – with no noise!  It passed behind building & went out of sight.;40.1846;-76.3015
