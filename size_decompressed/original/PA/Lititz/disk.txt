Disk  sighting in broad daylight;2004-04-16 13:20:00;15-20 Sec;Disk  sighting in broad daylight I was headed towards Lititz, Pa driving on route 772 between Rothsville and Lititz in broad daylight. I had just past the Lititz Springs Creek and was rounding the bend in the road, when a disk shaped object appeared about approx. 150-200 feet above the tree line. It was descending toward the treeline at about a 30 degree angle and in a 45 degree bank at a high rate of speed. I would guess that with the bottom of the disk shape towards me and with no observable features on the bottom it was perhaps 10-15 ft across. It was black in color and entered the treeline. Trees had no buds nor leaves on them, as it is early spring. I can only assume that it did not crash as there are houses along the ridge under the trees. No noise was heard and no local reports have been reported. This spot is also about 2-3 miles from Lancaster Airport. I'm also a pilot and can pretty much identify anything aloft.;40.1846;-76.3015
