Small Spherical Object moving silently to the West;2006-01-17 22:30:00;10-15 seconds;Small Spherical Object moving silently to the West At 10:30 PM, I was on the deck behind my house. As I looked skyward, I noticed a silent small sphere moving in a Westerly direction at a good rate of speed. I observed the object for what seemed like 10 or 15 seconds and lost sight of it after it flew over my neighbor's roof and beyond. It did not appear to change altitude. The object was dark but I could not make out the color. There were no lights on the object. The sky was overcast, so this object was moving under the backlit cloud cover. My first thought was that it was a small latex balloon that got loose. I was smoking a cigarette, and it occured to me that the wind was blowing in the opposite direction. I went back inside and checked the local news website and confirmed that the wind is blowing to the East.;40.1005;-75.3708999999999
