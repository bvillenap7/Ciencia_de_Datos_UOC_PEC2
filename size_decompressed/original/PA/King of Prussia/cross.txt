At approximately 9:30 pm on Monday night August 9th, 1999, I invited my two sons (aged 8 and 15) to climb up on the roof at our house to observe the stars and sky.  We observed the North Star, Big Dipper, etc. and we saw a number of airplanes also pass by.  At approximately 10:00 PM, I noticed what I first thought was a small formation of birds flying overhead.  I told my sons to look my 15-year son had seen them before I said to look.  He happened to be looking at the spot in the sky where they appeared.  My 8-year-old scoured the sky and then saw them in about 2-3 seconds.  It occurred to me that birds do not glow and that they flap their wings. These objects had what appeared to be fixed stubby wings crossing a relatively short body compared with conventional aircraft.  They were flying at about the height one would think high-flying birds might fly (which I guess is why I at first thought they were birds).  There seemed to be no noise surrounding these objects.  They were flying fast (perhaps twice the speed of the jets that we had seen pass overhead), in perfect formation (diagonally?) three across and emitted a dull but penetrating orange/brown/yellow glow.  Our visual contact lasted about 5 to 15 seconds.  All three of us are absolutely certain we observed this sight. I, the father, am 50 years old in perfect health.  My 15-year old son is going into 9th grade and my 8-year old is going into 3rd grade.  We all have good sight and none of us had ever seen a UFO before.;40.1005;-75.3708999999999
