3 people see formation in Pennsylvania sky;2011-09-04 21:10:00;2 minutes;3 people see formation in Pennsylvania sky On 9-4-11 we were sitting on the porch facing the southeast sky, first saw one light and then 2 others appeared. They flew in a perfect triangle formation, moving slowly northwest. The objects performed elevation changes with what appeared as no effort. They changed their orientation so that they flew straight toward us at first and then the triangle was moving sideways across the sky. A jet flew past the formation, it had no green or red lights on it,and about 30 seconds after the jet passed it disappeared.   The lights were visible for approximately 2 minutes.;40.1005;-75.3708999999999
