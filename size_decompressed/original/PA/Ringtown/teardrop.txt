I could still see the ,object cetting closer .I ,opend and closed my eyes to make sure i was seeing what i was seeing, it was still there after about 30 sec. I could sence it was paceing me almost like raceing with me ,I had no sence of danger ,or panick ,but I did feel amused,by it ,the object then pulled ahead,and i lost sight of it ,for a few sec. but as i got farther up the road ,thiere it was ,over a farm house .just hanging motionless ,no sound ,no movement ,nothing ,it had a  orange,glow to it but not like a light or anything .like a reflection,of light as i passed by it ,I realized just how close I was to it only about 50 ft or so .although i did`nt stop I did slow down ,enough to look at it to make sure I was`nt seeing things.I made the rest of the trip home ok but felt realy funny ,what was i going to do about it,were my thoughts,i just left it alone for a while ,then while I was in the store,I seen a tabloid ,with a pic.of what the space shuttle crew had seen ,I almost fell over it looked like the object I had seen only without the reflective glow to it ,teardrop ,upsidedown with oshaped windows in it and , since then I haven`t been able to get the sighting off my ,mind .;40.8548;-76.232
