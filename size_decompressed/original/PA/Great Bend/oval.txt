I am an avid hunter. I spend about 50 to 65 days a year in the woods hunting white tail. Today at or about 7:30 am I was getting off I81 south, the Great Bend exit when i looked into the sky and saw an object that resembled a blimp,{somewhat}that was very football shaped and about a inch and one half long @ 5 miles away. the sun was just coming up so i thought it was a blimp or an airplane that was in flight and slowed to look @ it.  within an instant ,the object i was looking at went from a standing position to light speed and disappearing in less than 2 seconds.  the passenger that was with me awoke from sleep and asked why i was going so slow on the off ramp. I told him what had just happened an slowly made a left toward the service station to get gas.  the whole time looking @ the place in the sky that i had just seen this event. the whole sky was blue except for two airplane discharge trails that were present. I've been a whitetail deer hunter since i was 12 yrs old.  I think that my eyes are in great condition, and this has me in a loop. I know what i saw. Know one can ever take this away from me so help me god. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));41.9691;-75.7465
