Before passing Longwood Gardens on the way to Oxford, Pa, I witnessed a large, bright shape in sky to my southwest.  It was blue, white, yellow & green. It had a white tail, like a shooting star.  It was almost like the Girl Scout symbol in shape.  I know, since the road was crowded, others saw the same thing.  It didn't seem to be documented on the news or in print.;39.867;-75.5928
