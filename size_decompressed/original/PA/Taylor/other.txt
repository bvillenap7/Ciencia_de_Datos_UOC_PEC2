So I get a feeling like its looking at me now I'm shaking in fear at this point!  It was a about the size of a go cart and square which I found odd and had 4 very very bright lights on each corner!   So now it proceeds to follow me on my side a little distance away from me I was so scared I'm swerving at this point! I thought it was coming for me...finally it dispersed fast...now take in to account this is moments literally before the big storm came huge lighting and tornado storm we got and winds we're crazy so my first thought of a huge drone is out of the pictureâ€¦ Honestly, the most terrifying experience I've ever had!;41.3875;-75.714
