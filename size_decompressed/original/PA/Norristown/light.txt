I was looking up at the stars on this night and noticed a light moving across the sky. It looked to me like just another star,only it was moving.It moved in a straight line moving towards the east.I know it was'nt an aircraft because I saw no visible strobes on the object.I watched it until it was out of my sight. This was very strange to me because if it were a shooting star, it was moving much too slow and emitting nothing. If this were an aircraft,it was moving very fast and I would have seen some type of strobe or flying lights which I did not.Furthermore,I did observe several commercial aircraft flying that night at approximately 30,000 ft.I could see them coming towards me at a distance and could clearly see the strobes flashing.I even watched them as they passed and could see a visible flashing light until they were out of sight. The objects I observed were flying VERY high above the normal air traffic. I can only estimate them at about 100,000 ft conservatively.If they were in fact commercial aircraft, they were moving at very high speed for that altitude.The second object I saw was in the same flight path as the first,about 10 minutes later. I watched this second object(which also looked like any other star)coming towards me, and when it was directly overhead,it vanished.It just wasn't there any longer.I looked in the direction it was going for several more minutes and could not see any movement.Shortly after the object vanished,I saw a very brief shooting star or fireball headed in the opposite direction just North of where the object was last seen.Needless to say,I was very curious as to what they might have been,and wondered if one of those stars were watching me watching it.;40.1349380952382;-75.3543206349205
Bright red and orange, large with clear edges light ball.;2019-09-22 23:05:00;15-20 seconds;Bright red and orange, large with clear edges light ball. I was standing on the backyard of my house. I've noticed a red, large, round light moving from behind the tree from west towards the east.  It was a very bright red ball with a hint of the orange and yellow inside.  The shape of it was slightly elongated towards the direction it was moving to. Initially it was moving slow and it was large and clear.  I would compare the size of it to the soccer ball held on the stretched out arm. There was no sound. It started moving faster with growing distance.  By the time I ran into the house and grabbed my phone if was disappearing.  I took a short video but it seems like a star.;40.1349380952382;-75.3543206349205
I saw two lights that looked like stars or aircraft flying in formation to the northwest when I walked outside to at around 5:55 am EST;2021-01-24 05:55:00;<1 minute;I saw two lights that looked like stars or aircraft flying in formation to the northwest when I walked outside to at around 5:55 am EST. I observed them for a minute trying to figure out what the were, thinking military craft because I could see they were slowly moving in formation. I leaned over (to put something down) looked up again and they were completely gone. They were slightly bluish like Sirius or Venus and about the brightness of Venus, or slightly less bright. This is my first actual UFO sighting.;40.1349380952382;-75.3543206349205
