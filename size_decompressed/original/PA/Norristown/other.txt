4 red balls of light blinking.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-06 22:00:00;>10 minutes;4 red balls of light blinking. While unloading my trunk of shopping bags, I noticed 4 blinking lights in the horizon towards the Elmwood Zoo area.  The lights were all red in a curved line blinking in no specific order.  Looks like the lights could have been the side of a saucer shape, but I did not see a craft.  I watched for a few minutes then went inside and told my husband.  A few minutes later he  came outside and looked acknowledged what I saw and wanted to go back in.  I often  sky gaze looking for the most mysterious things but he could not deny this one.  They were not that high either, maybe as high as a helicopter or a drone plane which I had seen twice in the last month locally here.  I have never seen drone planes here before.  It could have been a tall structure that I don't know about, but I doubt it.   I have lived here for 3 years, and have never seen the lights before.  Also it was a very clear night sky with a big bright moon, very cool. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
