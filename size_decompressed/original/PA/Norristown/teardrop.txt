PD));2010-07-01 22:00:00;8 hours;Teardrop bright light shaped craft seen in Norristown 6-29-10 and every night after at 10pm. I have a tear drop shaped craft/bright light appear every night around 10pm EST.  At first I thought it was just a star.   A few days later I noticed how bright it was and how low it was.  Planes flew above it several times.   I used binocluars to make out the shape.  It's really bright and teardrop shaped.  This started June 10th and had accured every night since.  Only one night did I see it move.  Thats when I decided to report this.  That really spooked me a bit. 6-29-10 was the only time I saw it move.  I jumped in my car and followed it.  When it was flying I heard no sounds at all and the light seemed to change to a strobe looking light in the middle and appeared to have solid lights around the perimeter of the craft.  It appeared to stop at  times and change direction fast.  I followed it down to main street in Norristown where it appeared to hover for a while.  It also appeared much lower in altitude once it reached main street.  This for sure needs to be looked into.   I have ten or so witnesses including myself. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus in wnw sky?
