Unusual triangular craft.;2012-12-13 22:00:00;10 minutes;Unusual triangular craft. This was the night of the meteor shower.  It was about 10:00 p.m. on a clear night.  I watched a craft that was triangular in shape hover in one spot.  The white lights on the craft made that shape pretty clear.  It hovered for only two minutes that I saw before it moved up, tilted 30 degress, then slowly traveled straight.  It was silent.  Then the front light dimmed as it traveled.  My mother and I saw this.  Then my husband saw it.  It did not move in a way a conventional air craft would, it was silent, and no blinking light like and airplane or helicopter. It was very hard to judge the size and altitude.;40.1349380952382;-75.3543206349205
