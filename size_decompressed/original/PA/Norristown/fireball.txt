Objects in western sky at sunset with a forked tail.;2012-11-12 17:00:00;10 minutes;Objects in western sky at sunset with a forked tail. This happens happens every night around sunset, and predictably at sunrise, because that is when the objects are visible.  They resemble commets.  They are always in the western sky with a forked tail southern direction.  They appear to be stationary and can appear out of no where.  They are not air planes.  I usually see 5 to 10 at a time.  I am wondering why no body is talking about this.  My husband and I can see them like clock work.  They are different colors depending on the sunset.
