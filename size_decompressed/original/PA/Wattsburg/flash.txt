My brother and I were spotlighting for deer on a side road out in Wattsburg, PA and noticed a series of flashes to our right.  I couldn’t see the actually aircraft but I did see three distinct flashes followed by a phishew like sound.  This happened within a few seconds and a few more seconds later it happened again a bit farther down the road.  We drove to try to get a better look but we could find them.  There wasn’t a jet stream or anything.  We thought it was some sort of military aircraft but after doing some research online I decided that if it was a military aircraft then it is top secret and not publically acknowledged.  Unfortunately I couldn’t make out the shape or color of the object but there was a sort of glow that went from a yellowish hue to a more blue color as it flashed away.   This is the first such encounter with UFOs and am quite interested to get any information regarding UFOs or UFO sightings.;42.0381;-79.8342
