Two unidentified flying objects traveling at incredible speeds changing course;2012-05-28 18:00:00;3 minutes;Two unidentified flying objects traveling at incredible speeds changing course I was smoking a cigarette and gazing into the night sky.   It was a very clear night except for one cloud the stood in the middle.  I whitnessed a unidentified flying object which resembled a star. It was movong at a high velocity due north.  It was not a plane because it was too far away and moving at an incredible speed. It was a constant light. Resembled a star. The object that was headed due north got lost behind the cloud.  I watched and waited for it to reveal itself when i thought i saw it headed due east. It wasnt even traveling in a straight line.  It's course seemed curved.  Thats when i noticed a second unidentified flying object flying out of the same cloud and this object was headed also due east.  No other object came out of the cloud and both objects looked like moving stars in the sky traveli.g twice... maybe three times the speed of a commerical aircraft.  This event was observed may 28th 2012 above waynesburg pa.;39.8939;-80.1773
Bright light surrounded by jets.;2012-10-12 17:45:00;1 minute;Bright light surrounded by jets As we were heading south on Interstate 79 to Morgantown, WV, we saw six jets crisscrossing the sky  and noticed a bright white light hovering in the sky in between the jets.  It looked like the aircraft were surrounding the object. The light hovered for a minute and then suddenly disappeared.  The jets remained for several minutes more and then took off.  This was in the south western PA area, approximately between the area a few miles north of Waynesburg and the northern panhandle of West Virginia (south of 70/west of 79).;39.8939;-80.1773
