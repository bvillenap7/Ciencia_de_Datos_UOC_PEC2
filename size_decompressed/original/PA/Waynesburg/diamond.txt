I was 16. My sister was 14. 3 orange objects were spotted off of our deck as the sun set. They were east of our location. (east of Waynesburg, Pa. ). They were near the horizon some 4-5 miles distant. They were lined up horizontally above a distant hill. I ran into house to give our male adult babysitter binoculars because he couldn't believe his eyes. when I returned, the objects were gone. He said they took off in a northerly direction. Just miniutes later 2 Apache military helicopters flew right over our home in the direction of the sighting. It was very exciting. They were at a very low altitude. I will never forget the events of this evening and will forever be inclined to believe that something was out there very wierd and otherworldly. I was prompted to file this report because I was told there is the slight chance that some one else, perhaps one of my neighbors also saw what we did that evening and so I decided to write this.;39.8939;-80.1773
Diamond craft in SW Pa.;2014-02-27 02:24:00;20 minutes;Diamond craft in SW Pa. On February 27, I was getting ready to go to bed and I happened to look out the window of my downtown Waynesburg apartment.  Above the First National Bank building something caught my eye.  There are several towers from the energy industry around but they are predominantly stationary and more to the far left of my window. I thought the object was weird because it did not have the appropriate lights for an airplane or helicopter.  As I peered closer, I saw it was a diamond shaped craft, with an undulating pulse of green, red and blue lights.  It moved slowly in a circular motion but for the most part just hovered. The next morning, I double checked to make sure they didn't just put another tower up and beheld that above the bank building and in the distance, there are no towers viewable.;39.8939;-80.1773
