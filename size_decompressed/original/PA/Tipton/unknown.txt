On the evening of July 5, 2,004 while looking through binoculars at the evening stars I noticed a white dot in motion.  It was not an airplane as I had just seen a small aircraft with red blinking wing lights just before observing the white dot moving. I watched it through binoculars for about a half minute.  It was not a meteor streak, but was moving in a line, not darting up or down, but just moving from my left to my right. It may have been a satalite but was in my opinion definitly not an aircraft as we know it to be seen at night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));40.634;-78.3048
