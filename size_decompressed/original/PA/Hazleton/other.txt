On the evening of Wednesday, June 19, 2013,  I was leaving my home to go to work.  I went around the back of my home to where I always park my car.  As I approached my car, I noticed a very bright object high in the western sky.  It appeared to be moving very, very slowly…so slowly in fact, it could almost pass for a star.  I stopped to look at the object one more time before entering my car. This is when I noticed that the object was sort of cone shaped in the front and to the rear of the direction of its travel.  The brightness increased as it got closer to me.  It turned from a dim white to a very bright whitish yellow.  Once inside of my car, I opened the “moon roof” to get another view of the object while letting my car to warm up.  After about two minutes of observing this thing, the object was almost directly over me.  Its speed increased dramatically as it flew overhead.  What made this thing so strange is that it made no noise and it had no navigation (red/white blinking) lights on.  The only thing that I can think of that this object may have been is the ISS. It maintained a very lateral or horizontal line of travel. The object appeared as if it had a super extended cone of light to the forward and aft position of its travel.  Anyway, after maybe a couple of more minutes, the object settled into the eastern sky and disappeared over the horizon.  Except for the cone shapes in the front and back of the object, it resembled a regular satellite in the night sky (only much bigger) or even the ISS.;40.9488284210526;-75.9640115789475
