Two objects seen flying over Hazleton, PA in a northern direction.;2020-08-11 23:40:00;10 seconds;Two objects seen flying over Hazleton, PA in a northern direction. I was sitting outside at app. 11:30 PM DST, hoping to observe some meteors from the Perseid meteor shower.  At about 11:40 PM, I happened to get a glimpse of an object moving south to north, against the direction I was expecting to see meteors.  At first I thought it might be a satellite, but quickly realized it was moving way too fast to be one.  I stood up to get a better view of this fast moving object, then quickly noticed a second object trailing the first object, same relative speed, same relative direction.  As I watched, the trailing object overtook the first object, shooting slightly ahead of it, then slowing slightly in order to be flying adjacent to the first object.  The spacing of the two objects was about the width of a fist held at arms length. When the two objects were adjacent to each other, they then veered slightly into a northeast direction, flying in this `formation' until flying out of sight.  The total duration of this event was about 10 seconds.  These two objects were the same relative size, slightly larger than a common satellite viewed from Earth, moving way too fast to be satellites.  I listened to hear any jet sounds, if any existed, but no sound was heard.;40.9488284210526;-75.9640115789475
