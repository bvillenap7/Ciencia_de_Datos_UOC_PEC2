Buzzed by UFO;1974-03-15 19:30:00;30minutes;Buzzed by UFO Round saucer with domed top. Silver-gray with white lights.  I was 17 and pregnagnt for my first child, my boyfriend and I were walking the railroad tracks from Moosic to Avoca.  As we approached a railroad bridge that crossed over the tracks we were on I saw a bright light comming from the right.  I asked my boyfriend what he thought, he wasnt sure, we went under the bridge and came out the other side (aprox, 40 feet).  The object was almost over head, I could clearly see a long hose or cable like rope hanging from the craft just above the power/phone lines. As it approached the bridge the line silently went back into the craft.  The craft had rows of lights around its middle line and underneath, they appeared to rotate giving a spinning illusion, the craft was not spinning just hovering. It had a clear row of windows in the dome and there were forms moving inside.  Underneath it had three holes with large possable propeller like or fan like blades that were spinning. The intire area was lit up like daytime. I stood there in awe, for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then craft than tilted up to about the position of 2 on a clock and took off.  The whole time there wasnt a sound, no wind, nothing.  My boyfriend was terrified and wanted to hide, I knew they had already seen us and where would I hide from something that big. There is a little ligue field not far from there, if that craft were sitting on the pitchers mound all sides would touch a base.  When we reached our destination in Avoca it was 9:30 pm  about two hours had past, the walk should have taken no less than a half hour. Later when I return home I told my dad and we called the local airport to see if they saw anything on radar, we were laughed at, so for the past 32 years this has been my secret.
