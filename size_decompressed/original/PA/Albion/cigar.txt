Was silent, seen by two customers of mine, who are not UFO buffs;1997-07-01 13:00:00;15 minutes;Was silent, seen by two customers of mine, who are not UFO buffs was moving very slowly (no more than 2 mph) made no sound (I have seen blimps they can be heard for miles) was approx 1000 feet long was approx 1 to 2 miles away was definitely not a blimp, sky was clear no clouds was watched by two people for 15 minutes was seen to the west moving north I am not sure the two people who saw it would want to have their names released since one owns a business and does not need to be perceived as a nut They told me the day they saw it since they know I am very interested in UFOs. I was not sure I should report this because I did not see it personally;41.8896;-80.3125
