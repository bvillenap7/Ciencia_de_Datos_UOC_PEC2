Light over the Delaware.;2014-02-14 05:45:00;1 hour;Light over the Delaware. The object looks like a star but there are no stars out because of the recent snowstorm we currently had.  If there are any they are not this bright.   The object seems to float there and it's not an airplane because it has remained stagnate for at least 30 min and more.  The light on it is bright and there looks as if there's another light going around it.  It is not a helicopter because of the wind and it would still be moving in someway or another.   There is only one and its shape is hard to tell since it's just one light but looks there are multiple lights moving around it.   A little about the observer is that I have never seen a UFO and not really a believer in aliens but I felt like this needed to reported to possibly help support someone else's observation.   Also I wanted to be able to report this because it looks out of the ordinary and wanted to share it.;39.8545;-75.3773000000001
