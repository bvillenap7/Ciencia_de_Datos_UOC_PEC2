Black cylinder, no windows, no motor, no wings,no writing;2012-02-01 14:00:00;daytime;Black cylinder,no windows, no motor,no wings,no writing I was driving eastbound on I-80. Around 4:00 p.m. a black cylinder appeared on my passenger side of vehicle. The weather was sunny but cold out.The black cylinder flew across all 4 lanes of highway. This cylinder was all black.  The cylinder was about 1/2 mile in sky to my estimate.  The object was close enough to me that I could tell it was metal looking,not even close to a blimp. It did not have wings, motor,windows, landing gear,or writing on it. I'm driving trying to observe all details on it.I look to see if other drivers are seeing this.  I was by myself could'nt get a picture with cell phone.The lenght seem to be 70 feet or more my estimate. The cylinder disappears over the horizon and a jet appears. Flying same direction and height as black cylinder the jet seemed to be chasing it. The black cylinder flew a straight path and not super sonic speed.This caught me off guard I knew I had to observe as much detail as I could.  This took place on 2/1/12.On I-80 ! eastbound a little ways back before Penfield, Pa exit. I wish I would have got a picture of this thing.  Can't even figure out how it was flying or what it was. This caught all drivers off guard.  Didn't notice any body pulling off side of road to take picture.I estimate this took about total of 3 minutes during the appearance of black cylinder. The black cylinder was flying from my right side towards my left side accross highway.;41.2045;-78.5788
