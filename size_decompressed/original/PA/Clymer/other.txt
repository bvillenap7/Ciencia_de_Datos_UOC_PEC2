While attending a late summer picnic at a friend's farm in August of 1996 I witnessed the appearance of a bullet shaped craft travelling southwest to northeast in a beautiful and clear, cloudless sky, with 8 other people.   The others looked up but did not want to believe me that this was a classic and very real ufo!  They tried to explain it away as a balloon or blimp of some kind, even though there was no gondola attached and the object moved purposefully in a very straight line.   The craft was approximately 500 to 1000 ft high and I'm estimating that it was about the size of a standard passenger bus.  It was metallic, shiny and reflected the sun on it's surface but it was a semi-dull shine, and not of mirror reflecting quality.   On the surface of the object were two lines that seperated it into 3 sections:  pointed nose section, middle and rear.  There were no other distinguising features on the object either no windows or door apertures could be seen.   When the object passed us overhead we had a clear view of the back which was round, perfectly smooth and also featureless no exhaust could be seen, No motor or propeller could be seen either and no sound at all - it was completely silent.   An amazing sight, to be sure, and one which I will never forget.;40.6691;-79.0139
