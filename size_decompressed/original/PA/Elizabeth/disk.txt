saucer shape seen from bottom with triangular lights with point in center, grey in shape.300' up.;2003-10-15 19:15:00;5 minutes;saucer shape seen from bottom with triangular lights with point in center, grey in shape.300' up. 14 year old daughter and 2 friends in backyard at dusk and seen a light coming from over the woods. then it was over the house creeping slow. they ran into the garage screeming and my other daughter 14 yrs old (twin) then joined them and they all looked up to see a grey saucer about 4 telephone poles high creeping along right above the house it had lights in a triangle shape without a bottom on the triangle at the edge of the saucer. kinda like this ^, they drew a picture. I (dad) came home from work and they were shaking and crying. visibly upset. i believe they saw something unexplained. i teased the twins because it was their birthday, i told them their REAL parents just stopped by to wish them a happy birthday! my kids are not into drugs or anything like that. and they wouldn't make this up and react the way they did. i ask them is it spun, they said no. i ak them if there was wind or noise. they said no wind but a whirring type noise.;40.2659;-79.8517
