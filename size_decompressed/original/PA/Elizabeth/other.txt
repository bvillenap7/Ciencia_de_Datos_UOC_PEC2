Dark shiny disk that appeared to be on fire;2008-07-25 22:00:00;5-7 minutes;Dark shiny disk that appeared to be on fire Waiting for the local fireworks to start at 10pm, in the opposite direction 3 of us saw this object in the sky. There was only one. It looked flat like a dish, was shiny but dark on the bottom of it and it had an orange glow like a plane on fire. We waited to hear an explosion or for it to drop out of the sky. There was no sound and the fireworks were not ready to start yet. It made a wide turn and got smaller until it was an orange dot then disappeared. I'm not sure if anyone else around saw it or not. It was about the size of an airplane when it's close enough to see windows, if that makes sense. It hovered for a good 5 minutes until it finally started to turn away from us and slowly disappeared. The sky was dark and there were hardly any clouds.;40.2659;-79.8517
