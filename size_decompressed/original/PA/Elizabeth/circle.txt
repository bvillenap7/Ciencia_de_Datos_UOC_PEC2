My son and husband  spotted a round  object on fire above their car   - they pointed it out and  opened sun roof to watch it  -it then flickered off and on and then went out. they pulled over and watched  for a minute.   They then drove to our house 2 blocks away - still watching object and pulled in drive way and yelled for myself.  We then all watched  the round object move vertically across the sky.  It was silent and had no lights.   The neighbor kid watched it too.    It was dark and round, and easily visible.
