Zigzag UFO Trails Space X and Becomes a Star in Sky;2020-03-01 05:45:00;2 minutes;Zigzag UFO Trails Space X and Becomes a Star in Sky After the Space X (I presume) long line of 40 plus micro satellites went by in a south/southeast direction, it was trailed by a satellite looking dot that was moving differently.  It seemed separate from the Space x line but traveling with it.  It moved differently, not fixed, wobbling, and in a zigzag pattern.  It moved following the line of satellites, up and away in a mountain peak path and came back down, past and below the line where it hovered in one place again, became brighter and brighter.  Then just was like a star sitting in the sky.  I don't know if it is normal to hear space x, but I could hear what sounded like a jet in the middle of its passing.  The sound was dissapating after it passed when the other object came trailing and zigzagging behind.  Not sure if this is normal/attached to Space x or separate.;39.7704;-76.5979
