My friend and I were sitting outside, and it was about 8:30 P.M. It was a clear night, and you could see the stars. Suddenly a green mass was in the air. It was huge. I estimated that it was 15 miles away. It glowed a brilliant green and illuminated the sky for a few seconds. I guessed that it was a meteor, but meteors don't glow green. It startd streaking down the sky. Unlike a meteor, it did not burn out. It hit the ground,sending a brilliant green flash into the sky, and then it was gone.;39.7704;-76.5979
