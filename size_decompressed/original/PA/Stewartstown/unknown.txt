Round Shape Possibly  3-4 hrs  3 very bright lights at different parts of the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus, Jupiter, and Mercury?  PD));2008-12-29 18:00:00;4-5 hours;12/29/2008  Stewartstown, PA.  Round Shape Possibly  3-4 hours  3 very bright lights at different parts of the sky Very bright craft observed approximately 1,500 ft- 5,000 ft above town center. Brightly shaped craft has been observed by many co-workers for about 3-4 months off and on.  Last night 12/29/2008 at approximately 20:00 hrs. I observed 3 craft hovering in the distance all at various heights of around 1,500 ft to 5,000 ft.  They were hovering in the Southern, Southwestern, and Northwestern sky separated from one another of about 2-10 miles apart as a best guess.  At these heights I would guess they could have been the size of a commercial airliner if not smaller.  Obviously they were not, nor exibited typical flying aeronautics of Earthly aircraft.  Considerly the earth rotates along with the moon moving, these craft were observed at different heights as well as different locations throughout the evening. The closet craft exhibited the well known wobbling effect.  I've read numerous books on UFO sitings from Britain. Ireland,  The United States and around the world.  I consider myself well versed on the subject from Dr. Mackey and other physicists who believe in the fact that craft are indeed originating from other worlds. The shape and size were difficult to ascertain, although they appeared extremely bright, too bright to be a planet or star in addition to their movements.  Thank you for allowing me to document these incidents. ((NUFORC Note:  Given the duration of the sighting, together with the description of the appearance of the objects, I suspect that the first possibility to be ruled out would be stars and planets.  However, I cannot be certain.  PD));39.7704;-76.5979
