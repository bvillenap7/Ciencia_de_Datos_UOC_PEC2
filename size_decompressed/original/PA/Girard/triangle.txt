Gray triangle with large dim lights on each point.;2019-12-19 18:10:00;8 Seconds;Gray triangle with large dim lights on each point. Shortly after entering our hot tub on Thursday evening (12/19/19), my wife saw what she described as a triangular shaped object move rapidly east to west across the sky.  She said it was gray in color with large glowing lights at each point. It traveled in a straight line and was visible for approximately 6 seconds. Three nights later (12/22/19) we were in the tub again.  A few minutes after entering the tub my wife yelled “There’s something in the sky!  There’s something in the sky!” this time I saw it too. She described it as a boomerang shaped object with smaller glowing lights. It was visible for about 5 seconds. I was unable to discern a shape myself, but could see the dimly lit lights. The odd thing about it, aside from the experience itself, is that these sightings were almost at the exact same time each night (18:10).  The sightings were at night with a clear star lite sky behind them.  These objects did not make any noticeable sound.;41.9914;-80.3141
