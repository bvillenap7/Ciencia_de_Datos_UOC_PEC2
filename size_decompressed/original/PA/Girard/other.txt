A large elongated octagon shape with scattered lights floated overhead, heading north/northwest. It appeared as a shadow against the night sky and covered almost all of the area between the stars Pollex and Alhena. There was no way to compare the height at which it was traveling. No sound. It reminded me of a floating city of lights.;41.9914;-80.3141
