I was outside with my dog when this craft zipped over my head. I am not sure how long I saw it for but it was moving very fast. The craft looked like an oval, and it was a very dark grey color.  It was like a matte grey.  It looked like the craft was flying almost 1,000 ft.  My dog seemed to notice it.  I wish to remain anonymous.  Thanks.;40.8621;-75.8284
I saw three oval shaped crafts flying very slowly about 20,000 feet.;2019-06-26 20:30:00;Several Minutes;I saw three oval shaped crafts flying very slowly about 20,000 feet. I was sitting on my back porch when I noticed a shape in the sky.  I inspected the shape further and then I noticed two more objects accompanying it.  I reported a similar experience of mine I experienced something similar in June, however this time these shapes were at a much higher altitude.  I believe that they were above 20,000 feet.  I was observing the shapes for several minutes until I lost sight of them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.8621;-75.8284
