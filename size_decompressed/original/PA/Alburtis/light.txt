Son came running out of house telling us about orange light in sky behind our house.   We ran to the side of the house to see the light.  There it was in the night sky. Orange and then just like that it was gone.   Then it came back to the south.  About 20 sec and then that fast was gone again.;40.5182;-75.6039
