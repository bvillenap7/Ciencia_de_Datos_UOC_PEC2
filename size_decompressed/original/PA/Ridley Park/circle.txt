Round white light above the clouds moving in a circular pattern over and over again very fast.  It was brightest behind the clouds.  Too fast for any aircraft.  It stopped when clouds cleared and came back when they re appeared.  At the end it was just a flash of light passing through one cloud repeatedly in a straight line...like the cloud had a pulsing light inside it.;39.8771;-75.3235
