Blue light object falls from sky 10/12/12 PA;2012-10-12 22:00:00;15 seconds;Blue light object falls from sky 10/12/12 PA It was night time around 10:00 PM when I was using the basement bathroom. The light was out so that no one could see through the window and I had a clear view of the dark, night sky. I saw a a bright, blue, blinking light, whose lights were oriented like an airplane's.  It did not slowly descend from the sky like a landing airplane, but quickly shot down at a sharp angle from the sky and seemed to land, although I did not see it land. But it did not shoot straight across the sky. It wasn't abnormally fast, but it was FAR faster than an airplane or helicopter. It was like a blue glowing jet fell from the sky into the ground. A real airplane followed the path of the object but did not descend. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.8771;-75.3235
