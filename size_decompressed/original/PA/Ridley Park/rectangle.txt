Appeared as white, two story building shaped object, no wings, moving slowly at low altitude.;2006-09-28 13:00:00;1 minute;Appeared as white, two story building shaped object, no wings, moving slowly at low altitude. Clear sky, while driving, I saw what appeared to be a large two story building, wide as a full moon, white with windows, no wings, moving east slowly over treetops on horizon. Disappeared from view as I proceeded north, when I got to my destination, a few minutes later, I saw it again, quite clearly, in the east, moving south. This was near the Philadelphia International Airport, so I searched the news for reports, thinking perhaps that it was a new type of blimp. Nothing.  I’m 59 years old and I’ve never seen anything like it before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));39.8771;-75.3235
