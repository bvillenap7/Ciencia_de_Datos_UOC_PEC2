Figured it was from the clouds.  It came back in full brightness, dimmed again and moved towards the northeast.  The light stopped blinking and went to a white light, went up a bit then disappeared.  Another bright light appeared to the bottom left of the first light.  It flew up, then dimmed out.  Weather was partly cloudy and humid.;40.5488;-75.9874

I had a clear view of a firework show that was a distance away.  I noticed a solid red light sitting still above the mountain to the left of the fireworks.  Living in an area surrounded by mountains, I just assumed the red light was an airplane signal tower and thought nothing of it.   As soon as the fireworks ended the red light started travelling in a straight line to the right at a pretty fast speed.  Another firework then went off and without stopping or slowing down, the red light changed directions and moved to the left.  The light then slowly changed to a bright green then back to red before disappearing.  It seemed to be watching the firework show.;40.5488;-75.9874
