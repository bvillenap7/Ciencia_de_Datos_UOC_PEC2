Fireball object falling from the sky.;2014-01-04 01:55:00;1-2 minutes;Fireball object falling from the sky. With my boyfriend's dad to pick my boyfriend up from work, we both noticed it at the same time.  We thought it was a shooting star at first, but the object was much too large and moving way too slow, like it was falling to the earth.;40.5166620689655;-78.3992655172414
Roman candle-like fireball streaking across Altoona sky.;2014-12-03 20:00:00;2-3 seconds;Roman candle-like fireball streaking across Altoona sky. Was on Plank Road by Wal-mart traveling north-west towards Altoona.  Suddenly a bright, large blue-white 'fireball' shot across the sky in front of me, appearing to come from a large cloud, shooting down at about a 15 degree slope from the horizon, traveling west.  I estimate whatever it was landed near the Logan Township/ Newburg area, or possibly even farther past the mountain.  Did not make a sound.  It was only visible for around 2-3 seconds before disappearing.  Was very disappointed I didn't have time to capture video. I would describe it as looking like a large bluish Roman candle.  It is quite possible that this was some sort of firework, but I've never seen a Roman candle that was large enough to be visible from that distance and also shot down from the sky.  Also I didn't see any other lights or fireworks aside from the 'fireball' previously mentioned.;40.5166620689655;-78.3992655172414
Strange Fireball with no Sound and Pausing in the night sky.;2015-07-03 22:03:00;3 minutes;Strange Fireball with no Sound and Pausing in the night sky. My brother and I just step of out of our cars and happen to look up and saw a RED and ORANGE ball of flame passing by from the North side and heading down to South side of Altoona, Pa.  Looks like it came traveling by Tyrone ,Pinecroft and end in Altoona, PA and then shooting up to Space.   Strange things is that made it as ufo sighting is: it was moving slowly in straight path then it stop for a 15 seconds then to start to move again in same straight path. then stop again for 5 second before shooting up with no sound or explosion. Never in my seem something like that. I know its not a firework or craft in fire. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above, and reposted on July 10, 2015.
