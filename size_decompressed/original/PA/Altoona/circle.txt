I was at Prospect Park in Altoona with a friend of mine to hang out.  It was early in the evening. We started walking through the park and decided to play around.  We got started getting rough and wrestling around.   He was holding me down when I happened to look up.  He was facing the opposite direction I was, when I saw an object in the air pretty low.  It was too low to be a plan or such. I knew it wasn't a satellite either.  After a couple seconds of looking and focusing it became clearer. It was a round saucer that looked silver at first until it started giving off a glow of white light.  I immediately tried to get my friends attention. I yelled his name, he proceeded in trying to hold me down, I yelled it again and got his attention. I told him to look where I was pointing. He had something in his eye, he took a second to clear it up while I was yelling look!  look!  He finally looked up. But couldn't see it at first for a moment. I was looking at it the whole time.  It was going a little slow at first as it was when I first seen it.  It was heading over our direction over us.  It kept the same level the whole time in the air.  My friend finally caught it and was watching to as it just started to go faster.  At that point it was only visible as it was going faster until it took a tremendous increase in speed and just warped into disappearing into the distance.  My friend saw it at the last moment, but however he did seen it for the 15 seconds he did.  I don't know if we were the only ones to see it in the area.  Another one of my friends was walking by the park fence moments after the sighting happened.  I had told her what we just seen. She said that she believed me, but I don't know.  I have told a very limited number of people about this. I don't care who believes me or who doesn't.  The fact is, I know what I seen.  I have photographic memory and remember ever detail. It was the most weirdest and incredible experiences in my life so far. ! It sure gave me a new perspective on things.  I never doubted o! ther existences, but I wasn't sure either till that day.

Bright orange big light quiet, appeared to the south moved across the sky & got dimmer then dissipated, repeated 5 times over 1/2 hour.;2019-07-17 22:00:00;30 minutes;Bright orange big light quiet, appeared to the south moved across the sky & got dimmer then dissipated, repeated 5 times over 1/2 hour. I saw an orange light pretty bright & big sort of just appeared at a point south of my house moved across the sky towards the north, after a couple minutes kept getting less bright then sort of dissipated, no sound at all.  At first I thought it was a big plane or a drone, but then another appeared at the same spot and moved across the sky and again after a few minutes it got weaker and dissipated around the same area to the north like the other one had.   I got my wife out of the house and she watched it happen 3 more times with me, we both were confused at what we were seeing.  This happened 5 times over about 30 minutes then it stopped.;40.5166620689655;-78.3992655172414
