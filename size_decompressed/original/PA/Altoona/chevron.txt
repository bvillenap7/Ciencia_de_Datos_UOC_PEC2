Lighted chevron shaped object observed.;2004-04-09 22:10:00;12-15 seconds;Lighted chevron shaped object observed. As I got home from a friends I took the dog out in the yard. Movement in the sky caught my eye.I looked up to see a chevron shaped object heading Northwest at what appeared to be at 3 to 4 times the speed of any aircraft I have observed. The object appeared to be at about 1000 ft. At least thats my best guess. It was silent and had 3 rows of dim orange lights, maybe 30 in all, arranged evenly and symetrically. The weather was crystal clear. I lost sight as my veiw became obstucted be the pine trees in my back yard.;40.5166620689655;-78.3992655172414
