My friends and I were walking throught the woods bye my house. My Cousin told us that he thought he saw some lights comming out of the trees behind us. Me and another kid looked back and there was nothing. A few minutes past and the lights that my cousin clameded to see had rison out of the tree's about 25 feet or more in front of us. after we seen it a wind gust blow through wich was strange cause it was one of those dead hot days and, the lights shout striaght up in the air. The lights seemed to disfigure as it rose makeing different shapes. But the shapes were solid curcle sqare etc. They made no noise other then the wind gust blowing the trees and it was extremely bright. We could see it rise up in to the sky for about 10min or so and it just cept getting smaller and smaller. When it first rose out of the trees it looked to be the size of a small one floor house. After a wile if it getting small and going in the air it took a what seemed to be a turn and vanished.;40.5166620689655;-78.3992655172414

They streamed across the sky from the southwest to the northeast, at a very high rate of speed. I thought that they might have been meteors or space junk, but they were so hard to see. If I wasnâ€™t watching an airplane fly over I would have never noticed them. I only saw them for about 5 to 8 seconds.;40.5166620689655;-78.3992655172414

It had no flashing lights but was flying in a straight line across the sky. A few minutes later we saw a second one but it just disappeared when we were watching it in the middle of yhe in sky. Finally we saw a green one that was going up and down and would hover for a few moments the it went forward and then backwards to where in we'd hovering.  It also turned red and would flash red and green. We were unable to see the shape or anything.  We just saw the colors in the sky.;40.5166620689655;-78.3992655172414
