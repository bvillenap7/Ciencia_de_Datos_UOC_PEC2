Large, wingless, cylinder moving through the sky.;2018-10-16 08:25:00;5 minutes;Large, wingless, cylinder moving through the sky. I was walking my son to the bus this morning, when we both saw a large, clean white, pill shaped, wingless object moving through the sky.  Definitely faster than what you would see from a normal plane at that height but slow enough for us to get a good look at it.  Not a lot of cloud cover.  Headed in the Pittsburgh direction (west).;40.5166620689655;-78.3992655172414
