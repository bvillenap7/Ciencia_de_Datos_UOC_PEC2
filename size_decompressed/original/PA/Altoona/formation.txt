Sometime between the hours of 10:15pm and 10:30pm, myself and two friends of mine witnessed a cluster of multi-colored lights in a formation travelling across the sky in what we think was a northeastern direction.   At first we thought it was fireworks, but the formation of lights which seemed to pulsate between shades of blue, red and green traveled across the sky in the same direction until they moved behind the trees and beyond our point of view.   They seemed to be at the same altitude as aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere, and sober-minded.
