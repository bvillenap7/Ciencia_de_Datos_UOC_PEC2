It was right before dusk.  I was out on the porch and I looked out over the porch at the Sam Ray train shop.  Right above the shops I saw this flyng object it was hovering above the trains.  It was flashing colored lightes.  It stayed for a few minutes and left.   My sister was upstairs looking out the window at it. after it left my aunt who lived in the duplex came up the basement into our kitchen and wanted to know who screamed.  We told her nobody she said she heard a scream.   That was the only time i ever saw it.  I asked my sister back in 1997 why she never said anything?  Like you, she said I didn't want anyone to think I was crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.
