Stange Object over Ice Mountain;2002-10-20 19:30:00;5 min or less;Stange Object over Ice Mountain I was doing a little pre-season scouting for deer on Ice Mountain, near Tyrone, PA late Sunday afternoon. I had spent more time out in the woods than I had planned on, and the sun had already set as I made my way back to my Jeep, when I noticed a bright light in the sky moving in my direction. At first I thought it was just an airplane and thought nothing of it. But then it suddenly stopped moving and began to pulsate, getting brighter and then fainter.  I noticed at this time that there appeared to be a slight haze surrounding the object. The pulsating increased in tempo until the object was flickering at a very rapid rate, when suddenly, a bright beam of light shot down from the bottom of the object to the ground below.  This was no searchlight.  Even a well focused searchlight tends to diffuse with distance, but this light was a tight, bright beam from top to bottom. As suddenly as the pulsating began, it stopped, and the beam also turned off.  The object just sat there motionless in the sky.  My Jeep was only about 100 yards away when all this happened, so I ran to it to get my camera.  I took a picture of the object as it hovered, and as I got ready to take another picture the object it began moving around slowly in a tight circle.  I took another picture, but before I could take a third, it suddenly shot straight up in the air at fantastic speed and was gone from sight! I'll attach the two pictures I got to an email message and send them in.  I cropped them down a bit to reduce the file size.  I don't know what this thing was, but I know I've never seen anything like it before!;40.5166620689655;-78.3992655172414
