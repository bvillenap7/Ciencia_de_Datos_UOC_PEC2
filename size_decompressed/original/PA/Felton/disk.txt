What we saw was disk shaped, with different color lights going around on it, oscillating in an unsteady manner, and eventually goes down in the hills.  We all of a sudden saw jets overhead.. not just any jets, but what looked like Air Force jets.  I remember one emergency vehicle going towards the crash area which seemed like a couple miles away,  but we never heard anything about it.
