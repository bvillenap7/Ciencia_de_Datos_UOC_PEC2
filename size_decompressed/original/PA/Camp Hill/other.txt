Sorry, but not computer literate..   I was leaving a football game around 9:15 or before 9:30PM.  I was walking with 3 adults and 2 of my grandchildren (2 and 5) and there were quite a few other people also walking to their cars.  There were patches of clouds that somewhat resembled an old and ripped blanket.  My eyes picked up on 3 lights almost directly above me and moving away from me.  They seemed to resemble a spotlight without the light beaming from the ground.  I excitedly told my group to look at these lights in the sky and I also said, Oh, it's not what I thought this was.  But as I continued to watch them get further away, I noticed 2 other sets of lights join these 3 on each side and then they bolted away... I will also admit none of my group that was only within 2 steps ahead of me heard my excitement.. I thought they all heard me and was looking at what I was seeing, but nobody did...;40.2327632352941;-76.9329102941178
