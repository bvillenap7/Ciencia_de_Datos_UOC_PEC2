White dots moving in a line.;2021-05-08 21:40:00;2 minutes;White dots moving in a line. I came home and parked my car. As I circled behind my car I looked at the stars to the north.  I noticed what looked like 3 stars in a row but they were moving slowly to the east. A fourth dot appeared behind them and traveled in the same path.  As the first dot started fading a fifth appeared.  There were 4-6 visible at any given time. I called my wife out to make sure I wasn't just seeing things and she confirmed that it looked very abnormal and they were moving in a line then would fade out after traveling for 10-15 seconds. We tried to take pictures or videos but our phones could not pick them up. After about two minutes the lead dots started fading and no more appeared.  I watched the sky for a few more minutes and they didn't return.;40.2327632352941;-76.9329102941178
