The spacecraft was seen hovering over Seibert park (a forest in Camp Hill).  I had parked the car and was ((deleted)) outside, when I saw a strange glow and a humming noise above my head. I looked up,and saw an amorphous iridescent shape that was constantly changing, much like a lava lamp.  It disappeared out of thin air, and two more appeared instead of it.  A beam was emitted and it shone on me.  I realized that I had no idea where I was, although I could remember afterwards that I was at least a quarter of a mile from the car I was previously standing next to.  Then it started moving toward my car, where my girlfriend was.  I ran to the car to find her staring at the object.  It hovered for a few seconds before it blew up into a large puff of a smokey substance (although no noise was heard), and the third flew off at an incredibly fast speed.  I waited the whole night to see it again, but it never reappeared.  I finally took my girlfriend home after a long and hard night. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will attempt to have the witness determine the precise date, and will invite him to have his girlfriend submit a report.  PD));40.2327632352941;-76.9329102941178
Hovering Object with White light.;2017-03-11 21:00:00;3 minutes;Hovering Object with White light I was driving and entered a shopping mall parking lot and when leaving I noticed an object to the east.  This was an object that seemed to hover at one point and move in a circle around a certain location.  There was 1 main light which was white and I think there was a smaller red and a white light.  It was similar to an object that I saw on 3/10/17 around about the same time.  That one seemed to have 2 lights like spot lights which seemed to rotate or the object rotated.  Both objects where similar to helicopters but I could say that they were.;40.2327632352941;-76.9329102941178
