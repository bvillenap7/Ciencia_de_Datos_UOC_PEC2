I got my Fiance and we got on our golf cart and went around building it wasn't there we drove to the top of our driveway and we saw the green round hubbering light flying across the driveway down the hill through the neighbors property.  It rested next to a building a=for a few moments and then back and forth it then proceeded towards the field and disappeared.  We went down to the area it was in with our golf cart and there was nothing we came back up the hill to our driveway and there it was in the field next to our pole building not moving.  We started racing towards it and it started moving again we chased it along the farmers field, it stopped like it was looking at us we shined a light on it and it took off again, it never made any noise going through the field.  We chase it and it crossed the street and into the woods and disappeared.   It was a little bigger then a baseball but smaller then a basketba! ll.  It was a bright green hubbering circle. we never seen anything like it before.  I am glad I had someone to witness it with me Just mad that my cell phone was dead and didn't get any pictures.;40.7576;-75.4046
