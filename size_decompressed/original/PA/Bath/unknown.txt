bright glowing light darting across the sky.;2008-01-12 23:00:00;30 sec;bright glowing light darting across the sky. pretty much what had happened was i was in the passanger seat when i looked out my side window and saw a light up in the sky similar to a star but larger than what a normal star would be, this is what caught my attention. we were making a left, at that point we were at a stop sign, the light disapeared for a moment and then reapeared about what looks like 4 feet from down here but up in space is probably miles away from the spot that it had been in just before that. i then tried to tell the driver to stop but we couldnt so i kept my eye on it, it disapeared again and at that point we got into our driveway so i got out and looked up and it had apeared again much much further to the east than it had been just before and then flashed across to my left, its right, at a fast pace that it looked like it had a tail for a moment, then a larger bit of a flash and then it was gone. i waited to see if it would come back for about an hour but that was all i saw of it. it was DEFINITLY some sort of craft, i didnt think of filing a report until i saw about that thing in texas though. maybe their starting to get curious out there!;40.7576;-75.4046
