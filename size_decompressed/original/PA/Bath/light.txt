On my way home from work, cloudy night so no starts in the sky.  A bright flickering light pretty high in the sky stood out due to it being cloudy.   It was flashing an orangish color, seemed stationary and then dimmed and vanished in place.   I was driving so I tried to continue looking in that direction, and it looked like faint sparkling in that area of the sky.  And I thought a saw two smaller orange lights lower to the horizon moving quickly towards where the main light was.;40.7576;-75.4046

I was reading in bed and facing our bedroom window, when I saw this unusually bright green light flying across the sky from E-SE to W-NW from my location.  I saw it for approx. 5 sec. but it may have been seen much longer but it did not come into my view but for the last 5 sec. It was a constant brightness and I described it to my wife, whom was sleeping, as a single firework, but it did not flicker or diminish in brightness. The track was also straight and not an arc. The speed was slower than a shooting star but much faster than any conventional aircraft.  What was really eerie was there was absolutely no sound and the light, just went out and disappeared.  I continued to watch for about 10 min. afterwards but saw nothing else other than a couple jets higher up.;40.7576;-75.4046
