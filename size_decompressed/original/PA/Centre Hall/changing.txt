A mutating fiery flying mass descendes behind mountains;2011-01-11 23:43:00;20 minutes;A mutating fiery flying mass descendes behind mountains It just finished snowing and I looked out my window to see my front yard. I noticed that just above the mountain was a line that was a pale orange color.  I thought at first it was the moon and continued to watch it.  Slowly it chaned from a line to more of a circle.  It moved slightly from side to side and after about ten minutes slowly fell to the mountain and then was gone.   From what I could tell it was a good distance up off the mountain while it was moving and either fell on to the mountain or it descended on the other side of the mountain. I am the only witness I know of.   I am a former penn state student and am enjoying a day off work.  I have never done drugs at haven't had alcohol in my system within a month of this sighting.;40.8282;-77.6714
