Fireball Falls From Sky Bucks County, PA.;2016-01-30 18:00:00;1 minute;Fireball Falls From Sky Bucks County, PA. Fireball fell from the sky burning out behind treeline.   We were in our car (upper Bucks County) traceling West on Ebert Road in Coopersburg, when my son and I witnessed a bright very fast moving ball of fire, falling almost completely straight down.  It happened so fast but was very bright.   Once the light made its way toward the treeline we could no longer see any residual effects.  It just disappeared.   This is on a quiet street, so we lulled over to make sure nothing caught on fire.;40.5035;-75.388
