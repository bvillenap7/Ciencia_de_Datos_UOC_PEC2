4 lights speeding very fast across sky silently;1975-06-30 23:00:00;5 minutes;4 lights speeding very fast across sky silently I saw my own UAP (formally UFO) in the Seventies on the farm.  My then husband and I saw 4 lights, brighter than stars, in a perfect square in the night sky.  Suddenly they zoomed across the sky overhead without a sound, and so fast that they left light streaks in a wavy pattern.  No plane goes that fast..It was 4 separate objects as lights.  I reported it earlier this year because it has haunted me ever since.  It was silent in a very quiet place in rural PA.;41.6979;-76.718
Three silent orange streaks, two in front, one behind traveling at a high rate of speed in the same path.;2004-06-26 22:45:00;5 seconds;Three silent orange streaks, two in front, one behind traveling at a high rate of speed in the same path. Three orange streaks, two ahead of the third, heading in a southern path moving at a very fast speed, but no sound at all. It was clear with a partial bright moon behind where I saw the streaks. I don't beleive in UFO's, but I can't explain whay I saw! ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of re-entering space debris.  PD));41.6979;-76.718
