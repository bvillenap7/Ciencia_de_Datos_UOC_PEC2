unusal obect in the sky;2020-12-06 17:55:00;10 ninutes;unusal obect in the sky ON approx 1547,12/06/2020, While taking my taking out for the evening run, I happened to look at the sky and see what appeared to be a triangle shaped object ahead and above me. It was approx 300 feet in the air. From one side and actually 3 sides,I could see various colors . Those flashing colors were on the 3 sides of the vehicle alternately from each side. I could hear no sound and it was moving at what appeared to be a slow pace. I quickly went into my home to get my cell phone to get a video of this event. I tried to video tape it I did check my phone and it does appear I did catch the object on the camera from a distance. The object eventually came to a complete stop and hovered ,I watched this happen for approx 15 minutes and it was still there when I called in  the report the UFO Reporting Site.
