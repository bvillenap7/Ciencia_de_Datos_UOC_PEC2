I had just picked up my wife from her place of work at Manheim Auto Auction. I turned right onto auction road going west. I then turned right onto Junction Road going north, and in the the sky to the NNW both my wife and I saw a bright white light. The light was approximately 20-30 degrees above the horizon, and I couldn't tell from my vantage point what distance it was from our position. Normally, this is an area where commercial aircraft fly, flying towards Lancaster Regional Airport, so we thought nothing of it until the object split apart in what appeared to be several sections. The time was approximately 17:10 when this event occurred. I said to my wife, did you see that? she said that she did, and asked me if I knew what it was. I told her that I didn't know. When it split apart, it separated into smaller white lights that went left and right from center in a straight line, and then it disappeared. To the right of Junction Road going East is a lot that belongs to Manheim Auto Auction, to the left is holding ponds for water runoff, and directly in front is a few homes, and a shallow wooded area.;40.1705;-76.4166
