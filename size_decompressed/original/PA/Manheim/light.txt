light or round bright object seen in PA.;2008-02-21 02:00:00;5 to 7 mins.;light or round bright object seen in PA. I got up to go to the bathroom about 2am and looked out the window,which I always do if I get up in the night.I saw this light in the sky and thought boy that is a bright star,when all of a sudden it dropped real fast and I thought no, that is a falling star, but then it just stopped and stayed that way for about 15 seconds then shot to the left,stopped again and sort of moved around in a circle for awhile then just shot straight up. I watched it until I couldn't see it anymore.I could also see an airplanes flashing lights comming in from the south the whole time I was watching this.The airplane seemed to be at a higher altitude than the object I was watching. Did anyone else in Pa. see anything similar on Feb,21,2008;40.1705;-76.4166
White lights in sky doing weird moves;2012-11-08 23:35:00;20 minutes;white lights in sky doing weird moves I looked out my patio door before going to bed and noticed all the stars and the little dipper and saw a red streak go across the sky, so I kept looking and saw what I thought was a star drop down real fast and stop and then do a circle.  It stayed still for a few seconds then moved to the right and then up again and stopped. It continued doing circles and moving right and left and then would stay still for a few seconds.  I started looking at all the stars and could pick out three more that were doing the same thing.  I noticed a plane that flew over them.  When the plane flew over they were still.  When the plane was a good distance away they started moving again.I saw another red or orange streak, it was real fast. I went to call my sister for her to look at them and when I went back to look again I could only find one.  Watched it for about 5 seconds and it moved up real fast and stopped.  It is now almost even with the handle on the little dipper and doing circl! es.  It doesn't change colors,stays like a white light.;40.1705;-76.4166
Light traveling very quickly - seemed too fast to be a satellite.;2013-07-06 22:10:00;45 seconds;Light traveling very quickly - seemed too fast to be a satellite. Was watching fireworks when we saw a light traveling across the sky from the South heading directly North.   I assumed it was a satellite at first, but I had never seen one travel anywhere near the speed it was traveling.  I even used my SkyView app on my phone and it didn't have anything marked.  It traveled horizon to horizon in around 30-45 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.1705;-76.4166

She said that the light was bright, and that she then witnessed the light take a sharp downward ark.  She said that the light did not break apart, but just simply arked down in an Easterly direction before she lost sight of the object due to multiple building obstruction.;40.1705;-76.4166
