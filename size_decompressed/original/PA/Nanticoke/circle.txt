Bright white light not shining at anything just floating;2019-10-17 05:20:00;2 minutes;Bright white light not shining at anything just floating I was on my way to work on october 17th, I was driving on interstate 81 going south. I had just passed the exit/interchange between I-81 & I-80.I came around the curve after the interchange to a long straight away around mile maker 140, where there is a straight away heading towards a mountain. I then saw a extremely bright glowing white light hovering in front of the mountain about halfway up the mountain. This bright object was neither on the mountain nor was it shining a light at the mountain, it was just hovering in front of the mountain about halfway between the peak and base. There are no homes in the area and consists of only trees. I continued to stare at the object because I had never seen a light in that part of the mountain, and honestly have never seen a light as bright as this object. The object then proceeded to shoot to the left at an incredible speed and then immediately shot into the air faster than any object I have ever seen. It was gone w! ithin a fraction of a second. I have looked for that light every day since the event hoping to see it again, so i would be able to rationalize that it was some sort of manmade object, to no avail.;41.1947;-76.0078
