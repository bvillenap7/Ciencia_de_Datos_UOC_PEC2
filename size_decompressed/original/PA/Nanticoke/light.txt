10+ red-orange orbs in sky;2012-06-24 00:00:00;1-2 minutes;10+ red-orange orbs in sky My mother and I were planning to go out and she went to prepare something in the car. After a minute she came in the house and called me to tell me there was something in the sky. I found that very odd and ran down the stairs to go outside to check it out. There were ten or more red-orange orbs in the sky. My mother told me that there were even more  before she called me. Very strange. My brother followed me, and I went to call my father. By the time he got there, about all of them had 'disappeared' except one, which stayed there for a prolonged period of time before disappearing. I reported this also here:  http://www.ufostalker.com/ufostalker/UFO+Sighting+in+Nanticoke+Pennsylvania+United+States+on+June+10th+2012/39163, and I've found that there were other people in the area who have witnessed this. My brother tried to record it on his phone but couldn't get the video to work. I'm now keeping my camcorder with me in case I see anything.;41.1947;-76.0078
