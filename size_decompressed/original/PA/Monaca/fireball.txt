I looked up into a clear sky and saw through the trees what looked like an orange fire ball.   I walked toward it and thought it was a plane on fire.  It looked to be about 10,000 feet in the air heading south toward the Pittsburgh International Airport.  I ran in the house and yelled to my husband to come out and see this and that I thought a plane was on fire.
