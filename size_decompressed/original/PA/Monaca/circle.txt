Circular objects over Beaver County.;2016-06-18 21:09:00;4 minutes;Circular objects over Beaver County. On the evening of June 18th, at approximately 9:09 pm, I witnessed 6 circular objects in the sky.  These objects seemed to be floating around in a cluster.  They appeared as a solid dark color.   These objects stayed in a realitively close cluster the whole time visible.   I observed the objects in the north western sky for roughly 4 minutes, until they complexity vanished.  They did not go over a hill or disappear on the horizon, the objects simply went from being in view, to not being there.;40.6718;-80.2917
