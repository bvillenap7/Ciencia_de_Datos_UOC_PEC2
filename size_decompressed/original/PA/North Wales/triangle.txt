I saw an very, very large green light headed my direction, getting louder and louder as it came.  The object then proceeded to stop and hover near the middle of my street.   After about 20 seconds, I noticed a red light on the side of the green one.   The aircraft then made a hundred and eighty degree turn, and the lights spread apart.   It stayed there hovering for about 2 minutes, and then a 3rd white light came of thin air.   All three appeared to move slighty, as if conjoining, and then sped off in the direction it came.  That was a spaceship if I've ever seen one! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere.  PD));40.2166;-75.2565
