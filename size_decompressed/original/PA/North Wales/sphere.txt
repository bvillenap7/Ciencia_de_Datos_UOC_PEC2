Lustrous/metallic orb traveling between clouds on Route 202 (North) near North Wales, PA;2020-06-06 14:45:00;5-10 seconds;Lustrous/metallic orb traveling between clouds on Route 202 (North) near North Wales, PA Saw an illuminated orb-shaped object while traveling North on 202 (was a passenger in a car, driver did not witness). Object was traveling relatively slowly (similar speed to a bi-plane) towards the South in a consistent linear path. Orb-shaped object appeared to be metallic and was highly reflective. The object was not remotely shaped like a conventional commercial aircraft, nor did it have any sort of hazard lights. Witnessed object traveling for about 5-10 seconds, turned away, then upon turning back the object was nowhere in sight. Tried to monitor that section in sky for a few minutes after initially seeing the object but couldnâ€™t identify it a second time.;40.2166;-75.2565
