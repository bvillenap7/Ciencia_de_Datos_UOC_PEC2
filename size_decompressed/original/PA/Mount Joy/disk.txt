I was retiring for the night & looked out of the front door, as I do every night, I saw very bright lights in the sky.  The craft was flying at the same height as a plane.  The craft had many red lights on the top and many green lights on the bottom ( I could not see how many lights there were...so many!).  The lights pulsed & flashed, first the red ones then the green.  The red lights were very bright & radiated upward...they were as bright as many firetrucks!  The green lights were not as bright & radiated downward.  The red flashed then the green, never together.  The craft flew in a straight line and was silent.  I watched for about 2 minutes, until I lost it behind the houses & the tree line.  This craft was going from West to east, following the flight path to Harrisburg Int.  Airport.  The craft appeared to have a slight dome on top, although it was hard to see because the lights were so bright.  I didn't know what I ! was looking at as I have never seen anything like that before.  In the morning I told my husband what I saw.  He was a naval aviator, so I asked him what kind of military plane it was...he said no military plane would have that many lights.  This is something that I will never forget.  I am a retired administrative assistant.;40.1094;-76.5131
