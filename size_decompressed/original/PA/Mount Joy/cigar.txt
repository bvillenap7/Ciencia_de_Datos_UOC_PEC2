Bright stationary (15 Min.) cigar shaped object in southern sky in Mount Joy, PA (6:59pm-7:14PM) 1/15/2020;2020-01-15 18:59:00;15 minutes;Bright stationary (15 Min.) cigar shaped object in southern sky in Mount Joy, PA (6:59pm-7:14PM) 1/15/2020 I was adjusting a wreath on my front door & saw a very bright light in the southern sky over my neighbors house.  This light stayed stationary for awhile so I called my husband & got our binoculars & camera.  The object appeared to be cigar shaped and stayed in a stationary position from 6:59 PM to 7:14 PM.  The object was hovering at 25-30 degrees above the ground in the southern sky.  The object disappeared for about 5 minutes then reappeared to the right(S.W.) of where we first saw it and started moving to the east blinking red & white alternately. There was no sound at all. My husband was a naval helicopter aviator from 1971-1975. My husband said that commercial or military aircraft do not behave like this. I have 3 photos of this sighting. We are Coast to Coast listeners! This was my second sighting...this time I was prepared with my camera!;40.1094;-76.5131
