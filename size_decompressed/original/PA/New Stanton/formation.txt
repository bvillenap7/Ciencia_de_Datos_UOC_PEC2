Witnessed a group of orange/amber lights very low in the sky, south of PA turnpke in New Stanton, PA.;2014-08-09 22:23:00;00:00:30;Witnessed a group of orange/amber lights very low in the sky, south of PA turnpke in New Stanton PA My wife and I just entered the PA turnpike, heading west at the New Stanton interchange on the evening of August 9th, 2014.   We were probably only about 5 minutes on the turnpike while I (driving) noticed lights to my left (south of the turnpike).  I was driving around 70mph, so the duration of viewing the lights was probably less than 30 seconds.   The lights were low, very low and the surrounding trees obstructed my view and I could only see them in clearings of the trees.  But my initial reaction was to try to process what I was seeing for a few seconds until I said to my wife, What ((deleted)) am I looking at to my left?   She then noticed them too.  It was dark out of course, so the lights, which looked orange/amber in color and seemed to almost look rectangular.  I think there were about 7 of the lights, and they first appeared in a staggered formation, with some higher than the others.   However, the further we drove, they almost started to form a triangular pattern, with the tip of the triangle being at the highest light and the formation widening as the other lights were lower and underneath.   We could not tell if the lights were moving, but I think they may have been moving towards east, as we were traveling west.    I had seen on tv and the internet about the Phoenix Lights, and the lights I witnessed last night appeared very similar to that.  I actually asked my wife if they could be falling flares, as I could not explain to myself what I was looking at.   After about 30 seconds, we could no longer see the lights.;40.2164;-79.6044
