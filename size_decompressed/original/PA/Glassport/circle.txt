White lights circling around eachother in the clouds.;2014-10-17 22:30:00;15 minutes;White lights circling around eachother in the clouds. This isn’t the first time that I’ve seen something like this. I was standing outside on Friday night and I saw something out the corner of my eye.  So I looked and I saw a faint circle of light going clockwise.  Then I saw another light going counter clockwise.  It was going on for about ten minutes..   It looked like it was ether in the clouds or above them.  It was very cloudy that night.  Then, this airplane flew towards the lights then turned away from the lights then after a couple minutes the lights disappeared.  The whole thing lasted for about 15 minutes.;40.3267;-79.8968
