He says at around 0540 in the morning, his dog jumped up and was acting like it needed to go outside and relieve itself.  Once he let it out, it ran to the corner of the porch and froze.  He walked over to see what it was looking at and from several miles away he saw a light.  It got closer very quickly.  The video he sent me, shows a craft that is silent, and has three lights in the middle, with weird flickering lights or strobes to the side.  My uncle claims he never heard it make a sound.  He says the video caught it at around 400 feet in the air and that it had the mass of a 747.  He said that he has a better video, but he can't load it via cellphone and he has no internet access to upload it.  To say the least, this video is interesting.;39.9406;-77.9921
