There were 4 or 5 of us in the car.  It was a dark, clear night.  We noticed several cars parked on the side of the road, people looking at something in the western sky.  We stopped and I wondered what the big deal was about the light in the sky.  Looked like a plane or a copter to me.  They told me to keep watching.  The object was about 50 degrees above the horizon, moving in a southeastern direction.  As it got closer, I noticed that the light seemed to change to red and back to white.  It made a right angle turn and went higher in the sky.  No noise, no hesitation.  It made several 90 degree turns, in the meantime traveling southeast to northwest and back again.  The object could also completely reverse direction.  It traveled fast.  It went to the northwest and at that point we noticed there were 2 more objects -one from the southwest, one from the northwest that seemed to be descending on the object we were watching.  They all seemed to merge and after a couple seconds, the object sped off to the northwest at a 75 degree angle and disappear. Several cars had stopped and gone,  so I know there were quite a few that saw the event.  However, those that stayed to the end all agreed -Nobody saw a thing. I guess they are still keeping silent. I may be sketchy on the dates and time, but I know what I saw.  I will never forget it.  Incidentally, the driver of the car in which I was riding broke the speed limits going back home.  But he didn't see anything, either. Hopefully. someone else that was there beside that road that night can add to the story and firm up the dates. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
