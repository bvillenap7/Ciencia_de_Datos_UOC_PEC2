House sized cube on axis, colored lights pulsing, moving slowly about 25 feet off the ground;1975-06-01 22:00:00;1/2 hour;House sized cube on axis, colored lights pulsing, moving slowly about 25 feet off the ground Five people witnessed a cube on an axis, like a Rubric's cube tilted on a corner. It glowed squares of color, and changed color, pulsing bright to low lights.The colors were primary colors. It moved slowly along a valley , above the trees, near a creek-it seemed to follow the creek bed. It was almost as large as a house. I did not witness this- my friend did- but he is dismissive about it. I think he saw something unusual, he is not the type to go off into flights of fancy.He says his wife and sister saw it too, along with others. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
