Just above the clouds there was a circular light glowing in different colors for at least 15 minutes. The light would change color slowly, evenly transition from blue to purple, purple to red, etc. and it would randomly switch colors immediately, like instantly switch to pink or something. Several times it shut off all together and turned back on after a few moments.  It almost looks as though something was angular in the clouds, However it was so cloudy I could only make out likes a couple times. It also appeared to shift quite a few times, moving but not dramatically far or fast, just like pacing around in various directions.  I have 2 videos but donâ€™t know where to send them!;39.854;-75.7044000000001
