oval shaped flaming light;2003-07-12 21:15:00;5 seconds;oval shaped flaming light On Saturday , July 12,2003 at approximately 9:15 PM EST in southeastern Pennsylvania. I observed a elongated egg shaped object , glowing white in color . It looked like a shimmering sidways flame . The nose ( nose cone/ front ) of this object wavered like it was emitting heat . This object was seen in the southeastern night sky from my location and went from west to east direction . Its flight was very fast with a straight path and jerky movements . It made no sound what so ever . The object was above tree top level and above the power lines . At arms length it was larger than my fist . Actually , the object was almost in my back yard .Timing of sighting was less than five seconds and awe inspiring . Hoping someone else saw this .;39.854;-75.7044000000001
