Break in the clouds gave way to a triangle craft spinning in formation like levitating freely. That is what made us know it was them.  It made both me and my friends eyes start watering instantly.  I yelled up to it, We see you  And threw up a peace sign then it disappeared.   Also to add, my friend's car battery had just died and i was trying to jump his car when this happened we both looked up same time..  Not sure if any time was missing as we were stunned. ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to contact via telephone the source of the report, but was unable to reach him.  We question whether the report is since, but we can never know for certain.
