Cntr craft left,rest followed as observer stopped car below. I am curious what is done with this type of information, especially since it is after the fact of the incident. My mother, a stable, religious, and previously non-believing (in UFOs) person, related the following story to me this evening: At approximately 7 p.m she was driving home and saw a straight line of intense white V-shaped lights in a perfectly straight line ahead, about 1000' in the sky.  She described them as looking light football stadium lights only v-shaped, that close together and straight.  She ended up driving 10 blocks until she was nearly underneath.  She slowed down the car and rolled down the window to observe and try to figure out what they were, and at that point the center object left the formation proceeding straight forward, and the remaining object followed, still in tight, straight formation, and all were quickly out of sight. The one thing she thought very odd was that there was no sound at all from the objects, unlike aircraft. She is not the type to embellish or fabricate such a story, and did not even feel anything more than a curious amusement about this topic, but now is shocked, certain of what she saw, and a believer that what she saw was not any craft that she has ever heard of.  She related this to me to ask if I knew of any military aircraft that was quiet and matched that description because I served with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and knew of most military aircraft in the world. This is quite a story, and has really shaken her belief system.  I think it is fascinating and was interested to see if there is any way to check on air traffic activity during that period of time.
