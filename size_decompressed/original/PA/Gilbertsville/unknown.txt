Glowing object over Gilbertsville PA;2010-05-30 21:00:00;10 minutes;Glowing object over Gilbertsville PA Appeared to be a flame of some sort, but had a trailing light behind at times, thought it may have been a hot air balloon, but changed directions at same altitude, it moved at an altitude that we believe we should have heard noise.  But heard nothing, after watching longer realized it was not a flame, more like a glow.  I thought it was strange, did a little searching today on the web and found another person recorded pictures and posted on youtube, I did not record the images but many witnesses saw the same thing. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Genr8O9s3Fg;40.3033;-75.5977
