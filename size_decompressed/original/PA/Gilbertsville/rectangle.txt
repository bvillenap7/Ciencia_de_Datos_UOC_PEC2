On August 26th, 2016, at approximately 20:15, three black rectangular objects each with a single light were seen in the sky at dusk.  They were traveling in a straight line with 2 closer together and one lagging behind.  The altitude of the objects appeared to be between what an ultra light aircraft would fly and what a small aircraft would fly.  As the objects approached at a constant speed from the northwest, the lights went out.  The objects were still visible and at least one appeared to be rotating.  The objects passed by close without any sound or visible means of propulsion or lift.  The closest airport to their path is the Limerick PA airport. We (the observers) are husband and wife.  We are both engineers in their early 50s and neither has seen an unidentified object in the sky previously.  As engineers, we have been trying to come up with a logical explanation of the objects but have not been able to do so.  We considered such things as ultra light aircraft, weather balloons, drones, and gliders.  None of these seemed to fit what we observed.;40.3033;-75.5977
