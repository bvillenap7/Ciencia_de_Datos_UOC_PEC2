PD));2006-02-11 01:40:00;1 hour +;A bright light just above the tree line with scanning red lights There was a bright light just above the tree line out my window. It was at such an unusually low height that I watched it from my bed. The light stayed in one place and had a red light blink from side to side. Occasionally there would be a broad white light that would come down for a couple seconds. I noticed it there for about an hour and it was still there when I fell asleep. I have never noticed such a light out my bedroom window and was not there the night after this happened either. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a celestial body?  PD));40.5114;-75.0799

My daughter and I witnessed what at first seemed like an airplane that had been launched from behind the hill directly east of the Delaware River in the Erwinna Pa area, and headed eastward across the Delaware River from Erwinna Pa area.  The red light seemed too big to be an airplane, and it seemed to waiver a bit at times as it was heading toward the East side of the river.  It then traveled upwards and then seem to dissipate into thin air.  Within a few minutes another was launched? from the same spot and the same thing happened.   Following a few minutes later by another, and then three in a row.  Being the night of the Solstice, was it someone with some kind of light that could be launched and then burn at such a high altitude that someone launched?;40.5114;-75.0799
