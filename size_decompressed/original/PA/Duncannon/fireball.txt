The object appeared to rise in the eastern sky heading westerly.  We observed the object for approximately 1 minute before it completely disappeared.   I was unable to capture it with any recording devices.  I attempted to record it but failed.  The object appeared to be traveling in our direction prior to its complete disappearance.   We have no idea what we witnessed.  However, we are absolutely positive it was not an airplane, nor can we identify the object as anything we have ever witnessed.;40.4072;-77.045
