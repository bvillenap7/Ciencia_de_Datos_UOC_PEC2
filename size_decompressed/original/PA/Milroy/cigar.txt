Cigar-shaped gleaming object near the Milroy exit off of Route 322 East in Pennsylvania;2008-03-18 18:45:00;1-2 minutes;Cigar-shaped gleaming object near the Milroy exit off of Route 322 East in Pennsylvania. I was traveling east on Route 322 from State College, PA, and was near the Milroy exit when I noticed an oblong, cigar-shaped ojbect tracking across the sky from south to north.  It gleamed white, even though the sky was overcast and it was traveling BELOW the cloud deck.   There was no visible sunlight to reflect off of the craft. The light that appeared to be coming from it was constant, with no twinkling or flashing. As I watched it track across the sky, it moved slowly in a northerly direction and then disappeared.  Shortly after it disappeared, I saw a small prop plane coming from the other direction and heading toward the small local airport in Belleville. I did not report to the authorities, but checked online to see if any other people had reported seeing anything.  Nothing was posted in the local newspaper.;40.7226;-77.5556
