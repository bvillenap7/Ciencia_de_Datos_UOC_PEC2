Shinny bright silver ball floats over sky;2008-10-30 13:00:00;2 minutes;Shinny bright silver ball floats over sky Was driving south on Deercreek road around 1:00pm I happened to look up and saw this oval silver thing just hovering in place.  I tried to speed up to get a closer look because it seemed to be far a head of me off to my left towards Philipsburg. It didn't look to be that big ,but it was pretty high in the sky.  While I was getting closer the thing just shot straight up and disapeared in seconds . The sun made this thing shine pretty bright. I never told anyone in fear they would think I'm nuts.  I know it was not a plane. It was oval and nothing I know of we have that can fly.;40.9995;-78.2405
