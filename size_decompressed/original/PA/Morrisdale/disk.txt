2 silent silver disks one flying east one west pass closely by eachother and continue flying in exact opposite flight paths;2010-10-08 16:30:00;5 min;2 silent silver disks one flying east one west pass closely by eachother and continue flying in exact opposite flight paths On 10/08/2010 around 4:30 PM my mother and I had just returned home.  On the way to the door I noticed a shiny silver disk flying east and told my mom to look.  As we watched the object we noticed a second one travelling west directly toward it.  Both of us thought that they might collide but instead passed very closely by each other.  The objects were travelling in what seemed to be exact opposite flight paths. They also seemed to make no sound at all. While watching the objects we noticed a large white jet travelling south toward us and the objects. The objects seemed to be at a lower altitude than the jet.  Where the objects passed by each other seemed to be in front of the jet and at a much lower altitude.  We watched the objects until they were both out of view.  The entire event that we witnessed lasted about 5 minutes. They seemed to fly at about the same height that a helicopter would normally be at.  The objects were definitely close enough that we should have been able to hear the engine noise but there was none.;40.9995;-78.2405
