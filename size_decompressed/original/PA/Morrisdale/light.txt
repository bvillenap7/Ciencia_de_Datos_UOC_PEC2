It was 8 pm on a clear night in August, although I can't recall the exact date in August.  But I do remember it being very clear that night, because as I was standing outside the bingo hall with another person I had mentioned it to her and then looked to my right and saw 3 star like objects in a perfect triangle formation. What struck me odd about these lights was the fact that A)  They were in a perfect triangle formation and B)  They were a yellowish orange color and quite bigger than any normal star.   But as we started to talk I thought well, I guess it's just a strange looking star that I have never seen before, but then something very odd happened.  The star closest to us which would've been the one at the top point of the triangle shape broke apart from formation and began to move slowly towards us.  It continued to move like this, until it was right above us and out of site beyond the building.   I was stunned.  I don't know whether this w! as truly a UFO or not. But it was strange that it moved so slowly away from us after staying put for so long.   So, I don't know whether anyone can offer me any explanations or similar accounts, but I would be intrigued to find out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
