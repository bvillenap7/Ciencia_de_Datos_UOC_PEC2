I had such a perfect view with my binoculars.   I then called for my mother who she verified the same shape and colors.  Prior to informing my mom she was on her phone watching a you tube Visio when my mom mention her phone went wacky with interference she stated that it sounded ver muffled and people were talking very fast.  Mom thought this was strange, until she thinks the UFO might have had something to do with the interferance.   We watched this for about an hour until it slowly moved farther into the night and just disappeared into no where.;40.8273;-75.8824
