Reflective object changed flight directions by 90 degrees and disappeared.;2010-11-08 16:00:00;1 minute;Reflective object changed flight directions by 90 degrees and disappeared. I drive a truck route.  The route I drive is by a heavly traveled fly zone.  It is not uncommon to see up to 7 jet contrails at one time.   On November 8, 2010, at about 4:00pm I noticed a reflective object in the sky.  The sun reflected off of this object.  The object was traveling east at about the same speed a prop driven airplane would be moving.  I did not see the shape of this object, just the silvery reflection.  I was about ready to stop watching it.  The object changed directions by going 90 degrees north of it's original direction. The object did so very rapidly and then speed off from my sight. It's height in the sky was about that of a normal prop driven airplane.  I could not determine the size of it either. This object did not leave any contrails or noise.;40.5056;-78.0086
