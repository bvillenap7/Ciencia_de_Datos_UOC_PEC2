Five glowing orbs seen in Huntingdon, PA.;2014-06-07 22:00:00;10-15 minutes;Five glowing orbs seen in Huntingdon, PA. After a firework show at Raystown Lake, my friend and I started to look at the stars. We then saw the first orb which was flickering and orange in color.  The orb floated north and then flickered and disappeared.   We then saw four more additional orbs coming from different locations, floating and disappearing the same way.  We noticed a faint beam radiating from the bottom of the objects in the sky.   The glowing orbs were silent and they gradually floated across the sky before they gained speed and disappeared.;40.5056;-78.0086
