Saw a fireball in the sky over Huntingdon, PA.;2014-05-24 21:30:00;10 minutes;Saw a fireball in the sky over Huntingdon, PA On Saturday, May 24 at approximately 21:30 I walked outside to let my dogs in.  I looked up into the sky because something had caught my eye.  It looked like a bright red/orange fireball.  It was not moving. I called to my family to come out.  As my son and daughter came out it started to move slowly away from us, then it stopped again.   Then it began to move from left to right, not a lot, but it continued like this for two or three minutes, then it finally faded away. Total time we saw it: about 10 minutes.;40.5056;-78.0086
