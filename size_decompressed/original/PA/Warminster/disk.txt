Observed disk in NE sky.  Lights on bottom were pulsing.  They were red blue and white.  Spatial relationship to other objects seemed out of whack.  The disk appeared to be hovering just above  trees. The outline on bottom and top was very dim. I was in the military and worked with aircraft.  This object moved in a manner that no aircraft has moved that I ever saw.  It was completey silent.  As I observed it I was frightened and got a feeling that it was focusing only on me.  I was on front steps and was afraid to get up.  I finally go up, went inside house woke up wife and we stared at it outside of our window fro about 15 minutes.  It eventually moved up and back and high into the sky  but it just appeared at the new location.  Didnt see it moving there but it just reappreaed.  The one time i saw it in motion it went at a speed that was hunbdreds times faster than any jet I saw. It moved upward at an angle and disappearred.
