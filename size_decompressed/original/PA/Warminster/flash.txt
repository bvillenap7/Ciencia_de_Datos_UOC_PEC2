He quickly came in the house to show me and ask what I thought it was. I could easily see what he was looking at it appeared to be triangle in shape but the main thing was the changing of light colors from green, to red, to white, flashing back and forth, it lasted for almost a full 10 to 15 mins, dimming in brightness as time went on. We attempted to take pictures but unsuccessful, camera was missing card, then used I-pad camera, which showed a white halo  in sky as it was finished its changing of colored lights by this point.. We noticed several stars in the sky, but this object we saw was not a typical star.  It was obvious flashing, colors of lines that represented a triangle.  The object never appeared to move and if so extremely slow.  Just to the right of this object was a star.;40.207;-75.0744
