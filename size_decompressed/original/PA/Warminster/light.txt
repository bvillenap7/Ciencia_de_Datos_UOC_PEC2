First only one appeared in the sky (Sky condition thunder and lightning, electrical flashes)He stated the first one was a single whitish light which divided into three lights, twirled in a spiral pattern then returned to regroup into the single light. I asked him to time the occurrance and he said 20 seconds. About 10 minutes later he said another identical phenomenon appeared, so that two of them were in the sky simultaneously. I asked him to try to interpret them as the electronic billboard of a commericial blimp and he said that it did not seem to him that that was it.  I emailed another person who was in Warminster PA online at the same time and asked them to look into the sky but they said they saw nothing. My friend said that the occurrance faded into the electrically charged sky. Total time of occurrance about 20 minutes. I suggested that he email the Airforce to try to document the phenomenon with them. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether this event can be ascribed to an advertising light, but that is only a guess.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));40.207;-75.0744

I saw a bright neon-green light angle toward the ground low in the sky (about a 60 degree angle) at a fast rate of speed. I only had a short view as I saw it through a break in the trees.  The light was moving fast and it appeared to be too close to the ground not to hit the ground at the speed it was traveling. I saw nor heard any indication of this light hitting the ground.  The light appeared to be a round bright green dot with a brighter whitish center. The track it was taking was straight, no arc however my opportunity of viewing was short.  The sky was partly cloudy, temperature about 55F. No other apparent reason for light falling from the sky, no fireworks.  The color is was what caught my eye as I was looking directly southeast at the time.  I did contact a Philadelphia news channel to find out if this light was seen by anyone else. No reply from the e-mail as of 11:03pm.  There is no way of telling the distance this light was away from me so I can't even guess at the size. It appeared much larger (5 times or so) the size of aircraft lights or meteorite light.;40.207;-75.0744
Star like object acting erractically.;2015-05-23 22:00:00;30 seconds;Star like object acting erractically. While stargazing, my friend and I saw a light, which was the size and shape of a star, crossing the sky at a fast speed, obviously too high to be a plane and moving too fast to be a satellite.   The object traveled across the sky steadily before slowing down, making a radius type turn and continuing out of sight.   I've been watching the skies for 40+ years and never saw anything like this.;40.207;-75.0744

Light blue colored light gaining altitude in sky then disappeared;2019-12-06 05:30:00;10 seconds;Light blue colored light gaining altitude in sky then disappeared Add approximately 530 the morning of December 6, 2019 I was walking out to turn my truck on and I noticed a light blue colored light in the south western sky moving very fast at high altitude it appeared to be  gaining altitude  I knew it wasn't a plane because they were planes flying in the sky that appeared to be  thousands of feet below it The best I can describe it is it was the same color and size as an average star but appeared to be gaining altitude then disappeared there were no clouds in the sky that morning and it was still dark out;40.207;-75.0744
