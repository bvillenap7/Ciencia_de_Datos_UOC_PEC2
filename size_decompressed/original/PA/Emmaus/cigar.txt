Five bright orange/red lights, followed by a black object.;2014-07-13 21:45:00;3 minutes;Five bright orange/red lights, followed by a black object. While staring in to the night sky, I saw a total of 5 cigar shaped, bright reddish/orange in color, moving about 4 times as fast as a regular passenger aircraft.   I saw the first light, then 2 lights grouped together, then a third, and then the last one.   They were spaced within 40-45 seconds from each other.   I then saw a black object shortly after the last light, but there were no strobe lights or any lights on the black object.
