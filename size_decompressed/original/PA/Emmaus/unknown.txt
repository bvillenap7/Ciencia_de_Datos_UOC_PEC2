My Fiancé and I were taking a walk in town around 8:00pm. My Fiancé said to me look at the moon, it looks like a smiley face. While walking down the sidewalk the moon was right in front of us. Then all of a sudden I look up and under the moon there was this bright light and it was pulsating.  I said to her, that looks weird. The light would get brighter and then darker but not completely turning out. I looked at other lights in the sky to compare and they were blinking on and off, not up and down like a dimmer switch.  Also while looking at this it seem like it was changing color. It was moving slowly in a straight line across the sky in the south east. Then it came to a complete stop for a second or two and then started moving again. Then lost sight of it behind the trees.  It was weird to me because I never seen something like this in the sky pulsating, moving slowly, changing color and stopping and going. Don’t know but it was sure strange.
