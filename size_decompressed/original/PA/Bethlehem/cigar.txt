I was stuck in traffic on Schoenersville road, Bethlehem, while taking my son to school.   We were running late, so I kept checking the time.   At 7:55, my son shouted, Mama, a UFO!   I looked to my left and saw what appeared to be a small passenger plane coming in for a landing.  I asked Are you sure?  It looks like a plane.   He said No, it was turning in circles.   I looked again and was about to tell him that I thought it was a plane, when it halted in mid-air and moved in the opposite direction.   We were stopped at a red light on an overpass, and we both watched it as it moved from a northerly direction to a southerly.   I took a closer look at it and realized that my initial impression of the craft was wrong, there were no wings, windows or tail like a small plane.  It was bright silver and it gleamed in the sunlight.  It was a very clear day with a bright blue sky, and the craft was shaped like a cigar.  From my perspective, it moved over Route 22, and! it seemed to be very maneuverable.   My son was excited, and when traffic began to move again, he gave me updates as to what the craft was doing.  Unfortunately, there was no good place for me to pull over, and I had no camera on me, so I just continued driving him to school.    He yelled It's getting bigger, It's changing shape,  and It cloaked!  It cloaked! but I cannot confirm this, since I would have had to turn around in the drivers seat in order to observe it again.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999
