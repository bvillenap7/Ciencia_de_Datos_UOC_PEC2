UFO Close Enough To Throw Rock At It,  Makes No Noise In Bethlehem PA 1994;1994-06-01 22:00:00;6-8 min;UFO Close Enough To Throw Rock At It,  Makes No Noise In Bethlehem PA 1994 We were cruising around in our car at night, I was the passenger and my friend was driving.  This was just my friend and me in the car.  Anyway we were driving on top of South Mountain near Stabler Arena when I noticed what look like a helicopter above a new housing development.  They were still building this development.  This was about 7 football fields away or so.  I said to my friend as a joke look its a UFO!  We thought it was a Helicopter because it was just staying still and hovering.  I said to my friend to flash your lights at it in which he did.  This object began to move upon us flashing our lights coming directly towards us.  We then began to drive towards it as well.  It amazed both of us that it responded to our flashing.  There were no other cars in the area either.  Anyway we drove closer to it arriving at the main road and we stopped our car in the middle of the road.  This object was still coming right at us and moving very slow.  I got out of the car and my friend stayed in until curiosity finally got him out of the car as well.  I said to my friend what is that? We both at this time were filled of adrenalin as this object slowly passed right next to us. It was close enough to throw a rock and hit it.  We could both see it wasn't a Helicopter or a Airplane.  I can remember it was Triangle shaped with 3 lights.  One in the front and 2 in the back.  You could see metallic on it as it went by, we looked at the side of the ship and some under belly.  We were both stunned at what we were seeing, the thing that always got us was that there was no sound, maybe just a slight hum.  You couldn't hear an engine!  It slowly went passed us.  It disappeared when it went behind the other side of the mountain.  I'm still shocked at this.  We both got back into the car and drove off.  My mind still tries to figure out what really was that thing.....My friend and I talked about this recently bringing back a lot of memories etc and we wanted to report this to you.  We both pledge that this is 100% true, we were not drinking and in a normal solid state of mind.  2 In PA ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Dark equilateral triangle outlined by lights, no noise, east to west movement, very slow speed.;1998-12-15 21:00:00;4 minutes;Dark equilateral triangle outlined by lights, no noise, east to west movement, very slow speed. I was on my second-story deck looking east when I saw a light pattern that did not make sense. It looked like an equilateral triangle. The middle of the triangle had  no lights and was dark because the time was about 9 o'clock at night (or thereabouts). It was mid-December of 1998, approximately. There was no noise whatsoever as it passed over my home at an extremely low rate of speed while heading directly west. The Lehigh Valley International Airport is nearby so I am aware of the various shapes of aircraft lights at night and this object did not fit the light patterns that are  known to me. Also, airplanes make noise. This thing did not make any sound at all. I just told a few friends, some of whom said they had heard  similar stories from others.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999
Orange triangle.;2013-03-12 08:45:00;40 seconds;Orange triangle. Tonight, a Flaming triangle flew over my house making no sound,  It appeared to be a orange in color but the back end appeared to be flaming and the front looked pointed.  It's cloudy here and I could see it clearly so it was under the clouds.  It kept on a straight and level path.  I was startled but it kept moving away, so I called my daughter to come see it...  I listen to you on the Rense Network.  If you have any questions please use my email.  Thank You.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999
Triangular formation of cream-white lights seen in Bethlehem Pa 4th of July 2015.;2015-07-04 21:45:00;2 minutes;Triangular formation of cream-white lights seen in Bethlehem Pa 4th of July 2015 I was at a friends house near the corner of Broadway & Crestline in Bethlehem, Pa.  Her back yard has a great view of the Steel Stacks (old Bethlehem Steel plant turned into a public event center).  There was a fireworks display for the 4th of July which was just beginning. I noticed an odd light off to the north, our line of sight to the Steel Stacks being in an ENE direction.  As I watched, it moved in a slight arc and then a straight line where it slowed and hovered.  I pointed it out to my friend, who acknowledged seeing it, but was more interested in the fireworks display. As I studied the object, I was able to see a central brighter cream-white colored light surrounded by three smaller cream-white lights arranged in an equilateral triangular form about the central light.  Occasionally I was able to see a red line going from one of the outer lights to the central light.  There were no flashing red or green lights, and no noise, although between the professional and amateur fireworks it was hard to hear anything. After hovering for 30 seconds to a minute the object just faded away and disappeared.  It did not fly off or move from its hover position. There were aircraft in view, as the Lehigh Valley International Airport was in our view.  This object did NOT resemble any aircraft flying that night.  I did take a photo of the object, but it is indistinct. My friend and I are both in our late 50's, both professional people, and we both have spent a good deal of time outdoors both day and night.  I have an interest in aircraft and enjoy plane spotting.  I have seen several strange things in the sky in my time including a completely silent C-130 at very low altitude.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999
