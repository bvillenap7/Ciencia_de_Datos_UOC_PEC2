As we came around a corner that offered an unobstructed view of the SE sky we saw three bright (magnitude -1 or so) equally spaced (if I had to guess I would say they were about 100 to 200 object apparent diameters distant from each other) orange lights moving slowly north.   The objects were approximately the same diameter as an iridium flare would appear (we have seen and can easily identify iridium flares).  As we watched the objects sputtered and faded out.  We are 99% sure what we observed were flares.  They appeared very similar to the Arizona Lights that caused such a stir a few years ago and were subsequently identified as flares dropped from A-10â€™s during a military exercise.   It is possible that if they were indeed flares they may have been part of some sort of military exercise at the Willow Grove Naval Airbase which lies in the general direction of the observation..but military exercises on Thanksgiving night?   We are hoping someone else in the area spotted this as well and will submit a collaborating report.

Bright reddish orange lights in southern sky.;2015-06-09 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;Bright reddish orange lights in southern sky. Went out for my usual nightly stargazing.  This was something I have never seen in all my nights.  3 extremely bright lights were in the southern sky.   I ran inside to get my binoculars.  When I came back out one of the three lights was fading and moving south.   After about 5 minutes the other two began to do the same.  After a total of ten minutes they had faded/moved on completely.   They were a bright reddish orange in color.
