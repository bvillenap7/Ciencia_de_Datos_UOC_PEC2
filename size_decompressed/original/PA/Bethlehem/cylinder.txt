My second sighting of a chrome-colored craft during morning rush hour.;2010-03-09 07:57:00;2 minutes;My second sighting of a chrome-colored craft during morning rush hour. This was my second sighting of an unidentified craft in the same area.  The first sighting was September 2009.  This time the craft was cylindrical in shape, like a cigarette, with a black vertical stripe in the middle.  It was traveling slowly in the westerly direction, as I was traveling eastbound on Schoenersville Road in Bethlehem.  I noticed the shape coming towards me in the sky as I sat in my car at a red light.  As it came into view I realized that it was not a jet flying at a high altitude, but a substantially smaller craft.  It moved slowly above the building to my left, and my son made a comment about the shape of the craft.  It was a bright silver chrome, and it shone in the sun.  It was a sunny day with a blue sky and no low-lying clouds or fog.  The traffic light changed and I continued driving until it was out of sight.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999
