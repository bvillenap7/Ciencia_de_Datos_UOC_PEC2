large, bright white lights with one red light that hovered about 75 feet in air;2010-03-09 18:00:00;45 seconds;large, bright white lights with one red light that hovered about 75 feet in air I was driving on south side of Bethlehem on Hayes Street.  I stopped at a STOP sign when I saw what I first thought was a large aircraft but realized it was much too large to be an aircraft.  I originally thought it was going to crash into a house because it seemed to drop quickly out of the sky, but it stopped directly above/in front of me and hovered about 75 feet in the air.  It was very bright white lights with one area of red light.  I pulled my car over to get a better look and when I looked up again, the object was gone.
