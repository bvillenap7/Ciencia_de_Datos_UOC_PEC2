I saw a large bright orange cirular shape at approximately 7 o'clock position near the moon.   At first I thought it was a planet,since it was stationary for several seconds.  The object then began to move NNE towards the moon and appeared to dissappear behind the moon and emerge at 1 o'clock.  The object then continued to gain altitude, still moving NNE, and then it was no longer visible.  The object appeared white and very small when it emerged from behind the moon.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999

Bright silver object high in the sky moving slowly to the South East.;2021-08-15 17:00:00;5 Minutes;Bright silver object high in the sky moving slowly to the South East. UFO Report August 15th Approximately 5:00 pm.  Location â€“ Wind Creek Casino Bethlehem Pennsylvania.  I was in the parking lot of the Casino at approximately 40.615570 -75.360677 looking East.  There was a construction crane to my East.  When I first saw the object, it was framed in the vertical and horizontal portions of the crane.  The object appeared to be very high in the sky.  It was moving slowly to the South East.  It was very bright silver.  It appeared to be mostly round, but was so small that it was hard to tell.  Since there is a construction crane in the video that I made, it may add some perspective to the size, distance, and speed.  I took a 50 second video with my cell phone.  You have to expend the video to even see that something is there.  I watched the object of a couple of minutes before I entered the Casino.  Your director suggested that it may have been a Google Weather Balloon.  I would accept that as being a reasonable explanation for what I saw.  I would be willing to share a video that I took with my cell phone.  It is approximately 50 seconds long.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999
