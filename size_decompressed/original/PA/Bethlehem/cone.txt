I was able to see small greenish blue lights where the wing tips would be, but only for a short while.   It continued in a leisurely fashion staying at a low altitude, all the while heading south.  It resembled a cone in it's shape because of the smallish tail of glowing orange trailing. The whole timeframe took about 5 minutes before I was no longer able to see it.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999
