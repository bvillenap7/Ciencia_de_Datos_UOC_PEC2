5 fireball objects in a V-shape formation flying low and slowly as witnessed by my husband and me.;2013-06-21 21:00:00;5-8 minutes;5 fireball objects in a V-shape formation flying low and slowly as witnessed by my husband and me. At approximately 9 PM, as I was getting out of my car in the driveway, I noticed something in my peripheral vision.  I turned around and saw 5 objects in V-shape formation flying overhead and up the road where we live in a terraced development.  The five objects reminded me of fireballs because of their color yet they were fairly circular.   They flew between 100-150 feet overhead and moved slowly.  I called to my husband inside and told him to look out back as they flew over the house.  He saw them, too, and then they immediately sped off.   I am posting this now because I just found out about this reporting website and up until now was very discouraged because everyone we told didn’t believe us.   I also called the airport and radio and local news station to ask if anyone else had seen the UFO’s that night.  No one said they did.  We will never forget what we saw.  Would have taken photographs if I wasn't so stunned by what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999
