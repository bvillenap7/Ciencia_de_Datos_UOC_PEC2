One was traveling from NW to SE, and the other, SE to NW. They were traveling very fast,which took only 5 min. to go from Zenith to horizon area of the sky. They appeared to be approx. 2 inches apart when they crossed paths with each other. I followed them with binoculars till out of my view.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999

White cumulus shaped object travelling horizontally then sloped downward. No noise or contrail.;2020-01-13 13:00:00;5 seconds;White cumulus shaped object travelling horizontally then sloped downward. No noise or contrail. In mid-January, my brother and I were sitting on my second-floor apartment patio when we saw a white cumulus shaped object travel across the sky. It started out travelling horizontally then quickly sloped downward.  We lost site of it behind a neighboring apartment bldg.  It didn’t appear to be that far away, but who knows.  My brother estimates 2-3 football fields away.  There were no lights, nor was there a contrail.  Also, it was absolutely quiet.  Its speed increased as it travelled.  After we regained composure, we immediately started looking online for an explanation ie – weather balloon, drone, etc.  I’ve checked a few websites thinking someone else saw it, but found nothing.  We’ve been hesitant to report it on local websites for fear of being called crazy.  I did post it on one facebook page, but didn’t really get any kind a reaction.  Probably should just delete it from there.  We cannot find a rational explanation for it, and we can’t possibly be the only people that saw it. It travelled over I-78, an extremely busy road.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999
