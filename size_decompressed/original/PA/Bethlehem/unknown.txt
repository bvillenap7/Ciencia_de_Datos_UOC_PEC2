As we were walking South on Madison Ave. toward Dewberry, I could see a bright light behind the trees. As we continued walking, 2 low flying, silent craft were heading straight for us.  They were descending all the while I was watching them.  I could only discern the bright white lights, no shapes. We turned around and high-tailed it home.  I kept looking back (praying all the way home), they turned a bit west (we were headed northeast).  I could see them as I looked down the side streets on our way home. I checked for a while, looking out the front of our house - they never came this way.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999

I also witnessed giant orange ball like that has two smaller circle (sort of reminded me Jet that fire comes out end when they start to fly) above my house and bigger (so it seem) than others with colors. I watch them with my two different binoculars and I could see clearly what I SAW.  I watch them at least 30 min.;40.6375515625001;-75.3833296874999
