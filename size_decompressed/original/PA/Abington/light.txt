Two orange objects spread apart.  They were long and thin shaped orange in color.  They stayed in one spot and then tilted sideways as they started to get smaller.  They descended extremely slow only a few feet as they were getting smaller and a plane came by the path and passed by and then did a complete circle in the sky and headed toward the objects.    They slowly were disappearing getting smaller until they could not be seen.  I left and still saw the plane flying over the area.
