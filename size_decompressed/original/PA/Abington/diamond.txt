I was driving on a somewhat busy street, and noticed it on my left side thru the trees.  It was diamond shaped from what I could tell...the outline of the craft was faded and fuzzy, it sort of blended with the night sky in the backround.  It had white 5 lights, 1 on each corner and one in the middle.   I rolled down my window and didn't hear any plane.  I was going about 45 mph, and had to speed up a bit to keep it to keep it in sight on my side.  I estimate it was going about 60 mph....very slow for something as big as an average jet.   I have lived next to a Naval Airbase my whole life, so I know all the aircraft flying around here pretty well.  This looked like NOTHING I've seen before.
