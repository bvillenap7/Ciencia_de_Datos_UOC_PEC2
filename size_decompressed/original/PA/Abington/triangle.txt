Triangular shaped object glided through the sky in Abington, Pa..;2012-12-13 00:00:00;60-90 seconds;Triangular shaped object glided through the sky in Abington, Pa I was watching the meteor shower, looking for meteors in the sky, I was standing next to my house where i could get the best view of the sky.  I turned to look at the other side of my house up in the sky and above my house i witnessed a soaring object.   This object glided through the sky, it was triangular shaped with 3 dim lights at each point.  The whole triangular shaped object moved, it was definetly not a meteor or shooting star, it did not disappear.   I followed it with my eyes as far as i could until it go so far away it was out of eyesight. It was not an airplane, nor a helicopter...the lights on it did not blink like an airplane would.  They were 3 large round dim lights in the shape of the triangle.;40.1281;-75.1074
