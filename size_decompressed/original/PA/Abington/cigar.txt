Two clouds in the sky.  Blue sky. Crystal clear. The one small cloud, NE sky, had what looked like a bright star. As the cloud moved....So did this thing... lol VERY BRIGHT.. Skymaster Binoculars were brought out. So. The object was cigar/cylinder shaped, but it was changing colors. Reflecting off the sun, or lights, I'm not sure, but colors changed, none the less.  At one point, it did seem to have a cross appearance, but who knows.  My wife observed as well. With both naked eye...and the binoculars.... As the cloud moved west, so did this thing...clouds moved out of site. As did it! Grrrrrrrrr Definitely not a weather balloon or drone. 100 percent positive. Almost as it moved within that cloud on purpose... like a cover....being covert.... Again.... Sky is a blue as the ocean.  Literally 1 percent cloud cover... Hate not knowing......;40.1281;-75.1074
