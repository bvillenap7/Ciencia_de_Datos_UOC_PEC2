Something small, circular and white very slowly moved from the north down the sky toward the flight paths to Philadelphia Airport.  It was much too slow to be an airplane, and I almost thought it was a lost balloon.  At one point a plain flew past in front of the object's path, but I was unable to tell if they were at the same altitude. I went inside to get get binoculars and when I resighted it, there was a second object (with a red semicircle of light moving in a circular pattern along its bottom) moving along with the first. They continued to slowly head toward the horizon together until the sun obscured them from view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
