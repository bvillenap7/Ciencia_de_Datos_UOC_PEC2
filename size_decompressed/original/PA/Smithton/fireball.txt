Unusual pulsating ball of light.;2011-07-04 22:07:00;20 seconds;Unusual pulsating ball of light. After watching fireworks for the evening, I was headed home along Interstate 70 Eastbound.  Just before reaching the Smithton Truckstop, I saw what I first thought was a plane on fire, in the sky, left of the Interstate, headed West.  The object in question did not seem to have any blinking or standard aircraft lights, but had a pulsating fire looking light, which did not turn completely off at any point.  The object seemed to be traveling at a consistent speed, like a normal aircraft, but the light is what made it unusual.  I was unable to safely pull over and observe it, as construction work is in progress along that section.;40.156;-79.7427
