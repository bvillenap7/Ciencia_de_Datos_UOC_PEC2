This morning, January 21, 2014, around 7:15 am, in Morrisville, PA, my brother came upstairs to my room shocked and confused about something he just saw.  He's not used to computers, so he asked me to post this.  He described seeing orange shooting lights in the sky.  At first, he thought perhaps there was a fire, but after a while, he realized it was not coming from a fire. He cannot explain what the source of it was.  I did a search on the internet asking what it could have been, and this website was the first website that came up.;40.2104;-74.8278
