The object flew across the sky at a speed that I have not seen before.  It turned and made zig Zag movements. It dissapeared into the clouds.;40.2104;-74.8278
Circular disk shaped with lights;2013-07-27 22:00:00;5 minutes;Circular disk shaped with lights While sitting last around 10 pm with my husband on our patio with just our chimney lite we both saw a circular object in the eastern sky.  It first appeared with the lights bright we first thought it was fireworks but its speed slowed down to nothing seem to be stationary and just faded out of sight.  Very weird!;40.2104;-74.8278
