Green lights in oval shape seen over Morrisville PA;2009-02-18 18:00:00;1 min;Green lights in oval shape seen over Morrisville PA I was driving south on Pennsylvania Ave and my son saw green lights in an oval pattern in the sky.  After going under the rail road tracks I looked up in the direction he had pointed to.  I also saw an oval shaped figure in a distance just hovering in the sky with a series of green lights.  When my husband got home about 7:15 pm he saw an un-explained white flash of light similar to lightening that lit up the kitchen windows.  He ran outside and nothing was out side, and nothing had driven down the street that would have made the flash.;40.2104;-74.8278
