Three sons and friends saw multiple flying objects just before Dusk in Waynesboro, PA;2008-10-15 18:43:00;5 minutes;Three sons and friends saw multiple flying objects just before Dusk in Waynesboro, PA While there was a difference in the number of UFOs spotted, my sons and one of the friends, ages 4, 6, and two 8 year olds, saw several flying objects in the south west to south east skie of South Central PA. One of my sons claims to have seen three small ships and one larger ship, while my other son (6) claims to have seen one large and one small one. All four kids came running home out of fear because they hadn't see anything like this before. The smaller ships were described as more pod like by my oldest son and his friend. The larger ship was described as a battle ship and was much larger than the other ships by all accounts. The objects were described as 50 oak trees high by my son -- so from his account I'm estimating these were close to 500-1000 feet from the ground.  The smaller ships has three lights and the larger one had six lights. The lights were described as triangular on ships. The small ships were were headed towards the larger ship, but had circled around the area looking for people according to my sons. The larger ship was described like a spear by my oldest son, while the other, smaller ships were more tear dropped shape.;39.761;-77.5672
