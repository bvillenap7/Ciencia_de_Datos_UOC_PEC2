Crudely cloaked bomerang object flying do West across Pennsylvania night sky;2006-04-23 21:15:00;12 seconds;Crudely cloaked bomerang object flying do West across Pennsylvania night sky I regularly walk my dog between 9 and 9:30PM.  Over the years I've seen dozen's of satellites and falling stars, etc..  About 3 months ago, I decided to start looking for black or non-bright objects in the night sky.  Well, last Sunday night at the stated time I saw a bomerang shaped object moving do West.  The object looked like it was crudely cloaked (could only make it out because it distorted the stars behind it).  The object made no discernible noise.  It gave off almost no light (maybe just a little gray light).  At first I thought it was a Carnival or search light, but this object KEPT a constant course across the sky (I watched it cross the sky to the western horizon).  Assuming this object was at typical jet altitude, I would say it was 3 to 4 times larger than a jetliner and traveling around 3500MPH (it traversed the sky in approx. 12 seconds, etc..).  If I was looking for bright objects in the night sky (as I've done until recently), I probably would have missed this event.  I wonder if this object was extraterrestial, or an experimental government stealth aircraft. Did anyone else see this object?;39.761;-77.5672
