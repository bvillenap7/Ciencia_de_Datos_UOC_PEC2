Late at night on March 20th, 2018 at approximately 3 am, my dog woke me up to go out into the backyard.  I got up and let him outside and proceeded onto my deck in the rear of my yard.  While I was waiting for the dog I noticed a large circular whitish or silver object off to my left moving from north to southeast.  The object was moving very slowly just above the tree tops and making no sound.  The object was approximately 100 to 200 hundred feet from me.  The object did not emit or have any lights as a normal aircraft.  I was astonished at what I was witnessing and as I watched the object proceed in front of me as I was facing southeast the object turned upward 180 degrees where it seemed to stand on end for a moment.  It was then that I saw the object appear to have a different shape such as the shape of a boomerang.  Then suddenly and without a sound the object disappeared directly upward and was out of view within seconds. After the object disappeared, I heard an odd growing noise near where the object disappeared and my dog began growing.  I hurried my dog back into the house and my dog would not leave rear sliding door. I only told three people of this and have been trying to figure out what it was.;40.095;-74.9033
