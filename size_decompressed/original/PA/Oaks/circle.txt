Three orange orbs traveling across night sky;2012-07-07 22:00:00;4 minutes;Three orange orbs traveling across night sky Stopped to watch fireworks that were popping off in the distance when about 9 red orbs were flying in the sky traveling in threes.  At one point two orbs looked as if they were going to collide and then suddenly disappeared.  Three more surfaced and traveled across the sky rather quickly.  They made no noise but had a strange flight pattern and did not appear to have the same lighting as standard aircraft.;40.1308;-75.4627
