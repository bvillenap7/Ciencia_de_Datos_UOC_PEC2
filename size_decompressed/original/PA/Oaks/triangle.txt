UFO Sighting on Route 422 near Oaks;2011-08-05 21:55:00;minutes;UFO Sighting on Route 422 near Oaks While heading east on 442 (at 8:55pm) between Tropper and the Oaks exit there was a UFO sighting. This occurred near the Christian Academy but on the Valley Forge side of the road.  The object appeared 20 feet from the left side of the road and about 6 stories high. From a distance it appeared to be a large radio tower however there was no flashing red light and the object did not move.  When I drove closer it was evident that the object had 3 white lights (two in the middle on each side and one front and center) that were not overly bright.  The lights did not shine on the ground they just appeared to illuminate the immediate area. The UFO was made out of steal (with no apparent windows) and was shaped almost as a fighter jet.  The UFO had no outside markings and did not move.;40.1308;-75.4627
