Saw bright star which we believe from the star mappings to be mars,  this thing sat more in the Eastern sky, seemed to be some distant out, yet like it was a plane that should be coming toward us with what looked like multicolored lights flashing around it, But it never moved any great distance, Seemed to just hover a bit left a bit up a bit right,   Planes could be seen flying in that immediate area but nothing seemed to be aywhere near it,  It seemed to be fading the longer we were out there but never truly left the sk while we were there,;40.7762;-76.346
