Assumed it was a plane from Philly but it didnâ€™t really change position in over half an hour. Seemed to change from a cylindrical shape to a spherical shape to a saucer shape and back. Very tiny and difficult to determine what it was, even with binoculars.  Disappeared with sunrise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
