Orange glowing craft fly over Palmyra, PA.;2017-06-11 21:25:00;1 minute;orange glowing craft fly over Palmyra PA ..Noticed from the west a fast moving orange glowing object, as it gained altitude I saw through binoculars a lighted object drop from it, only visable for a second, as the main object with the orange halo around it became smaller as it moved higher and more rapidly to the east.   Then looking back to the west, we saw another one coming the same direction.  This one did not have the same glowing halo around it but again through binoculars I saw an orange light underneath a solid dark craft with no wings and appeared to be domed, circular and rotating.   This one  was at a lower altitude and turned to the north as I lost view of it behind some trees.  They were close enough to be heard but there was no sound.  All took place in about one minute.;40.2995;-76.5868
