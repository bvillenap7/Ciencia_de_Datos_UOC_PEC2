Yellow/white lights hovering over field in Palmyr, PA.;2015-08-05 21:16:00;1 minute;Yellow/white lights hovering over field in Palmyra, PA. I was driving up Forge Rd. here in town on my way home.  I went to turn left down my street and about 10 extremely big white/yellowish lights were hovering in the sky over a field.  I saw about 10 lights in a half oval and the lights were diminishing one by one and then, all of a sudden, the last 4 or 5 light went out at once.   I was under it off to the right and there was NOTHING in they sky no planes no flood light nothing.   I called the Palmyra police and they laughed at me and I was the first to call they said.   I went home went on facebook and my close friend saw it as well but he had 2 other people that could testify that we all saw the same thing.  He posted something to Facebook a little video of the very end.  I'm really freaking out.   I have seen other pictures of sightings in Arizona and Florida and its the SAME thing I saw.  I I'm very freaked out by what I saw and to know others saw what I did has me freaking out even more and this is why I am contacting you! !!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report confirms that the time of sighting was 9:16 p.m., not a.m..  PD));40.2995;-76.5868
