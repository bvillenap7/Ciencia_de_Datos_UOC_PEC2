Starlike object witnessed in morning sky;2012-08-31 06:16:00;6 minutes;Starlike object witnessed in morning sky I came out of Wal-Mart in Palmyra at 6:16 AM and looked up in the northwestern part of the sky at an angle of approx. 80 degrees and saw a bright light in the sky.  At first I thought it could be a star or planet, but no other stars were seen.  Being that the sky was already light due to the sun rising, the light from it was constant for the first 4 minutes that I observed it.  My thoughts that it was a star or planet changed when it gave off a burst of bright white light and increased in size for a moment.  It then started to gradually fade out until it was gone.  It never moved from its location in the sky and I heard no noise from the object.  I wish I had a camera with me to capture this object, but I donâ€™t even own a cell phone so I was left just observing it by eye.;40.2995;-76.5868
A light that at first was blinking on and off then stayed on and was flying around outside my window.;2014-07-01 03:30:00;~5 minutes;A light that at first was blinking on and off then stayed on and was flying around outside my window. 	The single UFO was at first in a straight line from left to right blinking and flying across my window.   Thinking it was a plane and it was 3:30 AM, I decided I would just close my eyes and go to bed.  Of course I had to keep watching it until it flew away, though.   Right after the object disappeared, it came from right to left as it's single light stayed on.  It flew around in circles for a bit then left the scene.;40.2995;-76.5868
