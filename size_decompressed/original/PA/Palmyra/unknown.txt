Machine-like humming heard.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-19 02:00:00;10 minutes;Machine-like humming heard Woke up to a loud humming and machine-like rumbling.  But didn’t sound like anything I’ve heard before.  It was loud right outside my window, and right when I woke up, it sounded like it flew away.  And I could hear the hum of the ufo after it left.  Very deep pitch.  As it flew away, the pitch of the hum went up and lasted for a few minutes.  And then later in the night, the sound came back for a couple minutes, and was gone again.
