Silver light, flying in a straight line, going north(?) disappeared after tracking it for about 2 min.  Many other objects were visible in sky - several constellations, and several planes at varying altitudes.  This object seemed to be beyond the atmosphere.  I admit that this very well could have been a satellite or other orbiting object.  But that's what a UFO stands for right?  Unidentified.  I am what I like to consider a level-headed software developer.  That's an oxymoron, I know.;40.3553;-80.1449
