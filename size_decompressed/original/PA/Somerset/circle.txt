Craft with lots of light, hovering over pine trees in the woods.;2009-07-15 10:00:00;15 minutes;Craft with lots of light, hovering over pine trees in the woods. I know this was about 4 or 5 years ago, but me and my sister were outside on the lawn at night, i would say around 10 or 11 pm, just hanging out looking at the stars, when we both saw a craft with light all around the bottom of it, going down but not the whole way to the ground, and it was flying real slow and hovering over some really tall pine trees, and it was pretty much just chilling there then it just seriously disappeared out of thin air, i swear on my life. It was about i'd say, the size of a beetle car.   later, when me and my friend investigated in the woods, we found 3 huge branches from nearby trees were somehow cut and fell exactly into the shape of a triangle.  It freaked us all out.  The craft was moving from south to north when it vanished.  All the light was just straight white, no colors.  God Bless.
