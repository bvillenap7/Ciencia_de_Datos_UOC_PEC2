Hovering above Interestate 76. Was like looking up into a burning cauldron of fire As I was driving West on Highway 76, approximately 2200 Eastern Time, NewYears Eve, I had noticed an Oval Reddish/Orange fire, hangin stationary in the sky. I kept looking as i neared it and passed underneath it.  Unfortunately there were no other vehicles in this area at this particular time of the night.  It was the oddest thing i had ever seen, and as i passed underneath it.  It was as if i was looking up into a Cauldron of Fire.  It was like fire. Reddish /ORange. As i passed this area, I kept looking around me, to see if the object was moving or possibly following, but i did not/could not see anything past this point.  It was extremely cold,  I was in the middle of nowhere on a holiday eve and i've tried to report this several times, And everytime i go to finish my report, the computer goes blank.  Am hoping it gets through at this time.  The strangest thing I've ever seen in my life.;40.0230134328359;-79.0773014925374
