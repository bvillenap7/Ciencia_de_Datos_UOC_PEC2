Rectangular lighted object spotted hovering in Pennsylvania.;2007-02-21 22:45:00;3 minutes;Rectangular lighted object spotted hovering in Pennsylvania. I was driving home from a friends home, and i saw bright blue lights in the sky.  I pulled over because i knew it was not an airplane.  I looked up at it and it was going fairly fast, sideways.   It had a rectangular shape with about 4 or 5 rows of small rectangular lights. The lights were blinking vey fast.   The road I was on was coming down from a ski resort and there were not many homes around, just a few farms , and lots of fields.  When I stopped to look at this object, it was hovered about a mile from the ground, and then it took off sideways again.  I could not tell where it went because it went so fast. I have had dreams about ufos but this was the first time I ever saw any.  I am sure of what i saw, my heart has never raced like that before.;40.0230134328359;-79.0773014925374
