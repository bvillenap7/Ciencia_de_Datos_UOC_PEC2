4 fireballs in formation beam across Somerset, PA sky before vanishing into the night.;2013-10-03 20:00:00;3-5 minutes;4 fireballs in formation beam across Somerset, PA sky before vanishing into the night Observers: two twenty year old college students. Note: Three months prior, in July, a group of four including my self(two 20 year old males, two 18 year old females-whom to my knowledge had not believed in the existence of UFOs and the like.) Witnessed a single orange fireball UFO phenomenon which played out strikingly slimier to other accounts of singular fireball UFOs. 10/03/13 Driving on route 601 just outside of Somerset,PA at exactly 8:00pm my passenger exclaims something and tells me to hang up the phone immediately, before I can finish asking him what this was all about, I look into the sky and notice four bright fireballs floating in a formation that I would describe as 7 shaped(the fireball that was leading them appeared far brighter than the other three).  I immediately pulled the car over to the side of the road, hung up the phone and handed it to my witness, we both jumped out of the vehicle, and then he began to record the event on the cell phone as we both watched in amazement. The four fireballs sat stationary for a few seconds and began to move in PERFECT unison, gradually gaining speed until the vertical three fireballs had disappeared.   The brightest leading fireball remained and flew through the sky at a high rate of speed and came into the close vicinity of an airplane before vanishing shortly after.;40.0230134328359;-79.0773014925374
