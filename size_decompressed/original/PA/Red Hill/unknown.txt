3 Red/Orange Lights Traveling in a line then disappearing over Red Hill, Pa;2011-10-28 21:45:00;4 minutes;3 Red/Orange Lights Traveling in a line then disappearing over Red Hill, Pa On October 28, 2011 at approx. 9:45pm  A friend and I were talking on the street near his car.  I looked up to the southern horizon and observed 3 red/orange lights moving in a northern direction.  All three appeared to be at the same altitude and appeared to be moving together in a line one behind the other.  The first light was considerably further in front of the other 2. They appeared to shimmer (for lack of a better word) they did not pulse or flash.  They appeared to be both red and orange.  They moved slowly like you would expect to see a high flying plane however they did not appear to be planes.  The movement was unusual and not consistent with smooth flight of a plane.  They also did not appear to be at an extremely high altitude.  Both my friend and I were having difficulty understanding what we were seeing. The first light made it to a point in the sky east of our position and at that point disappeared from sight.  A very quick fade would best describe it’s disappearance.  The other 2 lights appeared to change position slightly pulling together closer with the 3rd light appearing to move slightly under the 2nd light.   They both continued to travel north and faded quickly from sight at exactly the same location as the first lights disappearance.  While there was light cloud cover, the clouds did not appear to occlude the lights. The lights were considerably disconcerting, and we both remarked that we had just witnessed something unusual.  We both questioned aloud whether they could be flares but discounted it because of the apparent flight path of the lights.  We questioned as well whether they might be rockets but discounted that as well.   Total time observed 4 minutes. Conditions: 40’F Light cloud, no breeze.  Lights did not appear to make any sound;40.3758;-75.4846
