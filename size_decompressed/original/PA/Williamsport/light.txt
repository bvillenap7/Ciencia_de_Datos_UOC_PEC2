a star-like light traveling in a zig-zag pattern at the speed of light.;1982-07-15 01:30:00;approx 12 sex;a star-like light traveling in a zig-zag pattern at the speed of light. the date I am not sure of but is was the night that a lunar eclipse occured during the summer of '82 and occured in the early morining hours of eclipse. looking west-slightly west-northward, i noticed what seemed like a falling star at first, then continuing to look, I had seen what looked like a star moving southernly, very, very fast, like in an instant. it seemed like it was among the stars, like one of the stars with medium to bright in intensity and looked just like a star, white in color. It has stopped, then continued to move in a zig-zag pattern traveling from south to west. when i first noticed it would go from point to point with a complete stop between points, then traveled in same pattern/direction non-stop until out of sight. the sky was clear with stars.  the speed of this object was incredible!....I had a thought that it was masquerading as a star so it would not be noticed.  I was wide awake taking photos of the moon. I would have taken a photo if it wasn't over so soon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

4 reddish orange feiry objects spotted moving over Williamsport, PA, then disappeared.;2015-08-22 21:00:00;2 minutes;4 reddish orange firey objects spotted moving over Williamsport, PA, then disappeared. My wife and I witnessed 4 lighted objects in the sky at approximately 9pm tonight over Williamsport PA.  The objects were west of our vantage point moving slowly across the the sky from a North to South direction.   At first we thought they were a formation of 4 helicopters, but there was no noise and no strobe lights. -just a dimly flickering firey orangish redish color.  The 4 objects were moving in unison with 2 together slightly ahead of the other 2, which were together.   From our vantage point the 4 objects formed what looked like a rectangle if you were to connect the dots.   They then slowly (about 10 seconds) became dimmer and disappeared. I'm an engineer and commercially licensed pilot, my wife is a Lawyer. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
