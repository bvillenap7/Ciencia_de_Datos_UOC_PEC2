The sky lit up for about a minute and all of a sudden two huge looking balls of fire flew over the mountains with long neon bright blue tails.   They went rather slowly and were seen for about 5 minutes.   Thats the first time I have ever seen anything like that before in my life.  My imagination is pretty normal and i am not one to make things up. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.2396942148759;-77.0062132231405
