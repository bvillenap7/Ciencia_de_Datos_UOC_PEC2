Bright orange fireball;2007-06-05 21:30:00;about 3 minutes;Bright orange fireball We were sitting on the patio about 9:30 pm and facing the south , toward the mountains, when all of a sudden there was an orange fireball which seemed to have dropped out of nowhere. It dropped so far and then proceeded to the east at a very slow speed. we were  maybe about 1/2 mile away from it and it looked very low, there is no way of knowing how low it was as we watched it until it disappeared behind some trees. To my best estimation, it might have been several hundred feet up. It was bright orange, and there was no noise. when I held my thumb out against it... some of the orange showed around my thumb. so I am not sure how big it really was.;41.2396942148759;-77.0062132231405
Fireball in the sky over the Susquehanna River in Williamsport, PA.;2007-06-24 21:50:00;Aproximately 2 mins;Fireball in the sky over the Susquehanna River in Williamsport, PA. My partner and I were out on the Susquehanna River in our cabin cruiser. Shortly after sunset we were motoring slowing up the river, which is actually westbound watching the campers along the river close up their sites for the weekend since it was a Sunday night. Naturally as soon as the sun had gone down the air temperature became a little cooler and my partner went below to stay warm while I continued to slowly “chug” up the river enjoying the calm, cool weather. Approximately around 9:45-9:50 I was looking directly ahead of the boat. Just above the small hill there was a bright orange/reddish light. Since it was near the top of the hill, I didn’t give it much thought thinking it wasn’t anything special. I had just thought it was someone hosting a bonfire party to end the weekend. So I glanced away for a few seconds to see the camp sites along the river and when I returned looking forward the light had definitely increased in altitude. This caused me to wonder what it was since it was an odd color. It was EXACTLY the same color as a camp fire, a very big and brilliant camp fire in the sky. It surpassed in size and brilliance any other lights in the sky including airplanes, stars, planets, etc. At this point I thought “How strange? Normally an airplane would not be an orange color!” I pulled back the throttle of the boat into neutral and examined this strange light. It raised directly above the western horizon in altitude and followed an arch like course directly over top of us. As it approached it gained more and more altitude. Which was strange because I thought if it was a plane, like I have seen many times before, the altitude would not increase so drastically. I could tell the altitude was increasing because as it came closer to us overhead, it became dimmer and dimmer.  I couldn’t make out any type of shape except it looked like a camp fire in the sky. Orange/Reddish color with no exact shape. I was concentrating to see if there were any red or green airplane lights on it or if it emitted any sound, which it didn’t. At one point it was directly over head, still traveling in a west to east course.  I was so intrigued by it that I quickly ran downstairs to grab my binoculars, but by the time I got back up on deck it had disappeared completely.  Now I have seen satellites and even the space shuttle shortly after sunset with a naked eye, but every time I have seen these they were going east to west because the setting sun below the horizon is reflecting off of the higher altitude craft. But in this situation it was moving west to east and surely I could not see any reflection from the sun off of the dark side of the craft. So I know it was emitting it’s own light source and was not a reflection. Also it was not a meteorite since it was gaining in altitude and it had a constant speed across the sky which was somewhat fast for a plane, but slow for a meteorite.  I believe in UFO’s and many of my family members have seen them around central Pennsylvania over the years. My brother, mother, aunt, and others all have seen them, so I grew up with the belief that they do exist, but not until that night did I actually see something that I can’t explain.;41.2396942148759;-77.0062132231405
Orangish yellow orb seen by a friend and I.;2012-08-23 21:45:00;3 minutes;Orangish yellow orb seen by a friend and I I live on the second floor of a multi family home, and after long days I like to sit out on our balcony, just to relax.  On this particular Thursday night, I noticed this small orangish yellow orb appear out of no where, which quickly caught my interest.  At first I thought this ‘thing’ was a plane, until I noticed a commercial aircraft at a higher altitude and quickly realized that this orb didn’t have any of the normal red and blue/white flashing lights.  So again, I studied this orb thinking that it may have been a helicopter with their spot light on, but for how low this orb was, it made not a sound.  My neighbor came out, when I pointed out to her, just to make sure that I wasn’t seeing things, or that at the angle I was at, I may have missed something.  Sure enough, she seen it as well, and confirmed that it was neither an airplane nor a helicopter.  As she continued to talk to me, I did not once take my eyes off this ‘thing’.  It was moving South to North, not extremely fast, but at a good speed.  The next thing I know, it just disappears.  I thought it may have just been blocked from my view, due to other houses and trees around me, but even after walking to a spot where there was nothing to block my view, I couldn’t find it anywhere.  Even my neighbor could not spot it.  I stayed out later hoping that it might come back, or that another one would come, in hopes to catch it in a picture or video, but the rest of the night went on uneventful.;41.2396942148759;-77.0062132231405
