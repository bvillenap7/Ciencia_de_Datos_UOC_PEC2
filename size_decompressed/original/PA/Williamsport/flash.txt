Saw 4-5 bright flashes or balls of Fire.  Few others saw but some as far South as Harrisburg. Then 6-7 minutes later a couple of explosions but they were 6-8 minutes later and didn't seem connected.  The light flashes were almost parallel and spread across the sky.  Wasn't typical heat lightning nor a lightning strike.  I have never before seen ANYTHING before quite like it.;41.2396942148759;-77.0062132231405
