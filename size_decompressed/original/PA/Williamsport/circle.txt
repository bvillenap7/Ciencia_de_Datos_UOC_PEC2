Two round white objects over Williamsport, PA.;2015-10-21 10:33:00;20 seconds;Two round white objects over Williamsport, PA I observed two objects travelling west to east.  Both had an apparent size about equal to an airliner at 30,000 feet, but wings were not visible, and the apparent speed was roughly 10x faster than a typical airliner.  No vapor trails whatsoever.  Both objects were travelling in the same direction, but along slightly separate parallel alignments.  One led the other by about 5 seconds.  Both objects were observed nearly directly overhead, slightly to the north of my location.  With the sun low in the southeast, it seemed unlikely that I was seeing a reflection of sunlight off the objects.  Both objects were bright white against a slightly hazy blue sky.  One object appeared round, and the other object appeared slightly oval shape and was rotating at about 2 revolutions per second.  Weather conditions: clear with calm winds, about 45 F.;41.2396942148759;-77.0062132231405
18 dots - 50k+ ft - Williamsport, PA.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-23 06:15:00;15;18 dots - 50k+ ft - Williamsport, PA Observed a series/string of 18 circular dots traveling SW to NE above Williamsport, Montoursville PA approximately 6:15am.  Objects did not have normal flight strobe indicators, yet did have lighting.  No sound of aircraft engine were heard during the period of observation.  Objects were in identical flight line, with regular spacing.  Objects were in flight at higher than normal commercial aircraft flight (i.e. well above 35k ft) traveling SW to NE line.;41.2396942148759;-77.0062132231405
