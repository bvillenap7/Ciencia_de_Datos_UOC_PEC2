My husband brothers and I had returned upstate to Tiadaghton State Forest for the first day of doe season.  The night before was a crisp clear cold night. We were standing around the fire, talking, listening to music when my brother called us to, Come look at this!  We went to where my brother was standing and looked to where he was pointing into the sky across and above Rock Run.  We saw an extreamly large triangular shape moving over the ridge of the mountain across from us (McIntyire Mt.).  My husband quickly went and turned the radio and generator off.  The triangular shape continued to slowly follow the top of the mountain. We could clearly see stars in the heavans until this shape moved between us and the stars.  The form was a solid mass that blocked the light from the stars. We all noticed that this huge thing made absolutely no audible sound. I saw that it had three bluish white lights, one on each corner. My brothers also noted a red light.  I did not take notice to a red one. It's hard to put to scale how big this was, but I can tell you my opinion is that it was at the very least the length of two football fields long and one half of that wide.  It dissappeared over the mountain and that was the last time we saw it.  It was unnerving to say the least. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.2396942148759;-77.0062132231405
Triangular object seen passing over Lycoming Mall in Williamsport, Pennsylvania;2002-01-25 18:05:00;10 minutes;Triangular object seen passing over Lycoming Mall in Williamsport, Pennsylvania I was traveling Southeast on Rt. 180 just before the highway turned to 65 MPH.  It was a cobalt blue sky.  I was observing the appearing stars and planets when a bright light caught my eye to the left.  Of course, I figures it was landing lights on a circling plane.  There is a small airport approxamately 4 miles from that location.  As I followed the road,  i lost sight of the light several times.  I hit a long stretch of road.  I saw a red light in front, green on one side, and blue on another.  The light that seemed to be coming from the belly was no longer visible.  I quickly pulled over and rolled down the window.  It was now at an altitude of between 2500 and 3500 feet.  It creeped across the sky, and made no sound.  At that point in time, I was a bit shocked.  I felt a nagging urge to drive on.  I was disturbed that no one else seemed to notice this, or didn't feel the need to invertigate.;41.2396942148759;-77.0062132231405
