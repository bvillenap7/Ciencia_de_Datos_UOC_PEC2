Orange objects near Graterford Prison.;2014-05-04 21:10:00;2-3 minutes;Orange objects near Graterford Prison. I was driving on Bridge St and saw 3 objects.  Lower flying, undetermined shape, orange like street lights.   At first I thought maybe the aircraft that watch Limerick Nuclear Power Station but I've seen them a lot and this wasn't right.  They were flying too fast and random.  Then they seemed to stop.   Then I thought there were 5 not 3 then I only saw 3 again.  They went more to my left then more to my right.  Then they flew east over Graterford Prison and went higher and disappeared.   It was like nothing I've ever seen before.;40.248;-75.4567
