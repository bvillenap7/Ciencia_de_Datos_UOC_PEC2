Two possible UFO's sighted twenty miles west of Philadelphia, Pa.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus and Mars.  PD));2007-09-24 04:15:00;35 minutes;Two possible UFO's sighted twenty miles west of Philadelphia, Pa. I was on my front porch at 4:15 Am this morning. I was smoking a cigarette and looking up at the sky. I noticed a group of lights in a small circle. Then I realized they were red, white and a greenish color, and appeared to be moving in a circular motion and apparently blinking. I watched this for ten minutes or so. I decided to awaken my Wife. She came out and also watched the lights. Suddenly she said Look there's another one. There was another off to the left. Much brighter, and more distinct. Possibly closer to us. We watched them for about 20 minutes. I went out a half hour later and they were gone. I am a professional, in business, a former Sergeant in the Marine Corps. I have a Masters Degree in English. I'm 62 years of age. We've never seen anything like this before, and cannot equate it to anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
