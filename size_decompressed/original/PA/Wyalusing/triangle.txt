Silent, slow, flying aircraft;2006-08-21 22:45:00;10 Minutes;Silent, slow, flying aircraft When we first saw it, it appeared just like a commuter airplane with its landing lights on - very bright white lights in the front center - for its approach to the Wilkes-Barre Scranton Airport - a common sight.  It also had a green flashing light on the right side and a red flashing light on the left side - making it appear like a commercial aircraft.  However, that was not possible as the vehicle was traveling WAY TOO SLOW and Low. It made NO NOISE, possibly a very faint hum for 1-2 seconds.  No engine, jet, or turbo-prop noise whatsoever.  We typically see the Dash 8 fly over from time to time and we can hear it coming.  NOT so with this.  The positions of the lights made the vehicle appear to be triangular in shape.  I would estimate its speed well under 100, more like 50 mph.  That is the first indication I had of something really different was that I was catching up to it as it approached me and I was doing 55.  Thought maybe it was a chopper, but then the lights were spread apart a good distance like an airplane wing so that was not possible.  Then no noise.  My 10 year old son was with me, who also enjoys watching the sky for airplanes and he remarked, without my saying a word, that it appeared to be triangular in shape.  I was in complete denial at this point!  Upon arriving home I searched for slow, low, silent moving aircraft and came upon the tons of articles on the flying triangles.  This surely had all the makings of one.  Oh yes, one additional item I noticed, the flight path followed US RT. 6 - no question on that one.  It came from west to east and I could see from the top of the hill that it was following Rt. 6 and after proceeding to our home, could see it in the distance - flying the same path that US 6 takes.  Amazing!  I would say it was about 1200 feet above us, which would put it at approximately 2500 ft. above sea level.;41.7041;-76.2795
