Orangish-Red lights over Dallas, PA;2012-09-01 22:20:00;2 minutes;Orangish-Red lights over Dallas, PA This is the second appearance of this object in the last few weeks. Appeared to be triangular with orangish-red lights. Two looked to be in line with one another, a third farther off to the right making an obtuse triangle. Was moving in a western direction with no sound. The third light to the right disappeared first, while the other two lights continued westward. Both of them then disappeared. Sky was very overcast with low cloud cover only a handful of stars were visible directly above, no stars could be seen in the direction of the lights.;41.3472;-75.9854
