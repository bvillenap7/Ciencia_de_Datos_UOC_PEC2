Resembled a Star.;2020-07-13 23:00:00;3 minutes;Resembled a Star I live on top of a big hill in our town, and you can see pretty far in all directions.  II went outside at around 11:00 PM because I thought I heard our cat scratching at the door.  When I went out onto our front porch, I noticed that the sky was extremely clear, as we live in a rural area. I saw this “star” from a little ways away, and noticed that it was moving . I assumed it was a plane.  It was coming straight towards my house.  I called my 11 year old son to come outside and watch it with me. When it flew directly over top of my house, I realized it was not a plane. It was very very low, about as low as people normally fly a drone, but there was NO noise. It was dead silent. It was the exact shape, color, and size as a star, but it was moving at a very steady speed, in a completely straight line, and WAY lower. We could not figure out what it was. Our neighbor has a drone, and they are very loud and go all over the place, up or down. I have never witnessed an! ything like this thing before in my life. It was almost like it was on some sort of autopilot. We watched it for as long as we could, and it continued in a perfect straight line, at a consistent speed. Now my son and I are a little disturbed and can’t go to sleep!;41.3395;-80.0525
