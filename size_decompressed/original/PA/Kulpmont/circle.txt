It stayed in the same location for our five minute drive home and then took a 90 degree turn.  Once we arrived at our home, we observed the object in the sky for several more minutes.  The object did not move and continued with an orange glow.  After several minutes it faded away and was gone.  This could not have been a meteor, plane, helicopter, satellite, or the space station as it stayed stationary for approximately 15 mins.  This object was extremely unique and unlike anything we have ever seen in the sky.;40.7913;-76.4705
