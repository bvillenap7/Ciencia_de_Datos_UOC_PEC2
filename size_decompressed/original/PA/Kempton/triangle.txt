Brief glimpse of triangular object, late at night in PA, no explanation.;2009-07-05 03:00:00;Few seconds;Brief glimpse of triangular object, late at night in PA, no explanation. 	It was a cold summer night on hawk mountain and I was still up late.  A few of my friends were up with me and they wanted to go lay in a field to look at the stars.  I stayed behind because I needed to go to sleep.  I remember coming out of my tent to go to the bathroom, and since it’s the middle of the woods on a boy scout reservation why not right outside the tent.  I remember looking down at the tree’s shadows because the moon was very bright that night.   All of the sudden the shadows started to shift sideways, or move as if the moon was setting really fast.  Using logic, I realized the moon cannot be moving that fast and looked up.  I saw a triangular object fly over really close to the tree line, completely silent, with lights similar to Christmas lights surrounding it.  It didn’t look like an entire triangle as I got a pretty close glimpse of the craft.  It looked more like a boomerang, but of course flying straight and not like a boomerang.   This sighting has haunted me for years and to this day I have no idea what it was.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, it truly means a lot.;40.6322;-75.8563
