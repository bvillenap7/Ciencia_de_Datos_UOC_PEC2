Excessive speed of two bright orbs of light traveling SE to NE in arc over Earth.;2013-05-26 21:00:00;3 seconds;Excessive speed of two bright orbs of light traveling SE to NE in arc over Earth. Many airplane flights and occasional helicopter flights pass over my area.  I spend every evening in my solarium and frequently see these objects in flight because their speed is not so excessive that I can't identify them.  These double lights passed over at such speed that I have never witnessed before.   One would miss the lights in the blink of an eye.  They passed from SE to NE.  I've witnessed meteors falling but these lights continued in a flight pattern over the earth.  The lights were simply bright white orbs, not flashing.   I have no knowledge or particular interest in UFO's but the speed and arc of these lights I identified as something I never saw before.;40.6609;-78.2393
