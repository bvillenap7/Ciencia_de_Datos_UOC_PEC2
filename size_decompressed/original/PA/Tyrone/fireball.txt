The light was moving in a foward, zig zag motion when I called a coworker out to look.  I asked him if he thought it was an airplane, and we noticed the firey craft stopped moving in any motion, it was just still.   Approximately 30 seconds later, the light ascended slowly, then literally shot like a sling shot into the sky.  It went from being visible to out of sight in milliseconds.   Was most definitely the most incredible, strangest event I have ever witnessed.   I am a registered nurse, and very skeptical of anything  out of norm.  I cannot say for certain it was a UFO, but I could have no other explanation as to what it was, mostly because of the motions it was taking and how irradically they changed.   I wish I could've run and got my phone to take a video, but I couldn't take my eyes off of it in some weird attraction and awe.;40.6609;-78.2393
