Large orange fireball moving at the speed of a small plane;2011-09-08 20:50:00;2-3 minutes;Large orange fireball moving at the speed of a small plane An orange fireball (almost the size of a full moon) moving about the speed of a small plane appeared in the north sky as my husband and I were in our backyard hottub.  It made no noise at all. We watched it moving south for  about 30 seconds.  While I went iside to get my camera, he said it took a sharp turn west.  We lost sight of it due to houses and trees before I was able to snap a photo.;41.1408;-77.444
