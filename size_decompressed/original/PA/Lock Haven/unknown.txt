Being that this area has an airport we thought it was a plane heading for landing.  this is not a big airport so a long stand by for landing was not probable.  the object appeared to move closer and farther away, and changes in color happened quite frequently.  it moved up/down and left/right in a smooth and quick manner and did not appear to follow any pattern normally seen in a satellite, plane, or falling star.  the object was watched by 3-4 people for upto 1 hour until it moved to a point out of vision range behing a mountain on the horizon.  intensity of the light changed frequently and dimming of the light on the object was followed by bright flashes of light along the horizon for quite a distance.  during the time object was visible periodic flashes of light around the object were noticed in different colors.;41.1408;-77.444
