Black rectangle heading westward.;2013-09-14 23:40:00;30 seconds;Black rectangle heading westward. Saw object while just idly staring at moon.  Noticed the moon's usual halo seemed to bend around at an odd angle, deduced it was roughly square.  Looked at it, noticed it was a darker black than the night sky (I live downtown in Lock Haven).  Object began moving west, first slow, then faster.  Then I lost track of it.;41.1408;-77.444
