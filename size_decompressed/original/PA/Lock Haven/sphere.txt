Large, orange sphere spotted 2 miles north of Lock Haven, PA;2009-01-13 03:00:00;2 min.;Large, orange sphere spotted 2 miles north of Lock Haven, PA I woke up at 3 a.m. and happened to glance out the window where I witnessed a large, bright, orange-colored sphere in the north that moved slowly from west to east about 45 degrees above the horizon.  It was about a half a mile away. It was about three or four times the size of the largest planet that I've seen.  My husband also witnessed the last 20 secs. as it continued on towards the east until it was out of our sight. I wasn't able to hear any sounds because I was inside, and I didn't have my binoculars handy to get a closer look.;41.1408;-77.444
