Diamond Shaped, covered with lights, Approximately 200 feet in the air.;2000-05-18 21:00:00;10 minutes;Diamond Shaped, covered with lights, Approximately 200 feet in the air. I was travelling west on Interstate 80 near a rest stop before Brookville, PA. In the sky, very low, was  a diamond shaped object completely covered with smaller white lights. This object would have been slightly larger than a full moon. It was very overcast, but no rain. There were many cars pulled off the road viewing this object. I and a friend left after 10 minutes of viewing this object. There must be others that have reported this, because it was just too obvious. No Noise what so ever!;41.1638;-79.0818
