Intense ball of bright white light fly-over Trafford, PA.;2011-08-11 09:15:00;3 min.;Intense ball of bright white light fly-over Trafford, PA. The object appeared as a round, intense white light (brighter than daylight which is measured as 6400 degrees calvin).  Estimated about 12-15,000 ft., moving from southwest to north east, night sky was clear.  I was first to see it travelling in a straight line, perpendicular to any plane routes, no audible sound, no vapor trail.  There was a plane much higher, which was a spec and I could see a slight vapor trail. My wife saw it, too, but said it must be a plane. But, there were no lights or flashers, just intense bright light.  I observed it through a pair of 7X35 (358ft. at 1000 yds.) binoculars. It was the size of the head-of-a-pin.  It flew over, stopped a split second and resumed on course until out of sight.  As it got further away there still were no indication of marker lights/flashers. No photos.;40.3852;-79.7171
