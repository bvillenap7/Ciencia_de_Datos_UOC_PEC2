Several dozen orange lights in the sky over North Versailles Pa on July 13, 2012, around 21:15 hours;2012-07-13 21:15:00;5 minutes;Several dozen orange lights in the sky over North Versailles Pa on July 13, 2012, around 21:15 hours I was travelling eastbound on US Route 30 in North Versailles Pa. near the intersection with PA Route 48.  Out of my driver-side window,I noticed in the sky above what first appeared to me as a flight of military helicopters with their search lights on and pointing forward.  The light, however, was orange,like from a sodium vapor lamp, not white like a helicopter light, and the light appeared on top of the objects and not to their front, as a search light or a car headlight would be aimed.  The objects that eminated this orange light appeared also to be flying in formation, possibly 1000 feet+ above the ground.  They were travelling in a west-southwesterly direction and crossed over US Route 30 directly above me at a speed similar to a helicopter or small plane.  There apeared to be several objects in a group, and several groups, one coming after another. These objects were flying in formation and their flight path was straight and unwavering.  There had to be at ! least several dozen objects as described herein in this sighting. I turned off my car radio and wound down my window to hear the helicopter rotors but was very surprised to hear absolutely no noise at all.  The objects were flying low enough to observe that they appeared to have an opaque base with a somewhat conical orange light located above the base.  If not helicopters, I thought they could possibly be balloons, but I cannot figure out how they all would have been lighted in exactly the same manner and flying in formations.   I have never seen anything like this and am very confused about what these strange lights could have been.;40.3767;-79.8112
My wife and I saw 6 moving objects near spout of Big Dipper;2014-06-16 23:00:00;~1 hour;My wife and I saw 6 moving objects near spout of Big Dipper My wife and I saw 6 moving objects (one at a time over a period of about an hour) which start out looking like a bright star, then fade to red and finally disappear.  They do not have any strobe lights like planes do.  They are moving faster than what you see planes moving but not as fast as a shooting star.  Most were heading west to east, one north to south and one was traveling west to east but turned 90 degrees and went north.  Saw in the area close to the tip of the spout of the “Big Dipper”.;40.3767;-79.8112
3 moving lights headed west.;2014-07-01 22:15:00;1 minute;3 moving lights headed west 3 objects observed tonight. 2 heading west and 1 north-west.  Started out as a white light (like a star).  Moved steadily as they changed to a burnt red color until they just fade out.   Only saw one at a time for under a minute each.  This was over a period of about ½ hour starting at about 22:15.;40.3767;-79.8112
3 lights heading north and one flashing light in the north.;2014-07-14 22:40:00;40 minutes;3 lights heading north and one flashing light in the north 7/14/14 @ 10:40pm, 11:05pm and 11:18pm.  An object that is bright white like a star, moving north.  It fades out to a brunt red color. Then it would get bright white again and fade to red then out and repeat.  All 3 of the objects acted the same and all three had a flight path that took them by the first star of the handle of the Big Dipper.  The 4th object seen was to the north at about 11:22pm. It was simply a flashing light.  It alternated between 21 seconds and 10 seconds between flashes.  I never saw it move.  The flash was always in the same place.  Then it just quit flashing.;40.3767;-79.8112
