Odd triangle of lights moving together  near York Springs, PA;2011-10-16 20:20:00;unknown;Odd triangle of lights moving together  near York Springs, PA Heading west, we were returning from a high school basketball scrimmage, when we saw lights in a triangular pattern (kind of a white/red blinking color)  appeared in sky directly above road (Rt 234).  Wasn't sure of what we were looking at at first, but it was not tower lights and not airplane lights.  We slowed as we approached and the triangle of lights seemded to go a bit north of the road, then lower closer to a corn field.  No sound at all.  Very odd. Not certain, but I think there was at least another light when we first saw triangle, but that other light disappeared as we focused attention on triangle of lights (thought it might be helicopters but there was no copter noise). After getting home, looked up ufo triangle lights and some of the videos we saw on youtube were EXACTLY what we saw.   Very strange.
