It was around 11pm when 2 flying objects were witnessed. At first, a small circular aircraft with blinking red lights hovered above the treeline and moved irregularly across the sky. I followed its movements until I saw another, this time much larger in size. It was enormous and elongated, like a saucer, with a row of bright red lights. Almost immediately the object flew straight up, took a hard left turn, and while hovering angled, beamed a bright yellow light at my fiance and I for a couple of seconds. It was so bright that I froze in my spot. The light was coming from 3 panels on the aircraft. The yellow beam of light stopped and the object started moving irregularly in the same direction as the blinking red lights  until it became as small as the first object.;40.3322;-78.4485
