Never seen anything like that before I was driving on the turnpike with my family and noticed about 5 or 6 objects descending from the sky all at the same time and one flying diagonal towards the other one. I donâ€™t know what it is but I never seen anything like that before, it is just a strange thing that was happening. I tried searching the internet to see if there was a space launch or something happening that day but came back with no results of anything.;40.107;-75.3355
