Odd craft over Milford, PA;2009-07-13 17:15:00;5 seconds;Odd craft over Milford, PA I was out using a new camera and in the first frame of 4 taken (all about 4 seconds apart) in the same spot I have an odd object way up in the sky. It appears to be oval and metallic with some sort of red emitting from the bottom. I didn't see it until I looked at the frames at home.;41.3258999999999;-74.8773000000001
