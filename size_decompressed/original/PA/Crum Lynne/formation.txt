12 nickle size yellow,orange, white lights by US 13 in Delaware county Pa;2021-04-07 21:20:00;15 seconds;12 nickle size yellow,orange, white lights by US 13 in Delaware county Pa This happened near the train tracks about 3 blocks from US 13 (Chester Pk) and Fairview ave roughly 2 miles from Chester Pa. very near I 95. I am repeating exactly what my girlfriend just told me, then spoke to both again while writing this to be sure of details. I went to look but hey were gone by time I got there about 10 minutes later Female in her 50s was driving her 13 year old son back from shopping, coming down Fairview towards US13. A block before the tracks they both saw twelve bright orange (mango), white, and yellow lights with no glare slightly larger then a nickle held at arms length. They were in a loose circular pattern, just sat there at about 2,000 feet, possibly little lower between US13 and the tracks. After about 15 seconds of watching they got scared and drove the other way. No other people or cars were in the area. Normally that would be extremely weird but this is the Covid year so hard to say. The lights match nothing we can think of and we are all very familiar with all lights in area. She has lived roughly 1/4 mile from where they were for about 20 years, and I for about 8. We live along a flight path into Philadelphia Airport, it or they were not planes. Light was very different, colors wrong,lower and larger. She had no interest in UFOs before this and was visibly shaken, son also less then thrilled. I, who wasn't there am interested so am writing this to the best of my ability;39.8646;-75.3358
