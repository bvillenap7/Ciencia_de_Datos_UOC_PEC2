Between 9:30-10:00 PM there was a VERY bright light with a smaller light on each side above cloud level in the West by NW.  It did not move but went on and off about every two minutes. Lights were above cloud level close to but not in regular flight paths into Philadelphia International Airport.  It was not a airplane and did not have red or green nav. lights.  Bright enough that many must have seen.    I just spoke to a neighbor who also saw the same BRIGHT light in same part of the sky last night 5/11/15;39.8646;-75.3358
