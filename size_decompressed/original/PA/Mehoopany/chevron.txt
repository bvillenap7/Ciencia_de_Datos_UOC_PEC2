2 UFOs spotted over Mehoopany PA.;2002-09-09 09:30:00;15 min;2 UFOs spotted over Mehoopany PA. I was at work rigging scafolding which we placeing on the roof with a crane. I loked up to see the load being placed on the roof when I saw the craft. It looked at first like a big peice of paper floating in the sky then it stoped moving and just hovered. It was at the about the same altitude as pasenger planes fly over that area. Next the craft started making realy quick movments and stoping.This is when I said something to the crane operator. He got out of the crane and I told him to look up in the sky and, verify what I was seeing. At first he said it was a plane. Then the craft started make the realy quick movments again. The crane operator then said that is no plane! And I do not even want to know what it is. We watched tthe craft for anther 5 minutes or so when the craft made realy big movment horizontialy. Just then another craft flew by the original craft and out of sight. The original craft made like a real quick circle and followed the other craft out of sight. I was i the military for 6 years and I never saw anything make that quick of a movment or fly that fast.;41.5576;-76.1063
