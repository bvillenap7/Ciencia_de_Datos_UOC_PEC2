In between Davidsville and Jerome,  we spotted a redish orange light in the distance and watched it eventually pass over our car following 219 North East.   Once the object was behind us, the light was not visible anymore.;40.2228;-78.9403

I saw two star-like objects moving quickly and erratically around the sky.  One of these objects seemed to be chasing the other one through the sky, just slightly behind it.  They looked just a tad dimmer than the stars around them, and there was no blinking emitting from them like there is on a plane or satellite.  They were so dim, they would occasionally fade out of my sight and then reappear.  They were moving in no set pattern, and they would change direction randomly.  I followed them for a span of about five minutes, where they then passed underneath the handle of the Big Dipper and then disappeared. I’ve seen this same exact thing around four other times: two star-like objects seemingly chasing each other randomly in the sky before disappearing.  I’m an astrophotographer, so I am always out under the night sky and observing the stars very closely.  I know when I see things that are planes, drones, helicopters, or satellites.  This recurring instance is not comprised of any of these.  I’m very familiar with the night sky, and this is something that I genuinely cannot wrap my head around.;40.2228;-78.9403
