Out with my family watching fireworks.  When someone noticed an oranges reddish colored light moving toward the firework display.   It came in at a steady smooth speed, but as it got closer the light dimmed and it got to a very small fine light as it was almost on top of where they were lighting off their fireworks it stopped approaching and simply went straight back like reverse in a car.   Now I have done a lot of research and have yet to find anything that can reverse in mid-air.;40.2965;-78.3292
