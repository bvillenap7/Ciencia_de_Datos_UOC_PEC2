June 10th, 2011 Approx. 9:22 PM   LOCATION 1  First observed: Lat: 40.661494 N Lon: 77.514793 W Altitude: 668 ft. Bearing: 241 T  LOCATION 2 Object Appeared Straight Above (slightly to right):  Lat: 40.663417 N Lon: 77.510729 W  Altitude: 662 ft. Bearing: 241 T  LOCATION 3 No longer visible (obstructed view due to rear of vehicle): Lat:  40.66138 N Lon: 77.504088 W Altitude: 684 Bearing: 241 T    Approaching Location 1 in an East/NE direction on Old Stage Road, while riding in the passenger seat of our vehicle, I observed a bright red light in the sky straight ahead and slightly to the right of our line of site.  It was high enough that it appeared to be well above the ridgetops.  At first sight, I commented that it was likely a helicopter, as it appeared to be suspended and stationary.  I further commented that it could have been an airplane flying directly toward us, as it again, appeared to be stationary.  It appeared to be yawing slightly as we watched it get closer. As we continued to drive toward the object, it became apparent that it was stationary, and that we would soon be closing in proximity, that the object would be readily visible out the passenger side window.  At or near LOCATION 2, I stuck my head out to see the object in a position that seemed to be nearly directly above my head, and slightly off to the right side of the vehicle.  From this vantage point, the object appeared to be lower than I had first observed or estimated.  It seemed to be 100-200 feet off of the ground.  It looked like a fiery ball.  It had a bright white ball-shaped center and 3 points of red, triangular light extending outward from the center, almost like a pinwheel.  It appeared as something burning and I expected to see smoke or hear crackling, but heard no sound from the object, nor was there any visible smoke. Quickly, our vehicle, which was traveling at approx. 45 mph, seemed to be pulling away from the object.  From this vantage point it seemed to be at a fixed height and position and our relative velocity in the vehicle was clearly far greater than that of the object, as it appeared fixed in position.  I had to maintain my head out of the window to see it from the rear vantage point of our vehicle.  I was afraid my glasses would blow off, so I pulled my head in and looking out the back window, I could see that it was still visible and close to the ground.  At that point (LOCATION 3), the object was out of view due to the tree line and direction of the road. I don’t know what it was, but I’ve never seen anything like it. In retrospect, it appeared similar to a firework that was ready to burst, but did not move or traverse or explode. It was just hanging in the sky, very close to the ground. The sighting and experience were so mysterious and compelling that my son and I drove back from our home, a few minutes (approx. 20 minutes) later to see if the object was still there.  It was not.  However, as we turned and drove back home over the same stretch of highway, we estimated the locations where we observed the object, and I recorded the locations as waypoints on my GPS device.  Those GPS readings are shown above.;40.5992;-77.5768
