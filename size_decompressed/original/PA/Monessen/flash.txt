Yellow bright light balls appearing and disappearing ,then reappearing , miles away in night sky.;2018-07-18 23:00:00;30-45 seconds;yellow bright light balls appearing and disappearing ,then reappearing , miles away in night sky. I was looking out at the western sky, from back deck of house and a bright round flashball appeared in the western sky.  It was cloudy and overcast and the stars were mostly not visible due to the cloud cover.  I have a pretty good knowledge of what various aircraft look like at night and the sounds that they give off,along with how thwy are capable of moving and how quickly they should move across the night sky.  this was soundless, appeared for a second and then suddenly the same exact light is then, i am estimating, popping up 3-5 miles away, BRIGHTLY again,then vanishes,and is way over in the opposite direction in a different spot...This will go on for four to six times then i saw a vague streak and in a matter of seconds the flash id over the horizon and gone. my wife and i have seen this phenomenon at least 5 times already,this month and cant get a photo or video cause i dont know where its going to pop up when it reappears ! each time.  its incredibly fast,quiet, and unexpectedly bright considering the clouds almost completely obscure any satellite or prominent stars from being clearly seen at all.  I did not know how to answer the quantity question, because its unclear to me if its one item jumping around the sky or a group of them less than in this instance.;40.1502;-79.8792
