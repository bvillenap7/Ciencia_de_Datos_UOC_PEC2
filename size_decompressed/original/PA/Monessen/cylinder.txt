Probe Flourescent Bulb Sized Object.;1970-03-12 03:00:00;10 minutes;Probe Flourescent Bulb Sized Object I got up in the middle of the night and smoked a cigarette while looking out of the kitchen windnow. There were no lights on in surrounding houses. In the small valley where my dad's house was located, I saw a light come over the hill.  This light proceeded in an oblong route - only stopping at the top of large pine trees periodically.  When at top of the pine trees, it would turn off and on about every 3-4 seconds. At this time I awoke my mother to see this thing.  I passed in front of the windowabout five (5) feet away. At this time , I observed that it was about four feet long - and about the size of a flourescent light bulb. Behind the object it appeared to give off an exhaust of light.  The object was traveling about 5 mph.  Although the light appeared intense, it didn't seem to illuminate objects it passed. I've wondered all these years what his was. . .a probe. .. ?  I'd appreciate hearing if any other reports have encountered such an object.;40.1502;-79.8792
