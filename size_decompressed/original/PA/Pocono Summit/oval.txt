((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of ISS.  PD))  White Oval Floating Light;2005-11-02 17:45:00;4 Minutes;White Oval Floating Light At 5:45 PM ET on 11-2-05, I was in my front yard putting the cover on car when I looked up and saw a bright round white light moving very slowly. It was moving from West to East.  After looking at it for a few seconds I realized it was something unusual. I ran in my house and grabbed my binoculars and now was standing on my back porch. As the object came over my house and back into view I looked at it through the binoculars and I could see only a perfectly round white object. It had no blinking aviation lights and was moving extremely slow like it was gliding or floating. I heard absolutely no noise for as a plane at that height of which I estimate to be between 4,000 and 10,000 feet I would have heard. The light did not change in hue or intensity no matter what angle on the horizon the object moved. The shade of white also did not resemble a plane's lights. As if flew over my house and was now 30 degrees in the sky and flying away from me, the light started to fade, not turn off but get dimmer and dimmer (in a cloudless clear sky) and then disappeared with no other lights visible. What was strange was 3 things. First there was only one bright perfectly round white light with no other aviation lights, 2./It moved extremely slow at the level it was at-It seemed that it was moving so slow that a plane couldn't have flew that slow and finally 3./there was absolutely no noise at the altitude it was at. I had realized within about 2 seconds that this was not a plane. As to what it was, I don't know just that it was unusual. And it is good to know that there are still things in life that can make you wonder. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of International Space Station.
