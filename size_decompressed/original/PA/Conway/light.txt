Strange Red & White Lighted Object Moving through Night Sky;2015-08-28 20:50:00;3 minutes;Strange Red & White Lighted Object Moving through Night Sky Looked up and saw a strange object in sky.  It had bright red and white lights almost like vehicle lights.  It was moving very slowly from northeast to southwest.   It slowly moved across the sky then stopped and the bright lights went out, it continued to hover with very dim lights for a good minute maybe more, then a smaller bright light came out of it's right side and flew off to the east, at this point the original object began to move north without turning the brighter lights back on.   It finally faded out and I could not see it anymore.   I had one witness who saw the first part which was the bright lights and the slow movement, they did not see the smaller light fly out of it.;40.6665;-80.2378
