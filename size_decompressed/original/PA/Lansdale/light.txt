Orange lights in the sky with aircraft flying around them;2012-01-19 19:25:00;10 minutes;Orange lights in the sky with aircraft flying around them My daughter and I were driving down Valley Forge Rd. at 7:20. She pointed out two white large lights in the sky. one was directly above the other.  They would move closer to each other until almost touching and then move apart again. They did this about five times and then the lower one flew away.  Then, up the road where the trees thin out and much more of the sky is visible there were about 10 orange orbs floating in different places just hovering. I pulled over to watch them and then we noticed places flying all around the lights.  They weren't normal passenger planes they were triangular in shape and loud.  There were probably at least 20 planes flying all around the hovering lights.  I wanted to stay and watch because it was so pretty but we were going to an appointment. When we came out of the appointment everything was gone.  I have never seen anything like that before and while I was watching it I was in awe.;40.2363;-75.2960000000001
Two bright lights connected low in altitude with rapid varied movements.;2014-02-21 18:00:00;5 seconds;Two bright lights connected low in altitude with rapid varied movements. I was pulling out of my development at 6 pm on my way to work and directly in front of me, in what was a clearing sky because we had just had some heavy rains, I saw what looked like two bright lights approx 100 or so feet in altitude.  The two lights appeared to be connected together horizontally.  Imagine a traffic light sideways without the yellow and they were very bright.  One was red and the other green.   The lights moved together in sharp vertical and horizontal and diagonal movements.  I heard no sounds from this.   I really had no idea what I was looking at but considered it could possibly be a remote control operated toy I guess but it just seemed rather an odd time as it had just recently stopped raining and I also had never seen any remote controlled toys like that.   If I had seen an associated shape to it I might consider the toy option more but it was really just the two bright lights.;40.2363;-75.2960000000001
