Orange orbs in sky.;2014-06-13 21:10:00;2-4 minutes;Orange orbs in sky While driving on Line Street in Lansdale, near Lansdale Hospital, approximately 9:10 p.m., saw two fireball objects, or orange orbs, heading toward Main Street.  They seemed to be moving slowly or hovering but then would pick up in speed.  They would change directions, and then suddenly disappeared.   Next, two more fireballs or orange orbs shot up and moved at a very fast speed but then seemed to slow down and float or hover.   They made no noise and were about 500 feet high in the sky.   We stopped our car and watched the objects move out of sight.   All occurred in about two to four minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
