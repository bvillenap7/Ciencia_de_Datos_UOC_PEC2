white teardrop;2001-09-12 00:30:00;minutes;white teardrop I was on my deck talking to a friend on the phone. I saw what I thought were some very bright stars and as I looked at them I wasn't sure if they were stars, they seemed brighter and looked like they were grouped together in the shape of a perfect triangle. I am not much of a sky watcher so I just thought I had never noticed this before. As I was looking at them one of them suddenly shot across the sky it looked like a white tear drop, then it was gone. This was too large to be a shooting star.what I had thought was a star I was looking at before I saw the white tear drop was then gone. There was no sound and no colored lights. I have never seen anything like it and it was not like anything I have ever heard of. This was Sept 11/01 and you can be sure there were no airplanes in the sky that night.
