Winged Being and Ufo Sighting in PA.;1996-06-12 12:00:00;30 minutes;Winged Being and Ufo Sighting in PA When I was younger me my mom and 2 brothers where walking in the woods, My mom would sometimes take us for walks,  We seen what appeared to be a very old man in a black cloak standing next to one of them ground electric boxes they are green like 4ft by 4ft square,   When we got near him it turned looked at us then took off vertically into the sky and the black cloak appeared to be black wings or a fabric that resembled wings,   Its description is 7 ft tall pale skin very fit with a very old looking face and with black wings looked like what would think as a fallen angel but I am not sure what it was,   A few days later my mom and me where sitting on the front steps to our house and looked up in the sky and there was a triangle craft with 3 lights hovering for about a minute and then took off and then never seen the being or the ufo again.;40.2363;-75.2960000000001
Low, slow, nealy silent delta wing 'airliner.';2003-11-11 19:00:00;30 seconds;Low, slow, nealy silent delta wing 'airliner.' Location:  Suburban Philadelphia, PA USA  Environment:  Mostly clear sky, after sundown, light breeze  Witnesses:  (2) Male - 25, Male - 55  Aircraft:  One triangular/delta wing shaped object of airliner size at an altitude of not greater than 800 ft (more likely below 500 ft) making very little noise and traveling very slowly (150MPH estimated).  -Shape- Triangular in shape, although not a 'triangle.'  The outline was distinctly a delta wing configuration and there was a clearly visible fuselage.  The best example of the shape is the old F16 Delta Wing concept.  No rear mounted horizontal stabilizers and a clean, straight trailing edge to the main wing.  No forward mounted horizontal stabilizers were visible either.  Two vertical stabilizers were visible, ruling out many possible aircraft types that fit the 'basic' shape (B2, etc).  The total wingspan of the 'delta wing' was longer than the totall length of the aircraft.  -Lighting- Very familiar lighting pattern.  Red, white, and blue lights on the wing, nose, wing, respectively, as one would see on a normal airliner, but the lights were in the wrong places.  The wing tip lights were 'too far back' to denote a typical airliner.  No other visible running lights.  No strobe effect or color changes.  -Size- Large.  737 size at least.  -Position- Altitude between 500 ft and 800 ft AGL.  Traveling from ENE to WSW.  -Speed- Very, very slow.  Best guess is between 150-200MPH - if that.  -Sound- Astonishingly quiet.  The exhaust note was more similar to a constant gust of wind than a jet engine.  Description of Event:  Standing outside home talking.  During the converasation, the lights of an 'airliner' were visible approaching from over the roof of the house across the street.  Initially, the size, speed and altitude through me off.  The aircraft traveled in our direction, although very slowly.  As it came nearer, its outline was visible against the stars and moonlight.  The aircraft resembled a typical airliner in lighting patterns only - and only at a distance.  It was apparent when the aircraft flew overhead that the lights were in the wrong positions as the wingtip running lights were at the trailing edge of the aircraft - too far back.  The delta wing shape became visible at roughly the same time, which sparked my interest as I moved a few feet down the driveway to keep the aircraft in view longer.  Other obervations made during this time (~30 seconds from initial view to passing over house) were the flight charectaristics.  The altitude of the aircraft was very abnormal for my area.  Philadelphia Int'l airport does not have traffic patterns over my area and even if they did, an approaching aircraft would still be well above 10,000 feet as the airport is a good 45 miles away.  The local NAS operates mostly C130's, A10's, and the occassional F18.  The altitude of the aircraft was almost enough to make me duck - it appeared that the aircraft would be landing no more than 1000 yards away based on this as well as the speed.  The speed again reinforced the idea that the aircraft was landing somewhere very close by.  At rougly 150 odd MPH, you would expect an airliner size aircraft to be seconds away from touchdown, full flaps, etc.  Except this aircraft kept on going straight and level until it disappeared from view over treetops 500 yards away.  The sound was the last abnormal charectaristic of the aircraft - there really wasnt any.  The aircraft engines sounded more like a sustained gust of wind than a jet or prop engine.  At that alitude, one would expect even a civilian airliner to drown out the conversation, let alone a military aircraft, but the aircraft was so quiet that we were able to speak to eachother while observing it.  Reason for reporting: Was advised to do so.  There is no single aspect that stands out about this aircraft - but the sum of all the aspects made this an interesting experience.  The combination of 'way' too low, 'way' too slow, 'way' too quiet, and shaped like the old British Avro Vulcan were enough for me to question what, exactly, the aircraft was because I know of no civilian or military aircraft that exibits this combination of charectaristics.;40.2363;-75.2960000000001
Triangle ufo (tr-3b) low hovering, many witnesses;2011-02-10 19:00:00;unknown;Triangle ufo (tr-3b) low hovering, many witnesses Driving west on rt. 63 past hatfield meat company with my girlfriend.  We both saw a low hovering, huge, silent, triangle shaped ufo.  Perfect triangle, three round white lights at each point.  It was rotating clockwise veeeeery slowly in place.  The back? along the outside in between two of the white lights were two smaller blinking red lights.  I remember thinking..those look like airplane lights almost.  We kept driving.  There was a tractor trailer parked on the side of the road, the guy outside his truck watching it.  Had to be probably 100 to 200 feet above the ground.  This link to youtube is the EXACT thing we witnessed only in the area described above.  People calling it a tr-3b  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-8jD7nx0LU;40.2363;-75.2960000000001
Triangle shape covered In Blue white lights on pa turnpike;2017-10-28 06:40:00;20 minutes;Triangle shape covered In Blue white lights on pa turnpike I am a truck driver and was driving on PA turnpike back from Philadelphia on 476 north somewhere close to 6:40 AM.  Close to lansdale there was a bright blue and white light about 1500 feet In the air.  shaped  like a boomerang like triangle with a line like a tail Hanging down from the middle.  The entire object was covered in extremely bright blue white  lights just hovering in the air.  There were five of them each about 5 miles apart spread out along 476 as I drove towards quakertown.  Each strange object had the same shape and bright lights hovering still above the turnpike and each was about five miles apart from the next.;40.2363;-75.2960000000001
