5 slow moving glowing objects in the sky.;2013-11-05 18:45:00;3 minutes;5 slow moving glowing objects in the sky. My son and I were driving home on Sumneytown Pike at 6:45 PM when I saw 4 really bright glowing orange dots about 20 degrees above the horizon.   Knowing something was up we quickly found a place to park [nearby school with no trees to block our view] and got out to investigate.  Objects were moving very slowly, very bight, seemed to have faint flicker almost like a burned out firework.   After the initial 4 dimmed out of view I looked straight up to see a 5th.  My son quickly got out his ipod and got what we could on video but the video does not do it any justice. My nearest guess would be a very slow moving space object barely catching the outer atmosphere and not completely burning up.;40.2363;-75.2960000000001
