The object had an unapparent shape and was shining bright white and orange as if to blind a person from seeing what it actually looked like but not so bright that it would catch ones attention. It came to the left of us going south. it was maybe 300-400 feet away and about 250 400 feet in the air on the left side of the highway like a bat out of hell, stopped dead in its tracks. Hovered in place for a second, then like is taking a looking around and sped back the way it came in a speed that was like a ray of light.;40.2363;-75.2960000000001
