At approximately 11 P.M. on Saturday September 2 ,2012 in Verona ,PA [5 miles outside of Pittsburgh] myself and 5 other people were outside of a restaurant /bar in the parking lot walking to enter the establishment.  We suddenly noticed  an orange , glowing, pulsating fireball object in the sky.  It was slowly moving soundlessly across the sky, about the height of a high flying helicopter.  After about 5 minutes it just vanished.  Then coming from the same direction that it originally came from, were two more identical flying objects.These also moved soundlessly ,slowly  and steadily across the night sky until they just vanished before our eyes. The objects appeared to be flaming and pulsating.  One person took a video with his cell phone. The object appeared differently when looking at the video, as the orange flaming colors were not there.  It appeared to be a circular white object on the video, but it still showed the PULSATION very clearly.  I took a picture with my cellphone camera. One other thing of possible interest. Due to the full moon, we could see many chemtrails in the sky...and a few people in the group thought they saw pulsating white “stars” off in the distance. As far as a description of the observers, my friend and I are musicians, and the other four people were not friends , just fellow customers of the restaurant. We all saw the same thing.;40.491;-79.8415
