My daughter and i walked out of Applebees restaurant in Ephrata, Pa. It was around 7  P.M. Dec. 22nd, 2011. We looked over the horizon and noticed a red circle of bright light in the sky. As it flew up it would shift in color to an orange glowing orb.  We looked back to the point of origin and another red one was coming. As it flew up it also shifted into an orange glowing orb. This would happen six more times until there were 8 total glowing orange orbs or circles in a diagonal formation.  There were about 20 other observers with cell phone cameras gazed on what we were experiencing. Two of the orbs stopped and waited for two others to take the lead. The four orbs then sped up and twinkled out. The other four orbs remained and then finally twinkled out themselves.;40.1750000000001;-76.1816999999998
