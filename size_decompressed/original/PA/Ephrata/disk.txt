The UFO was definitely not a plane, because it had at least 10 different LARGE flashing lights of different colors (red,green,orange).  It was silver and saucer-shaped.   Also, it looked like it was moving WAY more fast than a regular plane.   Plus it made extremely weird and loud buzzing noise.  The UFO looked like it was close to the ground.  Definitley not a plane.  Very scary and strange.;40.1750000000001;-76.1816999999998
Ship came through a wormhole, changed colors very fast, left.;2014-10-08 05:30:00;17 seconds;Ship came through a wormhole, changed colors very fast, left. On Oct. 8th, at around 5:30 am, my wife son & I went outside our home to view the blood moon eclipse.  I decided to video it on my galaxy3 phone.  The sky was black not a star, plane etc., to be seen.  11 seconds into my video, an object suddenly appeared, as if through a wormhole.  Within less than 2 seconds it was gone.   I did a frame-by-frame evaluation on my phone, and was AMAZED!  It came out bright white changed to red & yellow with 5 visible lights always staying parellel to the moon.  In some of the pics you can actually see a gray metallic saucer shape with the 5 white lights. Definitely is a U.F.O., and i am glad we witnessed it and videoed it.;40.1750000000001;-76.1816999999998
