I was standing on my deck overlooking the valley and saw what appeared to be an orange/yellow ball hovering over the hill on the opposite side of the valley.  It hovered there for about 15 seconds then slowly climbed vertically almost to the height of the clouds over the next 30 seconds where it paused for about 15 seconds.  Then it just disappeared.  It did not fade or fall back towards earth or climb higher out of sight, it was not a plane that changed course so that I was unable to see the lights.  It was as if someone hit a switch and turned off the light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.1750000000001;-76.1816999999998

There were no sounds coming from it and then four more appeared.  They were moving at a decent speed, then vanished. Pretty weird.;40.1750000000001;-76.1816999999998
