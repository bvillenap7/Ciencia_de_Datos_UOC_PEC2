Bright lights, low.;2015-11-12 19:55:00;1 minute;Bright lights low. I was traveling towards Sauder Eggs and I saw what I believed to be an airplane with three very bright lights. I was watching as I moved toward it to see of it was traveling towards the airport.  I thought it was moving very fast.  Faster than a normal plane. Suddenly it changed direction and I lost sight of it.  It reappeared right in front of me as I approached, the end of the road.  It appeared to be hovering but I couldn't tell because it was soo bright. The lights were so bright they blinded me. It was very low to the ground.  I got freaked out and turned right.  I didn't see it again.;40.1750000000001;-76.1816999999998
