Seven Lights In A Triangular Shape Sighted Over Indiana, Pennsylvania;2005-07-11 23:45:00;10 Seconds;Seven Lights In A Triangular Shape Sighted Over Indiana, Pennsylvania Tonight after work I got home and went for an evening dip in my pool with a couple of my roommates.  While in the pool, because it was such a clear night, we were looking up at the stars in the night sky.  There was the occaisional airplane that we saw (which isn't uncommon because we have an airport not 5 miles from our house), and just plain old stars and such...but nothing too special.  Then, from the corner of my eye, I caught something moving across the night sky from south to north.  What I saw was seven lights in a boomerang-type shape floating through the sky.  There were three lights on each side of the boomerang, and one at the point of it.  They were all white in color.  What struck me as odd was that they appeared to be dimmed...as if they were made so to avoid detection.  None of the lights on the craft wavered or blinked at all.  They were all steady lights.  If anybody saw what I saw tonight, please post. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.6189367346939;-79.1580693877552
Tringular object with three lights seen passing from east to west over Indiana, PA at 9:30 PM EST;2006-08-10 21:25:00;10 Minutes;Tringular object with three lights seen passing from east to west over Indiana, PA at 9:30 PM EST I was going to leave my house on Ringneck Ave. in Indiana, PA at around 9:30 as I walked outside a bright orange light was glowing over the trees at a distance of about 5 miles from me in the sky. I thought at first it was a planet in the sky so I stared at it to figure out which one, but I noticed a slight wobble to it. It appeared to be moving slowly towards me. It was in the eastern sky at the time I first noticed it. As I watched I tried to squint to make out anything thinking it was maybe a helicopter, but when I squinted it seemed to have an odd shape to it, and it was not blinking like a normal helicopter was. About 2 minutes later my mother came out and asked what I was looking at, I pointed the object out and said it seemd odd. At this time it was getting closer. At about 9:30 PM at this point the object was getting closer and you could see visible horizontal movement as the object got closer to us. It took about 2 minutes from that point to reach a point where we could see it visible moving at a fast pace. It was completely silent, and almost looked like a cruise ship moving in the sky how it was floating by. As it got closer the front had a bright orange light on it, which is what I assume I could see from the distance originally. I coult also make out two lighter lights behing it tailing it. These lights formed a triangular shape. The shape was an elongated traingle the front was about 3 times the disance from the back two lights were apart. At this point the object passed directly over the house and you could visibly make out a very dark black shape of a trangle with two lights on the back, one on the front and what looked like smaller lights around the side of it as it passed.  It continued to move to the west passing over the hill behind our house. It took about 1 minute to pass from where we could make it out to where it was no longer visible. There was no noise at all coming from the object.;40.6189367346939;-79.1580693877552
((HOAX??  Contact information is flawed.))  A solid green triangular light sped across the sky, stopped, and continued again.;2013-06-03 00:15:00;20 seconds;A solid green triangular light sped across the sky, stopped, and continued again. While sitting outside enjoying a fire with friends (no drugs or alcohol involved.  All witnesses were sober)  We were observing the stars reminiscing about an old astronomy class.  A moving bright light, similar to the size of a dime held out at arms length started moving methodically across the sky from West to East.   The light was solid, but triangular in shape and emerald green in color.  It moved roughly 30 degrees across the sky in a fraction of a second before slowing down and almost stopping.   A few seconds later it increased in apparent magnitude and continued East at the same quick speed as before until it was out of site.
