The weatherman said the Geminid meteor shower was occuring that night, recommending the best time to view the event was before midnight.  I went outside and looked up towards the E/SE sky.  It was a clear, crisp night, allowing the constellation Orion to easily catch my eye off to the right of my peripheral vision.  After only a few moments of star gazing in that same direction, 5-6 reddish-orange/burnt orange lights appeared out of nowhere just above the few tall pine trees that border that side of the property.  These lights shined as if they were large, bright stars, and appeared in a straight line with equal distances between each (• • • • •).  I believe these lights to have been the tail side of the object, possibly part of a propulsion system. It sat in a completely still hover for only a couple of seconds and then quickly accelerated without a sound toward the E/SE, tilting as it appeared to turn slightly more south and gain in altitude till out of sight.  It was quite an experience and I began questioning whether or not I had just seen what I thought I'd seen.  In the next ten minutes or so, I also got to enjoy more than a dozen meteors as well.  I did a quick glance on nuforc.org and found the following entry that is very similar to mine.   	Occurred : 12/2/2006 18:20 (Entered as : 12/2/06 18:20) 	Reported: 12/2/2006 7:38:20 PM 19:38 	Posted: 12/7/2006 	Location: West Dundee, IL 	Shape: Formation 	Duration:30-40 seconds 	String of 6-7 lights equally spaced apart, about 1000 ft up 	  moving quietly West to East in the night sky.  	I was walking in my back yard, letting my dog out and getting 	  some firewood. I looked up to see how the stars looked on this 	cool  crisp night when I noticed what appeared to be a flock of 	lit  birds...but turned out to be a string of lights, 	approximately  1/3 high up in the sky. If I had to guess less 	than 1,000 ft up.  	My dog began barking but other than that the sky was dead 	  quiet. The 6 lit objects almost looked like stars but were a 		  dull orange or pink tone and moved in perfect unison. This 	could  have been one object. The object moved from West to East 	at a  slow but steady pace.  	I have tried to think about all possible alternatives and 	  ratonalizing this but cannot determine what this is. It 	  definitely was not a natural occurrance and has shaken me.;40.6189367346939;-79.1580693877552
