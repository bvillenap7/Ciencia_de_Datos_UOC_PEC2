cone  - orange  ball on top orange cone then changing to yellow with yellow ball on bottom;1975-07-22 02:00:00;3-4 hr;cone  - orange  ball on top orange cone then changing to yellow with yellow ball on bottom I was working 23:00 till 07:00 outside on a gas drilling rig as the driller [ we just moved the rig in that day ]  when about 02:00 i saw a orange ball appear in the sky and it got darker orange as time went on . Then a cone started down from it that was orange and turned to yellow thats when i called the other guys i was working with to look at this . These guys watched for a little while then ran back in the dog house[ tool shed ] they were afraid of it . I finally got them back out and we watched the cone come down and a smaller yellow ball appeared at the bottom about 1/2 the size of the orange ball. By this time it was starting to get light out and the lighter it got the more transparent the ufo got till it was completly daylight and you couldent see it but it was still there . The state police were called to this area because of lights flying around they acknowledge seeing lights but couldent explain them i read that in the paper six mounths earlier . It all happened about 25 yrs ago and lasted about 3-4 hrs it was big !!! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.6189367346939;-79.1580693877552
