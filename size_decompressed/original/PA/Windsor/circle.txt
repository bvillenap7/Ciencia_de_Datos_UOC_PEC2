Red fireball lights.;2017-09-28 20:00:00;5 minutes;Red fireball lights Two red glowing balls of light were traveling one behind the other right over a local annual event.  The ball of light in back increased speed and passed the other than traveled in a downward motion and faded.   The other continued to travel straight but faded away a few seconds after the other.   I don't know if anyone attending the event saw them, as a band was playing, however I was across the street and saw them clearly for approximately five minutes.;39.9267;-76.5563
