As I was pouring morning coffee, I looked out the north side window to see a brilliant apple green comet/teardrop shaped object zoom west to north on a slight curvature appearing to head for the ground.   The body of the comet or the teardrop on its side was a darker green and the tail appeared as a lighter apple green.;40.1586;-75.282
