Small bright, fast object.;2014-04-15 23:00:00;1 minutes;small bright,fast object I was sitting with my husband on our deck.  Husband was facing me and I was looking to the southern sky.  I saw a small lighted object high in the sky moving at a rapid speed.   It stopped suddenly on a dime shot straight up did a corkscrew type turn and disappeared.   It was something I've never seen before.  I didn't even tell my husband because he would think I was crazy.  This is the first time I've told anyone.  I believe it was in April of 2014.   This experience was just unexplainable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));40.1586;-75.282
