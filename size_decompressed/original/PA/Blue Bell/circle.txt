Say the area of sky is the size of my computer screen and imagine the thing to be the size of a dime. Seeing it in the sky it appeared the size of a melon...but who knows because how far away was it? Anyhow it had a pale green glow and was trailed by a long tail of a similar paler glow.It made no sound. I said Look! Did you see that? As you can see, it happened so fast that my sentence changed tenses. My husband didn't see it. After we got home I called our friends who had gone to their car in another part of the lot. They didn't see it either. So then I called the Blue Bell (Whitpain) police to see if anyone else reported anything. They said nobody had. Today I got the bright idea to do a search on the letters UFO. Here I am.;40.1586;-75.282
