Bright, randomly flashing, zig-zagging craft or object (possibly orb) off in the distance.;2004-12-16 04:30:00;10 minutes;Bright, randomly flashing, zig-zagging craft or object (possibly orb) off in the distance. I heard a deep, low-pitch flight noise which motivated me to wonder what the heck it was.  Upon looking out my window to the west, I saw a bright randomly flashing object that was moving jaggedly about in a southward direction.  I have never seen flight like this.  In reality, looking at least 10 miles to the west, I don't think what I heard (the low-pitch) was what I saw.  However, this thing flew like an insect on speed.  It bobbed and weaved about, extremely rapidly, within a small radius, while travelling wherever it was headed.  I am a logical person, and the fact that the flashes were extremely bright for how far it seemed away and totally random (not timed like a commercial plane light), plus the fact that it was rapidly darting about (again constantly darting within a small area of space- the movement was part of this thing's flight pattern) leads me to believe it was not from this world, at least to my knowledge.  I've heard of hovering, and rapid speeds, but this things was rapid within a short space of area, not darting expansive distances.  It was beyond weird, and I would've woken my family had it not been 4:30 in the morning.  Also, in a big city like Philadelphia (I live in the suburbs 10 miles away), you'd have to expect these things would not want to be seen, hence, they would probably only show themselves at very stategically planned times- such as 4:30 when most people are asleep, or not yet awoken.  I know what I saw, I may've been tired, but I know what I saw.  And what I saw cannot be defined as a space craft from this world, at least to the layperson's knowledge.  This was energy, raw energy I presume from the random flashes and hectic darting pattern.  This thing was out of this world, I am pretty sure of that.;40.0022;-75.3008
