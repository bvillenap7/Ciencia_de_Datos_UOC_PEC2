Huge orange flash of light from satellite going over.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from an Iridium satellite?  PD));2019-02-04 18:30:00;15 seconds;Huge orange flash of light from satellite going over . Went out on the back porch at around 6:30 pm, and looked up to a clear sky.  I saw what looked to be a satellite going over and then a huge flash from it.  I think it could have been an explosion with an orange color of light.   At first i thought it was a reflection from the sun, but it was too big for that at that far up.  The satellite continued across the sky and out of sight.;40.8885;-78.2227
