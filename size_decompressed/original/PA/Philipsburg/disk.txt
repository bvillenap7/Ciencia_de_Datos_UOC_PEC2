She woke me to look out our window (south) I then saw two craft with red lights flying and hovering.  For the next couple of hours we watched numerous red, green, and bright red with blinding strobe fly in all directions at varying speeds.  These were not jets!  They flew next to each other one minute then would fly in opposite directons and then disappear and return in a completly different direction. Bizzare to say the least. ((NUFORC:  From our experience, it is unusual for genuine UFO's to remain in one general area for this length of time.));40.8885;-78.2227
