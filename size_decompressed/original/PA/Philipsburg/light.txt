Noted star like object moving in relation to a telephone pole.;2008-06-20 22:20:00;5 minutes;Noted star like object moving in relation to a telephone pole.  It was moving in a westerly direction. There is no way to note speed as I have no way to know the distance of the object.  60 or so seconds after I first saw the object, I noted the strobing light of an aircraft approximately following the path of the UFO.;40.8885;-78.2227
Lights appearing abnormally in the night sky;2008-10-30 23:15:00;2 minutes?;Lights appearing abnormally in the night sky I was a passenger in our family car. My wife and I were driving to work on route 322 east toward State College, PA. It was a very clear night sky and objects were easily visible. I glanced out the passenger side window and saw what at first I took to be airplane lights. I then noted the lights were not moving slowly as one would expect, but appeared stationary. I only saw a light or tiny group of lights, no form or shape. It is possible that it might have been a helicopter, but I doubt it from the location and length of time it remained stationary. I had the object(s) within view about two minutes. Because we were on the way to work, I could not pull off and view the display for a lengthly period of time.;40.8885;-78.2227
