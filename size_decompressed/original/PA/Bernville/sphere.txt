Orange sphere traveling through Berks County, PA.;2014-07-19 22:07:00;20 seconds;Orange sphere traveling through Berks County PA Four of us were relaxing on the patio when one person said, “Is that a fireball?”   Everyone looked through the trees (to the south) to see an orange object in the sky, and at first we all thought it was a fireball.  However, this object was moving much more slowly than any fireball we’ve ever seen.  It was travelling towards the northwest. Everyone left their seats and moved to an area where it would be easier to see, and I was able to get some video with my cell phone camera.  This object was moving about as fast as most aircraft, but it didn’t have the blinking lights that we always see on planes and helicopters just a very orange glow that kept getting bigger, then smaller, over and over.  We heard no noise coming from the object. Eventually the object moved out of our range of vision, and that was the end of the event for us.;40.4145;-76.0923
