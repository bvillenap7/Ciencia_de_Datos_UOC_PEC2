Very bright cigar shape craft seen in berks county at 5am;2015-11-30 05:00:00;1 minute;Very bright cigar shape craft seen in berks county at 5am 1st day of hunting season here in PA.  Was putting my boat into a local lake (bluemarsh) at 5am to head to my spot.  I seen I very bright light off to the west, little higher then tree top level.  Figured a incoming plane.  It hovered for a bit, and the started coming towards me. No sound, at all!  As it got closer, i realized this was not any plane or helicopter.  It got almost above me, and I could clearly see a cigar shape in the light. I could also see as it looked like, windows on the craft.  It was very bright, and didnt know what to do. I had a flash light in my hand, and turned it on, and as soon as I flashed my light on it...  POOF, it was instantly gone!!!! No sight of it anywhere.  It just disappeared.....  Never seen anything like it before....  It was 1st day of hunting so im sure many others witnessed this.... Just couldn't make out the craft untill it got close enough.... it was close enough.... too close... Not a drone, no way... too big, too bright, no sound.;40.4145;-76.0923
