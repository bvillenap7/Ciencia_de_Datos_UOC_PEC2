Sighted two orange rectangles above treetops while driving on a county road.;1996-07-05 22:00:00;2 min.;Sighted two orange rectangles above treetops while driving on a county road. While a passenger in a vehicle being driven by a friend, we were driving on a country road in a wooded area after dark.  We first saw a stationary orange rectangle on a ridge line about a quarter mile away.  As we drove along the base of the ridge about 20 seconds later we noticed an orange reflection in the windshield, and at that point I rolled down the window and stuck my head out the door to look straight up.  What  I saw at that point was a pair of rectangular orange panels moving in sync directly above our vehicle, just above the treetops, mirroring our path along the winding road.  This conitnued for about two miles.  The objects made no noise, and there was no wash of air hitting us from above.  I believe the panels were part of one object, located at the rear of it.  I kept my eyes fixed on it the entire time and when we came to a stop sign I jumped out of the vehicle and it shot straight away from us, slightly gaining altitude, but made no noise.  It did not disappear over a horizon line, but disappeared from view in the distance in less than two seconds.  I estimate each orange rectangle to have been about 15 by 20 feet and about 20 feet apart, with the outer edges angled slightly forward.
