((anon.);2019-09-27 20:45:00;1 minute;I was watching for satellites when I saw 3 in a triangle formation.  Moving in the fashion of a satellite with no blinking light and in high orbit.  All moving at the same speed but in a triangle formation.  Whatever it was it was not a solid formation we could see stars between the formation.  It did not block out light from other stars. it could have been satellites all in Orbit together flying in a v but I highly doubt that.;40.4853;-77.1656
