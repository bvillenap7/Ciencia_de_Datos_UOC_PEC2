J shape by Moon;2003-11-08 20:05:00;moments;J shape by Moon Mr. Davenport, I had gone out into the yard to let my dogs in and while I was there I realised that the eclipse was happening. I looked up at it only momentarily as I have heard of the possibility of eye damage . To the right of the moon at 2 o'clock to 4'oclock position I saw stars? lights? I don't know, but in a J position. I only am reporting this as I heard you on the Coast to Coast program (taped broadcast Streamlink Sun 11/16/03) When someone on the show mentioned the J shape, that triggered my memory. I'm sorry that I can be of no further information but as I stated I didn't look at it all that long. If I may be of any future service to you in verification or even legwork in the Western Pa. or Eastern Ohio area, please don't hesitate to call on me. Thank You, Michael Bland 724-251-9167;40.557;-80.1578
