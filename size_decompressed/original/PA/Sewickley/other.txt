The sun was still up so it was strange to see the bright, planet-like object.  I inspected it with binoculars and it seemed to have two smal moons, much like what Jupiter looks like through binoculars.  I called to my wife and 16 year old stepson who also saw the object that remained stationary..  My stepson used an astronomy app and told me that it was not Jupiter.  His app showed Jupiter in the southwestern sky.  Once the sun went down the object completely disappeared.;40.557;-80.1578
