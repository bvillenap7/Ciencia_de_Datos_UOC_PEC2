Orange fireball traveling across sky;2012-07-21 21:50:00;3 minutes;Orange fireball traveling across sky I went outside of my home to get something from my car, and looked up to see a bright orange light like a fireball traveling from east to west in the sky.  I ran back to the house to call for my wife and kids to come out to see it.  It appeared from over a line of trees, moved silently and steadily, and continued for a couple of minutes in a straight line until it completely disappeared in the distance.  We weren't able to determine its size because there was no point of reference, but if you held a quarter up at arm's length it would have just covered it.   We then went back in the garage for a minute, but came back out and saw the same thing just hovering in the sky over the house this time, not moving at all for about 30 seconds.  Then this one moved off into the distance and disappeared like the first one.  We don't know if this one was the same object that we saw the first time and had returned, or if it was a separate one.  Strangest thing we've ever seen, and have no idea what this could have been.;40.557;-80.1578
