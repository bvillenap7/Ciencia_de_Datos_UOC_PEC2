At or around 21:50 EST, we saw 3 orange colored lights in an inverted pyramid shape.  It was located to the left of the big dipper.  It appeared to be moving slowly towards our direction.  About 20 seconds later the bottom right light flickered out.  Then about 20 seconds after that the bottom left did the same thing.  Then, the very top one flickered out, came back on slightly then disappeared completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
