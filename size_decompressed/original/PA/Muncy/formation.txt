Formation of 8-10? star-like lights, equal distance apart, quietly gliding across sky from SW to NE  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-20 21:00:00;2-3 minutes?;Formation of 8-10? star-like lights, equal distance apart, quietly gliding across sky from SW to NE direction, 2-3 minutes, 9 pm. On April 20, 2020, at 2100 hours (9:00 pm), a clear night, in backyard in quiet town, my husband and I noticed a formation of star-like lights in the sky, like a dipper, but as we were looking at this stretch of lights across the sky, we noticed there was no dipper - just a long handle - and each star-like light appeared to be of equal distance from the other, and they were gliding, quietly, in a SW to NE direction.  By the time we noticed this, there were 8-10 of the lights.  There may have been more already gone by and this could have been the tail end.  It lasted less than 2-3 minutes.  By the time I ran in and got my camera, they were all gone over. We would like to know, at least, if this was something of known origin and planned like drones/airplanes/Airforce related or actual unidentified. Thank you.  Feel free to contact.;41.2137;-76.7633
