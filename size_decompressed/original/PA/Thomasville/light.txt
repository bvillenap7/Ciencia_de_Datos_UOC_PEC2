Two helicopters chasing red orbs.;2015-08-11 22:00:00;5 minutes;Two Helicopters Chasing Red Orbs. I witnessed two helicopters flying in an erratic fashion, stopping, changing direction frequently.  From a distance, I could see that there were additional steady illuminated red lights that could not belong to the helicopters.   The two helicopters seemed to be travelling too close to one another and had their searchlights on, which seemed odd so I continued to observe.  When they flew above me, (approx 200-250 ft) I saw that the searchlights were spotted on the red lights and the red lights did not attach to any aircraft.   I witnessed two helicopters, each chasing a red orb.  The orbs sped off due east and the helicopters followed.  I attempted to continue my observance by vehicle but could not keep up.;39.9324;-76.886
