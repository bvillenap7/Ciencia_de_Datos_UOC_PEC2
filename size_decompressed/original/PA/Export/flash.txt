Irregular star like flashes;2020-02-14 20:30:00;5 minutes;Irregular star like flashes Between the constellations of Gemini and Orion I saw, out of the corner of my eye, what appeared to be a light flash from a high flying aircraft. I focused my gaze in that area, expecting to see it again since aircraft flash at a regular rate. There was no flash. I resumed scanning the sky again and saw another flash in the earlier position.  It was about 8 seconds between these flashes. I waited 15 seconds and nothing happened again. About 10 seconds after that, I saw a third flash in the same area as before, so I focused on it again.  This time I was privileged to get a series of six flashes.  They were not evenly spaced in the 90 seconds I saw them. At NO time did it move.  The flashes were between two stars, and it maintained the same distance between them all the while I observed this. At first I thought it was a rotating satellite, but it did not move. I am at a loss to explain this.;40.4252;-79.6091
