Bright white light heading South East across the sky near Export, Pa.;2013-08-05 05:11:00;2 minutes;Bright white light heading South East across the sky near Export, Pa. As I was leaving my house at approximately 5:11am I was facing South and across the road up the hill above the tree line I saw a light heading East/South East across the sky.  It was a bright white object moving at aircraft speed.  I ruled out aircraft neither because I saw no strobe lights nor could I hear any sound.  I tried taking photos with my phone but the image didn't come out at all.  After I got into my car I headed up the road on my way to work I could see it disappearing over the horizon down the road ahead of me across the intersection.  If I wasnâ€™t late for work I would have followed it.   I am an artist/illustrator small business owner as my profession and an avid sky watcher. I could be mistaken but I am confident that it was something other than a plane or helicopter.;40.4252;-79.6091
