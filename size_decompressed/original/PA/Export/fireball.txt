Blue/Green Round Object with Tail sighted moving South-SouthWest;2002-08-10 04:35:00;10 seconds;Blue/Green Round Object with Tail sighted moving South-SouthWest I viewed a strange object while driving my car on Harrison City Road at @4:35 am near Export Pennsylvania Saturday August 10th. It was a bright blue-green ball with a short tail travelling faster than a plane, but not as fast as a shooting star that I saw at approximately 10:30 pm Friday eve, probably from the perseid meteor shower. It's size was disturbing, about 1/3 size of the moon at approximately 25-30 degrees above the horizon travelling away from me on the path shown below. The distance of the object from my car, may have been, much greater than the map shown below. The object did not make any turns, but followed a straight path.
