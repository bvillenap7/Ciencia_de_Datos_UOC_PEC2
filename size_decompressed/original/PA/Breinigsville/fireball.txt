Fireball Sighting;2007-12-14 22:34:00;5 seconds;Fireball Sighting Viewed a very bright and extremely fast greenish yellow object for about 5 seconds in the western sky.  It seemed to be really close and it appeared at low altitude and had what resembled to be a short tail. It resembled a meteorite, but the colors were striking.  I also noted that it traveled downward at a fairly steep angle which also seemed unusual.  It then disappeared after a few seconds when it seemed to be getting very close to the ground.;40.5538;-75.6514
