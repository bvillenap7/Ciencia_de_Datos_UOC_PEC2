alien abduction;2000-11-20 04:13:00;not sure;alien abduction I didn't actually see the UFO, but I'm sure what happened wasn't a dream.  I saw one when I was little, so I know theyr'e out there.  I woke up at exactly 4:13 in the morning, crying.  I was in this room sort of like a warehouse.  I saw windows on the left side of it.  I can't remember actually seeing any beings, but they had my 18 year old son on a table tied to it.  There was another person on a table to the right of him.  They told me they were going to cut him up and eat him.  I found out after telling my daughter about the dream I had that my son had a weird experience too.  He had missing time of about an hour.  He said he was driving early in the morning to meet his Dad for a hunting trip, and he was at the top of a mountain the last he remembered.  He can't remember getting to the bottom.  Later that night his friends noticed three strange marks on his upper arm.  I've been doing a lot of reading since and one of the books explains about the grays doing emotional testing.  I really think that's what happened to us.  I have the feeling that I've been experiwenceing abductions since I was four years old, when I first saw the big white ball of light in the field across from my house.  I truly felt like my son was in danger.  I was trying to stop them from eating him, and protect him.  It's the only dream that I can remember that vividly.  Thanks for any input you can give me.;40.5538;-75.6514
