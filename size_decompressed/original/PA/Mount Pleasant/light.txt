Flashing red, blue, and green, swiftly moving neon light over Pennsylvania;2010-03-30 23:00:00;1 hour;Flashing red, blue, and green, swiftly moving neon light over Pennsylvania At 11 PM on March 30th, 2010 a bright light appeared in the sky just to the left of the little dipper.  My husband and I witnessed it changing colors and flashing bright neon orange, pink, and green.  Several times a red flashing dot flew off to the side of it and then back to the main light again.  At 11:30 two other flashing dots appeared but disappeared shortly after.  The first dot remained in the sky for over an hour and continuously moved up and down and side to side at a very fast speed.  When it began to move I called my mother, my brother, my sister in law and brother in law, all of whom were able to see it as all even though they were over 40 miles away.  While talking on the phone we were able to observe it moving at the same time in the same direction.  Throughout the duration that it was viable it continued to flash very brightly in red, blue and green.;40.1742;-79.5134
