Possible Central Pennsylvania Sighting ~09.25.01;2001-09-25 14:00:00;atleast 5 min.;Possible Central Pennsylvania Sighting ~09.25.01 might have been 2 baloons (not passenger baloons, hand-held circus-type baloons), not sure. at about 2:00 pm est. I was in the north wing (radiology dept.) at Sunbury community hospital (Snyder county (central) Pennsylvania) where I work. I am an avid skyfisher with my camcorder and enjoy sky watching. I was looking (as i do throughout the day) for odd/chemtrail activity but instead saw two unusual objects. The more stationary of the two was larger and seemed  to exhibit no anomalous motion. approximate range seemed to be about at least 2-4 miles. Clear blue skys (for once ). The smaller object appeared to be moving southeast at about double the speed of the first. The larger object appeard brighter than the smaller, mobile object. My impression was that of two mylar ballons catching the sun, but why at that range would one move consistantly away from the other at twice the speed, while the other remained relatively motionless? Since it's been 19 years since i last saw a UFO i called two associates who saw the same thing. Since one is a smoker and was going out for a smoke break i asked her to look for them from outside, to no avail. She later asked me about the objects she had seen from inside but not outside, I had no aditional info. thus no response. ANYWAY......... Hope to correlate potential sighting with other PA skywatchers during this time.  Somewhat skeptical of actual saucer since no overt contraindiction of modern Physics was observed. Peace!
