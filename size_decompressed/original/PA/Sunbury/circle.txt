25 solid circular lights moving SE in a strait line.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 21:06:00;90 seconds;25 solid circular lights moving SE in a strait line My spouse was outside at approximately 21:00 and happened to look up and saw what resembled the constellation Orion, but she realized they were moving.  We yelled to our 23 year old son who is a US Army veteran to come look at what we were seeing and as I looked in the opposite direction in the sky, I observed over twenty additional lights, all moving SE in a strait line, no noise, equally spaced, no pulsing lights and traversed the area of sky in 90 seconds.;40.8541;-76.7909
