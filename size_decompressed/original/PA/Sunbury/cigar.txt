Whilst at work last Friday, I was looking to the west when I saw a white cylinder shape moving in and out of the clouds.  My first impression that it was just a plane flying at high altitude.  It then stopped hovered for about few minutes moving up and down, at one point it seem to shimmy or change shape but not any larger.  It then moved up at 45: angle and disappeared.  I do not have any footage as at first it did not seem strange only when moved upward and disappeared that I realized it may have been a UFO.  If it is a government experimental craft it very sophisticated.;40.8541;-76.7909
