Green Fireball Sighted Over Franklin County PA;2010-06-24 22:05:00;2 to 3 seconds;Green Fireball Sighted Over Franklin County PA Approximately 10:05 (+/- 10 minutes) PM EST, I was outside when I saw what appeared to be a single firework streaking downward.  It had different colors, but the most noticeable was green.  If it would have been a firework, I would have judged it to be set off about half a mile away, but I never actually saw any upward trajectory, and there was absolutely no sound to it.   We have had fireworks set off about a mile from our house on holidays, and we can definitely hear them in our rural area.  I stayed outside approximately 5 to 10 minutes, and never heard a sound other than a passenger jet high above. The object was North of me, travelling in a roughly 45 degree angle, appearing to travel from East to West.  It traveled about the same speed as meteors I have seen before, and before it disappeared in the air, it seemed to have a great green flash, with possibly some orange and white.   If I stretched my arms out in front of me, using my hands to determine when it started and appeared to end, I would say the entire event took place within 3 feet, and the final burst or flash appeared about the size of my fist (approx 3 inch diameter), with the core being about the size of a silver dollar.;39.9547;-77.8984
