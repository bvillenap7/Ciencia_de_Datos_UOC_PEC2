Floating saucer over Mononongahela Valley Country Club in Monongahela, Pa.;2009-05-01 16:00:00;~5 minutes;Floating saucer over Mononongahela Valley Country Club in Monongahela, Pa. As a friend and I were driving on Route 88 in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, I spotted what at first I thought was a helicopter in the distance over Monongahela Valley Country Club. I continued driving while my eyes were glued to this object. I noticed the object was not moving at all. This was when I realized that this object was NOT a helicopter. I became startled, turned down the radio, and forcefully tapped my friend on the shoulder to get his attention. His first words were What the hell is that?  Unlike me, he instantly came to the conclusion that this object was not a helicopter. I was still driving when I noticed the break in the trees was beginning to close. I pulled over on to country club road and parked my car. Because we were playing an assassin game, I had binoculars in my car. We then ran out onto the golf course. The object was still hovering in place approximately 1-1 1/2 miles away. I put the binoculars up to my eyes and gazed at this disc-shaped object. It was a UFO. The typical UFO every person imagines in their head. As I was staring at it, it moved slowly to the right behind another set of trees upon a hill. My friend and I ran back to the car and drove into the cemetery where the patch of trees were. When we got to the top of the hill, into a total clearing above the city and everything in the area, it was gone. Completely gone, out of site. I am posting this hoping that somebody else in the Monongahela area will see this and confirm that they saw the same thing.
