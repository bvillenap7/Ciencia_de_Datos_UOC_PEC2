Three reddish orange crafts hovering in the form of a perfect right triangle.;2015-09-05 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;Three reddish orange crafts hovering in the form of a perfect right triangle. I was coming home from work up a steep hill, and at the crest of the hill, I noticed three bright reddish orange circular crafts hovering off the in distance in the shape of a perfect right triangle.  Immediately, I thought of it being UFOs, with no hesitation I told my mother, with whom I was on the phone, just that.   After making a turn in a new direction, I could still see them through the trees, and I could still see them hovering at the crest of the next hill.  They weren't obscenely bright, but they weren't moving, and there were no stars visible at all. I lost sight of them when I reached home.;40.1937;-79.9241
