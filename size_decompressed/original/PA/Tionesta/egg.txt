This is nothing like I have ever seen.;2010-10-29 19:45:00;Present;This is nothing like I have ever seen. At first I thought it was a star, then noticed the red blinking lights around the regular light (looks like a star) - called 2nd witness out to look at it. 3rd witness came out a few seconds after.   Second witness went in the house, right after she went in the house another set of lights started coming across the sky (thought it was an airplane because of the pattern) the lights I thought were a star darted tword the second set of lights, went around it in a circle and then proceeded to where it was!   The lights I thought were a plane then changed direction (fast, not like an airplane) and proceeded to the spot the first set of lights were, the original lights left really fast, and the second set STAYED in the same spot like a star.... 4-5 planes flew by the hovering lights and have not returned.  I am pretty sure they were regular planes because they stayed straight, and I could hear the engines...  This is still going on right now... I have not seen the planes! return, and the strange lights are still hanging out in the same spot, and keeps moving around in the same area in all different directions...;41.5145;-79.3631
