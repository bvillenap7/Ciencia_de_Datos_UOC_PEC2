From that same area smaller whites numbering 12 one right after another appeared.   ((Starlink satellites??));1983-07-23 20:10:00;10 minutes;A stationary single bright light southwest of Bedford, Pa. From that same area smaller whites numbering 12 one right after another appeared to travel in a straight line away from the single bright stationary one. At certain times one of the ones smaller ones would become brighter or surge in brightness and appear to grow in size. I am not sure if they were circling around the stationary bright one or they were individuallly moving away but they all appeared to be equi-distance away from one another.;39.9921;-78.5216999999999
