I saw a circular object appear in the sky.  It had green flashing lights, about six or seven.  I couldn't make out the color of the object itself because it was so dark out.  At first I thought it was an airplane until I realized how low it was flying and how fast it disappeared.;39.8340140625;-77.2172921875001
Regularly noted (over at least the past year), unknown bright white objects in night sky,  aligned.((Spacelink satellites??));2019-12-29 00:30:00;Hours;Regularly noted (over at least the past year), unknown bright white objects in night sky, which seem to be geometrically aligned. Three bright white circular objects that appeared to be stationary.  Sometimes I have seen flashing (?rotating?) blue and red lights, or bright circular white flashing lights. No green lights noted.  No sound heard. Hard to tell height from ground, but they are high in the sky. Seem to be at 60-90 degree compass points from each other.  I have seen very fast flying objects at different times as well.  I typically stay up late in the night, and have seen these objects regularly over the past year (when sky is clear).  Times vary but from 2100-0200 hours on various nights. Am not sure whether they are present (but not visible) during daylight hours.  Multiple neighbors have also seen them. Reported to local police some time ago.  My father was a pilot and I grew up flying and watching the sky. These objects are unlike anything I have ever seen before.  They capture my attention because I can’t figure out what they are...I thought they might be military-related due to our location and close proximity to secure government sites.  Now I am reporting to you, since there is news of “drone sightings” in other states.  Pictures taken from cell phone showed tiny object in vast night sky.  Did not seem to represent scale of what I am seeing with my naked eye.;39.8340140625;-77.2172921875001
