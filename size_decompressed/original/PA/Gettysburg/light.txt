Multiple times from 80's to 90's, I saw light at night over Gettysburg battlefield, made no sound moved like helicopter.;1985-01-30 21:00:00;30 minutes;Multiple times from 80's to 90's I saw light at night over Gettysburg battlefield, made no sound moved like helicopter. Quite often in 1980's to mid 90s I believe primarily during the winter time January, February (after Christmas) I would see a light, that looked kinda like a star (but not twinkling) and moved like a helicopter--odd directions, but was completely silent.  This kind of thing would happen whenever I was in the Gettysburg battlefield at night looking toward the west.  I don't really know how high this object was flying--I'd see it multiple times in multiple winters (?).  Never said a word to anyone--I maybe was afraid for some weird reason?!?  That's it/all--that's my story, thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));39.8340140625;-77.2172921875001
it appeared to be a eraticlly moving star moving a foot in any and all directions at incredible speeds;2002-06-01 22:00:00;1 hour;it appeared to be a eraticlly moving star moving a foot in any and all directions at incredible speeds objects appeared to be stars, and the only reason i noticed them is because i was lying in a field on a blanket on a battle field just up the hill from gettysburg college the one w/ the big metal tower look-out it looked like a moving star moving at first in a straight line several inches ( if you would hold a 12 ruler at arms length) and then stop then it would stop, then it accelerated foreward 3 or 4 times in short bursts then in a zig-zag pattern,at incredible speeds my girlfriend also saw it but not wanting to believe that it might be a ufo could not give an explanation for the kind of movements it was making. she is a 3rd yr med student in pittsburgh an alumni of gettysburg college and i am an electrician i am from the pittsburg area, and yes both  of us were sober;39.8340140625;-77.2172921875001
UFO sighting on a Ghost tour in Gettysburg.;2003-11-21 22:30:00;2 hours;UFO sighting on a Ghost tour in Gettysburg. My friends and I were on a ghost tour in Gettysburg PA.  What we saw was a light in the sky right below the constellation Orion.  It was larger than a star and was blinking red, blue, green, and white.  It was not moving so it was not an airplane and it was to high up to be a tower of any sort.  The night was calm and clear.  There were 5 witnesses including myself (3 friends and the tour guide), all of whom saw exactly what I described.  We continued to see this light the entire way back to school from the tour. ((NUFORC Note:  A very good description of the star, Sirius.  It twinkles vividly.  PD));39.8340140625;-77.2172921875001
Bright White Light at Night;2008-09-28 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;Bright White Light at Night Looked up and saw unusually bright white light. It was much brighter than all other stars, etc. At first, I had the unusual sensation that all the stars were moving while this object remained still. It was as bright as a car headlight in the sky, but not clear light, simply white. I always look for flashing lights, and this had none. Also,no noise. Dead silent. It moved fairly slowly to the north for about a minute or so, seemingly getting farther away (as if gaining altitude). All of a sudden it dimmed to the point that I could only locate it with my peripheral vision. It stayed on it's path, but was barely visible. After another few seconds, I lost it in the very clear night sky. My thought is that before I noticed it, it must have been lower and directly over my house. Scary. This is the second possible sighting of my life, with about 18 years in between. The older was was a way different scenario, and an apprently different type of craft. I'm very open-minded, but not stupidly so. There may some explanation for what I saw, but it could have been otherwordly as well. Just kinda weird.;39.8340140625;-77.2172921875001
