Loud noise with line of changing colors and disappearing!;2010-05-15 21:00:00;30 seconds;Loud noise with line of changing colors and disappearing! My friend and I were walking back to my house when we heard a loud noise like a firework or a bomb going off.  After the noise there was an object that appeared as close as the utility pole!  It was a line of light changing colors such as blue,purple,green,yellow,orange,and red. It was magnificent for 30 seconds and then it was gone.  It appeared out of thin air and then it disappeared.   Has anyone else experienced anything like this? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.8340140625;-77.2172921875001
