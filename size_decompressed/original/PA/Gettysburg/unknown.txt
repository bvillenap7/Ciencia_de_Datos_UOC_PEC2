I looked out of my hotel window for no given reason.  There was a bright red-orange-yellow sphere in the sky. I woke up at 10:50.  I was very restless and I got out of bed to get a drink of water.  After a quick bathroom break I walked over to the hotel window, and pulled the curtain aside.  Nothing was normal at first to me.  I remember noticing the object in the sky and quickly passing it off for a plane or something else.  After a while it dawned on me that the object in the sky was not moving and was a very unnatural color which kept changing from red to yellow to orange and back to red again.  I could not tell what the shape of the craft was because of the lights which were growing and shrinking in size.  I stared at this figure in the sky for a long time.  Suddenly, the light dissapeared completely from sight, leaving no trace of its existance.  When I looked at the clock again it was 11:12.  The strangest part of this experience was that when I stepped back into bed, even though I had just experienced a strange and even scarry sight, I felt very relaxed and happy, and fell back to sleep easily.;39.8340140625;-77.2172921875001
