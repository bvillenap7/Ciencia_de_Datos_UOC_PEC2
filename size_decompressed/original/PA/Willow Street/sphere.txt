10 bright lights moving in formation through Lancaster County, Pa.;2014-07-19 20:30:00;20 minutes;10 bright lights moving in formation through Lancaster County Pa. July 19, 2014, 10 bright lights moving in formation through Lancaster County. Around 8:30 pm Saturday night these lights caught our attention moving just above the horizon looking northeast towards Gap, Pa from Willow Street, Pa.  We first thought they were some type of military exercise since they started out flying in formation side by side. We first counted 3 distinct lights that were a Yellow/white in color moving in formation in a southwestern direction.  Three of them moved into a triangle formation.  Next to the triangle at this time 7 more lights appeared in groups of twos and threes and created a formation of 7 side by side. In the foreground, a plane flew by in front of these lights with a distinct flashing red light. You could distinctly tell these lights were not planes. The lights one by one began move upward and seemed to disappear one at a time, like when a plane flies into a cloud. My wife and I observed the lights for about twenty minutes before they disappeared. The perspective of how big or far away they were was difficult to judge because it was dark and beginning to get cloudy.  From their distance we could not hear any sounds coming from them.;39.9655;-76.2809
Anyone see strange orange lights over Willow Street Pa 9/27/14 ?;2014-09-27 20:15:00;3 minutes;Anyone see strange orange lights over Willow Street Pa 9/27/14 ? My son was out on the back deck when he called me out to see something strange in the sky.  What we saw was 6 orange lights in the northern part of the sky.  These objects moved slowly toward the east.  As we observed them a 7th light appeared from the south moving north an hovering just above us.  This light changed color from reds to orange, and both at once. It appeared to be watching the other lights.  As the other lights moved eastward and became obscured by a tree line, the 7th seemed to slowly fade out.  This hovering light was different from the rest it was more like an oval then a sphere.  All said and done we witnessed this event for 4-5 min.  Bazzar!;39.9655;-76.2809
