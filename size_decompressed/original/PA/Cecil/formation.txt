I saw what I thought it was a formation of military helicopters flying single file just past the National Cemetery of the Alleghenies - I would estimate the height to be 3 to 5 thousand feet.  They looked to be bright orange lights which I thought strange.  What was even stranger, as I was driving I noticed I was gaining on them.   When I was almost underneath them I opened my sunroof to hear the rotors.  I heard nothing and pulled to the side of the road to see what they were.  I was stunned and when I finally had the sense to video them on my cell phone the formation had broken with the lead craft pulling to the side causing the formation to look like a right angle.  The lead craft then shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  The next in line did the same.   The last two headed towards each other and did what almost looked like a dance with quick and seemingly choreographed movement before they both disappeared from view.  I have good video of this on my phone.  Again they never made a sound.   Still cannot believe what I saw.;40.3262;-80.1841
