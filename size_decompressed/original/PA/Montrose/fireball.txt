Bright circle of red / orange light seemed to circle the house.;2010-07-04 22:00:00;20 minutes;Bright circle of red / orange light seemed to circle the house. After watching fireworks, I continued to look up at the night sky.  I saw a huge circle of red / orangish light at a distance moving toward the house.  It was small at this time.  We then went around the house to sit and talk on the patio.  Then a friend said to look up to the sky and see the large bright light.  It was the same ball of light only much larger and closer now.  I continued to watch it as it got smaller and then suddenly disappeared from the night sky.  It was silent, not a helicopter or a plane.  No blinling lights and no noise.  It  had flown on somekind of path around the house....seeming to circle the house but could not tell the distance.
