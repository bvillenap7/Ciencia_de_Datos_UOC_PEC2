Silver helicopter-looking craft moved vertically from still position.;2008-09-03 18:30:00;> 15 seconds;Silver helicopter-looking craft moved vertically from still position. My husband and I were eating dinner when I saw a movement from the corner of my eye.  Our house is at the bottom of a steep field, and perhaps 100 yards from our kitchen was what looked like a silver helicopter on the ground at the treeline.  Almost as soon as I had seen it, it lifted straight up from the ground, moved horizontally toward the house for maybe 2 seconds, and then shot vertically into the air.  It was only then that it made a very slight humming noise, but until that point, it was completely silent.  My husband ran from the kitchen to our back porch (about eight feet), but by the time he got outside, the aircraft was completely out of sight.  He did notice that our German Shepherd was looking up in the direction we had seen it move.  I did not see anyone in control of the craft, but it was roughly the same size and appearance as a helicopter.  I don't see how it was a helicopter, though for it to have been so close to the house and on the ground, it would have been deafeningly loud.
