Bright white light that changed color and moved;2002-08-30 00:45:00;several mins.;Bright white light that changed color and moved The night of Aug. 29-30 I wasn't able to sleep so I was up watching TV. It was  around 12:45am early Friday morning. I had to go to the bathroom and decided to look out the window , which was right across the entrance to my bathroom. I notice this BIG bright white light in the distance, towards the Northeast direction. As I looked at it, I noticed it changed from white to red then green. I went to the bathroom and decided to see if it was still there when I came out. It was still there so I stayed for a brief period of time and watched it.  It continued to change color and was VERY bright. Brighter then any other object in the sky including all the stars.  I went to bed and just assumed it was a star or something. Later that same day I was talking to my roommate and told him what I saw and we both decided to wait and see if it was there that night. The night of Aug. 30-31 we went and checked to see if the light was there. At around 12:30am on Aug. 31 the light was there again. Both my roommate and myself saw this bright light. My roommate went to bed and I decided to stay up and watch this strange bright light. It still changed from white to red and then green, but this time I noticed it would sway to the right, then the left, then up and final down. It did this for quite sometime and then I decided to go to bed. We both continued to check for this same light the next two nights and it hasnâ€™t been back at all. I have not left my address or last name as I don't want both to be exposed to the public. If you need to contact me, please feel free to email me.
