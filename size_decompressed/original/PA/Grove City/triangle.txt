A friend of mine heard on his police scanner that a V shaped object was spotted hovering over the local hospital several weeks ago. This is what I heard.  More info. is coming to me everyday.  A V shaped object was seen hovering over the local hospital. Several of the hospital employee when out to see what it was.  I heard that it had 4 lights on each side and was very large.  They called the local police and they came to see what it was.  When they got there they made everyone go inside and reported on the scanner that they had no idea what it was.I also heard from another friend that his mother was driving home from work several days ago .  She was traveling from Grove City to Slippery Rock (PA).  As she was leaving the city she saw this thing in the sky that was black and huge. A blue beam came from the object and it followed her all the way to Slippery Rock (5miles).  I am trying to get names and info. from the local police. When I do I will email you.;41.1607;-80.0841
Multiple objects sighted at different altitudes over Grove City PA;2007-05-21 12:40:00;3 min;Multiple objects sighted at different altitudes over Grove City PA 3 witnesses seen two odd lights moving north. Both seemed to me to be far out of out atmosphere. One low on the horizon and one up about 45 degrees. The speed is hard to judge without a reference. My gut feeling says there were going well over 500mph possibly 1000mph. Size? bigger than my mind can grasp.  Only several minutes later, A light appeared on the horizon. As it traveled north east, You could clearly see 3 lights in a triangle. They had a slight gold tint to them. After the 3 of us compared notes, we all came up with a rough altitude of 5000' and it only was going between 100 to 300 mph...kinda slow but in a deliberate and straight line. We estimate the width to be 75 to 200' wide. I have a background in electronic repair and in my spare time I design, build and fly radio control planes.;41.1607;-80.0841
Strange shadowy and Transparent triangular/boomerang shaped object steadily moving across the sky.;2018-04-13 21:18:00;20 seconds;Strange shadowy and Transparent triangular/boomerang shaped object steadily moving across the sky. We were stargazing and we suddenly saw a shadowy and seemingly transparent triangular/boomerang shaped object, with regularly spaced white patches.  It moved steadily across the sky from SE to NE and made no noise.   Before we had gotten over the surprise, another one, exactly the same and going the same direction appeared and moved across the sky just like the first.  We have never seen anything like it and have no clue what it could have been.;41.1607;-80.0841
