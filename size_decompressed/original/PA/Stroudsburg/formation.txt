At 11:45 PM EST, my wife and I witnessed a series of 6-7 flying objects move in a mainly  east to west formation, one after the other, over the hills of the Poconos.  Two of the objects rose quickly in the sky to appear as the size of stars and had the intensity of stars but flashed multi-colored lights.  These two objects have remained in the same position for the past 30 minutes since, 11:45 PM, as I am typing this report.   The other 4-5 flying objects flew by much closer in our line of vision, appeared cylindrical, flashing red, white, green lights but then seemed to grow smaller in size once directly in front of our line of vision, and directly underneath the two stationary UFOs, and maintained a smaller outward glow of either red or white light.  While witnessing these UFOs, the sky lit up brightly in flashes, but there was no lightning.  One note of surprise is that I witnessed an orange flash of light coming down from the sky, appearing as if it were 50-60 feet away from me and much like how a fountain firecracker would, while watching the UFOs.;40.9859999999999;-75.2435999999998
