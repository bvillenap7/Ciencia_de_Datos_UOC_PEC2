Fourth sighting of UFOs in the week at the same location.;2012-09-08 02:00:00;4 hours;Fourth sighting of UFOs in the week at the same location. For the fourth time this week, my wife and I have witnessed a series of UFOs over the sky of Stroudsburg, PA late at night.  Last night we witnessed 8 floating orbs in a T shape formation which must have been at least 4-5 football field lengths in total area hovering to the east over the Delaware River from our home.  The orbs hovered in the same formation for 3-4 hours but moved rapidly left to right, right to left, up and down sporadically and independently.  The orbs moved 1/2 mile closer at one point to where we were and then back to their original position, at least in perception based on the size of the orbs and positioning in the sky.  The orbs emanated bright white light mostly but sometimes flashed red, orange or green lights and did not appear hazy.;40.9859999999999;-75.2435999999998
