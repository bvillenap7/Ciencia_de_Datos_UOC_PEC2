I have seen this\ strange spheres  many times over the past 3 to 4 years. I dont know what to think of this strange objects that pulsate a bluish violet light and then dissapear completely out of sight.  The first encounter with this strange spherical lights was back in july of of 1994 when I was oustide my apartment ironing a shirt and just for a brief moment I looked up and saw what apeared to be a spherical bluish violet ball of light hovering with no noise and at very low altitude around 300 feet of the ground to my amazement it slowly began to disapear right where it was hovering. I wish I had a camera recorder to document this strange anomalies and submitted as proof of my encounter with this strange objects......;40.9859999999999;-75.2435999999998
