I am a 40 year old mother of three,my husband is 35.My husband and I had just retired to the bedroom for the evening. As we lie there a bright blue light coming from the backyard lit the entire ceiling of our bedroom. As quickly as it came it faded only to be followed by a red light of the same intensity. Along with the lights was an electrical sounding hum.These lights repeated but now on the side of our home leaving the backyard in total darkness.There wasn't a power outage in our home because none of the digital clocks were affected. It was snowing at the time but I am unaware of any type of unusual weather occurances that could produce such an effect. Also transformers are not located anywhere in the vicinity of the lights had one blown. A neighbor having seen the same lights at the same time, from across the street experienced a power outage on that side of the street for four hours following the incident.;40.9859999999999;-75.2435999999998

I was looking west/northwest following the path of a commercial airline headed south.  I looked above and looked at what I thought was a star.  The light was a pale white, light blue.  It was stationary, made a twinkle and the light faded.  There were no passing clouds, even though the sky was hazy I was able to see the other stars.;40.9859999999999;-75.2435999999998
