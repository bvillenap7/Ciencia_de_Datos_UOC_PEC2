Glowing orange center.   Moved slowly across the sky, no sound whatsoever, and went out one by one, like turning off a light switch.   Wife and I witnessed 2 orange fireballs/lights appearing separately and moving fast, no sound at all.  Each one disappeared within minutes of one another.;40.9859999999999;-75.2435999999998
Slow Yellow lights turning into fireballs moving at extreme speed across the sky;2017-12-29 22:00:00;4 minutes;Slow Yellow lights turning into fireballs moving at extreme speed across the sky I was driving and saw 3 bright yellow lights that had a tail which lit up the sky and was shooting down  right in front of me.  First reaction was that these were jets, then they turned bright red and looked to be on fire and I thought they were meteors.  They stopped and made a hard left and shot across the sky at a high rate of speed looking like they were going back up and disappeared.  I took a photo while driving of the yellow lights and I pulled over took a video of the last fireball in the sky, which was moving at extreme speeds.   A guy behind me also pulled over and got out of his car and was like I never saw anything like that in my life.;40.9859999999999;-75.2435999999998
