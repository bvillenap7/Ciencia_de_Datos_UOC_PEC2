Flying wing observed in pennsylvania on september 14 2008;2008-09-14 19:20:00;3 minutes;Flying wing observed in pennsylvania on september 14 2008 Walking home from a party three people observed what appeared to be a flying wing.  It seamed ragged in appearance, and was flying fairly close to the ground.  It made no noise, and its shape did not fluctuate.  It appeared initially to be two birds flying together, but there was no flapping of wings.  When it was first sighted, the object was parallel to the horizon, but shifted to perpendicular after about two minutes.  The object was observed through 7x binoculars but was, at that point, two far away to be identified.  The object was not moving in a decaying trajectory, thus ruling out a falling item.  It made no sudden accelerations, and exhibited no lights.  After about three minutes of observation the object disappeared behind the trees.  The object seemed to be about 12 feet long ad three feet wide.  No further observations were made. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));40.9859999999999;-75.2435999999998
Starlike looking object that visibly moves across the sky in straight lines, and in random circular patterns.;2019-04-15 19:30:00;continual;Starlike looking object that visibly moves across the sky in straight lines, and in random circular patterns. Have witnessed several times, on clear starry nights a star that moves at times in straight lines across the sky - and at other times in random circular patterns.  Visible to the naked eye, looks like a star. Have observed with binoculars as well.  Using the binoculars appears as though there are two stars (one larger - one smaller) , and upon closer inspection they at times circle each other.  When they are moving across the sky, one of the star appears to pull the other.  When the star moves in random circular patterns, the white dots circle each other.;40.9859999999999;-75.2435999999998
