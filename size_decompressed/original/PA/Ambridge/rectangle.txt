It moved slowly acrossed the sky then it just zipped away. My neighbors and I were talking to each other.  I was in the backyard and they were in the alley right beside my house when I noticed something in the sky.  It was about as long as half of a normal sized toothpick and it was silvery white.  It moved slowly acrossed the sky for about 7 seconds and then zipped away very, very fast.;40.6005;-80.2105
