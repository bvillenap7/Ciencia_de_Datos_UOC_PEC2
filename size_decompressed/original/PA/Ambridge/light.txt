Four Bright yellow lights in night sky  following each other then vanished upwards and disappeared.;2012-05-11 22:00:00;2 minutes;Four Bright yellow lights in night sky  following each other then vanished upwards and disappeared. About 10pm on Friday night I saw what appeared to be a bright yellow helicopter headlight in the  northern sky coming toward Ambridge, PA.   We often see helicopters flying over headed to Pittsburgh so I watched it approaching.  As it got closer I noticed there was no engine noise, then I saw a second light exactly the same rising up behind it, followed by a 3rd and a 4th.   All tailing behind each other but each at a lower altitude.  As the first light was getting closer to me in the sky it also appeared to be going higher up until it vanished altogether.  The remaining lights all followed the same path upwards and vanished in front of each other.  This whole process lasted about 2 minutes.;40.6005;-80.2105
