I was travelling with my three teenage children south on Freeport Road and I noticed an orange object in the sky approaching from the southeast.  I pointed it out to my son who also saw the object.  It travelled to our location as we stopped at a red light at the intersection of Freeport Road and Alabama Avenue.  The object stopped directly above us and we opened the car windows and looked straight up at the motionless quiet object. All four of use saw the object.  It was circular in shape and orange in color.  Orange flames were shooting out of the bottom as if it were a rocket.  The object made no noise and just hovered in that position.  When the light turned green we moved and the object moved a short distance in the same direction and then vanished.  We attempted to get a video, but it is poor quality as it was taken with an I-phone and is very short.;40.6421;-79.7273
