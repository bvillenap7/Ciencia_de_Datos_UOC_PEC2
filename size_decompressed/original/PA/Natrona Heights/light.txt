I looked out the window to see what looked like an all black helicopter, with four bright red lights on what looked like the wing. It was flying very low to the trees and disappeared over the tree line. It was very loud. I noticed over in the distance, high in the sky, too high up to be a drone, is a disk looking object, with pulsating lights of red, green, blue and white. I can see a white beam of light come from it, and it is hovering in the sky in the same spot, but hovering, if you watch closely you can see it hovering in the same spot, but moving around as if it’s flying in a small circumference. It’s going on an hour now. This object did not show up on my camera.;40.6421;-79.7273
