6-7 Orange/Red UFOs;2020-12-31 18:00:00;6 minutes around;6-7 Orange/Red UFOs On New Year’s Eve, 2020, at about 6 p.m, I was with my mother driving to the bank on the way home.  As I turned a corner on the street for a bank, i noticed bright orange/red things flying in the sky.  There were about three of them who traveled close together.  I went to park and they were flying above us and disappeared before our eyes.  Then two more appeared behind a McDonalds it seemed, but it was just so high in the sky.  They went to where the previous went and disappeared very very high above us.  Two more then came and the same thing happened. My mom said it was lanterns and I knew it wasn’t.  I was recording and when I zoomed in I was amazed.  It was a ginormous reddish-orange energy looking ball that was seemingly pulsating in and out to gain speed.  It kind of looked like the bottom of a UFO like it was traveling sideways.  On the inside of the orbs there was another circle inside another circle.  I have footage as well.;40.3553;-75.32
