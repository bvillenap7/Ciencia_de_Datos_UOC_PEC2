Triangle craft that split up into three speeding crafts with white lights and little to no sound;2005-02-01 19:00:00;2 minutes;Triangle craft that split up into three speeding crafts with white lights and little to no sound My daughter and I were in our driveway and through the trees in our backyard saw bright white lights (no noise) and we stopped and looked and it looked like a triangle, very large with three distinct points and hovered over the trees for a second and then the three points seemed to break off and fly close together, extremely fast.  We were getting in the car anyway and decided to follow them as best as we could.  We noticed them only for a couple of minutes and then lost sight of them.  This was the strangest thing I have ever seen!;41.4833;-75.7171
