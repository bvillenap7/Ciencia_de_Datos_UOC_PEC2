WHILE STANDING IN THE PARKING LOT OF WHERE I WORK,  I SAW A BROWNISH OBJECT HOVERING IN THE SKY ABOVE WITH NO SOUND.  IN REFERENCE TO THE JET THAT HAD JUST PASSED OVER AT ABOUT 30-35000 FT.  I WOULD SAY THIS OBJECT WAS ABOUT 10000 FT. LOWER. AT THIS TIME ANOTHER EMPLOYEE CAME OUTSIDE AND WITNESSED WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT.  WE COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS.  WE BOTH WATCHED IN DISBELIEF AND DISCUSSED WHAT WE WERE WATCHING.  IT HUNG AROUND FOR ABOUT A ONE AND A HALF MINUTES AND THEN WE BOTH WATCHED IT RACE ACROSS THE SKY TO THE EAST .   THIS OBJECT TRAVELED FASTER THAN ANYTHING WE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED IN OUR LIVES !!!!!!!!    IT WAS GONE ACROSS THE SKY AND DISAPPEARED IN ABOUT 2 SECONDS!!!!!
