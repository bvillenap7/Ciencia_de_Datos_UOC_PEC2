I look up and saw an object that looked like a ball cut in half-the bottom flat side having red lights around the edge,then many other colors following to the inside of the circle.  It was hovering oover a very small residential area and the lights kept surging bright and dim. it was 3 dimential, I could see it perfectly. As it hovered, it seemed to be rocking back and forth like a bell would do ,in fact,the top of the ball seemed to be narrower  at the top like an upside down funnel (but without the spout).
