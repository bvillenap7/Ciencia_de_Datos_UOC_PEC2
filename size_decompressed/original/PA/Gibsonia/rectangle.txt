My grandparents live 3 doors down from us there 80 years old they called me up this morning saying none Of there veichles are starting(all new and push to start)  I went up there and tried everything tried jumping the cars changing the batteries on there remote nothing worked so we called triple A.  as we were waiting their 86 year old neighbor came over said none of his cars are working either all remote or push to start which was weird.that 2 houses right next to each other had the same exact issues.we got to talking wondering if it was a cyber attack or something but he claims he saw a flying black rectangular object.we thought he was just that crazy old guy.then the triple A employee shows up we get to talking he was able to bypass the fobs key battery the worker then went to explain he saw a flying object in the sky before we even mentioned it he saw the ufo about 30 mins away from our house and explained it without any knowledge of us seeing it either.we finically got the cars running but wondering if anyone saw anything;40.6217;-79.9431
