Three yellow light shapes moving in erratic formations;2013-11-09 20:45:00;30 minutes;Three yellow light shapes moving in erratic formations I noticed three odd yellowish lights when I took my dog out, then realized that they were moving rather erratically around each other and through the sky above our neighborhood.   They seemed to follow along with me when I walked back to my house to get my daughter, then with both of us when we went to get two different sets of neighbors.  We racked our brains trying to figure out if they could be reflections or flash lights or have some rational explanation, but really there was none.  Then one by one, they went up and were gone.  Interestingly, my dog, who usually follows me everywhere, sat very still at the edge of our driveway while this was happening.   I tried to take video on my iPhone, but was unable because they didn't show up on the screen.;40.6217;-79.9431
There were 4 main bright orange lights flying/hovering over the southeastern horizon with 2 larger lighters tailing the formation.;2013-11-12 19:30:00;10-30 minutes;There were 4 main bright orange lights flying/hovering over the southeastern horizon with 2 larger lighters tailing the formation.   The objects flew below the cloud cover for about 10-30 minutes before they suddenly disappeared.   The objects seemed to be moving in a follow the leader pattern but never moved great distances.;40.6217;-79.9431
