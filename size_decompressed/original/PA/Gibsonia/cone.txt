Strange coned shaped light setting still and silent in the eastern night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.

We were planning on having a small to roast marshmallows.  I was looking up at the hill while they were collecting wood and they were about 50 yards away loading wood into our ‘Ranger’ or off roading vehicle and they left it running so they could not hear me.  As I was looking up at the night sky I noticed a strange coned shaped yellow light coming from a cloud.  I yelled up to the girls asking them to look and what did they think it was, but they could not hear me.  I then looked around and didn’t notice any other clouds in the sky.  The reason we were having the fire was to sit out and enjoy the night sky because it was so clear.  The light came down from the sky the way a bulb would emit light into a cone shape with it smaller at the top and larger at the bottom.  It was nothing that covered the whole sky but it was! definitely not light from a plane or helicopter. Neither was it the sun because the light was in the east and there was no moon at that time during the evening.   It stood still with no noise and the top of the cone was covered with the small cloud.  The light was there for around 45 seconds and within a couple of seconds it disappeared from the bottom up, almost as if it fizzled away. The cloud also disappeared immediately after.
