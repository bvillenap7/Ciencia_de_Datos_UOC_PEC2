My husband and I were just relaxing and looking at the stars like we always do when he said look at this coming. I observed two disc shaped objects. They looked like two plates or saucers standing on end. They were traveling at a very high rate of speed from east to west. They looked as if they were racing each other. One was a small distance behind the other but, they crossed directly over us the gap between them closed and they were side by side. Never have I witnessed anything travel at such a high rate of speed. From what I could estimate they were about the same height as commercial jets that we have seen. The sky was very clear and full of stars. The objects were a orange color, no flashing lights. They looked illuminated , not real bright, but like a glow.;40.7391;-79.5154
