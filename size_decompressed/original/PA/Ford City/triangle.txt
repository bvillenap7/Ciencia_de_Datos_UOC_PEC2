I observed two objects crossing the sky from east to west at a height we normally see a commercial jet fly. When I first observed them there was a considerably gap between the two craft. As the objects passed over me the gap closed and they were side by side until they were out of sight. The objects were reddish orange in color, no blinking lights, but like a continuous light outlining the craft. The objects were triangled shape and moved at a very high rate of speed.;40.7391;-79.5154
