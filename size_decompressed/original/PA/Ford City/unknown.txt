Eight orange hovering orbs.;2011-10-08 21:15:00;several minutes;Eight orange hovering orbs. My husband was walking on our street to our car that was parked around the corner.  When he reached the corner he called for me to come and see something in the sky.  When I joined him I looked in the direction that he was indicating. I saw 8 large orange orbs that were hovering in a row.  They were large and very bright which made it difficult to ascertain their shape.  They continued to hover for several minutes. Eventually 7 of them started traveling to the right and away from us and one appeared to be coming closer for maybe a minute or less and then it followed the other 7.  We did not hear any sound coming from them. We have since found out that there were people in a neighboring community that also witnessed this siting.;40.7391;-79.5154
