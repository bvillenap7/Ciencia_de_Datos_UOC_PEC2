After looking at the pictures, that were taken in rapid succession, something appears in the second picture that does not appear in the first or third picture.   He is an ex-Air Force officer and is quite familiar with planes.  He doesn't believe it is a plane in the background I believe it could be.   I thought I would send the picture for your review.;40.5662;-79.7078
