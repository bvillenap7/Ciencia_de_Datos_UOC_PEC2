Basball size ball of light moves 6 inches over car and up windshield.;1990-05-01 20:30:00;15 minutes;Basball size ball of light moves 6 inches over car and up windshield. Parked near a lake in a park. Boats had just come in and left from the area. A light appeared and began to move very fast across the lake. Though it might have been another boat. It moved over the lake, across the hill side and then flew at a steady speed 3-5 MPH across the hood of my car and up the windsheild. About 6in over car. It was just a baseball sizw ball of green/blue light. Able to see it up close when it moved over car. It did not blink. It was just a steady light. Seemed to be searching. Me and the friend I was with were frightened and left in a hurry. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411

They moved across in groups of 4-5 and all originated in the same place and disappeared about the same place.
