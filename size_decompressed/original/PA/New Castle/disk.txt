We drove to the store to get ice cream. It was about 3 miles away.  Coming home we were coming down the hill and I noticed a bright star/light above us straight ahead in the sky.  As I came down the hill I had to make a left turn to get on my road.  The star made a 90 degree turn, too! I thought that was odd... then about 1/2 mile down I made a left into our long driveway and it went above my car and hovered over our garage.  It was disc shaped. Very plain.  No lights, no sound, no wind, no windows, no rivets or seams. It was a satin dull nickel  color.   I got out of the car and looked at it. It was no more than 10 feet above our garage.  It was approximately 20-30 feet in diameter.  It didn’t have any bubble top and it had a slight convex bottom.  It didn’t do anything. Then after about 45 seconds it just moved out and took off over the ! woods in our backyard.  I saw it.  My brother was too young to remember much.  He didn’t get out if the car until I said let’s go tell mom and dad.  We went in the front door and told.  They didn’t know what to say.  I wasn’t afraid.;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411
Orange disk-shaped objects that fly under the clouds without sound.;2012-07-04 21:30:00;30 minutes;Orange disk-shaped objects that fly under the clouds without sound. One object in the northeast sky. Two objects in the northern sky. Orange in color. One of the objects from the west of the sighting position reappeared under the oncoming storm as a orange ball then went dark, however this revealed the object to be round and then went into the clouds. Then as I am typing this two more sightings, same shape and color.;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411
