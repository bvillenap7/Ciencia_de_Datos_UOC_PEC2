Unexplained object flys over head then quickly vanishes.;2008-07-29 23:47:00;3-10 seconds;Unexplained object flys over head then quickly vanishes. 7/29/2008  	While sitting down in my hot tub to relax myself. I began to look at the stars like I usually do. While gazing upon the stars, I happened to sight a star that looked different. It kind of looked like two stars joined together in an hour glass kind of shape. The object appeared hazy and remained still for a few minutes. As I took my eyes off of the object I looked around and then I brought my attention back to this object. When making eye contact again the object had shifted position and appeared to be moving. After checking my vision, I looked harder at the object and it was definitely moving, in a diagonal direction. Then in a split second it changed direction and began to fly straight towards me. I watched the object come closer to me, then with no hesitation, the object changed direction as if turning away from me. And in a split second the moving object appeared to dim off and disappear. This happened all within a 30-60 second time period.;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411

My dad is the only witness that I know so far.;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411
Four strangely shaped orange/ red orbs floating across sky in PA.;2013-07-13 21:50:00;10 minutes;Four shtangly shaped orange/ red orbs floating across sky in PA. Me and my girlfriend were waiting for a firework show to begin when we noticed 4 oddly shaped red/orange orbs floating across the sky going from south to north.  Two were floating in close proximity one above the other they traveled slowly but vanished within minutes.   We looked around wondering if anyone else had seen it and were disappointed.  Within minutes however another appeared flying much faster and it too vanished rapidly.   We  then saw what appeard to be a plane traveling in the same direction but it too vanished.  The final orb was going slower but instead of getting smaller or becoming faint like the others it seemed to flicker and go out.   As you can imagine we began looking all over the sky  quite nervous and sure enough we saw several smaller white lights flickering.   Two appeared to be stars but one went out and the other fell.   The fire work show progressed without anyone else taking notice but during the show there were two flashes in the area of t! he fallen UFO.   We are rather worried because we were in an area over looking the city and seemed to be the only ones to notice.   I would also like to add that me and my girlfriend both tried to take pictures on our cell phones and though we could see the images clearly on the screens once we took the picture you could not see the UFO's any longer.   I am a full time cook and my girlfriend is currently an employee at an ambulance service as an EMT.;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411
