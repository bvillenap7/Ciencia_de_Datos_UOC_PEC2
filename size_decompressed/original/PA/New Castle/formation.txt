formation of bright orange lights seen moving across the night sky from north to south and then disappears;2010-09-25 22:00:00;1 minute;formation of bright orange lights seen moving across the night sky from north to south and then disappears On Saturday, September 25, 2010 at 10:00 p.m. my husband, me and two friends exited a local restaurant in New Castle, PA.  The restaurant is located on E. Washington St.  My husband looked up and asked, What is that?    We looked up and saw a formation of 14 bright orange lights moving from north to south coming toward us.   My friend ran into the restaurant and told everyone what we saw and at least three people came out and saw this.  There was traffic on the street and I saw some of the drivers looking up at the sky but I don’t know if they were looking up because we were or because they saw the formation of lights.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but it was too dark. The formation moved as one unit, there was no sound,  and no blinking lights.  Once it moved over our heads heading south, it seemed to just disappear.  It is hard to explain the formation, there was one light in the front and one in the back the other twelve lights were in a two by two formation in between, but not side by side. It was a mostly clear night. The temperature was approximately 50 degrees. I am a 57 year old retired secretary, my husband is a 60 year old retired steelworker, and our two friends are in their late 40’s.  I have to add that I never believed in UFO’s until I saw this.  I have no other explanation for what we saw. I would like to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like this formation.;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411
8 orange lights seen over New Castle, PA;2013-04-13 23:14:00;5 minutes;8 orange lights seen over New Castle, PA I was travelling eastbound on Route 422 south of New Castle, PA on 4/13/2013 at 2314. I witnessed eight orange lights to my north. The color was similar in nature to the orange lights used to illuminate roads near interchanges. I pulled the truck over about a mile from the Route 65 exit.  This afforded me a clear view across the valley to my north. The lights appeared to travel out of the north to the southeast in a loose trail formation with the lead light about one mile ahead of the other 7. I shut off the enhine and the radio. I did not hear any sound that would indicate rotors, propellors, or turbine engines. I am very accustomed to these sounds as I was a helicopter crewchief inthe Army and an aircraft technician for a number of years.  The lights faded from view one at a time (lead light first) before they had even gotten to the north end of the valley.  They did not display aircraft anti-collision lights, navigation lights, or landing lights.  The orange ! glow cast form these objects was constant (did not flicker, flash or change colors) until it faded. From the moment I first viewed these lights until the last one faded from view was about four minutes long.  Lat/Long of my position could not be obtained (didn't have my GPS). Lat/Long can be obtained as well as an asmuth to the location of the first light's location when it faded from view and the last light's location at the same time (the first faded from view before it entered the constallation Libra.;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411
