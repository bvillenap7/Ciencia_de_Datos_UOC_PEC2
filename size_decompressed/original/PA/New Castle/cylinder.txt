I fell off of the 4-wheeler and laided on the ground and looked at the sky.  Right above me hovered a cylinder shaped object in the sky.  I told my father to look up and sure enough he seen the same object I did.  My sister was only about 6 at the time, but she also seen it.  My mother was in the kitchen and saw us looking up so she did and she went to get a camera.  As we watched outside 5 airplanes started towards the craft in the sky and it shot off without a trace.  Of course the camera was to late, so we didn't get a piture.  We called about the 5 planes that tried to go after the object, the airport in the area said it hadn't had any flights take off in the last hour. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
