Bright lights were blinding us and we heard a soft hum.;1978-09-16 21:00:00;2 minutes;Bright lights were blinding us and we heard a soft hum. As my Mother and I left our ceramics class to go to our car we heard a soft hum and then lights were shining on us.  Because the lights were blinding us, we couldn’t see what was above us.  It seemed to be only 30 feet above us.  We kind of froze because we were scared and didn’t know what it was.  It kept getting closer and coming lower in a neighborhood with telephone poles.  We were out there for a couple of minutes, then ran back into our ceramic teacher's house. The next day in the news paper, it was reported that a blimp had been in the area and that’s what everyone one had seen.   I can’t remember if my Mother called the State police and reported it, but we received forms to fill out from the government.  We filled them out and sent them in.  We may have gotten a call about it because I remember my Mother saying, why would they take a chance at night coming so close to houses.  I think they told her that the blimp operators were trying to scare people.  She said, well it worked. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
