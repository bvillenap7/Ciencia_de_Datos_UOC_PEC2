I was outside on my front porch smoking.  A bright star that looked to be changing color from white to red caught my eye.   As I lifted my eyes to look directly at it, a bright white ball of light came out of nowhere and shot down toward toward the ground.  It didn't go straight down, rather it kind of arched down.   Then before it could hit the ground, or at least right before I'd have lost view of it due to houses, the light just shut off.   I got scared and ran into the house.  So I  don't know if it reappeared or not.  I'm writing this report just minutes after this happened. I went straight to the Internet to see if anyone else reported seeing this and to see what a meteor falling looks like.  This was not a meteor. I found this website while looking up bright white light falling from sky and added my area in the search field.   Thank you for this website, I'm grateful I'm able to talk about this to someone without feeling or being called crazy.;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411
