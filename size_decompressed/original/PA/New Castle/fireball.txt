Orange sphere witnessed streaking over New Castle Pa;2005-11-03 21:00:00;5 seconds;Orange sphere witnessed streaking over New Castle Pa On November 3rd at about 9:00 pm I was driving  on the Pa turnpike in the New Castle Pa area.   I observed a bright Orange sphere, streaking acrossed the sky.  The object was far below cloud level.  The object had a dark center, with an intense orange fire all around the outer edge.   The object was streaking towards Pittsburgh at a very high speed.  After about 5 seconds, the object completely disappeared without changing altitude.;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411
Witnessed 12-15 larger-than-stars orbs hover over New Castle, Pa, then slowly dim a few at a time.;2010-09-25 10:10:00;90 seconds?;Witnessed 12-15 larger-than-stars orbs hover over New Castle, Pa, then slowly dim a few at a time. On Sep. 25,2010, at approximately 10:10, while driving west(toward downtown) in New Castle, Pa,myself, my fiancee and our 5 yr. old son saw 12-15 vibrant orange lights in the sky. They were at least twice the size of nearby stars, and gave the impression of movement(almost vibrating?) but not actually getting anywhere(hovering) for approximately 90 seconds. We drove very slowly to watch and to avoid hitting a few other cars that had stopped or slowed to witness the same thing. Then one or two at a time, they slowly dimmed to nothing.  Have not seen anything else this evening. This is the apparent shape of the entire fleet: * *     * *    * *  *   * *     *  * *  *   * * I am a 27 yr. old female, and my fiancee is 30.;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411
There were 10 orb shaped balls, the color of fire.;2010-09-25 22:05:00;3 minutes;There were 10 orb shaped balls, the color of fire. Our children were outside, getting ready to walk their friend home.  One of the neighbor kids ran into the house to get us, yelling come see this.  We ran outside and the kids pointed to the sky. We looked up, and that is when we seen ten orb shaped balls.  They were the color of fire.  It did not seem like there were lights on the orbs, they seemed to be glowing.  They were in some type of formation. Then they just disappeared.  They didn't fly away, they just disappeared. We immidiately called 911 to find out what was happening.  They told us that so many people had called about this incident.  They said they did not know what was happening, and they told us that they had called the ufo center hotline.  When we got off the phone with 911, we looked up the ufo hotline number and called them ourselves.  We left our name and number on the answering machine. Some one called us back within a half hour.  He said other people had called too, and that they were trying to find out what is going on.;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411
