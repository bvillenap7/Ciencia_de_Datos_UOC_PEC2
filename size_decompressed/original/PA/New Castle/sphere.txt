Several orange, red  spheres, moving in horizontal formation except for 2 were in vertical formation.  One sped up.;2014-12-23 22:00:00;5 minutes;several  orange, red spheres moving in horizontal formation except for 2 were in vertical formation, watched  one speed  up and go be Out for  a walk with dog  that cold, clear and vey calm night.  Stopped to let dog do his business and looked up and saw orange, red ball of light moving from north to south.  I thought why would someone be lighting Chinese lanterns on a night like tonight, then I ruled out not a plane or helicopter.  No sound at all, and did not seem real high, maybe as high as helicopters normally fly.  Then I looked  north  and saw another  one coming, and then another, that was 3, they were  in a straight line formation, then as i look  north, i see 2 of them coming in a vertical  formation, spread apart  maybe 3 or 400 yards apart and they come overhead.  No sound and dont seam to be real high, as im watching i can see a couple jets way up in sky.   Then, as the 2 vertical  ones went by another, one come overhead, and I watched it speed  up to catch up with  the 2, and when it went in between  the two it glow went out.  That's  when I couldn't  believe what i was seeing. After that, 2 more went over, and as they going away from me, their light just seemed to disappear as they got so far away from me.  I know for fact not Chinese lanterns, not an airplane, and definitely no helicopter.   Had to ufo's or some kind of government  project, just wish someone  was with me when i saw them, dog had no clue.   Went on internet  that night  and saw similar  video  of what I saw..  Made hair stand  up on back of my neck!  Very  unexplainable.....;41.0039955882353;-80.3338823529411
