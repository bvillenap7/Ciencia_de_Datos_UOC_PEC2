The ship was beyond the abilities of our race and time;1990-06-15 03:00:00;1/2 hr.;The ship was beyond the abilities of our race and time The ship was black small dome at front top with windows. it was massive in size .  it seemed to be semi transparent. I stopped at side of highway it apeared in the sky again not far from me.  I looked at it and it looked at me for about 15 seconds.  It went over the top of me and into a speed beyond reality. It had a form of antigravity .  it moved over the hills always at the same level from the ground. The shape was different in every way.  It seemed to be built to fill its needs for space from what was inside the craft. I first noticed the ship when driving down the highway.  It was across the highway from me going east bound.  It would be there for a short time then it would be gone and then back again then gone again. This was the reason I stopped.   Also there was no sound or any breese or fire when it flew off.

Strange flying lights plane's don't do that.;2015-02-26 19:20:00;1 minute;Strange flying lights plane's don't do that. I am making this ufo report, in hopes that if others seen it, they might be more like to report what they seen. 	I was walking into where I work, I was walking east, and saw 2 rows of 5 lights moving from north to south, each set of lights was about 2 fingers  widths at arms length, and about 8 fingers width between the 2 separate objects.  It was about 7:20 pm February 26th.  28 years working here, I know the view very well.  I noticed these two lights, but took them to be airplanes, flying toward me.  They looked big, but this is how the mind rationalized what I saw.  As I walked, things didn’t look right.  I stopped and used a distant light pole to see the direction or flight. That’s where things didn’t line up.  I could see 5 lights on each, so if it was a plane, it has to be moving toward me.  Such that I would be seeing headlights of a big plane. But I was due east, and they were going south.  There motion was slow, but not unremarkable for planes at a distance of several miles, at about 4 fingers, at arm's length, above the ground. What happened next, is the thing that puts this into ufo category.  This 1st set of lights, turns near vertical, to about 80 degrees.  Which is nuts for any airplane that big and that low. But even more odd, is that the forward leading light tilted down.  Such that if this were a plane, it would be turning very sharply south.  Because I am thinking it moving toward me” because of the lights”, but it was already moving south before the turn.  What I saw, was the light go out or turn from view, going north not south.  How can a plane, moving south, turn to go north, where the leading light go down to 80 degrees, they didn’t go back to level, just “looked” to turn out of view.  The turn was too sharp, and the tilt was in the wrong direction, the plane were too close to each other, and too low.  This turn was in about 8 finger widths, and I’m being generous.  Then the other set of lights followed, but faster. If a plane was going south, I should not have seen so many lights.  If the plane were moving east “ which it wasn’t” then to turn north, the northern most light tilt down to bank north.  I just can’t see how a normal plane can do what I saw.;40.2076477011495;-77.2136017241377
Loud long transparent craft with red lights on each end;2015-08-15 21:00:00;2 Minutes;Loud long transparent craft with red lights on each end On August 15th 2015 around 9 pm my daughter and I were in the living room watching TV when what sounded like a helicopter went over our home.  I looked out the window and I could see a long craft that looked to be transparent with a red lights on each end.  I told my daughter to follow me outside so we could get a better look . Once outside, I thought I would be able to see the bottom of a craft, but neither of us could make out anything but the lights.  It looked to be just a long transparent craft that sounded like a helicopter. It was very low.   My husband and I tried to look up drone pictures but couldn't find anything that looked like this.  I'm sure other people had to of seen it and would like to know what it was if anyone has and information. We see tons of odd things where we live and I know they some times have air shows. My husband also witnessed a large orange orb in 2006 floating above our home. We had just moved in. He said it made no sound.  Floated off and never seen anything like it again. In 2014, my family witnessed silver cylinder like crafts that seemed to be equally paced one in front of the other. I lost count at how many were line.  At first I assumed it was a airplane but I would have no idea why they would be lined up or the reason for so many.;40.2076477011495;-77.2136017241377
