UFO over South Central PA 5/26/14.;2014-05-26 15:00:00;3 minutes;UFO over South Central PA 5/26/14 After working in my yard on Memorial Day I was sitting on my front porch at 15:00 looking due east at the horizon.  At about 45 degrees east, north east I noticed an object in the sky.  I thought it might be a bald eagle circling for its prey.  However, the object was too high in the sky to be a bird.   As I looked further I noticed the object was hovering above something, as if it was observing something.  After noticing that the object was not moving, and having concluded it was not a bird, it suddenly zoomed off due east at fantastic speed.   I have never seen any aircraft that operated like that before.  It was either a government test vehicle (which I highly doubt) or a UFO.   About one half an hour later I noticed two high flying jets going both east to west and west to east at a high rate of speed.  Those both had contrails and were moving much more like traditional jets. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

While driving SE on Westminster Dr., I observed a shiny, circular object above the horizon.  The sky was mostly clear.  The sun was setting.  The object was small, round.  It was not an airplane or helicopter or drone.  I observed the object for two minutes while at a red light.  I lost sight of the object when the light turned green.  The object did not appear to move and was stationary.  It is possible that it was a low Earth satellite.;40.2076477011495;-77.2136017241377
