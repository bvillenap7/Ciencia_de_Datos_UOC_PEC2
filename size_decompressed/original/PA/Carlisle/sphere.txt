Fast moving blue ball of light;2012-04-22 21:30:00;3 seconds;Fast moving blue ball of light I was driving to Walmart and came to a stop.  It was an overcast night and pretty dark.   As I came to a stop I noticed a light blue almost aqua ball of light that must have been moving faster than mach 1.  I served several years on an aircraft carrier and know how fast a jet moves as it is doing a fly by in supersonic flight.   However, there was no sound what so ever.  It flew form south to north.   When I pulled into parking lot not more than 500 yards away there were no lights on the cloud, such a spot light or anything.  Never seen such a thing.

A shiny sphere with a black band appeared to be falling from the sky then darted west and out of sight.;2014-07-10 11:19:00;1 minute;A shiny sphere with a black band appeared to be falling from the sky then darted west and out of sight My 60 yr old sister, my 78 yr old mother and myself 51 yrs old, we're sitting in my backyard in town facing  south/west.  In the sky we saw a sphere that was shiny with a black band around it.  It appeared to be as if it were falling from the sky coming straight down.   It appeared out of no where, it made no sound, if we were not looking in that direction and up in the sky we would have never known it was there.   When it went behind the roof tops, we immediately ran towards the Main Street to see where it went and it darted west and it was all but out of sight in a split second.  This was not a plane or anything that we have ever seen before.;40.2076477011495;-77.2136017241377
