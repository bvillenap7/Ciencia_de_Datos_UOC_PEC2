2 very bright objects spotted  on sunny ,cloudless day;2010-03-18 10:00:00;4-5 minutes;2 very bright objects spotted  on sunny ,cloudless day Myself and 3 other men were cleaning up a lawn for spring, there had been a lot of geese flying overhead in the morning and I was looking up often to locate flocks.  As I was scanning the sky I noticed a very bright light that was moving forward and reversing directions to fly back where it was just at and also, hovering.  It was moving in smooth fluid motions, not in a jerky manner. The flash from this object was very bright and constant.  We were watching this object for a couple of minutes as it was moving about the sky.  All of a sudden, we noticed another bright light in the sky fairly close to the first one sighted.  The second object seemed to be moving in a circular or looping motion.  The four of us continued watching these objects for another minute or so until both objects were either to far to see them any longer or they disappeared/vanished.  We did not see the second object moving towards the first object at all during this incident, it seemed ! to just appear close to it. When I returned home later in the day I tried to duplicate the brightness of the steady flash from the objects, I put a piece of aluminum foil under my overhead kitchen light with the shiny side towards the light bulb to reflect the light.  Even that was not as bright as the objects we saw.This incident occurred on 3-18-2010 at about 10:00 AM.;40.2076477011495;-77.2136017241377
