I was cresting the top of a hill when I saw off in a distance,  2 bright oval shape lights above Biglerville.   My wife just happened to call me on the cell phone at the same time from home.  I told her to look in the sky behind our house for 2 lights.   She did report seeing both oval shaped lights.  They seemed to be above the field behind our house, heading toward Biglerville.   She said the 2 bright lights all at once changed directing, heading north, and disappeared together all at once.;39.9281;-77.2885
