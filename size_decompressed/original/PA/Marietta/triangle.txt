Slow and low flying triangular craft with lights some blinking with a slight engine sound;2004-10-06 22:15:00;1 minute;Slow and low flying triangular craft with lights some blinking with a slight engine sound The craft was triangular shaped with oval lights.  It was flying low enough that we thought it was a helicopter at first, but not so low that we could make out much detail.  It was moving very slow and had a quiet engine roar.  It definately had red lights and pretty sure that it had white lights, maybe blue (very patriotic I know).  The other peron said that perhaps it had some type of rear tail wings but I didn't see them.  It could have been some type of experimental plane because it didn't seem all that other-worldly except that it was triangluar, pretty quiet and flying so slow.  We also saw lots of planes flying around in the night sky that were up much higher.;40.0691;-76.5606
Black Triangular Craft Spotted 150ft above my house.;2017-10-18 20:00:00;5 seconds;Black Triangular Craft Spotted 150ft above my house. On this night of October 18, 2017,  My girlfriend and i just got back to my house from dinner.  We were talking in my car in my driveway for a bit, and out of the corner of my eye, i saw lights.  (What i saw)  Was a triangular craft with about 4 lights on each side, some were yellow, some were white, and one was red, in the middle.  It flew from behind a tree in my backyard, then i saw it for about 4-5 seconds, then it went into the trees and dissapeared.  I opened my door as soon as it left to see if there was a noise, and there wasnt.  It was about 150ft in the air, which is very low for an airplane, and i know what i saw.  It wasnt an airplane.  Nothing we have.  Personally, i am a UFO enthusiast and i know plently about eveything, so i could accept it and easily identify it as A triangular craft.  Now what my girlfriend saw, was what she describes as just about 10 yellow lights moving in unison without breaking formation, like fireflies. Im aware that there is a post here describing the same exact thing, In around the same area.;40.0691;-76.5606
