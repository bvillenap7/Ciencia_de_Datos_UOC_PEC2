5 objects moving throught the air in unison and glowing slightly orange.;2007-01-19 23:14:00;6 seconds;5 objects moving throught the air in unison and glowing slightly orange. I am a weather watcher and due to snow flurries in the area I walked out my back door and looked towards the north.   I saw a cluster of 5 shiny slightly orange glowing objects flying overhead.  I at first thought it was possibly baloons of some sort.   I noticed the objects were not gaining altitude and stayed very close to the clouds.  The objects stayed in the exact same distance from each other, but moved like a wheel in the air.   I have never seen anything like it.  I was frightened by what I was witnessing and decided to go back inside. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));40.2906;-76.9487
