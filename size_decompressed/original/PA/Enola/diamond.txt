Sting ray shape, ambient colorless orbs on bottom.;2013-10-09 21:45:00;15 minutes;sting ray shape, ambient colorless orbs on bottom Driving home from work I first saw it above the trees and thought it was some kind of stadium light used for construction at night (looked like he lights used at nighttime football games).  As i drove closer i noticed it moving, almost in a weaving pattern.  I noted that when it would lean and my view shifted from seeing only the bottom to partially the top, the top of the craft completely disappeared into the sky.  The lights on the bottom here spherical in shape and appeared to have no notable color, but would shift in an ambient way similar to the way a light show would.  It varied in speed and was the shape of a sting ray. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.2906;-76.9487
