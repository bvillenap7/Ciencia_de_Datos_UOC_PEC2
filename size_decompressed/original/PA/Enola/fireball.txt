Bright orange and white fireballs;1995-08-12 21:00:00;10 seconds;Bright orange and white fireballs After reading about the massive sightings over the northeast US involving 2 asteroid-like objects (respectively white and orange) I remembered an incident that I witnessed with my friend who was in her own seperate car.  We were following each other on PA Route 15 along the Susquehanna River when we saw two spiraling fire balls directly above the state capital of Harrisburg.  One was bright orange and the other was bright white both with tails and were descending at 45 degrees intertwining each other as they fell.  We were heading to northern York county for a campout.  After we dropped off my car we traveled together and saw the same glowing orange and white fireballs about 25-30 miles south of the original sighting.  Since then, I've seen hovering orange orbs on several occassions the most startling being a sighting in Tioga County, PA in a remote area near my family's cabin.  The orange orb just appeared as I was leaving my cousin's house across the valley and just sat there stationery for about a minute until it simply dissipated. I've seen military-style flares before and shooting stars and this was neither. Around this time I was experiencing a number of paranormal experiences including ET dreams and visitations.
