Fast-moving cloud-like chevron object;2020-04-01 20:30:00;1 minute;Fast-moving cloud-like chevron object Approximately 2030 on April 1st, 2020 I witnessed what resembled a fast-moving V shaped (boomerang) cloud traveling east to west.  It had no sound or lights.  About three to five minutes later, another similar object appeared and was traveling in the same east to west direction.  This object contained three dim round lights, one in the middle and one at each end.  The moon lit sky was clear at this time with no low-level clouds.;40.2906;-76.9487
