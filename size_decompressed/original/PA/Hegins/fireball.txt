Fireball;2004-09-03 20:20:00;15 min;Fireball On Wed. sept 2, and Thursday Sept 3, 2004.  At first what was seen were flicking lights shaped like an arc behind the cloud then the big balls of orange and red would disappear then re-appear. Each time they appeared they would form into like four or five, come together then separate.  This went on the next night at the same time and did somewhat of the same thing.  Big red and orange balls that would come together then separate.;40.6684;-76.4752
Fireball;2004-09-03 21:20:00;15 minutes;On the night of Sept. 2, 2004 at 8:20 pm.  There was a cloud formation with flickering lights shaped in an arch. Then these fireballs of red and orange in color started to appear.  They would reappear then disappear.  They would come together then separate.  This went on for 15 minutes or longer.  Then the exact same thing happened on Thurs. Sept. 3,2004.  I went outside at the same time and a few minutes later the same thing happened as the night before.  This has not happened since those 2 nights.;40.6684;-76.4752
