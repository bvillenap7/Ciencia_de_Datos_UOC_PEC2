The approximate date of this sighting was April 1975 and lasted for about 17 minutes. I was 13 years old and it occurred while I was watching for our school bus to come. The time was 07:40 and I saw what I thought was a small odd looking plane flying across the large open field southwest of our home. It was first seen at about 2500 Yards distant and only about 600 feet in height but continued to get closer, as the distance decreased I quickly realized this was not any aircraft of our technology. It was a crystal clear morning with no clouds and the sun was low in the east as it hit this object it looked like polished aluminum or stainless steel, it was not real large my best guess as to its size would be about 45-55 feet round but slightly cone shaped it had lights around bottom edge and they were rotating what looked to be in the opposite direction of the crafts rotation.   It came to within 120 yards of our home and then just stopped and hovered over the roof of our next door neighbors home and stayed in that spot for about 7 minutes and that’s when  I called my mom and sister to also watch this object and we all observed it until it decided to leave.  It went straight vertical and went out of sight with no sound of any kind. I look back on this event and to this day can’t understand why not one of us had taken any photos of this thing, we all had cameras but neither my sister, mother nor I thought to grab one and get pictures.  As close as this craft was it should have photographed extremely well.  I often think back and wonder if this thing had us hypnotized in some fashion.
