Floating Craft zooms away as I stop to look at it, weird!;2005-01-07 18:45:00;2 mins;Floating Craft zooms away as I stop to look at it, weird! i was driving south from my home on a road with few houses. I saw some red lights and a white light in the trees ahead of me. As I drove up to these lights they were completely stationary making no noise, and i would say about 100 feet off the ground. I 100% thought these were radio towers or cell towers that someone one put up today. I completely stopped the vehicle and put my window down. As soon as I did this the object made a slight roaring noise and accelerated extremly quick to the north. As it flew north it gained altitude and speed untill I could no longer see it.  It had a steady red light on what I would call the front of the craft, a blinking red light on the tail of the craft and a steady white light on the bottom. I could not see the actual craft or its shape, but the orientation of the lights allowed me to make out front back and bottom.  Truly the oddest experience I have.;41.9597;-80.0036
