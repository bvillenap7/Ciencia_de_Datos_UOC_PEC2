Looked out the window because I seen a bright lite over our neighbor`s house. I said to my son, what do you make of that? And It turned right towards us, the bright lite turned off and I could see a green lite on one side and a red lite on the other side.It was a full moon and we could see it.It's wings were slanted back and two bright white lite's came back on the craft was huge. It flew over the house so we ran out side to see it. It was about one hundred feet over our heads moving very slow, you could see the bottom of the craft, the moon was shining brite and the craft was gray, I could see four or five panels underneath up by the noise. The whole time my son was sayiny you can't hardly even hear it,and this thing is as big as my house.;40.3833;-76.9341
