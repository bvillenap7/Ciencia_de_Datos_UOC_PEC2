Moving point of light over the Meadville/Titusville, PA area.;2013-09-24 19:30:00;10 minutes;Moving point of light over the Meadville/Titusville, PA area About 19:30 my wife, daughter and I were in the field behind our house.  The sky was clear and light blue in the area where I was looking, slightly south of west, just above the tree line, about 20 degrees up from the horizon.  There were two aircraft visible with their contrails bright from the setting sun.  The sun had already dropped below the tree line.  I suddenly noticed what appeared to be a star in the blue sky.  This is the third time I have seen such an object this year and I immediately pointed it out to my family.  We observed that it was moving toward the south at a slow speed.  As it moved, it appeared to move horizontal to the ground, then change direction, climb higher into the sky and slowly get dimmer.  It seemed to hover in place then for a minute or so, appearing just like a star, when I broke visual contact due to a disturbance in the woods.  When I looked back I could not locate the object again.;41.6883;-79.8771
