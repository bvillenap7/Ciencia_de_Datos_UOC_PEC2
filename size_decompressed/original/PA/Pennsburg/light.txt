I was on my back porch and could see it from the sky going down to the land.  I live up on a hill and I am about 2 miles from the main street in town.  It landed somewhere in a field, I suppose, between my house and town.   I don't think it hit anything because I stayed outside for a while a didn't hear any sirens or anything unusual. My backyard looks to the west where the sun goes down.  I have seen 2 other odd hovering balls in the past 2 years but never reported them.
