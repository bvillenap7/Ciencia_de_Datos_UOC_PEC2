Hovering bright light witnessed by a group of Scouts.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:30:00;1 minute;Hovering bright light witnessed by a group of Scouts. We were at a father-son camping trip with the cub scouts near Green Lane, PA. While we were there, all of the scouts and parents witnessed a very bright hovering light in the sky at around 8:30 p.m\.  It looked to be about a mile away and about 100 feet off the ground. There was no noise associated with it.  It was casting a light down like a bright spotlight. It was not a star or planet.  The light then seemed to disappear behind clouds (there was a bright, dissipating mist) however, there were no clouds that night. It was very still and crisp fall light.  Although we tried to explain the light, none of the parents could come up with a reasonable explanation. It could not have been a helicopter, as there were no other blinking lights and there was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.3914;-75.4842
