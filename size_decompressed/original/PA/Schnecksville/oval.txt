I was riding my bike on Hickory Road in Schnecksville. I looked up and to one side and saw a silver oval shaped object not moving from what i saw. The sun was in the other part of the sky and it made it shine at the one part.I stared for about 5 seconds and then rode by some trees and then i looked again and it was gone. The sky today was very clear. No clouds were around the object i saw.;40.6858;-75.6237
