Insect or ufo?;2020-07-28 16:00:00;00:05;Insect or ufo? I was walking in the local park testing a new lens for my micro four thirds Camera, I didn’t see the object in the video until I reviewed it later on. Seems to be a solid disc like object traveling at a high rate of speed, zoomed in it looks like there is another object behind the one that zips across the frame. I’ve seen thousands of insects fly in and out of my video frames, this object appears more solid to me. Insect or Aliens?  Neither would surprise me lol. Video has been emailed to, it is mp4 1080 30p;40.6858;-75.6237
