Flashing light over lime quary;2008-06-01 23:00:00;about 1 minute;Flashing light over lime quary At about 11 p.m. I was in my back yard looking at the stars.  It was a clear, dark night and visibility was excellent.  I noticed a flash of white light, similar in size, and duration to that of an airplane landing light.  Unlike landing lights, however, there was only one light flashing.   A second or two later there was another flash of the white light and I saw that it had traveled further than a conventional aircraft could have.   The light continued to travel West to East for a few more seconds, with the flash of light remaining consistent.  Then, whatever it was turned in what must have been an incredibly small radius (between flashes)and began to travel in the opposite direction. I watched it as it now moved silently from East to West until I lost sight of it beyond a ridge.  The entire event took place in about one minute but I continued to watch for another half an hour, hoping (big time) that it would change directions and come back again.  Unfortunately it didn't. For what it's worth, the flight path of the flashing light/object would have taken it over an active lime quary located between Lemont, and Boasburg PA.;40.8074;-77.8051
