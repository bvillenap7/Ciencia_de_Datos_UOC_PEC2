Pennsylvania: New Wilmington;2002-12-10 18:00:00;23 min;Pennsylvania: New Wilmington I was returning from a meeting at church in my car when I saw three objects in the Western sky.  It appeared that a beam of light came from the vessel.  Two other craft that were traveling close to the ground were following it.  The other craft appeared to be some sort of helicopters but there was no sound either from them or from the lights in the sky.
