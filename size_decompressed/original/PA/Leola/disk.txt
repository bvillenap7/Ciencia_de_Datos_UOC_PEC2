tube to a saucer;2003-07-17 17:15:00;45 seconds;tube to a saucer While we were playing lacrosse outside my house in a field i looked up to catch the ball and noticed a strange flying object in the sky. I pointed this object out to my friend and he also saw it. First it looked like a tube then it turned towards us looking like a disk or saucer high above us. From what we could see it was silver and also reflected the sun back towards us. After turning back and forth a few times it kept flying away from us and vanished.
