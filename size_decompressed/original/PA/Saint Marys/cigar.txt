Cigar shaped object in the sky, hovering, not moving at all.;1971-09-30 07:30:00;3 -5 minutes;Cigar shaped object in the sky, hovering, not moving at all. We were waiting for the school bus to pick us up early one morning. It was a nice sunny day.  While we stood there, one of us said look at that, what is that? ?   We all looked up and off to the North, we all saw a cigar shaped object just sitting in the sky.  It didn't move at all.  It was too high up to see any lights but we all saw it and the shape of it.  After what seemed like a couple minutes, the object shot off so fast we almost didn't see it.  It shot sideways and disappeared.  No one ever talked about it because we didn't think anyone would believe us.  But my sisters and I have talked about it.  We know it was a UFO.

To this day I still wonder what it was. I thought of it as hotdog shaped. It just hovered for seconds and then shot across the sky and gone.
