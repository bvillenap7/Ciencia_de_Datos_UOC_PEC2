Fuzzy disc with satelltes which exploded and emitted sparks;2010-07-21 21:00:00;15 min;Fuzzy disc with satelltes which exploded and emitted sparks I was showing my wife the moon through my telescope at about 9:00pm.  The moon was located in the south,venus was setting to the west.  Showed her venus through the telescope.  Above venus was another star which although rather high in the sky i thought could have been Jupiter.   When i found the object in the telescope, i could not focus on the center disc.  I also noticed several sparks which could have passed for Jupiters moons.  Again i could not focus on the center disc. I showed my wife,claiming it was Jupiter.  One of the sparks was red and one was a pale blue.There appeared to be a haze from the main disc that passed through the sparks.  When i looked again into the eyepiece after about 2 minutes i saw the star explode and emit sparks.  I also saw the sparks tumbling away from the disc.  Before this explosion the only objects in the sky were the moon,venus and the mystery star.After the explosion the star was gone.
