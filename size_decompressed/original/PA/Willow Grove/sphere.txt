Silver sphere seen going in and out of clouds.;2018-06-20 13:15:00;5 minutes;Silver sphere seen going in and out of clouds. After lunch, I stopped to admire the clouds before heading into my office.  That's when I observed a small, silvery sphere floating below a cloud to the northeast.  This sphere rose into the cloud and I momentary lost sight of it but I'm a few seconds it dropped back out of the cloud toward a larger cloud below it.  The sphere then skirted along the edge of this cloud for a bit before dropping into that cloud and disapppearing from view.  During the duration of this sighting 2 commercial airliners also traversed this general area of the sky.;40.1578;-75.1235999999999
