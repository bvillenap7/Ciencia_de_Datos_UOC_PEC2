Huge V shape craft as seen before over mountains in California/Las Vegas.;1991-10-31 18:34:00;5 sec;Huge V shape craft as seen before over mountains in California/Las Vegas. I was out trick or treating on halloween and about four other people said they saw a shooting star. I look up to see it and there is no shooting star. Then I look a little to the left and there is a huge V shape craft with five lights on either side of the V. The research I have done on this craft resembles the one seen over mountains in Las Vegas I belive. If not Las Vegas, they were seen somewhere in California over mountains. The craft I saw was identical to the one if the video of the one over the mountains accept the one I saw was slow moving, then all of the sudden tilted and flew until I could not see it a building was then blocking my move. I know 100% that this was not a known craft. At least the people do not know what it is. Whether it is a government craft or a space craft I will not know for the time being. This was a great experience for me, but will keep me wondering for awhile. Also, this would have been a very clear video if I would have pulled out my camera in time. This was a very quick event. I am hoping to have more experiences like this in my life time.;40.1578;-75.1235999999999
Multiple unidentified objects spotted near military base.;2007-03-02 22:00:00;1 hour(approx);Multiple unidentified objects spotted near military base. I received a report while working at dispatch (NAS Willow Grove) about a large number of objects circling over Elkin's Park area.    No Naval or Airforce flight operations were confirmed.   Report of object were laughed off by Airforce security watch commander.   The objects in flight moved slowly in circular formation.  They would stop and go randomly making no sounds other than whooshing sounds during acceleration or course change.   Lights were described as white emitted from the center and red and blue lights on outer areas of the objects.  One object was described as spider like.;40.1578;-75.1235999999999
