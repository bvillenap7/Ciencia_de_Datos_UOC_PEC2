I was actually inside when I spotted this strange orb/light moving slowly across the sky and I immediately noticed the lack of any blinking, directional or running lights on this craft.  I ran outside to get better look and ruled out satalite as it was actually low in the sky, maybe 1/2 mile up.  It was changing, almost morphing orange/amber/yellow orb as best I can describe and the next thing I noticed was it was absolutely quiet, no motor, no sound at all. Object was traveling North to South at a slow speed in absolute straight line.  As I listened for any sound and tried to get a grip with what I was seeing, the de ep orange burning color turned more yellowish, then disapeared altogther in front of my eyes.  It did not shoot off up / down or other just disapeared.  At that p oint heard a jet sound which made no sense and then spotted a small, private size jet with all the normal lights a plane would have headed South to North as it approached the Wilkes Barre Airport to north of our location.  I witnessed this myself, however 5 minutes later my father walked in the door who had been taking home 2 friends and said to us, you will never believe what we just saw, and described the exact thing I had just seen.  I've always been a believer but this was the first for sure sighting that was something not of this earth.  The technology to make that object move like that and almost change shape/color in front of me...sensing the oncoming jet and going stealth/dark...truely amazing.;41.2384;-74.9332
