Out from behind me in the sky came this object very fast it was bright white and seemed to have a bright red type of exaust with a vapor trail that lasted only for a few seconds. The object sighting only lasted about 3 seconds as i could not see it anymore due to the tree tops heading east. Sketch aviabile;41.2384;-74.9332
