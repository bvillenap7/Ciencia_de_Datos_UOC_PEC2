glowing grey hue within 60 feet of my head above tree tops with no noise or air movement.;2020-03-24 18:00:00;5 seconds;glowing grey hue within 60 feet of my head above tree tops with no noise or air movement. While driving from my house to work, a disc shaped object with a rather high center on top passed about 30 feet above the tree tops and continued on its way.   There were no lights but rather the whole body of the craft was a pale gray color and the body itself seemed to have a glowing hue.  There was no noise and it did not create a wind to move the leaves on the trees though it was moving very fast.    I did not see any type of windows or anything on the bottom, it was smooth.  the center on the top was not a very smooth rise from the circumference. Though the center was much higher there was no spinning of the outer rim.   I saw no moving parts at all.   It was very low to me and I was able to get a very very clear view.  There were aircraft at normal altitudes above the mountains but none right in the area.   I live in the mountains of North East Pennsylvania and it was still light out in good weather conditions.  It was heading Northeast at ! a high rate of speed.   If continuing it would have passed over Milford PA into NY state and then over Vermont into New Hampshire  then the most northern part of Maine.;41.2384;-74.9332
