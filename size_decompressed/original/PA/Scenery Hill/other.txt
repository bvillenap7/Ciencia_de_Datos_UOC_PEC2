Boomerang-shaped object with three lights flying over house.;2014-06-17 00:40:00;7-8 minutes;Boomerang-shaped object with three lights flying over house. My boyfriend and I had been sitting out on our front porch, looking up at the sky I had seen an orange like color that appeared to be a larger star.  As we continued to sit and watch, it gradually got higher and closer.   We continued down our front porch steps and it appeared larger, I ran into the house to get my phone to attempt to take a picture, the lights seemed to be too dim to be able to see.   There were three lights on the object, one larger orange light, and two smaller red lights on the sides.  Just the two red lights were flashing.   The sky was quite foggy around it.  It seemed to be boomerang shaped.  It was smaller than a plane, and not the correct shape, nor sound to be a helicopter.   It was flying way too low to be a plane, which is what struck me.  It continued over near our house taking sharp turns, and out of sight within 30 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with one of the two witnesses, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  They are sure that the object was not the International Space Station.  PD));40.0874;-80.0656
