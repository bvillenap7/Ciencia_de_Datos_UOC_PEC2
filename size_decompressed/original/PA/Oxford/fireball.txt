Red lights in complete straight line same distance away from each other  40-60 of them not far from tree top.;2013-09-28 21:30:00;15-30 minutes;Red lights in complete straight line same distance away from each other  40-60 of them not far from tree top. Me and my father were heading down the road maybe 100ft away from the drive way when we saw red lights not to far from the tops of the trees they were equal distant away from each other and going the same speed.  We then headed down and parked in the yard and got out the ones we saw up the street vanished but many more started to appear from the skyline above the trees they just kept coming about 6 at a time, at the end we might have seen about 40 to 50 of them.  (I didn't believe anything like UFOs before I seen this it was literally mind blowing ).  They all have seemed to be going north/north west.  This was going on for about 15-30 mins.;39.78;-75.9856
