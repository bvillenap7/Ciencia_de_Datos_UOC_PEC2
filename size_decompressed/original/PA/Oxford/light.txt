Very bright gold hovering light;2021-02-20 21:00:00;60 seconds;Very bright gold hovering light Very large bright light in the sky. Right outside my house, I’m very familiar with the night sky and what stars are out. This was a large , bright gold light just hovering low in the sky. I live in the country on a back road. Not much light pollution. It hovered in the sky for 45-60 seconds. I got cold and stepped in real quick to get a hat and when I returned outside, it was gone. It appeared several hundred yards up in the sky. One interesting thing that probably has no connection is that I had uncontrollable shivering as soon as I stepped outside. I had a heavy winter jacket and shoes on. I’m a healthy person and love the cold but as soon as I stepped outside and noticed the glowing light and shook uncontrollably, to the point I had to go inside and grab a hat. It felt forced upon me.Very  Strange .;39.78;-75.9856
