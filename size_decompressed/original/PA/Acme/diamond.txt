Low Level Diamond shaped Object Reported;2001-04-04 21:30:00;8 seconds;Low Level Diamond shaped Object Reported The witness and husband were watching tv. The husband stated that he saw a light which appeared low in the woods behind the house. The wife went into the kitchen where she could get a better look but saw nothing. She then went into the living room, and opened the sliding glass door which exits to the back of the house. Within seconds of opening the doors, a large diamond shaped object appeared from over the house, and continued to move as it passed over the trees in the back woods. The object moved fast and steadily, as it passed about 150 feet overhead. The object was observed for about 8 seconds, when it suddenly seemed to vanish above the tree line. The object which was viewd from underneath, was described as a large solidly outlined diamond shaped object which made a humming sound as it passed over. At each corner, there was a dim white non-blinking light. In the bottom center of the object, was a flat red non-blinking light. Immediately after the sighting, the witness and her husband drove towards the area where the object had disappeared, but nothing was seen. The witness reported feeling nervous and could not sleep well for a couple of days after the incident. The witness also mentioned that every night for a month prior to the sighting, she had been feeding several raccoons which came from the woods. The night of the sighting was the first night which they did not appear, however they did return the next evening. I interviewed the witness the day after the sighting. This family wishes to remain anonymous.
