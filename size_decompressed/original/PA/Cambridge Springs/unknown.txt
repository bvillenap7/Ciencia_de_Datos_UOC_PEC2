Moving North/Northeasterly I observed an object that was below clouds moving slowly and made no noise.  It took about 2 minutes to cross the visible sky from the point in which I saw it.  I wondered if it was a satellite, but it was below the clouds.   It had no flashing lights and at one point moved so slow that I thought it was almost hovering. I`m guessing between 3-5 thousand feet but was definitely below the clouds.;41.8057;-80.0597
