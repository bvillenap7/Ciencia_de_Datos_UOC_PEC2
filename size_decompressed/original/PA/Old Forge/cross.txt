Completely silent winged object that disappeared.;2018-04-21 11:00:00;1 minute;Completely silent winged object that disappeared. The weather was mostly sunny, few clouds in the clear blue sky. A yellow colour completely silent object, in the shape of a bird or conventional monoplane. Rough guess, but flew as high as a propeller plane. Flew in a straight line for maybe 12 seconds, then began to waver side to side. It then began to spiral downwards and disappeared into the clear blue sky.;41.368;-75.7341
