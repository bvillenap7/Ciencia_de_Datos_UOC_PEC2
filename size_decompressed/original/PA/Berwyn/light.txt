Light in the sky that I have never seen before.;2014-05-24 23:00:00;2 minutes;Light in the sky that I have never seen before. Light was hovering in the sky right above my head....thought it was a satellite at first but it wasn't moving.  It was too bright to be a star.  I watched it for about 90 seconds before it just burned out.  Never saw anything like that before...very strange!;40.0618;-75.4461
