Large flaming ember double orb crossed the Berwyn, PA sky followed by 4 smaller orbs.;2014-06-08 22:16:00;5+ minutes;Large flaming ember double orb crossed the Berwyn, PA sky followed by 4 smaller orbs.. On Sunday, June 9th, I walked out my front door at about 10:16 PM, and immediately saw something the likes of which I have never witnessed before.  Two objects that looked like they were on fire were moving toward my location (south to north) in the sky.   The front one was the larger of the two and looked segmented - a bit like a large and a small orb joined together, and the second was quite a bit smaller and was a single orb.  The front one had a red and orange glow like fireplace embers, although it was a constant glow and didn't change.  I believe the second one was more orange.   I yelled into the house for my wife and son to come see this â€“ quick!!  Within 15 or 20 seconds my wife came out the door and saw them, and said something about fire.  My son's girlfriend came out and saw part of the show, but I'm not sure how much.  My son came out only after it was all over.   The front orb proceeded at a relatively low altitude straight over my house and went out of range still fully visible.  I realized afterwards that I never heard a sound of any sort emanating from it.   The second one suddenly blinked out.  The way it disappeared caused the wife to say that maybe it had gone into the clouds (it was totally overcast and there was a low ceiling).   Then she said look - there's another.  And I looked back to the location of the first sighting, and there were now three of the smaller orbs coming toward us on the same path.   However, one after the other they blinked out just like the initial small orb had done.  All in all the show may have lasted 5 minutes or a bit more.   I had been on my way to bed, but the wife kept looking periodically during the night and didn't see any more.;40.0618;-75.4461
