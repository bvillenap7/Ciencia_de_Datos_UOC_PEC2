We were standing outside to look at our friends Corvette, when I noticed and pointed out an object in the sky.  It appeared from behind the tree line, like an orange glowing sphere.  It continued to come closer and appeared to stager but was continuing on a path of some sort.  It then seemed to get farther away and higher up at a steady pace until it flew out of sight behind the tree line.  It appeared to travel across the night sky about the speed and pace of an airliner taking about 2 minutes.  Three of us attempted to photograph this with our phones, but the photos came out black.;40.6689;-80.4187
