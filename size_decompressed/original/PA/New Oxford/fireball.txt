Large, bright orange fireball after sunset in sky.;2017-07-20 20:52:00;16 seconds;Large, bright orange fireball after sunset in sky My location:  Route 94 heading north,  Hamilton Twp,, Adams County, Pennsylvania 39.889562, 77.041664    While driving, I saw a bright orange sphere that looked like a setting sun but he sun set at 8:32pm. It was at 350 degrees azimuth and 30 degrees elevation. At arm's length, it was ¾” in diameter.  While driving, I saw it for 10 seconds, before losing it behind a hill, then again for 3 seconds before losing it again.  After cresting the next hill, it was gone.  I could not tell if it was moving.   The skies were mostly cloudy, so it may have gone behind a cloud, or been stationary and a cloud moved in front of it. I was not drinking or on medication, and am of sound mind.;39.8741;-77.0673
