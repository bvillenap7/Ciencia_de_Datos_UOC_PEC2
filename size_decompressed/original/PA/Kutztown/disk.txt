During the night, I decided to step outside for some fresh air and when I opened the front door, I saw a saucer/disk shaped flying object hoverind still apprx 100-200'above or close to trees.  It was a clear night and I could see it perfectly.  It was close to orange color and no other lights were visible  just that color looking like the moon when it sometimes looks orange. After a quick observation, I went back inside to get my camera to take a picture and I grabbed one quickly.  I was about to take the picture and all of a sudden in shot straight up into outer space in less than 5 seconds.  No sounds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.5201;-75.7768
