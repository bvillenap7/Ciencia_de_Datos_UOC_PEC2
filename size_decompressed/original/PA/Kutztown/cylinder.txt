Looked to be the size of a midsize sedan. It moved at speeds no man-made aircraft including drones, move to my knowledge. It increased and decreased altitude in a split second, hovered in place and went from one end of the horizon to the other several times before vanishing. No sound was observed from the object. No exhaust trail was seen. It was near the newer Sheetz in Kutztown. I believe it was just before the construction of the route 222 roundabout that is there now.;40.5201;-75.7768
