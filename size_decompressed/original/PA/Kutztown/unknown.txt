Three orbs in Kutztown, gone within seconds.;2012-11-09 01:00:00;30-40 seconds;Three orbs in Kutztown, gone within seconds. On Friday night I was at my friend’s house in Kutztown just hanging out. Another one of my friends asked if I wanted to go outside to talk for a little, I said sure and we went outside.  About a minute later for some reason I looked directly overhead in the sky and something caught my eye.  At first I thought it was a shooting star because of the color and movement, but then I noticed there were 3 of these orange orbs gliding overhead.  I didn’t know what to make of it and I quickly yelled to my friend to look up and he witnessed the exact same thing.  Three orange orbs then proceeded to almost sort of zig-zag/shake in a formation and then took off at an incredible speed.   I have always wanted to see something like this and I was in complete shock after seeing this.  It was hard to tell if these orbs were one solid craft or three independent things because of the maneuvers it did.  From being directly overhead for about 10 seconds it shot off and was gone and out o! f view over the horizon within 5 seconds.   We also heard helicopter noises that were not far behind, seemed like they were nowhere near it.   What made this even weirder was a few days after I went on your National UFO reporting website and saw that many people have been seeing the same exact objects.  I have never seen anything like this in my life and it really changed how I think about things. Thanks for listening.;40.5201;-75.7768
