LIGHTS IN WOODS.;2015-08-01 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;LIGHTS IN WOODS. On Saturday evening, August 1, 2015, at approximately 9:30 pm, I was standing on my deck in the rear of my house and noticed a small light in the woods.  In the area where I saw the light, there are no houses or structures, and the mountain that I live on drops off back in that area.  There were no sounds or noises and the motion detector lights on my home stayed on the entire time.   I watched the light for approximately 2 to 3 minutes then went into the house and got a family member to come out and watch it also.  We watched the light as it got larger and appeared to come toward us.  We both went back into the house and I called 911 from my cell phone to report the light.  We were watching the light through the kitchen door window and it just disappeared.  After a few minutes we went back out and saw the light again.  This time the light seemed different, but I canâ€™t explain it.   Then the light became two lights, then into several lights.  The lights then combined back i! nto one light and then dimmed out to nothing.  I filmed this with my cell phone as well.  The copy is not as clear the original on my cell phone.;41.361;-76.0403
