Now, my boat is a 40 h.p. runabout and we’ve managed to work our way about 5 miles east from Sheidy Boat Ramp where we put in.   Well it got dark around 20:00 and we wanted to head home because it was a school night.  So it was extremely dark outside with clear skies.  It was so clear that we used the hills around the lake which contrasted the stars to navigate where we were going in the dark.   We were about halfway back traveling down the channel and my brother and my friend were sitting in the back of the boat facing backwards from me spotting for logs and hills with the flashlight.  I was driving looking ahead when I see this saucer like thing with red and white lights come around the corner from the channel we’re on and head straight towards my boat.   I immediately lay off the throttle of the boat and stop in the middle of t! he channel.  My brother and friend have no clue what’s going on because I was stopping and going the whole way back to see where we were going.  They didn’t know I stopped because of this.  Well this object flew down this mile long section of the channel about 100 feet above the water in the blink of my eye until it was just ahead of the boat.  It stopped in midflight and zigzagged in place 2 or 3 times then shot straight up into the sky right in front of me.   By the time it took me to register what just happened and say something to my brother and friend it was too late.   That’s what I saw this night we went fishing at Blue Marsh Lake.
