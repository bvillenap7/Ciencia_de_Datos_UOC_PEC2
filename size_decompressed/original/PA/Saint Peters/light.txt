Soon I saw more, all coming from the NNW moving to the SSE. The size and brightness of all were consistent the origin on the horizon was also consistent but the later 3 or 4 moved more toward due south than the first.   From the time I first noticed them to when they stopped coming was about 10 minutes and at least 18 were seen.   They came in random numbers, sometimes 2 or 3 in close procession and sometimes 1 at a time.  There was no sound associated with the lights they traveled faster than the common aircraft I see in my neighborhood (at cruising altitude) but it was not possible to estimate their altitude.   I estimate about 45 to 50 seconds from when they appeared on the northern horizon to when they disappeared into cloud cover or otherwise vanished at about 40 degrees above the southern horizon.;40.1882;-75.7308
