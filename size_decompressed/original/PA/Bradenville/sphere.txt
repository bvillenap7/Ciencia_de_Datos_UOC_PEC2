We saw a green ball of fire that looked to be a foot maybe 2 feet in circumference about 300 feet above us and fall till it was about 150 feet above us in a diagonal direction.  the green ball just seem to disappear after that, there was no sound of an explosion at all. we have all seen meteor showers and such and this was nothing like it.;40.3253;-79.3399
