I was walking home through a park and the moon was pretty bright approx 65-75% illuminated which was the reason I was able to see the craft above the town the moonlight sort of glistened off it. It was hovering well above the treeline silent it was stark black round but most definitely a solid nuts and bolts craft. I took video and pictures from the park to my house a couple blocks away and kept filming at my house. I also went inside after one and a half hours and got two family members to come out and view the crafter continued to watch for another hour or so the craft still same spot silently hovering however there were periods where it would begin a pulsating of a variety of colored lights. Around 3:00 am I took my family members inside when I came back out the craft was gone. My guess on size is 22 ft approximate height 2,000 ft maybe less.;40.781;-76.2300999999999
