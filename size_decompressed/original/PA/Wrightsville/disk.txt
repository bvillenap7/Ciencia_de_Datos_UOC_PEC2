There was a black storm cloud coming that I was looking at, when 6-8 saucer-like objects suddenly appeared.   They had bright orange lights and seemed to be flying just ahead of the storm.  They did not fly like normal aircraft and some flew against the wind, so weather balloons or something similar seems unlikely.  I ran outside and was able to spot 2 more, which I pointed out to my neighbor.   She told me she saw 2 craft identical to these 4/5 days ago, flying right in front of a storm.;39.9966;-76.527
