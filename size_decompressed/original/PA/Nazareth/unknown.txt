I am just a teenager who often looks up at the stars.  I can identify many constellations and also planets that are in the sky.   On the night of August 16, 2012, around 9:05 pm, I was putting the recycling cans out for the next day.   I had multiple cans to put out so I made two trips.  On the first trip out I noticed an unusually bright object in the ESE sky.   At first I thought that the object might be a planet such as Venus but it was much larger and much, much brighter than anything I had ever seen in the sky before.  It seemed to be glowing.   It was fairly low, perhaps fifteen degrees above the horizon.   I stared at it for at least fifteen seconds to see if it was moving or not, to see if it was an airplane, but it did not move at all.   I immediately thought to go get my binoculars to get a closer look but first I went back into my garage to get the next recycling can.   When I returned to the end of my driveway, so I could see around a tree that blocks th! e view from the house, the object was gone.   No signs of it were around anywhere.  I immediately went inside to alert my mom and grab a pair of binoculars.   We returned outside but there was still nothing.;40.745;-75.3199
