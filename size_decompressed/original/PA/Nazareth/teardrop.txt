Cant explain While on 512 near country junction store, me and my friend seen what appeared to be the start of a contrail.  I told him to take pictures with my HTC one.  He did, the cloud persisted till I took him home about 5 miles from initial observation. After I dropped him off at his house in upper Nazareth I then stopped at the end of his road and took four or five more pictures.  I then preceded to drive to my house to grab my digital camera.  I snapped about 20 photos and took a high definition video without a tripod.  Rookie mistake, but during one part of the video I shook the camera and at that instant the teardrop shape craft which came from the end of this weird long cloud shot up.  A day later at my friends auto repair shop I took a picture of black streaks across the sky.  During this and analysis I noticed a face of what seems to be an E.T. in the background.   Here is a link to my YouTube video of the incident I still have all photos and videos on file upon request I will send them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mUsdmS2gG8&feature=youtube_gdata_player;40.745;-75.3199
