Right away I saw 4 shooting stars so I got a chair and sat down. I noticed a very brite star. The light coming off of it with the stars around made it so I could see all around it. I could see a shape like the edge of a disc or cigar with the light in the middle. I could also see it was gray. I focused on it trying to figure out what it was when I realized it was moving. It was moving slow in a jerking motion,then it went fast and stopped.  I questioned myself if I was seeing it move when it turned around to come back. It made like a square U to come back. It was over me again.  It started to do the slow jerking motion going a few feet to the left then went in reverse to where it started. It did the same to the right. After it went slow in a circle and back and forth it stood still. I tried to get pics and video but I only had my cell phone. After 5 minutes it went slow in a line then picked up speed and went over the mountain    behind me. I drove to go around the mountain but never saw it again  Summary No doubt what I saw over me;40.745;-75.3199
