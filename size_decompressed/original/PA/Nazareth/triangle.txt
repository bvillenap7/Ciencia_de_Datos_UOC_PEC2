Massive Triangle UFO Making a LOT of SOUND that shakes the windows;2005-08-20 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Massive Triangle UFO Making a LOT of SOUND that shakes the windows I was with my family in the living room when I heard what sounded like a plane passing over.  However, the sound was so loud it was shaking the windows of my house.  So, I went outside to see what it was, and I saw this massively large triangle shaped aircraft flying over my house.  There were multicolored lights on the bottom scattered across the entire aircraft.  The brightness of the lights was probably as bright as the red lights from a plane or helicopter after it blinks.  There were no lights on the top, sides, or back.  The size was at least 5 times, most likely larger, than the shape of a plane flying low over my house.  I live in multiple airplane highways, so I know what the planes and helicopters look like when they are high and low to the ground, and I know the paths they take.  This was not following a flight path that I am familiar with, and I lived in that house for over 10 years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
