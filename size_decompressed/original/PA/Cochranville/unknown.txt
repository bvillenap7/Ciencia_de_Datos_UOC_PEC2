Large unidentified drone-like craft with blinking lights in 19330;2020-09-15 21:03:00;15 minutes;Large unidentified drone-like craft with blinking lights in 19330 My wife and I witnessed an unidentified aircraft in zip code 19330.   It was hovering approx. 800-1000 ft off the ground for approx. 3-5 minutes.   My wife saw it doing a slow circular motion before I got outside.   While we both watched, it traveled at a very slow speed, about 5mph in a very direct manner.   When the craft was closest to us, we could hear a very quiet humming as if it was an efficient high powered fan.   The craft had the lights which were blinking.    The craft appeared to be about the size of a bi-plane or larger though we couldn't see the outline in the dark.  It is our belief that this was a drone of some sort, but it was quite large and unidentified.;39.8768;-75.9277
