I saw a brilliant and bright, bluish-green object crossing the sky on a southeast to northwest direction.;2009-12-12 17:50:00;10 sec;My family and were driving north on PA Route 10 approaching PA route 41, when I saw a brilliant and bright, bluish-green object crossing the sky on a southeast to northwest direction.  It was streaking towards the horizon as if falling, but it had a parabolic course.   At first I thought it was a meteor or comet, but the speed was much slower than that of the usual shooting star and was much larger: perhaps five times as large as the normal meteor that I have ever seen.   I pointed to it to show my wife who was in the front passenger seat and she had time to find it in the sky and was also astounded by its color.   As it got closer to the horizon, its tail turned a yellowish-white color and then it slowed down and the simply disappeared. Our first thoughts were that it was a plane crashing, but we saw no explosion it just vanished. We heard no sound and no residue coming from the location of the object. We continued to look for more objects, but none were seen. I am a detailed observer having been a police officer for over twenty years.  I notice many things and have only seen unexplained things a handful of times in my life.  This was quite stunning to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Similar report from two young women in Gray, Maine.  We are awaiting their written report.  PD));39.8768;-75.9277
