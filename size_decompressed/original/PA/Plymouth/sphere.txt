Sighted first object moving in a clockwise circular motion in and out of a dark cloud bank at approx. 3000 feet. object white in color. I went outside to get a better look and spotted the 2nd object it was identical to the first, and moving in the same pattern as the first object. Saw both objects in the eastern sky. I watched them for approx. 5 minutes when both of them simultaniously began to move in a northeasterly direction and behind another cloud bank and out of my view. I contacted a local T V station meteorologist and he verified the altitude of the cloud bank. No other sightings were reported. The objects were noiseless. They were both the size of a dime held at arm's length.;41.2376;-75.9477
Sphere shaped object very similar to a star very close to it, only larger and brighter.;2005-09-29 21:30:00;7;Sphere shaped object very similar to a star very close to it, only larger and brighter. A sphere that looked exactly like the star next to it only slightly larger. Was in the eastern sky moving what appeared to be straight up. The sphere faded 3 or 4 times until it dissolved and faded into the unknown distance.  PS IT WAS CRAZY!;41.2376;-75.9477

Eastern Standard time I witnessed a bright orange sphere that I mistook first for a star, moving in a Northeast direction.  There were no flashing lights attached as would have been on an airplane and no sound to accompany it.  It moved steadily and was very bright.  I was sitting in a dark room looking out the window when the object came in to view from a Southwest direction and I watched the object until it passed from my view.  I watch the skies at night, as I enjoy stargazing and have seen satelites and meteors (shooting stars) pass by in the sky and this looked like nothing I have ever seen before.  The object looked to be the color of an orange flame and stayed steady but strongly resembled a star.;41.2376;-75.9477
