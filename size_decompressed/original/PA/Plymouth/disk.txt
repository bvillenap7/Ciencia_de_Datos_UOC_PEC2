This is an updated report for sighting that occurred on 12/07/03;2003-12-07 15:55:00;5 minutes;This is an updated report for sighting that occurred on 12/07/03 At this time I would like to update my 12/07/03 UFO report, due to the fact I had a week to run the event through my mind.There are a few facts that were not included in my initial report.When I obrerved the first object move into the cloud I saw it emerge into a clear portion of the sky. It was then I noticed the ufo appeared to be dark in color, indicating to me the ufo was made of a hihgly reflective material.It was also more of a disk shape rather than a sphere.This sighting took place in broad daylight just before sunset and when it moved in front of the cloud it appeared to be white in color.The 2nd object appeared white in color at all times for the duration of the sighting.The clouds were moving rapidly from Northeast to Southwest. This is a rough estimate of direction.Winds were approx. 10 MPH. The objects moved AGAINST the wind. Indicating to me they were not kites and not an elaborate hoax.Both of these objects seemed to defy the laws of aerodynamics as I understand them.Please contact me A.S.A.P. via e-mail. Thanks in advance.;41.2376;-75.9477
