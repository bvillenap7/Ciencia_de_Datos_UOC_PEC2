Bright object with flashing red/blue lights on either side spotted over Pennsylvania;2019-02-02 18:30:00;12 minutes;Bright object with flashing red/blue lights on either side spotted over Pennsylvania I went to the store to buy something, and on the way I spotted a strange looking star in the sky.  I noticed that it was much brighter than the other stars and had very dim blue and red flashing lights on the sides.  It was stationary. I bought my item from the store and when I went back outside it was in the same spot.  I recorded it on my phone, noting that if it was a star it was the only one appearing on my phone's camera. I showed it to my mother and brother, who didn't really think much of it.;40.4074;-79.1424
