A silent, fast moving, rectangular object with two large, light-orange lights (not flashing) passed at a constant speed north across the sky - smooth through cloud cover at about 4x the speed of normal aircraft in the area.  The lights appeared to be at the front and back end of the craft, more diamond or square shaped than round lights, with a soft, even glow.  The body of the craft was faint.  It was completely silent in a quiet Sunday evening sky.  I was on the back patio, talking on the phone.;40.973;-76.9117000000001
