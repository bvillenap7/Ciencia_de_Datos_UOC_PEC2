I was sitting at this computer in my house and a glinting in the sky caught my attention. I looked up and I saw a shiny-grayish object that I assumed was a plane until I realized how incredibly fast it was moving, and looked closer to see that it looked like a teardrop on its side.  It was heading from east to west at speeds I have never seen before.  Shortly before moving over the horizon and out of my sight, it made a sharp turn towards the north, sped up even more, and went over the horizon.  My home is in a small rural town in central Pennsylvania, and about 5-7 miles from the main parts of town, and there are no military installations near our area. There are passenger jets visible that pass over our area from time to time like normal, but never anything like this.;40.973;-76.9117000000001
