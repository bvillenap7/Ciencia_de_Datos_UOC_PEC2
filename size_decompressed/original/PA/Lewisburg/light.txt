Plane collides with ball of light;1990-06-01 05:00:00;5 minutes;Plane collides with ball of light Was woken up by a noise like a plane.  Looked out my window, which I slept by in the summer to see a dot of line moving across the sky.  Movement was slow at times, then it would speed up and move in a different dirrection.  I remember becoming very scared and not knowing what was going on.  I then saw what appeared to be a plane, had all the proper flashing lights on it, and I could hear the roar of the engines, heading toward this other ball of light.  As the two got closer, the light became brighter.  Eventually the two seemingly ran into each other, there was a bright flash, all white.  And the dot of light just kept on moving across the sky.  I had checked the papers but there were no reports of a downed plane or a crash. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.973;-76.9117000000001
Bright light chased by helicopter;1991-08-01 03:00:00;2 minutes;Bright light chased by helicopter Was woken up in the middle of the night by a very bright light outside of my window.  I remember looking out and not able to see anything but light, it was so bright that it hurt my eyes to look at it, but I had to look at it.  For about a minute this went on until I heard the sound of a helicopter.  The light then quickly darkened, but I was still able to see a small dot of light, and watched as this light went upwards as the helicopter flew over the house.  My eyes were too sensitive from the brightness for me to see anything else after that as the light moved further away.  The helicopter had only a blinking red light on it, no white lights.  Before the helicopter came there was no sound being made by wherever the light was coming from. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.973;-76.9117000000001
Large bright white steady lights low on horizon over Lewisburg PA;2008-09-02 20:08:00;15 seconds;Large bright white steady lights low on horizon over Lewisburg PA My husband (PhD psychologist/professor) and I sitting at computer next to window on second floor of our house, looking NW.  Rim of orange along horizon as sun just set.   Spotted two (one?) extremely bright WHITE lights, very close together,  10 - 15 degrees above horizon flying from  NNW heading SE.   At first thought it was airplane lived here 13 yrs and we have many in local sky.   But lights very unusual in flight path in direction and altitude, and size (much larger than planesâ€™ lights), and NO noise and lights were very steady, not blinking at all.   Observed 15 secs appr then light/s suddenly blinked out, with no sound and we looked but saw no trace of lights whatsoever.   About 30 seconds later, heard and then saw a small one-engine aircraft with regular blinking green and red lights heading W but flying at a higher altitude and an angle almost perpendicular to original bright white lights.;40.973;-76.9117000000001
