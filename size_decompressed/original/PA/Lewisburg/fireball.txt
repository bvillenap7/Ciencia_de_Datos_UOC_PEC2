Saw unexplained fireball in PA on New Years eve;2010-12-31 23:00:00;4 minutes;Saw unexplained fireball in PA on New Years eve I took the dog out back in our yard when an object to the east caught my attention.  The object was round in shape with the top 2/3 rd. being bright red in color.  The bottom 1/3 rd was bright orange. I would guestimate the object to be at around 18,000 feet in altitude.  It traveled from east to west where I observed it for about two minutes. It traveled at a medium and steady speed.  The object then came to a complete stop for about 20 seconds and then changed direction and headed north.  I watched it for about another minute until it went behind some clouds and that ended my sighting.  The object was silent and made no sound at all.  If you would hold a basketball at arms length,  this would be the size of the object from my vantage point.  The object was about 500 yards away and at a 50 degree angle to the ground.  First time in 62 years I saw an object that I couldn't explain in the sky!;40.973;-76.9117000000001
