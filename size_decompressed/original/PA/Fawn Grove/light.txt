While walking home one night i seen a hovering light that pulsated, i stopped and it stopped, i then started to walk and it seemed to counter my moves, When i walked it would move when i would stop it would stop. I then ran as fast as i could to a shed nearby and climbed ontop. I then looked around and saw no such light. It seemed to have dissapered.;39.7511;-76.4406
