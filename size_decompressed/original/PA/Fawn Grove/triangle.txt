I noticed a dark object in the sky a great distance away.  I didnâ€™t think much of it because we see a lot of air traffic, Commercial, military and private aircrafts including hot air balloons.  The object was traveling north west.  As it approached closer, I could see that it was actually five aircrafts of sort flying in formation.   They were now maybe a quarter mile away.  I could see clearly, five triangle shaped crafts.  Now maybe a thousand yards away, they stopped in mid air for approximately 10 to 15 seconds.  In an instant, one at a time made a hard flat turn towards the south west, even closer now, a few hundred yards above me, I could not see any markings, lights, windows, doors.  Five perfect shaped triangles.   I could not see any type of exhaust trail, nor did they make any noise, not a sound. They traveled  to the south west for about a hundred yards, then made a hard flat turn back towards the north west leaving my view of them with great acceleration.  I was amazed and impressed with what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.7511;-76.4406
