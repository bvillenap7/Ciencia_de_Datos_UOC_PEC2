Sleath Blimp sighted in Pa,;1982-06-01 01:00:00;30 seconds;Sleath Blimp sighted in Pa, I was watching a show called TRV â€” UFO Over Illinois. During this broadcast they shown an artist concept drawing of a stealth Blimp.   I believe this is the object a friend and I saw returning home from a concert in Hershey, Pa.  The object was about one hundred feet above the ground moving about 70 to 80 miles an hour, traveling west in the direction of Harrisburg, Pa. above Route 283. I have no guess on the size of the object.  The object was oval in shape with a row of square windows along edges on each side. There were two slowly rotating discs the three red lights like flourescent tubes forming a triangle in the center of each disc on the rear of the object.  My friend and I were almost directly under the object as we pulled over to watch this through the windsheild of the car.  We were tired and we were drinking.  Seeing that drawing made me want to find out more about this object and to find out if anyone else has seen something like it. Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.2616;-76.6468
