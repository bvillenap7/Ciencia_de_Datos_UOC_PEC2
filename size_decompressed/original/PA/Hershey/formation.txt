Then all of a sudden it was gone but reappears about 3 seconds later further north.  This time I saw only 3 lights but it moved very fast to already be that much farther north in the sky.  Two guys in a truck in front of me pulled over and as I passed them I saw that they were both looking out of the windshield, meaning, their faces were right up against the window. I know I saw something now, seeing those two guys witness it also.  I never believed in this but I have no choice now.;40.2616;-76.6468
Several bright triangular crafts seen flying in formation over Hershey Park.  ((NUFORC Note:  ((Space Link satellites??  PD));2019-05-26 20:34:00;~1-2 minute;Several bright triangular crafts seen flying in formation over Hershey Park I was on the Kissing Tower ride at Hershey Park (a rotating observatory elevator that rises high) and took a bunch of photos with my phone in quick succession.  I viewed the photos after, and in the direction facing the Hershey factory, two to four shiny objects of an upside down triangular shape could be seen high in the sky that appeared to be flying in formation.  They changed position slightly from shot to shot.  In the last shot they were partially hidden by the clouds.;40.2616;-76.6468
