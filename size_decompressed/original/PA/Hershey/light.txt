Seen while driving . I was driving on the highway and there was a huge flash of light.  The light lit up the entire town, possibly more.   As I looked around for a split second I noticed a very bright ball of light in the sky ahead of.   This light was almost tear dropped.  It was moving downwards at a high rate.   After a couple seconds it disappeared.   My dad inside the house with closed blinds saw this flash of light.   The house is about 2-3 minutes from my location at the time, in a neighborhood with houses all around. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness confirms a nighttime sighting.  We have amended the time above.

At 9pm I witnessed 4 lights that appeared to be a start of a fireworks display. Eating dinner at the Circular restaurant in Hotel Hershey.  At 9 pm I witnessed 4 lights that appeared to be a start of a firework display-however as one light went on-another followed and another and another.  I finally said, What the hell is happening outside? Then all 4 lights shut off and vanished. The next moment 3 aircraft (fighter planes) positioned themselves in a triangular shape to appear as if to corner the suspect lights. As they cornered the lights -nothing was there.  It was as if the fighter planes were chasing air. After about 5 minutes of circling the area, the 3 fighter planes took off.;40.2616;-76.6468
