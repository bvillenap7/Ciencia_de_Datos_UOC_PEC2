Cylinder shaped UFO Shavertown, Pennsylvania;2016-06-30 01:15:00;10 seconds;Cylinder shaped UFO Shavertown Pennsylvania On June 30, 2016 1:15am.  My wife and myself who are both medical professionals and we were stargazing which we do on a regular basis.  We are accustomed to spotting all types of aircraft and satellites.  We observed the enclosed cylinder shaped UFO at approximately 10,000 feet.  The night sky was totally clear with no haze or moonlight showing.  The craft moved silently from the south moving towards the north.  It was moving much faster than any plane or satellite.  It took about 10 seconds to cross our observed night sky.  Both ends of the cylinder appeared illuminated and the center almost appeared translucent.;41.2973;-75.9746
