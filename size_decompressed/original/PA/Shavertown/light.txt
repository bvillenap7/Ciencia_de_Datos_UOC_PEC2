Stationary light in distance;2007-06-09 00:00:00;2 minutes;Stationary light in distance This event occurred after a storm that knocked out all of the lights in the area.  I was leaving a friendâ€™s home with my mother when I noticed an extremely bright light off in the distance. The light was yellow, spherical and stationary.  My mother confirmed the light.  I walked my mother to the car, and when I looked back, the light had disappeared entirely.  This instance was extraordinary in that there were no ordinary lights to be seen anywhere.  Moreover, the cloud cover allowed no other stars to be seen.  The night was exceptionally dark.   When I first saw the object, I believed it to be a star.  However, after further inspection, I believed it to be far too large and far too bright to be an ordinary star.  In addition, I believe that if it had been a star, it would have been shrouded by the cloud cover, and, as a result, would not have been visible at all, or would have been quite dull.  It was apparent that this object was beneath the cloud cover.  Even more, the light seemed to be slightly pulsing. I stood and watched it for about ten seconds. I intended to observe it more, but when I looked back, it was gone. I returned to my vehicle to check whether or not there was any radio interference. There was not.
