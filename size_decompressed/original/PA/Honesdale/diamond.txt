A diamond shaped object flew over baseball field.;2004-07-15 23:45:00;5 min;A diamond shaped object flew over baseball field. My friends and I were sitting in the middle of  a baseball field looking at the stars when we saw a big diamond shaped object start moving across the sky. It was moving a little faster then a plane. It had white lights, then changed to orange lights at each point of the diamond shape. The lights were constant and did not blink. It flew over the field and disapearred behind a treeline. About ten seconds after then shippassed over the treeline, three jets flew over the field very fast.;41.5775;-75.2552
