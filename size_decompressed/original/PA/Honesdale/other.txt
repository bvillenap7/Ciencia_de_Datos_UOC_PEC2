We kept watching as we were driving they moved around then they went into a semi-single verticle line formation, at this time we pulled over and got out of the vehicle and looked up and another car came behind us and they got out and looked also, and one by one they moved out and disappeared,  Not sure what it was but it was something i never saw before.;41.5775;-75.2552
