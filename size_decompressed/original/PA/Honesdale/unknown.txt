Slient craft shines light on me;2006-08-15 10:30:00;30sec;Slient craft shines light on me I was camping with my family and my cousin and I were sitting around the fire when we saw a light in the sky. There was only one light and we could not make out the shape of the craft. It was flying just above the tree line and it made absolutely no noise. The campground is very quite so even the slightest engine rumble would have been detected but I heard nothing. It fly directly above us and as it passed it shined a light down(mabey a spotlight). The light shone directly on me for about two seconds then went immediately over to my cousin. The light was not as bright as a spotlight say from a helicopter. The craft flew away and the light turned off after it flew over us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.5775;-75.2552
