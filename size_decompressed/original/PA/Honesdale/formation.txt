There was no particular formation like triangle or circle, rather they were in a jagged line and maintained that formation for the 5 minutes that we say them pass over head.  No noise, no blinking lights.  Our friend had seen a single orange ball pass over his house 15 minutes earlier.  He lives about 20 miles from us.;41.5775;-75.2552
