Standing in the front yard with my neighbor and this ball of light shoots from over the horizon into the middle of the sky right in front of us and stops.  It was only what seemed to be a few thousand feet high.   Not overly big but intimidating enough.  It was still light out and the ball of light was extremely bright.  We looked at each other and decided quickly to get a camera and as soon as we started to run the ball of light just shot off over the horizon at about 120 degrees and was gone.   The event was less than 30 seconds.    Never heard any reports from any other witnesses.;41.0217;-78.4418
Bright flying light with brightness changes and strange flying pattern.;2020-02-25 02:10:00;5 minutes;Bright flying light with brightness changes and strange flying pattern. Saw a light in the sky we thought, (at first), was just a star.  It was a clear night with lots of stars out.  But then this light started moving.  Making “S” and “zigzag” pattern moments and then abruptly stopping.  While stopped the light would intensify in brightness and then dim again.  Then it flew off behind a tree line and out of sight.  We were amazed by what we saw and couldn’t believe it.  No plane or helicopter could have made those movements and surely was no star.  For the time and location of the area a drone is highly unlikely.;41.0217;-78.4418
