2 Star like objects;2011-03-07 02:45:00;2-3 minutes;I was on Patrol in S.B. Elliot Park for EOG Resources. I went back to the trailer to use the restroom. Usually the area is lit from lights attached to a generator so water trucks can see to pump water into a pond. When I stepped out, I noticed 2 Star like objects moving in the clear sky. They were not blinking, flashing, or anything. They moved in perfect unison and a great speed. They were travelling North North East I believe. I watched them for about 2 min and they disappeared. While this was going on I also noticed a smaller and not as bright one moving pretty fast North west and crossed paths with the two star like objects. I tried to take a picture with my camera phone, but it was too dark. Any feedback appreciated.;41.0217;-78.4418
Star-Like object moving NW to SE;2012-06-21 03:45:00;3-5 min;Star-Like object moving NW to SE This was about 3:40am, I was at work and I took a break from driving around to do some paperwork. I work in the middle of the woods so it was pretty dark out. After I had completed my paperwork I stepped outside the vehicle to stretch my legs. Its about 3:45am now I noticed a flash out of the corner of my eye. I looked up into the sky and I could barely see a star-like object moving from NW to SE towards Clearfield. The object would brighten and then it would appear to flash and then dim out to where you can barely see it. It did this about 5 times before I lost it in the tree line.;41.0217;-78.4418
