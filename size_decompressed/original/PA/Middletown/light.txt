2 orange lights moving in circular motion in the middle of the night;2005-02-06 01:08:00;10-15 seconds;2 orange lights moving in circular motion in the middle of the night I was looking up to the sky in the middle of the night looking at the stars. As I looked up I saw an airplane flying from my left to the right. Just then I saw two orange lights moving in a circular motion glided from my right to my left. It lasted about 10 to 15 seconds. I couldn't be sure because I was standing in awe of what I just saw. The lights were dim or glimmer, not sure which word to use. The lights then faded away.;40.2039;-76.7286
This is the second time I have seen these lights, and just by looking on this website, others are seeing the same thing.;2006-02-15 18:15:00;15 minutes;This is the second time I have seen these lights, and just by looking on this website, others are seeing the same thing.  The first time I saw this formtion was in mid-December.  I live in Lower Swatara Twp. and a vertical line of four lights appeared in the northern sky, probably somewhere in the area of Colonial Park/Linglestown.  They had an orangish color to them, were visible for only about 5 seconds, and then faded out.  They did not reappear.  My wife, who was with me, did not see them.  About 1 week ago, on or about 02/15/06, I again saw this (or a similar) occurrence in the same area of the sky.  This time, however, the display lasted for about 15 minutes.  The lights were the same orangish color, and each formation that I saw would go out after about 5-10 seconds.  A few minutes later, the lights would reappear.  They would be in the exact same area of the sky, but would take on a different formation.  It seemed that one light would turn into two, then three, then four before finally fading out.  This went on for about fifteen minutes.  My wife did see these lights.  Fort Indiantown Gap is is the same general area that I have seen these lights, and they do remind me of some kind of flare.  They just appear to me as lights, and don't appear to be under intelligent control.;40.2039;-76.7286
2 sets of bright lights seen and did not leave area for approximatly 5 minutes.  No sound.  Witnessed by 8 people.;2013-06-29 22:15:00;5 minutes;2 sets of bright lights seen and did not leave area for approximatly 5 minutes.  No sound.  Witnessed by 8 people. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume a nighttime sighting, and we have changed the time above.  PD)) While visiting a relativeâ€™s house, 8 of us were on the back porch.  Something caught my eye.  Everyone looked up and saw the same lights that I had seen.   They were solid lights, no blinking.  It looked like whatever they were attached to turned and you could see 5 lights total.   Then, you could see another 4 lights behind the first set of 5.   After approximately 5 minutes the lights seemed to follow each other to the east and ad they disappeared there was a bright flash.   There was a storm entering out area, so it could have been lightening, but it seemed to be concentrated to the area that the lights were traveling.   We do live near an airport.  But, this was something that none of us had ever seen before.  There was also no noise involved.;40.2039;-76.7286
