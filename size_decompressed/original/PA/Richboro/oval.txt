This went from about 300 ft. to around 10,000 ft. within half a minute. This UFO was visable for a few minutes until it went past the horizon.  Two planes around it were moving very slowly compaired to this object.;40.2214;-74.9974
Yellowish/Orange lights in a formation of a &quotQ&quot Oval shaped then gone in seconds.;2013-10-08 07:15:00;30 seconds;Yellowish/Orange lights in a formation of a Q Oval shaped then gone in seconds. I saw an oval shaped object with lights all around it there were at least six of them.  I immediately said something to my mom she said she saw them too.  I then noticed that they were in a formation they looked as if they were in the shape of a “Q” I was looking east of our car out of the window.  Then I looked back at my mom these figures got a lot brighter then what they were before.  Then they just disappeared, there was not one sign of them.   We spent about ten more minutes looking for them,  They were gone!;40.2214;-74.9974
