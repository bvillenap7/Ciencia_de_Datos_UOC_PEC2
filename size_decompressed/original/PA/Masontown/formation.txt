Orbs become visible as the pass under and by Venus in a formation.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-05 20:00:00;30 minutes;Orbs become visible as the pass under and by Venus in a formation Me and a friend we’re hanging out when I decided to call it a night, I asked him to leave and escorted him out. As I said goodbye and was about to close my door a flash of light caught my eye. I noticed Venus in the west had 2 flying objects passing underneath. I thought they were planes or what not and brushed it off, until I noticed it disappear and reappear in the same flight trajectory. I watched for 10 mins till i got my brothers opinion on if it was a planes or not, I don’t think he seen them cause he was half asleep. It continued as I checked on it till 8:30 then it stopped. I couldn’t count how many but there was, it seemed to stop at a spot and restart where I noticed it the first time. The would stop being visible once they traveled to the Big Dipper;39.8394;-79.895
