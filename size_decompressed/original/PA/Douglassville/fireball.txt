4 orange glowing balls hovering above open field in staggered line formation.;2014-07-12 21:45:00;2+ minutes;4 orange glowing balls hovering above open field in staggered line formation My family and I were driving south on 662 between Oley and Douglasville.   We noticed 4 orange glowing balls, directly over an open corn field.  They were hovering over the field for about 2 minutes before we lost sight of them, and did not move.   They appeared to be about the size of the balls you would typically see on electrical power lines, and they were formed in a staggered line.;40.2659;-75.7346
