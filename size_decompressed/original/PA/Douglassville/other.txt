Sparkling, multi-colored cresent shaped object heading east over Douglassville, Pa;2000-11-08 22:30:00;5 minutes;Sparkling, multi-colored cresent shaped object heading east over Douglassville, Pa The sky was clear, dark, stars were prominent. I was skysurfing and saw a cresent shaped craft heading east while I was facing south-east. The object was about at 1000ft, and appeared to sparkle with multi-colored lights of yellow, blue, red, green and white. It was beautiful. It moved slowly, then turned coming toward me, went in an ark over me, still high, at about 800+ feet. It then turned to the east again, and I watched it until it was out of my field of vision. I could not identify it as anything we have in the air now. It was awsome. My girlfriend and her husband also saw it, and thought it was spectacular.;40.2659;-75.7346
