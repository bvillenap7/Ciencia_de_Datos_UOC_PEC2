THUS, DURING A CLOUDLESS, CLEAR, STARRY NIGHT, WITH VERY LITTLE WIND OR HAZE, WITNESSED A SINGLE GLOWING OBJECT COMING FROM THE SOUTH TOWARDS US, ABOUT 2 MILES AWAY, COMING NORTH, ESTIMATING ABOUT 2000 FEET UP, AND RISING SLOWLY, WHILE DROPPING A FEW SPARKS NOW AND THEN.   IT LOOKED LIKED IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SMALL PLANES ENGINE BURNING SOME SAID, OR LIKE A NEIGHBOR SAID, A POSSIBLE BURNING 'CHINESE LANTERN', RELEASED BY SOMEONE ON THE GROUND.   I TOOK A SNAPSHOT OF IT WITH MY CELL PHONE, BUT IT WAS TOO SMALL TO SEE IT, AND AS I WAS READY TO CALL 9-11 AND REPORT IT,  IT THEN ROSE VERY HIGH IN THE SKY, GETTING VERY SMALL AND JUST VANISHED OUT OF SIGHT.   TWO MINUTES LATER MY SISTER IN LAW YELLED OUT THAT A 'SECOND' LIGHT JUST LIKE THE FIRST ONE WAS ON A SIMILAR PATH AND IT DID THE SAME THING AS THE FIRST.  AS WE ALL WATCHED IN EXCITED AMAZEMENT, AS THIS WAS NO COINCIDENCE WE THOUGHT, AS IT TOO ROSE SLOWLY 'UP' AND BLINKED OUT.   WE ALL SAW A SATELLITE GO BY ,SOUTH TO NORTH VERY HIGH UP.  (MY BROTHER WHO LIVES THERE SEES THEM ALL THE TIME, HE TOLD US),   AS WE ALL WATCHED THE SKY AS A GROUP FROM EVERY DIRECTION.  NOTHING MORE WAS SEEN AND WE TALKED ABOUT PERSONAL OTHER SIGHTING THE REST OF THE EVENING. ...END.;40.2659;-75.7346
