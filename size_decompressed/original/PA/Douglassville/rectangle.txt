4 Blue Lights perfectly spaced in a single row found hovering above night sky for 1 minute in Douglassville, Pa;2012-11-15 18:30:00;1 minute;4 Blue Lights perfectly spaced in a single row found hovering above night sky for 1 minute in Douglassville, Pa At 6:30pm in Douglassville, Pa my two children and I saw 4 bright blue lights perfectly spaced in a single row hovering above us, no movement at all, for around one minute and then the lights just disappeared with no trail.  The sky was pretty black/clear.  I’ve never seen anything like it before. I drove back over to the area where we witnessed it and it was not there, nor did it reappear.  I don’t know if there is any type of aircraft that could possibly have that configuration of neon blue lighting.  If you were to outline the lighting it would form a perfect rectangle.  It could also have been 4 separate hovering UFO’s, but they were spaced too perfect, all 4 lights were equally spaced apart from each other.  There was no sound.;40.2659;-75.7346
