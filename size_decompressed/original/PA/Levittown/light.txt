1 small bright light appeared to be chased by another.;1975-06-15 21:00:00;4-5 seconds;1 small bright light appeared to be chased by another I thought it was about time that  I reported for posterity what I saw over the skies of Levittown PA on a clear summer night around June of 1975 (estimate).  My brother and I had decided to go out on his back lawn and look for shooting stars, as I had never observed one before.  We reclined in chaise lounge chairs and stared up at the sky for quite some time, then I saw a streak of blue/white light travel rapidly across the sky and then vanish.  My brother said “did you see that…that was one”. Shortly after this, in the same area of the sky, I saw another. However this time the streaking light (which vanished) was followed by another pinpoint of white light coming from a higher angle of elevation (as perceived from my position on the ground)on an intersecting course with the trajectory of the first object. It was as if the second light had been chasing the first.  As rapidly as the second light converged on the first, it halted in place hanging there for a second…then executed a 135 degree turn to port, and stopped dead again.  After approximately one second it executed another approx. 135 degree to port side and halted abruptly again, suspended in space. This final maneuver brought the object back to what appeared it’s original course…then vanished.  The light simply disappeared so rapidly that I could not follow it, or it was extinguished. I do wear corrective lenses, so I immediately scanned  the neighbors houses for any lights which could have reflected off my lenses from opening screen -doors or flashlights, or perhaps a cars headlights.  I saw nothing which could have caused such reflections.   I know that these could not have been manned aircraft as the G-Force of such abrupt turns, speeds and dead stops would probably have killed a human being.

Burnt orange objects in clear sky no navigation lights appeared out of nowhere travel across sky then disappeared.  Levittown Pa.;2013-10-20 18:20:00;12 minutes;Burnt orange objects in clear sky no navigation lights appeared out of nowhere travel across sky then disappeared.  Levittown Pa To start I have been a sky watcher for 20 years, observed many meteor showers, fireball, satellite’s traversing post dusk and I am well versed in natural occurring phenomenon.  At 18:20 hrs. while pulling in to the supermarket parking lot at Edgely and New Fall Rd. in Levittown Pa.  I observed a bright burnt orange light in the SSE sky at roughly a 35-degree angle moving at a steady rate of speed from right to left in my field of view.  The color of the object and the fact that there were no navigation lights present caught me as strange.  The light observed appeared to have a slight haze around it.  Its size slowly decreased in size as if it was traveling away to the ENE then disappeared.  As the light vanished a new burnt orange light appeared in the SSE sky.  I took notice of the location as being in the area of a particular star in the sky.  When the second object/light appeared it was bright with a haze around it and took the exact same track at a 35-degree angle moving at a steady rate of speed from right to left in my field of view.  It also appeared to decrease in size as if it was traveling away to the ENE then it to disappeared.  I noted the location of the object/light disappearance by a star in the vicinity.  Again, as the second object/light vanished a third appeared in the exact same spot as the second object/light appeared as if I was watching a recording of the event.  This time I took out my camera phone and videoed the event.  The track was identical, the orientation identical, the color, shape, haze around the object identical, and it disappeared in the identical spot as the previous two objects.

As I was parking in the supermarket parking lot I noticed a orange light that appeared out of nowhere in the sky above the store.;2013-10-20 20:25:00;8 minutes;As I was parking in the supermarket parking lot I noticed a orange light that appeared out of nowhere in the sky above the store.  No navigation light on object.   It traversed the sky appeared to get larger as if it was getting closer then seen to slowly navigate and flickered out.   Then a second orange object appeared at the same location as the first object appeared.  Same color orange (like a burnt orange) took the same path with the same out come, flickered out in the same location in the sky.   Then the third, same color, same identical path, then flickered out.   Each object appeared and disappeared in the same location.  I confirm this by using two stars as my gauge got the location.   Unsure of altitude, unsure of size.  No navigation lights, but appeared and disappeared in a clear starry sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Seen a bright white light roughly the size of a full size truck about a half mile away in the sky fly rapidly right to left.  Following that it almost was as if it knew I was watching and then it stopped and stayed completely still for about 20 seconds.  After that it started dancing and flashing red blue red blue and then back to white.  Then it flew back to the left about 5 miles away in about 5 seconds until it went past the tree line.  All of which with zero sound.;40.1515240963855;-74.8560506024097
