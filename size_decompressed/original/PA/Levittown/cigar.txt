I thought maybe they were planes or helicopters but there was no noise and they absolutely did not move for 20+ minutes.  I did record them on my phone but they were a bit far off.  They were still there when I left because I had to take my daughter to get her school bus.;40.1515240963855;-74.8560506024097
