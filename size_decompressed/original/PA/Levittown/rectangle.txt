I was in the car with my 10 year old daughter. We were heading out to go shopping for a Halloween costume.  The sun was just beginning to set, when we came to a red light, in the residential section of Fairless Hill. As we sat at the red light, a rectangular object flew just above the tree tops, to the right side of our car.  The craft did not seem to make any noise.  It was long, and dark gray in color.  The underneath was completely covered by two, side-by-side rows of about 10 round, white lights.  The lights reminded me of spotlights. I'm not very good at guessing the length or distance of objects, but my best guess would be that it was about 80-100 feet in length, and about 30-40 feet in width.  It was so close to us that we really couldn't tell how tall it was.  We mostly got a view of the underside.  As it began to move away from us, it didn't seem to appear to have much height to it at all. The craft moved at a moderately fast pace, and disappeared behind the tree line across the street very quickly.  My daughter and I both looked up and pointed to the object at the same time, and it was gone that quickly. The traffic light turned green almost immediately, and we traveled in the direction that we saw it disappear behind the trees.  By the time we reached a clearing in the tree line (probably about 100 feet away from the light we were previously at), the craft was so far away that it could only be seen along the distant horizon.  Neither of us could figure out how it could have traveled what looked like several miles, in less than a minute.  Though it was almost out of sight at that point, we were still able to make out it's shape and lights, even from that distance.;40.1515240963855;-74.8560506024097
Large, low-flying boomerang-shaped object moving very slowly over Levittown, PA, 1/20/16.;2016-01-20 18:12:00;5 minutes;Large, low-flying boomerang-shaped object moving very slowly over Levittown, PA, 1/20/16. I viewed what I think might have been a drone in the shape of an airplane.  It was going so slow at one point.  My car passed it on Rte 13 going southbound and it surprised me as my car was going 55 mph and I was pulling away from it at one point as it was traveling southbound as I was.   Then it gained speed and proceeded southbound towards Philadelphia ahead of me.   I later saw the object flying over Penn Valley Rd and headed towards Trenton.  This time I was outside with another person and I could hear that it made noise like a very quiet airplane, but it was much larger than a Piper Cub.  It had red flashing lights at times.  It was weird that it was so low.  Nothing about it appeared extraordinary other than the slow speed at which it traveled next to my car going southbound on Rte 13.
