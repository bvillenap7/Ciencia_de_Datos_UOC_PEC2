Two were near front and one behind a bit.   The third one almost instantly caught up to the other two.   They were flying like in a backward V formation.   The third object emitted sparks from underneath.  Then they made a sideways triangle.   They then reversed their direction instantly and flew in opposite direction.  And then became invisible (possibly entered a cloud).;40.1515240963855;-74.8560506024097
