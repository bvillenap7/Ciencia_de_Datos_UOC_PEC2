Unidentified black oval object in South Eastern Pennsylvania sky disappears;2005-06-26 19:10:00;15 minutes;Unidentified black oval object in South Eastern Pennsylvania sky disappears I was swimming in my back yard pool when I noticed in the Eastern Sky a small dark oval shaped object.  It appeared to be motionless not ascending or descending.  It looked to be about 1 mile away and at an altitude of 5-10,000 feet.  The sky was clear and visibility greater then 7 miles.  My wife and my 6 year old daughter also witnessed the object.  We were watching this for about 10 minutes and then it slowly began to rise higher on the horizon and move to the right behind a tree that is in our back yard.  I could see the object through he tree branches and leaves.  I immediately got out of my pool while my daughter handed me my binoculars and headed to the front of the house.  It didn't take more then 30 seconds to get to the front of the house.  To my surprise I looked up to the East well clear of the tree and couldn't find the object.  I yelled over to my wife who was still in the pool and asked her if she could see the object.  She said she could not.  I looked all over the sky but could not see the object.  Since it was moving at such a slow speed I should of been able to see it once I move to the front of the house and away from the tree.;40.1515240963855;-74.8560506024097
