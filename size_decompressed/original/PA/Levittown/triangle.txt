Low flying, large triangle having fun, playing with us.;1985-08-20 00:00:00;5 min;Low flying, large triangle having fun, playing with us. A few friends and I all around age 15 were hanging out in a neighbors back yard when we noticed a bright light slowly moving in our direction. At first we blew it off as just an airplane.  But, as it got closer we noticed it hadn't been blinking nor did it make a sound (we had seen dozens of planes that night and this was not one).  When it reached us, moving maybe 10 miles an hour (jogging pace) we could see a shape but no real body to it, kind of like a shadow but you could not see through it at all but yet you couldn't see it, if that makes any sense? We noticed it seemed to be following the streets we lived on hovering just above the treetops. Being a football fan I can better measure distance in yardage, and I would say that the craft was flying no more then sixty yards above us and it had a triangle shape that was maybe fifty yards from point to point to point and each point was lit with a large bright white circle but it didn't hurt at all to look at them. The three of us walked and jumped under it yelling and waving at it as it turned down my street.  I ran to my house and woke my mother who came out to see it as it slowly drifted upwards and further down the street until it reached a certain hight, then took off faster then anything I have seen since, making crazy zig zags as it disapeared into the sky. The strange thing about the whole thing is that none of us were frightened of this object.  Infact I had the impression it was playing with us... ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

bright lights in the sky;2004-01-29 18:45:00;20-30 min;i was out driving around with my girlfriend when i noticed bright lights in the sky . i was watching them as i was driving so just so i didnt lose them i pulled into a section where theres a little open feild so i could watch them alittle better.up in the sky was 2 triangle objects with 4 very bright lights on the bottom of both of them. they were so close together i knew they couldnt be airplains. my girlfriend turned down my radio and told me to open my window to see if it made any noise. and it didnt.so we sat there watching it for about 20 min then the one turned enough so where u could see red and green lights along the sides of them. and they started moving slow...;40.1515240963855;-74.8560506024097
My boyfriend and I had spent about 5-6 hrs at his very religious grandparents house down in NE Philly (no drinking that night) and as w;2004-06-02 23:45:00;3-5 min;My boyfriend and I had spent about 5-6 hrs at his very religious grandparents house down in NE Philly (no drinking that night) and as we pulled off of RT1 North onto RT13 S.  I saw a very large cluster of red and white light s off to my left in the sky.  There was no sensible pattern to the blinking of the lights sometimes 5 white and 7 red and then 13 white and 2 red would blink on and off, and not all at the same time.   I told ((name deleted)) to look at it and he said he couldnt because he was driving.  We were about 30 seconds from his development so when we pulled into his neighborhood i leaned out the window and looked above the car and the craft was right over me.   This time from underneath it i could make out it's shape instead of a huge cluster of lights.  It looked like a triangle but along the bottom of the triangle, it was inverted, like someone had cut a triangular peice out of it.  It was so close to the ground if I would have shot at it with a paintball gun i could have hit it and made no noise at all, just a dull humming like when your refrigeator kicks in in the middle of the night.   I could see the outline of what looked like seams in the metal (which was dark) that looked like it had been welded together ( there were little dark dots along the seam).   I am screaming for him to stop the car and look at this thing but he saide we were almost at his treet and to hold on (he's very skeptical).  When he finally parked the car we both jumped out and ooked across the street.   The object moved into view between the rooves of two neighboring houses across the street and then hovered (a little wobbly) for about 25 seconds in the same spot where we both got a great look at it. The lights wre around the outside of it now.   I held up my hands and tried to measure it between the two of them and it was about 6 or 7 inches which means that for as far away as it was, it had to be HUGE to appear that big from my point of perspective.   Then it just glided back out of view behing the houses from the direction it had come from.  We ran down to the end of the street and tried to see it again but by that time it was way off in the distance and just a cluster of randomly pulsating lights.  Needless to say my boyfriend is no longer a skeptic. for some reason it wont let me put the date right. it was june 2 2004 not 1904 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
