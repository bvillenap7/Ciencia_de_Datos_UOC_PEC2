I stood there, briefly (maybe 10 seconds), as I tried to determine if it was something I recognized, like a hot air balloon. No flashing lights. It seemed as if it was not moving at all. Went into my house and got my binoculars and could not identify what it was. Object was perfectly round with brighter areas at top and bottom. Towards the bottom, there was a darker area. These features are noticeable in my photos. I immediately then went and got my Canon 7D camera and put on my largest telescoping lens, 300mm. I just had it serviced at Canon, so I know I could get a good picture. I have 40 pictures showing the features. Time of pictures was from 19:25 to 19:32. After taking most of the pictures, I went and got my neighbor. He looked at it through the binoculars. He also agreed he did not know what it was. We watched it for several minutes. We did notice it was moving really slow. Neighbor went back inside his house to contact someone with a telescope. I walked back to my driveway to use my truck as a prop to take more pictures, (about 10 second walk). I turned around and looked up and the object was gone.;40.0105;-77.1083
