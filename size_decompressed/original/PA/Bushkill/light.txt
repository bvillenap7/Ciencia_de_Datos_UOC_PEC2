The light speed up fast and then followed behind us and then ziped away and was gone.but yet there was no sound.;2008-06-08 19:00:00;20 seconds;The light speed up fast and then followed behind us and then ziped away and was gone.but yet there was no sound. My daughter and I were traveling threw the Shawnee one of the back roads home,when a very bright light was speeding up behind us I was the driver of the vehicle, I then said ''why is this guy traveling so fast and speeding up behind us'',my daughter who was in the car as well then looked back and saw a bright light as well..... I continued to be confused because the very bright round light was in air when I continued to look back and say what the hell is that it zipped away just diapering to our left and was gone in a flash.well you could not make a left turn we were driving threw mountains in the woods when it vanished.My daughter and I were freaked out and didn't know what to think. when we reached home we shared our experience with everybody but they just laughed at us so we never mention it or nor do we discuss it amongst each other,But it never leaves my mind to wonder what was that? what did we see.

One big light pulsating and moving in small, random circles and one small light staying still but slowly blinking.;2013-12-20 20:40:00;50-60 minutes;One big light pulsating and moving in small, random circles and one small light staying still but slowly blinking i was watching tv when a helicopter caught my eye through the window, then i noticed above the passing copter, a giant star-like light radiating in and out of visibility.  i ignored it until 5min later when i went to get more tea, i looked out my kitchen window and it was still there. i sat down and watched. no clouds or branches in my line of sight.  there was a full moon 3 days ago so the night was quite bright. nothing obstructed my view.   i grabbed my video camera and went on the porch. planes were passing by which is quite unusual for this area,.. esp. so many.  i filmed a distant plane moving across the sky when i noticed another ball of light this one slightly smaller.  i looked away from my camera back at the big light and noticed it moving in small spurts and in miniscule circles and ovals.  it was moving so slow.  also, when i started looking at it, there were straight rays of glare protruding and fading from it much like the moon or sun but half way into! my experience, the rays started to form a concave appearance.  it was also blinking from time to time as with the smaller orb of light. my camera's memory became full at 21:29 so i came in the house to download it on the computer for full screen review. after watching, i locked my doors and put a comedy show on to distract me from my uneasiness.   at around 22:15, i looked back out the window and it was gone.   i locked my doors and did research unti i found this sight.  my ipad is now strangely giving me trouble.;41.1230666666667;-75.0309333333333

PD));2017-02-16 06:15:00;1 hour;On the night of 02/16/17 I saw a white light hovering in the distance.  I know it can't be a helicopter, no flashing lights, and not moving.  It also was not a tower being to high to be so. I thought it might be a star but there were none around and it was the only thing there shining brightly. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?
