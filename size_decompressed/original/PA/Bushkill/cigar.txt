Cigar Shaped Aircraft;2008-06-20 15:00:00;1 minute;When I was on my way home from my friend’s house, his mom was driving.  While on the road, I look through the back window and in the upper left corner, I saw a cigar shaped aircraft just hovering.  I do not completely recall the colors, but they might have been black with some blue, however, I do not remember.  I was going to tell my friend to look, but I felt discouraged to tell him due to past experiences from family.  So I didn’t tell him, but watched it until we drove out of sight.
