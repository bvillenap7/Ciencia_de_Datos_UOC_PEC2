Diamond/Star Like Bright Object Flying Low in the Sky with No other lights or sound.;2016-03-30 20:45:00;2 minutes;Diamond/Star Like Bright Object Flying Low in the Sky with No other lights or sound. At 8:45 pm on March 30, 2016, I witnessed a bright Diamond or Star shaped object in the sky.  It flew at a very low altitude.  It did not have any type of lights such as normal aircraft, plus we live in a no fly zone so usually you can see aircraft moving in the distance but not over our house ever. The object was very bright and traveled west in the southern sky before turning and traveling north.  The object remained at a slow speed, omitting no sound during the entire occurrence.  When my wife started flicking on and off our exterior light,  The object hovered for a few seconds in one spot then began to accelerate and rise into the sky until it looked like a distant star then faded out to nothing. Both my wife and I witnessed this type of craft and movement on numerous occasions in this area but this is the most recent occurrence.;41.1230666666667;-75.0309333333333
