Do things normally vanish into thin air?;2000-05-15 03:00:00;3 minutes;Do things normally vanish into thin air? I was walking home along a road which was not shaded by trees, it was a clear blue sky that wasn't hidden by any trees either. I looked up into the sky and in the exact center of the sky (from the direction I was looking towards) was one small, metalic-gold, circular object sitting perfectly still in the sky, while paying attention to this object I dropped something, I picked it up and when I looked back up, the object was nowhere to be seen, the speed that an object would have to have to accomplish this task would have to be extremely fast. I have told many people about this, and truely believe that it was a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD));41.1230666666667;-75.0309333333333
