Lights changing shape;2020-01-26 19:00:00;15 minutes;Lights changing shape Just over the tree line I saw what looked like a few lights in a changing configuration.  The lights went from yellow to green.  Sometimes lighting in a sequence then going out completely.  It hovered a distance away.  It wasn't a plane I had seen planes pass near it and above it.  It looked slightly oval but had a t formation with the lights changing color.  After several minutes it slowly moved to the west until it was behind the mountain tree line.  It was a cold clear night.;41.1230666666667;-75.0309333333333
