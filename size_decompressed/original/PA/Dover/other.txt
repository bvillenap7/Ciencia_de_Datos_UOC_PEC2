Red X in  the Sky.  ((anonymous report));2018-10-07 20:45:00;15 minutes;Red X in  the Sky I was sitting on our deck and noticed an unidentifiable object in the southwest sky.  It appeared reddish and was in the shape of an X.  It did not appear to be moving.  Watched it for about 15 minutes to make sure my eyes weren’t playing tricks on me.  Even went inside and came back out and I could still see it. In the morning I googled to try to find an explainable reason for seeing this.  The only thing I could come up with was a Red Rectangle Nebula, but it stated that that is not visible by the naked eye… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
