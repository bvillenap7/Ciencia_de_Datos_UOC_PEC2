Out of habit I always stand up and watch them.  As I heard them coming I looked up into the sky facing southwest (they are approaching from the S. West heading N. East) when I saw a cloud that seemed in the shape of a horseshoe. It disappated, the US Military planes flew over - watched them - then looked back from where they came and found a triangle in the sky not moving.  I didn't take my eyes off of it.  Then, fast as ever it headed directly towards the North, stopped on a dime, stayed still for about 30 seconds.  Then moved back to it's first position just as fast.  Then in a blink of an eye it went South West super fast and a small white round sphere came from it and darted with it out of sight.  A plane was coming from the east then (commercial airliner) and as I watched it another triangle was in the Western sky not moving. It followed the aircraft for a moment then went fast as lighting towards the south and out of sight.  It was amazing and terrifying all in one.  The triangle shaped objects appreared to be black in color.;40.335;-75.6588999999999
