red orange ball of fire;2010-10-23 21:00:00;10 minutes;red orange ball of fire I was attending the Boyertown Halloween parade with my 3 kids and I had gotten distracted by 3 reddish orange objects in the sky.  They kind of looked like a fireball.  Just kind of slowly hovering/flying.  I really dont know how to explain it.  I know I'm not the only one that saw these things someone else posted via internet about seeing these things too.;40.335;-75.6588999999999
