Orange orbs over night sky in Lehigh Valley, PA;2012-07-21 21:30:00;4 minutes;orange orbs over night sky in Lehigh Valley, PA I was sitting facing west on my patio with my husband and my parents last evening when I witnessed three orange orbs from a distance in the night sky around 9:30 pm.  They were in an elongated triangle.   Following that were numerous other orbs also orange in color.  These were not in a regular pattern but were coming at different time intervals but fairly close together.  This lasted approximately 3 or 4 minutes with the total number of orbs being approximately 15-20.  They were all coming from the west heading in a northeast direction.   All four of us on the patio watched this until they were out of site. Since our international airport (ABE) is twelve miles east of us, I phoned the airport and was able to access the control tower. I told the person I spoke with what we had seen and he told me that what I had described  is not on their radar.;40.6276;-75.6011
