There was a bright blueish/greenish hazed lighted object making absolutely no sound, moving west to east,  It was  rather low in the sky about 100 feet above the tree line.  A small motored plane was much higher and eastward that I could here and see and I could distinguish its wing lights.  This lighted object continued straight over the treeline, then turned northwest, very rapidly ascending out of sight.;40.6276;-75.6011
