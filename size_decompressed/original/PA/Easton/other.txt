My husband and I were sitting in our hot tub with the lights off when we looked up and saw a V or boomerang shape formation of about 12-15 lights.  We watched it fly east across the sky turning and disappearing from view.  It moved in perfect formation and incredibly fast.  It was very high and the lights were more faded yellow but it was easy to follow with your eyes and track.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
