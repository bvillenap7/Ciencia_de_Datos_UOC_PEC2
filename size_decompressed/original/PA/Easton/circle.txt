Four brilliant red round silent crafts flying over Easton Pennsylvania.;2015-08-15 19:30:00;10 minutes;Four brilliant red round silent crafts flying over Easton Pennsylvania. My wife and I were walking our dog at dusk when I noticed what I thought at first was a plane.  We live in a plane throughway so we are use to seeing planes go overhead.   I have lived in this area for 40+ years, what caught my attention was that there were no flashing lights just a ball of red.  And there was no sound at all.   When it flew past us we joked about the what we may be seeing, as it very slowly flew east toward New Jersey.  When from the same direction as the first one (west) three more red ball crafts flying in perfect vertical order slowly, quietly, flew in the same direction!  Then they seem to stop going west, and started to accent straight up until they were no longer visible.   We looked at each other and ask ourselves what the heck did we just witness?  Unless we have some super quiet, super slow, new aircraft I don't know.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Red dots seen in the sky Christmas Eve 2015 Easton, Pennsylvania.;2015-12-24 20:07:00;4 minutes;Red dots seen in the sky Christmas Eve 2015 Easton, Pennsylvania. These appear to be red dots in the sky.  Approximately eight of them.  Each of them had quite a distance in between them.  One would go off and then shortly after another one and then another one in this continued for probably four minutes.  They seem to be following each other.   I had video of the last 2 and a half minutes.  Because it was Christmas eve, I thought that perhaps someone was launching a type of hot air balloon or other type objects in the sky.   But they were extremely high in the sky and then that didn't seem likely to me.   I don't know if there were any other reports of these things in my area.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
