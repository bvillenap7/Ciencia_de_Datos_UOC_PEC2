An object  was seen hovering above a suburban neighborhood.;2003-10-16 18:46:00;2 minutes;An object  was seen hovering above a suburban neighborhood. While parking my car outside my house (suburban neighborhood), I noticed what I thought at first was a plane flying low overhead.  After parking, I got out and took a look up.  The object was still there, hovering silently.  It didn't seem to be any aircraft I recognize.  The shape was hard to make out as an amber-colored light was shining presumably right at me.  I'd say it was either a triangle or a chevron, though the front seemed rounded a bit (hence why I have unknown selected).  It was perhaps 100 ft. in the air and only around the size of a small plane, though this is also hard to say for sure given that it was past sunset.   Next, I felt a brief feeling of dizziness as the object slowly flew away.  I heard a very faint sound as it did this.   Presumably as a result of the disoriented feeling, I didn't turn my head much to follow it.  It didn't matter as it seemed to disappear as it was at the very edge of my field of vision.   After this, the disorienation was gone and I noticed several people on a 2nd floor balcony several houses up the street who seemed to have seen the object also.  It's hard to definitively state the number of witnesses, as I can't say who else may have possibly been looking outside from a window, etc.  I never asked the people from a few houses up about it.  (Additional note:  I have checked I would like to be contacted by an investigator.  This is not to say that I am demanding such, but I won't mind answering further questions on it.);40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
It moved backwards before it disappeared.;2015-02-22 19:00:00;60-90 seconds;It moved backwards before it disappeared. The object was going south at a slow rate of speed.   It stopped came back north in a straight line for ten seconds or so and then disappeared.   It was too bright to see the shape when i looked at it with binoculars and it had no blinking lights, but it did seem to have a light shining upwards out the top.   It made no sound.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
100 PLUS FLYING FLASHING LIGHTS.;2019-01-25 19:00:00;10-15 minutes;100 PLUS FLYING FLASHING LIGHTS 1/25/2019 Approximately 7:05 PM, EST. I was laying on the floor, watching tv, and the window is directly to my right.  I saw a very bright light and what I thought was a low flying plane, as we are in the LaGuardia flight pattern.   When I saw the third one whiz by in less than 20 seconds, I ran out back to see about ten (10) flashing objects that were red, orange, and yellow in color, moving quickly across the sky a little south over our house.  They were moving from the southwest to northeast at a fairly good speed.   I screamed for my husband and he came out and saw them as well and he called our next-door neighbors who live approximately 60 feet to our east.  The husband and wife both came outside and watched them from their back deck which is approximately 3.5 feet off the ground.  My husband and I were on a level brick patio.   They continued to fly over for about 10-15 minutes.  Estimate approximately 100 individual flying objects.  I called our son who lives approximately one mile south and he got to an area ! above his apartment where he could see them in the distance, looking north towards our home.   I called 911 to report the incident while it was occurring.  I also posted something on our local Facebook Residentâ€™s page and just saw that someone else saw them.   I called our local television station and reported it.  They indicated that I was the first to call them about it and they would call around and inquire about it.  I gave them my phone number.    I would estimate that the objects were flying under 5,000 feet in the sky.  The sky is clear and you can see the usual jets flying in their flight pattern and the stars very clearly.  These were not jets or stars.   We could not see any shape to them due to the brightness of the flashing lights.  They came in clusters of about ten (10) at a time, with maybe one (1) minute spacing for approximately 10-15 minutes.   When one group passed, you could then see the next group heading towards us from the west.   I tried to take a video of them, but the video didn't come out.  My camera just shows ! a black image where I took the video.  Also, I took a picture accidentally while I was trying to get my camera to videotape and that picture does not show up on my camera either.  My neighbor took out his camera only to find that his battery was dead.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
