One took off as soon as I was about 300 yards of it. The second stayed until I was about 100 yards away then just dissapeared into thin air. I don't know much more because it was in broad daylight.

Fireballs 20-30 minutes reddish orange eastern Pa northampton county two witnesses.;2012-10-14 20:00:00;twenty or thirty minutes;Fireballs 20-30 minutes reddish orange eastern Pa northampton county two witnesses. On the night in question, my girlfriend and I were driving north on Zucksville Road, in Forks Township, Easton, PA.  Around 8 oclock or so, I noticed a reddish orange light in the sky off to my right (southeast) through the trees.  At first, I thought it was the lights from the radio antenna that is located on the top of the mountain, but then I saw the actual radio antenna and realized that that was not what I was seeing.  The first light passed over the car in the sky as we drove, moving southeast to northwest. As I said, it was reddish orange in color, and lacked the flickering nature of airplane lights but instead looked almost like a fireball, with a densely colored center and a lighter halo or corona. It would occasionally 'pulse', growing slightly dimmer and then growing brighter again, and eventually we lost sight of it because, while driving, it was unsafe to try and keep it in sight. We were on our way to pick up a pizza at a restaurant a mile or so n! orth of where we first saw the light, and when we pulled into the parking lot, we noticed there were two more lights moving from the southwest to the northeast. Just like the first one we saw, these two lights were orange in color with a weird pulsing effect. There was no noise, no erratic movement, just a leisurely uniform pace. At one point, they moved in almost parallel lines with one another. As those two moved over the horizon, we noticed again, from the same point of origin, another light. It followed the same track as the first two. We drove down to another parking lot to get a better point of view, and witnessed two more objects following the same course: as one would approach the horizon to the southeast, one would appear to the northwest. All of the objects were of the same color and brightness, with the same pulsing effect. Again, for clarity's sake, there was no flickering or flashing or strobing that is associated with airplane lights, just a slow occasional pu! lse. At one point, an airplane did cross paths with one, and t! he diffe rence between the lights of an airplane and the objects was apparent. To be fair, there is a small local airport nearby, but none of the objects were going anywhere near the airport and they did not resemble the lights of an airplane. I took several short videos with my phone, but unfortunately the quality does little justice to the incident.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
Ufo above Williams twp and Bethlehem fireworks!;2013-07-04 21:15:00;2-3 minutes;Ufo above Williams twp and Bethlehem fireworks! Driving behind giant shopping center.  Saw a truck pulled over and 2 people looking up. I assumed they were watching the finale of the fireworks that I believe we're coming from Bethlehem.  I then realized the 2 people were looking above and to the left of the fireworks so I stopped and got out.  I saw a fireball moving along the mountain range that is Williams township toward Bethlehem.   It was well above the fireworks (over 1500 ft above) and I observed the object stop above Williams township for about 1 minute and then speed toward the fireworks which would be at least 10 miles away in less then 1 minute.   It then began to move toward the mountain range and disappear behind it.   The entire time would have been 3 minutes that I watched this thing with my own eyes.   The 2 people standing there stated they were observing it for 10 minutes and believed it to be a ufo.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713

Round object high in sky with flames coming from it.;2013-09-05 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Round object high in sky with flames coming from it Last night around 9:00 p.m., I was walking my dog on South Side Easton on Milton St right at Milton Park.  Very high in the sky, I saw what appeared to be a plane on fire yet it continued to move across the sky at the speed of a plane.  It was more round however than a plane and I could hear no sound.  I then thought that maybe it was a hot air balloon, but it was way too high, and moving too fast for that.  I took video of it with my phone, but of course on video, you definitely lose what it really looked like with the naked eye.  It continued traveling until suddenly it seemed like the flame went out or it simply disappeared.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
