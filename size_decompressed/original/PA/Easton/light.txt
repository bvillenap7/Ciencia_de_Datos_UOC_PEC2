Fast moving blue dot over Delaware River near Easton, PA;2010-04-22 00:30:00;12 seconds;Fast moving blue dot over Delaware River near Easton, PA I spotted a fast moving blue light speed across the sky possibly over the western edge of New Jersey airspace heading north to south.  There were no other lights, and the blue dot that I saw was steady / unblinking.  Its altitude was likely what would be normal for smaller aircraft.  I can not estimate its speed, but it moved from my left to my right in about 2 seconds.  I continued to see it for about another 10 seconds as it continued south over Rt 22 and 78, and it seemed to slow only because my view of it was looking at it from the back.  The light was about the size of a bright object like Venus and was both clearly moving and definitely blue in color.  There were no sounds accompanying it.  The route that it traveled is a route I commonly see A-10's fly, but it was significantly faster than an A-10 (and slower than a meteor and did not fade).;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713

Saw bright light while driving girlfriend home and after telling her to film it, it disappeared.;2015-01-06 17:50:00;1 minute;Saw bright light while driving girlfriend home and after telling her to film it, it disappeared. My girlfriend and I were driving on Old Mill Road in Forks Township.  We noticed a big bright light in the sky and thought it was Venus.  Upon closer examination, the light had a weirdness about it.  It hung in the air in a way that suggested it was in the atmosphere and not a star or planet.   After telling my girlfriend to film it, we drove past trees that covered our view.  After making a turn on Wagonwheel, we regained a full view of the sky but the object had disappeared.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
