I couldn't believe my eyes.  My wife wanted me to follow it.  but traffic was too slow.  Somebody else should have seen it .  My children were the other witnesses. The object was cigar shaped with 4 -5 white lights  on each side of its  length. I would estimate the length at 50 -60 ft  and its width maybe  about 15 ft.  It appeared to be low in the sky maybe 400 - 500 ft. in altitude.  It was traveling  from west to east as I was driving south on 25th Street.   I could not distinguish a color as it was dark out  at  approx.  19:30 . When we reached the intersection I turned left onto Butler St.  heading east and could still see the object but it was much to distant for me to keep up  and I aborted the chase.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
