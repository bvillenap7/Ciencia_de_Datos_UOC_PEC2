Floating small red lights.;2013-09-15 20:00:00;15 minutes;Floating small red lights. I was getting onto Rt. 33 North bound as I was merging onto the highway from the William Penn exit I could see a trail of lights.  At first I thought it was a fleet of helicopters, there must have been at least a dozen lights. The lights were red to orange and they were steady, there was no pulsation.  They started out scattered but slowly made their way into a large almost rectangular shape.  It was easily the size of 4-5 football fields. It struck me as strange because the lights were very small and very low in the air.  The best way I could describe them would to be to compare them to floating ping pong balls.  They moved slowly and in formation.  Multiple people pulled to the side of the road and began taking videos and photos. It was much to large and too low to be an airplane, and it was too small and too quiet to be helicopters. There was no sound what so ever, just floating lights.  It was eerily beautiful. My parents house is very close to the highway so it takes me less than 2 mintues to from their house.  The reason that this is important is that I left when I did becuase the sound on our TV kept mysteriously and unexplainably kept shutting off and the picture would break up every now and again. I would like to add, that I was alone in the car, in a sober state of mind, with no drugs/alcohol in my system.  I have a college education and am in the medical field.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
Motionless lights in formation.;2018-02-26 20:15:00;2-5 minutes;motionless lights in formation It started with a very loud noise, almost like a heavy train speeding over rails, or very high-pitch almost screaming-like jet noise. We went outside and saw a 7 lights. some were in perfect moitonless formation, others were spread.  This is the first time either of us saw or heard anything like it before.  It sounded like it was very loud and very far up.  Definitely not drones. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
