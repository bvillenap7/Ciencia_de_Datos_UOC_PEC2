Raubesville Pa, Bright orange star shaped light fast moving, hovered and the shot back into the sky again.;2010-09-18 23:45:00;5 mins;Raubesville Pa, Bright orange star shaped light fast moving, hovered and the shot back into the sky again. Driving on Royal Manor Rd in Raubesville at 11:45 at night. We saw star shaped bright orange light moving quite fast toward road. I thought it was a shooting star at first, but it wasn't moving across the sky it was coming to down. We stopped to watch, the object slowed down and seemed to hover and then turned and shot back up into the sky and dissapeared with in about 4 seconds. As the object turned it had orange light which followed, like orange jet stream. We have never seen anything like this before. We called and reported it and next morning as I was on 611N I saw 4 military vehicles heading south on 611toward Raubesville. I have never seen military vehicles in this area before.  Maybe be coincidence I don't know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
