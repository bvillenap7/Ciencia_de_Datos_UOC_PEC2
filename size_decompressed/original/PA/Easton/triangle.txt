Craftt in the treetops;2001-10-02 07:15:00;5-7minutes;a craft in the treetops a full moon, which made this very visible. Myself and my 15 year old nephew were driving south towards Easton,Pa. on a road that runs a mile or so through an industial park. I then noticed about 75 feet off the road (which I went back the following day and realized it was an entry drive to a company and 75 feet off the road it had an area heavily shrubbed with mature trees (circular area) and then another 50 feet to the parking lot) 25 to 30 feet in air, in the shrubbed area , were some lites. We pulled into the drive and looked up out of our windows at what appeared to be a small dark triangular craft with 3 orange lites, hovering right above the treetops. This object made no sound what so ever. Next it moved exceptionally slow(almost a glide) about 150 feet away and stopped. We gave it the logical reasoning that there is a private airport a quarter mile away and it was right after september 11 and the crop dusting warnings and we thought it was govermental craft we were unaware of monituring the area as we are only 60 miles from  NY city. We watched sit still and then the orange lites (just one) blinked and it was gone.Ofcourse we asked a few people in our area if they had heard or seen anything that nite, but they had not.

8/31/04 21:15  large triangular shaped craft seen in sky Easton, PA;2004-08-31 21:15:00;3 minutes;8/31/04 21:15  large triangular shaped craft seen in sky Easton, PA Off of the exit ramp of rt 33 and rt 248 a triangular shaped craft was hovering above the highway at approx 1200 feet or less. It had numerous bright non-flashing white lights as well as a flashing red light. The flashing red light was not consistent. There was no noticeable noise and the craft turned 180 degrees towards the SW and accelerated rapidly out of sight. My fiance who was with me at the time has flown planes and this did not look like a plane or helicopter to him. Im sure that due to the traffic on 33 at the time and because of how clear the night sky was with a full moon and no clouds that there were many others who witnessed this. I would also like to add that while on my cell phone i was disconnected and the person i was talking to head beeping noises over the line.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
Triangular craft blue lights.;2008-02-04 23:00:00;3 minutes;Triangular craft blue lights. Around 11pm I was standing on the balcony of my apartment. It was cloudy and all of a sudden I saw a triangular craft with blue lights hovering over the moutains to the north about 500' above it. I watched it lasted about 3 minutes and then took off in a north eastern direction very quicly. I knew this wasnt an airplane it appeared to low and the clouds didnt obstruct it.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713

Low-flying, dark triangle seen over Easton, PA;2016-04-30 23:50:00;30 seconds;Low-flying, dark triangle seen over Easton, PA On April 30, 2016, at approximately 23:50, a dark, triangular shaped object, was seen by my brother and I, flying slowly, approximately 500 ft. above the treetops. Its distance was only about 2 miles from where we had sighted it, flying over the West Ward of the city.  I could only guess at the size of the craft, possibly being 70-75 ft. from tip to tip of the wingspan. When first noticed, the bright-white lights on its underside were facing us, as it was banking 90 degrees on its port side.  There were at least four, but more probably six lights, all white and very bright. When I had first spotted it, the aircraft was flying in an easterly direction in this 90 degree position, then it hooked sharply and headed NNW, immediately leveling out its flight after completing the turn.  I believe one red and one green, slow-flashing light was positioned respectively on the left and right wing-tops as it headed away from us. The total time of observation was about 30 seconds. I've never seen a craft of this size move this slow, traveling this low and making such an immediate hard turn.  Personally, I wouldn't doubt if this was a military aircraft, as it was very exotic to me, but didn't strike me as being non-terrestrial.  Some people that I have described the sighting to, believe it may have been a military drone.  Possibly, of the TR-3 family.;40.6697357142858;-75.2453089285713
