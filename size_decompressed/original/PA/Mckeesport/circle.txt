Five glowing reddish-yellow circular objects drifted slowly over my house, heading east, on the evening of 10/22/13.;2013-10-22 18:58:00;5 minutes;Five glowing reddish-yellow circular objects drifted slowly over my house, heading east, on the evening of 10/22/13. At around 6:58 PM, I looked out my upper window (which faces east) and saw four very bright reddish yellow circular objects high in the sky.  As I watched, a fifth one appeared almost directly above the house.  They looked like they were slowly descending, made no sound at all, and slowly faded and disappeared.  Each object was red with a bright yellow center that looked like a flame.  I originally posted this sighting on my Facebook page for 10/22/13 (it can still be seen along with other items from the same period.)   I sent this report to you because I just read a report on your site from 10/22/13 describing objects very similar to the ones I saw.  That report came from Monroeville, PA, which is very close to McKeesport, and occurred about two hours after I had seen the objects.;40.3469;-79.8689
