Standing on my deck noticed a diamond shaped object at first thought it was a star until I noticed 4 red lights in the shape of a triangle.  It did not move nor did it make a sound.  Then it omitted an identical craft that came out of it somehow.  So now there are 2 just sitting there.  This is the second night in a row.  I go in to get my phone and it is gone then reappears in a different area in the sky over a rural area.  It is not a plane!!!  Kinda spooky.  My husband has also seen the same thing on a separate occasion.  We are both Security officers trained to observe and have an eye for detail.  This happened in Elizabeth Twp. Area, facing South;40.3469;-79.8689
