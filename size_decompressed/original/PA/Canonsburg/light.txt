I tried to go back to sleep and then decided to get up to use the bathroom.  Upon return back to my bedroom I was startled to see that the room was filled with bright orange light.  The light was intense as it streamed through the northeasterly facing window. Shadows were cast in the folds of the curtains.  I went to the window and saw a rather large (dime at arms length) orange sphere of bright light directly ahead approximately 200 feet away viewable just over the space between the roofs of two houses on the hill in front of me.  I turned to get my glasses and all of the orange light suddenly disappeared so I immediately turned back to the window.  The light blinked on and off two or three times and then completely ceased to be visible.   I continued to watch for it out of the window but it did not return.  Later in the week of 3-24-08, my sister who lives 2 streets away in the same northeasterly direction stopped by for a visit.  One of the first things she said to me was, What was up with that orange light Monday?  However she saw a more diffused generalized orange glow over a school ball field immediately in front of her house that spread over a couple of blocks and she saw it in the evening of that day.  The orange light of 3-24-08 was the sixth sighting in my lifetime thus far. I reported another to NUFORC that occurred on 1-12-08 and was witnessed by more people than just myself.  I am a contactee and I converse regularly with other experiencers on an almost daily basis.  I am mentioning this because during the period of time just prior to 3-24-08, many of my abbductee acquaintances reported paranormal experiences and there was a general consensus that something is going on.   For example, one friend saw an entity at his bedside another had a sighting, and another suffered nosebleeds after a dream visit with a man that she has not seen for many years but has come to think of as sort of a guardian angel.  I find it odd that I have had two sightings already in 2008 and that my last previous sighting was 24 years ago in 1984.   500 Lights On Object0: Yes;40.2692;-80.1611
multiple craft following each other and disappearing on a clear night.   ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-05 20:14:00;60 seconds;multiple craft following each other and disappearing on a clear night Outside stargazing to the north.  Saw what appeared to be a star moving in the easterly direction at a speed that appeared to be a bit faster than a commercial aircraft.  No big deal.  However, then I noticed a second one following in the first.  Then a third, and forth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth.  All at the same speed and in what appeared to be exact spacing.  The first began to fade away as it entered into a wispy, narrow cloud bank.  It never appeared to emerge out the other side.  Neither did any of the others.  Rather strange.;40.2692;-80.1611
