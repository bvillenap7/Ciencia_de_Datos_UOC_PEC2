V;2015-06-10 23:00:00;4 minutes;I seen an orange ball very illuminated moving at a rate to be around 35mph going west to northeast.  Look to be at about 2500 feet up.   Very windy today and i thought it could be a weather balloon that was illuminated from the inside.   Been around avation all my life and i am a star gazer but i have never seen anything like this in my life.  It really glowed bright orange.   I ran in the house and had my daughter come out and witness it.  I was shocked because it made no sound.   I am experianced in avation but never seen anything like this.  My only explaination is a balloon that was internally lite.  It traveled the same direction as the wind was blowing. Very bright orange.
