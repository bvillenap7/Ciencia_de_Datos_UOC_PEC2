At first it appeared to be the sun's rays illuminating in a faint circle behind some whispy clouds.  However, to the left of this ball of light was the sun, visibly glowing light yellow in the sky with no clouds in front of it.  It was stationary, however once we had driven a little further down the road it was out of our line of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
