He only observed the bottom of the object. It was a disc and it  had visible structures of concentric rings and spokes coming from the center. The rings and spokes formed segments that were colored gold, silver, and a luminous yellow-like quality that he found especially difficult to describe. It appeared below the clouds and appeared to be quite large, though he reportedly had no visual reference with which to compare it. It appeared suddenly, made no sound, made no movements, and disappeared just as suddenly after about 5 seconds. For being so anomalous, his reaction to seeing the object was one of brief puzzlement.  He felt no fear or shock and simply returned to his chore.  He thought about it as he worked and considered it a hallucination of some sort.  However, he had never hallucinated before and the object had such a quality of being present that he found it ! hard to categorize it as a hallucination and said nothing of it to anyone and simply thought about it for some time before deciding to make the report.
