A bright white light disappearing  and reappearing in the sky which then descended straight down out of sight.;2012-04-12 21:00:00;1 minutes;A bright white light disappearing  and reappearing in the sky which then descended straight down out of sight I am a trained surgical technican however I am working as the accountant for our privately owned business. Where I am located:  Northeastern corner of Armstrong Co., PA, U.S.A. / sun rises at 90 degrees East of North, from our rural home. Area of sky where light was seen:  40 to 45 degrees East of North / from where I stood the object was at an angle of 35 to 45 degrees upward. Description:  There was a very bright white light, roughly the size and brightness of the 'Arcturus' star (maybe a bit larger and brighter), to the naked eye, above the tree line.  My thought was, I do not remember seeing a star or planet in that part of the sky, that bright, this week.   Just as I had said that to myself, the light disappeared.  Seconds later, the light reappeared, seeing it through the leafless trees and again it disappeared.  A few seconds later, it reappeared a bit lower and more to the east.  At that point, I watched it slowly descend straight down until I could no longer see it, due to the hillside.  It was not as bright when it was in the tree line however, never changed size.
