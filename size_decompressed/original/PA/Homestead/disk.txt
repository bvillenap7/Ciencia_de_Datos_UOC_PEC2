My friend in butler, PA, soon called me after decribing a very simular oval shaped disk traveling at a great speed.  Also, I have been hearing an unknown sound kind of like a jet, however very consistent in duration. This happened in west Mifflin, PA, at the times 9:50 - 12:03 very loud sounds;40.3926;-79.9052
