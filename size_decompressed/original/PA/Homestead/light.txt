Object was spotted while walking up a hill, coming from a gas station. It looked like a light on a helicopter but, it was brighter and motionless. As I walked to an alleyway behind my apt. my view was blocked by a home at the beginning on the alley.  My neighbors boyfriend was standing there on the phone.  He got off and we started talking about life other than here on earth, when we noticed very dim lights that looked like stars in motion leave the earth.   Shortly after, the object I first seen while coming up the hill began slowly coming into viewfrom behind the home at the end of the alley.  I asked him what did he think this was and he said he don't know.   We watched it for about a half an hour til it moved in line with the middle of the alleyway.  Then I told him to get his girlfriend so she can see this as she didn't believe in UFOs.  She came out and freaked when she saw this object.  It seemed to be looking at us and was turning every color in the spectrum.   It sat in this spot for another 90 minutes or so and began to slowly move farther away.  As it was moving, my neighbor noticed jets flying toward the object (6 of them).  They one by one flew over to this object and did it in large circles like it was seen on their radars as an anomaly.   There were also low flying black helicopters with no lights on them doing fly overs.   I remember everything like it happened today!!!;40.3926;-79.9052
