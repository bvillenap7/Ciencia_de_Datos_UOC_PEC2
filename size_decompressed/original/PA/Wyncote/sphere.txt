Cheltenham Township - just north of Philadelphia, PA at approximately 9:45 am on December 21,2001 I was walking my dog when something in the sky caught my eye.  It was a string of spherical objects, approximately 8 to 11 of them.  They were in a perfectly straight line moving in a south westerly direction.  They were about the height of commercial aircraft. they were larger than stars and smaller than the sun.  I saw them for about 45 seconds, and then they just disappeared.  The sky was blue with no clouds near the objects.;40.0857;-75.1494
