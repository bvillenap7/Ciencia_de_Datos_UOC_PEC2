A bright orange sphere sighted in central Pennsylvania.;2009-01-04 00:15:00;5 seconds;A bright orange sphere sighted in central Pennsylvania. The ufo was sighted at approximately 12:15 AM by me 15 years old and my father 41 years old.  We were going home when a large orange sphere was sighted by both of us.  It looked just as if the moon was impossibly close to the earth.  There was a shadow covering the top half, but you could tell there was another half there.  We got about a 5 second glance at the object when a mountain obstructed our view, we were still moving at this point, we didn't pull over.  Then, as we were rounding a corner, expecting to see the object, it wasn't there.  The object was not seen after that point.;41.247;-77.2706
