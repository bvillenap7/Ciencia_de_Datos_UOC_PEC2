The craft was triangle shaped and on each point was a light: green, red, and white.  It seemed to slow down above us.  It ascended over the building next to the passenger's side and, with great speed, it kept ascending and flew from our sight.   It is important to notes that we were So close that I could see triangle shaped etching on the bottom of the craft.;41.5349000000001;-75.9472

The object seemed to have a sort of triangular shape with 1 red light coming from the center of its mass.   As we continued to drive under it we were still amazed by what we saw we passed it by like 100 feet but could still see it hovering in the same spot so I told my friend that was driving to turn around so we could get physical evidence of it like a photo or video and as he commenced making the U turn, it saw us, because in like 1-2 seconds it flew over a hillside like 2 miles away.. nothing man made can cover that distance in that amount of time that's when I knew without a doubt what I just seen.   Also I was looking online at some sketches of various different ufo's seen throughout history and I found one that was a really close match almost identical.
