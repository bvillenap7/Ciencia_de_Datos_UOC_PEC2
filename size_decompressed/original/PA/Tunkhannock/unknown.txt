I went in to wake my wife to show her, and by the time I got back outside again I couldn't find them again.  I could see airplanes in the sky as well and by comparrison the airplanes seemed alot lower in the sky and about twice as fast.;41.5349000000001;-75.9472
Strange Three Tone Sound, above home and lake, Tv and Security monitors dim and power outage.;2013-05-30 22:35:00;30 seconds;Strange Three Tone Sound, above home and lake, Tv and Security monitors dim and power outage Something STRANGE Happened Last Night @ 10.35 p.m. This event happened, while watching a movie, at home and reading e-mail. At 10:35 p.m. I first heard a Three Tone sound outside, the sound, became louder and louder, ----  My tv started dimming, my computer and security monitors started to get dimmer, then the lights and everything went out.   Then about 15 seconds later the sound outside stopped, and the power came back on. ----This cannot be from a transformer because the transformer is behind the home. The Sound was coming from above in the air, and in the front of my home, over the lake. I feel good today, I also do feel that nothing happened to me, from what ever was going on........ It's about time, it probably happened to another person at the lake. I do not have any recordings either sound or video, but I was not expecting anything, to happen to start with.  That Sound was pretty loud, with three tones hard to explain. did not sound like a jet or a helicopter, or a musical instrutment..... STRANGE to say the least........;41.5349000000001;-75.9472
