Flashing colors appeared to be spinning;2008-01-03 20:00:00;2 Hours;Flashing colors appeared to be spinning At approx. 8:00 on Thursday night, i saw a light in the eastern sky.  It appeared just to be a bright star at first but started changing colors.  After about twenty minutes, i went back outside and saw the light still there but seemed to have moved southeast some.  I went inside and asked my roommate to come look along with his girlfriend.  They both saw it also.  The light seemed to be red on top with flashing of blue and green around it.  It seemed to be very distant but very bright.  Probably nothing but it also seemed to be spinning rapidly.  So much staring probably caused it to just appear that way.  Just thought it was unusual, but i did see something similar earlier this year in almost the same location.;41.5349000000001;-75.9472
