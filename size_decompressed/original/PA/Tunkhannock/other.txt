There were three lights. They just hovered in the air for about 1 minute. Then the lights went out, and in only 4 or 5 seconds the dark object cleared the intire distance of the sky. When I arived home I became shocked to find that I had lost ten extra minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));41.5349000000001;-75.9472
