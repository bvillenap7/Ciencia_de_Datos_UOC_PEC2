Luminescent cigar shape craft in daylight.;2020-08-08 19:25:00;20 seconds;Luminescent cigar shape craft in daylight. At first it appeared to be sunlight reflecting off the underside of an airplane.  In a second I saw that there were no wings and brought it to the attention of my companion who described the same. The craft seemed to be the hight of a passenger jet and traveling the right speed but after observing it for fifteen to twenty seconds, it vanished in a clear blue sky. Cigar shaped.  The front and back were luminescent with a short non luminescent space in the middle.;41.5349000000001;-75.9472
