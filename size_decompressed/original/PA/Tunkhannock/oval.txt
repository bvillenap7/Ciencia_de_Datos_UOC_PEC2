A yellow gold, brilliant, luminous, sparkling somewhat round, speedy glow came from above the mtn. across the hollow straight towards the house extremely low as if it was going to crash, not above the tree line in the middle as if it were going to hit and it went behind the trees behind the house, low and fast.  I ran upstairs to see if It crashed into the mtn. behind us.  I am a nursing asst. I am not crazy. This was so orb like an exciting, yet jittery to the nerves.  I could not take my eyes off it.  I looked on the news the next a.m. and nothing.  I will walk to the bowl of the mtn.  Today behind the house just for my own sanity, it was so low I felt it had to crash.  This memory will go to my grave with me,absolutely phenomenal.  Thank You for your time.;41.5349000000001;-75.9472
