Multi-colored lights over Furlong, PA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling stars??  PD));2013-05-04 20:45:00;40 minutes;Multi-colored lights over Furlong, PA This is the second consecutive night for seeing multi-colored lights in the sky.  We noticed this at approximately 8:45PM and viewed them for approximately 40+ min.   First one was seen at approximately 250 degrees WSW in the sky from Furlong, PA.  It was in approximately the same location as the previous night.   The night was clear, 52 degrees F, and wind speed of 5 mph and gusts to 5 mph.   The object appeared to be linear in shape with changing multi-colored lights.  When the object was most clear (in focus) it appeared to have 4 to 5 lights in a row.  Black space could be distinguished between the lights.   The lights changed color and had colors of yellowish, reddish, blue, green and white light.   The object appeared stationary mostly and moved slowly towards the horizon over time.   Two additional objects with multi-colored lights were also seen.  One was more westerly, the other more NEE in direction.  I used a Celestron Ultima 80 to view the objects.  Other planes were in the sky at the time.   These objects seemed too different to be mistaken as planes or stars.  Most notable things were they were multi-colored and linear in shape.;40.2979;-75.0634
