Multi-colored lights seen from Furlong, PA.;2013-05-03 21:00:00;25 minutes;Multi-colored lights seen from Furlong, PA. Observed from Furlong area around 9:00 PM, toward Westerly sky we noticed a brighter than usual star made more unusual as it was twinkling two alternating colors, red and blue.  We watched the object for 25 minutes.  It appeared stationary at times, but over time moved very slowly away from our view.  Planes were in view and one helicopter, all with lights.  None looked comparable and moved much faster than the object we saw.   I used a Celestron Ultima 80 scope to get a better view.  At times it appeared as two linear lights, sometimes as multiple lights in a spherical shape with a more solid vertical line of lights.  As it moved further out of view it appeared as a sphere that emitted a constantly changing rainbow of lights, actually beautiful.;40.2979;-75.0634
