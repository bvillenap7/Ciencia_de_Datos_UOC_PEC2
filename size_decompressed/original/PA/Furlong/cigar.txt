1 chrome cigar shaped object;2008-10-30 07:00:00;3-4 minutes;1 chrome cigar shaped object Around 9:20 am in the morning, on 10/30/08, I was walking my dogs in my backyard, when a small flash in the sky caught my attention.  I looked up and saw a bright chrome object moving throught he sky.  I almost disregarded it, till I noticed it didn't have wings.  It was shaped like a cigar, and towards the back, instead of being chrome, it looked almost as if it was gold.  It didn't fly straight it sort of floated in my direction then floated in another direction while still moving forward.  There was no vapor trail.  It also somehow grabbed the attention of my two dogs, who watched it with me till it disappeared behind the trees.;40.2979;-75.0634
