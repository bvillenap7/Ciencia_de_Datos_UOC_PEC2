Bluish-white objects playing tag in McDonald, PA;2014-02-01 20:00:00;1 hour;Bluish-white objects playing tag in McDonald, PA We were driving along fort cherry rd. when we saw these bluish white lights chasing each other across the sky.  It looked like the two objects were playing tag with each other.  They didn't have a definite shape since they were in the clouds.  But they looked like they could be circular in shape if they were out of the clouds.  They were only visible to the naked eye and no camera could seem to pick up the objects.;40.3724;-80.2527
