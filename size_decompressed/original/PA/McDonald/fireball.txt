Glowing object seen in sky over SW Pennsylvania on July 4, 2010;2010-07-04 09:30:00;<1 minute;Glowing object seen in sky over SW Pennsylvania on July 4, 2010 The object appeared on a clear, dark evening from the S/SW sky and traveled N/NW.  It was traveling very fast, faster than commercial aircraft flying through the landing patterns to Greater Pittsburgh International Airport (which is a common occurrence in our neighborhood).  It was on a straight flight path the object stayed on the same path and did not divert from the path nor did it slow down or speed up - it remained constant.  Looking with naked eyes, the object appeared to be a very fast moving hot air ballon as it seemed to be glowing orange.  There was no sound that could be heard as it passed overhead.  It did not appear to have a wingspan or any type of other lights you would commonly see on commercial aircrafts.  The object passed over our group twice in the same exact pattern within a matter of 15-20 minutes.  I checked NASA's website for ISS viewings and there were none listed in our region for that night.  I don't know what it was but I believe ! with all of my rational being that it was not a manmade aircraft, a comet, a reflection, or a firework.;40.3724;-80.2527
