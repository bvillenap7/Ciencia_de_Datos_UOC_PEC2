Was looking for a winter storm that's forecast for today, Sky has wispy clouds and the half moon is visible.  I noticed X's in the sky.  As I watched, a large silvery jet at a fairly low altitude flew a pattern crossing a long branch of one of the X's.  There was a passenger jet higher up, flying northwest, and the contrail was minimal.  There is definitely a storm coming from the northwest.  What would be the purpose of this? I wish I had a camera, because the trails are perfectly straight and the pattern is very consistent.  I kid you not, its tic-tac-toe boards in the sky.;40.3356;-79.6185
