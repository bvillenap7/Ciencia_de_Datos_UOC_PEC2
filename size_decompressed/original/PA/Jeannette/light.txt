Silent light heading over night sky.;2011-06-29 22:00:00;2 minutes;Silent light heading over night sky As I was walking to my car from my house to lock it up for the night, I glanced back to the east-southeast direction.  I noticed it was a very clear night, and saw what I thought to be Jupiter, simply because it was the most prominent object in the sky.  I glanced at it for a second or two, then proceeded to my car. As I finished replacing the floor mats in my car and locking it up, I then proceeded to walk back towards the house, once again looking up in the sky in a east-southeasterly direction.  I noticed that the object that I assumed to be Jupiter, was now moving in a westerly direction at a speed similar to commercial aircraft. However, the main reason I believe this was a UFO, was because the light was much more prominent than any aircraft lights, and there were no marker lights on the wings (red and blue commonly seen).  There was also absolutely no sound.   I tracked the object for about two minutes until our trees got in the way.;40.3356;-79.6185
