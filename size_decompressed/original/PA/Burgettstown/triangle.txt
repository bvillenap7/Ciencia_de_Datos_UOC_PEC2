triangular ufo over burgettstown,pa;1996-05-21 01:00:00;3 minutes;triangular ufo over burgettstown,pa Well,it was a warm summer night and I had just gotten home from work and was outside on the front deck having a cigarette when I looked up an saw it.  It was about  40 feet above the roof of the 2 story house I was living in at the time.I can only assume the color was black as it was around 1 am.the shape was triangular with circular lights at the corners and a row of  8 square lights arranged in a rectangle near the center of the craft.It moved very slowly  across the valley,making absolutely  no noise at all and had no rush of air ahead or behind like an airplane would. It moved so slowly it almost seemed to stop a few times.  When it got to the top of the facing hill about ½ mile or so it just vanished. I couldn’t tell you with any real certainty if anyone else saw it, but,it is possible as it flew directly overhead of a populated area next to a molybdenum  refinery.  I feel good about my estimates on the distances because I am a construction worker and am q! uite accustomed to sight gauging lengths and distances.  From front to back it appeared to be about 100 feet long and at it’s widest point  I would say about 40 - 50 feet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.3813;-80.4052
