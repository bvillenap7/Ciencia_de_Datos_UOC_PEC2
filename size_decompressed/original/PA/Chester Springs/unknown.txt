Cross-hair type lights seen floating then changing colors until out of view.;2014-06-14 22:00:00;5 minutes;Cross-hair type lights seen floating then changing colors until out of view. My county was having a block party so fireworks were in order at the end of the night.  My house is close to the fireworks and up higher from where they were being set off so we could see them from our house.   It was me, my brother, and my dad for the first few minutes watching the fireworks.  After a while I started to get bored with them and ended up looking to the right in the sky.  Immediately I saw a weird dot that seemed to be made up of different colors.  I told my dad and brother and they saw it too.   At this moment it was just staying in a single place, not moving left right up or down.  After a couple minutes my dad ran in the house to get my mom and a pair of binoculars.  He came out with the binoculars and we each took turns looking through them.  It gave instant clarity to what we were looking at.   What I saw was four separate lights shaped in lines unfortunately I couldnâ€™t make out a shape, only the lights.  If I were to guess I would say that it was a d! isk.  They almost looked like a crosshair in the sky with each line being a different color.  It was hard for me to see the colors but what I could make out was white, red, green, yellow/orange.  The thing is though is that at least one of them changed colors because I know I saw blue/purple at one point.   After another couple minutes using the binoculars my mom came out.  I had the binoculars at this point and almost right after my mom came out the colors starting slowly spinning.  I stopped looking through the binoculars and saw that not only did it start spinning but it also went from multiple colors to all white, then all red.   As it was doing this it started moving down and to the right until we lost sight of it behind a tree.;40.0978;-75.6398
