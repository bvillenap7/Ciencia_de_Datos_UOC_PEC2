Observed in the near sky what appeared to be a fireball followed by another fireball then another fireball. Then when my wife pointed it out i was sure it was unusual.  I started recording this on my cell phone.we noticed that there was zero sound or vibrations from the objects.  They seemed to be flying  from the left to the right in what appeared to be a planned route.  I later super slow motioned frame shot from the video and produced a still images  to what i truly believe was not from this world.  They appeared to be circular shape objects.  One still appears to have  some sort of windows or something;40.1794;-75.1107
