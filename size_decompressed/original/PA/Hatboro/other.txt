When i looked up to see the stars I noticed a craft  gliding overhead.  I immediatly opened the back door and yelled for people to come see and to hurry.  The only person to get out there in time to see it was my son. What i saw was what i would call a crescent shaped object, gliding or flying in the direction of the wind  at the time. There was no sound , no lights. The only light was what was reflecting off the craft from the streetlights and such on the ground. This happened near the intersection of county line rd and rte.309. This is a heavy populated area. There has to be other people that saw this thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
