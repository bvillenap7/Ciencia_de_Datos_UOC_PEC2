We looked up and saw what appeared to be a fireball moving fast towards the south.  We thought it was a meteor until it seemed to climb, then disappear.;41.2311;-80.5004
Four red/orange fireballs seen over sharon/farrell pa materializing and disapearing;2015-07-04 21:22:00;1 hour;Four red/orange fireballs seen over sharon/farrell pa materializing and disapearing On July fourth, 2015, at 9:22 pm, I witnessed four red/orange fireballs facing south southeast in Sharon, PA.  They appeared climbing high in the sky as the were on fire, they flickered like a flame.  They were the size of a large star, maybe a bit bigger.   Some would appear as they were flying fast, and some would just materialize in the sky.  In my opinion they were not fire works because the fireballs would hover for several minutes and also move left to right and up and down.   The fireball UFOs would also fly away super fast and some just disappear.  https://youtu.be/ako2KbxeI74;41.2311;-80.5004
