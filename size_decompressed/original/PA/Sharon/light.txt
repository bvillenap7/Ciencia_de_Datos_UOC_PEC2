Round white light speeding over us then just disappearing.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS??  PD));2009-05-25 09:45:00;90 seconds;Round white light speeding over us then just disappearing. I was outside by the fire with four friends when someone noticed a light in the sky.  It was circular and very bright.  It started out in the northern sky, moved south, and then east until it just disappeared. It stayed very bright until its disappearance.  It seemed to be moving incredibly fast, with no discernable flight pattern.;41.2311;-80.5004
An orangeish-red hovering light appeared, disappeared, reappeared, then faded away into the sky.;2015-09-06 20:30:00;20 minutes;An orangeish-red hovering light appeared, disappeared, reappeared, then faded away into the sky. I was driving in my car and as I was moving toward the south I noticed an orangeish-red light in the sky.  There were several stars visible already, and this was quite a bit larger.  It was about a quarter the size of a full moon.  At first, I considered it to be a helicopter or an aircraft, yet it didn't move, it just hovered.  I watched it as I drove for about three minutes.  When I got to a stop sign, I took a picture with my phone and waited there for a minute. There were others walking on the street who were pointing to it.  I turned east and could no longer see it and about two minutes later asked my husband to come get in the car.  We drove around for about five minutes trying to find it but it was gone. As we were walking in the house, again we noticed it in the sky.  Behind it were light clouds.  I had to take my son in to get him to sleep, and my husband watched it for about five minutes until he saw that it had disappeared. I went outside about ten minutes later and walked around and eventually it reappeared again.  It was in a different position in the sky but still was not moving.  I called a neighbor and waited for him to arrive, and after glowing in the sky, it slowly faded smaller and smaller until it was no longer observable. It did not flicker, blink, nor move.  It was a hazy-type light.  As I walked around with the neighbor again to see if we could spot it, another neighbor arrived and said that he, too, had seen it.;41.2311;-80.5004
A strange orange light seen in the night sky.;2015-09-06 20:40:00;1 minute;A strange orange light seen in the night sky. Well, I went outside because my wife told me she had seen a strange light in the sky.  We traveled for several minutes trying to observe it.   When we were reentering the house, it was in the sky and I spotted it.  I was facing west. What I saw seemed like a small ball of gas rolling across the sky.  It was orange and larger than a star.  It was about an 8th of the size of the full moon.  It appeared to flicker.  It seemed like a ball of gas burning and seemed to roll.;41.2311;-80.5004
