Red/orange fireball moving slowly;2012-07-04 21:45:00;5 minutes;Red/orange fireball moving slowly On Independence Day 2012 at 9:45 pm i was sitting on the roof of the garage with my fiance and his parents about to watch the fireworks.  I saw a large reddish-orange fireball moving very slowly to the northeast, without any sound.  After about 5 minutes it disappeared. There are hot air balloons in the area that travel short distances.  However, this was well after dark, and i have never seen any hot air balloons in the area past dusk (it was dark enough to see the stars by this point, and fireworks started within the same time frame). Also every time i've seen hot air balloons they have been accompanied by loud rushing/roaring noises from the flame and gas burner. I have yet to see if any hot air balloons might have been up at that time of night, in that specific area.;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148

While waiting for fireworks to start we saw an orange ball move across the sky towards the north at a rapid speed.  It slowed almost to a stop and shifted east.  It then disappeared.  It was a blurry orange ball with no flashing lights or any other visible markings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
