Huge, intense bright white light that changed in size and direction, accompanied by 5 others.;2000-10-29 19:40:00;1 hour;Huge, intense bright white light that changed in size and direction, accompanied by 5 others. Observed a very bright shining light to the east of the setting moon. Sky was mixture of clear and very high clouds. The light was very noticeable and began to move from southwest to southeast at a very slow pace. Appeared to be very high, perhaps 10,000ft. Slowly dropped down to about 2,000ft, remaining extremely bright intense white light, then dimming to a tiny pin point of light, then getting extremely bright again. I got into my car and drove to a friends' house approximately 6 miles southeast of my location, hurried in to tell her to come out and see it. When we went out, there it was, with 5 other ones, that were drifting down and hovering over the tree lined hills to our immediate south. We watched them move down under the tree light and observed them disappear and appear quite some distance away to the southwest. No sound, except that of a commercial jetliner heading northeast over us. We went in because it was getting too cold and windy outside. When I was driving up to her place, my radio was picking up a lot of static which is unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot be certain what the witness observed, but we do observe that the report is not inconsistent with a twinkling star.  However, that is only a guess.  UFO's generally do not remain visible in one location for an hour, and there were no other reports from this part of the country.  PD));40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148
Appeared to be a slow moving shooting star.;2014-09-27 04:30:00;6 seconds;Appeared to be a slow moving shooting star. A coworker and I were outside smoking a cigarette on third shift. Mid-conversation I noticed what appeared to be a very slow moving shooting star.  I saw it for about three seconds before I said ((deleted)) look! and pointed to it out to my coworker. It was not an airplane, satellite, or shooting star. The only way I can describe it is to say it was like watching a shooting star in slow motion.;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148

It was distinguishable from a star in that it was of a greenish tint and seemed to look almost like two stars stuck together.  I kept watching it as it moved at a steady speed when I noticed 3 more trailing it, all going at the same speed. They were steady in there speed.  They covered the horizon in about a minute.  As I trailed them I noticed more in different parts of the sky, all moving in the NW to NE direction.  I ran inside to grab my binoculars and when I looked up they were too high to make out and seemed very shaky.  I saw more coming from the same direction, and from the opposite direction the sky filled with instant cloud cover.  They all seemed to be travelling through the clouds. I ran in to grab my wife, and we watched for the next 10 minutes as they came through.  They seemed to travel in 3 or 4 and they all had the same look of! 2 stars stuck together, with a greenish tint.  There had to be 30 or 40 in all.  They were very high up. No sound at all. We did see a few planes during this.  The phenomena stopped and the clouds were gone. I've never seen a UFO.  I don't believe in UFO's quite frankly.  It was the most bizarre thing I've ever seen. I live within 3 miles of the Limerick Nuclear Power Plant.  We have two airports in the vicinity.  I skywatch constantly and have never seen anything like this.;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148
