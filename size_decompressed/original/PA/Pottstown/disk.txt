I was observing the night sky from a hill in Berks County, west of Pottstown. Above the Limerick Nuclear Power Plant, I saw a disc shaped object moving slowly and silently from south to north across the sky. The sky was clear. The object appeared to be at approximately 700ft. From my point of view, it appeared about 1/2 inch across, and I was 6 miles from the power plant. I used binoculars and could see the object appeared transparent and glassy around the entire surface, with bright lights, blue, white, red and orange, flashing across the center of the object. I also observed another, tiny white flashing light below and to the north of the object, traveling near it. I observed the disc until it was no longer in my field of vision.;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148
