Multiple unknown orange lights flying silently at night, followed by aircraft.;2013-11-01 19:15:00;2 minutes;Multiple unknown orange lights flying silently at night, followed by aircraft. Just around 7 pm my boyfriend hurried me outside, and when I looked up I saw three orange balls of light lined up together perfectly in a curved line.  These lights hovered in the air for about a minute.  Then, all three lights moved simultaneously, silently.  The lights looked very close, almost over the house out back of ours.   As these 3 lights moved northwest, and eventually disappeared. About 6 or 7 single orange lights appeared over the tree line, following the first three.  All of the trailing lights also moved silently.   With all of these lights, multiple dogs in the area started barking and didn't stop until they were out of sight.   As these lights moved out of sight about 10-15 airplanes starting appearing over the horizon, following the mysterious lights, along with a few helicopters.  The airplanes and helicopters stayed in sight for the next 45 minutes.;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148
Formation of UFOs, back and forth at high altitude.;2020-12-17 18:58:00;2 hours;Formation of UFOs, back and forth at high altitude. Over our home in Pottstown, I saw this triangle shaped formation far up in the sky. It wasn't very lit up. At first I thought it's bird's or a cloud. Then it happened again, coming the other way, then again, but they would form a line or go into a circular type shape. This went on for hours, back and forth, high in the sky. My videos and pictures are terrible. Even with my high zoom mirror less camera;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148
