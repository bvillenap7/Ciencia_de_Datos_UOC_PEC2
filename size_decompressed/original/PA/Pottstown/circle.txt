It was going straight up, not on a slant like airplanes, and I called all the airports in my area there were no airplanes out at that time. When the UFO was over my house my tvs went crazy then as soon as it was gone they were back to normal.

Late afternoon saw a small cloud.  It just looked different, whiter/brighter.  ((anonymous report));2016-11-15 17:00:00;5 minutes;Late afternoon saw a small cloud.  It just looked different, whiter/brighter.  It looked like 3 Q-tips formed like a club from a card deck. As I was looking at it, it was not moving at all.  Then it shot off at a speed I've never seen. Anyone see something similar? ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date.
