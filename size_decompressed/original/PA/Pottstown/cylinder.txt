reflective white tube  flying 100 ft or so under passenger plane during daylight.;2003-04-30 13:20:00;30 seconds;reflective white tube  flying 100 ft or so under passenger plane during daylight. Driving 422 West in afternoon. Noticed passenger jet in sky, had red and white paint  with white words. This caught my attention, as it seemed lower than usual. Stopped my car in middle of intersection when i saw sunlight glint moving underneath jet, about 100 ft underneath. reflection followed exactly with jet but was 1/5th the size. Best I can say it was either a steel pipe shape or tube. Absolutly stunning, it moved with jet perfectly timed but definetly an object,as it moved it stopped reflecting sun, and I saw it had white color then it faded away. Cars honking behind me made me move. Pulled into parking lot of diner and looked back, could see passenger jet but not object. I watched for about 30 seconds. Broad daylight, great visibility that day. I would not be suprised if someone on that flight saw something. I almost don't believe this was real, but I stared again and again in that time to try and make out more, but it was mostly a bright reflection, like shiny metal. However the object seemed white when the reflection of the sun died down. About the size of a automobile in relation to jet.;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148
the object was to low to be a jet and to quiet.;2009-07-09 23:45:00;3 to 5 mins;the object was to low to be a jet and to quiet. 07/9/09 -11:35 Pottstown Pennsylvania I , and  my friend were on the front porch holding a conversation when I looked up wered in the the night sky, then I noticed an object UFO  hovering above the Limerick power plant which I can see from my house. At first glance I belived it was a plane but I thought to myself a plane does not hover how this was. So I said to my friend do you see how that UFO is just stuck hovering above the power plant. At that time he said yes. the the object started moving towards or direction, slow at first then increased speed as it neared. then at that time I stepped of my porch and looked above as it passed the object UFO had six lights the front there were yellow and one light was red the the two after that were also yellow. the lights were in a straight line, and behind the object UFO were a sequence/series yellow strips of what seemed to be beams. The Object UFO  was a straight craft like a cylinder shape. then the Object Just increased speed once again and then seem to just disappear to no were in three night sky. Then my cell phone was cutting on and off.;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148
