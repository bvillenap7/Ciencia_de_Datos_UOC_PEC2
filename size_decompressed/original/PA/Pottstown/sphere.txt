Spheres just appeared and then after a minute or two, blinked out. One appeared again in a location over the Limerick Power Plant. My friend and I decided to sky-surf--to watch for fireworks, beginning on the 4th of July. We observed two big orange spheres that appeared out of no where over Pottstown, high above the the airport. We had a very expensive Canon 35mm camera, and right when I focused on the spheres to take the shot, they disappeared. We watched for them to come back, but no luck. On 7/7 and 7/8, we went sky-surfing again, and about 10pm, we saw the spheres again, but very much higher and very bright. Again, we wanted to snap a picture, and they blinked out. We will send;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148
Extremely fast round metallic object with very erractic turns as it ascended.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island.  PD);2006-12-16 07:00:00;3 min.;Extremely fast round metallic object with very erractic turns as it ascended. Was a clear morning sky. We were westbound going to meet freinds to go golfing. As we approached Reading,Pa. we noticed a vapor trail that appeared to be vertical to approx. 15,ooo ft than appeared to take a 90 degree turn to the west. The vapor trail was straight up and down but the horizontal vapor trail changed direction several times in an erractic succession. Upon meeting our freinds they were baffled as to what they saw. They asked us if we saw the vapor trail. They were much closer to it than we were, in fact they were transferring golf clubs into another car in a parking lot when they saw what they described as a small round object launch extremely fast , as a rocket would launch, vertically.It than seemed to drop back towards them at which time it again rose very rapidly and than turned on a dime toward the west and quickly disappeared to the west. They described it as a round metallic object that was very hard to see due to its extreme speed. What was apparent was its vapor trail off of both sides of it. They also said it was extremely silent. The desciption of their sighting was exactly what we saw from approx. 10 miles away. We were hoping that someone else also had this sighting, as it was very strange indeed.What bothers me is when something this apparent is not publicized ,it seems others must have seen it also. I have never seen anything like it nor would I ever imagine ever witnessing anything so surreal. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.  PD));40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148

Two Sphere's Near Limerick Power Plant;2011-08-12 00:00:00;30 seconds;Two Sphere's Near Limerick Power Plant Tonight I was walking inside when I saw two red spheres, flying from the Limerick power plant. As they were making their way toward me, I noticed no sound was being made from the two spheres.  Eventually the first sphere’s light went out as they got closer to me.  Then the second went out.  They were traveling so slowly that it couldn’t be a plane or helicopter.   Also it made no noise what so ever.  I have planes/helicopters fly over me constantly and they make lots of noise.  I am not sure what this was.;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148
Fire colored sphere in Pottstown.;2012-07-04 21:50:00;3 minutes;Fire colored sphere in Pottstown. On July 4th we were parking  in Pottstown, in an alley, behind a friends house.  The alley is in between 4th and 5th streets.  Our friends met my fiancé and I in the alley as we were getting out of our car.  Our one friend looked up and said “what is that?   What the hell is that”.    We all saw a sphere shaped object that looked to us to be about 500 feet above the ground.  The object was almost right above us.  The sphere was glowing bright orange , the color of fire.  There was no noise and there were no blinking lights like on an aircraft.   The object was moving in a straight line with a slight hesitation at times along it’s path.   The sphere was moving from West to East.   The object stayed in our sight for about 3 minutes until we lost sight of it.;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148
