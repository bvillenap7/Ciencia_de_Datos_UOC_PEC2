white, cigar shaped unidentified flying object over Pottstown, Pa.;2001-06-17 19:40:00;10 minutes;white, cigar shaped unidentified flying object over Pottstown, Pa. I was sitting on my back porch facing south. I observed a small plane. It was flying northeasterly. Then I noticed a cigar shaped craft. It appeared white and was as long as a dime is wide when held at arms length. It did not make any sound or change color. It appeared to move very slowly from west to east, and I observed it for about 10 minutes, under a very clear sky. I have never seen anything like it in my life, and I am a clean, sober, mature 46 year old man. I would like to know if anyone else has seen it, because it was very visible.;40.2442703703704;-75.6281148148148
