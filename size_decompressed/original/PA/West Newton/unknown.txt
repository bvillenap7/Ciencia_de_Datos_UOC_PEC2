Noticed what appeared to be a hovering helicopter with red, blue, green, yellow flashing lights, but was quite some distance into sky.  Was able to see better with binoculars.  Hovering as I write this.  Has been still in air for at least an hour now.  Lights just keep flashing.  Noticed four others around it but they seem much further away.;40.2023;-79.7588
