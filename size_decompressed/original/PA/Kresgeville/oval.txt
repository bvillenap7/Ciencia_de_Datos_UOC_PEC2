Oval light source and hazy conical beam of light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 21:00:00;30 second;Oval light source and hazy conical beam of light. Oval light source, stationary, projecting a hazy conical beam that didn't reach the ground. Looked like a spotlight (at first we thought it might be a helicopter searchlight), but it was stationary and seemed to be close enough that we would have heard an aircraft engine (there was no sound). After about 30 seconds, the light disappeared, but the hazy beam stayed visible for a few more seconds. Wierdest thing is the haze looked like it was passing through fog, but it was a crystal clear night, not a cloud in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.8983;-75.5038
