Strange object seen in Saylorsburg, PA skies.;2008-09-23 17:00:00;10 seconds;Strange object seen in Saylorsburg, PA skies. When I arrived home from work today, my eleven year old daughter said that she saw a satellite in the sky at about 5pm.  I told her that you cannot see satellites in the sky during the daytime, so please elaborate a little. She proceeded to tell me that she was in her room and heard a wallowing like sound outside her window.  She looked out and saw what she described as a satellite looking object slowly moving from south to north.  She said the object was black and white and traveled just above the tree line.  She did not notice any lights. She drew me a picture of what she saw.  It was a round orb in the center with two rectangular panels connected to each side.  From the bottom hung a larger panel-like structure. She called my wife to come look, but when my wife got there it was gone.;40.8925;-75.367
