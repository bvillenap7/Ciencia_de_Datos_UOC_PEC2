At approximately 9:45 p.m EST on 11/8/13, in Phoenixville PA, I was walking across the Gay Street Bridge when I saw a bright orange object floating in the air.  It was about 20 feet above the bridge and was moving slowly and horizontally.  It was rectangular and looked to be about two feet high and a foot wide.    There was a very bright light inside the object, like a lit candle, giving the object an orange glow.  Although the light was like a flame, the object wasn't on fire and there was no smoke. I saw it most clearly when it passed nearby a street lamp.   There was a fairly strong breeze, but the object wasn't affected by it.  It moved steadily in a lateral direction for another few hundred yards, passing over and above the creek and toward the downtown area.  It then gradually moved upward in a diagonal direction until it seemed be several hundred feet high.  When it was about a quarter of a mile away, I began to lose sight of it, but the light was still as bright as a star.;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
