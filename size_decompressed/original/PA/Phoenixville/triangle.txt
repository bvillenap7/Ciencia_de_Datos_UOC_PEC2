Light along the sides with a shape of a triangle;2004-12-28 21:00:00;20 mins;Light along the sides with a shape of a triangle around 22:00 yself and a friend where driveing when we noticed three objects circling something which we wherent sure of. The object must have been 500 to 1000 feet above the ground. as we came closer we thought they where helicopters but there was two light which looked to be parallel to each other. one passed over and we thought it to be a double bladed helicopter. we stop and listen and there was no sound what so ever. So we thought it was alittle strang but drove on as we came in to the two itsself we saw another object which was the same as the other one which we have seen. this time I saw the shape of a triangle and about three lights on either side. it was moving slower then a plane and seemed slower movie then a helicopter, and this object also made no noise. after about 5 mins it flew off. Each object left in different directions. about ten minutes later my friend noticed three jets flying in the direction of the objects that we had seen.;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
Pa. Triangular shape hovering  50ft with two steady lights in front, multiple blinking lights on sides and bottom and visible 5-7 min;2021-06-09 21:46:00;5-7 minuets;Pa. Triangular shape hovering  50ft with two steady lights in front, multiple blinking lights on sides and bottom and visible 5-7 min On June 9th at approximately 9:46 pm we spotted an unusual aircraft hovering at about 50 ft in the air.  This object was slowly rising straight up in the air. This object had 2 lights in what appeared to be the front of it and multiple lights on the sides and multiple lights on the bottom. The two lights were a steady white light but the lights on the bottom and sides were blinking.  This object appeared to be an oval shape but as it flew over top of us it appeared to be more of a triangular shape.  This object was very loud.  This object made what appeared to be several zig zag movements. It appeared to speed up at times and then slow down.  This object was spotted over Morris Cemetery in Phoenixville and flew in the direction of Philadelphia.  This is not the first time this object was spotted by us. We took a video of this object.;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
