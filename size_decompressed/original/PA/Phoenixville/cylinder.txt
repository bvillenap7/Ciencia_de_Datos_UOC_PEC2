Outwalking and looked up to see contrail.  A tic tac object white without wings was making this.  I watched it go for a few seconds heading EAST.   I then saw another tictac white without wings coming WEST at the same elevation and about 100 feet from the first object. They passed each other as on a two lane highway.  Second tic tac did not make contrail.  They were higher than the passenger aircraft coming from Phila. airport in the East which flew under them both about 2000 feet lower. Tic tac going west caught the sun's rays and it appeared to glint off several windows going the length of it. No noise was heard.;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
