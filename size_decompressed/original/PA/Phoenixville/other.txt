On the night of 9-12-20 at 2020hrs, I witnessed an orange dim glowing arura/haze object flying through the sky extremely fast, which made many straight and zigzag formations, that had stops before moving onto a new flight pattern. Before I seen what, I mentioned above, I saw a bright white object that was bright, and it went dark. This object was stationary. I thought it was a solar flare, satellite, or space junk.  It was none of the above. As I saw this, I looked straight up looking for anything else that was flying around. At this moment, I saw this orange aura/haze object fly from the North East to the North West.  As it flew it made an extremely fast straight line, fastest thing I have ever seen, then came to an amazingly fast stop. Then made another fast movement from its stopped position and went to the right. It was flying all over the sky. It continued to do these extremely fast flight patterns for a duration of 20 seconds. I was the only witness to this. The constellations this object flew from what I could see on my end were, Lacerta, Cygnus, Draco, Hercules, Lyra, Corona Borealis, Canesuenatiei and Bootes. The direction it ultimately flew to was, 311 degrees North West. My location is: Lat 40.119488-degree North and Lon -75.512198-degree West. The weather this night, the sky was clear with no clouds or upper level haze.;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
