At this point the camera was zoomed out from what was happening and then paned over to the left and i lost track of the object. this sighting lasted 3 to 6 secounds ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on a number of occasions, and he sounds sincere and credible to us.  However, predicated on this report, Jeff Challender, noted follower of the NASA television broadcasts from U. S. space platforms, arranged to have the tape scanned for the time indicated.  Nothing was found, and we cannot confirm that live feeds were being broadcast from the Space Shuttle, Columbia, at the time of the alleged sighting, even though the shuttle had been launched on January 16, the day of the event.

2 smoky orbs appear and disappear in early morning sky.;2014-08-28 05:45:00;1 minute;2 smoky orbs appear and disappear in early morning sky I can't say it was a craft, but I was looking at the constellation Orion while walking my dog in the dark around 5 a.m..  Later in the walk I looked again at Orion and saw to the right what looked like the moon behind a cloud but it had a red tint and it glowed bright and then seemed to disippate.  I could see the remains of the cloud against the dark sky.   I walked a few more steps and noticed another one to the right of where the first was, this had a blue tint and also appeared quickly and then dissipated.  There was no movement other than appearing and disappearing, so not really a flying object, but I defintely can't find an explanation.  My dog couldn't have cared less.  I stopped to stare and she was tugging the leash to keep walking.;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
