I see these on occasion while on deck watching for shooting stars. Bare eye observation. I'm a housewife and a bit of a nightowl...no drugs used. this is my first report. I also see quick moving dark shadows on occasion. I observe sky approximately 3 nights per month.  I will report from now on! This white hazy object was not my imagination. Could it just be man made? Was very large and distant. Responses anyone?;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
