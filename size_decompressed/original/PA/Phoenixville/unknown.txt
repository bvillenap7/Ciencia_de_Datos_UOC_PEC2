While searching the sky to try to catch a glimpse of shooting stars, I saw a bright object, that looked like any other star, traversing the sky from north to south.  The object appeard to be blue - small - and very high.  What attracted my attention was the fact that the object was not showing signs of a commercial craft as it was not on the normal course that commercial flights take into Philladelphia, the blue light was not pulsating but was instead constant.  Also, at one point in it's progress, the object stopped and remained unmoving for a period of perhaps 8 - 10 seconds before continuing.  Soon after, it could no longer be seen, I assume due to the presence of pollution in the air or indirect light sources on the ground. I would just like to know what this object was / is.  I have not seen anything like this since I was a kid watching for Sputnick in the late 50's.  I never watch the sky, have little interest in stars and the only reason I was watching tonight was because I heard that meteor showers could perhaps be seen.;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
Bright light in the sky over Phoenixville;2013-08-05 00:00:00;30-60 seconds;Bright light in the sky over Phoenixville My husband, my brother, and I were sitting on my front porch sometime between 11 and midnight. My husband called our attention to a light in the sky, that appeared to be a plane.  When I first looked it was not moving.  Suddenly it moved quickly to the left and changed from white to red and green.  Then it went kind of back and forth very fast.  Next it moved left and higher before rapidly descending straight down. Now, I often watch the sky... I've never seen anything move like this.  It seemedmuch too high to have been some sort of toy.  My husband says a toy could't work that high in the sky. I never thought I'd make a report like this.  I've been checking the web to see if anyone else reported anything strange that night.  As I haven't seen anything, maybe submitting this will help me find out what the light was.;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
Observed strange object in night sky three evenings in a row, flying in zigzag pattern, hovering then retreating.;2013-08-17 20:43:00;5 minutes;Observed strange object in night sky three evenings in a row, flying in zigzag pattern, hovering then retreating. This is the third evening in a row that we observed this object.  A light approached from the north, and as it got closer to us we observed that it had four lights, two red on one side, two green on the other forming a square of lights.   The object moved toward us, hovered above us for several minutes, then retreated.  Its movement was not in a straight line.  It approached in a straight line, but then moved off in somewhat of a zigzag, and then moved put of sight.   The first evening (8/15) we heard a buzzing sound, but did not hear it the next two nights.  On the first evening, a large low flying military plane and a military helicopter arrived at the same location a few minutes after the object was gone.   Timing for the previous evenings: 8/15/2013= 21:45 8/16/2013= 21:45.;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
