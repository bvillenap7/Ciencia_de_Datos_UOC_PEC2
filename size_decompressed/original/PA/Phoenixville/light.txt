i was leaving my buddys house walking to my car and i looked to the horizon and saw 4 flickering glowing orbs going in and out of focus;2011-05-10 21:30:00;10 min;i was leaving my buddys house walking to my car and i looked to the horizon and saw 4 flickering glowing orbs going in and out of focus, one was bigger and brighter than the others and a little further away from the other 3...moving in abnormal ways..i ran in and got my friends to look too,they all got aligned in the sky then faded out..  iv seen this before about a year ago as well and there were more of them. i feel like the majority of sightings are these glowing orbs or balls of light working together and creating some sort of energy and thats why they flicker from the energy pulsating through them...

Orange-red lights in the sky in Phoenixville, PA;2012-06-02 21:25:00;3 minutes +;Orange-red lights in the sky in Phoenixville, PA I was driving home at approximately 21:25 on route 724 in Phoenixville, PA when I saw a strange formation in the sky.  I saw what looked to be a diamond formation in the sky of approximately 5-6 orange-red colored lights.  Since I was driving, I could not get a clear uninterrupted look for more than a few seconds - but I kept looking up trying to determine if they were aircraft, hot air balloons, etc. As I continued driving, I lost view of the diamond formation group of lights, but then saw a lower orange- red light that seemed to be moving across the sky at a steady pace with no blinking lights.  I passed a person on the side of the road that got out of her vehicle and was looking up in the sky at the direction if the object. As I continued to drive I kept looking at the object out of my driver side window.  It seemed to be staying at the same distance  while I was driving - keeping  the view constant.   I had a person driving fast behind me and I couldn't slow down to get a better look.   I wish I did pull over to get a better look, as I had my camera with me (coming home from an event) and I kept trying to process what I was seeing. This sparked my search this morning on the Internet to see if anyone else saw something strange in the sky last night.  I'm glad I wasn't the only one that saw something that was a little different than usual.;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
