They all flew in one direction, cut across left above my work building into the night sky. within 10-15 minutes, the sky was SWARMING with helicopters and airplanes and TONS of our own flying machines.  Every dog on the block was barking, HOWLING, for at least 20 minutes while these things flew by. And around 745 is when I saw the last one, diagonal from my office, right above a church, well, not RIGHT above like the one that flew literally 50 feet over my head, but a little ways above the roof of the church, and has sat still to this moment (806p) and is SLOWLY rising higher into the sky. I would say in the time it has SAT there, it has only moved upwards about 300 feet. AND it's blinking purple and pink. My mother, aunt, and cousin drove to my work and were also witness to the last one floating in the sky.;40.1262;-75.5267999999999
