it was a bright electrical blue rectangle that moved in a triangle.;2002-02-24 23:00:00;2 hours;it was a bright electrical blue rectangle that moved in a triangle. the craft or ufo the 3 of us saw was a rectangle shape. it was a perfect rectangle. It looked really bright. at first we thought it was green when we were sitting in our car and seen that it was moving in kind of a triangle shape then it would dissapear and then a few seconds like mybe 30 seconds would go by and it would come back. we got our telescope out and was looking at it and it was like a rectangle with a clear but shadow lin very thin running in the middle of it. on the right side it was like dots connected together with a bright electrical blue color. and on the left side it was like three thick shadow like lines connected together. it would sit there like that for a bit then all of a sudden the right side the electrical lines would fade and the shadow like lines on the left ould start movingg in different directions kinda slowly all over the figure with a strange pace to it. and then it would dissapear and come back.and the thing would do the same thing over again.but as we were watching this there was another craft that came along on the right side of us and it looked like a plane at first but it was really low to the ground and did not make as much noise as a plane and there were no blinking lights on it and the lights looked real bright like it was nothing but one big light that never blinked or flickered. ((NUFORC Note:  The first possible explanation of the sighting to be ruled out, we believe, would be some kind of celestial body.  It is rare to see a UFO for 2 hours.
