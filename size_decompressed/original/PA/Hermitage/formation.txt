A loud, sideways triangle, with many lights.;2009-10-04 02:15:00;2 mins;A loud, sideways triangle, with many lights. I was watching TV in bed at 2:15ish AM, when I heard a loud helicopter like noise, It was so loud, it made be decide to get out of bed and look out my window. When i looked out, i seen a very low object with a bright white light (non blinking) and a red (blinking light) fly diagonally in my view. I tried to rationalize this saying this has to be a helicopter. But i noticed as it started to fly out of sight. a few more lights came on, at this point i started to shake, because it became startling. Therefor i cant say for sure how many lights came on, i would say 4 would be the best answer. i remember 2 of them were red and the other ones were white, a few of them were blinking. The best way to explain this sight would be a triangle flying on its side. Could this be a new government craft?, I don't know. But I know what i saw, and it wasn't anything that I'm used to seeing.;41.2307000000001;-80.4539000000004

I looked up to see if the sky was cloud covered because I was concerned about frost.It was dark and barely any stars shown.  So I noticed what at first looked like a cluster of stars, but it seemed to be a formation of white lines shaped like an asterisk.  Checking the sky further I saw 3 more of the same asterisk shape.  Nothing was moving and it seemed odd to me that there would be 4 of these in a sort of grid pattern spaced out straight up in the sky.  There was no flashing or movement during the short time I watched.  The asterisk was elongated with extra arms eminating from the center, more like a double asterisk lighted with white light.  They were in 2 rows evenly spaced and staggered.;41.2307000000001;-80.4539000000004
