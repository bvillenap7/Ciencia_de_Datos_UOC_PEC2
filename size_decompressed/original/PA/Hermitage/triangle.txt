They were sitting at a picnic table and I was standing.  I was talking when I looked up, and in the opening between two trees(40 feet), I saw something fly overhead. I said what the **** is that? I quickly turned and took a few steps to my left and watched the object disappear into the night sky.  While I was watching my friends had got up from the table.  The one was standing behind me and said Did you see that?  What the hell was it? The other friend didn't see anything but could tell that we definately did.  We discussed what we saw and each drew pictures of what we saw.  We saw the same thing.  First of all the object was completely silent. It did not appear to be flying at an altitude greater than a couple hundred feet.  It was again absolutly silent. It was moving but not at a tremendous amount of speed.  Traveling west to east and moved laterally to our right before disappearing. It did not bank(like a plane would)it swiftly moved to the right.  I cannot make a fair call on how large it was and whether or not I was seeing the back of it or the bottom of it.  But what I saw consisted of three rectangular lights, goldish-amber in color, not terribly bright, but distinct--no halos or blurriness to them(it was a little hazy that night too) The rectangles were in a triangular pattern, one on top, two on the bottom, as if there was one for each point on a triangle. Whatever it was DID NOT make a sound.;41.2307000000001;-80.4539000000004
Triangular, two white lights one blinking red in center, came from west and turned south;2014-05-15 22:25:00;1 minute;Triangular, two white lights one blinking red in center, came from west and turned south Triangular shaped object with two white lights and one blinking red light in center came from the west very low and slow-moving.   The lights turned south and dipped just below the top of the tree line but still visible and seemed to straighten into a line.  It did not appear to be moving away at this point only changing shape (or perspective).   Remained stationary for about 40 seconds, at which point I reached behind me to grab the binoculars and when i turned back the lights had disappeared.
