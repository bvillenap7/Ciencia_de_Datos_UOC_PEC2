3 red fireballs in the Eastern sky near hermitage pa.;2013-08-09 21:00:00;3-5 minutes;3 red fireballs in the Eastern sky near hermitage pa. We saw 3 bright lights that appeared from the eastern sky.  The first two were fairly close to each other, the third appeared a few seconds later.  The first two were very bright red, as bright as fire.  The last one was bright red/yellow.  All were circular in shape.  It was evening so the sun was below the tree line in the west.  It was still somewhat light out.  2100 hrs.  The way they appeared in the sky over the tree line almost looked like they took off from the ground.  They didn't appear to be moving real fast but when I looked at the amount of ground they covered they had to be moving fast.  They traveled south probably three minutes.  They then turned east, that's when the lights faded and they disappeared.  They all traveled in the same path, so couldn't be lanterns that people talk about.  They looked fairly close to us, guessing 5-8 miles, but when they turned you could see they were very far away.  I think the lights were so bright it made them! look closer than they really were.  They almost looked like UFO's that you see in a movie.  My wife and kids were actually scared.  I don't believe they were satellites because I've seen them in the sky at dusk.  These were way lower and a thousand times brighter.  Guaranteed others saw them.  Very weird.;41.2307000000001;-80.4539000000004
