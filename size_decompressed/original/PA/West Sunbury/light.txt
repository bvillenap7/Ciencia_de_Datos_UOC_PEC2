BRIGHT LIGHT APPEARED ABOUT 200 FT IN AIR AND COVERED ME WITH A BRIGHT BEAM BEFORE STREAKING OFF OUT OF SIGHT;1997-08-15 23:30:00;30-45 SEC.;BRIGHT LIGHT APPEARED ABOUT 200 FT IN AIR AND COVERED ME WITH A BRIGHT BEAM BEFORE STREAKING OFF OUT OF SIGHT I WAS AT MY HORSE BARN CHECKING ON THINGS AND ADMIRING THE NIGHT SKY AND ALL OF ITS STARS WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A BRIGHT LIGHT CAME ON ABOUT 200 FT IN THE AIR, JUST IN FRONT OF ME AND OVER MY HORSE PADDOCK.I TRIED TO SEE ANY OBJECT BUT THE LIGHT WAS TOO BRIGHT AND I HAD TO COVER MY EYES WITH MY ARMS WHILE TRYING TO LOOK.I WAS COVERED BY THE BEAM LIKE A GIANT FLASHLIGHT WAS BEING SHINED ON ME.THERE WAS NO NOISE OR AIR MOVEMENT(WIND). I MOVED MY ARMS AND HANDS AROUND TO TRY TO BLOCK OUT THE LIGHT AND SEE WHAT WAS CAUSING IT,BUT I COULDN'T.I WAS FACING EAST.I THEN HEARD A LIGHT PLANE ENGINE COMING FROM BEHIND ME AND OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER.I LOOKED TO THE RIGHT AND SAW A PLANE COMING.IT WAS PRETTY HIGH UP BUT I COULD HEAR IT.I THOUGHT,WELL AT LEAST SOMEONE ELSE IS SEEING THIS TOO,  WHEN IT SUDDENLY STREAKED OFF TO THE NORTH LEAVING A STREAK OF LIGHT SHOWING ITS PATH.IT MOVED WAY TOO FAST FOR A PLANE AND MADE NO NOISE.I CAME DOWN THE HOUSE AND TOLD MY WIFE BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO TELL OR REPORT IT TO. I JUST CAME ACROSS YOUR WEB PAGE AND THOUGHT I WOULD LET YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH ITS BEEN ABOUT A YEAR AGO. PLEASE KEEP MY NAME, ETC. OUT OF THIS.I ONLY WANTED TO HELP YOU GATHER INFO.I DON'T WANT TO BE LABELED AS A NUT.THANK YOU;41.005;-79.872
