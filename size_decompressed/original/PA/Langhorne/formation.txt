3-4 lighted circles in the sky.;2012-04-16 22:30:00;20-30 minutes;3-4 lighted circles in the sky. Out walking my dog and looked up to the sky looking for Venus.  Heard on the news how bright it was.  Saw it, but also saw to the right of it the straight formation of circular lights, unmoving.  Thought at first they were stars but then aircraft (ours) flew around them and one disappeared in a blink!  Strange!  looked outside a few minutes ago and they are gone.;40.183;-74.9110000000001
