Shiny silver cigar shaped object  with no sound.;2007-09-02 19:00:00;1 minute;Shiny silver cigar shaped object  with no sound. We were having a Labor Day weekend barbecue. After we ate we decided to sit out in the backyard and just have some conversation. There were six of us there and we were discussing how low some of the planes were flying over heading to an airport near the Trenton, New Jersey area. We spotted a total of 4 airplanes fly over. They were flying west to east. All the airplanes were going along the same path to the west of where were sitting in the yard. Then we looked to the east of where we were sitting and we spotted a shiny silver cigar shaped object that was also flying west to east towards New Jersey. It was flying slower than the planes we had just seen, it seemed more like it was just floating. It didn't make any sound and didn't have any blinking lights like the planes did. The thing that was really strange was how shiny it was. It was a pretty clear day and the sun was getting ready to set but the sun's light was just beaming off of this object. Myself, and two others thought it was very strange. The other three people there just blew it off as nothing. Apparently they don't believe that there could be other life out there somewhere.;40.183;-74.9110000000001
