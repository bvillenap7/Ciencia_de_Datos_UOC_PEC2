To provide yet another description of a UFO that you mosy certainly had already heard I would more effectively offer that what I have learned from my unusual experience approx.  18 years ago. I was sure that what I was seeing was real when the Military came to visit a number of times.  If the truth is what your after please feel free to call.  If your stuck on the sterotype conclusion that the government wants us to beleive don't waist our time.  It's just a matter of time before the truth comes out so you must either go with the flow or eat some dust. I have concerns... maybe you work for the government after all?
