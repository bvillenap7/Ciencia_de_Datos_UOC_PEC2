Five yellow flying objects with tails.;2016-01-02 16:40:00;8 minutes;Five yellow flying objects with tails My husband and I were driving home on north 95 from Langhorne, PA. Low on the horizon, there were five orange/yellowish objects with glowing tails, like miniature comets in the sky.  They did not appear to be moving.   Three were clustered together and seemed pointed in the same direction.  Two others were farther down.  I checked my iPhone's compass app and saw they were exactly West.   It was around 4:40pm, just before dusk, but still enough daytime sun. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.183;-74.9110000000001
