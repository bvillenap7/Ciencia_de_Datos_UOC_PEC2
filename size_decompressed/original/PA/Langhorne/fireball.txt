Orange fireballs like objects.;2012-09-23 18:55:00;20-25 minutes;orange fireballs like objects. On September 23 at around 6:55 p.m. I saw what seemed like a UFO. I saw three moving in formation.  All of them were definitely moving downward.  I saw an orange flame like thing on the back and a white orb on the front.  Not all had orbs. Just two.   We were traveling West on US route 1 in Langhorne, Bucks County PA.  We saw the UFOs in the Western sky traveling south.  Viewing it from the horizon the lowest UFO was about sixty degrees above the horizon.  The second was about eighty degrees above the horizon.   The third was about one-hundred degrees.   About 5 minutes later we saw about 10 or more fighter jets fly towards the objects, and yes I am sure they were fighter jets.  As we continued driving, at around 7:01 we saw a fourth UFO.  The fourth UFO seemed bigger than the others.  It was also kind of far behind the others.  The UFOs didn’t seem like they were moving very fast, but they were definitely moving. I don’t think I would have reported this if I only saw one.  I knew I HAD to report it after I saw all the fighter jets.;40.183;-74.9110000000001
On September 23, 2012, in Langhorne, PA, I saw four unidentified flying objects and unusual aircraft activity.;2012-09-23 18:55:00;25 minutes;On September 23, 2012 in Langhorne, PA, I saw four unidentified flying objects and unusual aircraft activity. On September 23, 2012 at 6:55 PM ET, I saw three unidentified flying objects in the sky.  It was dusk. I was traveling west bound on Route 1 in Langhorne, PA (Bucks County) and the objects were in the western sky traveling south.  The objects were approximately 10-15 miles away. There were three separate objects in a formation.   One of the objects was 60 degrees above the horizon, the second object was 80 degrees above the horizon and the third object was 100 degrees above the horizon.  Each object appeared as a bright white line with a bubble or half orb shape on the top followed by a pinkish orange flame.  The flame remained constant in shape and size on each object.  The objects were descending, all at the same trajectory, and seemed to be moving at a slow and steady pace.  I know what a comet looks like moving through the sky and these were not comets.  Also, there was an unusual high activity of aircraft in the sky.  There were approximately a dozen planes i! n the sky flying toward the objects.  The aircraft were faster and smaller than passenger jets and I assume that they were military or fighter jets.  One of the aircraft circled around and flew low over the highway and I could see that it was a fighter jet, probably an F-18. I continued traveling on my intended route and got on the PA turnpike (Rt 276) heading West  and once on the PA turnpike, I identified a fourth object, similar in all regards to the other three but flying to the North and much higher than the others. I would lose sight of the objects among the tree line on the highway and once I got to the Jenkintown exit on the PA turnpike, I lost visibility of all objects and aircraft activity.;40.183;-74.9110000000001
Looking out at south east morning sky, I saw a bright white point of light with lit up trailing vapor ((Falcon 9 launch));2021-03-14 06:00:00;1 minute;Looking out at south east morning sky, I saw a bright white point of light with lit up trailing vapor that was several times the size of the lead point of light.  It was moving southwest to northeast in the black morning sky.  I was able to take still pictures with my cell phone and a very short few seconds video recording.;40.183;-74.9110000000001
