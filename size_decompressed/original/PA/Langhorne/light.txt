Cluster of 50 orange lights in night sky over Langhorne.;2015-08-01 21:30:00;2-4 minutes;Cluster of 50 orange lights in night sky over Langhorne. I saw about 50 orange color lights, clustered together, but with no particular shape.  They did not change formation or move in any way.   I was able to drive down my street, pull in driveway, and run in to get my family.  They came out and saw what I saw.  The difference was they had started to extinguish so there were not as many.  I would say they were gone in about 4 minutes.   Some of them were close to each other while others were further apart.  They all seemed to be the same size and color.  Very bright.;40.183;-74.9110000000001
