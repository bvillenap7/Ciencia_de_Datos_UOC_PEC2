Red and blue circluar shaped object with white flashing light in the center.;2001-12-28 01:30:00;continous;Red and blue circluar shaped object with white flashing light in the center. It was about 1:30 AM on December 28, 2001 and I looked out the window of my house and saw a red and blue circle shaped object. It was extremely bright and had a white rim around it. Inside of the circle there was a white flashing light.  About five minutes later a second identical object was seen near it.  Every once in awhile it would seem like it was getting further away. This was seen across the street from my house.  The second object was in between a tree.  But the first one was completely clear. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star may have been the cause of the sighting.  PD));40.183;-74.9110000000001
Green and amber fireball in sky;2012-10-17 01:00:00;10 seconds;Green and amber fireball in sky Was driving down Woodbourne Road on my way home when I saw a round green light, with an amber glow similar to a fireball surrounding it, descending from the west.  It travelled downward at a perfect angle at a somewhat fast speed.  I lost visual of the object in the tree line.  I came home and got my sister to go driving with me to see if we could locate it again.  I was half expecting to see if there was a fire or at least some proof to disregard it as anything  other than a unidentified flying object, but we saw nothing.  On our way home we noticed several strange jet streams that did not look at all like they were in any normal flight pattern.  One was at a 95 degree angle downward that dissipated about 3/4 the way down from the horizon (similar to how you would see a tornado coming out of the clouds).  The second was at approximately the same angle as how I observed the object, but at a different location.  I cannot think of anything that would resemble ! this object, military, commercial, or otherwise. There was no sound from the object.;40.183;-74.9110000000001
Solid orange lights arranged in the shape of the big dipper but with many more in the tail.  They floated in sync with each other.;2013-11-05 21:10:00;2 minutes;Solid orange lights arranged in the shape of the big dipper but with many more in the tail.  They floated in sync with each other and did not blink.   They were seen on a cloudy night and bright enough to see beyond a the flood lights on the soccer field.   They were drifting to the north west and went down behind the treeline.   The individual lights were a circle in shape and there was 12+.;40.183;-74.9110000000001
