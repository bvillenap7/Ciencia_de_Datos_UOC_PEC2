Pulsating red sphere that came out of no where.;2010-07-09 23:55:00;5 minutes;Pulsating red sphere that came out of no where. On July 9, 2010, at approximately 11:55 p.m., I was looking out my bathroom window towards the Ohio River (west), when this red pulsating sphere appeared.  It was moving up the river (North to south) at about the height of 400 feet.  I watched it for about 5 minutes until it disappear out of view.  I think it either came up out of the river or just appeared out of no where.;40.5631;-80.2072
