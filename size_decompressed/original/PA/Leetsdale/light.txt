Bright white light traveling in a north to south direction.  The appearance was star-like.  Had no other type lights on the craft.  Was watching this unidentified flying object from my front door looking towards the Ohio River (west).   At first I thought it was a star but that changed quickly, because of the direction it was moving.  It was no jet airplane or helicopter because it glowed.  It was flying at about the 2,000 foot level.  It was no meteorite because it was moving slow across the early morning sky.;40.5631;-80.2072
