I was walking my pet in a stroller through the Outflow Campground in Confluence, PA at 10:15 p.m.  I was walking north when an object appeared in the sky ahead of me. It was low in the sky about the height of a helicopter. It wasn't moving. There was now sound. It was the shape of half an oval for the bottom with vertical blue like rectangles on the top. Similar to thin lights.  The bottom ovalish shape part glowed orange.  I thought it might be a hot air balloon, air glider plane, or a hanging fire work released from a Confluence resident.  I stopped the pet stroller and took 1 photo and a short video of the object with my Motorola smartphone.  Then, waited to see if the object would fly over the campground. However, it just stayed in place.  After several minutes, the object moved quickly straight up into the sky. It was fast. It finally just disappeared into the night sky. Shrunk to a small orange dot before disappearing.  I waited there for several minutes. It didn't return. I kept looking for it as I continued my walk to my house.  It appears I was the lone witness to this event. Baffling, fascinating, and clearly like nothing I have ever seen in my life.;39.811;-79.3607
