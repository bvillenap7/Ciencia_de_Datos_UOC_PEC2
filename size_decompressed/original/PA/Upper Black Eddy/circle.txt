fast ball of light moving every which way;2004-12-13 21:07:00;10 seconds;fast ball of light moving every which way i was looking up at orion and i saw an airplane next to it with its red, white and blue blinking lights.  then i saw a bright white light fly across the sky then disappear then reappear moving in a curved motion.  it then reappeared and danced in the sky doing 2 or 3 complete circles and disappear again.  it seemed as if it was much lower in the sky than the airplane was and was moving extremely fast ... across the whole visible night sky in 10 seconds ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.
