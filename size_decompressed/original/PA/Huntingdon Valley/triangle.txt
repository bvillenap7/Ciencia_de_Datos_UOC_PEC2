I yelled for my roommate to look as well!  We both couldn't believe what we were seeing!  The objects were bright orange and seemed to be making formations!  At one point it looked almost like Orion's Belt!  They would then  disapper a few at a time!  The final formation was in the perfect shape of a pyramid, there was only three left at this point!  It seemed perfectly spaced and lasted for a few minutes!  I did shoot about 25 seconds of video!  They were going into several different formations within a five minute period!
