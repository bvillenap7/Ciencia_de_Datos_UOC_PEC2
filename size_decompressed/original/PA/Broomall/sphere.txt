A Dozen Orange Fireballs.;2014-02-20 19:00:00;15-20 minutes;A Dozen Orange Fireballs.  Before I went upstairs after dinner, I glanced out the window by the steps and noticed two balls of light flying westward in the sky.  What caught my eye is that they were much brighter than a plane and they were too close to each other to be planes or helicopters.  I looked west in the sky and saw that a few others had always gone past the house on the same path and were going out of view.  Four additional balls of light came into view.  Two of them looked as if they could cross paths but ended up straightening out and avoiding collision.   Another pair followed the four and after that, four individual balls of light proceeded.  These final four came one at a time and as one crossed the sky to the point where I no longer could see it, the next one would show up and cross the sky.  There may have been more lights in total, but I only saw these by accident as they were in progress.  They were orange in color (they flickered like fireballs), they did not seem to be descending (or at least noticeably descending) and they did not make any sound (I opened the window to listen).   The Philadelphia airport is less than 20 miles away and I witnessed an occasional plane in the sky with blinking lights while this was going on, but seeing these planes only made it more apparent that these were definitely not a craft like that.  I have no idea what it was that I saw.  I just know that I've never seen anything like it before. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
