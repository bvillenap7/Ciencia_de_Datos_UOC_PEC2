At about 2 PM Eastern Standard ((sic.  Daylight)) Time today, I was going out of my house to retrieve my mail, and I noticed an object in the sky that looked very similar to a dirigible, or so called cigar-shaped UFO.  The front of my house overlooks a panoramic view of eastern Scranton, Pennsylvania.  I estimate the object I saw was as big as a jetliner and it was dark silver in color moving very slowly from north to east about 20 miles per hour, then turned and headed west and out of sight from my position.  I would say I saw the object for about 2 to 3 minutes and it really startled me so I quickly came back in my house and grabbed my I phone 5 to take a photo. I would say the object probably flew near the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre airport and was in front of Montage Mountain. I notified security at the airport of the sighting at about 2:20 PM and I am awaiting someone to at least call me back, and so far no one has done so. The elevation of the object from my location was about 15 degrees, the height of the object from the ground I estimate to be about 3,000 feet up.  The distance from my location to the object I saw may have been 5 to 8 miles away.  In respect to the size of the sun, I would say this object could have been about 80 feet long or more and about 20 feet high.  The object made no sound. I will attempt to draw the object that I saw with this report and try to send it separately in an email.;41.413224908425;-75.6553010989012
