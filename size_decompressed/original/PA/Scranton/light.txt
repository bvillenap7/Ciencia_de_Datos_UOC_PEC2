Solid dull white light with a small trail traveling across the sky.;2013-01-27 21:00:00;3 seconds;Solid dull white light with a small trail traveling across the sky. Slow moving dull but visible white light traveling across the sky. To slow to be a meteor and too fast to be a plane.  Also we were seeing it from the left to right so the side. The light was always visible with a slight trail.  Planes light is visible only from front from what I have seen.  Also no marker lights.  If it was a meteor.  It was a big one.

Extremely bright ball of light over West Scranton.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus?  PD));2013-10-30 19:00:00;1 hour;Extremely bright ball of light over West Scranton. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus, we believe?  PD)) Object that is much brighter than a star appeared in the sky over west Scranton for two nights in a row immediately after sun down.  Object appeared in the same location both nights and moved very slowly in a northerly direction until it's out of sight.   Without binoculars, the object appears to be a ball of light but with binoculars, it appears gray/metallic in color judging by the reflection of its own light.   I may be incorrect but it also looked like it had a row of windows or sections that were narrowly separated, with something moving behind them.  Reminded me of the Barney Hill UFO but it was too far to be conclusive.  It's either a UFO or a low flying satellite but it is definitely not a star.    Note: object appeared in same location as a 2008 up close and personal UFO (giant orange ball light resembling the sun but wasn't since the sun was also out but in a different location) but this time the object was much further out. I observed the object on both da! ys. Two members of my family witnessed the object on day 2.;41.413224908425;-75.6553010989012
