Rectangular object moving at a very high rate of speed with no noise.;1973-01-14 19:00:00;10 seconds;Rectangular object moving at a very high rate of speed with no noise. While playing outside in the snow on a cloudless sky evening at around 7PM a friend and I say a single rectangular object with 4 lights that appeared to be at the corners moving at a very high rate of speed across the sky from north to south. The craft was at a very high altitude and no noise was heard.  We were both laying on the ground on our backs in the snow.  I saw the object and did not say anything.  As the object moved off my friend than said to me Did you see that?  I said ya what was it.  We both didn't know but concluded it was moving too fast to be an aircraft.  We were both aircraft entusiasts built alot of model airplanes and lived near the Wilkes Barre Scranton airport so we felt we had enough knowledge to make that conclusion.  The craft moved extremely fast, not totally unblievable speed but alot faster than any jet. As I grow older I think back on that night and with the increased knowledge I feel the object may have been the SR-71. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  It's unlikely that an SR-71 could be seen, but not heard.  They are very loud, particularly at the high power settings which are necessary for that aircraft to achieve high speed.

((HOAX??))  UFO over Scranton, PA.;2016-01-15 00:00:00;15 minutes;UFO over Scranton, PA. I was walking when I looked up ahead of me I noticed a large what I would say rectangular UFO that was the size of a aircraft carrier.  It was at night but it did not seem that far up in the sky.  And it seemed to just float at ease it made no noise whatsoever it had a red orb in the front and two red orbs side to side which were distant from the first I would guess at about 50 yards and after that were another 2 orbs at 50m yards it just floated smoothly like it was not even going 10 mph it seemed just silently floating in the sky.  Than it was just gone.  I looked around hoping to see if any one else saw this.  I mean this was in Scranton, PA, and what bothered me was something thus size so large was not seen by anyone else? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  Date of occurrence is flawed and illogical.  Hoax??  We have changed the date and posted.  PD));41.413224908425;-75.6553010989012
Around 2:35am at the Jets Park in West Scranton, Pennsylvania, next door to the Kane's Warehouse me and a friend saw a yellow rectangle;2021-05-27 02:35:00;About 5 minutes;Around 2:35am at the Jets Park in West Scranton, Pennsylvania, next door to the Kane's Warehouse me and a friend saw a yellow rectangle with a small and thin but very bright trail touched down nearby and shortly after we saw a tall 8 or 9 foot figure with very large white eyes standing about 30 feet from us. It was hidden behind a few trees but it growled and right after a spotlight with a low humming sound hit us and maybe scanned us and we ran out of the field near the school where me and my friend were enjoying ourselves (my friend had a drink in him, I was sober). It was very sudden and abrupt and wasn't able to take any video or pictures.;41.413224908425;-75.6553010989012
