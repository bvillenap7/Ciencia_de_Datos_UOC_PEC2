I was driving home with my mother and brother and we were driving in an alley when I noticed this craft sort of moving very slowely about maybe 100 or 200 feet in the air. The craft looked like a plane but it was moving too slowly and it's wings were inverted. Also, there appeared to be 2 bubble-shaped objects. One attached to the bottom of each wing. The bubble-shaped objects were slightly transparent, with a small blue light at the center of each one. I told my brother to stop the car and I got out and when I looked up, the object stopped and hovered directly over the car for a minute and then it started to gain speed and moved away and disappeared. Since then, I've seen the same type of object 4 or 5 times, the most recent being in December of 2002. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will request that the witness have his brother submit an independent report, as well.  PD));41.413224908425;-75.6553010989012
