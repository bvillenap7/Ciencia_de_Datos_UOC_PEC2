Two people driving north on interstate 81 at 380 junction witnessed at 3 AM an enormous disc shaped blue light soaring downward and horizontally.  The object was larger than anything the witnesses had ever seen in the sky.  It had a trail of light following it.  It was also moving faster than anything ever witnessed.  It appeared as though it had to be crashing considering the speed and proximity to the earth, but no crash site was found.  No sound was heard.   Minutes later, a second downward flash was seen further out and in a different location.;41.413224908425;-75.6553010989012
