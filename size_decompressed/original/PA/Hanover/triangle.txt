I remember commenting to myself how I was disappointed that yet another cell tower had been erected, and noted it several more times as I passed, and e pressed so to my spouse when I got home.  On returning via the same road the next day, I made a point to locate the tower.  There was no tower, nor lights, nor any other object . Though I shared this with family and select friends, I did not immediately report it and filed it into memory.  I was and am not frightened.  I am able to pinpoint the location on a map and can direct investigators if desired (though I know it has been many years.)  I honestly find it a very interesting experience and wish I had been more aware and less dismissive of it as a tower at the time.;39.79520625;-76.9800109375001

I note that most of the time we have been programmed to see twinkling lights as stars, but this night was different.  You couldnâ€™t help but notice they seemed to be in strategic alignments.  The observation was several stationary at all points East, West, South and North. My location is under a flight path, so I am always aware of the difference between the flight lights and patterns, this was completely different.  I wanted someone else to give me their opinion, I ran in and got someone else to come out and look, this person is an extremely skeptical NON-believer in UFOs.  They saw the triangles and could NOT say a word.;39.79520625;-76.9800109375001
