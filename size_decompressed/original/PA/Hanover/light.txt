Object was a solid light without any blinking lighting.  Object had no sound.  It glided across the sky for about 30 seconds and then simply vanished into the dark sky.   A second object with the same description as the first was on the same exact flight path as the first but at least 10 seconds behind the first object.  The second object faded into the sky just like the first but disappeared past where the first faded away.   Stars and distinctive aircraft are visible within the sky.  These two objects were flying at the same speed of each other but faster than any aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Swaying star seen in Hanover.;2014-10-26 23:00:00;30 minutes;Swaying star seen in hanover I was taking at the trash when I looked up and saw what appeared to be a star at first but was brighter then the other stars around it.  I continued to stare at it for a few minutes watching it flicker and sway from side to side (sometimes fast and sometimes slow) it appeared to have lights around it as well blinking every few minutes or so.  Some were red or white or green near the star.   It seem to get closer then farther away and at a few points it looked to have a out line around it that looked like a disk that would just flash for a second or two then disappear;39.79520625;-76.9800109375001

Flickering light in a stationary position for close to 20 minutes in the Western sky from PA.;2021-09-03 21:50:00;20 minutes;Flickering light in a stationary position for close to 20 minutes in the Western sky from PA. Unmoving bright flickering light in the Western sky. Originally thought to be a plane, then helicopter. However, FL was too high for helicopter. Next though it was a planet or bright star with some sort of atmospheric effect that would cause flickering. With hands cupped around eyes to reduce light pollution, it appeared to have a sort of eclippse effect. Like there was something behind the light. A different dark 'color' than the night sky? It's tough to explain. Could have just been my eyes playing tricks, but I've never seen anything like it and I was an air traffic controller for nearly 7 years.;39.79520625;-76.9800109375001
