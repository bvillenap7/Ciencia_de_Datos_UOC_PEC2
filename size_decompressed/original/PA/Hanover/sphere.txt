Orange glowing orb, bright white light emitting from it, levitating 100 ft off ground and moved out of sight;2012-05-08 05:00:00;Less than a minute;Orange glowing orb, bright white light emitting from it, levitating 100ft off ground and moved out of sight About 200ft from our house there was an orange glowing orb levitating over the hill in front of our house, a good 100ft from the ground.  Once I saw it it began to move towards the right into a group of trees and disappeared. It made no sound what so ever, but the light was so bright and strong it illuminated my room.  Although the orb was orange itself, it emitted a white light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.79520625;-76.9800109375001
