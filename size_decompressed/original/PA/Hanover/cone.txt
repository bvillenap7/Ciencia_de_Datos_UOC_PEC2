Strange object observed hovering for 10 minutes in sky over south-central PA.;2015-03-13 08:15:00;10;Strange object observed hovering for 10 minutes in sky over south-central PA. Around 0815 a.m. on March 13, 2015, spotted unusual and unfamiliar looking object in distant sky south southwest of Hanover, PA, possibly around PA/MD line.  Appeared to be one to two thousand feet above ground.   As soon as I saw the object, I thought that it was different from anything that I had ever seen before.  Called others to witness object.  One witness thought it was an incoming helicopter since we were viewing it from a hospital with a heliport.  However, it failed to grow larger or move significantly over the approximate 10 minutes that we continued to observe it as an approaching helicopter would have and it eventually just disappeared from sight.  No lights observed.  Other witness thought it looked like a balloon but, again, it did not move for around 10 minutes of viewing with wind speed 3 to 13 mph at ground level.   Did not really look like a hot-air balloon to me and I used to live in an area where hot-air ballooning was popular and it appeared to be way too high to be tethered.  Sighted this while at work so it became necessary to leave and when I returned after approximately 5 minutes the object was gone.  Hard to define exact shape, due to considerable distance.  If I had to describe the shape Iâ€™d say dome shaped on top, less curved on bottom but not flat with more of a vertical than horizontal displacement.  Kind of cone shaped I guess.  Honestly, from that distance it did not look unlike a weather balloon but, again, it remained essentially stationary in the sky for over 5 minutes and was probably too big to be a weather balloon.;39.79520625;-76.9800109375001
