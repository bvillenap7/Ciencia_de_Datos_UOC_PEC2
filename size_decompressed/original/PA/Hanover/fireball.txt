Bright red sphere sighted near Mason-Dixon Line.;2014-08-16 21:45:00;1 minute;Bright red sphere sighted near Mason-Dixon Line. Just prior to the sighting, a CH-47 military helicopter flew by going north to south, at a low altitude.  CH-47s are seen here occasionally, but not at a low altitude like this one.  Immediately, after the helicopter passed out of view, a silent, red fireball sped by traveling west to east at a right angle to the path of the copter.  It appeared to travel at a level altitude and at a constant speed.   It did not appear to be a Chinese lantern.  It was about the size of a thumb nail at arms length.
