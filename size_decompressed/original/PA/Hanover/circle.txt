It A round object was seen descending from the sky to a group of trees on top of a hill. I stayed at the trees for approximately five minutes and the ascended straight in the sky at a speed of about 5 –10 miles per hour and kept on a straight path until out of sight.  At first we thought it could be a balloon, however when it ascended in a straight path we knew it wasn’t.;39.79520625;-76.9800109375001
Two adults and one child observe an ember glowing circular object fly across the sky.;2015-09-06 20:15:00;45 seconds;Two adults and one child observe an ember glowing circular object fly across the sky. My boyfriend, daughter and I went for a late swim in the backyard.  After 20 minutes or so in the pool, my boyfriend noticed this huge ember glowing object in the sky. It was orange/yellow in color.  We noticed the object in flight on the east side of the house. It was significantly bigger than any plane or star I've ever seen in the sky.  It was as big as the biggest full moon you've ever seen... it was gliding across the sky at an extremely fast rate heading west.  We all watched it move across the sky, and slow down until it just completely disappeared into the horizon.  The whole observation was about 45 seconds or so.  It was silent, and flew very smoothly in the air.  I feel it is important to note there was no cloud cover, there are zero street lights on this block, and it is a quiet neighborhood.;39.79520625;-76.9800109375001

Sped up a little , got bright than the light disappeared as if it just went out.  I did not see it take off quickly or anything like that .  Just disappeared.   Sky was clear, no clouds. Not the first time I have seen something in this area, I just felt to stupid to report it, like I would be called crazy.;39.79520625;-76.9800109375001
