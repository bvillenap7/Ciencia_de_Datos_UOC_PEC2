Streaking to glowing light across sky;2011-07-16 22:00:00;1 min;streaking to glowing light across sky On the night of July 16, 2011, I was outside on the patio with my daughters boyfriend.  I looked up and into the night and saw what I would say to be a satellite streaking across the sky.   Then there was a big  glow for about 2 seconds and then back to normal.  We lost it for about 10 seconds and the same thing happen again just a normal moving across the sky heading east then again the big glow of light.   I never seen this before.  It was too high in the sky to be a helicopter search light, and planes don’t emit bright lights behind them.;40.4242;-79.7658
Points of light, slowly moving, fade out.;2012-04-20 09:34:00;5 Seconds;Points of light, slowly moving, fade out. Saw one bright point of light moving slowly across the sky.  It faded after moving several inches across the sky.   Would also like to mention that I saw two exactly like it near the same area several nights ago, moving slowly away from each other and then fading away.;40.4242;-79.7658
Stationary white light seen hovering off to the east of Monroeville, Pa.;2013-08-06 04:13:00;4 minutes;Stationary white light seen hovering off to the east of Monroeville, Pa. I was heading east bound on 376 heading from Pittsburgh when I saw a bright light off in the East. It was white and seemed to be stationary.  This caught my attention because I saw something similar the morning the day previous just outside my house.   As I exited onto Business 22 towards Monroeville I continued to pay attention to it.  I had stopped at a few lights on my way to the gas station and while I was waiting I used lamp posts as reference points to determine that the object was indeed still.  I also tried to use the opportunity to take a picture, but the image didn’t come out because of all the street lights.  It was a cloudy night out and no stars were visible.   As I approached the gas station I noticed that it started to dim a little.  Then as I pulled into the parking spot the object became brighter again.  I attributed this to possibly some clouds covering it briefly. Once I parked it was behind the awning of the station and some trees.  It was not in view then.  I went inside of the building, bought a few things, got in my car, pulled out and when it should have been in view again it wasn’t there.  The object looked like it could have been over the Plum, Murrysville area.   My background is Artist and small business owner. I am also an avid sky watcher and can identify common commercial aircraft.  This was neither plane nor helicopter.;40.4242;-79.7658
