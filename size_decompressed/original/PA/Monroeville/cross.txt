There were 3 things in the sky. The first one went over the church, looked like a standing up cross, not like a plane which would be a laying down cross,. It had tons of red lights and green lights on the sides lighting up the whole length. It moved very slow with no noise. Then a 2nd one came with the same kind of lights, but flying like one of our planes, not standing upright. Then the 3rd was like the 1st.  The lights were bright, and flashing.  The 1st object flew rather low and very slow, and made no noise, as the 3rd one also seemed to not make noise. But the middle one made noise similar to a plane.  I know our planes have lights on them, but these had several lights, just guessing maybe like 20 -30 lights.  I didnâ€™t know what I was supposed to do. Sadly I did not have my phone with me to take pictures. The objects were flying from south east to south west, in a sort of curve around the area i was in.;40.4242;-79.7658
