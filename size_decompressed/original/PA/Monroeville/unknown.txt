I don't know if I am crazy or what.  The first.  This took place as we were talking about UFOs.  We see a light, almost like a star soon acroos the sky and the go backwards, up and down and then came back towards us and zoomed away. It literally looked like a star!   Another time I was with my friend and we were biking. There was a man in front of us walking.  We were biking in Pittsburgh and he just disappeared!!!  I'm not joking.  Nobody believes us.  This man just disappeared infront of us.  Just gone.  We looked everywhere around but there was nowhere for him to have just gone.  There is a 15ft brick wall on one side and the water on the other.  He just vanished.;40.4242;-79.7658
