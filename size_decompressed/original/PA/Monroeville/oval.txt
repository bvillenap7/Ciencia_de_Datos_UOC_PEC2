5 Red/Yellow Ovals seen by 3 witnesses.;2013-10-22 22:30:00;5 minutes;5 Red/Yellow Ovals seen by 3 witnesses On 10/22/2013 at 10:30pm, my neighbor and I saw 5 oval objects hovering in the sky.  We were in my front yard.  One was by itself and 4 other ones were grouped together in a cluster.   My neighbor called her husband out and he also witnessed the last 2 ovals as they flew away.  They all went south.  The first one left and one by one they all followed in the same direction.   They all were red in color, with a little bit of yellow in them and very bright.  Like a very bright light.  We were all stunned.   I attempted to take a picture of them on my cell phone and my cell phone screen went blank.  In addition, when I entered my home my television could not get a picture and was full of static for about 5 minutes and then returned to normal.;40.4242;-79.7658
Two oval objects white/silver traveling rapid high rate of speed high up in the atmosphere any plane that I have seen.;2015-09-23 12:50:00;1 minute;Two oval objects white/silver traveling rapid high rate of speed high up in the atmosphere any plane that I have seen. I was driving, heading east just off the Pennsylvania Turnpike Monroeville Interchange.  I caught sight of an oval object in the higher atmosphere traveling at a rapid speed.  It was moving in the westward direction.   Several other drivers around me also pointed up, whether they saw what I did or I am just speculating at that I am not certain.  Upon driving a little further, there was a second oval object, again, white/silver in color traveling the same direction and at the same rapid rate of speed.  Again, it was higher in the atmosphere.
