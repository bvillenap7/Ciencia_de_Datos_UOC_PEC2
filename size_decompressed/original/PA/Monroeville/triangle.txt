Bright orange, low flying, something.;2017-07-27 03:30:00;5 minutes;Bright orange, low flying, something. bright orangeish light that came up over the horizon and slowly got bigger as it came closer i noticed flashing lights like a plane would have. one red one green and a row of white lights. the lights flashed red in the front then 5-6 white lights in a row going down / across the craft with a green one on the end.  it did have the sound a plane would make but for as low as it was flying it should of been a lot louder.  i guessing it was no more than 5-600 feet off the ground.  it passed over me and it was out of sight in 10 seconds.  of course i had left my phone at home still cant believe no one saw it;40.4242;-79.7658
