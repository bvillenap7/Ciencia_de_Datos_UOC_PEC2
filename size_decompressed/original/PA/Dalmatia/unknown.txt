It was nighttime and I was stargazing. When I looked up I noticed a light moving around in random directions rapidly in my area of sight. It then moved quickly in a direction and there was a big flash of light. The UFO disappeared. A moment later, the light showed up again in a different area in the sky. I believe there was another flash and it was gone after that. It was far in the distance so I do not know exactly what I was seeing. The people with me thought it was a drone and reflected off the sun but the sun seemed too far gone for that. It would be nice to have this explained by a professional.;40.6483;-76.8797
