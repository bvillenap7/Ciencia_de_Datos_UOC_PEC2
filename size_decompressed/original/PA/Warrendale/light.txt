Witnessed 9 crafts that disappeared.;2015-07-04 21:56:00;15 minutes;Witnessed 9 crafts that disappeared Dear sir,   I spoke to you via telephone on 7/4/2015 around 2230 hrs. concerning some lights I had observed near my home in Warrendale, PA, about 20 miles North of Pittsburgh, Pa.   A brief background on me, I served in the United States Marines and have been a police officer for 25 years. I live in a rural area, and own 11 acres, it is mostly a wooded area. On 7/4/2015 at about 2150 hrs, eastern time I was watching neighbors lighting fireworks and I was talking on the phone, when I noticed what I thought was a commercial airliner approaching from the northeast.  I noticed that the light was a bright orange color, which was odd. Then there was a second one following it.  Both craft were traveling about the same speed as an airplane.  They traveled for about 5-10 seconds towards me then just disappeared.  Then two more lights appeared and followed the same path as the first two, with the same distance between them and both disappeared as the first two. Then, I witnessed a craft with a red light do the exact same thing. This was followed by 4 more orange lights with the same outcome.  I called the local CBS news station, KDKA television but got no response.  I also posted on social media asking if anyone had noticed this, but as of yet, I haven't gotten a response. Feel free to contact me at my number provided bellow with any follow up.;40.6546;-80.0761
