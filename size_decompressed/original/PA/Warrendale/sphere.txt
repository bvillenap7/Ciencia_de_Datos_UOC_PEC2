I was at work, and decided to go out side and have a cigarette, and a cup of coffee.  I was looking at the sunset and the surrounding area.  As I swept my eyes along the horizon line moving from east to west I saw a spherical object hovering about 35 degrees above the horizon E/SE.  The sphere was a white color with a black or dark blue band across the middle, this banded extended from either side.  Above the band where a row spaced windows/dark rectangles which seemed to wrap around the object.  There was no additional profile to object, no tail section, no engines, no wings.  Watched for 7secs.  Small cloud formation slowly covered object from south to north.  When cloud had moved past the location, the object was gone.  That's All.;40.6546;-80.0761
