Large round disc hovering only 400 to 500 feet off the ground with glass dome on top;1995-07-01 09:00:00;8-10 minutes;Large round disc hovering only 400 to 500 feet off the ground with glass dome on top It was a summer night around I was around the age of 12-13 every night my friends and I would all get together and play a game called release, which is a game of tag and there would be anywhere from 8 to 12 of us playing every night in downtown Kittanning. We were in the middle of our game when we looked up and across the road which was about 50 to 70 yards away and had seen a round disc shaped object that if I had to guess it was only 400 to 500 feet above the ground.  You could see lots of detail including the glass dome on top which was very bright inside.  You couldnt make anything out inside but the light on the inside it was very bright inside.  It was just hovering and moving very slow just moveing up the streetnot making a sound.  There were no other lights on this one just the light emitting out of the glass dome on top of the object.  We stood there and looked at it for what seemed like forever I know it was at least 10 15 min before it drifted out of sig! ht. We tried calling the Pittsburgh news stations describeing what we were seeing and they had said they have a large number of calls coming in about the same thing and tried to say we were seeing a blimp. IM sorry but I know what a blimp looks like and there is no way you could tell me that I was looking at a blimp. It was many years ago but I can remember it like it was yesterday. It was so low you could see so much detail on it and from there on I was a believer. I have told guys at work and they laugh at me when I do but I really dont care if anybody believes me or not I know what me my friends and the parents that were there had seen that night.
