Huge dark gray metal disc with colored lights hovering above a tree.;1981-06-01 20:00:00;3 SECONDS;Huge dark gray metal disc with colored lights hovering above a tree. I was about 12 years old and I walked out on my back porch which was on the second story  .  I looked and and saw a big disc shaped craft hovering a few feet above the tree.  It was at least three times the size of the tree, it made no sound but it did have colored lights around the center of the craft.  I saw it a few seconds then it completely vanished.  I never saw it move away, it just seemed to disappear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.809;-79.5189
