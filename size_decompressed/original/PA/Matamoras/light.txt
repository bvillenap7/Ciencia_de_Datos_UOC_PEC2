While watching the large moon rising in the East-Southeast through layers of mist, my husband & I saw two large solid red lights suddenly appear somewhat low in the sky - approaching from the ENE from the direction of Greenville, NY.   They looked like they had just turned in our direction.  At first it looked like a small plane with lights on each wing pointing forward â€“ one light was higher than the other as you would see if a plane made a sharp turn.  But there was no sound.    We thought they might be lights on 2 helicopters traveling together (they looked about the height we would sometimes see helicopters traveling in our area) - but the red lights were solid - not blinking.   They moved in pretty close formation, then began to move apart from each other.  One appeared to turn away toward the east, and the two moved further apart from each other.   The light that turned away disappeared (as though the light had been extinguished).   The other light continue! d moving toward us for about another 20 seconds - then that light began to shrink and it also disappeared.   Throughout the 2-1/2 to 3 minute event, there was no sound from the lights (or whatever the lights were on).   We continued to watch for another 4-5 minutes to see if they would reappear, but they did not.   We saw one red light travel in the same direction yesterday (4-25-13) at about the same time & disappear in the same manner - also with no noise.  We will go outside tomorrow night at the same time to see if it appears again.;41.3674;-74.7154
