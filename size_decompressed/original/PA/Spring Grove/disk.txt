Tonight me and my stepdad we out on the porch when we noticed a bright orb in the sky that was closer and brighter than all of the other stars in the sky.  We got my telescope out to take a better look. We both saw a row of 4 lights that were diagonally lined up and they would keep fading in to a really bright light  And fade out until they disappeared.  The have been hovering and seemingly getting closer to our house.  They have been in the night sky for about 3 hours now.;39.8545;-76.8813
