It was a ball of light it was high in the sky over my neighbors house and was traveling west then went behind a cloud and then disapeared and reapeared going south about little under a quater of a mile west from where last seen. This time I saw it disapear it first turned off the light and looked metallic and then totally disapeared and it again reapeared about a quater of a mile west traveling west again.

Bright orange stationary light that disappeared quickly.;2005-08-16 20:55:00;10 seconds;Bright orange stationary light that disappeared quickly. I was in my car about to turn into my driveway when I looked up into the sky and saw a stationary bright orange colored light with thin beams of light coming from it. I watched it for about 10 seconds. I looked away for a second, and when I looked back, it was gone. The object was about 2/3 the size of the full moon and was north-east from my location, and was as high as a helicopter would fly.;40.1678;-80.2591000000001
Red balls of light;2012-08-04 21:20:00;five minutes;Red balls of light I was driving and was at a stop sign, and at 9:20pm at dusk looked to the north at a 45 degree angle and saw four red lights a little bigger then stars in a square pattern over a hill.  They were about two hundred feet away from each other and were at the elevation of small planes.  I watched for about 30 seconds as the lights stayed in the same place until each one slowly started disappearing.   I started driving up the hill and right before the last one disappeared I saw in the distance another one shot up from ground to the same height as the other ones and started heading north.  While at the top of the hill watching it a small propeller plane was flying west heading towards it.   Within about hundred feet of the red light the plane made a sharp 180 degree turn and started heading in the opposite direction to the east.  I then was watched the red ball of light go out of sight into the distance. Since I star gaze almost every night and never seeing anything like! this, they could have not of been flares due to the four staying in the same place and the other one moving.;40.1678;-80.2591000000001

Bright unknown object hovered for 60 minutes.;2016-11-10 18:00:00;1 hour;Bright unknown object hovered for 60 minutes. My wife and I observed a hovering lighted object for 1 hour over the north sky in Washington, PA.  It was bright and hovered in one position for 60 minutes.  Multiple aircraft circled and observed aircraft.  It disappeared suddenly.   I am an Emergency Physician and well trained observer and this persisted for over an hour and was in Pittsburgh international airspace and multiple aircraft circled the object.  Cellular service was disrupted during event.;40.1678;-80.2591000000001
3 lights, odd red color;2021-05-08 21:00:00;5 minutes;3 lights, odd red color Last night 5/8/21, driving home around 9:00 PM, a couple of minutes from my house, I saw three red lights in the sky.  They were a strange color of red, almost like a roadside flare color.  I followed out on to a dark country road.  Two of the lights disappeared. Then the last one disappeared.  Then it reappeared, then another, then all three  From my perspective, they were not in a line nor triangle and were at different altitudes.  I estimate below 3 thousand feet, the height normally helicopters are seen at.  The objects did not have any navigation lights and there was no sound. I tried to catch a movie.  I thought I was taking a movie and even zoomed in enough to see a hexagonal structure in the center.  It turns out I wasn’t recording.  Too much inexperience and adrenaline.  Anyway, I got home and sat in the driveway looking for them.  While watching after about 3-4 minutes, I see the starlink line transiting, moving towards the east.  I live just north! of Washington PA.  What I saw was not Starlink, but that is an odd coincidence.  Also, I worked for the USAF for 25 years and have seen many objects flying, but never one I couldn’t ID. This morning, searching around the internet, I found a picture that most closely resembled what I saw. I do so hope you have a report that discusses the same sighting.;40.1678;-80.2591000000001
