My wife then screams and shouts at me to stop and pull over I said impossible until it flashed in the front of my windshield and flashed and reappeared in different places in front and close as it appears to look like the moon but there is a weird light behind it that shows a shape of it's appearance...it looks exactly like the moon as it's shine and no one has spoke about it like no one had seen it except us....now I can see theses UFO flying shapes everywhere there to fast for my phone to capture and there in a formation that changes but there linked together they show me they link in any formation horizontal vertical ways but they show me in full view but there tra! nsparent white and each one is round and extremely fast and close range with no wind behind them no sound they won't let you picture them and there pointing to the east always going east except for the moon jumping around for me to especially see to have me witness it then it was gone we moved back to Florida and now I have weird emotions that have me go out side and witness them I had a friend also witness this he is a veteran and I was emotionally drawn outside and we witness it together now I ignore my emotion's I feel like it saying go east and worse my friend also said the sky of stars was in a triangle pointing to the east as the UFO's kept flying in that direction...
