Next thing we know the &quotstar&quot appeared to get bigger glowing bright red Husband and I thought it was Mars we were looking at.  Next thing we know the star appeared to get bigger glowing bright red then became smaller and smaller in size. It twinkled white then faded away. 3 minutes later a second one came from another direction and did the same thing.  Never seen anything like this in my life!  And I'm always looking up!;40.1678;-80.2591000000001
