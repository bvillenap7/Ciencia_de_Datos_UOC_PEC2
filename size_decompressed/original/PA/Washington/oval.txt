Then seemed to bounce off and make a relatively sharp turn upward and to the south.  Several aircraft, totally unrelated to the event, flew by in the next 15 minutes and the altitude of those craft seemed high than the ufo.   I have never seen anything like this before.  Object was observed by myself and my wife. We are both college grads. I am retired and my wife is self employed.;40.1678;-80.2591000000001
Multiple orange lights in SWPA skies.;2014-08-23 21:00:00;15 minutes;Multiple orange lights in SWPA skys On August 23, 2014, at approximately 9 pm in Washington, PA, my neighbor and I were walking our dogs.  Coming from the East and heading west over the sky we saw multiple bright orange lights in the sky.  They were quite a distance apart from one another but traveled in a mostly straight formation.  They did not make any sound.   They traveled rather slowly across the sky.  They did not blink but were just a solid orange. This must of taken about 15-20 minutes.   First we saw 6, then 4, then 8, they were in groups.  It was a very cloudy night so they did disappear behind clouds but sometimes it looked like they just disappeared without going behind clouds.   Thank you for letting us tell someone.;40.1678;-80.2591000000001
