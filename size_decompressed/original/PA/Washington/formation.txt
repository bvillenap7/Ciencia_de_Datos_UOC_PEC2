I quickly realized they weren't birds as they were too easily visible at this time of night. They appeared almost out of nowhere, were moving low-ish in the sky, fast and silent. Each of the craft looked independent of the others but moved at pace as if connected. They looked like birds that were well lit from below, but didn't move like birds and being dark not enough light to light them up. They were a light reddish color and moved in a general north to south direction. They disappeared over my neighbors roof and I lost sight. I walked over to look south and didn't see them anymore. They may have banked east, or disappeared, at that point. At first, I thought it could be a meteor shower, but nothing looked aflame and it came in flat, not at a downward angle. They also surprised me being silent and appearing out of nowhere.;40.1678;-80.2591000000001
