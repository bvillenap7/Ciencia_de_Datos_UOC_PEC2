I did go outside I heard the panic in her voice.   Upon going out my front door this is what I saw 4 objects in the sky near by my home they looked like red fireballs I was stunned and said what the heck is that I went next door to my neighbors home and proceeded to tell her she needed to come outside and look at this so at this time we were both looking up and saw 4 fireball objects with no noise then they combined into 2 balls then 1 ball and then the light just went out and disappeared. Then as myself and my friend were talking I said look there is an airplane you can clearly here it and see that its an airplane so then what was the objects we just saw?  As we were c! ontinuing to discuss this all of a sudden the fireballs were again flying near the same spot we just saw them in and now they were back to being 4 balls then once again combined into 2 then 1 red ball. I just wanted to report what we witnessed as I am very baffled at what we saw.;40.3719;-76.1993
