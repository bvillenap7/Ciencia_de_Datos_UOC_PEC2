Strange light formations on long exposure photo's...;2010-07-04 22:30:00;1/2 hour;Strange light formations on long exposure photo's... I live in a small farm area in south east Pennsylvania, about 60mi. northwest of Philadelphia.  The date is July 4th 2010, time is approximately 22:00 hrs.  I was taking some long exposure photo's of the few fireworks the city of Womelsdorf budget allowed, not really looking at what it was that was happening in front of the lens.  I was just trying to keep the shutter open long enough to get a shot of the fire works over the cornfield, into the valley below.  My location is 40 degrees, 24',39 north x 76 degrees, 14',31 west.  Photo's that I have e-mailed to the director were shot at 173 degrees south to 132 degrees south south/east.   Upon viewing the photo's on the computer about an hour later, I came across some light formations in the sky on the photo's that none of the kids or my wife could remember seeing  during the short display of fireworks we witnessed. The long thin line with 12 red lights and 13 white lights running along the line show up in several photo's.  Some of the photo's have 2 (two) or 3(three) of these objects in them.  There are also some strange greenish/yellow swooshes accompanying these objects in some of the photo's.  There is also a red and a green linear light  below the large linear group of 12 red lights and 13 white lights.  All of these objects show up on the group of photo's in different locations around the area the fireworks were located.  There is even one photo where the objects are behind the fireworks.  These objects are definitely not a part of the fireworks, since they appear the same, with no change over the 15 to 20 sec. exposure time.;40.3719;-76.1993
