Meteor Dropped from Northern Sky Possibly into NY or Canada from Pittsburgh, PA, Region.;2014-02-28 21:00:00;10 seconds;Meteor Dropped from Northern Sky Possibly into NY or Canada from Pittsburgh PA Region Husband and I were going east on I-70 about 9 at night in car maybe 3-5 miles east of Bentleyville, PA.  It was several hours into the darkness (February).  Our view was mostly northern somewhat northeastern horizon in the windshield view, at that point on I-70.  First we saw a bright, round light, like a large star, come from upper view, downward, traveling very slowly, it seemed. We both declared it to be a falling star.  It stayed constant in shape and size and dropped straight down into the horizon in front of us disappearing just above the visible land horizon.   If the meteor made it through the atmosphere, we guess that remnants would have landed in very northern PA, NY or Canada.  I wonder what they saw from their view.;40.1207;-80.0043
