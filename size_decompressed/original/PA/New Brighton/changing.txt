Then changed to a play jack shape with clustered balls in center and at end of each spoke. I was sitting in my bedroom and typing a letter.  Looking out the window, I observed what I first thought was a plane in trouble . . . seemed to be falling downward.  Soon afterward, the object changed and took the shape of a game jack, having golden balls clustered around the center and at the end of each spoke.  I watched as some of the balls left the object and started floating off.  I got excited and went downstairs to alert my husband and get my binoculars.  We went outside and noticed that two neighbors were also observing the object.   They also thought, at first, that it was a plane in trouble.  Soon more neighbors came outside and joined us in viewing the object.  By this time, almost all of the golden balls had separated from the main object and were floating around the sky.  Remember, this sighting was in broad daylight on a rather sunny afternoon.  Some of the neighbors commented that we were merely looking at a cluster of balloons.  However that explanation was not possible since the spoke object flew in and out of the round golden balls like a 'mother hen', seemingly arranging them in patterns.  The whole group was moving slowily to the south.   While watching this, we saw a commercial airliner going from north to south and though high up, it was lower than the objects.  We counted the balls and came up with an approximate number of 34.  A strange mood came over all of us and the group broke up, returning to our homes without much comment.  It seemed as if we did not want to have further discussion on the sighting.   Several of us had binoculars and the objects just looked like bright golden spheres   The jack object was not as brilliant.;40.7384;-80.2921
