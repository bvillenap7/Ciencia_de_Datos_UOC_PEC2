Black triangle surrouned by silver sphears moving south towards Pittsburgh, PA.;2003-06-30 21:00:00;10 minutes;Black triangle surrouned by silver sphears moving south towards Pittsburgh, PA. While taking an evening walk I noticed someone in a car near me point up to the sky.  Wondering what they were looking at, I too looked up into the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a black triangle that was standing upright.  Altitude could have ranged anywhere from 10-12,000 feet.  This black triangle in the western sky puzzled me for several reasons.  As it was in the direction of a seeting sun on a clear evening it did not reflect any sunlight as I have seen airliners do thousands of times.  The strangest thing about the whole event were the other objects that appeared to be with this black triangle.  On each side of this triangle appeared 3-4 silvery spheres.  From my view they appeared on each side of the triangle lined up at 45-degree angles.  My girlfriend who was with me noticed the triangle, but because of poor vision could not see the spheres (they were smaller than the triangle).  I witnessed these objects for a total of about 5-10 minutes.  The objects appeared to be heading South-South West and it seemed as though they were following along the Beaver River and towards the Ohio River just north of Pittsburgh.  After rushing into the house to grab a pair of binoculars I could not find the object again.  I'm an airplane enthusiast and I can identy almost any civilian/military craft with just a glance.  This was neither a civilian or military craft.  The objects in question emitted no sound, lights, or trail.  On a similar note, while watching CNN the following night at around 1 AM there was a report that strange lights were seen that night over the city of Pittsburgh.  I have found no written reports in any newspapers about this event and only saw one mention of the event on the news.;40.7384;-80.2921
