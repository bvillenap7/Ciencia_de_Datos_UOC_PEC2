Bouncing object in sky in New Brighton, PA;2012-03-22 22:37:00;10 seconds;Bouncing object in sky in New Brighton, PA My sister in law & I were on our front porch, in New Brighton, PA & we were looking to the Northwest when we saw what we thought was an airplane at first until it started bouncing around like a ping pong ball, then it simply disappeared.  This sighting was the 3rd time tonight we have seen this.  Not sure of the shape, but it had a red & white light on (thats why we thought plane at first).  We were looking in this direction tonight because for the last couple of nights, around this same time, we have seen the same thing, in the exact same spot in the sky.  LAst night it just hovered then vanished.  Has anbody else seen this????.  If we had to guess it may be somewhere near the PA/OH border in northwest PA.;40.7384;-80.2921
