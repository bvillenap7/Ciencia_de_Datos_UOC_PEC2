On 7/12/02, at 2 PM, after crossing the Fallston bridge, into New Brighton,  while facing the NNW, I  saw in the middle of  the nearest formed chemtrail's narrow stream, an intensely, luminous, diagonal white line.  It maintained this position during my 25 seconds of observation and it never appeared to move. It's length was about 1/4 inch at arm's length and the chemtrail's width was only slightly wider than this hovering, luminous white line, itself. The diagonal tilt of this luminous white line was about 50 degrees, upwards towards the right. I lost sight of it while driving.;40.7384;-80.2921
