Triangle shaped craft flying low.;2008-04-19 22:30:00;3 minutes;Triangle shaped craft flying low. Daughter and I were sitting on porch when we seen a very large craft heading east and flying very slow and skimming the trees. 3 Massive white lights at each corner and a small red one in the middle or side, was hard to tell. blinking. I didn't hear any sound from where I was. I didn't think much about it until I seen it again on April 22 with my sister and it Glided right over us very slowly, we then heard a low bass murmur sound coming from it. As it got right above us it turned east. The lights were so bright you couldn't see the craft itself.;40.7384;-80.2921
