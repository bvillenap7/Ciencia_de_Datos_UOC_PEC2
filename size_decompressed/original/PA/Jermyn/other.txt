Jet tailing a completely blacked out silent object;2011-10-28 21:30:00;4 mins;Jet tailing a completely blacked out silent object Me and my son were working in the woods of northeast pa at a haunted hayride when a third peron at our scene told us to look up and said he sees a UFO....Me and my son look up and see what appeared to be a Military type jet chasing a completely DARK OBJECT directly overhead. The object was roughly the same size as the jet and made no noise and had not a single light on it. The jet was roughly 50 feet back from the object and was keeping up with it. I looked at eh object carefully as it was only 500feet or so overhead under cloud cover and looked for jet engine afterglow or any lights and there were absolutley non. I could only hear the jet and did not hear anyother noise as it flew over. The object can only be described as having a circular front with 2 sweeping wing type sides that came back to a point and seemed to come together. The jet and object flew in a northern direction as i live in northeast pa. My son is now a believer and is still talking about w! hat he thinks he saw and is not sure what to make out of it. After i returned home i posted a comment on my facebook and a few other actors who work in the same area of the mountain in the woods also commented that t hey saw it and did not know what to make out of it..Take this as the truth and know that it has forever changed my life ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
