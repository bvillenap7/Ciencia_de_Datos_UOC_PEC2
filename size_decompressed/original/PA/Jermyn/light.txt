Two aircraft circling light, light disappears, streaks between them later.;2008-10-29 20:00:00;5 minutes;Two aircraft circling light, light disappears, streaks between them later. I was driving north on the Casey Highway coming home from Marywood University.  At approximately 8:00 PM, I took the Jermyn/Mayfield exit, and I was driving up the ramp to head into town.  As I was driving up, I saw an orange light in the sky, surrounded by two aircraft, possibly helicopters, but I was not sure.  I decided to keep driving until I got to my house, which took roughly five minutes.  I parked my car, got out, and went to a clearing to get a better view of where I saw the craft. At this point I thought there may have been some sort of accident, as the two aircraft were still circling the sky, but the orange light was gone. I kept staring, trying to figure out what was going on. After about 30 seconds of looking, the orange light reappeared between the two aircraft. It streaked across the sky, leaving a trail, and disappeared. This event happened in less than a second. Under normal circumstances, if I had not seen the orange light earlier, and the light didnâ€™t streak through the sky between the aircraft, I would have imagined it was a shooting star, but with the events adding up, I believe it to be a UFO.;41.5768;-75.5884
