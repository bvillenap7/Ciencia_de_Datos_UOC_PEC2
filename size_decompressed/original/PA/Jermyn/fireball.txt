Fireball moving northwest to southeast;1974-07-15 05:30:00;aprox. 5 seconds;Fireball moving northwest to southeast I'm not shure of the exact date, but I do remember it was Summer at the time, and it was just before sunrise.The sky was getting light in the East at the time. I was in the 7th grade at the time and delivering the morning paper, walking south/southwest. A streak of color in the sky caught my attention. I looked up and saw what appeared to be a multi colored fireball that had a long tail, moving at a high rate of speed, in a northwest to southeast direction.It didnt seem to be too high in the sky. I watched it for a few seconds before a house blocked my view. I quickly moved to the side of the house so I can continue wathing it, thinking if it were a meteor i would see it crash. But when I did it was gone. The fireball was the size of a quarter held at arms length, and there were no sounds heard at the time.;41.5768;-75.5884
