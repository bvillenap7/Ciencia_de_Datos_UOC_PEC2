Slow moving, quiet, triangle shape at low altitude in dark sky.;2017-10-10 19:20:00;1.5 minutes;Slow moving, quiet  triangle shape at low altitude in dark sky. While walking with my wife and daughter a little after dusk, my daughter (6) pointed at some slow moving lights asking what it was.  I originally dismissed it as a plane but then realized the size was too big meaning it was low to the ground and moving very slowly. My next thought was blimp but it was moving too quickly for that and the shape of lights didn't fit.  As it came closer, we could see the lights at the front of the object that looked like cockpit lights.  Halfway back were two white solid lights, then at the back two more white solid lights.  The entire shape based on the lights was a triangle.  In the middle of the triangle on the bottom of the object was a bright red blinking light.  It continued to move too slowly for a plane, and the only sound was a low humming noise.  We watched as the object never changed course and slowly moved off over the horizon. With the lighting of the sky, the only shape we could make out was the pattern of the lights, we never saw a full body shape.;40.5689;-79.8484
