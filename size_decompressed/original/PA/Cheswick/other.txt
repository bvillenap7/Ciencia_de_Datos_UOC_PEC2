Saw what I thought was a crescent moon, yellow and orange in color.  Went to get my dog and thought it was overcast, why can I see the Moon.  When I walked back to look again it had changed shape.  It's top half was gone and a large orange light was now in the center.  The bottom of the crescent faded and the orange light got bigger.  The shape started to lose color and size going to white.  It just reduced till it was gone.;40.5689;-79.8484
