Orange/White dancing flame;2011-09-04 22:00:00;3 minutes;Orange/White dancing flame Looking out my window approx 10:00 at night, I noticed a dancing orange/white flame approx arms length above the phone pole wires and approx 8 in length, visually.  By the time I called my sons to the window to view this, it had risen straight up in the sky quickly and went north until it turned black and disappeared.;40.5689;-79.8484
