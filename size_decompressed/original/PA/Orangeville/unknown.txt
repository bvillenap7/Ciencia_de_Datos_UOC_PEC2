Brilliant  shimmering gold object sighted 1 hr after sunset;2000-10-13 19:25:00;10 minutes;Brilliant  shimmering gold object sighted 1 hr after sunset I observed a brilliant, shimmering gold object in the western sky, brighter than any planet, and appeared to have flashing red and green lights.  May've been the Space Shuttle, but I can't confirm this, so it remains a UFO.;41.1042;-76.3782
