4 stationary lights in the sky, two on each side of moon.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-23 00:24:00;Unknown;4 stationary lights in the sky, two on each side of moon. I was walking home from my boyfriend’s house and noticed a beautiful red moon.  As I took a photo of it I noticed there were at least 2 unidentifiable stationary objects in the sky.  It could have been one on each side of the moon, each with two very bright lights or 4 (2 on each side of the moon) each with one light.  I’m not sure but I am certain they didn’t belong there.  I took the picture and continued walking home.  Once I turned the corner the objects were out of site and so was the moon.
