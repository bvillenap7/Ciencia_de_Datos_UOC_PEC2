That is when Bear came tearing into the house..Boss and I went outside and she quickly retreated to the door as she whimpered to go back inside. I notice a strange noise and looked around to see where it was. Then I saw it, it was one triangular shaped, white light, it seemed large, although it was pretty high up, I could still hear the terrible high-pitched noise it was making. It hovered there for only a few seconds and then it took off, and I mean ''Took Off !!'' It went straight up until it disappeared out of site.;39.8667;-75.3862
