Glowing hovering multi colored sphere hovering above main st school Brookhaven.;2014-04-27 00:00:00;~5 minutes;Glowing hovering multi colored sphere hovering above main st school brookhaven. I was taking my dog for a late night routine walk when I seen this glowing ball of light hovering behind the main st elementary school woods.  I was a block away when I heard this strange oddly pitched humming.   Then when I looked up there was this huge ball of light which glowed beyond the woods horizon.  It glowed a firey red, then to orange, yellow, green, blue.   After watching it for about five minutes floating there, it descended beyond the tree line and my vision.  I know it was no flare and it defied gravity/was giving out a strange noise.  My dog was also whinning and pulling on the leash to leave the area.;39.8667;-75.3862
