Saw a white grocery bag like object climb to over 10,000ft with a smaller white object trailing the larger one to the SW.;2001-06-09 16:25:00;15 minutes;Saw a white grocery bag like object climb to over 10,000ft with a smaller white object trailing the larger one to the SW. While at the Reading WWII reinactment, we were watching,with binoculars, several aircraft doing flybys. As we looked to the SW, I spotted what looked at first like a white balloon being carried upwards very rapidly. The cloud deck was at about 8,oooft and the object went above them to about 10,000ft and then hovered as if caught in an air pocket. Several other people thought it looked like a grocery type white bag, but there was a smaller piece of a white object that we saw traveling along with the larger bag. It looked unattached. After about 15 minutes of being motionless the objects started to climb higher until they were out of site to the SW. About 25 people around us saw and watched the objects climb. I've been to many airshows over the years and never saw anything like this before - it definetly was not a balloon. I was monitoring the radio freqs of the airport, but nothing was mentioned about the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome additional reports from other witnesses to this incident.  It does seem odd to us that a simple bag, containing either hot air or helium, would continue to rise so far in such a short period of time, rise above the clouds, and then continue to rise out of sight.

At first thought it was lights on top of a mountain until we cleared the trees blocking my bottom view and this is when i noticed they were not hill top lights because the mountains were very low compared to altitude of lights they at first were almost straight in sky but then turned up from bottom right hand side then light #4 started to get smaller and dissapeared then 3 then 2 then 1 until all that was left was a BIG BLACK MASS that looked kind of Roundish but also like the form of an egg (like it was moving) with a small spe! ck of a Light in back then it just stayed there for a few seconds then vanished. I think this looked like what police officers witnessed years ago in Ohio. (At first looked someting like this)>  -- --**-- --;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
