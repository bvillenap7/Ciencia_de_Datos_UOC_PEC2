Single pink light deep in space darting around sky and hovering;2002-11-01 02:27:00;2 minutes;Single pink light deep in space darting around sky and hovering We saw a single light, less brilliant than a star, deep in space.  The light was pink in color and it darted all over the sky in a somewhat jagged pattern.  It moved much too quickly to be any human craft that I've ever seen.  At some points in flight it seemed to stop and hover for a moment much like a humming bird.  This could not have been a meteor because the pattern of flight was too controlled.  Also, I was most intrigued with this sighting because we saw it on a mountain at a city overlook where light pollution is highest.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
diamond shaped craft hovering over area disappered quickly;2003-04-15 08:00:00;20 seconds;diamond shaped craft hovering over area disappered quickly I was driving home after dropping my girlfriend off at school when i was near my home i happened to glance at the sky and see a silver-white colored craft with a very odd diamond shape to it and it seemed to be stopped or going very slow because a plane would be much noticeable of going fast - and i turned my head back to the road for a second or two, glanced back and it was gone out of sight nowhere to be seen from any angle at all - left very quickly;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
