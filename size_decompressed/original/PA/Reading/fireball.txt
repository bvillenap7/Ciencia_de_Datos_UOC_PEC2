I was driving home from Thanksgiving dinner at my friends house, about five minutes away. It was a beautiful day and I had one heineken;2011-11-24 20:45:00;a few minutes;I was driving home from Thanksgiving dinner at my friends house, about five minutes away.  It was a beautiful day and I had one heineken and one wine over the course of over six hours.  Plus all of the beautiful food, just putting it in perspective.  Along Butter Lane which is a windy lane with a stream running along it, I saw a weird round sphere, bright red and sparkling like a firecracker floating along the treetops. I was scared! It was like nothing I had ever seen.  Plus there was no traffic along this road at the time so I was totally creeped out.  Another car passed me going the opposite way and then one followed me onto my street, which made me feel a little bit better. I'm telling you, I was freaked out! I pulled into my driveway, locked the car door and made a beeline into my kitchen.  I put my purse on the counter, picked up my kitchen phone and went back outside.  I looked at the sky and the damned thing is coming from behind the houses across the street.  And it looked pretty close too. My best friend lives next door and he still had company from Thanksgiving from the cars in the driveway.  I dialed his number but it was on answering machine.  The thing was now gone.  But I know what I saw.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849

Saw some fireworks coming from the trees East of us.  Were  waiting to take picture of them when 3 VERY Large, Bright Fireballs came up from the  direction of the ground one after the other.  At first, we thought it was some strange  firework but they remained intact.  They were spaced a few seconds apart, rose from ground  one after the other & flew following each other in a straight line across the sky.  They  flew West to East over Exeter/Reading,PA toward what looked like Heat Lightening in the  distance.  Lasted about 5 minutes.  Took some pictures.

25+ orange lighted objects passed in sky (no sound) on 3/6/2020 at 7:45 PM.   ((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-06 19:45:00;3-4 minutes;25+ orange lighted objects passed in sky (no sound) on 3/6/2020 at 7:45 PM. On Friday night at about 7:45 PM I took notice to numerous orange colored lights passing by our property in the sky.  The objects appeared round in shape.  My wife also viewed the lights and videotaped same with cell phone.  The objects made no noise as they passed.  At times they would appear in view at 3 or 4 in single file.  They appeared to come from a westward location and headed in an eastern direction. There were no flashing lights on the objects, just a lone orange colored light for each object.  We have to say we saw at least 25 of these objects .It was snowing lightly at the time of the event. There was a delay in reporting because we awaited any report appearing in the local news (none seen).  I have been employed in law enforcement for 36 years. My wife is in the education field.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
