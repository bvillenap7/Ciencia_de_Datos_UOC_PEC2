Bright blue-green flash lights up early morning sky like dayllight.;2000-09-09 02:30:00;5 seconds;Bright blue-green flash lights up early morning sky like dayllight. I was sitting on the front porch of my home. The exact time was around 2:30 or 3:30am. There was a brilliant blue-green flash that lasted about 5 seconds. I thought a power transformer blew up - but there was no sound. On the National Police frequency I heard different departments talking about the flash also. Some departments I heard talk about the flash were from nearby counties. The flash was so bright it lit up the whole area like daytime. I've seen meteors/fireballs before, but none lit up the area like whatever caused this flash. I work as shift leader at a local factory. I'm an Amateur radio operator and radio communications is my hobby. I scanned the local aircraft frequencies, but there was no traffic in the area at the time of the flash. I didn't notice any radio interference on any of the VHF/UHF frequencies I was scanning at the time of the flash. ((NUFORC Note:  Several other reports of this event at 0330 hrs. on Saturday, 09SE00.  Several individuals were adamant in stating that the brightly lighted object stopped and hovered for at least a few seconds.  PD));40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849

A friend and I got out of the car and watched it move behind the trees, went back in the car and as soon as we sat in the seats a huge flat flash moves in front of us at the top part of the sky with something in the front, a blue color it had 2 dark blue colored roundish shapes in the front of it.
