Star Like Static Object Blinked (Red/Pink/White) randomly in Place for about 20min then Left once i drove to see it up close!;2012-11-06 23:40:00;25 minutes;Star Like Static Object Blinked (Red/Pink/White) randomly in Place for about 20min then Left once i drove to see it up close! On election night 6 Nov 2012 I'm Closing Curtains behind my dinning room and getting ready to Sleep when i noticed these Red, Pinkish, White Light that made me think they were FIREWORKS due to the Intense and Clear Brightness of these Static Blinking Star like lights that moved in a Random Circular Pattern for a very Long time,  woke my wife up amd pointed it out how Low and Stationary this STAR like object was underneath the Clouds in the distance.  I got my camera and changed in order to find out how far this Object was.  Once in truck drove towards Lancaster Avenue and saw Object then it dissapeared once i arrived near Sturgis Pretzel Factory. (Did not take Pictures because thought i could get a CLOSER Film + Picture of it...BIG Mistake);40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
