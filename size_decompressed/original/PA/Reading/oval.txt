Very high flying and super fast;2002-11-29 04:55:00;20 seconds;Very high flying and super fast I was looking at stars with binoculars because the atmosphere was very clear. Looking south of my location in Reading, I saw what looked to be about as big as one of the stars I was viewing (it was super high so it looked as small as a star). usually a very high plane or jet would look to be moving slowly and take a while to cover such a distance viewing it from down here on the ground. This object covered my area of viewing in a matter of seconds. It was not a meteorite. It was out of sight in about 5 to 7 seconds. It was very white bright, with no flashing lights. It was moving in a northern direction. I was viewing the sky from my yard at the time. Please see my other report that happened about 10 minutes later. I've seen other objects from this location in the past too.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
