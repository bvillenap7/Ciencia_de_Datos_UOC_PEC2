I turned around just to see if any of our freinds might have been walking behind us. There weren't any. When I turned around I couldn't help noticing a huge triangular object in the sky kind of comming up behind us. I yelled at mt freind in awe and said something like LOOK! He said, what is it? I said something in the terms of, It's gotta be a UFO!! The object was huge, atleast one hundred feet or more tip to tip. It made no sound what so ever and was fairly evenly lit by a bright light on each corner. It hoovered above us as we watch it for quite a while and we decided to leave. It went in the same direction as we did so we ran to get home. I lived near the spot where we saw it. My freind went home the long way to avoid the object. When I got home, my mother asked why I was home so late and I said I didn't know. About 10 minutes later, my brother came in the door. He was at his girlfreinds house up the street. He said look, we saw this earlier. He and his girlfreind were laying in her yard just watching the stars and whatever else and he said a huge triangular object went right over them. High in the sky, of course. He described the exact same thing that I saw and he had a picture that he drew and it was, the exact same thing I saw. It was in the news papers the very next day. A lot of other people saw it too. My freind never remembered the incident when I saw him a couple of weeks later. I had night mares for years of being in a totaly white room with no corners, and a dark object would come closer and closer to me towards my face and then I would wake up. I was stressed for a long time for some reason and for years I was convinced it was from seeing the craft. I had a small round scar on my left legg that I could never explain. It looks like a vaccination mark now. I had my throat checked once for a problem I was having. The doctor went through my nose with a scope to go down to see my throat. He asked me through the course of the check up what did I get opporated on for in my nose. I said I never got an opperation in my nose. He said you had to and I replied, I would know if I did. I had my nose courtorized when I was a child but never an opporation. That was the end of the conversation. I'm not saying I was abducted, but with all the things that happened to me, I sure thought about it. If I had the money, I'd get a whole body scan just to check it out. I would like to say that I and other people I know and talk to, beleive in u.f.o.'s. This is the reason I do. Also, about two years ago, I ran into! an old employer of mine at a store. We were looking for a good ufo movie and my old boss replied, I shouldn't tell you this, but I saw a u.f.o. years ago. Around 1970. He described the EXACT same thing we saw. And best of all, the same time frame. He lived behind the mountain where the school was located. He and his father saw the same one we did. Everything I mentioned here is 100% true. I'm 47 now and was 16 then, I recall everything I mentioned as if it happened last night. There is no forgetting. You can watch all the movies you want, but you just can't comprehend the feeling, of seeing something so large so quiet just floating in the sky abouve you, unless you saw it yourself.

Bright triangle shaped object flies over gas station.;2006-04-15 21:00:00;1 minute or less;Bright triangle shaped object flies over gas station. A friend and I were pulling into a gas station and turned off the car. We then saw a triangle shaped object, with three bright lights coming out of the bottom, fly extremely fast over the gas station. It was very very low and heading west. I thought for a second it was going to crash. It was completely silent, no sound at all. We both said at the same time, Did you see that?! and we jumped out of the car. It was about a mile and a half away within a few seconds. We were both pointing when it started flashing red, white, and blue lights extremely fast. It looked like fireworks. It reminded us of cameras going off all at once, over and over. It then disappeared in the distance. No one, as far as I know, saw it but us.  It was flying too low to be a plane, too quiet to be a helicopter, and too fast to be a blimp. What else is left?  My friend and I didn’t even believe in this stuff until we saw it.

Coll, clear, with a pale blue sky tinged by a golden sunset. I was coming from a local department store and as I walked up an inclined parking lot to my car,I looked up and there it was!  To my surpyise was a large long object.dark gold in color and above the store,or really above the bypass behind it.It was still,heavy,and ominous.  I watched in disbelief and asked a women getting into her mini-van if she saw it too?  Her answer after observation was affirmative,and she watched it rather disturbadly and drove away.It moved very slowly and without a sound.it was in the Southern Sky,and went southeast.  As it crossed the horizen I could make out that it was a Triangle.It's surface glistened dimly in the light.  I could see no propulsion systems,windows,or lights.Of couse it was silent.This sighting has haunted me daily for four years.In subsiquent research the Triangle was exactly like the ones I have researched on You Tube,and particularly like! the Belgian Flap of 1997!

Triangular Craft Spotted Above Treeline in Reading;2021-02-03 22:40:00;Five minutes;Triangular Craft Spotted Above Treeline in Reading I was driving to pick my daughter up when yellow, white, and silver blinking lights caught my attention. I looked up and saw a triangular craft hover/flying towards the mountains. I thought it odd because airplanes don't fly that low as this was about a 1/4 above the treeline. I was going to pull over and take a picture but it disappeared before I could do so.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
