bright light approaching aircraft, aircraft responds with something;1991-05-10 16:00:00;3;bright light approaching aircraft, aircraft responds with something I'm not sure if it was 91 or 92, but it was in early April.  I got off the schoolbus and started walking down my street toward home.  It was a clear afternoon, and I noticed an aircraft flying at a high altitude. It made barely any noise, but the sun was glinting off of it so it attracted my attention. It looked like an ordinary passenger jet, except that maybe the wings were a bit longer and thinner than I would have expected, but not by much. I watched the aircraft as I was walking down the street.  Eventually I noticed a bright light, which changed in intensity a bit, but did not appear to have any noticeable shape.  It approached the aircraft at slight angle, coming up from behind it on what looked like an intercepting at a greater but steady velocity. After about a minute, a small contrail curled off the opposite side of the aircraft, and travelling much faster than the craft itself, curled around the front of the aircraft and headeded toward the light.  When the small contrail had quickly closed half the distance to the light, the light instantaneously changed speed and direction to a course five times as fast as it had been moving and almost 90 in a different direction.  It disappeared from view within a second or two without approaching the horizon.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Three bright objects, each made up of at least 3 lights in a horizontal row, zig-zagged slowly and climbed into the clouds.;2000-11-07 03:30:00;00:10;Three bright objects, each made up of at least 3 lights in a horizontal row, zig-zagged slowly and climbed into the clouds. I initially saw two bright lights to the east of my location.  Movement was barely discernable.  They appeared to be moving slowly to the WNW.  Their direction was erratic, short zig-zag movements both horizontally and vertically (like the etch-a-sketch toy in unskilled hands).  The second one (farther away) dropped below my line of sight, I think.  I watched the first one until it was about at a 45 degree elevation. Then it disappeared, probably into the clouds.  (I couldn't see any stars.) The second one rose back into view and behaved the same as the first until it too disappeared into the clouds.  Then I scanned the area and spotted another over the city of Reading.  It was quite low and initially blended into the city lights.  It too zig-zagged and climbed into the clouds.  Each object appeared to have at least three light sources.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849

Three Silvery White Clouds appear on the Left side of the Light then on the Right 3 rays of light show with the middle one looking like 2 rays attached to each other shortly after that a HUGE Silvery Explosion took place in the sky this explosion was about the same size as the moon with no flickering of any kind it just turned on 3 to 4 seconds done.  In my opnion this was a UFO/Satellite Battle/Test because i reported this on a British UFO site by mistake & 2 weeks later alot of Satellite Hoopla was being talked about in the BRITISH news???;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
Brillant Orange glow lasting for minutes;2007-10-07 18:30:00;2 minutes;Brillant Orange glow lasting for minutes I steeped out on my back porch to smoke a cigarette and looking across the sky to the NW, I noticed an unusually bright orange light hanging in the sky several miles away.   Being in aviation over half my life, my first thought was an airplane reflecting the setting sun.  I was using a power line as a reference, I watched the light drop below the power line.  It then moved quickly to the East and faded out.   Within a few seconds, it reappeared and was a little brighter this time.  The light continued in an Eastern direction for about 15 seconds before completly fading away.   During this sighting, there were no noises associated with normal aircraft activity.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
Two red blinking lights in Reading, PA.;2012-03-27 21:00:00;45 seconds;Two red blinking lights in Reading, Pa. Driving down 13th St in front of the high school I seen two flashing red Lights I was confused at the intersection because of the flashing red lights ahead.  Then I realized they were in the sky going west to east, across the road I was driving on, very low.  The lights were close together but not too close.  Enough to say fit 3 or 4 more lights the same size but were perfectly.  Parallel to each other And the lights did not fade out they just turned off in a manor that is unusual,  giving the time span in between each blink.  No sound of an aircraft was heard. Nor was there any glare Protruding or emitting from the lights.  The lights proceeded to go behide the tree tops in the direction of the mountains. I wanted to follow to get a closer look at what it really was but was afraid what I might see to be what I thought it was.  Plus I had my 9 yr old in the back and didn't what to draw his attention to it.  So I turned down Spring st in the opposite direction of the craft. It was still visible as I left it.  On another note I have notice a light like an airport spot light or something coming from behind these mountains that I've never seen before. Strobing the sky.  That was the night before and the night prior.  But when I went home I looked at the mountains and didn't see that light nor did I tonight.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
Light  moving in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2012-07-09 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;Light  moving in the sky. The house was getting quiet as people started to go to bed.  I was up from the south to visit a Friend. I wanted him to join me for a smoke outside but he was already asleep.  As I went outside, I stepped out the front door and heard a “flame in motion” sound.  Since we lived near a small airport, the sound didn’t alarm me.  My area around, on the porch with arch like roof. A field in front of me that turns to woods. .  But to my amazement, I turned around to what seemed like a LIGHT right above me. This object was about 100 yards away and was in motion moving away from me.  It was a Light,  Not an object projecting a light, but it was just a “ball” of light.  Not a Fire Ball that might go out at some point or have no direct path.  The object moved over the hill side out of my eye sight.  And no more noise or light.  More info about this light.  The light was white, and bright in the middle.  It moved at a slow speed, 50 mph, with a straight path.  The size would have to been 20 feet circumference.

To whom it may concern: I'm a newspaper reporter and was instructed by an FAA employee to contact NUFORC with a question presented by one of our readers. On Sunday, Jan. 6, at about 9:15 p.m., the reader let his dog out and when he locked in the northern sky he saw six or eight orange lights moving across the sky from west to east. I checked with the FAA at Reading Regional Airport and they said they had three or four controllers on that night and that no one had reported any strange sightings. We're curious if other sightings have been reported to you.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
Possible UFO Sighting over eastern  Pa 10:05 PM.;2013-04-01 22:05:00;1 second;Possible UFO Sighting over eastern  Pa 10:05 PM. I'm sorry this happened today because it might seem like a joke but it isn't.   I had just gotten home and had left the dog in the bakcyard.  I looked up in the sky and was amazed by how clear it was and how bright the stars were.  I watched a jet flying east to west in the distance and heard its low engines.  Just then flying north to south, or maybe northeast to southwest, I saw what I thought was another jet.  It had two white lights, one brighter and one smaller very close together right behind, just like a jet.  But these lights moved incredibly fast.  And they left no trail like a meteor would, just two lights moving way faster than a jet would and then they disappeared in the middle of the sky.  A jet couldn't move that fast that high up and I don't think I've ever seen a meteor leave no streak or just be two lights that close together.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849

Orangish colored bright light traveling slowly over Reading, PA.;2015-07-24 21:00:00;5 minutes;Orangish colored bright light traveling slowly over Reading, Pa. I took the dog out around 9:00pm.  I always look up at the moon and stars and when I did that night I saw a single orangish colored bright light to the west moving very slowly towards the south.  I live close to the local airport, so my first thought was that it was a small plane in a landing pattern, but realized that this was a single bright orangish colored light rather than the bright white landing light or the smaller red and green navigation lights on planes.   I then thought that maybe it was a helicopter but again eliminated that for the same reason.  The sky was perfectly clear so there were no clouds to get a good reference of how high or far away the light may have been but I felt like it was maybe a thousand feet up and maybe a mile or so away.  I heard no sound that would be associated with a plane or helicopter, but again I really wasn't sure how far away the light really was.  As the light traveled slowly towards the south it got smaller and higher in the sky until it disappeared.  I don't think it blinked out but rather just got out of my sight due to the distance.  I was able to see it for about 5 minutes.  I'm a retired supervisor and have lived close to the local airport for over 20 years, so I know what airplanes and helicopters look like, as they come and go from the airport during the day and night, and this light was like nothing that would be from a plane or helicopter.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
Twinkling lights in erratic motion.;2015-08-05 01:00:00;10 minutes;twinkling lights in erratic motion. Early morning, I was sitting outside and witnessed a oval like light in the sky just above the tree line.  The light was clearly twinkling similarly to an airplanes signal, with red and white flashes.  The object was stationary in the sky with spurts of erratic motion, never leaving the general vicinity of the original sighting.  I clearly observed this unidentified object for a full 10 minutes.  I am an intelligent person and cannot explain what I saw.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
