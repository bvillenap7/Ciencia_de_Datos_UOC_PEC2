Circle in the sky;2019-09-23 07:00:00;5 minutes;Circle in the sky It was right before 7am when I was at work and went outside to look at the sunrise.  This is when I noticed a small dark circle moving slowly around the clouds.  I ran to grab my phone, and proceeded to record the object.  At first the ball was not moving and was stationary in the sky.  It began to move slowly and change direction a few timeS.  At first I thought it was a drone, but it was too high and was a perfect circle.  A nearby plane around the same distance away also put into perspective of how big the circle really was.  As the circle began to go away from me, it began to speed up and moved away rather quickly.  I was left stunned and confused, because I have no idea what this could be.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849

It was consistent perhaps a tight cluster of very bright lights.  We have never seen this type of phenomenon before.  I videoed it after surveilli8it with 10 power binos.  No reasonable explanation.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
