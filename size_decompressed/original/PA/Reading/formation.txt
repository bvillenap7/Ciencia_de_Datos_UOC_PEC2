It was night and my boyfriend and I were looking at mountain and were amazed that car lights could be seen when the lights, 5 in a row, moved slowly off mountain toward Reading Airport. The lights stayed in a row which made us think it was one structure, maybe blimp or something.  We waited for helicoptor noise or some noise but never heard anything as they became closer. Suddenly the 5 lights all got a little brighter and spread out and up very fast and disappeared. We were terrified and called Reading airport but they said they saw nothing and had no blimp or helicopters in area.  We searched the newspaper the next day but no one else seemed to have seen it.  I don't tell too many people because it still frightens me to think about it.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849

Watched it for about 5 mins, as it was.  I wanna say was flashing but like light on an airplane or heli, but when I watched it just disappear right before my eyes, I knew that I just had seen something that wasn't a plane or helicopter.
