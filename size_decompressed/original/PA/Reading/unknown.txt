Sometimes seemed to stand still but moved in an unusual manner My wife and I (and a neighbor the 2nd time)witnessed on two occassions within a week around 10 PM, a single light source in the sky alternating colors of red, green, white and blue.  We could not see a shape, only a light in the sky that moved in a stange manner,sometimes stood still and continuously changed colors in a fairly consistent pattern but not in a blinking fashion.  The light was larger than a star and was located to the north-northeast of us in a range of 20 to 45 degrees above the horizon.  It sometimes appeared to move towards us and then away from us before moving and disappearing quickly off to the right (east).  The colors and brightness and movement were unlike anything I had ever seen in the sky.  It appeared quite close at times but did not make a noise.

Red/orange lights in triangle shape east of Reading, Pa.;2014-08-17 22:30:00;3-4 minutes;Red/orange lights in triangle shape east of Reading, Pa. While walking my dog this night I noticed a steady red or orange light in the sky that just stayed in the same spot for a while.  It moved slightly one time behind some trees and was out of my sight, and I assumed it was a plane.   I continued my walk down the block and back and when I came to my driveway I now saw three of these lights in the same spot as the first forming a large triangle shape.  They just stayed in the same spots motionless.   As I stood there looking at them, the triangle shape they were in made a 360 degree circle then stopped and they remained motionless again.  I came in the house to get my camera and tell my friend to come look, and by the time we went back outside they were gone and I did not see them again as I looked throughout the next hour.

Very fast object moving quickly back and forth in the sky.;2017-02-23 19:30:00;4 minutes;Very fast object moving quickly back and forth in the sky. Saw a white with blue and red lights, blue and red lights flickered from red and blue.  It looked like some type of craft that moved as slot faster then anything I've seen in the sky before.  Craft was making a clear buzzing noise.  It would stop for a few seconds then move across the at very quick speeds.   After about 4 minutes of taking video it disappeared.  One short clip shows the bright craft with 3 other smaller white circular shapes.  After it disappeared, one light which looked like a shooting star flew over top so fast.  Faster than a shooting star a flew longer than a shooting star.   My mom was the first to notice this object and once I noticed it, I started video taping it.  Three other people stopped and asked if o saw the object plus the last white object that flew above.  I told them yes and showed them footage I got of the object.  I thought possible drone, however it seemed way to fast for a drone.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
