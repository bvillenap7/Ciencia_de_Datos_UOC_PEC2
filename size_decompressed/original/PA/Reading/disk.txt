This object was dimly lit though. It glowed a light orangish color. It also had no blinking lights. It looked to be shaped like a disk that came to a point at front and rear. It was also very high in the sky. It was very fast and moved from north to southeast when suddenly at one point the object turned at one point. It didn't turn gradually, instead, it darted off at about a 30 to 40 degree angle at a given spot. More like a slingshot. After it changed its direction it slowed down and then just darted out of sight.;40.3381900684932;-75.9470431506849
