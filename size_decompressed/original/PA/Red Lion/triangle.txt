I went out to have a smoke.  While standing outside, I saw these flashing blue lights, which  caught my eye.  At first i thought it was a small plane, but soon realized it wasn't. The craft was moving from the Southwest to Northeast and made no sound.  As I followed it, the blue lights seemed to go out.   I then saw a bright white and red light and realized the craft had stopped and turned in mid air.  As I watched it, it then shot straight up 100-200 ft sat there for a few seconds, and then started heading back to the Southwest. It was not moving away as fast as it had come, and i noted the blue lights were not flashing as fast either.  As the craft passed I could somewhat make out the size and shape.  It was larger than a car or truck but not by much.  The back was sloped where the blue lights were, and tapered toward the front of the craft. The craft was over some home across the street from my home and about 500ft high when it came from the Southwest.  This was not an airplane or Copter.  It stopped, spun around, shot straight up and moved with no sound.   I am former Air Force so i think I can distinguish between what is, and is not, an aircraft. This craft amazed me and did things no craft I am aware of can do. The blue lights were so intense and beautiful.  Like a blue you can't describe. If they were lights (?), they seemed to flash faster, or slower, as the craft's speed changed. I hope someone else saw this wonderful sight tonight!
