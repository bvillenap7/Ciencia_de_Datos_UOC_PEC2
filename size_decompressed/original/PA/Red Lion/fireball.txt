Three silent glowing objects seen in total over a 30 minute period starting at around 9:50pm.  The first was a red fireball that was traveling over the Winterstown area as seen from Red Lion near Route 24.  It appeared suddenly and as it approached the woods in the distance it went completely black, I could make out an almost stationary triangular object illuminated by the full moon.  It then continued to travel and as it drifted behind the tree line it again ignited a bright red. The second object was orange, rose from the horizon in the same area, went black as it rose and appeared to go up and around the moon from my perspective.  It then went almost straight down and dipped behind the horizon.  I was able to capture this on my cell phone on a short video. The third was again red and rose from a similar point of origin on the horizon.  Although all three had slightly different origin points they appeared to be coming from the same area.  This third and final object rose into the sky and flew in a large arch towards the main town of Red Lion.  Again, this was caught on video.  All 3 objects were accompanied by the sound of a dog barking in the distance, you can hear it clearing on the video of the third object. During the video my girlfriend and I are bouncing ideas off each other of what we are seeing. We feel it could have been Memorial lanterns, but at the same time with the lack of wind and their speed we are just unsure.;39.9056;-76.6055
