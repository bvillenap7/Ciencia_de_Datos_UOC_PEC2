Standing on the driveway, looking up at the stars, I noticed what we thought to be a satellite.  Tracking it moving Southeast across the sky, moving significantly faster than typical satellites observed in the past.   Suddenly it turned around, faster than any plane could have, and headed the other direction across the sky disappearing into the horizon line.;40.4371;-78.3639
