FIRST SEEN BY MY BROTHER.  CALLED OUR HOUSE AND MY HUSBAND AND I WENT OUT TO LOOK, AND SAW NOTHING.  3 MIN LATER MY BROTHER ARRIVED AND WE WENT BACK OUT SIDE.  WITHOUT BINOCULARS IT LOOKED LIKE A BRIGHT LIGHT.  I HAVE NEVER SEEN A UFO.  ALWAYS SAID I HAVE TO SEE ONE TO BELIEVE IT.  THERE IT WAS OVAL SHAPED WITH BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT ROTATING LIGHTS OF PURPLE, RED, YELLOW, ORANGE, GREEN AND BLUE.  i COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING.  I GOT SO EXCITED I HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK. I COULDN'T  STAY OUTSIDE.  MY BROTHER STATED, IT BROKE OFF INTO 3 SMALL ORBS BUT THE ORGINIAL REMAINING.  THEY HOVERED AROUND AND BECAME ONE AGAIN.  THE COLOR OF THE SMALL ONES WERE ORANGE.  MY BROTHER SHINED A HIGH POWERED LIGHT AT IT.  HE FLASHED 5 FLASHES 3 TIMES, THE FORTH TIME HE FLASHED 6 TIME AND THE LIGHTS OF THE UFO FLASHED OFF AND ON.  ALMOST AS THOUGH SIGNALING BACK.  AND THEN IT ZOOMED AWAY.  AND THEN 4 PLANES WERE FLYING IN THE AREA.  WELL, NOW I BELIEVE BECAUSE I SAW IT. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at the star, Sirius, which is very colorful.  It would be in the southwestern, and western, at the time indicated.
