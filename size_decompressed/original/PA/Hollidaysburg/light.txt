Spheres of red/orange lights.;2014-09-27 20:15:00;10-15 minutes;Spheres of red/orange lights. Approximately 8:15pm â€“ red/orange objects ranging from 2 to 14 at a time lasting approximately 10 minutes from the time they were noticed in the sky.  This same evening, the sunset an hour before and the rays of light were coming from the east rather than the west with the setting sun.  In addition, an arc of light was across the whole sky like a rainbow earlier in the evening.  The objects appeared to move closer and then would disappear only for more to reappear.  They also moved into what looked like formations and would then disperse.  By seeing them firsthand they were bright orange and red but in video or pictures that were taken, they are all white/gray.  The still photos of the images when zoomed in on appear to be some type of spacecraft. The sky was clear with no clouds.  It was quiet and they did not omit any noise. Police called but arrived after observation and objects had disappeared.  Not visible from other areas of the surrounding community.;40.4371;-78.3639
