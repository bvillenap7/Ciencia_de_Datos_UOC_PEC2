Strange that these lights were moving in formation.;2016-05-28 23:30:00;45 seconds;Strange that these lights were moving in formation. At or about 23:30 hrs on the 28th of May, 2016, my wife and I were on the back deck.  I looked up and saw what I thought was a satellite.  I see them all the time, but as I watched and saw a second light directly behind the first tracking in formation.  I have never seen a satellite do that nor do I think they would orbit them in such close proximity.   It was not the ISS I know because they are in a mission to inflate the new habitat.;41.9527;-75.5914
