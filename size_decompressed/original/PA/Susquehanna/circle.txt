Large clear orangish circle shaped object.;1997-07-22 22:00:00;approx.8minutes;Summary : Large clear orangish circle shaped object. While burning papers in an enclosed burner, I looked up at my garage roof and thought I had set it afire.Then i realized that what I wa seeing was something hovering at the peak of the roof and it was orange clear object about what I would say would be the size of a Volkeswagon beetle. It appeared to be at roof level and then went higher in the air, clearing the house roof and continuing across the street . It had come from the northeast and went southwest. I had my neighbor come out and she saw it as it was much higher in the sky and about 6 other people down the street were watching it also, but it was high in the sky to them also. Shapewise, it appeared to be circular, clear orange and just floating above garage roof. We, the observers range in the 30-48 age with two being teenagers. Our local police officer was called after it had gone thru and he informed me that about two months ago he had seen an object that he could not explain.;41.9527;-75.5914
