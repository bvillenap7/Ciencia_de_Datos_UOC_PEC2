28-30 Lighted objects coming up over the city hovering and almost coliding with one another. Red lights escorting them. Vanished.;1998-01-01 07:30:00;20 minutes;Summary : 28-30 Lighted objects coming up over the city hovering and almost coliding with one another. Red lights escorting them. Vanished. 7:30 pm witnessed over 25 hovering, soundless crafts. Bright glassey lights where coming from the objects. Low to the ground, spining, slow moving. Red lights were escorting crafts. Traveling in straight lines over the city, then dispersing on there own. A fighter plane flew overhead, and they all disappeared. 3 witnesses, sober, stable women. I am 37, and not crazey. All the dogs in the neighborhood were barking. Reported to the airport. They saw nothing. Found that hard to believe, because they were coming one after the others in regular sequences. I do not believe in UFO's, so I am looking for a solution to what we saw. Called the radio stations, no sky shows that night.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

They were in a v formation (20,000 Ft. +) moving very quickly across the sky from West to East. I was taking a leak on the side of my friends house, when I happened to notice something strange in the sky.  There were 8-10 faint star-like objects around 3-4 magnitude moving in a tight formation across the sky. They were in a V or boomerrang like formation 20,000 Ft. + high traveling from West to East very quickly across the sky.  There was no deviation from their course, just straight line movement.  The total time of observance was only 10 seconds max.  It almost seemed that the background of the formation was distorted in a way.  I immediately ran back in to tell my friend of the sighting, and he had told me that I was clearly shaken up by the ordeal.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

4 lights moving in triangular formation at low altitude over Squirrel Hill, PA.;2013-04-06 22:39:00;1:01;4 lights moving in triangular formation at low altitude over Squirrel Hill, PA. Four objects were seen form about a 30 degree angle.  They traveled above the trees through the night sky flying southeast or south.  Three circular lights appeared to be moving through the sky while maintaining a triangular formation.  Shortly after, one other light came from behind and followed the other lights.

Crafts zipping across the sky in Pittsburgh, PA.;2014-01-08 01:00:00;Very fast;Crafts zipping across the sky in Pittsburgh, Pa. I step out from my job and just happened to look up and saw a formation of about 4-5 crafts zip across the sky sort of like if birds flew by but much higher than birds fly.  The formation looked like a bird migration (diagonal) but I've never seen or heard of birds that glow in the dark.  It appeared as if the one on the rear of the formation started to break from the formation so they slowed down until it realigned and sped right back up.  I watched until I could not see them anymore.  The sighting lasted for about 30-45 seconds.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Bright orange lights in formation.;2014-04-09 04:00:00;2 minutes;Bright orange lights in formation I was driving when I witnessed two bright orange lights moving in parallel silently low across night the sky.   The lights moved in perfect unison as if part of a single craft but too far apart to be anything I’ve ever seen.   Also the angle of the lights was wrong as one was above and in front of the other.  (The best way to describe it is fully extend your arm in front of you with your hand at a 45 degree angle.  As far as possible extend your thumb and little finger.  At the tip of your thumb and the tip of your little finger would approximate the formation).   It was 4:00 AM in the morning.   I stopped in the middle of the street and I reached for my phone to either call someone to corroborate what I witnessed and to take a picture.   By the time I woke the phone from sleep, the lights had vanished.  I’m relieved sort of to see other similar reports I know I’m not nuts.  I’m not a UFO buff so I’d accept any plausible explanation.

Two stars moving closer emitting a sparkling, shimmering object.;2014-11-11 05:00:00;10:00;Two stars moving closer emitting a sparkling, shimmering object. while lying under the stars holding my neighbor's toy poodle next to a campfire, alone as he ran to the local store…I observed 2 lights growing brighter and what appeared to be closer coming from the west toward me.  They were parallel to each other, left and right, and completely level with one another.  As they appeared to grow closer, the left-to-right space between them increased  but they always remained level to one another.  once they became about 5-6 thumbs apart at arm's length, a sparkling light departed from them.  it looked like a firework with multi-colored sparkling lights in constant and consistent intensity and activity. red, blue, green, white.  sparkling and lively. it traveled off to the south with a steady and constant speed/trajectory. afterwards,  the two lights (star-like. if only gazing up quickly one would never realize their position was changing) seemed to back up, becoming more distant.  i said to them what is your intention over and over again.  i never saw the shimmering light again.  the two stars never deviated from their relate position to one another.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
5 red lights hovering over airport.;2014-11-11 18:00:00;10 minutes;5 red lights hovering over airport. My father and I drove to Walmart in West Mifflin, I saw a group of strange lights over the airport, at first i thought it was a plane until I noticed they weren't moving, nor were the lights blinking.  The 5 lights seemed to be randomly scattered, then 3 of them made a triangle shape.  It then looked like the triangle turned in the sky, as one bottom light eclipsed the other.. then one by one, the lights slowly disappeared until one remained and that slowly faded away.  I knew it couldn't be a plane or helicopter.  I thought it may be Chinese lanterns..   But then I saw somebody saw something similar EXACTLY one month before me, same time and everything...that can't be a coincidence.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
5 orbs appeared all with a reddish orange light.  There were 4 smaller 1 lrg.  No noise.  Flying over shopping center.;2017-08-26 21:15:00;~5 minutes;5 orbs appeared all with a reddish orange light.  There were 4 smaller 1 lrg.  No noise.  Flying over shopping center. I was driving East on Penn Ave..  As I approached Club One at 6325 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15206, I noticed initially 2 red balls in the sky, as if a group of helicopters were approaching.  Then I noticed 2 more.  There appeared to be 1 leading and the other 3 following.  But, they made no noise.   I pulled over in the parking lot that adjoins the gym near the McDonald's.  As I parked, I noticed them flying towards the townhomes across the street toward the Shadyside area.  I took a few pictures.  I was upset I couldn't get video because I just returned from vacation and didn't have enough space for video.   Then a larger one appeared which was about 2.5x's there size.  But I didn't think I captured it because of the lights from the McDonald's sign.   I also captured the 4 smaller ones, and unbeknownst to me, in the 1 picture with the illuminated McDonald's sign, if you enlarge it, you can see the shape of the actual object and the red going from back to front in a wave like  design.  But behind it, a few days later I noticed a blue glow.   When I enlarged the picture there appears to be a blue circular craft. And between the 1st one in that picture and blue craft their appears to be an irregular, rectangular shaped object that is not illuminated.  So there were possibly 7 total objects.   I have attached the 3 photos.  Please magnify for detail. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I am the 8/26 report from Pittsburgh- 5 orbs in a formation. .. time of event shld be bwtn 21:00-21:30 instead of 15:10 … ((END ADDENDUM));40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

We excitedly told a table of four to get over here ufo! As they moved on, fist one then a second stopped and were static blending in as stars. The others kept moving. Then suddenly the two that stopped sped up to the others. Their light green to light red lights slowly faded as they turned west.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
