It did not have any wings, fins, or propulsion devices that I could see.   We were travelling on Interstate 79 towards Pittsburgh.   It was travelling in a westerly direction and it was the speed it was travelling that caught my eye.   My husband couldn't see it as he was driving.   I watched it until it was out of sight.  I have never seen anything in the sky that was that quick.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
