Weird object (shaped like plastic bag) moving across sky.;2010-10-18 16:00:00;About 5 minutes;Weird object (shaped like plastic bag) moving across sky. I was sitting at a table trying to get my computer to work while I was at my dad’s work building around 4:00 PM (or 16:00 PM military time).  I looked out the window and seen something moving through the sky.  I was watching it out of boredom, and I thought it kind of looked like a plastic bag.  Then I continued watching it, and I noticed it would go into the clouds.  So then I knew it couldn’t be a plastic bag because they just aren’t that big.  I walked and sat closer to the window to get a better view, and I watched it go all the way across the sky.  It was see through, a whitish tint, and a darker edge.  It moved weird (up, down, sideways, and circular motions) slowly across the sky (it started out on the right side of my vision, and moved to the left).  Then I went to go see my dad to ask him something, and I also brought him out to see what I had seen.  By this time it was gone (4:10 PM / 16:10 PM military time).  There was someone else in the room wit! h me, but they were reading while I was watching it.  I'm really angry I left my phone over my friends house, so in short, I couldn't take pictures.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Cluster of white lights above Pittsburgh.;2012-12-12 17:45:00;3 minutes;Cluster of white lights above Pittsburgh My wife saw it first and pointed it out to me.  Over the next few minutes we watched a strange formation of lights that changed shape (or formation?)... morphed several times.  At first I thought it was a huge flock of geese (much bigger than any natural flock), but as if the &quotgeese&quot emitted their own white light source.  From our point of view on Mt. Washington looking directly north the formation came into line of sight right above the confluence of the rivers at the point of downtown.  Approximate distance less than half a mile.  It then meandered above downtown going to the right and then to the left and back again before continuing in an eastern direction and picking up speed dramatically.  As it picked up speed it gained altitude and the lights flickered out of sight.  As for shape it changed, but it did maintain a V of sorts.  It resembled a cluster of stars.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
