A luminous object seen in pittsburgh for over a year with distinct  bright lights that can be seen by the naked eye.;2001-03-19 23:59:00;30 minutes;A luminous object seen in pittsburgh for over a year with distinct  bright lights that can be seen by the naked eye. The type of object that was seen was circular in shape.  It appears as a regular star from a quick look, but once you take the time to watch closely you can clearly see how intense the light coloration can be.  I recently aquired a long range telescope for Xmas so i decided to put it to good use.  As i adjusted the lense on my telescope i noticed two distinct rings around the object.  The object was luminating so brightly that it formed an outer ring around itself. It was very clear that the object was rotating very fast.  The upper half of the circle rotated to the right, and the lower half of the object rotated to the left.  The rings had a tendency to wave against eachother as if they were on some type of axis.  The object was moving at a fast rate from one side of my lense to the other.  I also had to adjust my lense down because the object was moving farther away.  The lights of the object were in very distinct colors of red, green , blue, white, and a slight orange.  The objects movements were very sporatic in the way it moved from left to right at a high rate of speed. This object has been seen by myself and my mother for quite some time now for at least a year and a half i have made various attempts to contact observatories and other support systems and have received no response or cooperation. I truly hope that this creates some type of interest and investigation. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect this may be a description of the star, Sirius.  Just a guess.

Circular object hovering over Route 60;2011-02-14 18:05:00;5 minutes;Circular object hovering over Route 60 On Monday February 14, 2011 a large white circular craft was spotted hovering over Route 60 Steubenville Pike in Robinson Twp, PA at 6:05 PM.   Cars were pulling off the road to watch this object and into parking lots.  People were getting out their vehicles to view this wedding ring-shaped object with white lights encircling it.   After 5 minutes, it just took off at a very high rate of speed straight up!   My IPhone camera could not focus on it to get a picture since it was already getting dark.   It was not a commercial plane or helicopter because it was a circular shape even though this is about 15 miles from the airport.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Two orange lights in sky over Pittsburgh;2012-09-19 22:00:00;less than 5 minutes;Two orange lights in sky over Pittsburgh September 20, 2012  I live in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, PA in the Borough of Castle Shannon, which is south of the city. On September 19, 2012, while talking on the phone in my sunroom, at around 10:00 p.m., I saw two, round, orange lights in the sky coming from the south east.  It looked so unusual because they were traveling so close to one another.  At first I thought it was a double reflection in the glass of my glass door.  This door is on the right side of my sunroom.  One light was following the other, moving at a slow steady pace.  The best I could describe them is two full moons, the size of which is when the moon is higher in the sky and not at the horizon.  These lights however were about as high as a low flying airplane going overhead. At first I thought maybe they were two airplanes heading towards the airport since they were in the part of the sky of the air traffic pattern I see so often.   However, the two lights were moving towards the north, which would be the direction of downtown Pittsburgh and not the airport.  I opened the glass sliding door to possibly hear a jet engine, but there was no sound at all.  It was a very clear night and you could see a lot of stars. I quickly hung up the phone and grabbed my camera which was close by.  I then went to another sliding door which faces the backyard to take pictures.  By this time it was directly over my backyard at about a 65 degree angle.  I didn’t have any lights on in the room I was in, so I frantically thought I was snapping pictures when I realized I was in video mode and was turning my camera off and on.  I then turned on the outside light to see my camera settings and then started taking a video clip.  The two lights were starting to fade in the distance and they were now looking white and not orange with my naked eye. I then went to my computer and started to search for any information I could find to see if anyone else saw this.  It was not reported in the news. Today I called KDKA, one of the local TV stations to see if anyone else reported seeing the two orange lights in the sky and they said no, I was the only one.  They would not be able to take me seriously unless they had more than one call. I checked a compass to see what the approximate directions the two lights traveling. To my best ability the lights I saw came from the southeast sky on the compass reading 27/150 traveling northwest on the compass reading 60/340. I would like to know what exactly I saw that night.  It was really strange.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

I saw a large red/orange circle about the size of a large, hot-air balloon hoover over the trees across from my boyfriend's apartment during dusk, located on West Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15226.  It appeared and within seconds disappeared down over the trees.   These trees are located high on the hill that line West Liberty Avenue in the Brookline area of Pittsburgh, PA.

Four orange-red lights over Pittsburgh, PA dropping smaller orange lights.;2014-01-01 19:30:00;15 minutes;Four orange-red lights over Pittsburgh, PA dropping smaller orange lights. On New Years Day, 1-1-14 at about 7:30pm EST, I stepped out onto my front porch.  I live about 5 miles north of downtown Pittsburgh, PA.  I just happened to look up at the sky (there were no stars this night) and saw two orange-red lights slowly moving through the sky side by side.  I thought it was a plane at first.  The two lights then separated from each other and slowly moved apart and then stopped completely and just hovered in the air.  Then, two more orange-red lights appeared right in the area of the original two.  There were now four orange-red lights hovering in the air, not moving at all and all were approximately the same size but, one of the original two lights was the biggest of all four.  Three of the four lights began disappearing and reappearing in roughly the same spot over the next 5 to 10 minutes.  During this time I used my compass on my IPhone and found that the objects were in the southeast sky (I also got some of the lights on video b! ut, it is a bit grainy).  The entire time these objects were disappearing and reappearing, one of the lights, the biggest one of the four, remained illuminated and appeared to slowly grow in size.  Then the large steady orange-red light began dropping smaller orangish balls of light from it.  It dropped about three smaller orange colored lights, which would travel straight down and then disappear after 2 or 3 seconds.  After this occurred, all four of the lights illuminated and moved slowly north, with three of them disappearing again.  The large steady orange-red light traveled out of direction with the other three and headed almost exactly in the direction I was standing at in front of my house.  When it began getting close enough where I could see the object really growing in size and see that there was more to the object than just the orange light, it disappeared.  This same light then reappeared about 30 seconds later, dropped one more orange colored light from it and ! completely disappeared. I watched this area of the sky for the next 20 minutes and may have briefly seen an orange light but, nothing like what I first witnessed.  I did see several helicopters in this area in the next 20 minutes but, I am not sure if the two are related.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

But seeing it having bright red light and noticed it was getting larger and larger.  It was circular!  It was bright red.  Now, the strange thing was that around its paremeter, it had a softer red glow.   i pulled over,but could not get out for there was some cars going down the road.  However, the redness dissapated gradually, leaving the object just black,descending at a normal speed...not like a fast crash landing.  I have never seen anything like this before.  The area it was going down was toward Jefferson Hills in southwestern pa.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Slow moving orange ball shaped objects fling from east to west across the sky.;2015-04-12 21:00:00;night;Slow moving orange ball shaped objects fling from east to west across the sky. I notice these orange ball shape things in the sky about 9PM at night. there were six of them a row.  Travelling from east to west extremely slow. They were close together . A medical helicopter flew under them travelling north to south and an airplane flew behind them from south to north.  They travelled so far across the sky and one at a time started to go straight up and disapeared in the sky.  It lasted about ten to twenty minutes.  The seventh one showed up some distance behind the six.  At about 9:30PM only one showed up doing the same as the rest.   At 9:45PM another did the same.  They were all orange in color and round like balls. It was the slowness of there movement that caught our sight.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

There was one in the front that appeared to be higher then the other two.  Two of them were traveling at the same height and were in a straight line with one in the front and the other one behind it.   They seem to stay the same distance apart for the entire time we saw them.  They were traveling northwest.   The objects made no sound and had no lights on them.

Still except once made a small triangle. Maybe some orange lights. Disappeared by shrinking. I saw a red light in the sky that was too large to be a planet as I was heading to the store.  To get a better look (because I was convinced I was looking at a plane or drone) I drove to view the object better.  It was late, between 10:30 pm and 11:00pm.  I pulled onto a dark street that overlooked a field were Kelton Elementary School once stood.  As I watched, What I 1st thought was moving was in fact still.  The object seemed to be glowing red (sometimes I thought I saw orange).  The size kept changing..it seemed to shrink a bit. At one point the red light moved, slightly in a triangle shape. The red light was too far into the sky to be a drone.  I did not notice any other lights in the sky, but for stars.  It was making me crazy that I had no one to witness this, and my cell phone was dead.  I suddenly saw 2 teenage girls in the field to my left.  I shouted down to them and asked if they too could see the light from where they stood (I was up higher on the street, and the field was below me).  At 1st they could not see it because they were looking in the wrong direction.  Once they spotted it, they both yelled...what is that.  All the sudden it began to shrink in size until it was gone..about 3 seconds.  They both started shouting what was that..thanked me for showing to them..and I drove off.  The light was too far away to be a drone and way too far in the sky.  Too see my vantage point, you can google Key Stone Oaks High School,  My Lebanon, PA.  I was parked on Delwood Ave. in Dormont, PA.  I'd say I was looking toward the Southern Sky when I saw it.  This is driving me crazy!!  What did I see?;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Bright fast moving object disappeared into cloud then the cloud disappeared.;2018-07-28 23:45:00;~5 minutes;bright fast moving object disappeared into cloud then the cloud disappeared. On July 28th, 2018, my son and I were sitting on my back porch talking.  I happened to look up at the sky and I noticed a fast moving, bright object moving quickly across the sky.  The object was round and very bright.  It did not have any blinking lights on it, like planes do. The object was moving from the SW to the SE.  My son who is an adult also saw the object.  The sky was fairly clear except for a few big puffy clouds.  We could see very well as there was a full moon.  When the object came very close to this one cloud there was a bright flash of light as it appeared to enter the cloud.  It appeared to almost spark.  We never saw it exit the cloud and then the oddest part was the cloud that it entered totally disappeared.  It took probably less than 3 mins for this cloud to evaporate, we could see it disappearing. The other clouds that were in the sky stayed the same.  There was not any wind or storms in the area when this happened.  The other odd thing was several dogs started barking very loudly when this was happening.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Circular UFO resembling a Roomba hovered 50yds behind our house, just over the neighbor’s house;2020-08-08 23:30:00;1 hour;Circular UFO resembling a Roomba hovered 50yds behind our house, just over the neighbor’s house 11:30pm, a great night for star gazing from the back patio. I’m showing off my astronomy skills so my girlfriend asks “what is that star?” I look at it and it’s really really high up to be a plane or a helicopter. It was whiteish with seemingly red flashes. I must have been staring at it for ten straight minutes and it begins dancing in the sky! It still look like a star at this point but the movements were totally unnatural, up, down, left, sideways, diaganol, and the speeds it must have been moving at weren’t possible.  That’s when it happened. As we’re staring at the first UFO, a second UFO appears hovering maybe two streets behind our house, at a height of a 4 story building. We got an incredible view of it because it has flown so close. My best description would be that it looked Roomba (robot vacuum cleaner) hovering in the air. It was too dark to accurately report a color. Looked darker and metallic maybe. It was circular and seemingly to totally flat! on top and bottom. I would guesstimate that it wasn’t very large, maybe the size of a small circular coffee table.  It wasn’t rotating at all. I could tell because it had this bright blinking red light like a security camera and some dimmer white lights built in, but the lights weren’t spinning and the red flashing light was aimed right at us the entire time. This creeped us out because it almost looked like it knew we were looking and was looking back at us. Moving so so slow through the sky. At first I thought a neighbor kid might have a drone, but as it did a fly by, I quickly realized no drone would look like that. There were no propellor, a very light whooshhhhhhhhh sound was made, and it glided through the air but so so slowly. Felt like 5 mph. This part of the experience last 2 minutes or so, but it was enough to scare us to go inside. I looked over at my girlfriend and we (sane and rational intellectuals) both sat there trying to grasp what we just witnessed. It re! ally didn’t feel real. After a few minutes, a collection of ab! out 3 mo re star looking lights appeared in the sky. Again, very high in the sky, red/white in color, variations of different movements but mostly stationary.  Background: Me: Male, 28, Pennsylvania.
