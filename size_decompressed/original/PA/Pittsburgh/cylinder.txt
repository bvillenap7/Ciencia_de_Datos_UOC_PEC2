While looking at the night sky, I noticed that one of the stars was moving around. I watched the star move vertically, horizontally, diagonally, in squiggle-y at very high rates of speed.  I broke out my telescope, and once I had the object sighted, I was shocked to see that the object was not a star, but rather a glowing, neon-green cylindrical shape - it was almost worm-like.  It continued to move sporadically, and was difficult to keep up with using the telescope, but each time I got it sighted again, it appeared exactly the same - glowing, neon-green and cylindrical. My wife, my son and I observed the object both with the naked eye and using the telescope as it continued move in this manner for over an hour and a half, so far...it's still out there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes self as having a considerable degree of technical training.  However, given that the event apparently lasted over a lengthy period of time, we feel that the first possibility to be ruled out would be a celestial body, either a star or planet.

Shiny capsule-shaped object seen over Pittsburgh;2016-07-22 18:45:00;2 minutes;Shiny capsule-shaped object seen over Pittsburgh As I was exiting my car in the driveway I saw a commercial airplane overhead making it's way to the Pittsburgh International Airport west of the city.  While looking at the plane I noticed a bright object below the plane traveling SE to NW, very slowly.  The object had no wings, was completely silent, and reflected the evening sun on what appeared to be a highly reflective surface.  Feeling the impulse to get a better look, I ran into my house to get my field binoculars for a closer look, but by the time I got back outside to the front of my house, it was nowhere in sight.  In my opinion, since it was traveling so slowly, it boggled my mind to have flown off so quickly by conventional methods.  This leads me to the conclusion that it wasn't anything conventional.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
