Saucer shaped object with orange lights.;1970-09-07 23:11:00;15 seconds;Saucer shaped object with orange lights. I can remember my UFO sighting as if it happened yesterday.  It was September 7, 1970. 11:10 p.m. I was about to start my senior year in high school.  We lived on a main highway just up from a very bad intersection where there were always accidents.  (Seven miles south of Pittsburgh, PA.)    At 11:10 p.m. that night I was leaving one upstairs room to go into the bathroom when I noticed a light somewhat flickering on the sheer draperies.  I assumed it was another accident and the lights of a tow truck.  I walked to the window to look down at the intersection and saw nothing.  I realized the light was coming from above.  I saw a huge circular metal craft with lights on the bottom.  It silently was hovering over my side yard at a slight angle so that I could only see the bottom of it.  It was just above the poplar tree tops along the border of our property.  I got a very close up look at it.  The bottom was slightly convex and a matte colored dark metal.   There were what looked like semi opaque tempered glass panels on the bottom.  Similar to a bathroom window.  You can see light but glass is not transparent.  Those panels are where the amber lights emanated.  They were on constantly but yet had a slight pulsating flicker to them.  For some reason, although I don't know why, I thought it was due to the power source of the craft.   I saw it for approximately 15 seconds as it hovered silently.  Then, faster than I could blink my eyes, it took off at a 45 degree angle to the west.  I was so terrified and will never forget what I saw.   I am sending a drawing explaining what it looked like to the email listed on your website.   If you call me I can give you exact locations and any other info you might want. If it has any relevance I don't know, but I am was not very far from Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

Bright light on small disc craft January & October 1992 Bates & McKee Pittsburgh, PA;1992-10-16 23:00:00;2 minutes;bright light on small disc craft January & October 1992 Bates & McKee Pittsburgh, PA This event occurred in south Oakland, near Bates & McKee Place, in Pittsburgh, PA. At about 11pm, on October 16, 1992, just after I reached up to turn off the lamp above my bed, my room was filled with dazzling yellow light, as bright as daylight.  Thinking a transformer had blown on the power lines on the next street, I got up to look out the window.  The light coming in between the curtains was warm to my skin, like sunlight.  The source of the light seemed to be very close to the window.  I, then, wondered if someone were on the roof of the neighboring warehouse, shining some sort of light around the roof.  Earlier in the day, I the dirigible had made a chugging sound, and this light source made no sound. When I opened my curtains, I saw a small, round, Oreo cookie-shaped vehicle, with a domed top and bottom.  In the center layer were small round lights on the outer ring of the craft.  The lights were amber in color.  From the bottom, emitted the singular, enormous light beam I had seen coming through my window.  The craft was about twelve to fifteen feet above my window and seemed to be about three and a half feet in diameter.  It was slowly ascending from the roof of the adjacent warehouse. By now, the light beam was no longer pointed towards my window, but had swung away from it, shining along the wall to the back garden and the adjacent warehouse that made an L-shaped wall around the garden.  It shone on the garden for a brief moment, then, swung back so that it was perpendicular to the craft.  Then, it retracted into the craft and the entire vehicle disappeared.  It had not made a sound. I woke my next door neighbor who reported seeing two beams of light coming through his window earlier, maybe 30 minutes before my experience.  He said that one beam had been blue and the other had been amber.  His windows faced the warehouse wall below where I saw the craft. He had been too tired to get out of bed to investigate. At this point, it was midnight and I could not account for an entire hour of my time. We went outside to see if we could see the lights or anything unusual, but we saw nothing.  No one on the street seemed to be looking surprized or paying any attention to the building where we had seen the light.  My neighbor climbed on the roof of the warehouse to see if there was evidence of something having been there, but he found nothing. The next day, the elderly woman who lived in the apartment directly above mine reported being frightened by the bright light shining in her window the night before.  She did not open the curtains to directly observe the light.  She had lived in the building for 40+ years and was terrified of this light that night, deciding, It was a sign from God!   Also, prior to seeing the light, my apartment had smelled strange, as if something hot and metallic were burning a bit.  I even checked my oven to see if the smell emitted from there, but it did not.  The other peculiar thing is that an electric alarm clock kept buzzing--not with the alarm sound, but with an electrical hum--in the hours directly preceding my sighting of this craft.  This clock was on a bureau beside the window from which I had seen the craft. Ten months prior to this experience, in mid-January 1992, a bright light had awoken me around 2am. (My room was normally very dark, sheltered from outside street lights.)   My boyfriend was staring at the light, but did not respond when I asked him what it was.  In this instance, I did not get up and investigate.  I was too frightened to get out of bed.  The light lasted a moment or two and went out. The next morning, my boyfriend did not recall seeing any light in the middle of the night. I think that this was the same craft perhaps visiting on two separate occasions.  The warehouse on which it was located stores food for a large local restaurant, but particularly houses many whole potatoes that are cut up to make a popular item at the restaurant.  My building and the warehouse were owned by the same person.  I did verify with the building maintenance personnel that no one had been on the warehouse roof with a light.  They all said that they had not been up there and that no light of that candle power was on the property, nor any other thing that could have looked like what was seen.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

Saw a disc shaped object from a distance to close.;1996-10-30 07:30:00;3-4 minutes;Saw a disc shaped object from a distance to close. Me and a coworker on the job in a company truck, he was driving. we crossed the Fort Pitt bridge leaving downtown Pittsburgh on route 28 north, we saw from a distance an object. The road headed us toward it and we at first thought it was a hot air balloon, they often leave the downtown point. It was from a distance flat on the bottom sloping to a near point on top. Closer the color was brown and driving nearly beneath it, it was a lighter brown, circular, seamless with three half round equally spaced protursions on the bottom. The rim was lower than the protrusions they could not be seen from any distance. It was stationary about 300 feet above the HJ Heinz food plant. We made a turn at the next light to cross the 32nd Street bridge I turned to look it was gone. He and I saw it but our discription to others were different. His opinion gave it a higher rounder top than mine.I had the best view of the bottom out my window. There were many people on the road the traffic so heavy we could not stop. That evening I listened for a report on TV, there were none.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
observed stationary disk object hovering in clear daylight about 100 feet driving nearly beneath it.;1997-10-30 07:30:00;3 minutes;observed stationary disk object hovering in clear daylight about 100 feet driving nearly beneath it. A coworker and I were on the job in a company truck. We left our plant downtown pittsburgh heading north east across the duquesne bridge on route 8/28 buypass for the 32nd street bridge. I was in the passenger seat and from the duquesne bridge we both saw and object at a distance further up the road. It was flat on the bottom and sloped to a near point on top. Driving closer we could see it was brown  about 100 feet up hovering above the rail tracks between the roadway and the HJ Heinz food plant. We drove almost beneath it. I could see more of it than he out my window. The bottom was a lighter brown seamless with three evenly placed half round protrusions. The rim had a lip which covered the protrusions from a distance.It was about 30-50 feet in diameter. The sky was clear. There was alot of morning rush hour traffic it would have been hard to stop and we never thought of it because by the time we realized what we just saw it was too late. When we turned right on the 32nd street bridge I looked out my window, it was gone. That evening I listened for some report on TV, there was none.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
I saw three black disk shaped UFOs moving at a constant speed during the day and they were at a very low altitude and moving very slow.;2007-02-10 17:00:00;2-3 Minutes;I saw three black disk shaped UFOs moving at a constant speed during the day and they were at a very low altitude and moving very slow. It was bright daylight when I saw three disk shaped craft in the air, against a bright blue sky.  They were black and flying at a very low altitude.  They weren't moving fast, in fact unusually slow for any aircraft, slower than even a bird would normally fly.  One could say they were hovering but moving at a very slow pace.  I was in the library studying for school at the time the sighting occurred.  I just happened to look out the window I was sitting next to, and there they were.  I also saw a light on the object.  I couldn't tell if there was a light on all three of them, but I only saw one light appear at a time.  The light may have been blinking, or I may have only seen it every so often because the object was rotating.  It was hard to tell what exactly happened although these objects were very close to me.  They changed directions like this while all three of them remained in a very tight formation all moving the exactly the same speed.  They did not slow down to move around one another or anything.  What really seemed out of the ordinary was that the objects were extremely close to one another.  At times it was hard to tell if there was more than one of them not saying that they became one at any point, but that is how close they were.  The rotated around one another, perhaps in a circle each one taking turns being the lead craft.  They left my sight however as my view became obstructed by the edge of the building.  I then moved to another window to see them, but I did not see them again.  Also peculiar was that there seemed to be more jets than usual after I saw the objects.  Now I have just moved to the city about six months ago, but I know where the airport is and what it looks like when jets and planes leave for takeoff or come in to land.  I saw three different jets, too far away to tell if they were commercial airliners or fighter jets, but it was very unusual.  Usually when looking into the sky there may be one plane every ten minutes that one could see in the sky from where I was, for there to be three at once was very unusual.  They were flying at seemingly random areas of the sky, not anywhere near where they would be if they were coming in to land or were just leaving the airport.  The jets also seemed to be climbing in altitude at an unusually high pace, for whatever reason, but I do not think that commercial airliners would climb at this high of a rate.  Whether this had anything to do with the objects I saw, I do not know, but I do know that this alone was very unusual.  After I saw this occur, I went out again to see if anything else was out there, but there was no sign of any strange objects.  I then went inside while the jets were still flying above me.  I could not unfortunately get a picture of the objects as the camera I have on my phone is could not take a clear picture of the bright sky.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Bright yellow flying disk, dark center, observed flying over city of Pittsburgh Pa.;2008-05-26 00:00:00;1-1.5 sec;Bright yellow flying disk, dark center, observed flying over city of Pittsburgh, PA. My friend and I were walking through a local park in the city of Pittsburgh close to midnight on Sunday night.  We were heading west towards the park entrance, my friend was ahead of me.  We were going back to where he thought he dropped his cell phone earlier. As I was walking, I was looking up at the sky noticing how nice the stars looked, trying to pick out constellations.  After about a minute of star gazing I observed to what at first to be a bright, yellow in color, meteor streaming across the sky.  But while looking at the object I noticed there was no trail behind, I also saw that within the yellow glow that there was a very distinct disk shaped craft with a darker center (very solid looking).  I only observed it for about one to one and a half seconds max. The object appeared to stop, or rapidly slow down, at one point in midflight, (for a mille second) and continue its flight at the same rate of speed, maybe around 100,000mph.  I observed it flying at an altitude of 400-500 ft., moving silently, no noise at all , traveling in a straight path from the SSE towards the NNW.  I estimated its size to be about 250ft across. In the time I saw the object it appeared to clear about 30-50 miles (within 1-1.5 sec.). Unfortunately neither my friend, who was searching for his phone, nor the bum in the park could confirm my sighting, to my knowledge I am the only person who had seen the object. I am a custodian with the Pittsburgh Public Schools, a very normal person.  What I saw that night left me frozen in shock, I couldn’t move or speak, I even cried a bit (could have been due to my eyes being wide open from the experience). What I saw was real, I don’t know what it was but it was there.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

It was silent and was moving up and down for about a minute and a half and then took off very fast.  My boyfriend and I were jumping on his trampoline, I was facing the backside of him telling him a joke, when I didn't hear any repsonse for a while, I turned to see his face blank looking out at the sky. I than looked in the same direction as him and couldn't believe what we were both witnessing it turned out it was a rotating disk in the sky moving up and down with both red,white, and orange lights flashing at diffrent times.

Shiny silver disk or saucer over Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, then disappeared.;2019-06-28 20:35:00;15 minutes;Shiny silver disk or saucer over Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, then disappeared Pittsburgh, PA. June 28, 2019:  I walked outside in my backyard to take my dog out at around 8:35 PM.  I could sense a storm coming over my way so I looked up into the clouds and noticed a super bright object.  The grey clouds were out in the distance, and the shiny object was right overhead.  It caught my eye at first glance - that’s how shiny it was.  I stared at it for five minutes and realized it could not have been a star nor a plane.  It was located way too high in the sky for it to have been a plane.  I’ve seen both of those things during a sunset and neither of those were what I witnessed. I was watching the object, which looked exactly like a UFO, for 15 minutes straight.  It was a shiny silver color, and it looked horizontally elongated, like a disk.  It did not move. At about 8:50 PM, I saw the shiny object disappear into plain sight.  Again, it didn’t move or anything when I saw it fade away.  It’s like it camouflaged itself right into the color of the sky.  I did not see it after that.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
