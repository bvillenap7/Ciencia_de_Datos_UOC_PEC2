I was looking up at the sky last evening in Pittsburgh PA at 20:23(3/30/00). I was observing the stars when a bright white light(eastern/north eastern sky) caught my attention. The object was larger than a star, circular or semi circular (it happened too quick) and at first I thought it was an aircraft, since it was sitting in the usual airline flight path for landings at Pittsburgh International airport (Planes land from east to west). Then I noticed that the object was not moving. As I tried to focus harder It suddenly and without sound quickly moved straight up into the sky and winked out. I only saw one object and the whole event took place in about a 5 - 10 second period. I was the only witness. I am a 37 year old, college educated(liberal Arts), web designer and part time bartender. This is the oddest thing I have ever seen in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We find this to be a very interesting report.  Not only was the source a seemingly very serious-minded witness, but also, a very peculiar object was seen over Interstate 10, near Casa Grande, AZ, approximately 17 minutes later.  The witness in Arizona is an engineer, a very technically skilled person, and an excellent source of information.  He has been known by the Director of NUFORC for 32 years.  Please see that report, as well.));40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
