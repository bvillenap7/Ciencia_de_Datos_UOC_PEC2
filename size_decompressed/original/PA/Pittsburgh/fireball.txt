When we all;1975-08-01 20:30:00;10-15 min.;We were enjoying the evening sunset, as it glistened off the USX towers downtown Pittsburgh, in a north easterly direction. When we all for some unknown reason looked to our right and witnessed a star dancing in the sky.  It appeared to just dance, back and forth up and down, then it came closer.  Suddenly, it took off in a westerly direction, as we chased it.  Two years later I would witness another event similar in nature in Georgia.  While on bivevac training and standing guard with a Private Rodriguez, I saw a star dancing in the sky, similar to the one I seen, as stated previously.  I related this story to Pvt. Rodriquez and wouldn't you know it.  The star did the exact same thing.  With one exception, I ran to report it to my drill sargent, he thought i was a lunatic.  When I stepped out of his tent some 10 meters away, a stealthy black object appeared above me.  See my second reporting to finish this story. One fireball, starlike. We were Mid teens.  Again, just out to view the sunset.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
bright, relatively large shooting star or meteor	;1999-11-28 20:45:00;1 sec;bright, relatively large shooting star or meteor	 I witnessed the apparent meteor from Liberty Aveenue, facing approximately Northwest, nearly straight ahead on the street, in the Bllomfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA.  The Zip Code of that neighborhood is 15224 (as above).  I was approximately at the intersection of Liberty Ave and Aspen.  The apparent meteor left a long trail, was very bright, was white in color, and flickered like a fireball.  At the end of it's visibility it seemed to flash and disappear.  It made no sound.  I witnessed the object just above and to the right of my dead-ahead horizon point.  I watched the object travel very quickly from upper right to lower left of my field of view, from about 30 degrees to about 10 degrees above the horizon.  (this may be skewed a bit because I was on a city street with lots of 3-6 storey buildings on both sides, and I was driving slightly uphill).  The object seemed very bright and very large and I would say that it is the biggest, brightest, longest-lasting meteor I have ever seen.  I say this because I try to go out to the country and watch meteor showers whenever I know about them, so I have seen lots of meteors.  I'm sure that meteors are sighted all over the world every day, I am really curious if we are in the middle of a meteor shower right now and if anyone else in my part of the country also witnessed this object or other objects.  If you are able to follow up, please let me know.  I'm curious.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

Turnpike) at mile marker 12/13. I witnessed an extremely bright blue almost welding torch like, flash across the sky at an incredible rate of speed. The entire highway and valley area was illuminated like day. This flash was a perfect straight line and then made almost a 45 degree turn banking to the southwest. The flash came directly from the North. At the end of this event the trail was still present and seemed to start to disapate from the south looking almost like a sparkler as it vaporized moving from the South to the North.

Bright orange ball of fire hovers then snapped back up into the atmosphere at a high rate of speed;2008-11-18 21:00:00;5 minutes;Bright orange ball of fire hovers then snapped back up into the atmosphere at a high rate of speed On Tuesday November 18, 2008 I decided to go back to my mothers’ home, the home I grew up in, after I left work at 8:00pm. She resides in Upper St. Clair, PA, a quiet suburb south of Pittsburgh.  I arrived at her home about twenty after eight in the evening. There was a very light snow on the ground. I went to the house, let myself in and found her in the kitchen. After making some coffee and sitting in the kitchen talking for about a half an hour, she went upstairs to change from her work clothes into her pajamas. I went to use the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom faces the front of the house and the road. She lives on a very quiet road with very little traffic, but numerous homes. Behind the house is a very dense wooded area that prohibits any light from coming up the hill from the road below. The road behind the house is about a ¼ mile from our home. I was using the bathroom sitting on the toilet when I heard her go down the stairs. As I was finishing up, I glanced through the venetian blinds as I have a millions times in the past when I was younger. What I saw has occupied all of my time awake and while asleep for the last 24 hours. The shadow of her home was cast on the snow, a perfect silhouette. No car lights would have been able to accomplish this because of how steep the hill and how dense the woods are behind the house, even with sparse leaves on the branches. I yanked up my pants up, zipper down and shirt untucked and bolted down the stairs. My mother was frozen like a statue staring out the back window. What we saw at that point we will remember for the rest of our lives. In the sky only about 10 yards above the tree line, there hovered a perfectly quiet but blazing ball of orange light. I would estimate it to be about 15-20 yards in width. Not oval or cylindrical, but perfectly round. It was very strong and not pulsating or shifting. It was not blinding us at all.  I looked back at the front window, this time from the family room and still saw the house silhouetted on the snow. I continued to stare out the back door that leads that leads to the raised porch as I opened the door. No sound, no heat, no vibration just this spectacular ball of light as I stood on the porch. I ran back in to get a camera down in the game room on the basement level. As I ran to the back door under the porch, the ball became smaller and smaller as it seemed to be yanked back into the sky at an extremely rapid pace. I never got a shot off. I didn’t have time to turn the camera on unfortunately. Today, she asked the next door neighbors, who are an older couple, they saw nothing. Nor did a woman she knows through church who lives on the hillside about 1 mile away from our home, directly behind the house. I believe what we witnessed was not of this world. This was certainly not a noisy helicopter or some child playing a prank. This was a real, tangible, perfectly silent ball of orange fire well above the tree line. If anyone in this area had a similar encounter from the evening of 11/18/08 I would be highly interested in hearing your account of that evening. Can anyone help us understand this?;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
glowing fireball seen in the sky over Pittsburgh, PA;2010-10-31 19:00:00;1 minute;glowing fireball seen in the sky over Pittsburgh, PA I was sitting on my front porch steps handing out candy when my boyfriend said what is that in the sky. We both wintnessed a bright orange ball of light that appeared to be glowing. I cannot estimate the distance but it was close. We live close to the PGH International Airport and I have seen commerical aircraft flying at a higher altitude. This object was stationary and made no sound. We watched it for approximately one minute and the object just disappeared. It is a clear night and there were no clouds in the sky at the time.

Saw Fireballs in the sky last night.  Same as many other UFO video and sightings.  Have pictures.;2013-10-27 22:15:00;1-2 minutes;Saw &quotFireballs&quot in the sky last night.  Same as many other UFO video and sightings. Have pictures. At approx. 9:15 P.M., I was on the phone with my mother and from behind the tall oak trees, I saw 3 very large fire ball looking objects in the sky.  They were flying relatively low, juxtaposed to the typical air traffic I see here. The balls were in a V formation, but were floating and flying at the same time... kind of swerving back and forth, but staying in somewhat of a V formation.  I could barely tell my mother I'd call her back.  Tried to hang up and get my phone camera set up. By the time I focused and clicked, all but one was gone.  Unfortunately, my camera picked up a dot.  They just went out.  They didn't fly away.  The sky was very clear and they definitely did not fly away.  They just disappeared. Called mom back in a freaked out state and was on the phone with her...  Maybe 3-5 minutes and saw another one coming from the same direction.  This time I didn't take time to say goodbye.  Got the phone working and when I aimed to take the picture, there were 4 lights on my screen and only 1 in the sky.  I kept snapping pictures, despite my disbelief. There were 4 on the screen and 1 in the sky. It too, just disappeared. All of them would sort of blink out.  Again, unfortunately my phone camera stinks, but I did get the fireball and when I expand the photos, the lights look round but the more they expand, they look almost like crescent moons, a fuzzy backwards C.   Upon further inspection, I realized that the 2 lights on the bottom of the screen, were house lights.  You can distinguish the other two, as they are much higher in the sky and have the exact same crescent shape upon expanding the photo.  I do not know if the second one appeared whilst I was focused on the other one. I searched and found a video of another sighting here in Pittsburgh from this past Aug. 2013. found on YouTube.  It's exactly what I saw.  Also found many videos from around the globe, with the exact thing I saw. I did not report it for fear of looking nuts and no one else (apparently) saw them or reported seeing anything.  I am a stay at home mother of 5 children and am the fourth generation on my mother's side, to live in our old farm house located on the outskirts of the City of Pittsburgh.  We have lots of land here, despite still being in the city. I know that what I saw was not normal.  We have regular air traffic flying overhead, as the airport is relatively close by.  I saw airplanes, shortly after these sightings.  These were not airplanes.  When I saw the exact same things, littered all over UFO sighting websites and YouTube, my heart sank further.  This scared me enough to be up all night researching and to now be reporting this. For some reason, I can't check the information below.  I would definitely like to be contacted.  I also have a story about my sister and I when we were kids.  Hesitant to share it online.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

They moved slowly, then entered a triangular formation.  After entering a triangular formation, two of the crafts elevated and disappeared one at a time slowly.  Over the course of 30 seconds, like winking out, but did not move.  The third remained. A fourth aircraft approached over the horizon moving quickly and left a reddish orange trail that dissappated quickly over approx 2 seconds.  It then hovered in approximately the center of the original triangle.  This craft hovered for approximately 2 minutes before it too winked out.  The forth craft appeared more red/orange.  The first group was all white.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

No sounds were made.

Noticed a bright orange light moving slowly west.  I would guess low altitude, a few thousand feet at most.  Absolutely no sound.  It appeared to radiate light strings (like the center of those plasma ball lamps) I ran outside to film it with my phone, but as you'd expect the quality is terrible as I couldn't get focus as close as I'd like to with an iphone. The object turned north fairly sharply, traveled a quarter mile or so and then accelerated northwest and out of sight. This object did not seem to be reflecting sunset, it seemed to be creating its own source of light.  This object was too quiet for a known (to me) engine powered craft at that altitude.   This object also was fairly nimble at maneuvering.  I would not consider its motion to be high speed (when viewed).;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

Trans-morphic scintillating orb/fireball south by southeast of Pittsburgh PA about 30 degrees off of the horizon.;2020-10-17 19:46:00;interval still present;Trans-morphic scintillating orb/fireball south by southeast of Pittsburgh PA about 30 degrees off of the horizon. I'm a military veteran and have seen numerous aircraft, obviously. I do not have ANY interest in UFO sightings, or any possible nonsense that gets people caught up in this stuff, which I think is ridiculous. I was bringing groceries in my house and I noticed an orb with scintillating red lights. Thinking it was a satellite, I dismissed it. But this would flicker in an oscillating pattern which is uncommon for a satellite - thus piquing my interest. I have a 40 x 60 spotting scope, and when under max view, an image of a nebulous orb-like, trans-morphic disc came into view that would look, for a lack of a better description, something extra-dimensional as the red to reddish orange luminescence of it was entering and exiting this dimensional simultaneously - very difficult to describe - not necessarily emitting objects, but more of a hue that changes color - almost as if watching a photonic effect waivering from a movie projector against a wall, only many miles! away in the sky, obviously. The object is stationary and is not trailing anywhere. I apologize if this is a poor rendering of what it exhibited, but that would be the best way that I can codify it into words, as it is nothing like I have ever seen before. I’m sure it is probably some new classified technology before it is really some alien craft lol – but nonetheless, I thought it would be worthwhile to document this as something in the future we can possibly look back on to either confirm nor deny the existence of said object, or said technology.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
