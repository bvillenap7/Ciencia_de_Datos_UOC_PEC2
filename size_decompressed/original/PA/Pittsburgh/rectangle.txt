At first glance it seemed like an airplane but the more I looked at it, the more I kept thinking that it was something else. The object was EXTREMELY high in altitude and was moving at a great rate of speed.  Much different then an airplane would move in the sky, and much higher then I had even seen any aircraft.  There was no noise, no jet sounds, no sonic booms, just this object traveling in a straight line.  It had 3 colored lights, red white and green.  These lights from left to right would alternate flashes.  They were appx 2 seconds between each flash.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Craft zoomed past my windshield.;2012-10-12 06:30:00;3 seconds;Craft zoomed past my windshield Me and my roommate at the time were leaving a friends house in my truck .  I left and made a left was coming down a hill.  There was a low flying object.  Rectangle shaped maybe tradition UFO disc with 4 huge lights not consistent with a aircraft I see planes all the time.  This object was not over head but visible thru the windshield moved from r to l across the windshield in view maybe half way cutting aross the window.   I looked at him and said you see that??  He said ya I seen it.  I said was it a plane?  He said idk what it was.  And won't answer to this day what it was.  There was from left to right square white light rectangle red light small space red rectangle white square.  This was NO blinking light that all air planes have.   We live between 2 airports but this thing was silent and zoomed across too fast.  And was gone!!!!  By the time I hit the corner. I obviously don't belive in god literally but I assure you this is 100% true story. I also have a video of a light orb on my security cameras for 8 Minutes  I don't know what it was but I have seen stink bugs spiders u name the bug I seen it on there this is something else.  The cat even watches it.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Rectangular object gray in color moving slowly from east to west in the NW sky.;2020-11-01 07:40:00;45 seconds;Rectangular object gray in color moving slowly from east to west in the NW sky. While coming home from shopping I observed a rectangular object in the northwest sky that looked like and advertising banner that's pulled behind a plane only there was no plane.  The object remained stationary horizontally about 500 to 1000 ft in altitude but moved slowly from east to west while sighted.  As I glanced away for a second or two to pull up to my house to take a photo it disappeared from sight.  The sky was cloudy and it's possible it may have entered one.  I stayed a short while longer before unloading my car to see if it would reappear, but it didn't.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
