Two glowing disks seen over an Interstate highway in Western Pennsylvania.;1980-01-15 22:00:00;15 min.;Two glowing disks seen over an Interstate highway in Western Pennsylvania. I was on my way home from a job interview (1980s approx.).  It was late at night, about 10pm or so. I was on I-79 (I think that is the name of the Interstate).   Suddenly, I saw two glowing disks floating over the mediam strip. I couldn't tell exactly how big they were, but they were huge and hovering just a few feet above some pine trees: approximzte altitude-40 to 50 feet.  I did not see any details, just their glowthey never moved. I was driving south at about 60mph and the sky was overcast.  In about 15 minutes I was past them and nothing else happened.  I checked my watch and did not notice any missing time.  It was a bitter cold night in January or February I do not remember exactly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

At first I thought it was a plane that may have had a engine on fire.  I ran outside with my husband and there was NO sound.   I live in the suburbs, so it is quite at this time of night.  No blinking lights like a plane would have.   All I could see is a red and orange flame like light. It seemed to flicker like a fire would.  But I could not see any vehicle.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

It was in a stationary position in the sky and oval shaped bright white light in the center, small reddish lights at the bottom surrounded by a transparent sheer light with a definite oval shape.   It disappeared so I drove to the bottom of the hill and saw it again but in a different position.  There was a plane flying low and another higher up  I circled back up the hill and we spotted it again but in a different position to the extreme left of the original sighting again stationary in the sky.   We snapped a picture with our phone. The first sighting appeared as a bright white light in the center with a sheer haze around it. The last sighting the haze appeared to have changed color slightly and looked slightly blue I wasn't sure if I didn't notice the color the first time or not.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

My friend and I were waiting outside and we see an oval type object that was metallic and was shining bright reflecting the sun as it set.  It came from the horizon and floated/flew behind a set of tree’s slowly and we couldn’t see it after that.  There was no clouds that day and we’re 100% sure it was not a plane, blimp, or helicopter.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

I looked and noticed the objects were gaining height and glowing orange.  Next thing, the one object drops out of sight while the other gained height and vanished.  A couple minutes later two more objects appear doing the same thing and then vanish.  Incident lasted about 12 minutes, including one more object appearing.   Thought it might be Chinese lanterns but watched videos of them and they didn't glow or perform the mannerisms of these objects.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

It changed colors going from red to green to bright white and was blinking widely and appeared to not move despite going from one spot to another in the sky in the blink of an eye. It would also appear to jerk around the sky at points and was totally silent. We also observed a regular plane divert its course and drop low practically hugging the tops of the homes to avoid what ever this was. It had a clear oval shape to it every time it blinked and we both were able to capture videos of it and on video you could see just how fast this thing really was.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
