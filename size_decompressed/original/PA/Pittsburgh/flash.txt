Supermassive flash of light over Pittsburgh area.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-10 23:15:00;5-10 minutes;Supermassive flash of light over Pittsburgh area. I was driving home when the sky in front of me lit up bright orange and red.  It look as though someone had set an ICBM off right above the city of Pittsburgh.  It lasted for about 10 minutes, and it lingered as a massive explosion would, I am a vet so as soon as I saw it I braced for the boom, but there was never a peep.
