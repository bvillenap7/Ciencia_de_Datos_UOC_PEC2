sphere sighted at top of the triangle resturant in pittsburgh, pa...;1993-06-01 14:00:00;15 sec;sphere sighted at top of the triangle resturant in pittsburgh, pa... we(my wife and i)were having lunch/dinner at the top of the triangle restaurant atop the steel building in pittsburgh pa. it was a clear, sunny afternoon and we were sitting by the window enjoying the view. we were talking and my wife (looking out the window) says what is that. i turned around and about 20 feet outside the window behind me there was a small sphere about the size of a soccer ball just hovering level with our floor. it was flat white in color. at first i thought some little kid lost a balloon, but it wasn't asending as a balloon would have been. anyway, my wife says again,,,what is that. just then it starts moving slowly right past our window, makes a 90 degree turn and flys away on a level course until it was out of sight. i tell my wife, i don't know what that was, but if someone was inside that thing they were only three inches tall!!  ha ha.  about 10 seconds after this thing was out of sight, a civilian type hellicopter flew swiftly by the building heading in the same direction as the ufo. another thing that i found strange was that the room was full of people and it didn't look like anybody else saw it. how could that be!!!  note the date that this occured is a guess. all i know is that this happened before 1995. in 1995 we started having kids and the only resturants we went to until lately were mcdonalds , chuck e cheeses ect....;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
3 UFOs sighted over a nighborhood, moving in strange, irregular patterns.;2008-06-06 19:43:00;15 mins;3 UFOs sighted over a nighborhood, moving in strange, irregular patterns. Witness 1- I saw a planet or sphere shaped object. It was glowing red white, then blinked white twice again. It was also moving in an odd pattern as if it was having engine problems and started to shake.  Witness 2- I encountered or sighted 2 strange objects moving across the sky. The first object was shaped like an old fashioned UFO seen in movies. It was glowing green and white. It moved very strangely. It seemed to be spinning at about 60 mph and moved up and down in an irregular wave-like pattern. The second UFO I sighted was glowing white and was shaped as if a bulging pan. It also appeared out of thin air with a dim flash and shot like a bullet. It disappeared fast and also disappeared with a flash, but, this time the flash was brighter.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

Deep-Orange Pulsating Object flying slowly over a suburb of Pittsburgh;2009-07-12 21:55:00;2-3 Minutes;Deep-Orange Pulsating Object flying slowly over a suburb of Pittsburgh We were approaching the cemetery, taking the back road to a friend's house and I looked to the sky and saw what looked like a low-flying plane at first. The light coming off was a solid deep-orange, but also pulsated. The object was coming in our direction maintaining its height, and stopped almost seemingly noticing it was being watched. The objects color disappeared and a solid black sphere could be seen. The sphere moved back and forth a bit, slowly, and began to faintly light orange. Then the object stayed the black color, and traveled the opposite direction from which it came, seemingly flying lower as it traveled off. I also tried to take a video of the object but my cell phone would not pick it up!;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Red/Orange globe with flame tail moving across sky, stopping then reversing direction.;2010-10-22 21:22:00;2 minutes;Red/Orange globe with flame tail moving across sky, stopping then reversing direction. I observed an orange globe or light very high in the sky with an orange tail of the same color.  My initial thought was it was a comet or meteor because it was bright and had a flame trailing it.  At first it appeared to get closer and was moving horizontally at a slight downward angle then it appeared to just stop with the flame like tail diminishing as it did.  Then it began to move completely horizontal across the sky in the opposite direction it was initially traveling.  There was a group of people standing there and I wanted to stop to ask if “do you see this?” but they were in the middle of an argument.  I called my friend co-worker on the phone, somebody to try to correlate what I was seeing but by the time I completed the call the orange globe slowly started ascending into the twilight sky and disappeared.   I was driving and pulled off the road to watch the object.  Total time observed was about 2 minutes.  The time was exactly 9:24 PM by my cell ph! one history on Friday October 22.  Friday night was a clear crisp cloudless evening. I am a Chief in a branch of Public Safety for the City of Pittsburgh and have never and would never report something like this if I was not absolutely certain that what I saw could be explained away as a manmade object or a natural celestial occurrence.  I called the local TV station (WPXI in Pittsburgh) to ask if they had any reports of anything strange in the sky.  The person who answered sounded as if I was annoying him so I cut the conversation short leaving no other information.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Observed 2-3 bright orange orbs just east of Downtown Pittsburgh;2011-06-19 21:45:00;3 minutes;Observed 2-3 bright orange orbs just east of Downtown Pittsburgh Driving home from a family gathering, I spotted two orange orbs in sky above the Regent Square neighborhood of Pittsburgh—east of Downtown.   I told my husband to pull the car over, and we both watched the two orbs hover above each meandering, moving slightly, but not in any particular direction.  They were both the same fire orange color and seemed to be very high above.   We watched both of these orbs for about two minutes.  Then, one disappeared.  We watched the second one for about 45 seconds, and then it too seemed to disappear before our eyes.   We pulled back on to the road to continue our drive home, and within the next minute I spotted what was possibly a third orb, or perhaps one of the two that saw previously, appear in a different part of the sky.   Just as we were about to pull over to watch the orange orb, it was gone too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Identified (sic. Unidentified??) small sphere next to jet airliner while flying near Pittsburgh.;2016-05-31 18:00:00;2 seconds;Identified (sic. Unidentified??) small sphere next to jet airliner while flying near Pittsburgh. I was flying in a plane was descending to Pittsburgh Airport and was looking out the window.  I was looking forward out the window and saw a sphere approaching the plane going the opposite direction, moving fast, since we were going in the direct opposite. My first thought was, what is that up here, then it was abreast of the wing, then gone. I had a good look as it was close to the plane.  Round looking slightly reddish with one antenna sticking out that I could see and appeared to have others wrapped around the sphere.  It was not smooth in that sense. The whole event was a second or so but caught my attention.  I didn't say anything to the crew, as I departed, though I wanted to ask.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

This report is just a collective of UFO’s I have seen in the past 2 years on top of this instance. I shall start with this instance. I;2017-09-20 01:00:00;3-4 hours;This report is just a collective of UFO’s I have seen in the past 2 years on top of this instance. I shall start with this instance.  I am a kind of guy that when he sees something unexplainable like this, he just considers it unknown yet strange.  I have a balcony to which I go out to smoke.  Being as how I live in the city it is very rare to see stars.  So when I recognize something that reminds me of a star I stare at it (I love stars.)  Every time I see an unidentified glowing object or “flying object I stare at them to make sure I’m not crazy and or to validate the realness.  I went out to smoke and I noticed the “star” I was looking at was indeed not a star.  And it was seemingly moving against the laws of physics. As if it could go through time or something.  As I noticed that one I had noticed 2 others doing the same thing.  These bluish glowing orbs were moving short distances at breakneck speeds.  I have noticed these same phenomena in the past.  Even having intelligent adults look in wonderment.  That is all that happened in this instance.  The other must tell story is about a year ago during the late summer to fall months.  I had just got to my girlfriends mothers house (I lived there) and on the horizon my girlfriend, her mother, and I had witnessed a giant (10 times bigger than the moon perceptually) orange sphere.  It was almost exactly like the depictions of USO’s.  Except there was no large body of water anywhere near me.  My girlfriends mother just shrugged it off while I was so lost and curious.  There is constant sightings of UFO’s in my area.  We even had a woman In Pittsburgh last august make it on the news for seeing something strange  In the sky.  She calls the police and even the police think its weird.  Wish we could know what the phenomena is or is caused by.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
