It was in Plum Boro Pennsylvania. Not really a ufo hot spot. I hovered there until we left after 15 minutes It was just after Christmas of 1986. The craft was hovering over a local tavern called Nashville North. I was not drunk. I was to young to drink. But, the night was very cool and clear. My mother and I were driving down the Road and up we looked and saw the craft. It was a very silent night. The kind were if your car windows are open you can hear the tires crunch the snow very clear. There was a very lite snow. But, not enough to inhibit your vision. you could actually hear the snow land it was that clear out. We stopped the car and watched the craft for about 15 minutes as it hung motionless. The only think that seemed to move were the lights that out lined the craft. It was triangular in shape. It appeared to be about 300 feet in the air.It could have been 200 feet long. I can't really judge it that well because I didn't have anything to compare it to. I will never forget that night for as long as I live. I do believe it to be an alien craft. A ufo. Or what ever you would like to call it. I have know reason to make this up. I'm not a big Sci-fi freak. Or a Star Wars fan. I just know what I saw. I really don't talk about it because you always get the same response of.... oohhhhh space men are coming. ET phone home and all of the other things I'm sure that you can think of.

Enormous black triangle, southeast of Pittsburgh, 1987/88.;1988-06-30 03:00:00;not sure;Enormous black triangle, southeast of Pittsburgh, 1987/88. Hello.  I have shared this story with a very few individuals, close friends who can be trusted.  I have also, more recently, shared it online, in emails to a few individuals, in hopes of getting some kind of (hopefully positive) feedback, possibly opening a dialogue with someone who has had a similar experience, but as yet to date, feedback has been minimal, and no dialogue.  I am certain there are others who have had similar experiences, but don’t know how to go about finding them.  At any rate, here goes:   Back in about 1987 or 1988, I was staying at a friend’s house.  I was doing some work on their farm, southeast of Pittsburgh, PA.  I was sleeping on the couch, when I had a dream that was not a dream.  Let me elaborate:  I was startled awake somehow, and had the instantaneous impulse to get up and run outside, onto the porch.  When I did, I saw an enormous black triangle hovering above, and slightly to the right (South) of the house.  There were no discernible lights, as I recall, but there seemed to be dome-like shapes along the bottom of the thing.  (craft? Ship?)  I don’t know how long I stared at it, but I became aware that it appeared to be sucking up trees from the ground and levitating them up into it somehow.  I started crying. Suddenly there was a blonde female there with me, about 5’ 4 tall, straight blonde hair, like in the Swedish Bikini Team commercials, dressed in either black or dark blue close fitting flight suit type uniform.  I don’t recall any kind of emblems or markings on the uniform.  { I will note here that at that time I had not heard of the Billy Meier case.  I have only learned of it recently.}  I did not, far as I remember, actually see her descend from the vehicle, she was just kind of suddenly there on the porch with me.  I immediately felt reassurance, and an overwhelming sense of peace and calm.  She told me that everything would be alright, that they were going to put the trees back when they were done, that everything would be as it had been before, and that there would be no sign that anything had happened.  I looked into her eyes, (deep blue or maybe green, like a lake) and I instantly felt as though we had known each other for a very long time, maybe forever.  I knew her name then, though I don’t know it now.  She put her hand on my shoulder, and, Bam.  I was waking up on the couch again, startled.   I got up and ran outside, fully expecting to see a black triangle, but there was nothing in the sky except stars.  I stood there dumbfounded, thinking it must’ve been a dream, but it was no dream.  I know it wasn’t. I don’t know if she wiped my memory, and maybe it didn’t fully erase, (?) or if maybe I was allowed to remember only certain parts of the experience, or if I was supposed to believe that it was “just a dream.  I really wish that she would return again, the connection I felt was so profoundly deep. I will add that the area where the farm was is not far from a high-security government installation, the US Bureau Of Mines, which I don’t believe for a minute is actually a coal mine.  They have 12’, double-row, barbed wire fences surrounding the place, which were in place as long ago as the early 1980s, long before the heightened state of security in the post 9/11 era.  I had a friend who used to work there as a janitor.  A few of us decided to go and see him one day, there was a sliding gate which was open, and on a whim we just decided to drive in and see if we could find him.  Within about a minute, we were being closely followed by a dark blue Chevy Caprice Classic.  We kept on driving.  Then a white Chevy Caprice Classic pulled out in front of us, cutting us off.  Three men wearing black suits, black ties, and black sunglasses approached the car, and demanded identification.  One of them said, “State your business here.”  We told them we were looking for our friend.! He said, “This is a restricted area.  You have no business here.  Turn your vehicle around and leave immediately.”  Needless to say, we were scared shitless.  We were teenagers out for a ride on an otherwise uneventful day.  We turned around, with the blue car now in front of us, and the white car following us closely.  They followed us like that after we got back on the main road, for about a mile or so.  It was very weird.  Were they the infamous “men in black?” And, if so, why were they there?  Why would they need such a high level of security at a “coal mine” anyway?  I knew from then on that there was something not right about that place, it gave me the creeps, and I always tried to avoid it if possible. This incident took place earlier than the other one, approximately 1985 or so.  There have been other strange occurrences throughout my life, but these two stand out in my memory. My ex wife, some friends, and I were laying on a trampoline in a yard, stargazing.  We all remarked about this bright red dot, wondering if it was Mars, or what, when all of a sudden, it just shot off to the north northeast, zip!  We all said “Whoa, what the hell was that?!”  This was just after the time of the Hale-Bopp Comet. I have more, but I will wait for a reply on this first.  Namaste. My ethnicity is Native American/Celtic/Anglo-Saxon. My religion is Pagan, though I was raised Methodist. I am currently in my mid forties, at the time of the first incident listed, I was in my twenties, at the time of the second incident I was a teenager, at the time of the third incident I was around thirty. The memory of the first incident, though incomplete, is extremely vivid. I have strange, Post Apocalyptic dreams sometimes. I have a strong fear of Greys, the pictures people draw give me the willies, yet I have no memory of ever seeing one up close. I don't know if I believe Billy Meier or not. I don't know if I really believe everything that Bill Cooper wrote in Pale Horse, but a lot of it makes sense.  I know the US government lies.  They cannot be trusted. I know that something is going to happen on 21, December of this year, 2012, I just don’t know exactly what. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Black triangle shaped disc appeared out of nowhere and was dark except for four attached lights,scary.;1993-03-06 19:00:00;30minutes;Black triangle shaped disc appeared out of nowhere and was dark except for four attached lights,scary. Was going shopping and it was supposed to be a lunar eclipse. I wanted to get pictures of it. After I took pictures I noticed this triangular shaped craft hovering beside me. It made no noise at all. Wherever I drove it followed me and my wife. I tried getting a picture and it sped off. My photos did not take of the eclipse or the craft. All pictures were black. I used a flash, so it should have taken. The craft was triangular with a light at the point and three consecutive lights at the base. I have been listening to am coast to coast and have found I am not the only one to see this type of object. Any response would be appreciated. Thank you.

(the following night at the same time, we noted the sky was very active with various jets and planes overhead every 30-seconds).  because it was a black object against the black sky, the height is definitely a guestimate.  but the object was most definitely a large black triange.  two of us saw it.  after it passed, I asked my friend to give a specific description of what he had seen so I could validate what I had seen.  We both went inside and individually drew a picture of what we'd seen.  We drew the exact same object.  My friend noticed a light on the bottom that I did not notice.  You ask for a brief description of us: we are college educated, in our 40s, neither had ever seen such a thing, I am in TV, he is a musician.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

Object was lit by moonlight or would not have been noticed. Saw arrowhead shaped object, with no light, pass very near the area of sky with the moon.  It took about 2 seconds to cover the distance of the diameter of the moon.  The object was moving approximately from west to east.  There were no clouds in the sky at the time. Object was lit by moonlight or would probably have not have been noticed. I would have thought it was a cloud by the general coloring and appearance if it were not for the fact that it was extremely symetrical, it did not change shape or fade, and there were no other clouds present in the sky.  The size of the image was about 3/4 of the size of the image of the moon in the sky.  I'm just curious if anyone else saw something that night in the Pittsburgh sky.  A few seconds after witnessing the event I did hear what sounded like a loud jet, but I live in an urban area with a great many noise heard from multiple sources.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

Red-orange triangular object with large flames flying during fireworks display;2013-07-04 21:45:00;5 minutes;Red-orange triangular object with large flames flying during fireworks display While watching fireworks, I saw a large red/orange plane-shape (triangular) in another part of the sky, with orange flames coming out of the bottom. At first I thought it might be part of  the fireworks, but it was steadily flying in the opposite direction of the fireworks.  I thought it odd that it was so vibrantly colored and that it would be flying so close to a major fireworks display.  I tried to photograph it, but by the time I got my camera, it was too far away to properly capture it.  However, when I first spotted it, it seemed fairly close to the ground.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

TR-3B Astra?  ((anonymous report));2017-10-22 23:00:00;10 minutes;TR-3B Astra? I was alerted to the presence of a low altitude helicopter.  I opened my window and looked up to see a helicopter at about 600ft. altitude flying directly below and behind a large triangle object at about 1500ft. altitude.  The helicopter and triangle object were traveling Eastward.  The helicopter was lit underneath and appeared to be military, possibly UH-1N.  The triangle object was very slow moving at about 50 knots.  The triangle made no perceptible sound.  The triangle had large, round, diffuse white lights on each corner, a large faint yellowish/orange light in the center, and a small strobing red light off center to the rear of the craft.  I estimate the size of the triangle to be about 300ft. from corner to corner.  The helicopter broke course and headed Westward at low altitude along the Allegheny river then down the Ohio river while the triangle continued slowly Eastward until out of view.

Two lights, one white, one blinking red, travelling at the same speed  showed as its profle a triangular UFO-lights etched shape of it;2019-10-09 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Two lights, one white, one blinking red, travelling at the same speed  showed as its profle a triangular UFO-lights etched shape of it On the night of October 9th 2019 at 21:00 EST, I witnessed a UFO at the Northland Public Library (300 Cumberland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15237).  The sky was clear and the moon was out (past full moon stage). I have frequented this library day and evening for the past 20 years and I’m familiar with the typical lights present at night. As I was walking to my car from the closed library, I noticed two lights at about 45° approaching from the Eastward direction travelling Westward.  The lights were separated a little less than 3°  the top light was white while the bottom one was a red blinking light.  I wondered if they were stationary or moving so I got into my car and used the oil change reminder sticker on my inside windshield to measure yes they were moving slowly and moving in together at the same speed. I got out of the car to observe and try to take a picture/video. After a minute, this slowly travelling object showed its profile to me it was a triangular! -shaped UFO with lights (portal lights?) highlighting the whole shape of the UFO a total of about 1° width. The edges were not sharp, they were curved. After it passed, I hurried and drove to an adjacent church where I could get a better view. From this vantage point, I saw it calmly proceed in the Westward direction toward the horizon.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
