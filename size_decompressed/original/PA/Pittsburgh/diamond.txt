UFO at a Steelers game.;2001-10-21 14:00:00;a minute;UFO at a Steelers game. I remember watching a Steelers football game and the camera focused on a diamond shaped object.  The announcers didn't know what it was.  Anyway I stumbled onto this site when I did a search on this and I see that someone else reported it as well.  What I remember about the details is different than him.  He may be more accurate than me.  It was a long time ago.  We both agree that it wa a Steelers game though.  His is dated 10-21-01 or close to it.  Just thought I would add this because I did see the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
