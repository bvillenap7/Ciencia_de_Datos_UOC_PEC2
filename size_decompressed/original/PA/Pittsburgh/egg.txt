All of the sudden this almost elipsical object came within a fifty feet of us, and it was right above us.  it barly made any sound then all of the sudden it made this rumbling sound.  it followed us for about five minutes the two others came. one from our left and one from our back.  we keep running hoping that they would go away, but they kept following us.  when we came near the end of our trip by some houses we looked back up to see them start moving to were we first saw them, then with a flash of light they flew up into the sky.
