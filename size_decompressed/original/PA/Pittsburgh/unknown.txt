I am guessing at the month and day. Sometime in fall. Observed a star in sky brighter that others as I entered driveway.  I have a clear view of the sky.  Stopped and onserved.  I seemed to get bigger and smaller, but not a lot.  Then it got bright, shrunk down to a normal size star, the then shot off horizontally at an incredible speed, slowed down, the turned at a righ angle and shot up vertically into the clouds as fast as could be. Natural things don't move this way.  Window was down. It wasn't glare on glass etc. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may be describing the dramatic sighting that occurred over Ontario, Lake Erie, and western Pennsylvania on Friday morning, 0040 hrs., August 25, 1995.  However, that is a guess.  We would like to correspond with the witness to confirm the date, but he provides no contact information.  We would like to have the individual contact our Center.  We have amended the date here.  PD));40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

Power went out and bright red and blue lights lit up the sky. Later, green lights flashed;2010-02-05 23:00:00;on and off for 5 hours;Power went out and bright red and blue lights lit up the sky. Later, green lights flashed The power in the neighborhood wenton and off from 10pm- 4am. Since there is almost 2 ft of snow on the ground, it was still bright out.  A bright red and blue flash startled me when I was looking out the window (I thought it was police car) but since it is a state of emergency, no cars were allowed on the road. About 20 min later, a bright yellow flash shined in my room.  About an hour after that, a bright green flash seemed to light up our whole neighborhood. Right before each of these light anomalies, there was a sort of a revving of an engine sound and then the power would cut out.  We have all under the ground power lines as well as no light posts in our neighborhood.  When looking out our back window, a yellow light seemed to fly past us on 3 separate occasions;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
On Decemeber 4th,2010 at 8 P.M in Pittsburgh, Pa, 14 unknown silent aircrafts flew over head and vanished.;2010-12-04 20:00:00;1 hour;On Decemeber 4th,2010 at 8 P.M in Pittsburgh, Pa, 14 unknown silent aircrafts flew over head and vanished. Myself and 4 witnesses were outside viewing an unknown aircraft that had no noise and only a visible red fire ball type effect. 14 consecutive air crafts would fly solo in about 5 minute increments and head to the same direction and vanish. They could not have been airplanes, helicopters, or even stealth jets. They were more discreet and two of them came very close to each other in a controlled and slowed motion, then parted ways because the other 12 begin to come into the picture. I am not a huge believer in ufo's etc, but this one was my first and am curious to know what it was or if there was any planned Auto Drone experiment going on or what not. Hope this helps!;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Orange Glowing Objects Over Pittsburgh;2011-10-22 21:45:00;10 minutes;Orange Glowing Objects Over Pittsburgh My boyfriend and I were driving home through Etna on Little Pine Creek Road, and saw at first about six of them as we were coming around the bend of the road.  They were orange glowing objects all in same general area, almost in a line, moving across the sky.  We both had never seen anything like this in all our life.  We traveled to the top of the hill on Marzolf Road to get a better view.  There ended up being about 10 of them, maybe more.  They were all moving in the same direction (S-SE), coming from the same direction(N-NW), moving very quickly, making no noise.  There were no blinking lights on them. We attempted to get video on our cellphone, but of course, cellphones don't make the best cameras for night video recordings or nighttime pictures.  It was a very interesting sight.  I am sure there is an explanation for the sightings.  I don't know if maybe they were weather balloons, perhaps.  I'll probably hear of it on the news sometime soon.  I'm sure! we weren't the only ones who saw these unusual objects.  Never saw anything like it, so I thought I should report it.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Five high-flying objects in a row with bright red lights over Pittsburgh.;2012-01-01 12:15:00;5 minutes;Five high-flying objects in a row with bright red lights over Pittsburgh. Five high-flying objects, pulsing slowly from white to bright red, flew in a straight line from east to west over the western suburbs of Pittsburgh. They were too high to be headed to the airport, and it was too late (after midnight) for airport traffic or any kind of landing pattern. What made it eye-catching was the bright powerful red pulsing light on each, and the pattern, flying maybe a couple miles apart from each other in a straight line, that high up.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Saw what I believe to be some kind of a comet or craft;2012-09-10 02:00:00;a couple of seconds;Saw what I believe to be some kind of a comet or craft I couldn't sleep so I awoke and was looking up at the stars like I always do when I saw some kind of a craft go shooting through the sky.  Since I live close to an airport and I see airplanes all the time I knew it wasn't an airplane because it made no noise and it moved too fast.  Also it made absolutely no noise so I took out my cell phone camera because I was going to video it if I saw it again but it didn't.  This may be nothing but the way it moved looked like it had some destination.  My dad was an airforce pilot in the Canadian armed forces and when we were camping in Italy many years ago my mother told me he and she were sitting outside enjoying the night when they saw an actual ufo either crash or land and since my dad is a pilot he knew about airplanes.  Keep in mind this was maybe 40 years ago so I have always believed in them.   Anyway I would like to know if anyone else saw what I saw. I know what I saw was real!;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Recurring sightings of 3 UFOs.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible stars??  PD));2012-11-16 21:00:00;60 minutes;Recurring sightings of 3 UFOs Three objects seen from southside of pittsburgh.  One object appeared to be a bright white light that seemed to dim when planes flew in close proximity, and had two other unidentifiable objects on either side of it.  The two other objects appeared to hover, then move in a quick zig zag pattern.  These two objects appeared to have red, blue and green lights that appeared to pulsate.  Definitely was not a helicopter, commercial airliner or satellite.  Viewed these objects for approximately one hour.  These objects have been noticed by several neighborhood folks, and nobody has a logical explanation for these occurrences.

I was driving with my wife and baby in the backseat when I noticed 3 amber lights moving slowly across the night sky.  I pointed them out to my wife.  They were not as bright as aircraft lights, but still clearly visible.  The lights seemed to be moving at the same speed and in the same direction.  I couldn't estimate how high up they were or how large they were.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Driving across the Glenfied Bridge, northbound, saw an odd shape as i was looking southeast down the Ohio.;2013-10-01 12:30:00;1 minute;Driving across the Glenfied Bridge, northbound, saw an odd shape as i was looking southeast down the Ohio. It wasn't a plane.  It was low on the horizon.  No blimp either.  It wasn't on any approach to Greater Pitt International. It was in controlled flight about seven miles off.  I judge the distance from how far I can see down the river. I was going to play (bad) golf at Olde Stonewall.  1:22 tee time.  I never mentioned this to anyone, till now. Maybe someone else saw it. Too big for blimp or airplane or Kc135s or even a C5 or C17.  Much less a Hercules.  We get those types around here.  National guard base and refueling and airlift wing. And this was at least one week after a big mobilization by the guard. Don't take my word for it, hope you find other reports to verify mine.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Saw 2 bright glowing orbs in Pittsburgh.;2016-11-06 18:45:00;15 minutes;Saw 2 bright glowing orbs in Pittsburgh. I was watching the walking dead when i glanced out the window and noticed 2 bright glowing objects in the sky.  At first i thought they were stars but I looked back I noticed they were slowly moving one directly up and the other slowly to the east.  I live in the path to the airport so I thought maybe they were planes in the distance, but they had red lights on them, they were simply bright light, I went out and watched them for 15 as they slowly kept moving, I noticed one start to get brighter and glow with a green hue i went back in to get my phone to try and get a picture but my camera sucks at night so I didnt bother.  I went back in to try and get someone to take a look with me but when i went back in they were gone. I live in the city I thought this was very odd I know what helicopters, stars and planes look like in the sky and this was neither.  I feel a bit weird even posting this but Mr. Davenport always encourges us on coast to post these things so im doing that now.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
5 people and myself witnessed a string of objects grouped tightly together high in the western sky  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-08-08 22:15:00;20 minutes;5 people and myself witnessed a string of objects grouped tightly together high in the western sky and moving north to south.  Very Agile movements and quite fluid.  sudden stops and short bursts of speed.  We all agreed that nothing that we know of manmade could perform these physical feasts.  They seemed pretty high in altitude.  Green, red and white lights yet not Commercial or military or civilian.  Very bright and pulsing not blinking. there was one that lagged behind the whole time and at one point it stopped and just looked like a star.  After the main group had vanished from sight, it proceeded to follow and was changing colors again.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
