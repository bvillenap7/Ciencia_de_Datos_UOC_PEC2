I was facing down town Pittsburgh.  I was in the North Hills.  The bright light started to twinkle, as most stars seemed to do, but then it started to become larger and brighter, approx 3-4 times larger and much brighter, still NOT moving.  At this time, the object immediately condensed back into its original size and brightness and then shot horizontally at a massive speed to where it appeared to be over the south Hills.   It then halted for a micro second, and shot up vertically at a complete right angle into the clouds as fast as it went horizontally.  I never said anything about this until know, because people think you are crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

In a stationary position its lights would change position,intencey, and turn to a red on ocasion. I watched for about 5 min. then the light faded and showed back up over the river with in a min. My self and the others were on our way in to a class we are takeing so that we can be confermed on Easter.It was unexpected and we did have class so we went in for about an hour. When we came back out it was, to our surprize, across the river above the hill moving back and forth Still with the patern of bright lights changeing intentcy and ocasionaly turning red because of the odd movement and light we knew it was the same object. I got in my car hopping to catch up to it and get a better view but by the time I got down to the river I saw the lights one last time about a 1/4 mile away over the river they got realy bright then nothing. That was the last time I saw it.If some one could e-mail me I would like to know if any one else saw it. This is the first time I have seen any thing like this. I just want to know what it was.

3 objects that changed color and traveled, at first, in an upside down triangle shape, then split up were seen on Aug. 13, 2001.;2001-08-13 22:45:00;20-25 MINUTES;3 objects that changed color and traveled, at first, in an upside down triangle shape, then split up were seen on Aug. 13, 2001. Last night (8/13/01) around 10:45 pm, my husband and I were sitting on our bed watching TV.  I got up to go to the kitchen, but my husband was in the middle of telling me something, so i stood, facing him, listening to him.  He was sitting up resting his back on the wall underneath our window, so when I stood up I was facing the window (we had the blinds up).  While I was looking at him, a bright light outside the window caught my attention.  The object was very bright--it seemed to 'twinkle', and was gold in color.  My husband noticed that I was no longer listening to him and asked what I was looking at.  I told him about the bright light in the sky, and just as I finished telling him, I looked back at the object and I noticed that it was now many colors--they seemed to pulsate.  I'm not sure of all the colors, but I know that one of the colors was green and another was red--whenever the red one 'blinked' it was brighter that the others.  Almost immediately after seeing the object start to blink, two other objects 'appeared'.  They were exactly like the first one I had observed, and all three together formed an 'upside down triangle' in the sky.  They were motionless for about a minute, then began moving slowly, staying in their triangle formation.  My husband also witnessed this.  We stayed at the window to see if they would come back, and they did in about a minute.  This time, however, they were not in formation and there were only two of them.  They were split apart--when the three were together they were positioned between 2 trees, so they were in clear view--this time there was one behind each tree.  Neither of the trees were thick with leaves, and the objects' lights were still blinking, so the objects were visible.  They stayed behind the trees for a minute, then went way, then came back about a minute later, then went away again.  We did not see them after this.  My husband doesn't really believe in UFOs, so he keeps telling me that they were just airplanes or helicopters or something, but I ! used to live in Latrobe, near the airport, and also near a hospital, so I know what helicopters and airplanes look like, and believe me, these objects were neither airplanes or helicopters.  Also, my cat was acting really strange all through the night and this morning.  She got under the covers last night to bite and scratch one of my feet (which she has never done before).  In fact, she got so aggressive that it woke me up a few times.  Also, this morning when I got up she started hissing at me and making weird sounds and her fur  was standing straight up, like she was spooked.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

I was outside around 9:00 PM and was looking up at the sky which was cloudy because it had been storming for most of the evening. I saw a little, faint, white light appear near a skyscraper that was across the street. It made no noise, was too high to be a helicopter, and moved unlike a plane should. Instead of a straight line, it zigzagged around in a way that reminded me of a bug, then it disappeared after a few seconds. A minute or two later, I saw three more appear and I watched them zip around in all different directions, then disappear. I asked someone nearby if he could see strange lights in the sky, so we watched for a few minutes, then I spotted another one. He saw it, too, and neither of us could think of what the lights were.

Watched as two abnormally bright lights hovered over a hill for approx. 5 minutes.  The lights became brighter and brighter until one of them shot off to the right at an extremely high rate of speed while the other stayed and hovered.  This is why I called in the 2nd witness to come look at what I was seeing.  We proceeded to watch this light for another approx. 5-10 minutes as it hovered in the exact same spot.  The light then began to move very slowly in the direction of my house. I then proceeded to run outside to get a better look.  When I did all I could make out was a craft that had 3 lights moving quite the opposite as the previous craft in that it was moving slower in the air than anything I had ever seen.  The main emphasis was that it did not make one single sound as it flew right passed my house.  The craft looked to me as a triangular shaped ship about 3-4 times the size of a 747 passenger jet.

Circling yellow light over Pittsburgh;2012-10-06 23:30:00;10 minutes plus;circling yellow light over Pittsburgh I got home from work at approximately 11:30 p.m. on Saturday night, 10/06/12.  When I was almost at my doorway, I was distracted by a light in the sky.  It was a circular hazy yellow light.  It was cloudy and at first looked like it could be light emitted by a plane above the clouds, but it was too large.  I then noticed that the light moved in a circular pattern and quickly.  It was almost like a hawk circling above.  I stood and watched this occur for about 5-10 minutes.  Usually, there are people in and out of my apartment complex and I so badly wanted someone else out there to see the sight but no one came.  I then decided it wasn’t the safest thing for me to be standing outside at midnight by myself in the city with my attention solely on the sky, so I went inside.  I have no idea how long it was occurring prior to me noticing the light or how long it lasted after I went inside.  About 5-10 minutes after I went inside I realized I should have been able ! to see the exact same spot in the sky from my one window, but saw nothing when I looked out.

At first I thought they were searchlights in the sky but realized they were independent lights unto themselves.  How they could escape radar is beyond me as they were very close to the airport.  It seemed like a game to them.   No person could survive being in these craft as the G forces would be tremendous.   Strangest thing I have ever seen.

5 or 6 lights in a straight pattern, fluctuating in intensity appeared and then disappeared in a very short time.;2014-07-13 04:04:00;2 seconds;5 or 6 lights in a straight pattern, fluctuating in intensity appeared and then disappeared in a very short time. I had a restless night and had trouble falling asleep the entire night.  I was laying on my right side and my bedroom window was behind me.  My dog was lying next to my back.  She got up and I turned to look at her and I seen that her tail was between her legs.  Something had spooked her and she does have a lot of sound phobias but I did not hear anything.  I am pretty well versed in canine behavior and body language and have been studying this subject for a while now as I am working towards a career in this field.  She jumped off the end of the bed and went to her “safe spot” underneath the bed. As she jumped, I noticed a bright light in my peripheral vision outside my window.  I turned my head and looked and saw a line of 5 or 6 lights in a straight line moving at a moderate rate of speed.  Maybe like 150-200 mph as a rough estimate.  It seemed like it appeared out of nowhere.   As I focused my eyes on it I noticed the lights were alternating colors of blue and white.  They were all fluctuating in intensity and were going from bight to very bright.  Suddenly, the craft just disappeared.  I didn’t see it take off, it just vanished.  I estimated it to be at an elevation of about 5-7 thousand feet.  I continued to look for the next 25 minutes or so but saw nothing.  The entire event lasted all but 2 seconds.

String of Red Lights at Elevation, Spanning 40 Degrees, in the vicinity of the Allegheny County Airport.;2014-10-11 19:44:00;10 minutes;String of Red Lights at Elevation, Spanning 40 Degrees, in the vicinity of the Allegheny County Airport. We live in Pittsburgh west of the Allegheny County Airport (located in West Mifflin). My wife, walking the dog in our yard, noticed a string of uniformly spaced red lights at altitude (as one would expect a Life Flight helicopter to be) spanning at least 40 angular degrees. She called me to the yard, and I also observed them. I observed (at times using binoculars) that they appeared to be rising, in a spaced fashion, one after another, from a single point in the southeast and heading to the southwest. We estimated they were rising in the vicinity of the airport. One plane observed was perceived by us to be lingering in the area, but the plane, a commercial airliner or cargo plane, subsequently flew over our house, so the perception of lingering must have been due to a great initial distance and we observed it flying into the area. Towards the end of the event, we perceived helicopters to be flying in the area of the airport near the point we witnessed the lights ascending.  The lights were red, similar to radio tower lighting. The light to the southwest most point merely extinguished, and being distracted, but not seeing the others, they too apparently went out. My initial assessment is that they were some man made thing, such as Sky Lanterns lifted by balloon or the heat rising from a candle, but problems exist with this theory.  1. They were launched near the County Airport, which I would suppose to be forbidden for a legal launch, as interference to or confusion of air traffic may ensue.  2. To suppose that they were equipped with electrical power for lighting or being equipped with a candle should have provided the most recently launched light with the ability to travel from the southeast launch point to the southwest extinguish point before itself extinguishing, this clearly did not happen.  I returned to the house and alternately listened to a scanning radio for the police frequencies in my area of Pittsburgh and to Aircraft Frequencies collectively. Nothing was heard to indicate that any others had called to report this incident, nor were pilots, in their very brief communications, mentioning it.  I subsequently noted an establishment across the street from the County Airport as having a Grand Opening sign, but I'm not sure how old the sign is. I drove past the County Airport travelling to work, on following days, but did not notice anything to account for the lights. We perused the media for a hint of a man made cause, but found none. We found this reporting page as a result.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

The lights (approximately 6 ) were  in a horizontal line, except for two, that were in a vertical formation to the other lights as shown below:   *  *                   *                                 *               *  *    They appeared to be stationary, and since I was close to home, I looked for them when I got out of the car but they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Asterisks' orientation to one another did not survive the transfer from our report form to our database.  Original shows four asterisks in a straight line horizontally, and two of them oriented vertically in the center of the formation.  PD));40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

I see a orb or some kind of light start to float up and it went up then it flew over us.  I looked towards my sister who I am one year older than I tell her “Did you see that?!”  Then she said “ I think...”for the rest of the day I’ve been wanting to report this but I am confused and scared please let me know about this.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
Bright, twinkling light zig zagging over Pittsburgh;2019-03-02 22:50:00;40 minutes;Bright, twinkling light zig zagging over Pittsburgh I saw a bright, twinkling light out of my bedroom window, which looked like a bright star, but too bright for an overcast night, so I went to the window to watch it, and after a few minutes, it began to move side to side, then up and down.  It also appeared to have a blue halo, but that could've been due to the weather conditions.  The movement looked like a drone, but I watched it for 40 minutes, and it first moved a distance away and kind of repeated the back and forth motion, then went further away until I could no longer see it, but it was ascending, not descending, so I don't think it could be a drone.  As it moved away, it also appeared that the light was rotating because I would think it was too far away to see, then I would see a glimmer of light every few seconds.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

No blinking lights and too far away/fast to be airplane.  The 2 lights eventually flew right past each other and then disappeared.  Too close to each other to be normal aircrafts.  Too slow to be shooting star.  No reports of any asteroids or meteors.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833

Strange sky and 2 moving orbs of light in the sky.;2020-07-09 20:33:00;00:33;Strange sky and 2 moving orbs of light in the sky. My husband and I were taking a walk in Bloomfield (15224) near the intersection of Cullen Street and Choate Way.  We were taking photos of the sky and sunset after a storm. We noticed a strange light effect in the sky a few minutes before seeing the UFOs.  The light looked like 2 wide horizontal bands that were a little darker blue. We remarked that it almost looked as though some giant craft had gone through the air, pushing the clouds off to the side of its path. A few minutes later, to the right of the light bands, I saw 2 small orbs of light appear from behind the clouds.  The 2 orbs moved around each other almost like 2 flies.  I managed to get a video, although it is shaky in the beginning.  I have still photos as well.  The orbs changed their proximity to each other several times.  The second orb disappeared and the remaining one stayed motionless in the sky for as long as we stayed to look at it.  If I hadn't seen and taken a video of them moving,  I could have been persuaded that the remaining orb was a star or planet.;40.4446928841792;-79.9709945495833
