It meandered slowly through the sky in a weaving motion before it faded to red and then became dim until it was nothing.  It was silent and I didn't see where it came from I just happened to notice it. It wasn't in the air for more than a minute or two, maybe just a little more when it was fading away. I'm not sure if this is relevant or not, but there were FBI in the area near some apartment buildings down the street from the sighting.  They weren't there long and it probably has nothing to do with anything, but I thought that it might be relevant or that it was already reported.;41.8791225;-80.134295
