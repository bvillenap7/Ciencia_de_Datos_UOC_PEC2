Red, fire like ball seen over Edinboro, Pa.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;45 seconds;Red, fire like ball seen over Edinboro, Pa. Our town did not have fireworks this evening (Fourth of July) so many in our area were having their own.   Myself and two others went out to check the town out but as we approached the car I noticed a red ball in the sky, sort of hanging there high up and then it moved erratically across the sky in a jagged, forward motion.   My friends agreed that it was moving strangely and appeared to be engulfed in fire (?).   A father and son stopped their vehicle and saw the object as well.  We watched it until it seemed to either fade out or move away from us. Incredible to see. Any others see this!?!?;41.8791225;-80.134295
