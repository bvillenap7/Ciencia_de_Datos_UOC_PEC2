Good friday Fireball sighted on isolated PA.road;1998-03-18 02:00:00;5 min;Good friday Fireball sighted on isolated PA.road At the time of the incident I was returning home from dropping of my 2 kids for Easter vacation with their mother in NC. I had also been in an accident earlier that day so I was nervous of what I saw. About 5 miles north of trout run which is north of Williamsport Pa. on Rt. 414 heading towards Troy Pa. I observed a round fire ball abort the size of a Cessna 182 at 3000 ft above me at traveling at the same speed a 182 would cruse at that altitude. There are several mountain peaks in that area and the altitude was guess taking in consideration the way it came from behind the first peak and the distance I was from that peak. I contacted Pa. stare police about the fire ball because I was concerned that an aircraft was what I say that may have been on fire. I observed this object for several minutes as it crossed from left to right, eventually passing the peaks on the right. It followed the trajectory that a personal aircraft would, yes it seemed odd that a pers! onal aircraft could travel that far without crashing but I needed a reason to call the state police without sounding like a nut (sorry).  As for my background. I’m Electronics’ Technician holding positions as a measurements Tech for fortune 500 companies ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.4125;-77.0098
