2 large, bright Orange/Amber lights in the sky;2009-10-13 22:00:00;5 minutes;2 large, bright Orange/Amber lights in the sky Driving SW heading down a mountain road and spotted 2 bright, orange/amber lights in the sky directly in front of me.  Top one was slightly to the right of the bottom one.  They were brighter and larger than Venus.  When I reached the bottom of the mountain I made a left turn and lost sight of them.  They were below the tree line. I saw them again  when I cleared the trees to my right. Orion was on my left at this point. Indeterminable distance but when I held up my hand they were a thumb and a half apart in the sky.  Weather was partly cloudy.;40.6879;-76.256
