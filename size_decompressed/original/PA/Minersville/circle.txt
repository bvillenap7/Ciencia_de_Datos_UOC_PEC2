I assumed it was an airplane until a red glow Appeared around the Front and Right side.   The Red glow got dimmer and brighter intermittently and was roughly three times the diameter of the centered white orb?    Suddenly the object began to zigzag left and right, up and down in a very strange manner for a few seconds.   It then stopped and seemed to hover in one location as the red light moved counter clockwise around the white object. After hovering for about 20 Seconds the object began moving slowly towards the direction it came from. Slowly moving north, the object vanished as if someone flipped a switch.    I’ve never seen an aircraft maneuver in this manner.  The sky was clear and full of stars last night when this happened.   I checked the internet for any sightings in the area and I found a video of a rep! orted UFO in Tamaqua the evening before at around the same time of night.;40.6879;-76.256
