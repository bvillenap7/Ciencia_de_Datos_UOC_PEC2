Then as we got closer we noticed it wasn’t a lighthouse.  It was a silent triangle shaped something that had 3 lights on each corner and had a spotlight that was moving around on the ground.  We were in a country like setting about 300 to 500 yards away and the object was about 300ft above ground hovering still.  We got a close as we can in our vehicle then the object quickly oil off and disappeared in seconds.  I couldn’t tell you if it was a ufo or what but it was not a helicopter or plane.;39.7788;-75.8899
