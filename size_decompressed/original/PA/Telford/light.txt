Abnormally moving varying luminocity light.;2010-05-04 21:55:00;2 minutes;Abnormally moving varying luminocity light. light was pointed out to me by my fiance's wife approximately an inch above the horizon. At first it appeared to be a bright star or planet but after around ten seconds the light began to wiggle left and right. At this point the idea of a satellite entered my mind. After wiggling the object stopped for a few seconds and began to rise in a slight arc. The object stopped and began to grow very bright and changed from an off white to a light orange before receding. it stayed still for a few more seconds and then began to wiggle again before shooting off in the general direction of south. I have spent a decent amount of time next to an air station so i know how helicopters and airplanes can and cant move and this moved in ways no aircraft i know of can move.;40.3196;-75.3571
