I went out to my car with my 6 year old granddaughter.  I noticed the full moon and then noticed 5 bright red stationary twinkling lights in a perfect zigzag formation in the sky.  At first I thought they were lights being turned out at a ball field then realized they were slowly moving in formation with no sound.   I started to drive in the direction of the lights and called my parents, whose house I had just left, and told them to look out their front window.  They, too, witnessed the lights but one by one the lights disappeared until they were all out.   I drove about half a mile down the road towards them.  They were way further than I had originally thought.  They slowly disappeared.;40.3196;-75.3571
