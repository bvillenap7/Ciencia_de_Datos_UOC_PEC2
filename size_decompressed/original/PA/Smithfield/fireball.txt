While traveling south on Rte. 43, we (me, my husband and two children) noticed two fireball shaped objects in the sky that were traveling north.  They were staying about one mile in distance away from each other.  They were in the sky lower than the horizon of the mountains on the skyline to the east.  They made no sound.   We pulled over and were able to take a video of one of the fireballs.  We can only best describe the color of the fireball as that of a flickering candle flame.   The size was estimated to be of a Volkswagen Beetle.;39.7949;-79.8058
