In the night sky, driving on PA-43 near or about Smithfield, PA - my husband and I witnessed a bright light appear in the sky.  The light kept motionless for about a second before it traveled a direct route that made it appear to be falling from the sky yet at the same time maintaining a controlled route.  It quickly descended and disappeared.  There was not a cloud in the sky, we could clearly see stars..  The light appeared so bright and out of nowhere then just as quick flew a straight line down and disappeared - did not fade or go out of sight - disappeared!;39.7949;-79.8058
