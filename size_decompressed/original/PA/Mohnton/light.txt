Bright light descends above Reading, PA;2007-01-04 06:00:00;4 seconds;Bright light descends above Reading, PA My husband and I were traveling toward Kenhorst, PA from Knauers, PA on Rt 625 at about 6 AM.  Through a break in the trees on 625, we noticed a very bright white object descending through the clouds.  We only observed the light for a few seconds.   Strangely, the moon was behind us and to the left as we were driving, and it was a very cloudy morning, so I couldn't believe it was a shooting star.  This object was so bright it appeared to be in the clouds rather than behind them.  Does anyone know what this could have been?;40.2587;-75.9877
