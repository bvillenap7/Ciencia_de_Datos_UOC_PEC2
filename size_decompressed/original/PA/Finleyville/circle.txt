6-8 lights right at dusk.;2014-05-17 21:00:00;2 minutes;6-8 lights right at dusk. I turned à corner and 6-8 lights appeared about cloud level.  I am very familiar with aviation and know they were not planes or helicopters.  They were low to thé ground and there was no sound.  There was no body..just lights.  Steady lights, no blinking.  I have pics from my phone and short vidéo of one.;40.2562;-79.9783
