Triangle Shaped Craft (3 white lights and Dull red Light);2010-08-16 22:00:00;5 Minutes;Triangle Shaped Craft (3 white lights and Dull red Light) My buddy and I were coming back from a movie in Philadelphia.  We were at an intersection Hulmeville and Gibson when we saw a really bright light moving across the sky way in front of us.  We got a green light and started moving towards the direction the light was going however, it now was coming in our direction. It seemed to have made a complete turnaround in a matter of 25 seconds or less.  It then changed direction again crossing over Hulmeville road.  At this point I still was not convinced until I got away from some of the high trees and saw it had stopped.  It was just sitting in the sky about maybe 800 feet up give or take.  At this point the brighter lights were no longer on just 3 dull lights (white) and one red light which were not blinking.  All the lights though were dull at this point even the red one. Then I rolled my window down and heard nothing.  I could hear cars, people, and one point even crickets but no sounds that something should make just hovering there in the sky.  It then slowly started to turn and the point or tip of the triangle was pointing downward as it rotated.  Then we had to keep moving and it slowly started crossing the houses over school nearby.  The sighting was about 5 minutes but we turned around about 5 extra minutes to get back to that area and we could not see it anywhere. We looked and looked and nothing.  I believe it was the same craft design wise that me and my ex saw in December 8th 2002 in Croydon.  I believe that this is probably our spacecraft that are reverse engineered off of Alien spacecraft.  This and the one in 2002 are mostly TR-3B or a variant of it.;40.1136;-74.9395999999999
