On 11/11/1999 at approximately 20:20 hrs I was outside my house I looked up and saw an extremely bright object which I originally thought to be an aircraft flying straight across my line of sight from north to south ( I was facing approx ESE ). The object was approximately 40' above the horizon. The object was in my sight for only about 3 to 4 seconds but it was traveling at a high rate of speed ( faster than an F16 on a strafing run ) and then disappeared like a shooting star burning out. In structure the object appeared to be a tight cluster (3 or 4 )of extremely bright red and orange lights. The night was clear and cool and if I remember correctly little or no moon. Sighting took place in a suburban area. Observer Info: I am a computer professional working for a large Insurance company, additionally I am an NCO in the Army National Guard and yes have actually witness an F16 on a strafing run. If I am to be contacted please do so via email.;40.1136;-74.9395999999999
Odd, string formation of orange lights over Philly.;2014-06-21 23:15:00;5 minutes;Odd, string formation of orange lights over Philly. Approximately 2300 On 21 June, 2014, I was standing in the parking lot of my residence, looking south toward Philadelphia.  City line is about 3 miles from me. My home is about 300 yards from the Delaware river. I noticed some very odd, orange, vaguely flickering lights, traveling roughly SE to NW. They appeared to be between 500 to 1,000 feet above me moving at about the speed a small, single engine private airplane might be at cruise. They made no sound that I could hear, and that area is relatively quiet at that time on a Saturday night.  They were not equadistant from each other, and some would fall back, then catch up with the one in front again.  Gaps in the line of objects were not constant, and there were even some stragglers way in back of the main 7 or 8 objects.  I watched untill I could no longer see them because of the buildings and trees nearby. The weather was very clear and cool, I would say near 70 degrees.  Maybe a light breeze. A man driving by had stopped to ask directions had also seen them, and remarked that they looked like Chinese lanterns.  I thought that these things appeared to be operated by something other than a candle and hot air.  They were acting like they were being piloted.;40.1136;-74.9395999999999
