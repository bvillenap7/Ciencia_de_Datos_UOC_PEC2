On this morning, I was getting out of my car for an appointment.  I looked up in the sky and there was this white fast moving Hindenburg shape craft moving across the sky.  It was the speed of a helicopter, if not a bit faster.   Shortly after that I noticed a regular airplane fly by and wondered if they saw it.;40.1136;-74.9395999999999
