25-30 Red/Orange lights in the sky!!!;2014-06-21 23:00:00;20 minutes;25-30 Red/Orange lights in the sky!!! I was driving with my friend on I-95 south heading to Bensalem,PA and we saw these bright red/orange orb-like lights in the sky lined up moving very slow, and more started to appear everywhere, I remember counting how many there were and at one point there were probably 25-30 of these lights.  After about ten mins they just disappeared and when we were heading back home, they appeared again but this time there was 7 of these same lights but closer and bigger and brighter, moving at the same pace in a straight line above us and lasted about 15 mins and just disappeared,, it was wild...;40.1136;-74.9395999999999
