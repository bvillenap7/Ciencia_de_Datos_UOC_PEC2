My first and only UFO sighting in Nottingham Village on Delancy Drive;1998-06-15 21:00:00;15 minutes;My first and only UFO sighting in Nottingham Village on Delancy Drive I was about 12 years old.  We were playing hide and seek,  (We called the game Houses), on my block and while playing, we looked into the sky and saw a saucer shaped ship about 100 feet wide and it had multi-colored lights (red, blue, green) that were flashing sequentially in a circular pattern.  It was huge and hovering a few hundred feet above us for about 15 minutes then rose into the sky rather quickly and disappeared.  I will never forget that evening.
