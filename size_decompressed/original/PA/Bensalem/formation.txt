3 stars over bensalem spun away;1986-05-01 19:00:00;2 hours;3 stars over bensalem spun away It was a little before sundown in the spring of 1987 when I was glancing out of my front door and saw three star-like objects in a triangular pattern over the woods directly across from my house.  I am an amateur astronomer so I looked up all the time and I didn't ever remember seeing a star formation like this one over the woods across the way.  I lived on a dead end street that only had three houses on it.  The woods were the 4 acre wild backyard of a catholic high school.  The objects looked like stars but were brighter than polaris, they were colored white. I thought it was strange but didn't really notice anything odd until I looked out again an hour later and they had moved.  At that time the triangle was rotated to point left.  Originally the triangle pointed down, then an hour later it pointed left then an hour after that it pointed up. At first I thought they might be helicopters, but they were bright enough that I should have been able to make out the other lights on the aircraft if they were aircraft, and they had been flying too long in the same place.  The star-like objects were each at least a degree apart, I'm an amatuer astonomer so I can judge distance in a night sky.  After two hours I noticed that the objects began to rotate faster and faster then after 15-20 seconds of fast rotation they shot off in different directions so fast that I could not follow them.  This has to have been the most amazing thing I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));40.1136;-74.9395999999999
Red lights over Bensalem.;2016-04-08 21:10:00;5 minutes;Red lights over Bensalem. This evening, at around 9:10 p.m., when I left my house to pick up my son, I noticed a whole group of red lights moving in the sky.  They were in a rough formation, following in a line from west to east.  There were at least 12 dots of bright red light.  They could have been planes, but I’ve never seen planes with only bright red lights.  They looked like balls of fire, or embers, floating across the sky.  I’ve never seen anything like it.   I yelled for my wife to come outside.  She was amazed by it.  They were travelling way too slow to be meteors/shooting stars.;40.1136;-74.9395999999999
