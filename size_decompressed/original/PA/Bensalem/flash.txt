Satellite Debris Perhaps?;2009-05-09 22:00:00;15 minutes;Satellite Debris Perhaps? Over a period of approximately 15 minutes going from 90 degrees overhead starting in the northwest sky, I witnessed some sort of object that appeared to either flash or reflect sunlight based on its movement through the sky towards the north. The object appeared to be some sort of Satellite however the inconsistency of its luminance which varied throughout the time I observed it, did not follow any normal patterns I have observed in satellites.  After about 5 minutes along a similar trajectory, I witnessed the same thing again, by I presume, another object or possibly satellite debris.  Finally I saw a third object about another 5 mintues later doing the same sort of inconsistent pattern.  No series of satellites would follow that close in my opinion along the same trajectory unless it is debris from a rocket, or satellite or something else we have not heard of yet.;40.1136;-74.9395999999999
