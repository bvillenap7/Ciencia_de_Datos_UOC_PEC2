The craft was about 80' off the ground and making a shrill humming noise like that of an electric motor. My wife being directly underneath saw a dome shape on the belly with white lights going around it. After the incident we  went about our usual business without remembering it for well over an hour. Also, there was no updraft or even a leaf moving on the ground. My wife also had a rash on her neck shortly after the incident.;40.5384;-75.4293
