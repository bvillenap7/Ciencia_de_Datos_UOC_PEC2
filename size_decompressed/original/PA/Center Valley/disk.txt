I saw several objects playing in the clouds.;2006-11-19 16:45:00;1 minute;I saw several objects playing in the clouds. Sky was 100% overcast. Ceiling aprrox 4000ft.  While driving, I noticed shadows around the clouds, thought it might be a flock of birds. As I continued, saw cloud movement, saw a disk shaped object just poke through the cloud base, then proceded straight up.  Immediately after, saw what I would describe as a big B-1 bomber shaped follow the first, then climb almost straight up. There may have been 3 total.  It almost seemed like they were just playing in the clouds.  I tried to get video with my cell phone, however cannot see the screen well enough to see anything.  When I got home about 15 minutes later, I told my son what I had seen.  He was with several friends,  He yelled, See, I told you!   Apparently he had seen one earlier in the day. The whole episode lasted about 1 minute.;40.5384;-75.4293
