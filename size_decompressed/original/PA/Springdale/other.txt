Very bright,  Star like,  Very High altitude, No sound/s,  Not moving and very unusual for this area ?;2009-07-27 20:35:00;7 minutes;Very bright,  Star like,  Very High altitude, No sounds,  Not moving and very unusual for this area ? At approximately 20:35 EDT/ 00:35 UTC my daughter called me via cell, asking what the object was in the North sky.  With her on the phone, I walked out looking north and seeing nothing, I leaned back looking almost straight up from my location and found the object in a fairly clear sky with high altitude clouds moving in from the Northwest. The Object was at possibly 50 to 75,000 feet. Silver/white, not moving and thought to be a star, one object only.  My daughter stated that she thought the object was moving slowly to the South.   I watched the object for about 1 to 2 minutes, During this time the clouds were starting to block the Sun light. As I watched the object it appeared to roll to the right, became very bright and then I lost sight of it. The object was seen by 4 people total in two different locations.  My daughters location was 6 miles away from my location.  My daughter was sitting out side in a black top parking area with a very large field of view and mine was from my home's back yard with grass and tall trees.;40.5476;-79.7832
