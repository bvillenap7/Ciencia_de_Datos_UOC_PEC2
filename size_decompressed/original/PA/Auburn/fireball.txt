bright red light;2003-10-12 13:08:00;10 minutes;I was standing in my driveway when I saw this bright red light.  I told my dad (hes one of the witnesses) about it.  He was looking at it while I showed my mom. (another witness)  Then my dad got my brothers Mead telescope out.  My dad was trying to get the odject in veiw with the veiw finder thing while I was looking at the object through the lense.  It looked like a rock with red edges.  Then my little brother looked at it and agreed with me.  My dad never got to look at it through the telescope.  However when my dad was looking at theobject with his naked eye (and a little of ne to) thought that we saw somthing hanging down from it.  The object was also silent. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness, a 7th grade student, and the other witnesses, might have been observing a celestial body.  PD));40.5928;-76.1373
