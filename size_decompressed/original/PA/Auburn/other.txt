Triangle formation of three erratically moving starlike lights;2002-09-05 05:30:00;At least 15 minutes;Triangle formation of three erratically moving starlike lights Near sunrise I was looking almost straight up, but facing south,  and saw three stars in a large triangle formation.  They were the only stars visible in that area of the sky.  As I looked at them I noticed that one of them was moving very erratically,  back and forth in a wobbly motion.  Sometimes, it reversed its direction suddenly.  Then I looked at the other two lights, and they seemed to be wobbling, too.  I kept looking at the total shape of the formation and saw that the triangle did change shape, with the light on the right-hand point of the triangle doing the most movement.  When it got closer to sunrise they diasppeared.  I don't think any aircraft could have changed direction so quickly and wobbled so erratically.
