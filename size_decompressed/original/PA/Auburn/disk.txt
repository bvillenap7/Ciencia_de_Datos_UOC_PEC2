It was witnessed buy me, my cousin, & my 21yr.old son.  The 3 of us tried to make sense & find a logical explanation to what we were seeing.  A quick summary of what I seen 3 bright white  balls following all 3 of us in the woods at my cabin located approx. 1m from present sightings.  When they started to get to close to us we got very aggressive & they backed off real quick.  We couldn't understand how these objects moved in a straight formation through the woods. Once they were far enough away,it looked like they turned left to right & all we seen was  a pink a ultraviolet mist of light being sprayed above the tree tops.  There were no beams of light coming from any of these objects.  My present sighting has a lot more detail & some similarity plus things that can not exsplane.;40.5928;-76.1373
