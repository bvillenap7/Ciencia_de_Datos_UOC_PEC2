Rotating Disc seen over Southeast, Pennsylvania;2004-05-09 19:00:00;3-4 Minutes;Rotating Disc seen over Southeast, Pennsylvania What someone saw in Venice Beach, CA is exactly what my husband and I saw on Sunday evening. At first I thought it was a balloon because it was just kind of floating slowly through the air. But then it rotated and I saw that it was actually flat. My husband noticed that it rotated in a systematic fashion - it wasn't just haphazardly moving through the air. It was pretty high, so it looked small, but it wasn't high enough to be a satellite. My husband ran to get his binoculars, but by the time he came back it wasn't viewable anymore.;40.0571838709677;-75.4014741935484
