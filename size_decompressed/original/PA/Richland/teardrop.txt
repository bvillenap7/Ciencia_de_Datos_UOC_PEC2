very black craft passing edge of the moon.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-10 00:30:00;15 seconds;very black craft passing edge of the moon focusing my telescope at the moon I saw a black black craft that wasn't a satellite crossing the edge of the moon, It was kind of like a coke can shape with an L shaped top and seemed to be missing a square piece off the bottom of it.  It was darker than space if it wouldn't have been crossing the moon I'd never have seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.
