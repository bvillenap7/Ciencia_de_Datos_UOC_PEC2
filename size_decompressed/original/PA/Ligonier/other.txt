Puslating Lights, Yellow,  Red, Yellow-Object was completely silent;2012-10-13 05:30:00;15-20 minutes;Puslating Lights, Yellow, Red, Yellow-Object was completely silent On the morning of 10-13-12 I made my way into the woods as I planned on Archery hunting that day.  I sat down in my tree stand which is roughly 16 feet in the tree.  On my way into the woods I had noticed some eyes and deer.  Once sitting in my stand I started to use my flashlight to see where the deer had went as it was still dark out.   At roughly 530am I saw what I thought was a plane or a helicopter go straight up into the sky.  I did not think anything of it however I then watched it come back down to about eye level with the tree line.  Whatever it was it was right through the trees as I could make out pulsating white lights.  All the while the object never made a sound.   As I was watching this happen the lights moved to my left, then to my right.  Once it moved to the right I could clearly see 3 pulsating lights.  Yellow, Red, Yellow.  I was extremely scared at this point as I actually felt as if we were both looking and checking each other out.  It should be noted that I am an avid outdoorsman and leave for my hunting trips when it is dark out.  I have never seen anything like this in my life and I hope I never do so again.   I lowered my equipment out of my tree stand and left the woods heading back for camp.  I get the sense that my wife doesnâ€™t believe me and my friends think I am crazy!  The whole thing that I cant grasp is the way that it moved, and the lack of any noise.  I hope that there are others out there that have seen something like this!;40.2397;-79.2379
