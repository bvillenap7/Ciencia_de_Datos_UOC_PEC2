New Year's Morning siting of spinning lights hovering  over Ligonier, PA;2007-01-01 02:00:00;25 minutes;New Year's Morning siting of spinning lights hovering  over Ligonier, PA I was a guest in my sister's home for New Year's Eve. At 2:15 AM she woke me and asked me to come downstairs to her den. As we looked out of the window (facing east) we saw lights (sometimes two, sometimes three, sometimes four) rotating above the trees. Something seemed to be hovering, moving slightly from side to side....the lights seemed to be oval shaped and I could sense an aura or kind of jet stream as the lights continued to spin. They would speed up and slow down from time to time. I sensed it to be very close to us, but my sister felt it was further away, towards Jennerstown area. We watched it for at least twenty minutes, and suddenly it disappeared.;40.2397;-79.2379

The orange light in cloud cover over the town, about 1/2 hour after a fireworks display.  I went inside to get a laser pointer and came out and pointed at the light.  The light then disappaered.;40.2397;-79.2379
