2 speeding fireballs across the sky slowing up as they were overhead then disappeared.;2015-07-11 21:30:00;1 minute (each);2 speeding fireballs across the sky slowing up as they were overhead then disappeared. Object was bright orange speeding quickly.  I thought it was an airplane on fire. It definitely appeared to be on fire.  It hovered overhead and then a second fireball appeared.  Exactly same direction, location, etc to the first one.  They both hovered overhead (my backyard trees blocked full and constant visual).  One appeared to flash and the other stayed lit.  Then they just disappeared from sight.;40.5672;-79.9708
3 orange fireballs moving across sky in same path at moderate speed;2015-07-18 22:22:00;2-3 minutes;3 orange fireballs moving across sky in same path at moderate speed We were watching a movie in our backyard.  I noticed 3 extremely bright orange lights behind the neighbor's trees.  They each moved across the sky one after the other in the same exact path at a moderate speed.  Not fast but not slow. There was no sound and they twinkled/ pulsated ever so slightly. We're close to a flight path for the airport but I've never seen anything like this.
