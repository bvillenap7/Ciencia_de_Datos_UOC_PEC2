Strange Objects Near Orion's Belt;2010-11-07 00:05:00;over an hour;Strange Objects Near Orion's Belt Looking into the sky near Orion's Belt, a relatively stationary blinking red and blue object which resembled a very distant bright star bobbed vertically.   A good distance higher in the sky a similar object moved about at variable speeds in all directions stopping occasionally.  The blinking red and blue flashes of these objects occured in unison.  About forty minutes into observing the two objects, a third appeared with a large distant search light effect in the sky.  This new object mirrored the other moving objects movements lower in the sky.   The stationary object sat off to the side of Orion's Belt while the moving objects moved in unison sandwhiching Orion's Belt in the middle.  The three objects slowly faded from the sky, like they melted away.  I called my father out to see if he could tell if they were satellites but he said a satellite doesn't blink that way and they move along predictable paths. The two moving objects moved very sporadically.;40.5672;-79.9708
