bright circular light shining down toward the ground.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:00:00;30 seconds;bright circular light shining down toward the ground Plumsteadville, PA  19 Sep 09   approximately 8:00 pm  We had a large gathering for a school picnic on the grounds of Plumstead Christian School on this clear Saturday evening.  A dozen or so of us there saw in the southern sky a bright white light, like coming from a flashlight, out of what appeared to be a circular aperture in the night sky.  It shown for about 30 seconds and then the aperture closed up and the light was gone.  Now there were some hot air balloons in the area earlier in the evening when it was still light out but none of us believe that the flame of a balloon could create what we saw.  The outline of the “aperture in the sky” was very well defined and the light shown directly down toward the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.3829;-75.1395
