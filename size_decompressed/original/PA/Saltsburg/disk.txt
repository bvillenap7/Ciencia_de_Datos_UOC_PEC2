t to the fence fifty feet from us when it seen us it moved behind us and to the top of the trees when it realized we were there I tried to start the car telling my friend get me the hell out of here he pulled the keys out of car and dropped them on the floor and said aliens I want to watch I was besides myself with fear and I had a spot light and I asked him if I should hit it with the spot  light said do not do it i had my 44 mag I said I'm going to shoot at it and he said are you nuts and it came down over top the car and then it put a beam of light on us it was a huge the beam of light was round it was a circle of light around us and the craft made no noise at all no wind nothing but it had different color of lights rotating from one side to the other different colors like red. blue, green, white I was scared to death it sat about four feet above us for what seemed like forever I locked all the doors in the car and was begging him to get me the hell out of there just the! n the beam of light went out and it started to go up to the tr! ee line again and it sat there for about 10 minutes then in a flash it took off and in a split second it took off like a flash of light when it took off it looked like a shooting star and left like a trail like a shooting star my friend already spilled the frisbee and after it took my fried fires up the car and takes off like a bat out of hell I said now you want to leave it's gone the first thing I checked was the time because I saw once were these people were abducted and the lost time so I looked at my watch and about twenty minutes went by everything seemed normal we decided not to tell a soul because everybody would think we are nuts the next morning I went to his sisters house and he had already told her what we saw and she told me to tell what we saw and after I told her she said we have to be telling the truth because he told her the same story I just told you and people need to know what is really going on in their back yard it was in a perfect spot to be hunting animals we! re they would normally be no one around but we were right there were the KECKSBURG PENNSYLVANIA were the alien crash happened so many years ago it was a big deal around here for a long time I never reported this before I want it reported because I've been watching Ancient Aliens religiously and Hanger one and anything that seems real I'm a true believer in aliens now that I have witnessed it first hand and nothing our government doesn't have anything that can do what that craft did and didn't make any noise ok and my second sighting happened as my wife and I were headed to Erie PENNSYLVANIA and I saw what looked going up I-79 north bound about half hour from Erie PA and I  saw what looked like a wing of a 757 with the fat part of the wing going to earth with a green ball of flams at the fat end of the wing and I have never seen anything go that fast nothing can fall to earth that fast and it went strait to the ground my wife and I look at each other and at the same time we ! said did you see that it went into the earth at such a high ra! te of sp eed nothing can go that fast not even fall out of the sky that fast there is something under the earth were that thing went because I called the police to see if any one reported a crash of any kind and they asked me questions about it and they promised me that if anything was to come up about it they would let me know and I  called the next day and still nothing ever was reported about it if it didn't crash it went into the ground there are definitely aliens among us and your a complete fool if you think they are not among us I want to know what the deal really is All I know is I know that we are not alone to many sightings for it not to be real and our government is keeping secrets from us for what I hope is a really good reason to keep the public in the dark;40.5452;-79.3978
