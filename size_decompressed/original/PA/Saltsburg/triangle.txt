Began as white light seen through pine trees for a duration of ~15 seconds.  At first was believed to be an aircraft with landing lights on.  Initially the light was fairly dim but I noticed a gradual increase in intensity through the trees.  After about 15 seconds a triangular shaped craft ~100yards in length emerged from behind the trees into clear skies traveling west to east.  The craft had three large, bright incandescent to slightly bluish colored lights at each point of the triangle.  The craft was completely silent and appeared to be ascending at a gradual rate.  After about 5 seconds of observation the craft simply disapeared as if it was realized that it was being watched (accompanied by a low vibrational rumbling).  I scanned the skies for an additional 15 minutes to see if i could hear the sound of jet engines overhead but no additional noises could be heard.;40.5452;-79.3978
