Around 3am I woke up I found myself in my bedroom on my bed lying on my side.  I saw a female alien 4 ft tall in front of me standing three feet away from me.  I felt 3 male 6ft tall aliens behind me.  As I woke up the female alien was approximately 4ft tall she blew in the dark the colors of a glitter turquoise, gray, silverish mix.  Her eyes looked relaxed and small, but than I screamed and she shape-shifted and grew one foot taller and her eyes expanded upside down almond black.  She than telepathically made my vision go away because she knew I was terrified.  My body was paralyzed I couldn't do anything she was telepathically too strong but within 10mins they disappeared and I didn't watch them ascend etc.  My eyes had been shut.
