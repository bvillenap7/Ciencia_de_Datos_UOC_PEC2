Orange lights over Quakertown, PA.;2015-11-26 17:10:00;10 minutes;Orange lights over quakertown pa. While driving on Trumbauersville Road, headed west, noticed orange light to my left in sky.   Pulled over and then saw several more.  Got out of car and watched as objects passed overhead.  Silent.  Low altitude maybe 1000 ft.   Then noticed more objects appearing in horizon and moving fast towards others. In all maybe 30 total.  Too many to count.  Glowing orange.  Bright.  Several made unusual turns like a uturn then resumed formation.   Maybe 4 or 5 also appeared on horizon to my right and passed over.   The ones on the right were appearing from an entirely different area making me reconsider my first thought of Chinese lanterns and missiles.;40.4441;-75.3449999999999
