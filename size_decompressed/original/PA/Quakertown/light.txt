A blinking red light chased by two smaller lights;2002-03-04 23:05:00;10 minutes;A blinking red light chased by two smaller lights As I do not smoke inside my house, I stepped outside to have my last cigarette of the evening. A fast-blinking, red light not much below the big dipper caught my attention. At first I assumed it was just a planet, but as I watched it the light would disappear for a second or two and then reappear in another place in the sky, though not far from where it disappeared. Also, two distinctly different lights, each an off-white with a faint, bluish tint would randomly streak past the red light from different positions in the sky as though trying to catch it, each leaving a faint haze behind it which dissipated quickly soon after. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I called to my wife to come downstairs and outside to look at what I was seeing. Using telephone lines and the big dipper as guides I showed her where to look in the sky, and to my amazement she began to describe exactly what I was seeing! I went inside to get my video camera, but the lights in the sky were not very bright and are consequently not visible on the video tape. I watched for a total of approximately 10 minutes before the lights stopped all together. My wife and I are not sure of what we saw, but we do know that we did not see a planet, a meteor, an airplane or any other normal aircraft. No other object which either of us has ever seen in our lifetimes has been capable of moving in any way even remotely resembling that of the objects we saw tonight. I hope someone, somewhere, also saw this and successfully captured it on video tape...;40.4441;-75.3449999999999
an object that moved and changed directions in ways airplanes cannot;2010-09-13 20:30:00;5 minutes;an object that moved and changed directions in ways airplanes cannot Approx.same time last year I was looking at a star and it started to move in my direction.  I called two others and it stopped moving so they did not believe me.until tonight when we watched a star start to move, slowly at first did an s-bend , it made a 90 deg.turn twice to head back in the same direction which was North,when it also started moving much faster,until it vanished. This all took about two minutes.  About 15 minutes later we both watched another moving in approx.same direction only it was much brighter.We are talking about when you look up at the stars and a star you can barely see starts moving.I saw this now twice and my nephew saw it too.;40.4441;-75.3449999999999
Fire balls with no strobes moving very slowly.;2013-12-27 21:00:00;5 minutes;Fire balls with no strobes moving very slowly. My girlfriend and I witnessed 2 fireballs in the southern sky, traveling west to east.  They appeared one at a time, changing from orange to red before disappearing.  They were visible in the sky for approximately 30 seconds each, with about 3 minutes in between.   They appeared over a neighbor's roof at an identical spot on the peak, following an identical trajectory, disappearing at an identical spot.  They progressed at an incredibly slow rate, showing no signs of strobe lights what so ever.  (Navigation or anti-collision) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.4441;-75.3449999999999
A bright light traveled across the sky at a slow rate and vanished.;2014-06-18 23:00:00;30 seconds;A bright light traveled across the sky at a slow rate and vanished. Bright light was high in the sky.  Going faster then a plane, but slower then a shooting star without any red light signals.   Went across the sky and slowly dimmed and vanished.  There was not a sound to be heard.  My grandmother and I were sitting in the pool and were stunned.   There was no possible way this object was a plane of any sort.  The object had no shape just a bright light. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be eloquent and serious-minded.  We suspect that his report is a sincere one, and that it is accurate.  PD));40.4441;-75.3449999999999
Moving white star-like light.;2014-10-08 20:00:00;10 seconds;Moving white star-like light. I was sitting on my fire escape, looking up at the stars. I saw what appeared to be two stars close together.  But one of them started to move slowly east.  I thought it would dip below the roof-top across from me, but it didn't.  Instead, it arched upward as it accelerated and disappeared into space within about two seconds.;40.4441;-75.3449999999999
