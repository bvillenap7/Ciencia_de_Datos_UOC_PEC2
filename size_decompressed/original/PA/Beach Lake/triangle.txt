Movement of three from a delta pattern to a line of three.;2006-01-19 19:00:00;twenty mins;Movement of three from a delta pattern to a line of three. To begin the objects that were seen were first in a delta type formation. One at the top of the delta and the other two to the lower left and right but very closely positioned. The colors appeared to be very bright white, green, and red,flashing in a rotating pattern around each object. This observation occured at first slowly and then with a rapid move the objects separated into a line of three, with the center object slighty higher up from the other two. The objects spaced themselves across the horizon equal distant from each other with the exception of the center object which remained higher up on the horizon. This all occured in the Eastern sky. The most predominate celestial object at the time was the constallation Orion to the upper right of all the objects. Once the ojects placed themselves you could observe the blinking light pattern. The only change observed from this point was the light pattern, it went from a delta pattern to a vertical pattern. The objects as observed seemed to get more distant in the sky as time move on.;41.6007;-75.1124
