I saw three bright lights in the sky, hovering in a triangular pattern, just above the tree line across from my subdivision.;2015-07-17 22:50:00;1;I was just sitting outside, watching the sky/stars as I often do on summer nights around this time.  It was around 10:30PM on July 17, 2015.   As I looked at the horizon across from my deck, I saw three bright lights in the sky, hovering in a triangular pattern, just above the tree line across from my subdivision.  One by one the lights moved away from one another.  One light shot off to the left, fairly quickly, but not so fast that I could not follow it's route.  The second went up and faded away, and the third shot off to the right, fading away as though it also went off into a great distance.   I swear to God that I tired to rationalize this in my mind as fireworks, or aircraft, or something.  But please believe me when I tell you that it could not have been any of those things.  The three lights were obviously very high up in the sky, and not only did they hover, but they seemed to bounce around a little bit as they hovered there.  Then they moved of! f in different directions, one by one, as I said. It happened in about one minutes time.  I felt frozen in place, unable to look away for fear of missing this phenomenon.  Folks, I'm not sure if I should feel blessed or afraid, but I saw it plain as day, no question.  Did anyone else see this?  I feel afraid and emotionally touched at the same time, because I truly believe I have seen something extraordinary here.  I always thought this crap was nonsense, but not anymore.;40.3281;-76.0209
