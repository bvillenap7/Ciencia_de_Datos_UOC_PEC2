2 fire-like orbes circling in the sky;2021-09-05 22:00:00;3 minutes;2 fire-like orbes circling in the sky I was letting my dog out last night and I for no reason looked to my left and the were 2 round orange (ish) Like they were on fire,  round crafts moving about in a random travel path. They circled back twice then disappeared. I have it on video but it does not do justice to what I saw. This is the second sighting I've had in this area. The first were 3 small cubicle crafts that had the same color but their texture seemed to resemble hammered metal.;40.3281;-76.0209
