3 reddish orange slow moving lights in the sky;2012-07-29 22:21:00;5 minutes;3 reddish orange slow moving lights in the sky At exactly 10:21 pm my husband I were out smoking a cigarette.  We regularly look up at the stars. One this night, we looked up and saw one reddish orange bright light slowly moving over the tree top and into the open sky.  It was cloud level, so it seemed low.   As it moved it slowly faded and disappeared.  No more than 2 minutes later, another one appears, emerging from the same tree top but this one wasn't as bright.  It was headed in the same direction but did not follow the same path.   One minute later a third appeared and did the same thing as the first two.  I tried to record it but as it was night my phone had a hard time capturing it.  When I turned the flash on it only made it blurry, by the time I switched to flash off, it disappeared.  Now I know there's a meteor shower the 28-29 of July but these were no stars.   Then we thought maybe an asteroid but thought it was weird there was no trail, they moved slow, were cloud height and all came from the same area ! and headed in the same direction.  They were NOT planes, there was no blinking lights and planes aren't a ball of reddish orange.   Approximately a half hour later, we were back outside again and my husband saw a bright blue light flash through the sky.  I however, did not because I wasnt looking.  My brain wants to determine what those lights were, but I can't for the life of me come up with a logical explanation other than a Unidentified Flying Object.  I will never forget what I saw, as this is the first sightings we ever had.;40.3281;-76.0209
