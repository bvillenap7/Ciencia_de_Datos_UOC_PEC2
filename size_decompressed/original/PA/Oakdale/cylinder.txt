Driving northbound on I-79 just past the Bridgeville on-ramp.  It was still light out and visibility was good.  Looking to my left above the distant tree line I saw what I thought was a large airplane flying pretty low in the distance.  There were gray clouds behind the object. Something didnâ€™t seem right so I did a doubletake.  I glanced back at the road for a split second and then back at the flying object.  I was driving 65mph in light traffic.  This time it looked to be closer and hovering what looked to be a couple of hundred feet above the trees that were about a half-mile away.  This time my first thought was that it was a large helicopter as it was hovering, but it could not have been as it was 3 times larger than the biggest helicopter and was a symmetrical cylinder shape.  I got a good look for about 3 seconds.  The unconventional aircraft was dark gray with a dim white light on the left and a dim red light on the right.  There may have been other dimmer li! ghts in the middle.  It was perfectly smooth around the perimeter.  Top outline was parallel to the bottom and the left and right were perfect half circles.  I glanced back at the road and then back to the object and it had disappeared.  I scanned the horizon and it was gone.  I immediately got the chills, and goosebumps and got choked up due to what I has just witnessed.;40.4056;-80.1853
