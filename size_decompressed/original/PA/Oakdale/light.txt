Possible UFO sighting in small town.;2020-11-08 21:15:00;3 minutes;Possible UFO sighting in small town. I was laying in bed when I looked out of my window and saw a light in the sky.  At first, I thought it was a plane, because the airport isn’t too far from my home, but it didn’t act like a plane.  I was staying in one spot for a minute, and then it would move over a bit to the right and stop again.  When it moved, it would leave a trail of light behind it.  The UFO was also fading in and out, like the light would die out and then come back again.  After watching it for a minute, it started making a decent at about at 45 degree angle, but I am unsure if it landed or not.  The UFO was admitting a haze around itself, and looked like a shooting star at first.;40.4056;-80.1853
