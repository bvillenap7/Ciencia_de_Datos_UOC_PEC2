So on March 4th I was up late at night and I seen these two flashes in the sky.  I thought they were planes at first BUT THEN,  The light changed from white to yellow then purple.  I quickly ran and got my telescope (I'm an alien believer myself :) )  I looked through and I seen two teardrop shaped UFO's flying through the sky.;40.2504;-76.8983
