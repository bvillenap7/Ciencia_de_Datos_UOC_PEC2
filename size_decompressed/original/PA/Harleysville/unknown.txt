The lights appeared to be aproximatley 2 miles above the 20 miles ground distance. A friend of mine witnessed the lights as well but discounted it, claiming it must be a plane. When my friend went inside the lights came closer at a rapid rate (1/2 mile away gound distance), stayed at the same altitude, made a sharp 45 degree turn, hovered in place for 20 seconds, untill the lights went off..  I don't really believe in UFOs but what was it? A blimp or helicopter can't travel at the speed that it did and a plane can't make such a sharp turn. Plus all must have their lights on at all times.
