Our heads instantly turned up toward the sky as we heard a loud humming noise. It only took a few steps around the house to see a very low aircraft. It was dark out but the light made it appear in a triangle shape. It was only close to a mile above the ground moving very slow. It looked as though it was slowly trying to land. We jumped in the car and headed to the park it appeared to be landing in. By the time we got there, there was no UFO.;40.2684;-75.3903
