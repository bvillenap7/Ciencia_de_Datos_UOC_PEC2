((anonymous report));2011-02-15 20:00:00;30 seconds;I was just reporting a sighting I saw a few minutes ago and remembered an experience I had a few years ago.  It's a long story so here we go.  About 6 years ago, shortly after moving into my new house.  Me and my mom decide to go for a walk around the new neighborhood. It was very cold out, maybe 25 to 30 degrees.  We were on our way back to our house, and we were talking about spiritual things. My mom is a very spiritual woman. This is a condo community so cars are just parked on the side of the roads in spaces. So were are walking next to cars when out of nowhere this big ball of tiny lights comes out between some cars about 30 feet in front of us.  It went about 20 feet down the road then turned back in between cars.  Me being a curious teenager, ran down the road to look between the cars and nothing is there.  I searched for about 5 minutes around the cars and I couldn't find anything. My mom was convinced it was the holy spirit.  I however thought it was a group of fireflies.  The only problem is that it was far too cold for fireflies to be around. That ball of lights was maybe a foot in diameter and hovered about a foot and a half over the ground.  It made no sound and moved slow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
