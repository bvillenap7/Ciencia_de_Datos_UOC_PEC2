8 or 9 Orange colored lights forming a large circle over Ambler Pa.;2013-03-28 20:00:00;45 secs 1min;8 or 9 Orange colored lights forming a large circle over Ambler Pa. 8 or 9 orange colored lights in the NE sky over Ambler Pa./near Upper Dublin High School I was walking outside to go to my car at about 8pm on 3/28/2013, and noticed in the NE sky several bright, orange colored lights. At first I thought that they were a line of planes on approach to the airport, but upon watching them I realized that they were all about the same distance which appeared to be just a couple of miles and close to the horizon.   Then I noticed another orange light close to the horizon that rose slowly to fall into a formation with the rest of the lights which were now forming a large perfectly round circle which appeared to be several miles wide.  This circular formation of orange colored lights seemed to hover for a while in the distance. I watched this for about 30-45 seconds.   I thought maybe they were helicopters, the way they were stationary in the sky, but there was absolutely no sound. I then went into to get a camera.  My camera was not charged and when I returned the lights had dissipated.;40.1808999999999;-75.2155999999998
