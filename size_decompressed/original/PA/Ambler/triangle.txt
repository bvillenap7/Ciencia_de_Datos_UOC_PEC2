I had a clear view, it was hovering still maybe 500 feet up. I saw it for about a half mile of driving, I pulled over into a parking lot to watch it, I didnt know what to think, I was frozen.  It seemed to fade away, I didn't have the best view at that moment due to some trees so I drove back down the road I came from to follow it and it was gone.  After turning around again and looking where I had origianlly had the best view, there was nothing.  I drive this road weekly at all times of the day. Theres no tall buildings with lights there.  It was not a helicoper.  I have never seen anything like this and I am still having a hard time processing this.;40.1808999999999;-75.2155999999998
