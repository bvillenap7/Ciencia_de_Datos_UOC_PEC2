Time was slowed down to a crawl.;2015-07-12 13:00:00;~30 second;Time was slowed down to a crawl Their was some form of a craft above a house.  Me and two other friends were driving to go see a girl. Their was this boxed shaped craft above a house pulsating some type of pulse down onto the house Strangest shit was we could seee the pulses and as we drove pass the house it was fucking odd cause it felt lien we were in slow motion  My phone and my friends phones died and turned off. It feel like we’re were in slow motion I remember trying to say do you see that! But for some reason my words were coming out so slow.  It had some many cryptic markings on it some the oddly seem to make sense to me and others that I can’t even remember!  As we drove out of the vortex and came back into normal speed!  Are phone turned back on about a quarter mile down the road!  But the weirdest thing was on the way home from the girls house I swear to god to this day a mile of the road house drive ways mail boxes were gone I still ask people if they remember the house were the red mail box no one remembers any parts of this town I talk about except the two that were their and one of them is dead now!  That’s only one of the times!  But I’m not getting into the other one cause y’all aren’t taking me in to exsperment on me to find out if what I could tell you is true!;40.5152;-80.3426
