Glowing orange brilliant orb seen over Bloomsburg, PA.;2016-06-11 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Glowing orange brilliant orb seen over Bloomsburg, PA. What I saw was a classic orange orb sighting.  There was one of them, alone.  It was bright orange, luminescent, sort of plasma like.  Very bright.  I saw it just above the tree lines, Northwest but it was really close -- hovering over the apt complex just above the trees.   It came closer to me, and I thought it might approach me but then it took of to the East, up into the sky past the clouds.  The object made no sound but I heard an aircraft behind it.  I thought at fist it might be a balloon or lantern, but it had a distinct pattern to its flight.   Balloons and lanterns don't move in such an organized, determined direction.  It clearly had intelligence. Behind me was fairly clear.  We live in a fairly rural area and when its dark it gets pretty dark.  The odd thing is though that I seem to be missing some sense of time.  I don't usually do that nor do I ever feel COMPELLED to go outside.  I took photos but it was on one of those cheap cvs cameras so it will take a week to develop.  ty ((name deleted));41.0106;-76.4441999999999
