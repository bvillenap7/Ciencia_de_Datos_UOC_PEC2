Black balloon shaped object on thanksgiving day 1996 in Central PA;1996-11-26 09:00:00;2 minutes;Black balloon shaped object on thanksgiving day 1996 in Central PA I was traveling to my hometown in NW PA. I lived in Bloomsburg at the time.  I had moved there in the fall of 1996 to open a new Retail Electronics Store.   My grandmother at the time was in poor health and she wanted to see my new store. Not being up to travel 3 1/2 hours to see it, I decided to take some photos of it before I left that morning.  I had a polaroid instant camera.   About 20-30 min into my travel on Interstate 80(west)  I looked to my left and hovering in a deep field was this object.  It was shaped like an upsidedown teardrop or Balloon. It was a very dark gray to almost black in color.  I slowed down very quickly as it just hung there.  It was probably 150-200 feet above the ground and seemed to be about 1&1/2 the normal size of a hot air balloon.  That's what I thought I was looking at, except there was no basket at the base tip of this thing.  It didnt appear to have any demension.  It appeared almost flat?? I tried to take a few pictures(still driving) but as I had to wait for them to develop, there was nothing in them.  I really never heard of this kind of UFO before, I wrote it off as a weather balloon or something.  Now I read others have seen this same black shape.  WHAT is it?;41.0106;-76.4441999999999
