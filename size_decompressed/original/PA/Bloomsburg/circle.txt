Rotating disc over Buckhorn seen for a minute, then disappears.;2008-09-24 14:20:00;close to 1 minute;Rotating disc over Buckhorn seen for a minute, then disappears. My wife and I were heading to our daughter’s school to pick her up. My wife asked me if I could see ‘that’. I looked out, towards the direction of the Columbia Mall and the Interstate, and I noticed a gray, circular object, going in and out of view. It stayed stationary, but appeared to be rotating, appearing as a disc, and then rotating out of view. At first we thought it was a dark cloud behind another cloud, but as we watched it, we noticed it had a definite form.  It appeared to be gray to dark gray and non- reflective. The best way to describe the shape would be to imagine a coin shaped object, rotating in and out of view. We lost sight of it when we passed the school building, hoping to get a better look at it from the parking lot, but when we got to a spot where we could view that area of the sky again, it was gone.;41.0106;-76.4441999999999
