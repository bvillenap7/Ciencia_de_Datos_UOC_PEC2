Bloomsburg, PA, June, strange.;2003-06-23 18:00:00;unknown;Bloomsburg, PA, June, strange. Coming home from work, took exit 232 off of I-80, passed the mall, and headed toward Bloomsburg.  From the mall to the intersection at the bottom of the hill, an object, or group of objects, could be seen hovering above the trees on top of the mountain ahead.  It appeared at first to be someone on a parachute, and this formation was quite clear.  While observing the object, I noticed that it did not move.  Therefore, someone on a parachute would be impossible (besides the fact that no one would be on a parachute around there).  It was rush hour, so I assume other people saw this formation.  If anyone knows what it was, or saw it as well, please contact me.  Drawing the object is simple..draw a half-circle (upper half, like a parachute), come down an inch from the center, and draw a dot.  That's what I saw ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));41.0106;-76.4441999999999
I was driving in the car with friends when one of them pointed out what they thought was a shooting star.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-10-24 19:20:00;3 minutes;I was driving in the car with friends when one of them pointed out what they thought was a shooting star.  We all looked up at the 'star' and it turned out to be this big, long string of lights that was moving very rapidly.  We watched it as I drove for about 3 minutes and then all 5 of us suddenly lost sight of it.  The craft was very long and looked like a string of Christmas lights, moving perfectly straight through the sky.;41.0106;-76.4441999999999
