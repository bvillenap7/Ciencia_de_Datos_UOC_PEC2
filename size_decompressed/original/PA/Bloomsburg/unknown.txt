I saw a set of lights in the sky that hovered above the road and then dissapeared;2008-01-03 02:08:00;10 minutes;I saw a set of lights in the sky that hovered above the road and then dissapeared I was going to work around 2:08 am. I pulled into the parking lot and I happened to look up at the sky. About a half a mile down the road was a pair of bright white lights about 50 to 75 feet apart. Between the two white lights were four yellowish-brown square shaped lights. What ever this was hovered above the road about 100 feet off of the ground for about 10 minutes. It didn't make any noise. After about 10 minutes the lights just went off. It might be helpful to know that this happened about a mile from the bloomsburg airport which is a small airport where small single propeller planes and helicopters land. This object I saw in the sky didn't look like and aircraft I have ever seen.;41.0106;-76.4441999999999
strange lightning over a mountain;2008-05-16 00:00:00;half hour;strange lightning over a mountain 4 of us were driving from Penn State to Erie after a graduation and took I-80 east instead of west. I was driving and figured it out after driving 2 hours the wrong direction. after turning around about 1/2 hour later noticed that there was what appeared to be lighting near a mountain. it was a large amount of it and after about 10 minutes after getting closer i said outloud that is not lighting, it was not moving like a storm would, what is that.  after coming around a curve about 10 minutes later there was a huge white light on us. I have helecopters fly in my neighborhood and live near an airport but this was like nothing i have ever seen.  it was huge atleast the size of a car.  since i was driving i was stunded but also i was thinking of stopping.  my 84 yr old mother in law and husband said to keep driving.  my husband saw the craft move over the car and just disappeared. i wanted to turn around but they would not let me.  there were no sounds in the air either so i know it was not any type of aircraft;41.0106;-76.4441999999999
 Pulsing red lights arrive for fireworks.;2010-07-11 00:00:00;20-30 minutes;Pulsing red lights arrive for fireworks. A local carnival was having its and three of us were sitting on our front porch listening to the noises and watching the faint flashes.   We saw two red lights in the direction of the carnival that were slowly pulsing.  They stayed in the same position for the duration of the fireworks and when the fireworks ended they faded away.   The firework show was a good 14 miles away and all of the light but small flashes were blocked by mountains. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD));41.0106;-76.4441999999999
