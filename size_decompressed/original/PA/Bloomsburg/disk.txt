Circle or saucer, 200-300 ft up in the air, stationary hovering no movement. 3 large royal blue lights curved to fit the saucer.  Bigger than a helicopter smaller than an airplane.  Spotted at approximately 9:30 pm in Bloomsburg, PA, over gas station by the Columbia County Jail.  The encounter was less than a minute but once we circled back around to find the hovering un-identified object it was gone.  It was higher than a drone could go but was brighter than the stars.  It looked like glowing led lights 300 ft up in the air.  Very large!;41.0106;-76.4441999999999
