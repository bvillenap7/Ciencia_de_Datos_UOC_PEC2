Light in night sky.;2017-06-01 03:35:00;1 minutes;Light in night sky Was looking in the night sky at stars and seen a light moving from north to south.  Light was only white and there was no flashing lights indicating aircraft.   Thought it at first to be a satellite due to the speed it was moving but it was only white and not changing colors like satellites I have seen before.   I looked on-line to verify it was not the space station and seen that it was not supposed to be passing over at that time.   I watched the light go from north to south for about 30 seconds, and then it went into a cloud and did not reappear.;41.1404;-75.9364
