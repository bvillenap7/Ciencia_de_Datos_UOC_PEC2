My husband and I were driving home about halfway up 8 mi. route to top of moutain where we live.  We were on a flat part where the trees and few homes visible at top can be seen.  We saw at least 2 bright lights in close proximity to each other.  My husband said he had never seen that before, and that it must be on one of the homes.  Then he noted that they were in the sky, not on any of the homes.  The fact that we were a good distance and the lights were so bright indicated to us it wasn't any aircraft we'd ever seen.  Also, it appeared to hover, with no noticeable movement.  There were no blinking lights as often seen with aircraft. I watched the light until our visibility was hampered by thick forest through which the road travels. My husband is truly a skeptic, but even he commented that maybe it was a UFO.  I came out by myself to search about 1/2 hour later, and found nothing.;40.9732;-75.5835
