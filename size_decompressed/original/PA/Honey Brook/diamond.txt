UFO Sighting in Honey Brook.;2015-01-09 23:40:00;1 minutes;UFO Sighting in Honey Brook. Driving home at 11:30 on Friday night from work, saw a low flying object and light.  Thought it was a small airplane, really looked and it was like a diamond shape with a bright light.   Car in front of me also slowed down and hit its breaks.   As I was looking at it, it shot off and immediately disappeared.   First time I ever saw this, and I donâ€™t see or say things like this.;40.0859;-75.8886
