At first I thought it was an airplane but when I got a better look, I noticed it wasn't.  It disappeared over the mountains and about 5 minutes later I heard the jets again.  Looked up and there they were again.  This time alot closer to it.   It went from east to west, circled around and disappeared to the west finally. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Sorry.  This is a sincere report.  I got the date wrong. I was excited when filling it out. I have a few friends on YouTube in NE PA that said a bunch of Blackhawks were out looking for something also.  Have you heard any reports about anything at all?  Plane crash or ufo crash.  It was last night when I seen that. I'm sorry about the screw up ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the date above.  We are unconvinced that this report was intended as a seriou-minded description of a sighting.
