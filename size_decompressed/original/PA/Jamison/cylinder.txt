Five orange glowing cylinders that moved from arrow to diamond formation, no sound or blocking of star field that quickly disappeared.;2015-12-05 21:10:00;10 minutes;Five orange glowing cylinders that moved from arrow to diamond formation, no sound or blocking of star field that quickly disappeared. While walking my dog noticed five glowing orange lights traveling roughly from W to ENE at a slow speed.  Traveled across a commercial/housing developed area over traffic on York Road into my development.  Ran after them looking down 2-5 seconds so wouldn't trip and when looked up they were gone. No noise ever except for background car & truck traffic.  There was no obscuring or blanking out of the star field during or after glowing figures disappeared. Shape looked like vertical circular cylinders similar to glass vessel that hold round candles. Orange glow so bright that no edges of figures were discernible. Height and size difficult to say as size of cylinders unknown. Initial formation was first three cylinders made an arrow head with last two making shaft further back. Last one disappeared and fourth caught up and rotated with others to make a perfect triangle (see figs. 1-3).

Don't make sound but block star field. Aircraft/helicopter?  No sound or blocked star field. Drone(s)?  To precise formation/movements, star field remained, no sound and               expensive equipment for prank and flying at night over busy street with lights out. I hold a degree in a science field.  Reported to police and just recently saw this site to report sighting.  Noticed a report of glowing orange forms eight days prior in Quakertown, PA, and after in other PA towns, 20 to 40+ miles from JAMISON, PA.;40.2577;-75.1054
