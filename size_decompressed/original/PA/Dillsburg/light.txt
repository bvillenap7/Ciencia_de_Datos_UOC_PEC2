At its height it was nothing more than a point of light in the sky and was moving somewhat faster than a jet airliner at high altitude. It left no contrail. I saw it moving for about 30 seconds and then it changed direction very suddenly.  It changed direction fast like throwing a tennis ball hard at a wall.  Or a pool ball hit hard against a table cushion.  From my viewpoint the instant direction change was about 150 degrees.  It then proceeded in a southerly direction until it was out of sight.;40.0958;-77.0345000000001

Vanished after a short time. A somewhat large light shone through the trees, bigger than a plane and not blinking. It was brighter than a plane, star, or satellite, and it was very clear to see as it was dark outside.  The light was white and hovered at first, but began to move upwards at a slow pace. As it was behind a few trees from my perspective, it was difficult to follow, but it continued moving up until it was clear of the trees.  It then seemed to flicker in a single rapid motion to the left, then back again.  It continued moving upwards until it suddenly disappeared.  I was unable to tell whether it had gone behind a cloud, vanished, or left, but it was no longer visible.;40.0958;-77.0345000000001
