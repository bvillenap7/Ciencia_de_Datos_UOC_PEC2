Formation of lights in a < shape that where visible for several minutes and then suddenly disappeared.;2003-01-21 19:45:00;1 minute;Formation of lights in a < shape that where visible for several minutes and then suddenly disappeared. Commerical airliners fly quite frequently into Harrisburg International Airport so the pattern was in the general vacinity.  As I watched one plane heading south to north I notice a formation of 4-5 lights flying north to south.  The altitude was higher then the commerical airlines fly if their about to land or have taken off and yet the lights where as bright as if much lower.  The sky was extremely clear as I live in the country.  This formation flew silently until it reached the Orion constellation at which point as it was crossing it (from my vantage point) the formation disappeared.  I stood there for 5-10 minutes looking for any tail lights of planes in that area and saw nothing. I saw a plane in the north and a small craft far south east but nothing of the formation. Unfortunately I was by myself and had no witnesses.  I spend a lot of time looking at the stars on winter nights and this was very unusual.;40.0958;-77.0345000000001
Light formation over Dillsburg, PA 8-17-2013;2013-08-17 20:30:00;2-3 minutes;Light formation over Dillsburg, PA 8-17-2013 I was at a drive-in movie theater last night when my daughter noticed something in the sky.  My wife and I turned to see what it was and we saw somewhere around 20 - 25 floating lights.  They were moving slowly in a random pattern from north to south.   Right away I recognized these lights from a youtube video I saw that showed various UFO sightings from around the world.  Recognizing these I grabbed my cell phone and video recorded the lights.  By the time I was able to get the camera recording the lights started disappearing and could only get 5 on my camera.   These lights slowly dimmed and disappeared after about 1 minute.  There was no sound from these lights and after dissapearing there were no blinking lights like are required on aircraft after dark.   I did not raise a big fuss to those around me because I wanted to make sure I got them on camera but unfortunately noone else around me noticed them because the movie was just starting.  No aircraft I know of co! uld fly as close as these flew and as quiet.;40.0958;-77.0345000000001
