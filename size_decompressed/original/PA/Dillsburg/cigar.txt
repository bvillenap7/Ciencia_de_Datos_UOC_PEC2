Star like object in sky, swinging sideways and dipping up and down with many colored lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Arcturus?  PD));2013-09-23 08:00:00;>2 hours;Star like object in sky, swinging sideways and dipping up and down with many colored lights My son called me and told me to go to the top of our street as he had been watching this object in the sky before he headed home.  We watched the object for quite some time and it kept swaying back and forth, then it would dip down and come back up.  There were several colors of lights, yellow, blue, green and red.  It slowly moved across the sky and became lower in the sky where it became obscured by trees.  We were looking at it through a very good pair of binoculars and the lower it went in the sky you could see that it was oblong and you could clearly see the different colored lights.  I went in around 9:30 p.m.,  however my son drove out to another location to see it better and he watched it for at least another hour where he said it slowly went across the sky, then just dropped down behind the mountain. Several aircraft were in the area and looked like one actually circled the object and came around.  I am a college graduate employed by a state agency and my son is currently going to college.
