I was in the backyard with my dog when he started barking like crazy towards the western sky.  I looked up and at first didn’t see anything and then suddenly a large bright red light was falling towards the horizon.  I was waiting for it to burn out like a meteor but it got brighter.  I squinted to make out a shape but couldn’t see anything but a bright red light.  I watched it as it fell beyond the horizon, thinking whatever it was was crashing but it didn’t.  There was zero sound with this event.;40.0958;-77.0345000000001
