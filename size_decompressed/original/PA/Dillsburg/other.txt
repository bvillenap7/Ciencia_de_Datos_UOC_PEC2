On this evening I was driving a friend home, we went on all the back roads to get there. On our left we both noticed an Apollo type capsule floating 50 ft. above the trees on the top of a small mountain. It was still and emitted a soft orange glow at the bottom of the craft.  So we both acknowledged this in disbelief. Approaching us was a line of tree that were going to interrupt our line of site with the craft. Unknowingly to each other we both thought watch this not be here after we get past the trees. It took 5-6 seconds to pass the trees and once we did it was gone. No trace. Nothing but our story.  I drove so fast after that! It was really incredible and I've not seen anything of the sorts since.;40.0958;-77.0345000000001
