Woke up at 2:00 am when our microwave beeped because our power went out, then came back on. I saw lights out of the corner of my eye that caught my attention. The object had blue, green, red and yellow lights that were very vivid colors and blinking. It left very abruptly, then the electric went off until 4:00am. I was again woken by our microwave beeping when the power came on. I looked out the window again and saw another object but a different shape and only blue and red lights flashing very fast. I saw it only for 30 seconds or so then it left. The power again went off the came back on a few moments later. I closed the blinds after that. I check with the local authorities the following day and they said several transformers had blow due to a power surge at the local substation. This is just too weird.;40.0958;-77.0345000000001
