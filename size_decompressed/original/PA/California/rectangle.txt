About 7:15 am My attention was caught by a square white object moving across the sky. It moved steadily, in a straight line, without wavering, through the sky, about 30-40 degrees above the horizon. I moved from the Northwest to the Southeast.  The sky was clear, no air moving at ground level.  The morning sun lighted it nicely, but I could not detect any shape except the square no hint of a box.  There was no sound.  Believe it was much closer to the ground than the jets which pass over here and I can't say how large it was  but a leaf of my maple tree would have hidden it, a leaflet of my rose bush would not.;40.0703;-79.8941
