Once they were in the yard, I turned around toward the driveway, for no apparent reason, and looked up at the sky.  That is when I saw a bright white circle with a cone-shaped light shining underneath it. It was hovering over one area.  The circle was brighter than the light underneath it.  At first I thought it was a star, because other stars were in the sky, but then I realized it was much too big to be a star.  I ran inside to get my husband, but by the time we got back outside (less than 10 seconds), the circle of light had disappeared.  There was, however, a very faint bit of light remaining that looked like a cloud. The remaining light was initially the cone-shape that was there when the circle of light was still visible, but once the circle disappeared, the cone-shape also dissipated.  I told my husband that it must’ve just been a plane passing through a! cloud, but then I realized there were no clouds in the sky and no plane ever reappeared, as it would after it passed through the cloud.  My husband said, “there’s a cloud right there,” but what he thought was a cloud was actually the fading light that remained after the circle disappeared. I waited for about 5 minutes by myself to see if it returned, but it did not.  The “cloud” completely disappeared after about 2 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.
