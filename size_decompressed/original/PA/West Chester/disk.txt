At dusk, it came towards me with a constant speed and altitude of ten meters and multiple lights flashing with absolute silence. The way that I judged its size was that I saw that it would just fit inside the two car garage that it flew over. I remember that there were several reports of similar sitings in the local newspapers. It was 1973. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
saucer object cutting through full moon, south to north;2005-10-17 21:00:00;5 seconds;saucer object cutting through full moon, south to north My almost two-year-old daughter and I were sitting in our driveway watching the full moon rise from the East.  We had a clear pristine view of the moon clear sky no clouds.  While watching, a thing (disk) flew from South to North across our plane of view.  It was way off in the distance, yet still clearly visible as it cut through our view of the full moon.   It actually seemed to slow down for a second or two, then sped off to the North.  Once outside the scope of the moon, it wasn't visible.  All black with no lights.   Again, it was way off in the distance, and yet it appeared very large in front of the moon.  This must have been enormous.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516

Large circular shaped craft with bright and consistant pulsing lights on outer perimeter.;2011-09-16 06:00:00;2 min.;Large circular shaped craft with bright and consistant pulsing lights on outer perimeter. Large circular shape with bright and consistant flashing or rather pulsing lights on outer perimeter of craft traveling low and in a very quiet and fluid motion from east to west in the early morning sky.  I'm stunned as this is my first observation of what I assume was a UFO?   I was taking the dog out this morning when the bright lights caught my eye so that I looked skyward for the explanation - the fact that they were in a large format,circular and consistantly pulsing also caught my attention.   I became more amazed as it glided over head and I realized I had never before seen or experienced anything like it.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
2 White discs spotted near my home in West Chester Pennsylvania;2016-06-29 13:34:00;10 minutes;2 White discs spotted near my home in West Chester Pennsylvania It was a very clear day, no clouds in the sky so i could see nothing but blue sky above me. And out of nowhere 2 white discs appeared in the sky, they remained in the sky for about 10 minutes then slowly faded into the sky. These are not your stereotypical UFOs, these UFOs suddenly appeared in the sky, then slowly materialized away. I was on a walk at the time and accidentally left my phone at my home, so I ran home and called the sighting phone number on the website.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
