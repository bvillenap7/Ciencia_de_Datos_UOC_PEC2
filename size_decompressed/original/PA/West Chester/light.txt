Extremely bright flashing orb seen directly overhead.;2009-08-20 21:50:00;5 minutes;Extremely bright flashing orb seen directly overhead. On the evening of August 20, 2009, my mother and I were out on our deck at approximately 9:50 pm with the porch lights off to look for satellites.  I was facing almost directly west, looking up towards the Big Dipper, when I saw a bright flash out of the corner of my eye.  I looked where I had seen the flash, in the constellation Hercules, near the star Sigma, and saw a reddish point of light traveling south through Hercules. I stood up, watching it, and said “What the **** is that?”  My mother looked up where I was pointing, and as she did so, the object flashed again.  The flash was extremely bright, and it charged up first, flashed bright enough that it almost hurt the eyes, and then dimmed back to the reddish color again.  It proceeded to do this 2 more times as it traveled through Hercules, past the stars Eta and Epsilon, and then continued without flashing until it faded from sight.  I can’t imagine that anyone in the area looking at the sky that night didn’t see it. About an hour later, I was outside by myself smoking a cigarette, and a small reddish light that I believe was the same object came back through the sky going the opposite direction, coming from the southwest, curving around Vega and then continuing northeast until it passed behind some clouds.  A flash was seen behind the clouds, but I can’t be sure that it wasn’t lightning.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
I looked at the sky outside on 1-10-2012 and to the west and south saw two sightings amongst a tremendous star filled sky. The sighting;2012-01-10 21:00:00;i hour;I looked at the sky outside on 1-10-2012 and to the west and south saw two sightings amongst a tremendous star filled sky.  The sightings moved a bit to the left than to the right than back to their original position.  Each seemed to have a small blue band of light cresenting up from it , then the light would disappear.  At one point early in the sighting I heard sounds that sounds similar to the sound that dolphines make under water.I watched the one in the west sky for an hour.  It at times had multiple small beams of light, hair thin , darting out from it, at one point it looked like a light show of color, then the colored lights would stop.  It would move a bit at times.   I am a teacher with a Master's degree in arts and psychology, I am 53 years of age and NEVER HAD ANY PSYCHIATRIC CARE. THIS WAS VERY REAL WHAT I SAW.
