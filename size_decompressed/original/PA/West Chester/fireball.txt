6-8 Bright reddish orange fire balls in the sky;2009-09-19 22:15:00;1 Minute;6-8 Bright reddish orange fire balls in the sky There were about six-eight bright orange what resembled fire balls in the sky.  The very last fire ball was surrounded by red lights.  They were very low in the sky, and amazingly extremely quiet.  There was absolutely no noise.  They formed the shape of a hook or a cane.  They for sure were not stars because the stars that were in the sky were bright (white or blue).  There were clear fire balls (UFO’s). I immediately knocked on the neighbors' doors and they were amazed.  A few seconds after the neighbors came out, we all got our camera phones and began pointing and taking pictures.  At this point, they began to disappear (one by one).  They began to fly deeper into the universes instantly.  I was able to capture a picture on my phone but the amazing thing is, while I could see them in the view of my phone (I saw exactly four of the UFO’s on my phone screen, only a partial picture came out).   My neighbors were unsuccessful of obtaining a photo. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
