Red blinking light circles stationary white light.;2005-08-15 21:30:00;15-20 sec.;Red blinking light circles stationary white light. Saw a 'star' appear in the sky, still dusky so didn't think anything of it.   Then a red light blinked next to it, thought it was a plane at first.  On closer inspection, however, the light was moving counter-clockwise around the 'star.'  It went around once (the red light), then blinked brightly and faded out.   Went inside to tell mother, not sure now if the original white 'star' is still there since I moved and I'm not sure if I'm looking at the same 'star.';39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
ufo sighting 1/14/2009 around 6:35 pm just slightly south of town of West Chester, Chester County, Pennsylvania. 3 Large red/orange lig;2009-01-14 18:35:00;5 minutes;ufo sighting 1/14/2009 around 6:35 pm just slightly south of town of West Chester, Chester County, Pennsylvania. 3 Large red/orange lights moving back and forth but with smooth precision almost effortless. To high in the sky to be a helicopter, no sound of course and movement to quickly to be any type of airplane. Lights did not resemble an airplane in fact an airplane was noticed at the same time at lower altitude with its blinking light to the north west of my house heading east towards the philadelphia airport. These 3 lights hung just south east of our home in west chester and moved slowly up and down and sideways in a quick manner. Slowly it disappeared in the sky moving upward. I waited because I wanted to see more.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
Strange irregular shaped object, possibly some kind of baloon, sending photo.;2016-09-04 19:18:00;2-3 minutes;Strange irregular shaped object, possibly some kind of baloon, sending photo. May have been some sort of balloon but a very strange shape and quite high up.I took multiple pictures during the short time visible before being blocked by trees. It had to have been quite large as it caught my eye at a long distance from my deck. I happened to have my micro 4/3 camera out with a 70-300mm zoom lens on it zoomed to the max and have a few pictures that are not 100% in focus due to the distance the object was quite small and moving making it hard for the camera to focus on.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
three vertically attached bright white stars wobbling left to right;2020-07-11 22:00:00;10 minutes;three vertically attached bright white stars wobbling left to right Sitting on the second story deck about 10 PM.  Dark cloudy night but the clouds started drifting apart.  A few stars appeared then a VERY bright one which looked like three stars stacked right on top of each other.  Thought it might be a plane but it did not move, then it began to wobble left and right while not leaving it's position.  Then clouds came in and obscured it.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
