4 fireballs turn into 8 Orbs, pursued by helicopters and F-16 Jets.;2013-08-27 01:15:00;on-going;4 fireballs turn into 8 Orbs, pursued by helicopters and F-16 Jets I am drafting this report as the event is on-going.  I was in bed around 0:50 and heard what sounded like helicopters outside.  I went out back and looked toward town, which is directly due west, and noticed that the night sky was lit up and the helicopter noise was coming from that direction.  Out of no where, 4 Orange-Red Orbs/Fireballs/Lights rose over the tree line, moving away from each other in a North-South direction.  Shortly after, each of the balls split in half and moved toward my location (East).  After the lights split, I noticed that in both the North West and South West skies, just barely above the trees, two helicopters were hovering.  4 of the lights flew directly over head and were immediately pursued by a Black Helicopter with Blue and Green flashing lights.  The helicopter turned off it's spotlight as soon as it started pursuing and as far as I could see, did not turn it back on.  The other 4 light are still sitting in the South Western Sky.  Also, shortly after the 4 lights flew east, two Military jets flew in from the south (assuming from Dover Airforce Base, which is less than an hour flight at that speed) and headed North East.  The jets were traveling at at least Mach 1 because as they flew overhead, at a very high altitude (barely visible to the naked eye), the produced a simoultaneous sonic boom, which shook my deck. UPDATE:  4 lights are slowly rising higher and higher.  Helicopter has turned off its spotlight and has ascended with the lights.  Helicopter is holding steady at about half the lights altitude.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
