Large grey cigar shaped object.;2009-04-22 16:00:00;5 seconds or less;Large grey cigar shaped object. I was walking my dog at around four in the afternoon, and I looked up to see an object in the sky.  It was at least two to three times the size of an airplane, and was dark grey.  It was slightly angled upwards, and almost looked bent.  I could not tell if it was moving very fast horizontally, or not at all, as I was walking to get a better view.  By the time I had found a good place to view it, it had disappeared behind clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides little contact information.

My last sighting was not a hoax.;2009-04-22 16:00:00;5 seconds;My last sighting was not a hoax. I sent a report a couple years ago of a possible UFO sighting.  I noticed that there was a NUFORC note about my lack of personal information.  In order to clear any possibility that this sighting was thought to be a hoax, I wanted to provide the information I may have left out before.  Please understand that I only was weary of internet privacy.
