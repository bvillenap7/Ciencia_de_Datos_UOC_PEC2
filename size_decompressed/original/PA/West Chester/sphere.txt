Small, spherical white light object traveling rapidly  [horizontally]  with no noise.;2000-12-07 17:50:00;5 seconds;Small, spherical white light object traveling rapidly  [horizontally]  with no noise. On the evening of December 7, 2000 at approximately 5:50 PM, I had just stepped out the front door of the house to take my mother grocery shopping when I saw a small, spherical white light approaching from the southeast[horizontally]at a very rapid speed. I called to my mother to come quickly and as she stepped out the front door, this object flew right over our heads, about 10 feet above the roof of the house [It's a 2-story house]. There was absolutely no noise what-so-ever. My mother was very startled and said What was that?. I said What do you think it was? Did you hear any noise like a helicopter or a plane?. She said No. I said It was a UFO. She didn't want to believe that but it was a clear night with no storm in the forecast and I have never heard of any reports of ball lightning in this area.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
seven orbs spotted over south east pa.;2007-09-02 10:50:00;30min;seven orbs spotted over south east pa. I was looking up at the moon which is half full and visible in the daylight when just to the right of it I saw 7 round orbs, some were brighter than others but they were not moving.  I watched for about 3 in awe before i remembered that i had my camera on me so i pulled it out and tried to take some video, i also took a few still frames. I showed the orbs to a few people that were on the street but i am unsure of how many people in town saw it. I will download my photos to my laptop and will try to send them to you so that you can draw your own conclusions. is there any way that you can let me know if anybody else is reporting this,no names of course i just want to know that i am not loopy. The configuration looked like this:   o              o    o     o    o                               o  o    Thank you for listening;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
1 sphere like round firework. Still. Turned into 3 spheres. No sound until deep hum. No movement @1st. Then 3 from NW to SE.;2020-12-24 23:30:00;5 minutes;1 sphere like round firework. Still. Turned into 3 spheres. No sound until deep hum. No movement @1st. Then 3 from NW to SE. It looked like a stationary firework display/like a patterned ball.  But not moving or arc-ing. I thought someone had put up some sort of display on a tower but there is no tower over there.  I ran in for the phone/camera.  Then the huge ball that was like a frozen firework started moving up, then forward, this direction.  I kept trying to get photo but it wasnâ€™t happening.  Then it was 3 round lights, 3-D, like almost a plane formation with port and starboard but also front , triangular like a plane, but still these round patterned globes it got closer, lower, no noise until a very low bass hum, not like an engine.  Impossibly low in sky.  Still these round 3-D static firework-like globes.  Then past where I could see.  Nothing wrong with my eyes/I kept looking to see if there were auras around street lights.  Nothing. Freaked. Heart-pounding experience.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
