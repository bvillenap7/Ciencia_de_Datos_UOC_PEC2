Strange black image passed quickly across the sky on a clear autumn night.;2005-10-17 20:50:00;1 minute;Strange black image passed quickly across the sky on a clear autumn night. We (my husband and I) were taking a break from an evening walk in our neighborhood park, when he pointed out a strange black figure passing across the moon.  At first we thought it was just a large bird, but it seemed to come to an eerie, complete standstill for almost 10 sec., rather than circling as a bird would do.  Then it took off so incredibly quickly, that a bird didn't seem likely either.  It also appeared to be way too high to be a bird, too.  The object was not a perfect circle, but close.  No lights as far as we could see...as the moon was so bright that night, it just seemed black against it.  By the time it disappeared (I'd guess toward the northeast?), we were certain it was not a familiar creature to us, but something much more mysterious.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
5 flame colored orbs flying in formation then fading into the night.;2013-09-15 20:30:00;2 minutes;5 flame colored orbs flying in formation then fading into the night. I was sitting on my front step on a cool evening at approximately 8:30pm EDT.  I saw 5 flame-colored orbs rising over a line of trees in the formation identical to that of the number 5 as it appears on dice.  That is: 2 orbs in front, one orb centered between the two in the middle, and two orbs in the rear that were even with the two in the front.  They were in a definite formation. My first thought was that they were military planes or helicopters, but they made no sound. They moved silently across the sky from South to North.  Then the middle orb moved out of line and advanced toward the orb positioned in the front left.  They appeared to make contact with each other and the center orb flickered out. Immediately after that the remaining orbs began to fade out one by one until the front left orb was the only one remaining.  That one floated on for a few seconds alone then it also faded out. The objects faded out with an appearance similar to when you blow out a candle.  The fiery orange glow faded to a single point of light and then went dark in the night sky.  I continued watching where I expected their trajectory to go but I could not see them once the glow had flickered out. What did I see tonight?;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
