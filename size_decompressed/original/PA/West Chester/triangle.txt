Triangular craft, flashes of light;2004-08-24 23:02:00;5 minutes;Triangular craft, flashes of light On my way home from work at maggie moos ice cream at approximately 11:02 I was going down an off shoot road from 322 when I saw a triangular craft in the sky it had red lights at all the corners of the craft and blue lights in between. In the center of the craft was a glowing white sphere. It acted like a giant flash on a camera. The sky lit up multiple time. I al so saw two more hovering over a cornfield in front of my develolpment. When i ran to get my camera they had dissapeared. I could do a drawing of the object if needed.

Small triangular object with multi-color lights slowly moving;2010-03-05 22:00:00;30 minutes;Small triangular object with multi-color lights slowly moving West Chester, Pennsylvania  Sighting Time: 10:15 through 10:45   Location of object:  West of town about 10 miles   Object was small and triangular in shape.   Lights consisted of green, red, and orange. Looked to be hovering around 3,000 feet and slowly moved North/northeast while moving to 5-7,000 feet. The light several times went black and then appeared almost like a dimming and re-appearing. Observed object for 30 minutes, before loosing site. There was no sound from object that I could tell and saw no other object approaching or around.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
Slow low flying unidentified craft;2012-01-17 23:00:00;8 - 10 minutes;Slow low flying unidentified craft Front of craft had multiple very bright white lights, something between 3 and 5.  Craft was flying very low level and moved very slowly, appeared to be heading from north to south with no deviation of course.  Back of craft revealed blinking red lights, two or three.  This craft travelled within a very close distance of Brandywine Airport, but passed it by.  When the craft travelled overhead a sound of a jet engine was present but very faint.  Was very odd for the slow speed of the plane and very low sound output.  I was surprised the craft did not fall out of the sky.  It appeared to be moving no faster than 40 mph.  Any assistance that could be provided with finding out if this was one of ours would be greatly appreciated.;39.9641593103448;-75.5871668965516
