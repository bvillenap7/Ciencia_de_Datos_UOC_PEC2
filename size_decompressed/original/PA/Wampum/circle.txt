3 bright round objects hovering on side of road during bad snowstorm;1985-01-15 03:00:00;30min;3 bright round objects hovering on side of road during bad snowstorm while driving home from the Pittsburgh International Airport after a flight from Chicago in the early morning hours during a snowstorm, I saw three very bright lights hovering in humming bird fashion (up and down, left and right)in the sky. All of the main highways were closed because of the storm and I was afraid I would not make it home due to the weather. I had a 60 mile drive and could not see the road and had to drive 20 mph. I pulled over to view the objects and after about 30 min. I decided to leave...I was hoping that another witness would come by but none did. I could not believe how fast I got home considering the weather but when I arrived home my wife was very upset and said I had been gone over 5 hours...I could not believe it because I thougt I made it home fast considering the driving conditions!;40.8819;-80.3392
