6 circular object moved in straight line across the sky going west.;2008-09-28 00:15:00;1 minute;6 circular object moved in straight line across the sky going west. At approx. 12:15 a.m. on Sunday, 9/28/08 outside of New Columbia, PA at the base of a mountain,  I witnessed 3 glowing circular objects moving across the sky.  Initially, I thought it was aircraft, but these objects were moving slower than an aircraft.  It was very cloudy & foggy tonight.  These objects were clearly visible, travelling under cloud cover.  I watched these objects for approx. 20 seconds before running and getting friends to see this.  When we returned, the initial 3 were gone, but 3 more appeared on the horizon through the trees.  Again, these 3 objects were glowing and circular moving in a straight line, one after the other across the sky.  All 6 in total were an orange color & were travelling west.  There were no flashing lights, but each seemed to have a haze around them.  From where we were standing, they were about 4 inches apart in the sky.  We then watched these objects slowly disappear / vanish in the sky.  They did not emit any sounds we could hear.  This incident, from initial sighting to last sighting lasted about 1 minute.
