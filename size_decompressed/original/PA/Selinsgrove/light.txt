Bright star that orbits another star?;2014-02-18 00:00:00;all night;bright star that orbits another star? looks like a star, but if you look close there is one light above another with a third light rotating around the top light.  It moves across the sky with the stars and is straight up in the sky.   At 3 am it will be moving towards the horizon.  I noticed it last night and is there again tonight.   Straight up at 7 pm. satellite?;40.8191;-76.8690999999999
