Then, 2 more craft of same appearance and speed appeared to the north west.  One craft moved toward the southeast and the other craft moved toward the northeast at about the same speed.  Speed of all crafts were greater than generated by man.   About 7 minutes after the craft disappered, 2 jets flew by seeming to chase the craft(s).
