Large Blue Sphere Over Susquehanna River, Selinsgrove PA, in the early morning hours of April 28, 2020;2020-04-28 07:20:00;15 seconds;Large Blue Sphere Over Susquehanna River, Selinsgrove PA, in the early morning hours of April 28, 2020 A large bright blue spherical light was seen over the Susquehanna River, Selinsgrove, PA, (USA) at 7:20 AM on Tuesday, April 28. 2020.  Out for a morning walk, we stopped at the boat launch at the Isle of Que in Selinsgrove, looked up, and saw the blue light over the water coming from the direction of the Shamokin Dam power plant.  If one looks to the left of the object, they will see the steam stacks from the power plant.  I quickly took the picture on an iPhone 7.  The camera mode was set to live on the phone.  The image on my phone is moving from the water to the mountain quickly.   I am only able to transfer the still image.   I was able to magnify the light, as seen in the second picture that was sent to ufocntr@nwlink.com;40.8191;-76.8690999999999
