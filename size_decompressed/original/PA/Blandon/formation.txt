We questioned each other about what they might be, and decided to attempt to follow.  We continued to see them for about 3-5 minutes, but then lost track of them through the trees, while driving.  They were hovering, seemingly just above rooftops, briefly hesitating and holding still at times, but mostly moving slowly across the sky.  The red and blue lights along the V were very pronounced, and stead not blinking. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));40.4425;-75.8863
