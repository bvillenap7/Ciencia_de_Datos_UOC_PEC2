UFO over Oil City, PA 1975;1975-04-25 00:00:00;2-3 minutes;UFO over Oil City, PA 1975 It was either late April or early May of 1975, when I heard a loud humming sound (much like that of a generator) outside our house on ((deleted)) Colbert Ave. I looked out our bedroom window on the second floor, that faced Colbert Ave., and saw a saucer type object about 75 - 100 feet above the house directly over Colbert Ave. A red pick-up truck (Ford or Chevy) either a late 60's or early 70's model was stopped in the street in front of our house. The man in the truck had one arm and this head outside the truck window and was looking up at the saucer. My younger brother got up at this time and looked out the window beside the one I was looking out, and also saw the saucer. The saucer stayed in place for about 30 sec. to a minute, then took off across the Allegheny river and over a Quaker State tank/drum on top of the hill, within a second. We tried to wake our mother up, but see told us to go back to sleep. The next morning we asked other kids on the block if they saw anything, no one did. The saucer looked about 30 feet long and about 15-20 feet high. It appeared to be made of a silver metal, with a dark gray circle around it. Appeared to be a large window (very dark) just above the ring around the saucer. Their were lights on the top and bottom of the saucer that were yellowish/white and they pulsated (may have been causing humming sound). I was 11 years old at the time, and my brother was 9. This vision has always been very clear, and I have never seen another since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.4355;-79.6904
Black craft with colored lights over Oil City, Pennsylvania.;2015-09-01 20:30:00;10 minutes;Black craft with colored lights over Oil City, Pennsylvania. 	Around 8:30 PM on September 1st, 2015, my significant other and I witnessed some kind of craft hovering over the center of our city.  We were facing North, and we live at the top of a hill in our city.  We are both in our early twenties and work most of the day, so we spend most of our time on the back porch at night.   That night we witnessed what I can only describe as a black twinkie with reddish-purple lights on both ends, and a very bright blue light in the middle of the craft, situated at the bottom.  The lights on the side would change from bright red to a very deep maroon, almost purple.   There was no reflection on the actual craft itself from these lights, although there were halos of the same colored light around the craft.   We watched it for at least a minute, as it was motionless.  I thought it to be a satellite or some kind of plane, but then it began to move.  The movement was erratic, moving in zig-zags and up and down at an extremely fast speed.    We watched it move for about 45 seconds, until it came to a halt.  It moved slightly upward and then just seemed to disappear.   My significant other and I have witnessed this kind of craft in the same location before, once on July 22nd, 2015, for about 10 minutes at 10:45 PM, and once again on July 15, around midnight, for less than 5 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite eloquent and serious-minded.  We suspect that she is a very good witness.  PD));41.4355;-79.6904
