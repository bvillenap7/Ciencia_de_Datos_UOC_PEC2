My brothers and I were listening on the CB radio (it was big back then). We heard a lot of excited chatter from people saying, My God, there's another one...  Lots of people were headed to the vocational technical center, adjacent to Oil City High School to get a better view. So, my brothers and I climbed into our family car and drove up to look too. What we saw was clearly three to four bright lights in the sky, seperated by many miles moving in odd geometric directions.  Almost as if dancing in the sky. It was a clear winter night and the stars were vivid. There were hundreds of wittnesses to this event. I have NEVER told anyone about this. It so impacted my younger brother that he actually returned to Oil City to interview people for a book he wanted to author. He has the original taped interviews from several police officers who saw more (e.g. saucer shaped craft hovering above the Allegeheny River). He also has the notes from several other interviews. My brother told me later after he began his research that the Air Force scrambled F-4's from Pittsburg to investigate (I don't know if that is factual, however).
