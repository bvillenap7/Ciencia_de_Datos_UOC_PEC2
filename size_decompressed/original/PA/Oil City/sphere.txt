Two pale green lights in night sky.;2017-09-02 21:30:00;10 to 12 seconds;Two pale green lights in night sky My wife and I were in our hot tub around 930 at night, when in the eastern sky, we saw a white glow out of the glow shot 2 pale green lights that were coming straight in our direction, then suddenly banked off to our left, then the green lights and the glow all disappeared at the same time, like someone flipped a switch.  my impression was it was like a portal opened and a craft flew threw I think the green lights were one object, but my wife tHought the 2 green lights were 2 separate objects it made no noise it was perhaps a half mile away...very strange.
