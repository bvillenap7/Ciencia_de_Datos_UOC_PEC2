Fireball Reported From Various Locations of Pennsylvania;2001-10-02 19:30:00;seconds;Fireball Reported From Various Locations of Pennsylvania During the evening of 10-02-01, I received reports that fireball sightings were reported from Warren County, PA near the New York line. One witness I interviewed, said that she saw a huge blazing orange ball of fire moving north. During the evening I learned that other similar reports originated from Armstrong and Mercer Counties.  I was also told that emergency centers near Youngstown, Ohio received many sighting reports.  A resident of Allegheny County, near Pittsburgh, had knowledge that police in that area also received reports of something moving across the sky. I also interviewed a witness from Latrobe, PA in Westmoreland County, who watched  a big orange-red ball of fire as bright as the moon followed by a glowing tail which tapered off in thickness. I am awaiting additional data concerning this event. I would appreicate being notified of any other fireball or aerial phenomena reported on this night from around the country.

An orange type fireball craft was moving slowly across the city from one end of the sky to the other.  It was growing brighter and dimmer as it went.  It eventually appeared to move up through the clouds to my left.   I suppose it could have been a Chinese lantern, but hearing so much about these orange craft on Coast, I decided to report it.;40.2917;-79.4054000000001
