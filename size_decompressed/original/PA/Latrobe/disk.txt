Object first appeared as a slow moving orange light.  I first thought it was a plane but the light was orange and not flashing.  Upon looking closer, I noticed it had a saucer type shape. It was moving slowly in a NE direction.  A tree in my yard starting obstructing my view.  In the couple seconds it took for me to move to the other side of the tree, it was gone. Also of note, there was something large moving in the woods below my house as I was watching the light.  I could hear some branches breaking and dry leaves rustling.  This could have been a bear though since I do sometimes see them around here. After seeing this, I called a friend and my cell phone was acting up.  He said it seemed like what I was saying was being repeated several times in different voices.;40.2917;-79.4054000000001
