It was definitely high in the atmosphere.  Same color/shape as a satellite, but very large compared to any I have seen before, including the ISS.  It was too slow to be a shooting star but too fast to be a satellite.  Object then stopped abruptly and hovered in place for roughly 5-7 seconds before blinking then rapidly accelerating away.  About 3 seconds after it disappeared an aircraft flew the same exact route as the light as if it was following it.;40.2917;-79.4054000000001
