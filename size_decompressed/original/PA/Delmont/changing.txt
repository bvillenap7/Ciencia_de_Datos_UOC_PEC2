I was on my top deck, when I noticed one of my chickens looking oddly straight into the sky. After quickly realizing where the chicken was looking up towards at. I saw a flying object at first, I thought it was a balloon in the sky. However, I noticed the object moving like a rolling motion and noticed triangle and squares shaped interchanging. After, confirming it was not a balloon it all of a sudden vanished. The object seemed to be a gray or black in color.;40.4105;-79.5763
