Two rapidly moving red lights over Bristol, PA.;2015-01-17 19:55:00;10-15 seconds;Two rapidly moving red lights over Bristol, PA. An observation of two rapidly moving steady red lights moving from west to east.   An approximate calculation determined that the lights traveled 125 degrees, 70 nautical miles in 10 to 15 seconds. The objects made no sound, and moved completely parallel to each other for the entire distance.   They also left no trails.;40.1137;-74.8599
Bright red light over Bristol area defies physics.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-22 23:30:00;~5 minutes;Bright red light over Bristol area defies physics. After arriving home and parking my car in the driveway, I looked up at the shot in the direction of the Burlington Bristol bridge, and saw a very bright red ball of light, stationary.  After about 10 seconds it started to move horizontally to the left, at which time I pointed it out to my friend with me.  We both watched it then completely change direction and move right in the complete opposite direction.  Silently.  It moved behind some trees and we lost it.  I called my father outside to see it, at which time it was not visible.  It then came back into sight, completely stationary, directly in front of us, in the direction of FDR middle school.  It had moved and covered some distance to arrive at this point.  So now, all three of us watch this bright red object double in brightness, as though the initial red light had a twin attached to it.  It then turned back down to normal brightness, as though there was only one red light again.   After it became less bright, it then moved left and right, straight up and back down, moving in ways that defy our technology today.  It then moved to the right, slowly, almost out of view behind the FDR gymnasium and the light began to fade as it moved.  Another second or two passed and the object disappeared from view and we didnâ€™t see it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
