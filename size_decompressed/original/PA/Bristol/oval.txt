Stepped out after the ball dropped to see some of the local street fireworks.  Except for the distant sounds, it was pretty quiet.  As I turned to go back inside,  I saw clusters of  seven to nine orange-red in color lights all at the same speed and height. There were several of theses clusters, but separated  a quarter of a mile apart.  They were followed by slower moving individuals, following each other one by one in a straight line.  I rushed inside to get my binoculars, shouting for my wife to come out with me, and I was able to see some kind of orb like thing with a brighter center. We both were pretty frantic at this point because they kept coming and coming.  Lasted for about five to seven minutes.  I’m going to contact the local police to see if there were other observers that called in, and what they might think it is. I thought if might be those Chinese candle bags that can float across the sky, but the candles couldn’t generate enough heat to float the bags because it was so cold.  No sound, just passing by.  Besides, they were going too fast.  I’m at a loss.;40.1137;-74.8599
