Venus disappeared, but was UFO.;2012-05-03 00:30:00;28 seconds;Venus disappeared, but was UFO. Approx. 12:30 AM I looked into the sky and noted that what I thought was Venus was exceptionally bright, but then it disappeared.  Within seconds there was a swirling blue and pink lighting as seen through the woods in back of my house.  I entered the house to get my camera but when I returned, the lights were gone.   I decided to try to fix the locations of the stars near where I saw the Venus light and shot some video in the general direction, just in case anyone else saw what I did.  I doubt that they did because of the hour and although the lights from Philadelphia are in the direction of what I saw, the swirling lights appeared to be located just behind and to the left of my house and so if no one else was looking, they wouldn't have seen anything. I did not see anything through the lens---android phone--but when I looked at the video, this is what I saw: oops---doesn't look like I can paste the video---what now??;40.1137;-74.8599
