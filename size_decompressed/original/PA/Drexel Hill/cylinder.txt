I was 12 years old when I snuck out of my house and went to a local park. as I walked to the park I witnessed a very large bright craft slowly descending from a cloud. Scared out of my wits and sweaty, I hid behind a log parking barrier.  The craft discharged an orange beam to the area where I was hiding.  Hitting the top of one of the logs I ran away fast as I could. The next morning I went back to where I hid and found a large burn mark on the top of the log were the orange beam struck.;39.9526;-75.2937
