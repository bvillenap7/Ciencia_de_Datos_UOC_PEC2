Two spots in the sky did not move for several minutes, seen from a moving vehicle.;2014-12-30 16:00:00;10 minutes;Two spots in the sky did not move for several minutes, seen from a moving vehicle. Driving back to the office I noticed two spots in the sky.  It wasn't until I was stopped in traffic that I realized that they had not moved.  I brought it to my associate's attention and he said he noticed the same thing. The sun was setting to the left of them. They were circular in shape. They had a glow to them much like clouds would with the sun behind them. There were no clouds in the area. They were vertically straight and did not move apart or closer. They were too big to be stars but much smaller than the sun and moon. The objects did not appear to move for the 4 minutes we drovein that direction.  After making a turn and losing sight in some trees, we could not locate them again. Nobody else I talked to saw anything.;39.9526;-75.2937
