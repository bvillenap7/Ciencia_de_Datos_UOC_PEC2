Orange orb spotted in Ridgway, Pa.;2014-06-28 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Orange orb spotted in Ridgway, Pa I watched an orange orb in the sky, traveling slowly north toward Johnsonburg from downtown Ridgway, Pa.   Object was not blinking, was not moving erratically, and bobbled slightly.   Got in my car to get gas, travelled in the same direction as the orb and it was no longer visible in under a minute's time.;41.3657;-78.7242
Orange orb spotted in Ridgway, Pa with color change due to nearby fireworks.;2014-07-04 22:30:00;2 minutes;Orange orb spotted in Ridgway, Pa with color change due to nearby fireworks. Observed a similar orb as on 6/28/14, this time traveling from west to south from the west end of Ridgway, Pa.   Orb moved smoothly at quick but not fast pace for a couple minutes.  Orb was orange in color, the same as the one seen by me a few days earlier.   As orb passed through neighborhood 4th of July celebrations, fireworks went off in the sky from a house down the street.   Right after this happened, the orb changed color from orange to dark red.  At this time, also saw a tiny white orb accompanying it, but not attached.   Tiny white orb was flying erratically and close to main (orange to dark red) orb.   Lost sight after a tree blocked our view.;41.3657;-78.7242
