It was a helicopter following case.;1998-05-21 13:00:00;2 minutes;It was a helicopter following case. I was coming back from a trip when we stoped for a restroom break, i was done first, so I went out to get a soda, then i heared a slight hum, and I looked towards the ajacent hill, where a saucer flew bye, followed shortly by 3 black double rotoered helicopters, the one leeding had USA ARMY in white on the one side.  My aunt came out and she said, What's the whirring sound? I told her what I saw, and she just said oh, and forgott about it, as though I made it up, I've not repeated this until I found your site, I thought finnally someone would accutually listen to what I had to say.;41.3657;-78.7242
