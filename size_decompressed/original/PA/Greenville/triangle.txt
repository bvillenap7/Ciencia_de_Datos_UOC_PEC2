Craft was triangular in shape.;1979-09-01 20:00:00;45 mins.;Craft was triangular in shape. craft was black with no reflection of light off of it, about 25 feet across with one red light on each side in the back. we first noticed it hovering over a water tower by a factory about 3 to 4 miles from the airport. before we reached the area it was in it headed toward the airport. We would catch up to it as it hovered over different areas such as woods, or fields only to have it take off in a different direction. Once as we watched it slowly fly above a wooded area it came to the end of the trees by a field ,it slowly tilted and followed the contour of the landscape. As it came to trees again on the other side of the field it tilted upward again. After reaching the tree tops it took off(every time it took off it was at an extremely high speed)and we had to search the area until we would spot it again. This craft made no noise at all and once when we were looking for it my husband looked in the rear view mirror and saw the glow of lights. we stopped the 8888 88;41.4121;-80.3746000000001
