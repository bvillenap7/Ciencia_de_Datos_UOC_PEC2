Triangle;2009-04-04 23:00:00;30 seconds;I was with my partner returning home from a party in New Britain, driving past the air force base on the County Line road when the field at the end of the runway lit up for a second or more. We were both shocked by the intensity of the light, but assumed it must have been some landing lights on the runway. We were both looking at the base as we drove past. My partner then pointed out that there was a 'thing' at the end of the runway. I looked and there was what looked like a helicopter sized triangle. It was hard to see because it was black/dark, but had a strip od blue light running around the rim of it. It was a couple of hundred feet off the ground at first, but then rocketed into the sky really quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
