I just happened to be looking up the sky{clear night} as I do when its clear out, I noticed i the North East a bright ball of light speeding in my direction. Its altitude was about 20,000 ft around the same as the aircraft from the local navy base. As ikt was getting closer the light got brighter and at its brightest moment it seemed to have hit somthing, like it bounced off and started goimd backwards on a 45 degree angle towards the sky as it was doing this the light started to stretch then it vanished. When I was first sall it I thought maybe it was a military plane with the landing lights but I imediately dismissed that because there was no noise, then I thought maybed it was a meteor or a shooting star again I dismissed those accounts as well because I never sall a light in the sky look like it hit somthing and bounce back in the opposite direction. The object was moving fast  dont know how fast but as quick as it came it vanished. I'm sending this now because when it happened I didnt have a comp. I hope I,m not the only one who sall this. If it was U.F.O thats fine I would like an explantion to what I have seen. I hope you fined this info usefull. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.1792;-75.1506

These light;2008-11-19 20:50:00;21:10;This is less of a craft sighting and more of a sighting a numerous beams of light varying in intensity of their brightness. These light beams, about 30-45 in number, and spanning across the perimeter of the western and north western skies, were coming straight down with no movement.  Never seen anything like this before, they were so spread out over such large area that they were not airport lights, moon light, or city lights. Cloud movement seemed to fade them out.  May still be visible as I type this.  I'm guessing, some phenomena with ice crystals or possibly the northern lights (though what I know of them it didn't seem to be these either). Any answers?
