Disc shaped object over NW Pa;2000-07-12 01:56:00;1 hour;Disc shaped object over NW Pa Co-worker called my attention to a britght light  in the sky....when I viewed the object, at first all I would see was a bright light with two lights, alternating blue and red.  When I changed my position, I could see that the white light was moving from right to left, along a trail of 6 or 8 blue lights.  WHile watching the object, I became dizzy.  I then broke my gaze and called everyone else to come and see the object.....The object stayed in the same place for about an hour, then I was unable to locate it after wards, although one coworker said He saw it overhead and It's underside......;41.4018999999999;-79.8312999999999
