missile shaped object with no wings, tail, contrail, or sound;2011-06-11 20:30:00;1 1/2 hours;missile shaped object with no wings, tail, contrail, or sound I want to preface this with the fact that I have seen this same kind of object patrolling the tree line in another area of this same town about a week before this incindent. While visiting people sitting outside,I saw this silver or white object flying rather low in a straight line over the residence I was at and I immediately pointed it out to everyone.  It looks like a missile with no wings and it makes no niose, it flies slowly through the sky in a straight line.  This particular object flew toward the treeline untill I could not see it.   About 2 minutes later the same exact thing happened! I do not think it could have been the same one because I dont think that the original object had enough time to get back around from where it started from and start over again in just 2 minutes.   We tried to get pictures of it but they are not very clear.  After this one went to the tree line again, the same thing hapened 3 more times!  The last 2 times the object was still flying in a straight line but it was focused on other areas, once it went straight across the middle of the sky untill out of sight and another time it went towards the tree line in a completely different path from the first 3 times.  Again this makes absolutely no sound, no contrail, no wings, no tail. Its as if it is a drone with no wings patrolling the area. A week before I had seen the exact same type of object patrolling the tree line near the city of Franklin, but I only saw this one make its pass once.;41.4018999999999;-79.8312999999999
