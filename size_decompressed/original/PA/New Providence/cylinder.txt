I am writing this for my mother who does not have a computer.  My mother (68) was on her way to my brothers house for a birthday dinner when she saw a strange cylinder shaped object moving down the valley toward an Amish house.  She at first thought it was an aircraft that was making an emergency landing but then it came to a complete stop and hovered near the Amish house, approx. 100 feet in the air. She watched it for several minutes in disbelief.  Then she started driving toward my brother's house, a couple hundred yards, keeping an eye on the object.  When she pulled into the driveway she turned around to look at the object and said there were what appearded to be two engines but there was no noise or lights.  It was a charcoal colored craft. Then without warning it took off at a high rate of speed, faster than a jet according to her.;39.9135;-76.2263
