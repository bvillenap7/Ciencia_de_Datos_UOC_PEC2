Explosion of a bright white very high flying Torroid shaped craft.;1998-05-17 08:10:00;40 min.;Explosion of a bright white very high flying Torroid shaped craft. Dear Sirs, Since I assume that you are the agency responsible for monitoring the airspace over North America I would like to report the following. On Sunday evening May 17, 1998 my wife and I and a friend and his wife wittnessed the explosion of what appeared to be a very high flying aircraft.  It was located in a N-NW direction from Belle Vernon, PA at about 70 degrees elevation. We watched the object, which was more of less stationary (we had no real reference), from 8:10 PM until 8:50 PM.  At that time I witnessed the object explode leaving a cloud of debris which consisted of many small fragments and one larger dark red ball which a few seconds later, split into two smaller fragments. The general apperance of the aircraft was that of a glowing torriod with the center being darker than the outside. If you have any information I would appreciate your letting me know what it was that we saw. Please feel free to E-mail me if you desire additional information regarding the event.;40.1588;-79.8122
