ball of light vanished;2010-12-29 20:19:00;5 seconds;ball of light vanished Object/light was orange & yellow mix, but blurred at the edges. It seemed to move as an aircraft would be expected to, slowly...  After about 5 seconds, it just went out or vanished. My first impression was that it went behind a cloud, but there were no clouds.  It was perfectly clear that night. There did not seem to be any other blinking lights that would indicate a plane.  I do not think it was falling space debris because it did not appear to leave a trail.;40.1588;-79.8122
