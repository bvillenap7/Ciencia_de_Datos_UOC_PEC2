It was a large silver object. The object was shaped like a circle but, the circle was flying sideways. It looked like there was windows around the object.  Also the object was flashing green lights with one red light in the middle. The object also made a loud noise thatâ€™s hard to describe.  It was kind of like a million car engines or a super loud air conditioner. It flew a little lower than a plane and was about the size of ten planes combine.
