Round UFO covered in yellow flashing lights spotted in York, PA;2006-03-23 04:20:00;20 seconds;Round UFO covered in yellow flashing lights spotted in York, PA I was asleep in the den with the cat on my lap and I was awakened by a slight ping on the windows (I live on the 4th floor of an apartment complex).  It sounded like a ping when take your fingernail to a crystal glass, or the sound of sleet when it is just starting. It woke the cat and the cat got up and stared at the window for about a minute, then jumped down and left the room (the pinging sound continued during this time).  After the cat left the room, I turned off the light and went to the window, opening the blinds.  I was just staring at the sky, when I saw this round object about the size of a small orange from my point of view.  It had yellow lights which covered the entire object, and the lights were flashing like Christmas tree lights.  I observed it for about six seconds and it was moving slowly.  It then disappeared and about five seconds later, it appeared up further in the sky.  After five seconds, it disappeared and I did not see it again.  I called the local TV station and the meterologist said there were no meterological events to report that night that would be anything like this object I spotted.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
2 unidentified objects in the sky!!!;2007-10-07 01:00:00;1 hr 30 min;2 unidentified objects in the sky!!! I went out to my balcony with a pair of my binoculars as usual to stargaze. I saw an incandescent object in the sky the approximate size of the North Star. I immediately noticed how close it was and how it seemed to be changing colors. I immediately grabbed my binoculars and viewed the object slowly moving in the sky. While viewing this sky anomaly, I noticed out of the corner of my eye another object like it but at a slightly further distance. After about 30 minutes, the 2nd object had completely vanished while the seemingly closer object remained in the sky for another 30 minutes (1 hour total) before slowly disappearing from my view. The object seemed to transition from a white color to a reddish-orange color and then to a bright blue. There were no blinking lights on the object but rather the entire circular shaped anomaly seemed to pulsate its colors. This is not the first time I have viewed something peculiar in the sky. About 3 months ago, I also viewed 2 red orbs floating above an apartment complex for about 15 minutes very close to each other. They both moved erratically like a bee buzzing around in the sky (no sound and very unlike the normal movement of an airplane or helicopter).

3 lights moving right then left very slowly.;2012-03-29 05:22:00;1 minute;3 lights moving right then left very slowly. There was 3 lights to my North moving NW to NE side ways very slow, then stoped and staryed in the same spot for about 15 sec. then moved back NE to NW then went behind the hilld.  The lights never changed spots.  So there was a one white not blinking on the left side a green blibking light in the middle and a blibking white on the right.  There is a air port near by but what I saw is bigger then any air craft i have every seen around. (lived in the same house for 10 Yrs.);39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
Bright white circular light/craft in sky shoots down to 200-300 ft above ground, hovers, than shoots back up at extremely high speed;2014-04-24 03:30:00;15 seconds;Bright white circular light/craft in sky shoots down to 200-300 ft above ground, hovers, than shoots back up at extremely high speed It was about 3:30 or 4 AM soon before I was going to go to sleep.  I have one of those green laser pointers and I thought why not go out and look at the stars for a little bit because it was one of the clearest nights it had been in a while.  To add to the darkness and clearness in the sky, one of my neighbors who always keeps his back light on happened to leave it off that night, so it was about the darkest I've ever seen it in my backyard. So I’m out on my back deck looking at the stars, shining different patterns and pointing out some constellations with the laser pointer for about 30 seconds to a minute, and all of a sudden a bright, round white light illuminates in the sky appearing to be about half the size of the moon at first.  From my position, I was looking up at it at about the 12:00 position but it was not directly above me, a little bit in front of me.  It was hard to tell how high up it was but it looked like it could have been star level.  Right when I saw it light up, it really took me by surprise and I was just thinking like what the hell is that thing. This is where the story gets hard to believe.  After the object illuminated and appeared to remain still for a second or 2, it shot down from sky in in a complete vertical line to about 200-300 ft. above the ground (about 4-5 full tree lengths based on the trees it was above in my backyard), in only a matter of seconds.  When this happened, I was in complete shock and awe and dropped my laser pointer, just standing there and staring.  The light was so bright that it almost hurt my eyes but I couldn’t look away.  It seemed to be about the size of a car but completely round.  When it shot down, it was moving at speeds much faster than any type of aircraft that I’ve ever seen.  When it came to its stopped position, the light bent a little but then went back to its circular shape.  The light was completely white and like I said almost a little bit blinding.  Also, since I was looking up at it, it seemed like I was looking at the bottom of it and didn’t have a side-view, so the c! ircular shape that I saw may have just been the underneath of the structure.  It also emitted a soft, really low frequency sound as it hovered there but there was no sound when it was coming down.  It stayed completely still and hovered for about 5 seconds.  It truly felt like as I was staring at it, it was staring right back at me.  And then all of a sudden it shot strait back up into the sky vertically in the same path at an extremely fast rate of speed about equal to how fast it came down.  But when it shot back up it reached a certain point in the sky, and then paused for a second, then shot off westward at a sharp angle and then quickly disappeared.  One of the craziest parts to me is that I don’t even live in the woods or out in the middle of nowhere.  I live in your average suburban neighborhood. Right after it happened, I went back in the house and went to bed immediately.  I thought about waking my dad up to tell him but it was really late and I was kind of trying to convince myself that I didn't really just see that.  I don’t want to tell a lot of people because I know that this story seems pretty crazy, but I know what I saw and I’m not lying.

A group of orangish circular craft are spotted.;2014-05-31 22:00:00;3 minutes;A group of orangish circular craft are spotted. On Saturday, May 31, about 10 PM, my wife and I were sitting on our deck around a fire pit.  There was a party going on at the house behind us. I got up to go inside when I looked up into the sky and saw a group of six or seven lights moving toward us from the south.  They were moving in a Northerly direction not unlike conventional aircraft.  The thing I thought was odd was their shape and color.  They were all identical circular, orange at the center with a yellowish ring around the edge with 2 very small flashing white lights opposite each other along the rim.    As the group moved across the sky it seemed one was lagging on behind and caught up with the rest of the group.  They had no sound at all.  When they met together as a group right above us, they started to disappear one at a time, which I thought was kind of odd.  It was a partly cloudy sky that night.  I could see some stars so I don’t know if they climbed and went through clouds or exactly what happened.   I don’t know what their elevation could have been.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409

As they were passing by we took notice to this very bright spot in the sky which we thought it was possibly a star or or something of that nature since it was very bright and didn't seem to be moving.   One of us grabbed the binoculars so we could get a better view during that time the other was keeping an eye on the object.  When we had the binoculars, we took notice that the object started moving but at a very slow rate.  Even with the binoculars we could not make out what this object was it appeared to be bright yellow and almost looked like a balloon or bag with a spherical shape, no lights, or identifying markers.   As we watched the object it did not seem as though it had a set path since it made a Z motion through the sky, without making any sound, or leaving any trail.   It appeared to be headed in a northern direction as it disappeared from view.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
