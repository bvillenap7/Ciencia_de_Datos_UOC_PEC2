I am an amateur astronomer who glances at the sky all of the time.  Noticed something way out of place in the south as soon as I saw it.  Not a star and definitely not a planet - checked my charts.  Way way brighter than Sirius.  Have large Nexstarr and Ultima 11-inch SCT's but could not get them out in time to set up so i observed with naked eye and a small Meade binocular.  South - One dot turning into two then three then four.  Sometimes one dot splitting into two and then back to one.  One time saw on edge appeared disk with a ring of lights.  Very far away or very big - not sure which.  Stayed staionary for well over an hour.  It is still there now at 23:02 bur further away.  One in west straight up and sort of west not as clear but seemed to split as well into two dots - see lines of light protruding out of center like an axis every once in a while.  In north thought I saw a meteor streaking but then it stopped abruptly just under Polaris.  Red hue and spinning white to red - not blinking.  Looked back at first one and when I looked back this one was gone. NO JOKE - wife saw them as well.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409

They then rotated, became one and then disappeared.  I have also taken a video of the event.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
