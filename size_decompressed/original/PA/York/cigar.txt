Observed at York International Corporation (employer) during outside breaktime.  Looked at bright blue sunny sky and saw strange occurence of several (6-12) objects (thought birds...planes...falling stars...) but then realized out of ordinary UFO's?  Objects darted in all directions up down sideways almost like a fireworks display.  Objects were very bright shiny like silver bullets or torpedos and seemed close but also way out in atmosphere.  Objects were witnessed by myself then I asked female friend to look.  By that time objects had all disappeared except four.  They came quickly did air show and then disappeared instantaneously at different intervals.  After all were gone (about 15 seconds) one object seemed to reappear vaguely and then just disappeared again.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
