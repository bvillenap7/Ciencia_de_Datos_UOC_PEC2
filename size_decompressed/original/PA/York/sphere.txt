I witnessed a glowing sphere darting across the sky and making a spiral maneuver.;2007-08-27 13:20:00;45 seconds;I witnessed a glowing sphere darting across the sky and making a spiral maneuver. I was taking a walk as I usually do at lunch. It was August 27, 2007, at approximately 1:20 PM. A large butterfly flying approximately 40 feet in the air caught my eye because of the shadow it cast on the road. While looking in that direction I spotted the very quickly moving glowing sphere.  This sphere looked to me to be about 20,000 feet and about half the size of a typical jet airliner. It had a slight glow. I tried looking at it without my sun glasses and had a very difficult time seeing it. With my sun glasses I could see it rather well.  It moved many times faster than anything I have ever seen before.  It would move then stop and hover. At one point it dropped and went into a spiral maneuver. At the end of the spiral it stopped, hovered for a few seconds, shot directly up, stopped and hovered, and then disappeared into the clouds with a tremendous speed.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
It was a chrome looking sphere about 15 feet in diameter.  ((anonymous report));2011-07-13 16:40:00;1 minute;It was a chrome looking sphere about 15 feet in diameter. I was driving home from work one day and saw a chrome sphere shaped object in the sky.  The object was directly in front of me about 175 yards away and about 40 feet above the ground just hovering.  I didn't see any lights.  It almost seem to notice that I saw it and started to slowly ascend.   Well, it seems slow at the time but it moved directly away from me so it was hard to see how fast it was actually moving.  It did seem to disappear rather quickly.  So I guess it could have ascended quickly until it was out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
