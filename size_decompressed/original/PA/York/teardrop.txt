A Redish purple teardrop shape ufo.;2008-01-08 07:38:00;1 hour;A Redish purple teardrop shape ufo. It massive, huge, amazing, and frightning. It looked like a Teardrop but redish purple color. After the first one appeared the second came. Then the third. We thought a fourth one would appear but it didn't. After a hour or so they vanished. Gone out of site. It was truly an amazing experience.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
