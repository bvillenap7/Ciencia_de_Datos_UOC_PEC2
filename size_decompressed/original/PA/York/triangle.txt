Triangle shape, large round lights entire bottom of craft with a light green haze.;2011-10-14 22:30:00;few seconds;Triangle shape, large round lights entire bottom of craft with a light green haze. It just appeared, and then dropped behind trees.  It was a distance away - it did not fly into view.  We were looking at a jet trail that looked strange and I looked to my left above the tree line - flash there it was and then it just dropped. It happened so quickly, that I questioned what i saw.  But I did see it! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
A triangular shaped object with lights was seen moving erratically at a high rate of speed above a busy highway.;2013-07-26 21:15:00;10 minutes;A triangular shaped object with lights was seen moving erratically at a high rate of speed above a busy highway. Triangular shaped object appeared on horizon at approximately 9:15 p.m. and first appeared to be a planet or bright star.  Object was seen from a moving vehicle and rapidly approached to within 600-800 feet of road before stopping to hover in air above road.  Now revealed to have 2 different colored lights (red and white) on points of triangle.  Third, greenish-colored light appeared on third point of triangle, and the lights continued to slowly alternate colors before stopping with original red and white lights.  Craft continued to move upward and to the south with erratic movements, moving approximately 2 times as fast as a commercial jet airliner.  Continued moving south over the tree line and past the horizon.  Visual contact with the object was lost at about 9:25 p.m. and was not re-established at any point afterwards.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409

I suggested it was a UFO, but it looked as if it could have been lights on a tower.   On the way back from the store we looked for it to see if it was still there and it was.  We kept our eyes on it as we drove up a hill and realized the entire triangular object started moving really fast across the sky.  The object looked slanted with a flat surface and was covered in lights.  There were a bunch of helicopters in the area as well.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409

I got off work at 12 & headed down East Market St.  I was on my way to Planet Fitness to work out.  I noticed bright lights to my left, like stadium light brightness.  I turned on Haines Road, keeping my eye on the lights. I turned onto 7th Ave & stopped before the stop sign in front of the playground & stuck my head out the window to see a huge black triangle with a bright light on each corner directly above me.  It was extremely low, barely above the trees & a house. It made absolutely no noise & was the size of a large plane.  I turned my car off to listen & heard nothing.  I looked around hoping someone else was seeing this thing but nobody was around.  I could see cars still going by on Haines Road but they didn't see it.  After 5 minutes, it began to slowly float toward Green Spring apartments & out of sight. I thought to myself, nobody would believe me & preceded to go to the gym, not once thinking anymore about it. I don't remember how much time passed.  I didn't tell my fiancee when I got home. I had forgotten it.  In fact, I didn't remember it happening until days later & I told him then.  He laughed it off but I know what I saw hovering above me. I find it convenient that my memory vanished right afterward.  Maybe I was abducted, I don't know.  When it came back to me, I couldn't believe I didn't say something about it right away!  When it did come back, it was a OMG!  Did I tell you what I saw?  Maybe they were abducting someone in the house they were over? I'm posting this now because I still think about it & wanted to share with other people without being laughed at.  My husband still can't answer me when I ask well what was it then?  No plane hovers & even if they did, it would make noise.  It wasn't a balloon & it was too big for a drone.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
