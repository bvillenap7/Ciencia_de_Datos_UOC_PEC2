Stationary grey/silver cylinder against a cloudless blue sky;1999-05-15 10:00:00;5 seconds;Stationary grey/silver cylinder against a cloudless blue sky Between 9 and 10 am on a clear May morning of 2000 I was walking my dogs along a railroad track on the west shore of the Susquehanna river. As I started to cross a wide tressle across the river I happened to look up and was suprised to see a grey/silver cylinder dead ahead at 60 degrees against the clear blue sky. The object appeared small. Its length was about 1/2 my thumb nail's width at arms length and it was about 1/2 as wide as it was long. It looked metallic but I could not discern any other distinguishing features. The sky was completely cloudless and I could see no other air traffic in the vicinity. I took about 5 careful steps while watching this stationary object which just seemed to dangle in the sky. As I was crossing a railroad tressle I was soon forced to look down to confirm my footing, and when I looked up the object was gone. I stood still looking for the object for at least a minute but saw no sign of it from horizon to horizon. As I was crossing the very wide Susquehanna there were no trees to occlude my view. The object had completely dissappeared. I am not a novice to outdoor phenomena, I hike as often as possible and watch the skys everywhere I go. My vision is better than 20/20 (uncorrected) and I am a highly sceptical individual. I am an emergency room physician by trade and in addition to my MD I also hold a PhD in pharmacology. I did not initially report this sighting as I felt very confident that I would be able to find a 'down to earth' explaination very soon. However time has passed and 1 and 1/2 years later I am still as puzzled as ever. Has anyone else experienced similar phenomena? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness corrected time and date to 1000 hrs., 15MY99.  We have changed the time and date accordingly.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE)) Dear Mr. Davenport, my UFO sighting was posted on 1/28/01. I realise that I made an error which could detract from its credibility. The sighting occurred on 5/15/99, not 5/15/00. Also it occurred at 1000, not 2200. I realise you are a very busy man and may not be able to change this but I thought I should notify you anywayâ€¦ ((END));39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
cylindrical craft with faint lights on both ends zig zags through sky over york, pa, speeding off and disappearing.;2002-07-30 00:04:00;one minute;cylindrical craft with faint lights on both ends zig zags through sky over york, pa, speeding off and disappearing. my girlfriend and i were arriving home at my house, and she saw a shooting star, and she commented onhow it was the second one she saw with me, and that i never saw them. when we got home, i parked my car, and we got out, and walked slowly to my front door, and i stopped to look to the sky to see if there were any more shooting stars. when i looked up, i noticed 2 faint red lights crossing the sky from north to south at a speed about 3 times faster than planes usually travel. i pointed at it, thinking it was a shooting star, but then noticing that it had a cylindrical form. as i was showing my girlfriend, it zig-zagged quickly, changing direction as it did so. then it continued on its original path for a few seconds, and quickly changed direction again to a north west direction, and accelerated and vanished.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
