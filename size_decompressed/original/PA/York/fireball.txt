I was headed to the mailbox in front of my house in Shiloh, PA just NW of York when I saw a round orange object coming from S to N toward me. When it got closer it seamed to be flickering like fire.  Then is slowed and came to a stop.  I watched it for a minute or so then I called 911 and reported it. While I was talking the them it started moving in the same direction as before, then made a right turn and headed SSE away from me and faded into a cloud.  All together I could see it for 4 - 5 minutes.  I could not hear it, or tell for sure how far away or what size it was. All I know is it was either very big or it was close, because I could see it flickering. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Six objects with the appearance of an orange afterburner glow traveling in sequence and seemingly spaced evenly on same path.;2014-07-06 21:15:00;10-12 Minutes;Six objects with the appearance of an orange afterburner glow traveling in sequence and seemingly spaced evenly on same path. While skying watching from our deck, spotted a bright orange object on a northern trajectory from the south.  The rate of speed seemed to be much slower then any meteor that I've seen in the past.   As I pointed the first object out to my son and as the first object seemed to fade behind clouds to the north the second object appeared to the south.   My son stepped into the house to tell my wife what we were seeing and as he did a third object appeared.  As he returned to the deck the fouth appeared and we proceeded to watch a fifth and six object arrive.  All six objects appeared to be on an identical trajectory.  They all seemed to slow at a point when we were looking at them towards the east.  Having been in the Navy they had more of an appearance of missles inflight.   No noise, no vapor trails.  One did appear to eject a lighted objected at the end of it's run and another appear to be somewhat elongated with lights down the side.   From time spotted in the southern sky to their burn out or disappearnce to the north took about two minutes each.  I have seen objects from my deck for the past several years and one similiar sighting just about four or five days before this one.  This one appeared to come from the east.   We have continuous air traffic over our house and I these objects were not planes.  Very, very curious and hoping for some kind of explanation.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
Orange-red fireball.;2015-06-22 21:30:00;2 minutes;Orange-red fireball. I saw an orange fireball descending northeast. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) The object appeared to be the size of a what I can only describe as a huge ball of orange and red in the sky in proportion to much larger than a star but not as big as a planet from the distance it was to my back porch.   The time was approximately 9:30 pm.  I hope this helps. Thanks!  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
