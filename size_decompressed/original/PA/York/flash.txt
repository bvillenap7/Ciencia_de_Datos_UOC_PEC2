MY wife and I were driving home on the highway and we both saw at the same time these red and green speeding things that travelled parallel with the car, passed us, and disappeared into the ground where we could see they were not there. What was this , and where did they go? It was not a plane or anything like that. These lights were within 100 feet of us. We both saw this and were both equally freaked out. WE were travelling north on interstate 83 in york pa.They were on the west side travelling north. They travelled with us for a brief second, right beside us. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.
