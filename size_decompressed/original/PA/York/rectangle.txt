Rectangular UFO being followed by military B52 aircraft.;2008-06-15 16:30:00;10 sec.;Rectangular UFO being followed by military B52 aircraft. June 15, 2008  UFO Report   Around 16:30 hours while lying in the shade near our pool and looking up at a CAVU sky I observed a silver/white rectangular shape at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet.  The rectangle was emitting two rather short jet trails which came from the rear two corners of the rectangle. There was a soft jet exhaust sound.  The speed was comparable to that of a commercial jet- liner...and the shape was clearly rectangular with a L/W ratio of about 6 to 8.  There were no wings visible and there was no frontal streamlining.  The shape of the bottom was truly rectangular.  Its course was south by south-west. I watched the shape cross the open sky for about 7 seconds until it passed behind the tree tops.  In doing so there were bright glints of sunlight bouncing off part of the surface.  It looked like there were only some small surfaces or points on the structure that reflected the light...as the entire shape was not reflecting light at that time.  I then lost sight of the craft. Approximately 5 to 7 seconds after I lost visual with the craft...there appeared a military type jet which was following the rectangular craft.  This was a B52 type craft emitting four jet trails of more usual length.  The engines were mounted out on the wings as the jet trails did not come from the rear of the fuselage as in civilian craft.  The wings and horizontal tail surfaces were clearly visible and were of the standard rear sweeping design.  The wing span of the military jet was approximately three times the width of the rectangular craft...and I would estimate that they were at the same altitude. As for the observer...I am white male, age 55, a licensed private pilot, with current medical that does not require corrective lenses.  I am a mechanical engineer by profession.  I do not take any medications, and alcohol was not an issue.  I am in great health, have never had any mental issues...nor have I ever sighted/reported anything like this before.
