Photographic Evidence of Small, Black, Anomalous Formation moving away from direction of wind;2002-12-19 16:15:00;16 seconds;Photographic Evidence of Small, Black, Anomalous Formation moving away from direction of wind On December nineteenth, 2002, a little after four p.m., while driving in the southern portion of York, Pennsylvania, my wife and I spotted an unusual looking small (thirty meters wide and two meters in height) black cloud in the Northeastern sky. When we first noticed the cloud, it looked to be only a hundred meters off the ground and less than one hundred fifty meters from our position, in the car. I stopped the car and got out of the vehicle to take a photo of whatever the black object was and by the time I snapped the photo (twelve seconds after our initial look at the thing) the black anomaly was approximately four hundred meters away. I then re-entered the car and looked to see where this black object had gone. It was nowhere to be seen! (Only six seconds had elapsed since I had taken the photo.) It really didn't look like a real cloud, at all. It looked more like a beginner's attempt at making a digital cloud. It moved toward the Northeast, even though the direction a nearby flag was blowing indicated that the surface wind was moving in a straight West to East direction. That was also the direction a line of upper (white) clouds were moving. Besides the small, black, cloud-like formation there were no other clouds in the sky except for the line of clouds that occupied an elevated height. The black mystery object was the only one of its kind in the sky. There were no planes or weather balloons or helicopters in the sky. The sun was near to its time of setting. Other than the above-mentioned clouds, the sky was blue. I'm not sure what else to tell you about this incident except that my wife had seen a nearly identical small, black, cloud-like formation just the day before. We still haven't gotten the film developed. Are there any special instructions on where or how this film should be developed? Also, any suggestions on which web sites would wish to be informed of this event? Hope to hear from you soon.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
I saw 5 lights in a row close together, stationery but moved backwards over the course of 2 hrs, high in the sky. ((Venus??));2004-08-08 04:30:00;2 hours;I saw 5 lights in a row close together, stationery but moved backwards over the course of 2 hrs, high in the sky. At 4:30 am today, I got out of bed to get some water in the kitchen. Looking through the window, I noticed a very bright light high up in the south eastern sky, much larger and brighter than any star or planet. You can imagine my surprise upon finding our binoculars and looking through them, what I saw off in the distance was 5 lights in a horizontal plane very close to one another, totally stationery. I got my wife out of bed. By the time she came to the kitchen, which was only a few mins, it had moved further away and at a slightly different angle, making it impossible to see it as 5 lights. Rather, by this time it was just one bright light.  I called 911 and 3 policemen came to the house. They saw the light in the sky, which I photographed by the time they arrived. Again, it had moved further away but was still clearly visible. They had never seen anything like it and made out a report. They got me your tel number in Seattle for reporting UFO's.

Strange glows appeared in sky, moving about in realativly close range.;2004-12-03 02:37:00;10 - 15 minutes;Strange glows appeared in sky, moving about in realativly close range. We were in Rocky Ridge Park late in the morning, around 2:30 am. We were going camping for the last time this year, before it gets real cold. We had a camp fire going and we had been getting ready to put it out when we decided to just let it burn itself out instead. One of the three of us commented on how clear it was for once, since it had been overcast for the last few days. We then started picking out the names of constalations that we were able to point out. Thats when we saw what we think was a UFO. There was a slight haze or light glow around the object. At first it seemed more like a distand planet but after a while we noticed it was more than that. It was actually moving, slowly moving but moving. The first thing that came to mind was that it was a plane, except planes dont just stay around one spot. Then we thought about a helicopter or something of that sort, but there is no reason a chopper should be floating arount there, nor did it really look like one. It was hard to tell the shape of the object be cause the glow caused the object to look blurred. We discussed our new topic of intrest for a while, wondering what it could be. We had gotten away from gazing dumbfoundedly at it for a while only to look back and notice a second glow. At first it seemed unreal, but after the two moved in diffrent patterns and stayed relatively close, we knew it wasnt anything normal. We decided that we would go on with our night as we planned but the happening stayed in the back of our minds all night. We didnt watch them until they went away but the time that we did spend watching them lasted about 10 to fifteen minutes, not including the time spent discussing the objects between the time the first one and second one appeared.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
three non-moving, orange,  pulsating objects form triangle over night sky then disappear one at a time.;2010-10-09 21:40:00;20 mins;three non-moving, orange,  pulsating objects form triangle over night sky then disappear one at a time. long story short, at about 9:30pm, sitting on my back porch, my girl and i saw an orange pulsating light way bigger than any plane light in the sky come from a distance moving slowly from right to left then suddenly stopped moving and sat still for a few minutes pulsating then went out suddenly as it appeared. i stayed outside curious to see if i could see anything else and about ten minutes (properties on my cell video state it was 9:40pm) later two of the same objects, within two seconds of one another, just suddenly appeared from out of no where in the same area that the first one was seen. i ran inside to get everyone and my cell phone to try to record it and when i came back outside the two objects were still there pulsating and stationary. then we saw a third object of same color shape and size coming from south to north and the three, together, formed a perfectly shaped triangle. they stayed that way for a minute, then rotated so the point was no long! er on the bottom but the top now. then they went out suddenly one at a time in the same order that they each appeared. i still have the video but unfortunately my cell phone is not good at night so i can only see black mainly and hear myself talking on it.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
Six orange lights flew in formation across the sky.;2013-01-01 00:15:00;~5 minutes;Six orange lights flew in formation across the sky We saw an orange light come up over the horizon very close in proximity to a red flashing marker light at the top of a tower.  At first it appeared to be three lights, two orange with a white one in the middle.  As the lights moved very slowly across the sky, they coalesced into one orange light. My one son and I saw this one.  I moved to the window and watched it.  I told him it was a helicopter, but I knew that it wasn’t.  When it got across the street, the light went out.  Whatever it was, it did not fly-off or anything, it just disappeared. I didn’t really think that much about it until we saw the second one follow the same trajectory.  This time we opened the windows and listened for the sound.  I called my other two kids into the room to see it as well.  There was no sound.  None at all. As we were standing there, three of them came up on the horizon in approximately the same location.  They flew in a triangular formation along the same path.  Halfway across the sky, the light in the rear, flew off at a rapid pace 90 degrees from the original path.  This one flew away from the house, as opposed to the other two that were flying along the back side of the house.  I got my binoculars out, and thankfully, the city lights illuminated the sky as a backdrop.  I was able to see the formation of something ahead of the orange light.  It appeared to be some type of triangular shape, but I couldn’t see it any clearer than that.   I followed it across the street, and again the light went off, but I could still see the shape of the thing moving across the sky.  My binoculars are not very powerful, but I watched it as long as I could.  It continued in the same direction until I could no longer see it. A sixth one did the same thing a few minutes later.  I have no idea what they were, but they were not helicopters nor were they airplanes.  They looked like nothing that I have ever seen before. About fifteen minutes later, there was a series of about three helicopters circling the area.  I do not know if they were related. When I first saw it, I thought that the orange light was the afterburner of a jet.  The object was moving too slowly to have been a jet with an afterburner, and when I got a closer look with my binoculars, I could tell that the orange was some kind of light.  It was not produced by burning of fuel.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409

I seen two sets of flashing red and white lights coming towards each other.   ((anonymous report));2016-08-11 22:00:00;5 minutes;I was standing outside my home, watching the sky. I seen two sets of flashing red and white lights coming towards each other.  I thought they where going to crash.   Then a helicopter like craft appeared about 10 feet in front of me.  I yelled for my fiance, but as soon as I did, boom it was gone.  I know what I saw.   Also, from a distance there was a flashing white light that lite the sky up, while many flashing red and white light crafts where flying in the sky.   I have no clue what was going on, but I have never seen something like this before.  It was incredible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

It had 3 red lights, and made a humming noise. It also looked as if it was traveling the opposite way a helicopter would. Startled I proceeded to go home and people in nearby cars seen it as well;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
