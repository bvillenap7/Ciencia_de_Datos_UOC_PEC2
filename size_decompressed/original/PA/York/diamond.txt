Diamond formation of four stationary lights between Saturn and Jupiter;2019-06-13 23:00:00;30 seconds;Diamond formation of four stationary lights between Saturn and Jupiter Saturn E-SE approximately 7.7/127.0 degrees Alt/Az, Jupiter E-SE 23 degrees above horizon, 23.0/153.9 Alt/Az up and right of very bright Saturn.  Sky observed at 22:30 normal, except brightness as noted.  Sudden appearance of diamond configuration of four (4) lights mid-point between two planets, stationary for 20 seconds of observation, then began sequentially fading out in place.  Duration was no more than 30 seconds.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
