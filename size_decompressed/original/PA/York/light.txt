A object following our van;2003-11-26 06:10:00;10 minutes;A object following our van I was sitting at my door waiting for my school van to pick me up and I saw a flashing light in the sky. at first iI thought nothing of it but when I looked up at it a few minutes later it was still there. when I looked at it through a pair of binoculars there was one white likig and different colored flashing lights on the bottom of it. My van came and when we moved the light seemed to be moving with us and stop with us I could not tell a distance at all but I am prety sure it was below the cloud level and was not a star when we got on the highway it seemed to be moving away (I saw it through the tree branches) I lost it behind a hill for a few seconds and it dissapeared. after it left ihe vans engine was cutting out going up hills sometines and other times it was just fine and when I got off it was still doing this.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
Four red lights dancing around heading due west.;2004-02-28 03:45:00;Aprox. 2 minutes;Four red lights dancing around heading due west. Around 3:45 in the morning. a sunday.  I was about to turn around and go to my bed when I saw a blurbed little red light pop on near Jupiter.  It was originally heading south, but it turned west from its course by large swoop-like turns, like a ball on a string.  After the first light had caught my attention, three more came out of the east, at a steady speed in a loose echeleon formation.  Two were flying straight and rigid, while the one farthest south was swerving around like a bouncy ball.  While they were as close to being directly above me as they ever came to be, an incredibly bright meteor, short, extremely fast.  It did NOT effect the craft in formation. About fifteen minutes afterwards, I saw a another strange looking meteor, the reason I say it looked strange is because it looked extremely low, like a trace bullet. The red lights had no particular shape, just little red blurbs of light.  I am known to be a mostly honest person.  With only one witness, that being me, this probably doesn't count all that much.  But I knew what I saw and it scared me plenty. I also saw the first one throght binoculars, so I knew I wasn't seeing things, and I wasn't dreaming either.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
Bright shiny object that suddenly disappeared.;2009-04-17 06:30:00;half an hour;Bright, shiny object that suddenly disappeared. While sitting in my car in my work place parking lot, I looked up into the sky and saw 3 trails shooting straight up into the air from what was normal aircraft.   While watching this I noticed just above theses planes was a brightly shining object.  I watched for about 2 minutes and the blinking object then diasappeared.   Immediately following this, one of the planes took off and the other two soon followed. I took some pictures with my iPhone, while doing that several other aircraft appeared from different angles, and quickly took off in the same direction.   In the next 15 minutes of this occurrence, i witnessed along with one of my co-workers approximately 10 more planes coming from the distance and just appearing.  They all seemed to head in the same direction.  I've never seen anything like this, and was hoping that maybe someone else had reported the same thing, or if I could get some kind of clarification.  I called my fiance almost right after the incident just to see if there was anything on the news, but apparently not.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
3 balls of light rising and disappearing.;2014-09-03 21:00:00;15 minutes;3 balls of light rising and disappearing. My mother, sister and I saw two red and orange balls of light in the sky staying still.   After about 3 minutes, one of them began to fade away, then 5 minutes later, the second one faded away.  After about 5 more minuts we witnessed a bigger ball of light rising along the horizon then fade after a few more minutes.  While witnessing the lights, my sister and I experienced intense headaches.  Also, our two cats were scared and stand-offish.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
Multiple silent orange lights seemingly coming from the south, flying a bit to north, and then off to the east.;2015-07-02 23:00:00;20 minutes;Multiple silent orange lights seemingly coming from the south, flying a bit to north, and then off to the east. Initially, saw two orangish lights (about the color of the orange street lights) completely silent flying one on top of the other seeming in parallel just slightly above the treetops eventually going higher and then of to the east disappearing into the clouds.   Then another two came up from the south and again appeared to be flying in some loose formation one above the other.   Then there was a bit of a break then single lights would appear on the southern horizon and appear to heard slightly to north and then east and disappear into the clouds.   This continued on for a while the timing of each was not identical sometimes a longer lull in between the lights and other times they seemed to come almost two at a time.   But the travel of each from the south slightly north and then off to the east stayed the same.  This continued on till around 23:30.;39.9632348148148;-76.7165807407409
