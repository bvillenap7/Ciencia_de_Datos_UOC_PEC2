While gazing into the sky looking at the constellation Casseopia, I noticed what first looked like an airplane very, very high in the sky. While I was watching, 3 or 4 similar objects flew in from different compass points to join the first, they then seem to form up and flew west and disappeared. It was difficult to see any lights as they moved quickly, but a red light on the first craft might have been visible, although very dim.;40.2211;-75.2284
