I saw an unblinking bright red light in the southwest sky which disappeared. I went out to look for Mars during the dates it was closest to Earth. My sense of direction is bad, but I saw a VERY bright red light in the sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon. I had read that Mars is unlike a star in that it is a constant light,unblinking as stars do. Then I realized that I was looking in the southwest sky and that is not where Mars should be. I continued to look at the red light for at least 2-3 minutes when it blinked out. No movement, no diminishing, just gone. Seconds after that, a blinking light starting at the point the light disappeared and traveling in a straight line from south to north at a high altitude passed over. The light seemed to be red in the center with blue and white lights circling around the red center.I watched it until I couldn't see it any longer. I have since observed passing planes and satellites in the sky. This was definely different. I found this web site while looking for articles for a college class. When I saw a similar incident in Pennsylvania, I felt vindicated and made this report. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.2211;-75.2284
