I was heading North bound onto 309 when a bright light appeared in the sky to the West.  The light was bright white, no color at all. It was bigger then any aircraft I have ever seen by 10 times at least.  If an airplane was a quarter, the light I saw was about the size of a lid from a quart of paint.  The shape was not round nor square, but seemed to change slightly back and forth, as I watched.  The road did not have a turnout to pull over safely so I drove on.  As I watched the light it followed my pace for about 3/4 mile and then slowly headed north east over my head and out of sight.;40.2211;-75.2284
