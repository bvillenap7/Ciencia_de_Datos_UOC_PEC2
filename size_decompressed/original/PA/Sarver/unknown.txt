I'm hoping someone can tell me about this one:  standing outside with a friend originally facing north watching all these strange objects, i turned around (facing South/southwest) to walk back inside.   I didn't even have to glance up to see 4 bright orange lights spaced evenly apart in a horizontal line traveling slowly and steadily in a south/sw direction.  I should have seen them prior to my turning around, according to the direction in which they were flying.  If it was one object, it was bigger than any plane I've ever seen, and didn't seem to be as high as planes normally fly at night, or as fast.   I ran in to get a camera and when I came back out my friend who was with me said he saw a bright red light shoot out the back at a much higher speed in a north/nw direction.  This red object was blinking and traveling much faster than a  plane (which I was trying ! to convince him it was).  It either got too far away to see, lost in clouds, or disappeared.  We lost visuals on the original 4 lights over a tree line.  There were no sounds from either the blinking red or orange lights.  I just want a logical explanation! Thank you!;40.719;-79.7485
