7/17/2003, 3 AM, Columbia, PA, 40 minutes duration, blue saucer shaped craft hovered for 20 minutes.;2003-07-17 03:00:00;40 minutes;7/17/2003, 3 AM, Columbia, PA, 40 minutes duration, blue saucer shaped craft hovered for 20 minutes. Observed by a 53-year-old nurse at 3 AM until 3:40 AM.  It was a metallic blue, saucer shaped craft with about 6 very large rectangular windows.  White beams of light fell from all the windows but one, which had either a blue or red beam.   I followed one beam with my eyes and it fell about 3 yards short of the grass in my back yard.  It hovered over my yard and my 2 neighbor's yards for approximately 20 minutes. Made absolutely NO sound. Traveled at enormous speed like no earthly craft that I am aware of. When it flew away, it turned into darting, flickering white lights (as I first observed it before the craft came close enough to take shape) It went south and then made a u-turn in the sky and went west where it stopped in the sky. Had I not seen it do what it just did, I would have thought I was looking at a star. I watched for a while but it didn't move and I had to go to work in the AM.

It was very early morning, but still dark and I saw a disk shaped craft with rectangle-shaped white and yellow lights (I think they were the colors) going rather slowly from west to east at a very low altitude. I watched it fly away until it went out of sight. It was heading toward Lancaster, PA.  By now, July is UFO month at my house as I've had sightings the past three Julys!!!  And one in September!;40.0402;-76.4855
