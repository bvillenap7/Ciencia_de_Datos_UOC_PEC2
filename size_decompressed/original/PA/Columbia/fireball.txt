Three of the fire balls were in a triangle formation.  The other three were scattered in front of the three that were shapped as in triangle formation.  Absolutely no noise from any of the fire balls.  They kept flying towards us in the sky then they just disappeared.  Fifteen seconds later two more appeared.  Then disappeared.  Ten seconds later two more appeared.  Then disappeared. Seconds later, above the clouds there was a series of white flashes in the sky.  Almost would remind you of a lighting storm in the distance, but it was not a lighting storm happening no where in this area.  I have video.;40.0402;-76.4855
