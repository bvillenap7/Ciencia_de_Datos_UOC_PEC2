Observed by a 54-year-old nurse from her bathroom window.  I looked out my window and saw the same flickering, darting white lights going at tremendous speed - the same lights I saw LAST July around this time. I exclaimed out loud, Oh my God, they are back! They never came close enough for me to see their shape and they went out of sight within a minute or two. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
