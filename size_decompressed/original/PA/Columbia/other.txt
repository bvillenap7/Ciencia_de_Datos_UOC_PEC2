The two bright lights were side by side about a degree and a half apart.  They were too bright to be part of the constellation Cassiopeia which was rising in the eastern sky.  I'm an amateur astronomer and noticed them as out of the ordinary.   They were motionless and after about 45 second's they just faded out at the same rate.  Brighter than Venus and a bit larger in size.  They were on the left side of the constellation.  The time was between 20:30 and 21:00 hrs.;40.0402;-76.4855
