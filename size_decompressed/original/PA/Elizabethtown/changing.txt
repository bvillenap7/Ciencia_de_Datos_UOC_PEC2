4 bright white lights seen in a line formation, object (lights) went from horizontal orientation to completely perpendicular formation.;2015-01-15 21:30:00;20 minutes;4 bright white lights seen in a line formation, object (lights) went from horizontal orientation to completely perpendicular formation. Object seen while traveling on 83 heading toward 743 in the Elizabethtown area.  While hovering the object had 4 very bright distinct (round) lights situated in a perfectly straight line formation quite close together, the object moved from a horizontal orientation to completely perpendicular orientation to the ground and hovered like that for a brief time before the lights faded away.   Two witnesses observed object for about 15-20 minutes while traveling in which the object traveled in a wide circle formation seen in the sky at a distance in front of vehicle, then moved to the right, then behind, and so forth all while maintaining about the same altitude and distance.   When the object was moving the 4 bright lights dimmed and were seemingly orientated in a more triangular format than in a straight line.
