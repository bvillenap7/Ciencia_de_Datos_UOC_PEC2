Bright Oval Dissolved/Flickered in night sky;2011-05-19 10:50:00;30 seconds;Bright Oval Dissolved/Flickered in night sky Very cloudy, over-cast, raining on and off throughout the evening.  Noticed a bright oval/bell shaped light with a dim redish hue radiating from the object.  It was late at night and looked as if there was a magnificent sunset coming through the clouds.  The object/light lasted for 4 or 5 seconds and flickered/dissolved away. As it dissipated I could still see a purplish light as if I was staring at a bright light and gone it did not fly away in a particular direction it was stationary. The color of the light: oranges, reds, yellows, whites, purples (like a orange sunset with definitive edges)    My friend and I were both baffled and in shock!  We both described the same thing back to each other to make sure we saw the same thing, our descriptions were exact.  A plane flew by minutes later and it was 1/30th the size and much higher in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
