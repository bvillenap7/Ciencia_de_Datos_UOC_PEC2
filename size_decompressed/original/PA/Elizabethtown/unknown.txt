Extremely bright light north of Elizabethtown, PA.;2013-07-06 22:55:00;15 seconds;Extremely bright light north of Elizabethtown, PA Upon looking into the sky I observed an extremely bright light, it appeared to be moving from west to east at an unknown but slow rate of speed.   At first I thought it was a star but it began to emit an extremely bright white light.  It slowly light up becoming the brightest light in the sky and then disappeared.   I continued looking into its direction for a few minutes for blinking lights like that of a plain turning around but there was nothing.   I live near MDT an am very use to all types of aircraft.   This was not a firework either.  The height of the object seemed as high as the constellation of the Big Dipper at the time of the incident.;40.1551;-76.6021
