V-shaped, fast moving set of lights above the clouds.;2016-10-21 22:15:00;10 minutes;V shaped, fast moving set of lights above the clouds. While driving on south Market past the Lumberyard, I noticed a light passing through the clouds on my left.  At first I thought it was the moon, until it jetted across the street and settled above the lumberyard.  Through breaks in the clouds I could see obvious forward lights and a v shaped pattern of lights on the undercarriage.
