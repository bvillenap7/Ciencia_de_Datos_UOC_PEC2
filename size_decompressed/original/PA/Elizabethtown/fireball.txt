I believe the sighting over Elizabethtown, PA, was a single Chinese lantern.;2016-10-10 19:17:00;4 minutes;Not trying to debunk a sighting, and I'm not a expert, but I believe the sighting over Elizabethtown, PA, was a single Chinese lantern.   I haven't determined who launched the lantern, but it was flying low, so I assume from Elizabethtown.  My guess is the college.

Single slow moving fireball that changed direction.;2016-10-10 19:17:00;4 minutes;A single slow moving fireball that changed direction. I noticed a bright orange glow towards the east.  Kept an eye on it for a minute then decided to use my video on my phone.  I did capture a little, but my dog was pulling me around.   It was only one object which traveled towards me then seem to arc around and head north east.  It was slow moving and made no noise.   If someone knows anyone at ATC at Harrisburg International.  Have them check the radar at that time.  I'm within 10 miles of HIA.;40.1551;-76.6021
