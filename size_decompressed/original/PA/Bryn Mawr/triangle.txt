I went out on my roof to star gaze for a few minuets before going to sleep the sky was pretty cloudy with a fair amount of light polution, but a few stars were still visible. Near Polaris, a hazy but distinct yellow glow appeared.  The light was in a rectangular shape, and the triangular object appeared from the left of the auroa and moved to the center.  The Triangle shape had flat edges (as opposed to corners) with a circular space in the center.  The circular center was a darkish color (as were the 'flat edged corners') but the space between the center and the corners were brightly lit in a yellowish white light. The object darted to the right of the rectangular aura, and only after the ship completly passed through this aura, did the light disappear.;40.0271;-75.3291
