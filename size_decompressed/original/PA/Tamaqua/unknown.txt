A warm front came by the Area and my wife noticed a dark green perfect circle about 15 feet in diameter and a cross section of about 1 and 1/2 feet thick.  I was coming down from the second floor steps and noticed the circle she was talking about.   I proceeded down the yard and started to take pictures and was amazed of the size and the dark green color compared to the rest of the other grass was brown and dead color.  It is every noticable you could miss the  contrast difference and a perfect circle. ((NUFORC Note:  We are awaiting the photo.
