SMALL WHITE CRAFT SEEN DURING THE DAYTIME.;1999-06-15 13:00:00;5 minutes;SMALL WHITE CRAFT SEEN DURING THE DAYTIME. MYSELF AND MY CHILDREN SEEN 3 TOP LIKE CRAFT HOVERING ABOVE OUR BACK YARD. THERE WAS NO NOISE BEING MADE THEY APPEARED TO BE SPACE SHUTTLE WHITE IN COLOR. AND THEY APPEARED TO BE SMALL IN SIZE. THEN THE CRAFT JUST ZIPPED AWAY IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. I HAVE BEEN A NON BELEIVER UNTIL THIS INCIDENT AND PREVIOUS INCIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. I AM A PROFESSIONAL ((deleted-- public employee)). I SERVED IN THE ((deleted--military service)). I AM OF SOUND MIND. MY CHILDREN ARE ALSO OF SOUND MIND AND HONOR STUDENTS IN SCHOOL. SINCE 1998 OUR COMMUNITY HAS HAD NUMEROUS SIGHTING OF GREEN LIGHTS FLYING OVER OUR TOWN FROM A LARGE CRAFT. REPORTS WERE CALLED INTO THE COMMUNICATIONS CENTER AND LOCAL POLICE WERE NOTIFIED AND THEIR COMMENT WAS WE SEE IT AND  WANT DO YOU WANT US TO DO ABOUT IT. THEIR WAS EVEN NEWSPAPER ARTICLES WRITTEN ABOUT THE INCIDENTS. SOMETHING IS GOING ON BECAUSE THE CRAFTS HAVE BEEN COMING EVERY SUMMER. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1999 is approximate.  We have requested reports from the children, as well, and have invited the witness to submit reports of the other events he alludes to above.  He holds a position of considerable responsibility in his community.  PD));40.8011;-75.9774
