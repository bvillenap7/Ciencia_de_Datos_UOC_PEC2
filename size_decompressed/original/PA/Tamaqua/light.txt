As I was walking across our backroad (we live in the country) and it was mostly black outside, I was going to our neighbors, when I noticed that the side of my neighbors house was lite up brightly and so were the pine trees that border the left side of the house, at first I thought nothing of it, but then I realized something in the sky was lighting it up.  I wirled around to see and the light instantly vanished.  There was no sound at all.  Witnesses include, myself, my aunt who lives about 3 houses away, and a friend of my neighbors who lives a few miles away. I never actually saw the craft, it vanished AS SOON AS I TURNED AROUND (like it was watching me) I got the description from my aunt. The following night, I was walking down our hallway with the lights of, just in the dark, when the whole hallway lite up bright red, then whent to a dark blood red.  At first I thought it was the tail lights to a car, but it wasn't.  I also was frozen in the position I was in.  I have told myself before if anything wierd like this happens I'll go investigate, walk around, etc, but I couldn't it was like I was frozen.  The light eventually faded out and things came back to normal.;40.8011;-75.9774
