5 bright orange shapes in sky.;2009-07-30 21:30:00;1 minute;5 bright orange shapes in sky. There were 5 shapes that were orange in color.  It was nearing dusk, but the sky was still somewhat light.  Said shapes were kind of balloon shaped, but intensely bright (almostt fluorescent).  The 5 shapes were in a pattern at first, but as they traveled through the sky they began to separate a bit and began circling one another at points.  They slowly drifted farther off in their travels and eventually disappeared.;41.3232341463414;-75.7913951219512
