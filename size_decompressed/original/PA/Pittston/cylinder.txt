Dark grey cylinder moving SW to East.;2019-05-01 13:02:00;20 seconds;Dark grey cylinder moving SW to East. From an elevated location â€“ saw a dark grey cylinder object move across the sky from a SW to E direction.  No noise heard, could not determine distance away accurately. The day was overcast.  As the object moved towards the East it became harder to see as I may have been looking at the back of the cylinder.;41.3232341463414;-75.7913951219512
