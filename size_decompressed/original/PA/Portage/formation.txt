I got home from work early in the AM and looked up at the sky.  I noticed a small cluster of white orbs which I thought were stars at first.  I noticed they would get bright then dissapear and reappear anywhere from 10-15 seconds.  They were pretty high up with in a formation that resembled and arrow. 2 in a straight line going up and 3 that formed the “arrowhead” I watched them for about 15 minutes.  They did not move far and to me it looked like the 2 that were in a straight line would hover closer then farther away from each other.  I also noticed a few shooting stars the same night.;40.3716;-78.6289
