3 oval shaped objects met in sky and hovered closely.;2020-10-07 22:45:00;5 minutes;3 oval shaped objects met in sky and hovered closely. When sitting outside at night tonight I witnessed one typical jet fly over head. The jet was recognizable and had normal noise coming from above. After the regular jet craft passed by residence, three smaller oval shaped crafts were spotted in the place of origin in the sky around where the jet first originated. They were all the same size. There was no visible trails coming from them and there was no engine noise heard throughout the entire sky. One oval had two white lights that flashed over to one red light, alternating back and forth every few seconds. The other two ovals had only one flashing white light that alternated to one red light every few seconds as well. Once the plane passed and the ovals were sighted the one with three lights flew straight up very slowly in a straight vertical line and the other two met lower in the sky towards the middle of the sky more. The oval with three flashings lights, that flew straight up then flew side ways/down to join the two lights lower down. All three of the ovals lights alternated throughout this entire period. After they were stationary in the sky for about a minute, the oval with three lights quickly flew on the path that the jet has just passed over a few minutes earlier, over the residence. The other two ovals stayed stationary for a few more seconds and then slowly drifted in the complete opposite direction.;40.6797;-80.2119
