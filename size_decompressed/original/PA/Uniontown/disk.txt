I was sitting in hot tub (So No phone to record) moon gazing when these objects appeared right in my line of vision.  They looked kind of like Small blimps With a light on the front. There were 8 of them in a figure 8 formation.  A few fallowed slightly behind. I thought it was helicopters but no sound. Then I thought drones?  Trying to rationalize what I saw , I got a little scared and almost got out, but didnâ€™t cause I wanted to see more!  A few minutes later I heard a crazy loud  rumble above me.;39.8864;-79.7249
