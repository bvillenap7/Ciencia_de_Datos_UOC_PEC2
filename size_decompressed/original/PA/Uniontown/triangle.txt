I was out watching fire works with my boyfriend, his brother, and little sister tonight and after the fire works were over I saw a very interesting object. I made a joke and said, hey look, it's a UFO. Then I looked closer and thought that maybe it really is. It was a triangular shaped object with three lights on it, and it was moving very quickly. It seemed to be in one place, then another in a matter of seconds. When I told my dad about what I saw, he didn't believe me. But i know what I saw was not just an airplane.;39.8864;-79.7249

As I slowed down to see where the light was coming from the light then seemed to turn onto my car like a spotlight and slowed down but then the object turned the lights forward towards the opposite direction I was traveling.  At this point I was able to see the shape of the object it was triangular with different colored lights on the bottom of it in the middle there was three white lights that were being used as spotlights.  I turned around to follow the object, as I did this the object turned on its side and sped away.  I tried to capture the object on film, on my phone, but my phone became out of focus and would not let me record.;39.8864;-79.7249
