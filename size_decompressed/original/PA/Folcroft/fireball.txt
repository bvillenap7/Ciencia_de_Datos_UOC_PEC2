Speeding green ball of light;2008-02-01 21:00:00;10 secs;Speeding green ball of light I was driving northbound on Oak ave in Folcroft, pa one night in February. I am not sure the extact date and I am killing myself over that right now. Folcroft is literally about 5 mins from the Philadelphia International airport. I usually see planes that are extremely close, as they are about to land. This was not plane, it wasnt even an aircraft I dont think. As I was driving a swift motion caught my eye and as I turned my head I saw a green ball of light. I cant put into perspective the actual size but I can say it would appear to be that of a basketball perhaps and it has like a green motion trail following it. As soon as I could get the words  What in the world out of my mouth it dissapeared seemingly into thin air as if it evaporated. I can remember that it was as close as the top of a tree though and about several house lengths away from me. I just found this site. I wish I could of been more help earlier. I dont know what it was that I saw but it was defintely a fast green ball that dissapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.8868;-75.2876
