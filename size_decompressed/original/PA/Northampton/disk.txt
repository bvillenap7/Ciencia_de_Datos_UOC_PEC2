As a looked around I saw 2 round shaped objects. They both had yellow,red and another color circling around them. I watched they would move back and forth across the sky in a straight line. Then they started to move up and down, somewhat like a pattern of a diamond shape. One object dropped suddenly down, then it seemed to be hovering. The other oject darted off very quickly in a V shaped pattern and the disappeared.  As the other craft was still hovering you could really see the lights. Nothing like this have I ever seen before. The object hovered lower to the ground, but didn't touch. I was NOW becoming very scared. But I stilled watched. The object still had the lights circling around the bottom and it began to move one way and the another straight line back and forth, and the made a L shaped design and up it went very fast and then disappered. I did live near a local airport and called them to see if there were any planes coming into the area. They stated NO  I am KNOW a BELIEVER!!!!!   Judi Wright  Northampton, PA;40.6986;-75.4834
