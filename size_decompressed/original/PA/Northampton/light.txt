Wave of 6 lights seemed to be at low altitude but not low enough to see a shape or the light emitted concealed the shape.  There was now sound that we could hear and they seemed to be traveling at a cruising speed and were different sizes.  The largest being the red one with kind of a haze to it.   The next largest seemed to be red, orange, and yellow but flickering kinda like it was on fire but not.  The second wave came in about 2 minutes after the first with 4 objects in the wave 2 of which seemed like duplicates of the red and the fire ball type in the first wave all seemed to be going in same direction from where I was standing North to South.   The other objects seemed just like a white light but it didn't look like normal white light one did have a tint of green.;40.6986;-75.4834
