8 spheres in formation.;2010-07-03 22:30:00;~3 minutes;8 spheres in formation My wife took the dogs out and called to me to bring out the binoculars because the stars were so predominant.  She hadn't asked this before or since.  So I did, when she screamed to me that I needed to come to the back of the yard (we have a fairly big yard).   When I got there, there were 8 spheres in the sky in formation the first 5 were red, about a third the size of my fist at arm's length.  Then a white yellow sphere about a third size larger followed by 2 more red ones.   They came in from the north-east very slowly then as a formation turned east and excelerated and and were gone in a flash..  No sound..  Through the binoculars you could see they were solid objects..  Not airplanes, nor lanterns.   Spheres were approx 40 degrees above the horizon.  Could not tell how high they were.  Not a cloud in the sky..   These things were low (a few hundred feet) or they were really big.   It changed my life..   I reported it to MUFON the same night..  The MUFON records later show these objects showed up all over the area from july 3rd to the 5th.   Thank you.;40.6986;-75.4834
