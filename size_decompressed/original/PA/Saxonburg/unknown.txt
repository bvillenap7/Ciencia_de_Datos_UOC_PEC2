On the evening dog walk I noticed red and white strobe-like lights moving slowing from north to south that were almost directly overhead. These lights were fairly close together and at first I thought it was a commercial jet on high approach to Pittsburgh Airport, but it was not heading in the usual NE to SW direction. It reminded me of a satellite because at one point the lights were jumping slightly out of the path of the object as if it might be rotating, but the distance they traveled sideways was more than 4 times the distance between them (there appeared only a slight separation)as if it might be a larger object and the lights were simply moving from one side to the other in a sideways direction. I could not see any outline, however. As I watched, the lights made a slow wide arc of about 90 degrees to the west and disappeared over some trees to the west. They were in view for quite some time through the trees and my impression was that the object was either moving very slowly or was very high. It was almost like it was floating or gliding and there was no sound coming from its direction at any time. The night was clear and the visibility was good. I had expected a green starboard wing light, but there was none.;40.7377;-79.8336
