We saw a ball of fire in the sky as we were driving and it sped away after sharply turning.;2011-11-12 22:15:00;2 minutes;We saw a ball of fire in the sky as we were driving and it sped away after sharply turning. We were driving on the interstate when and we looked up and saw a bright orange ball of fire lazily drifting in the sky above the road.  I figured it was a paper lantern that someone had let go but then all of a sudden it took a sharp turn to the right, probably about 60 degrees or so and started going a lot faster than it had previously.  We pulled off to the side of the road and I rolled down my window and shut the car off and I heard this roaring engine, completely different then how a plane, helicopter, or even jet would sound.  It was unlike anything either of us had seen before.  We turned the car around in a parking lot to get a picture of it and as soon as we got it turned around it disappeared behind clouds and didn’t reappear.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241
Ball of flames moving slowly across the night sky and witnessed by 4 people.;2013-10-13 19:40:00;2-3 minutes;Ball of flames moving slowly across the night sky and witnessed by 4 people. I was standing outside my daughter’s house at 7:40 in the evening talking with her when she looked past me and asked, “What in the world is THAT?”  I could see the shock on her face from the glow of the moon.   I turned to see what she was looking at and saw a large object that appeared to be on fire.  It was difficult to tell how high up it was, or how large it might have been, but it was about half the size of the moon at that point.   It moved very slowly and purposely, as if on some kind of course.  I couldn’t make out any vehicle, which would have been illuminated by the moon.   The fire appeared to be in the shape of a ball.  All we could see were orange and yellow flames, as if a large candle was flickering.  It couldn’t have been a hot air balloon or Chinese lantern, since the entire object was in flames.   It didn’t move along with any wind current, but instead moved in the pattern that a plane would move.  Then I thought maybe a plane was on fire, but we still couldn’t make out any specific shape under the flames.   It was totally silent – no sound of an engine of any kind.  We watched it for 2 to 3 minutes before it slowly disappeared into the night sky as a tiny speck.  It was moving from southeast to northwest and appeared to go higher in altitude the further away it got from us.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241
