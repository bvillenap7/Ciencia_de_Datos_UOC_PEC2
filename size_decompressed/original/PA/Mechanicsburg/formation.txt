Traveling home from work in suburban area (Mechanicsburg, PA). At 7:10 p.m. I witnessed several (5-7) bright amber colored lights traveling in an easterly direction.  The lights were in a straight formation.  At first I thought they were lights on a new antenna or something until I realized they were moving.  The lights were bright, they sparkled (not blinking like a plane) and they each appeared to have a small tail.  They did not appear to be too far away, although I guess the distance could be deceiving. I stopped my vehicle right on the road and watched them for about 10 to 20 seconds.  During that time they traveled about a quarter of the way across the sky from west to east.  They remained in a straight line at the same distance apart the whole time.  I did not hear anything, although my windows were up.  Another car approached from behind so I turned onto the next road, hoping to see them again, but never did. I know what a meteor looks like, and this was not one. I thought it may be a plane on fire, but nothing like that was reported. It could have been space debris? Afterwards, I drove back to the original spot looking for some explanation (house lights, spot lights, reflections, etc) but found nothing that could explain it. I thought I was crazy until a friend at work told me that a friend of his had seen similar lights on the same night.  Then I searched the Internet and found similar reports from the same night.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241
