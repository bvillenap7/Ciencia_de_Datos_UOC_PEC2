While at work which takes me outside off and on I looked up at 4:00 pm and there were 2 objects that caught my attention. First I thought they were birds but they were too high up.  Both objects were at the same height and about 300 feet apart moving in the same direction.  There was a cloud ahead  that they were lost in from my line of sight. About 20 minutes later there was another object I saw from an open door area that seemed to drop down then level off and move away at a lower level then the first 2. Several minutes later a co-worker walked by and then there was another object in about the same location as the first 2.  This last 1 moved sort of aimlessly slowly moving up in height until being lost in the distance.  There was a 3rd person to see the last object and we sort of agreed it looked like a balloon but I am not entirely sure about that after seeing the first 3 objects.
