Triangle shaped (white only) lights observed flying directly over head apeared to be one solid object;1977-08-01 22:00:00;3 minutes;Triangle shaped (white only) lights observed flying directly over head apeared to be one solid object I was sitting on my front porch enjoying a clear sky summer evening when I noticed what I thought to be a large low flying plane with its landing lights on coming over the ridge line several miles to the north.  I was 17 years old at the time and had lived on Air force bases for most of my life and was quite used to seeing airplanes at night, but it concerned me that this one appeared to be quite low and unusual even at a distance.  I poked my head inside the front door and called for my Dad to come check out what I was seeing. (My dad was a Retired Air force Colonel) and had been a pilot for 30 years.  My dad and I watched the object as it approached and as it got closer and passed overhead it presented itself as 5 seperate white lights in a triangular shape.  It flew a steady heading and there was no sound whatsover.   It is unlike any object that I have ever seen in the sky, it appeared to be low (2 or 3 thousand) but it really is impossible to tell at night.  But if it was much higher, then what doesnt make sense is how it appeared when I first saw it appear on the horizon...at that time it looked just like a large jetliner does when it is coming right at you with its landing lights on.  Several other neighboors watched it pass over, and while it was not spectacular, it was certainely unusual, and it did not have any red or green navigation lights, just white lights in a triangle shape.   This has bothered me ever since I saw it, and because I am a constant sky watcher, I have seen aircraft of every possible size and shape in all kinds of weather conditions.

I watched as the object turned to its left and at that point i noticed a third light all three creating a triangular shape,all three lights were white in color and constantly on.   I watched as it flew towards Enola, PA, behind the object was a passanger plane flying which gave me a perspective as to its speed and height in the sky.   The object was flying lower than usual aircraft we regularly see and much faster.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241
Silent Triangular Craft over Harrisburg, PA.;2015-08-13 00:15:00;~10 seconds;Silent Triangular Craft over Harrisburg, PA. I was riding passenger while my girlfriend was driving North on I-81, around Mechanicsburg/Harrisburg (Near Exit 57).  I saw what appeared to be a falling star, but when I noticed it, it stopped IMMEDIATELY.  I mean, on a dime.   It then swooped over the car, and went from an altitude of about 20 ft to 200 ft or so, and then zipped up into the night sky.  I couldn't find it after looking again. August 12-13th, 2015.  Around midnight, but before 12:30.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241
