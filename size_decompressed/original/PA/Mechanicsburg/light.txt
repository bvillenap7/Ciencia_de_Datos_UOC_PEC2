Seen unusual light in sky;1998-11-24 22:30:00;30 min.+;Seen unusual light in sky At 22:30 on 11/24/98 I went outside on break to have a smoke and was looking around in the sky. I noticed a strange light that was changing colors and at first thought it was an aircraft taking off from Harris- burg airport. Then I noticed it wasn't moving and joked to a coworker that ET was coming to take him away. From our warehouse the light seemed to be about 20 degree's off the horizon in a east south east direction. There were 3 light colors going from blue to white to red in that order. The size of the light was about 3/4 the size of a pencil eraser at arms length. I understand that stars somtimes (twinkle) and planets do not however no other stars doing anythig odd at this time.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241
Pink light in the sky;2009-07-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;I saw a pink light in the sky off to the west of me.  At first thought it was just from a firework since it was 4th of July.  But when it didn't burn out, I noticed it was moving across the sky, in the same flight patterns that I have seen numerous planes take while landing at Harrisburg International Airport.  But I don't ever remember seeing one with a pink landing light.  I watched as it flew overhead and noticed that there were no strobes where there should have been wings or the tail.  It was just a light with no shape that I could make out.  I also noticed that there was no sound as it flew overhead.  As it headed east towards the airport, it disappeared.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241
Blue, Pink and Violet Lights.;2013-11-01 06:45:00;2-3 minutes;Blue, Pink and Violet Lights. Heavy rains and wind. looking out my kitchen window and facing due west.  about 300 yards away. beyond treelined horizon and skyline.   I saw the area in the facing direction light up bright blue for about 3-4 seconds. after 30 seconds it lit up bright pink for about 3-4 seconds.  It lit up blue again and stopped. I went outside to get a better view and I saw the whole facing area light up violet for about 3- 4 seconds.   This entire time I heard no noise that would indicate lighting.  Thought it might be a power outage but none were reported in the area.  The rain subsided and I did not see to lights again.   Very interesting and hope to learn of an explanation.  If I don't that's ok, too.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241
3 bright lights seen in a vertical line that disappeared and reappeared randomly, one by one.;2015-08-05 21:20:00;1.5 minutes;3 bright lights seen in a vertical line that disappeared and reappeared randomly, one by one. My experience occurred on Wednesday, August 5, 2015.  The sighting time was somewhere around 21:20 because I came into my house, explained to my dad what I had just seen, used the restroom and sent my significant other a text about the sighting at 21:26.   I was driving home from work that Wednesday evening.  My shift ended at 21:00.  I was in the home stretch.  As I turned onto a back road I saw some really bright lights in front of me in the dark sky.  The light was bright white and almost like a starburst.  It was brighter and larger than a light on any airplane I have ever seen.  There were three lights clustered close together in a vertical line. The lights were hovering.  As one light went out for a few seconds the top light lit up.  Then the light that was out reappeared.  This continued a few times.  The lights would disappear and reappear randomly.  I kept an eye on it for as long as I could while I turned into my neighborhood.  When I parked in my driveway I could no longer find it.  My sighting lasted no longer than a minute and a half.  During this experience I did not hear anything.  I was so unsure of what was happening that I forgot I even owned a phone… Therefore, I have no documentation. I had brushed my sighting to the side and forgot about it until today.  My mom was listening to Coast to Coast Am talk show online when I got home from work.  She was listening to the program for August 6, 2015.  There was a segment about UFO sightings.  She heard about a sighting in Palmyra, Pennsylvania, which is not too far from us.  That sighting happened on the same day and around the same time.  This is what provoked me to look further into what I saw.  I googled “UFO sightings August 2015, PA”.  I found a sighting posted to another website.  This sighting happened in my same town, on the same night, and around the same time.  Their sighting that night was nearly identical to mine.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241

Four orange yellow lights side by side in a slight 15 degree angle slanting to the right.;2017-01-31 18:40:00;3 minutes;Four orange yellow lights side by side in a slight 15 degree angle slanting to the right. Sighting 6:40 pm 1/31/17 Mechanicsburg, PA  I was driving east on US RT 11 locally called the Carlisle Pike at about 6:40 pm I noticed unusual lights in the sky to the right South of my location about 50 degrees off the horizon.  The lights where four orange yellow lights in a downward sloping angle about 15 degrees.  The lights appeared to be round.  It was well above the tree line but too low for a commercial aircraft unless it was landing in Harrisburg, the location seemed off in regards to a plane landing and the lights were solid not flashing as planes normally do.  The lights appeared to be stationary and not moving as a plane would. It's important to note that the Moon was behind me and that while Venus is currently just to the right of the moon and Mars just above the Moon forming a triangle this was not in the area of the sky where this sighting took place. Mechanicsburg is in the middle of the Cumberland Valley part of the Great Appalachian Valley just west of Harrisburg PA.  Two major highways pass by Mechanicsburg to the South the Pennsylvania Turnpike and just to the North interstate 81.  I reference this because the Turnpike is used as guide into Philadelphia International by planes coming from the West, it's also the flight path of the local medivac helicopter from its base in Carlisle, PA.  There is a large amount of air traffic that flies high over my neighborhood daily. As I drove I tried keeping my eyes on the object and the road as traffic was flowing  steadily for post rush hour so I didn't have an opportunity to pull over.  I made sure to note the time and reached for my cell phone to try and get a picture.  When I opened my camera app on my iPhone the camera app malfunctioned giving me a screen of green bars horizontally and up and down.  During the process of closing the app restarting the app and driving the lights disappeared. Mechanicsburg is home to the Naval Support Activity Mechanicsburg, a 806 acre facility with over 150 buildings, including a Department of Defense rail yard including Nuclear Cask railroad cars. The area of the light anomaly was over the area occupied by this installation. I'm a special education teacher by degree and career.  I teach children with learning disabilities in a neighboring school district.  I am fascinated by paranormal topics, but never thought I'd be writing a report about an observation I would have.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241
