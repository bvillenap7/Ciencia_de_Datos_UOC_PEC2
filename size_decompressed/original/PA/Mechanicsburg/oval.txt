A pinkish diamond shaped light floating in the sky;2015-06-13 23:15:00;5 minutes;A pinkish diamond shaped light floating in the sky Driving from Mechanicsburg toward Boiling Springs on Rt. 174.  As we approached Locust Point Rd., I notice a light, pinkish in color, in the sky to my right.  It was diamond shape and was not flashing.  It appeared to be hovering.   As we passed Locust Point Rd., we pulled over so I could get video with my phone.  I got video from the car but when I exited the car the light was gone.  We turned around and went back.   As we were turing around I saw an oval object, dark but outlined going over Rt. 74.   We headed back to Locust Point Rd. and turned right, the way the object was heading.  We drove a couple 100 yards and stopped.  I could not see anything or hear anything.   One of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241
