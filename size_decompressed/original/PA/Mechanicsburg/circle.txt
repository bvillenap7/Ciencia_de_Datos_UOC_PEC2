Strange ball of light flashed in and disappears.;2012-07-11 23:30:00;8 seconds;Strange ball of light flashed in and disappears. Sitting on bench during break talking to one other person. A small flash caught my attention in the sky. As I looked up, I seen a ball of light slowly floating to the left thinking it was a plane. As I watched, noticed it wasn't blinking at all and slowly started to fade away getting smaller. No clouds in sky, clear night.  I should have also reported that around the same time on June 27th the entire sky lit up green, but didn't know how to report until now.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241

Walking outside, saw a bright green circle appear in the sky and shoot off to the north, leaving the visible area within 1-2 seconds. This is a circle, not like a ball.  The outline of the circle was green and was roughly the same size in the sky as the moon would be.;40.1978689655173;-77.0159965517241
