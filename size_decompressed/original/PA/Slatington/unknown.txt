Object with red lights made hard 90 degree turn without slowing down.;2016-08-18 22:00:00;10-20 seconds;Object with red lights made hard 90 degree turn without slowing down. Around 22-23:00 near the town on Slatington, Pennsylvania, on the 16, 17 or 18th of August, 2016, my wife and I saw an object with 2 solid red lights and a flashing white light attached to it.   It was headed west.   It made a 90 degree turn to the south without slowing down.   I wouldn't try to estimate the elevation or size of the object.   The hard 90 degree turn is what made it mysterious.   It could possibly be a drone, I don't think it was though.  A few months ago we saw an aircraft at night in the same location, with the same red light pattern fly over the house and leave a long lasting contrail.  Thank you for your time and attention.;40.7368;-75.6167
