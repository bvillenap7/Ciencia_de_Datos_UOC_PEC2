I had been riding in my go-cart when I has stopped for a second and looked at the sun which had begun to set. I saw a large oval-shaped craft that was black in color and blocked out half of the sun. It stayed in the same location for about 3 minutes and then I saw another smaller craft of same shape and color come out of the original craft. The smaller craft then went approx. 300 miles per hour behind my point of view. The larger craft then speed off towards the sky at an amazing speed. During the siting the first aircraft stayed at about 2,000-3,000ft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.7368;-75.6167
