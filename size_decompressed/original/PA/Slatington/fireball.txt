Three bright orange orbs traveling east out of town.;2014-07-26 22:58:00;4 minutes;Three bright orange orbs traveling east out of town. My daughter and I were taking our nightly walk and when coming down a hill three orange orbs came from behind the hill in front of us.   We were looking south and they were traveling east.   They were first traveling very close to one another. One took off south another east and the last just seemed to disappear.  I got to pictures not very good though.  This is the 5 the time in two year we and other witnesses have seen them over Slatington, PA. They were very bright orange.   Very cool to see.;40.7368;-75.6167
