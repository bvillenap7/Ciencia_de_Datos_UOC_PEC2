Light just hovered 10-20 degrees above horizon for ~20 minutes. Noticed a bright light in the sky, thought it was a plane but it did not move.  After a few minutes, viewed through  binoculars and saw that the light was actually a series of lights in the shape of a cross, with 5 or 6 lights vertically and the same amount horizontally.  The brightest light was where the horizontal and vertical lights intersected at the center of the cross. The light was stationary for the longest time, allowing me to call my wife and have her view it through the binoculars.  She saw the same thing. After about 20 minutes, it started to move away from us and faded out over the next 5 minutes.  It's position in the sky did not change as it faded, rather it appeared to move away from us.  My wife thinks I'm nuts, though she saw the same thing.;40.0459000000001;-75.5307
