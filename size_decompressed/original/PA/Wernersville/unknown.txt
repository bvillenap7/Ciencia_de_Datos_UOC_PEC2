@~10am this morning, something crossed the entire sky and went over our house in roughly 2 seconds. ((anonymous report));2019-06-06 10:45:00;2-3 seconds;At about 10am this morning something crossed the entire sky and went over our house in roughly 2 seconds.  It woke me from a dead sleep as it was very loud and fast, sounding similar to a snowplow scraping the road but at a ridiculous speed, everything rumbled.    Approximately 45 minutes later, the same event occurred traveling the opposite direction.  I ran to the window immediately and saw nothing and the immensely loud sound was gone, as fast as it happened.   Multiple jets were flying around the area in the hours that followed, but I cannot stress enough that this was unlike any jet or anything else that I've ever heard fly overhead.  The speed at which it crossed the sky was unbelievable.   I checked with a friend down the street and he verified that he heard this as well .
