We saw an orange orb or circular object moving at a high rate of speed from west to northeast.  The object did not have any navigation lights and did not make any noise.   A few minutes later another orange orb or ball came out of the west and followed the same path as the first one.  We never saw anything like this before and are curious about what we saw.;41.0255;-75.8834
