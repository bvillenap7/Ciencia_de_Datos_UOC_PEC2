Fireball;2005-10-31 19:15:00;20 sec;We were trick or treating with our daughters Halloween night.   My husband and i both saw a fireball in the sky. Looked lower than any meteor I have ever seen. It was very bright and had fire that looked like it was dripping from the actual ball.  It also seemed to be moving much slower than a shooting star.;39.9192745454546;-77.6487072727273
strange sightings;2011-08-20 21:00:00;5 mins;Last night at approx. 8:40 pm my entire family noticed strange sightings in the sky.  It appeared to be very bright, and moving in a formation.  It was not as high as a normal airplane would be seen.  As it disappeared it appeared as if the lights went out.  Having a Military Base near we thought maybe they were doing some sort of testing.  It was very interesting and we can not place a name on the objects.;39.9192745454546;-77.6487072727273
