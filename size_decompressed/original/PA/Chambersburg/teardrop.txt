To the South, heading North was an odd shaped, fast moving flying object gaining speed to the jet fighter on its port side.  The contrails made the jet obvious to identify.  The second flying object was oddly shaped in comparison to the fighter jet. The two objects seemed to almost have a midair collision.  I took a picture before the near miss and a video after. I failed to get my view of what I believe to two flying objects almost colliding.  One was a fighter jet and the other was an unfamiliar craft traveling at a high rate of speed.  My logical answer would be a possible drone photoshoot of a fighter jet? That still does explain the speed difference between the two.  The jet looked sluggish and slow in comparison.  If there was a near miss mid air collision, there should be a report.  It may be nothing,  I'm not experienced enough to identify the object in the picture and/or video.;39.9192745454546;-77.6487072727273

I email the picture of the before close call and a video of after.  I missed the close contact shot.  The jet was easily identified by its contrails.  It was traveling East to West.  The UFO was in the port side of the jet coming from the South heading North.  I'm not experienced enough to identify the other flying craft.  It did fly at a higher rate of speed compared to the jet.  The craft also seemed to fly funny.  Almost like a studded before a burst of acceleration.  It's possible that the flying object was part of a training exercise.  The UFO made the jet look sluggish and rugged in comparison.;39.9192745454546;-77.6487072727273
