As soon as i got to the 6 mile marker in pennsylvania i noticed this aircraft in the air hovering over an area approx 500 yards or more west.  it was shining what seemed like a spot light over the area.  as i approached the state line i saw the craft fly past me in the same direction at the approx the same distance westward.  when i got to the 11 mile marker in MD i noticed it hovering over an area approx the same distance westward.  it was shining what seemed like a spot light over this area also.  the flight from point a to point b seemed rapid.  there were other bright white lights on the object also.  it was really dark over these areas so i couldnt get an idea of the shape of the craft.  there was just one low flying craft, no others were present around it.  it seemed to be about the size of a medium sized automobile.
