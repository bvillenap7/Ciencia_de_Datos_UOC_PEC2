On November 22, 2005 on a Tuesday night at 8:40 P.M. me and a friend saw something in the sky that looked like a cigar shaped object it was blue with a red tail. It made no sound it left a trail. We saw it in my front yard. We watched it and we saw it over the house. Then it was gone and wasn't in sight no more. There was no sound to the object. It was cloudy outside. But we looked and saw the object no more.;39.9192745454546;-77.6487072727273
2 white cigar-shaped objects with a central black band traveling east to west.;2014-01-12 11:00:00;10-15 minutes;2 white cigar-shaped objects with a central black band traveling east to west. Two cigar-shaped vessels with the common black band around the middle were spotted traveling approximately from east to west.  It was a clear sky with no clouds and very sunny.  The second craft seemed to be farther behind the first as it was smaller in perspective.  No sounds were heard and no trails of any kind were seen. Originally the craft were traveling in a straight line, then they appeared to stop for a short moment and remained motionless until they began to slowly disappear from sight as they then appeared to travel away from my line of sight into the vanishing point. The size of the main craft, in perspective, would have been the same as holding a Tylenol capsule out toward the sky at arms length.
