I was looking at the sky about 13:30 today July 10, 2008 when I noticed an unusual situation, i.e. a double rainbow around the sun. The obvious explanation is that there was some water/ice crystals between myself and the sun. I went in to get my camera to see if I could take a picture.  I took five pictures from 18 mm to 55 mm at slightly different angles, using automatic and A/DEP modes on my Canon EOS Rebel XT Digital camera. I saved the three most interesting images, taken about a minute apart starting at 13:46.  When I looked at the images I noticed a really unusual part to the first image only. It looks like an old Mercury Space Capsule on reentry, only upside down from my point of view. I printed the pictures including two versions of the first one with zoom. Unfortunately I only used the 3 meg resolution of the Canonâ€™s 8 meg possible so the zoomed images are pretty fuzzy.
