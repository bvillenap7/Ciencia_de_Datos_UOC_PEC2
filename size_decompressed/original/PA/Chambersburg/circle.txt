Bright orb like object moving very fast in an alrming route of motion.;2017-02-20 18:30:00;~2 minutes;Bright orb like object moving very fast in an alrming route of motion. Approximately 02/20/2017 at around 18:30, I was delivering pizza and entered I81 north via exit 16 of Chambersburg, Pa. After about a quarter mile of being on the highway, I happened to look to my left as I was headed north on I 81.  I observed a bright light in the sky.  I couldn’t see too many stars if at all between the light pollution of the town and the cloudy sky.  I was watching the light as best I could because it was unusually bright considering the circumstances.  After approximately 45 to 60 seconds the light that appeared to be at a standstill.  And then the light appeared to be making a vertical drop as if it was falling to the ground at an alarming rate of speed.  Originally it appeared to be a few miles above the ground and dropped to maybe a few hundred yards.  (approximately)  After it reached to appear to be a few hundred yards above the ground, it came to a stop and appeared to be hovering.   At this point, I was coming up to exit 17 of 81 north, when the object began to move again, going towards my left, and appearing to make a movement towards the north east of my position.  It made a complete stop again for approximately 15 to 20 seconds, then in an instant, took off at an incredible rate of speed appearing to make a north-western direction from my position, gaining a slight amount of altitude, then it was just gone in a flash.    At this point I was approximately half a mile past exit 17 of 81 north.  It lasted only about 2 minutes.  At first, I was not sure what to think because I have never seen anything like this.  Chambersburg is not far from Washington, D.C., and we have multiple military bases in and around our area.  I have seen many military aircraft in our skies, but nothing anything close to this.  I’m not sure what to think.  I am not even convinced it was alien, but I never seen an air craft move like that that fast and be a solid light, as if it was an orb.
