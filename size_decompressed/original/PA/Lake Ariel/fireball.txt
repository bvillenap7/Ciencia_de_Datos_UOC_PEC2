Four fireballs in the night sky.;2013-12-01 18:00:00;1 minute;Four fireballs in the night sky. Driving home from dinner, my girlfriend and I suddenly saw these four bright orange lights glowing in the night sky.  I stopped the car,  look!  You see that!  We pulled the car over to the side and watched each one dim and suddenly vanish.  The whole event lasted about a minute.   The larger ball stayed the longest, while the tie small ones in the middle faded within 30 seconds if us spotting them.   They must have been there longer than we noticed!   The four fireballs were clustered together in a small group, right above the trees and low enough to catch you're eye while driving.;41.4396;-75.4315999999999
