Something caught my eye in the sky in front of me.  I looked up and saw an orange, glowing, ball moving slowly.  It then picked up speed instantly.  It shot across the sky so fast it was incredible.   I yelled out ''look at the shooting star.  My girlfriend caught the end of it before it went below the horizon.  She said Wow, that was so fast.   As I was saying shooting star I started thinking I've never seen a shooting star that didn't have a tail.  Also I've never seen a glowing orange shooting star.  I've seen many shooting stars and they always had a long tail, were white or blue, and got bright then dim and died out.  This thing maintained its orange brightness, had no trail behind it at all, and only disapeared because it went beyond our field of vision. It was also large compared to stars.  Hard to describe the size, best I can do right now is to say,  If you hold a standard q-tip at arms length and look at it head on. It went what looked like North/ Northeast toward Susquehanna county PA or Upstate New York.  Once again, hard to judge.  As far as I know it could have came down not too far away after It went behind the trees and mountains. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));41.4396;-75.4315999999999
