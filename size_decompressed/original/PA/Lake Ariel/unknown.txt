At approximately 21:45 I was watching for the meteor shower tonight.  Directly overhead seen a bright light that was too high to be a airplane.  It at first was not moving, so thought it to be just a star that came out of cloud cover.  Then it started to move very slowly and then eventually disappear.  Like I said it was too high to be a airplane.  It also was too bright to be a satellite.;41.4396;-75.4315999999999
