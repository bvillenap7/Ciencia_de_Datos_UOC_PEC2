Fireball.;2013-09-14 22:00:00;5-6 minutes;Sitting outside and a red fireball came into view and seemed to hover for several seconds like coming to a halt, and then moving on slowly, changing speeds to seemingly dissipate.   Roughly, five minutes later another fireball oval in shape more orange/red in color shared the same path, not hovering or halting, but moving slowly same speed across sky to dissipate.   both travel paths were from NW to West-almost a circular path.  Both also appeared to have what looked like sparks all around or some other type of brightness.;40.0877;-76.4131
