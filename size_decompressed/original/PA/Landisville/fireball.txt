The first objects I notice are 2 bright fireballs traveling diagonally up from the northern part of the sky to the west.  One is behind the other one significantly.  Initially they are a steady, un-blinking orange-yellow.  As I stare at them directly, I also notice an oval-shaped black spot moving more rapidly in the opposite direction.  After starting at the bright fireballs for about 15-25 seconds, the upper orange ball begins blinking, and then disappears.  The lower ball follows suite. 	After all 3 are gone from sight (the two balls & the black oval), I notice a tiny blue spot moving in the fashion of a satellite in orbit.  However, after it travels horizontally from the northern section of the sky to the east, its pace slows down, almost to a halt.  For a few minutes I can’t see it at all.   Then, my eyes gazing in that general direction, I can see it again, appearing to barely be moving at all.  It suddenly grows rapidly brighter, and then dwindles quickly and I’m again unable to see it..;40.0877;-76.4131
