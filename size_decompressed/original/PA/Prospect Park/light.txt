Ball of flashing, sparkling multicolored light;2001-01-25 02:30:00;30+ min.;Ball of flashing, sparkling multicolored light On the night of January 25, 2001 I awoke and had trouble falling back to sleep. I got up and went to the kitchen for a drink.  It was a bright clear night and I glanced out the kitchen window, where an unusually bright star in the southwest sky, perhaps 40-45 degrees above the horizon, caught my attention. I had never seen such a sparkling, colorful star before! Red and blue light flashed from it, in a way similar to the flashing lights on police cars.  I watched it, fascinated, for a short time and then ran for my binoculars (I don't have a telescope) but they revealed no details.  The object looked like a ball of glowing light emitting sparks and spikes of colored light.  It didn't move at all during the approximately 30 minutes I observed it, but a couple of times it appeared to fade slightly and then brighten again, and it was still there when I finally went back to bed. I haven't seen it since. I was prompted to submit this report after I read of a similar sighting that occurred in Telford, Pa., which is about 30 miles from Prospect Park.
