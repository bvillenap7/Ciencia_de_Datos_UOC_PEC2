Lights and Craft in Clarion, PA;1977-06-30 22:00:00;1 hour;Lights and Craft in Clarion, PA We were in Clarion,Pa. and stopped at a home there and looked up when we got out of the car and on top of the ridge was a large diamond shaped craft with rounded corners, color of metal was like a B-1 bomber, blackish gray...it has different colored lites around it flashing and blinking and it was stopped and it was totally silent......when we got back in the car and drove away it followed us and we keep driving and it followed along side of us till we got to a field and then it shot off into the field and cocked it's self at an angle (/) and then turned bright orangish pinkish color and then shot off up into the sky at a high rate of speed and was gone. I looked in the paper the next morning, Pittsburgh paper, and on the front cover a professor from Pittsburgh saw it too.......i think i had a much closer look than he did though, i am telling you this now cause i have recently been seeing lights in the sky in Texas where i live now..and my new husband is very supportive, and ex-military............
