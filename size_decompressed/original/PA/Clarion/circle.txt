It was drifting west bu the wind was out of the west. Then it stopped for several minutes. It was about a mile of less away and probably in the range of 800 to a 1000 feet in the air. It had no gondola on the bottom and it glowed like the moon would glow when it's full. The coloring was that of the moon but with some tinted areas on the surfaced of pale oranges and blues. It seemed to be lit inside the object. I grabbed my digital still camera out of my car and took three pictures of the craft, then went into the house and got my cam corder. When I came out it was gone after about 30 seconds. No ballooon can move that fast. There was no sound qat all. When I got back home to Illinois I downloaded the three images I took and they  were blank. That has never happened before or since with my camera.;41.2102;-79.3771
