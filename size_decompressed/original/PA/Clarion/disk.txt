As I returned from work late one evening, I saw a UFO as I was standing in the Freshman parking lot. This parking lot is over a hill and out of sight (or shouting distance) from the rest of campus. I was the only person in the vicinity at the time. What follows is my best remembrance of the event. I saw a vertical disc shaped object (symmetrically rounded on both sides). It was smooth and dark colored and had dim lights on the rim. It seemed to be moving by rotating slowly like an upright wheel. It was almost totally silent although there seemed to be a very slight humming noise. It was very low in the air, seemingly only a few hundred yards above my head, and so I could see it's outline quite clearly although the object itself was very dark and only dimly lit. It appeared quite large to me although I had nothing to judge it's size against and I could not tell for certain how far above me it was. It came from the direction of the town of Clarion and and it eventually passed out of sight as it continued ENE over the woods (state game lands 74).  The whole experience lasted about a minute and I was very clear-headed throughout. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));41.2102;-79.3771
