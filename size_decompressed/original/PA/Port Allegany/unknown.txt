My sister and I were walking out from our high school after wrestling practice.  We were in the parking lot walking to her car.  I noticed a couple of strange aircrafts that had had perfectly orange circles just floating in the sky.  Then another one appeared and the other one disapeared.  Then it came back again and did it for a couple of minutes.  My sister got a couple of pictures of the floating lights.;41.8137;-78.289
