I really couldn't see the craft but i seen that the last chopper was a distance behind from the rest.  I suddenly had this awful feeling that something was not right and they were not flying fast neither. I looked around to see If anyone was around or noticed but i didn't see anyone, just a car passing by.  The dog was acting weird and pulling harder than usual which then prompted me to cut the walk short return back to where we had just walked from.
