I was sitting in my living room, and I suddenly heard this loud humming sound coming from outside.   I looked out my window and everything had this green glow.  It was like I had green sunglasses on.  I could feel the vibration all around me.   Then after about 30 seconds, both the green glow and humming sound disappeared.  I have no idea what it was.  I have never experienced anything like it before, or have ever since that night.;40.7908;-76.5558
