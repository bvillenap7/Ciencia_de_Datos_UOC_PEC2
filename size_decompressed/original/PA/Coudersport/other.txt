Looked like flashing headlights in the sky;2020-07-05 22:31:00;2 minutes;Looked like flashing headlights in the sky. My daughter and I we're driving into town when we noticed two lights in the sky that were not moving.  On one side was a blue light(my daughter thought green) and on the other end was a red light.  Then beside each colored light two big bright white lights began to flash.  It looked like someone kept flashing their headlights but in the sky above us.  My daughter tried to get a video, but you couldn't really make anything out, even though it didn't look far away to the naked eye.  20 minutes later, when we came back through the area, it was no where to be found.;41.7762;-77.9567
