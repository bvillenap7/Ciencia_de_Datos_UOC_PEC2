Red fireball floating in the sky over Coudersport, PA;2017-07-26 22:15:00;4 minutes;Red fireball floating in the sky over Coudersport, PA.   I observed a red and orange ball of light moving slowly, from East to West, for about 2 minutes.  When the ball was approximately 1 mile from town, and about 2000 feet above the ground, it turned to the right.  The ball then proceeded to travel North over a hill rising at a faster pace than its East to West movement. The total time was just about 4 minutes and I was able to get a picture and take a minute and a half video.  Both are horrible quality, as it was on my phone and very low light.;41.7762;-77.9567
