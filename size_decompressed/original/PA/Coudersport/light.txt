Cherry Spring State Park UFO;2019-09-07 23:00:00;30 minutes;Cherry Spring State Park UFO Me, my brother, my best friend and a close buddy (all college graduates, professionals in our late 20’s, early 30’s) were stargazing at while camping at cherry spring state park. We first saw a shooting star and thought that would be the coolest thing we saw or maybe if lucky we would see the milky way. Instead we saw an odd shaped craft off in the distance that was flickering red and blue lights or a purplish light. We were all taken back cause it was unlike anything we expected to see or had seen before. We thought maybe it was a satellite or a space station. But then it began to move in a direct line to the right (a few inches in the sky) and then in a direct smooth and controlled line back to where it was. Intelligent coordinated movement. This left us questioning what the hell did we see? I am now confident that we saw a UFO;41.7762;-77.9567
