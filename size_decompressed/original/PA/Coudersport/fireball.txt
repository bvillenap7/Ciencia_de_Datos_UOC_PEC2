Orange fireball witnessed in Northern PA on July 4th, 2010;2010-07-04 22:20:00;2-3 minutes;Orange fireball witnessed in Northern PA on July 4th, 2010 On July 4, 2010, my husband, daughter, myself, and two friends were sitting outside at our camp.  The camp is located approximately half way between Coudersport, PA and Galeton, PA (not too far from Denton Hill State Park).  Sometime around 22:20, we noticed an orange fireball going slowly across the sky.  The fireball appeared to be traveling from North to (SouthEast).  The five of us were astonished.  It did not look like a plane or helicopter.  It was definitely an orange glowing ball.  My husband and friend felt for sure they saw some type of tail at the end of it.  I did not notice it.  The fireball was traveling in a fairly straight line at first.  Then it seemed to change directions (zigzag) several times, almost as though it was losing its course.  After viewing this for several minutes, the glow became less and less until we couldn’t see it anymore.  It did not appear to have traveled out of view, but more like it burnt out.  It was not a shooting s! tar and did not look like a meteor.  Nor, was it ‘The Northern Lights’, not even close.  It also was not part of a fireworks display.  It was extremely high in the sky.  For those people who may say it was just too much July 4th celebrating, our 14 year old daughter witnessed this also.;41.7762;-77.9567
