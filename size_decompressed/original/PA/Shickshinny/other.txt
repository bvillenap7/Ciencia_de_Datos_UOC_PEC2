Odd blue flash in southeastern sky.;2017-12-02 03:00:00;seconds;Odd blue flash in southeastern sky. It was foggy misty and overcast.  It was a little after 3 a.m. time is not exact either way. The Southeastern sky flashed with this odd blueish color for a few seconds.  I thought perhaps there was a distant storm as there was a cold front moving through and it was colder. I kept watching for it to happen again, but it did not. It was very overcast, but the moon was still casting a lot of light.;41.1605;-76.1192
