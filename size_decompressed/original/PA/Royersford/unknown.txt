Light no sound;2008-11-22 01:55:00;0.1;Light no sound I'm sorry this reporting is brief, i'm only reporting this in case others did too as i had no camera.   I took my dog for a walk and i looked up to the stars as i always do, it was partially clear, i saw a light heading toward me, it was going fast so i thought it was a helicopter, i see them all the time, it was the height of a helicopter but the strange thing was that there was no sound, it just appeared and went right over my head, i did see that it had a green light at the back of it, i honestly think it was from earth, it looked too much like a helicopter or a plane .. light wise .. but the only reason i type this is because there was no sound.. Kind regards;40.2062;-75.53
