Multi Colored UFO, Above the Limerick Power Plants (silent);2012-04-27 23:27:00;25-35min;Multi Colored UFO, Above the Limerick Power Plants(silent) Approximately, 11:27PM Est. My girlfriend and I we're looking out of our bedroom window, which you can see the Limerick Power Plants Clear as day. Well upon looking out of our bedroom windows we saw a very bright Orange sphere to the left of the power plants. This orb was pulsating orange, dimming and brightening. We thought it was Venus or Mars but we used Google Sky and there we're no stars or planets in the area.  So we continued to watch the orb for about 10-15 minutes, noticing that it was slowly dropping to the treeline.  Once it touched the top of the treeline it vanished.  So i continued to just watch the sky as my girlfriend went down stairs. Literally 5min after her going downstairs, i see a Oval like UFO, changing Multiple colors (Red,Blue,White,Green,Orange)  Almost all spectrum's of the rainbow.  Which had came from the treeline's, Dash past the Limerick Power Plants. Going behind the smoke from the tower's to the other side of the treelines, and dove back in. Let me remind you that is a NON Fly Zone.  Noticing what i did, i rushed downstairs to tell my girlfriend. Once i did we went to the backdoor (All Glass) and watch the treeline. Literally as I'm mentioning what i saw, we heard 1-3 Helicopters with no lights in the sky. Sounding like they we're heading to the power plants. Once we heard the copters, The UFO Burst out of the treeline continued towards the power plants smoke. Once it dove into or behind the smoke, it took off with the smoking almost blocking everyone's view.;40.2062;-75.53
