I live along a flight path for Philadelphia airport and a small local airport in limerick so I was able to judge the altitude.  I seen about 4 high flying plains that leave vapor fly under this thing so it was pretty high up.  It moved very slow over my house for about 2 hours until it went out of sight.  We looked at it with a telescope and spotting scope and we could see white lights on it.  Threw the scope it looked like a saucer with lights evenly around the outside with a break in the middle.;40.2062;-75.53
