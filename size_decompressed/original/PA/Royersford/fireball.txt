Orange fireball floats by royersford - limerick PA;2012-05-28 22:00:00;2+ minutes;Orange fireball floates by royersford - limerick PA I heard some people firing off fireworks ~9:45 (It is Memorial Day)and looked out the window only to remember to water the garden. So I went out at 10:00 and started to water when a few more very loud firecrakers went off.  I could see the reflection of them in my neighbors window.  Then as I turned around to shut the hose off I noticed a silet orange small fireball float by.  I thought it might have been an ember from the earlier firework still floating by but it never came to the ground and floated between my house and the neighbors appoximately 4-5 stories high and headed north over the neighborhood and then I lost sight.  What is strange about this is that on the 4th of July, two years in a row, at roughly the same time, I have seen the same thing floating by in the same general direction, and although I was alone tonight both of those two time their were many neighbors out who witnessed.
