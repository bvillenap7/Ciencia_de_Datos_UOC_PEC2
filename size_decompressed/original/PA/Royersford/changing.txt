Three objects moving from one point to another and repeating pattern for one hour.;2009-03-29 20:00:00;1 hour;Three objects moving from one point to another and repeating pattern for one hour. I saw an orange glow above my neighbors house, which is 5 houses away, and it would move quickly above the woods behind my house, but as it moved it looked like the lights under or around it were moving in like a figure eight type of movement and the lights as it moved were now white, red, and green. From the tree line it would very quickly go back to hovering at the end of the street again and then there were 2 more. It repeated this movement several times. I had a camera and took some pictures, but when I reviewed them it looks so far away. I will try and attach.
