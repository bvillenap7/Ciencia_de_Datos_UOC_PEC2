I was taking digital photos as the eclipse proceeded, at five minute intervals. I didn't upload this wafer to the computer until I heard you on the Art Bell show tonigt. I wondered if I had captured anything with the camera and took a look. I have several photos that just show the eclipsing moon, in the beginning stages, and then was shocked to see this one with all the lights in it. I can send you the group of photos leading up to and the one which captured the lights, if you like.  If it was a trick of the camera, I don't understand why this one would be the only one with the lights. I also have several taken after the lights that show just the moon. Please e-mail to request the series of photos, if you would like to have them.;41.1787;-76.0743
