8+ red-orange lights in south-central Pennsylvania.;2014-03-01 19:00:00;3+ minutes;8+ red-orange lights in south-central Pennsylvania. Location: Everett, Bedford County, Pennsylvania. Time: Approx. 19:00 Conditions: night, cloudy. I saw at least 8 reddish-orange lights in the WSW sky.  There appeared to be no particular formation, although 3 in the center of the cluster reminded me of the constellation Orion.  I was driving, so I can not verify movement, although they appeared to be stationary. I lost line-of-sight of most of the lights behind trees and buildings while driving, but the ones that I could still see slowly disappeared after a few minutes (they could have gained altitude and moved above the cloud layer). I know that I was not the only witness as I passed the local ice cream stand and saw a car parked with 2 people outside staring at these lights (with the same confused expression on their faces as mine). We do get military helicopters fly over from time-to-time, but I've never seen more than 3 at a time and they tend to fly in a line following each other at the same, low altitude - and in daylight.  This cluster of lights numbered at least 8 individuals, in no noticeable formation (scattered-possible differing altitudes), and stationary or very slow moving.;40.008;-78.3739
