I looked up in the sky and noticed a light.  It was much brighter than any star I had ever seen and there were no stars visible that night.  I then noticed that it was hovering and moving slightly in a circular pattern.  It was not an airplane or a helicopter.  It made no audible noise. I watched the object for about 15 minutes.  I don't have any idea how long it was there before I noticed it or how long it was there after I stopped watching it.  I could see that the object had at least 3 different lights though at first it appeared to be a single light.  I got my digital camera and attempted to take photos but they wouldn't come out.  The glare from a streetlight was the only thing that would show up on a camera.;41.2601;-76.9069

These lights were much brighter than the stars in the sky tonight, and much larger in reference.   The 4 lights would take to box shape then line formation.  Several times 2-3 of the unknown objects would disappear below the horizon and within a few moments reappear without trace to extreme heights and back into a formation without movement again.  The unknown objects would converge on one another at very rapid speeds and then disappear for a moment, then reappear back into a shape.   Please note that our view has zero obstructions, no trees, no hillsides, no city lights, no cellular towers.   The objects gave off a reddish orange glow.   Again, we are very familiar with this area and unlike anything we have ever seen.  There were no planes or helicopters flying in the area.  The objects were visible for over 20 minutes.  They completely disappeared into the night sky approximately 23:35. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  He is former military.  PD));41.2601;-76.9069
