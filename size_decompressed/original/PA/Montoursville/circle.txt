Montoursville sightings.;2013-03-15 20:00:00;2 hours;Montoursville sightings Starting March of this year I have been seeing blinking objects there's one over the mountain, and three more above my house and around our neighborhood.   My friend tried following it and she got to Jersey Shore and it was going too fast they lost it.   It stays in the same spot for about 30 mins then moves closer then to another spot, they blink purple, orange and white and it's very fast.   I see them every night.  My friends and I see them every night for a week then they won't come back for a month or so.   There are 5 of us that see them and my friend lives out about 20 mins by lakes and they are always above the water by her house and they look the same and do the same things.
