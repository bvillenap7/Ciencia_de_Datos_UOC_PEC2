2 Lights Dancing in Sky;2020-11-05 18:00:00;3 minutes;2 Lights Dancing in Sky Looking up in the night sky in Pine Grove I was attempting to watch the metor showers.  Looking up, at first I thought I saw two satallites.  However they started changing directions and seems too close together to be satatlittes.  The two of them would stop then move left then move right.  It looked like a light show.  They were very high so that is why I thought they were satallites at first.  This went on for about 3 min. The dance stopped and they seemed to blend back into the back ground of night stars.;40.56;-76.3237
