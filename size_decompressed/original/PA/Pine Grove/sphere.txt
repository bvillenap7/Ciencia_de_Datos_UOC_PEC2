As I sat and watched, something caught my attention off to the NW about 15 degrees above the horizon. It was a ball that looked similar to a star however larger. The object had several distinct lights on it, red, green, and white respectively. The lights flashed at irregular intervals as the object moved laterally left and right also irregularly. After about five minutes of trying to figure out what it was, the object shot straight up about 10 more degrees before moving right very abruptly and then shooting straight back down to its original position in the sky. I ran inside to alert my sister who came out and watched with me. For the next half hour or so, we watched the object move irregularly while trying to get the object focused in a telescope. Unfortunately the object was moving too irregularly to keep in frame and we had no more than three seconds at a time of view ! through the scope. It slowly began to fade away and we both thought that it was going to completely disappear however, it came back at a truly unbelievable speed to its original position where it stayed for another five minutes, moving hard left and hard right irregularly. Finally, the object seemed to go directly away from us very fast until completely out of view and this time it did not return.  We were both very very skeptical of any kind of alien or supernatural entities to say the least however, this experience has changed our minds considerably.  I am a Digital Forensics major going into my senior year. I have dealt with technology all my life and have always had an interest in the viewing of celestial events. I can honestly say I have never ever seen anything like this.;40.56;-76.3237
