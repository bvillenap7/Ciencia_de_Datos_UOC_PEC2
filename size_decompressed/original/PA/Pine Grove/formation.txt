We Never seen anything like this in our nearly 60 years.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-01 05:20:00;15 minutes;We Never seen anything like this in our  nearly 60 years. Started at 5:20 am to 5:30 am. Sky was clear.Able to see the stars etc. no problem. Objects came from South west and traveled Northeast.Traveled about the speed of the Space station when it crosses the sky.Could tell they were at a pretty high altitude but could easily see the light.  Not as bright as Venus,maybe the brightness of a star that was a little further away  .They all traveled the same path,but not together.First 2 came singly. Then a cluster of about 5.  Then another cluster of about 10+.  Then a cluster of about 7...Then a few stragglers of 1 each.The clusters were not in a straight line.Spread apart a bit.Never seen anything like it.Wondered if anyone else reported this or seen it. I've watched the news and Weather channel for a couple days.No reporting of it..Rural area.;40.56;-76.3237
