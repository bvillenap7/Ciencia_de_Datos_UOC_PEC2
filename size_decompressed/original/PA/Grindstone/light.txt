Large white object with a slight yellow tint seen being followed/chased by jets.;2012-04-23 22:21:00;2 minutes;large white object with a slight yellow tint seen being followed/chased by jets. I am located @ 40°1'20.8N by 79°51'6.1W. I was watching TV when a light from my window caught my eye.  The light was not like a normal airplane.  This light was solid white with a slight yellow tint.  It also had a slight twinkle to it.  It moved across the sky and would slow down then speed back up. I noticed behind the object was first 1 plane/jet then another.  Then another coming from another  the object.  They all seemed to be following or chasing this object.;40.0122;-79.8395
