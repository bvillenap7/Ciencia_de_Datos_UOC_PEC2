Circular object red blue and white lights spinning below power lines and below trees.;2004-08-04 21:00:00;15minutes;Circular object red blue and white lights spinning below power lines and below trees. Lights behind trees near power line, there was a luminous glow at the power line, there were red,blue and white lights, that were spinning and reflecting off of the mountain side at the power line, it stayed in the location for about 15 minutes, looking threw the trees from about 100 yards you could see it was a circular type of craft, but most of the view was obstructed from trees. When exploring the power line the next day the area where we saw the object, all of the grass had been singed, and black in color. The area that was singed was aproximently 30 yards/aproximently 13 days after the sighting there where strange looking hellicopters with different types of rods sticking out flying over the area about 10 feet above the treetops, I have photos of the singed grass and strange looking black and red hellicopters, that were unmarked. Also the light bulbs explode in our basement.;40.1742;-77.8729
