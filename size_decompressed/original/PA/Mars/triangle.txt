Hovering triangular object with 3 white lights and one red.;2020-05-26 22:30:00;1 minute;Hovering triangular object with 3 white lights and one red. I was driving eastbound down route 228 near the town of Mars PA. At first I saw three steady white lights horizontal to each other.  I commented to my passenger that was weird because in my experience airplane lighting does not look like that, there were no visible red or green wingtip lights or strobes.  I am a student pilot and I know what normal airplane lighting looks like.  As we drove I realized we were catching up to the object and that is was hovering in place around 1000 agl.  It was stationary over the woods to the left of the road.  As we got closer to underneath it I could see a red light toward the middle rear of the triangular object.  I thought it might be a drone at first but I have not seen any drones shaped like triangles.  We then drove past it and I lost sight of it.  I’m not 100% certain that what I saw is a ufo, but I honestly don’t know what else it could be.  If someone could explain that would be greatly appreciated;40.7003;-80.0351
