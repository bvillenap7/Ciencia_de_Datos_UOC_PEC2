Three orange lights in a triangle formation above the horizon in the Poconos.;2017-09-09 21:30:00;6 minutes approx.;Three orange lights in a triangle formation above the horizon in the Poconos. About thirty minutes ago, just before 9:30 p.m. I spotted three small round orange lights in the sky in upside down triangle formation (Two lights on top, one on bottom) near my home in Newfoundland, PA.   I was pulling off the main road onto my road and spotted the lights just above the tree line.  I drove downhill to the bottom of the road to follow the lights which were visible on and off through the trees and were moving southeast.  I lost sight of the lights at the dead end of the road.   Then I drove out onto route 447 north (as going south nothing would be visible due to tree cover) to see if I could spot them again.  I saw two of the three lights barely visible just above the horizon, for about 20 seconds before they disappeared.  There could have been some spotty cloud cover, so perhaps they just disappeared behind clouds, although the stars were visible when I was  back at my house.   Tobyhanna army depot is south of the area about 10 miles.  I donâ€™t know if this could somehow have been connected with that depot.   Witness is a ((specialty deleted--medical specialist)).;41.3052;-75.3353
