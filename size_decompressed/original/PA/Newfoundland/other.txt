So bright, could not decern if there was a definate shape.Moved at very slow rate. Watched it for 25 min, then it glided over our house, tree top level. NO noise. Silent. The inside of house lit up. There is much more to say. Would like to speak to someone about this. Also there where 3 helicopters involved. Makes my hair stand on end whenever I recall this incident.
