Bright blue object hovering in the sky.;2015-09-12 05:20:00;40;Bright blue object hovering in the sky. Started with my mom driving home from work.  She saw a bright blue object in this sky told me about it when we got home.  She tried taking pictures of the ufo and after she took them her iphone went dead despite having 50% battery.  When she plugged it in the pictures where changed after a brief charge the phone came back on at 53%.  After I heard this i told her go to a place where i can see it.  I brought my 20x80 binoculars and my dslr with a zoom lens.  I got five pictures before my mom wanted to leave since we where parked in a lot.  When I looked at it with my binoculars I saw a intense bright blue but i saw what looked like 2 sides. Just like the one one your site from 9/1 in PA.  My mom said she saw different colors, but she can't recall which. It did not move at all during this time despite being near sunrise I did not see no light reflection from the sun like planes have when they fly into the upper atmosphere, so this thing must of been far away, but low.;40.8545;-75.1683

One;2020-08-09 22:04:00;45 seconds;Single light [which I thought was a satellite] passing west of Altair moving north slowly towards Lacerta, split into two lights.  One traveling in the opposite direction towards Delphinus.  The light traveling north blinks out after 10 seconds.  The second moves in a erratic pattern, blinking out between Saturn and Jupiter.  Sighting lasted about 1 minute.  I have been using telescopes since 1974.  I have witnessed the space station, space shuttle and various satellites over the years.  This never happened before and I was compelled to record the event.  I was with my wife, who also witnessed the event.;40.8545;-75.1683
