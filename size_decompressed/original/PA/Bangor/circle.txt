Bangor, PA, light.;2015-06-16 22:40:00;2 minutes;Bangor, PA, light. A very bright round light moving quickly across the sky.  It was brighter then any plane and did not blink or flash.  Watched it for about 2 minutes, and then all of a sudden, it went higher into the sky and was very small then zoomed off up into the sky at a ridiculously fast speed.;40.8545;-75.1683
