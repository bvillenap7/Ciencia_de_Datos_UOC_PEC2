White light with two rows of red lights following behind.;2004-10-05 20:30:00;15 sec.;White light with two rows of red lights following behind. We were coming home from a school event and had stopped for a red light,at about 8:30 p. m. when we saw a white light followed by two rows of 5 red lights behind it.I rolled down the window but could hear no usual plane noise.  A guess to hight would be 1000 to 2000 ft.  The lights were moving East to West at the speed of an airplane about to land.  After about 15 sec they were blocked from view by trees, and had to move with traffic as the light had changed.  We live a few miles from the county airport and see lights of planes all the time,but this event has never come close to anything we have seen the 12 years we have lived here.  I hope someone else may have seen them and confirm our sighting.;39.9827999999999;-75.8239000000001
