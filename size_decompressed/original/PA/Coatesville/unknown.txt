Red Green and white flashing lights?;2009-11-22 18:00:00;still happening;Red Green and white flashing lights? My mom's boyfriend went out on our back porch to smoke about an hour ago after dinner, noticed something in the sky and after watching it for about 20 minutes we know it is not a plane, satilite, or anything any of us have ever seen, it looks like a big star flashing green, red, and white lights, it move slightly. we have it in our telescope. Plans went straight toward it and turned away.   IS ANYONE ELSE SEEING THIS?  Do you have an explanation? Thank you,        ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  The report is confusing to us.  The source indicates a time of 6:00, suggesting a morning sighting on Monday, November 23, but states that the sighting occurred ..after dinner.  Also, she fails to indicate the duration of the sighting.  We have no means of contacting the person, given that she provided no contact data.  We suspect that the witnesses may have been observing a twinkling star.   PD));39.9827999999999;-75.8239000000001
