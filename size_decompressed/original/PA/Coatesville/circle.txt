I was loking at jupiter through my telescope when a white dot came into view. I then pulled out of the telescope to see it. It travelled along from southeast to unknown. Across the sky it met up with another dot that cut right in front of the first. There were now  2 unknown dots a little after that they disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is anonymous.  The description is consistent with satellites, we believe, if the sighting was at night.  We have amended the time here to 8:00 p.m..  PD));39.9827999999999;-75.8239000000001
