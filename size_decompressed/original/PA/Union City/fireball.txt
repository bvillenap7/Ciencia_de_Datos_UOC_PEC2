4 balls of red light spotted.;2013-07-13 23:25:00;35 seconds;4 balls of red light spotted. While smoking a cigarette on July 13th, 2013 at approximately 11:25pm I noticed what appeared to be a burning ball of light in the sky. It flew from about south west to northwest of my position at a high rate of speed.  Once it had traveled to about west it began to diminish in brightness and pick up in speed.  At that point in time I had turned around to lock up my vehicle.   Once I finished I looked up in the sky and noticed two more balls of light flying in the same path with even greater speed.  They too diminished, however the second of the two continued a bit further until it too disappeared.  Confused about the situation I had finished my Cigarette.  Continuing to look into the sky with astonishment I had noticed one more was heading in the same direction.  This ball was more distant and vanished even more quickly than the others.;41.9193900990099;-79.6744316831685
