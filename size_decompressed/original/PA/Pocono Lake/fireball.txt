I was talking to a friend when I saw an orange ball of light travel in a direct line from my right to left.  It looked to be of lower altitude than a normal aircraft and travelled much faster, it then disappeared after  few seconds,  It was fast but not as fast as a meteor shower and looked nothing like  a meteor.;41.1225;-75.5548
