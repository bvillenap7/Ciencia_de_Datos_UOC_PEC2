Red/Orange lights over Pocono Lake, Pa.;2013-07-13 03:30:00;3 minutes;Red/Orange lights over Pocono Lake, Pa. When I saw this with my wife we both were stunned. We were both standing on my deck smoking cigarettes.  I saw 4 red lights. flying slow over the mountain in a straight line they were flying south to north and perfectly spaced apart from each other. I googled it and checked you tube later that day to see if anyone else saw it and nothing until I found this site. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
