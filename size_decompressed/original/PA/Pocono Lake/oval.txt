June 12, 2017.  8:45 PM. While fishing from a boat on a lake, I saw a  very long narrow streak of fire in the distant sky (almost like the fire shooting from a rocket ship in a 1950s science fiction movie).    At first I thought it might be a shooting star, but the sky was still bright and it did not look like it was moving.  I thought it might be a cloud reflecting a bright orange color in the setting sun light.   After observing it for about 30 seconds, I realized it was actually moving very slowly towards me (no sound).  It disappeared for a few seconds and then reappeared about few seconds later further to the right of where I first saw it and it was moving very slowly and going in the opposite direction from which I first observed it.  It slowly started to fade and eventually disappeared. Note:  The sky was very clear that night.  There were only a few small clouds visible.  I also considered that it might be a blimp but it appeared to be at too high an altitude than what I have seen blimps at.  The object seemed to be very far away from me.  That may explain why I could not hear any sound.;41.1225;-75.5548
