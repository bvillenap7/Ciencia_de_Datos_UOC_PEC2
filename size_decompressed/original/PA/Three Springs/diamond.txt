Craft hovered silently over top of ridge for 30 minutes. Diamond shaped with red,green, and white lights that were super bright. It then moved slowly northwest and disappeared. This is the third time that this has happened. There are three different witnesses that have seen this. We were standing either on the porch and in the driveway each time and live in a sparsely populated area with only a few neighbors in a mile 3/4 mile radius.;40.1867;-77.9924
