The UFO was a perfect blue oval.;2000-01-04 19:00:00;7-10 secs.;The UFO was a perfect blue oval. Iwas walking my dog around the firsst week of January 2000 at approximately 19:00.  It was dark, and suddenly, a streak of white light came from an eastern direction, and just stopped.  When it stopped, I saw an oval blue light I thought I was looking at dayllight in that oval, which was slightlly larger than the size of the moon.   It appeared to be about one block away and 100 feet high, and stayed there for about 5-7 seconds.  I tried to see if it were part of a larger craft, but could only see the oval surrounded by darkness.  It left just as suddenly as it appeared, in a streak of light, similar to the color of sodium streetlights.;41.3447;-75.7564
