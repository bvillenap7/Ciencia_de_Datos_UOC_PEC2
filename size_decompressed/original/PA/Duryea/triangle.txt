Triangle shaped UFO with a light on each side and blue and red smaller lights,;2011-11-26 19:00:00;5:00;Triangle shaped UFO with a light on each side and blue and red smaller lights, As i was driving on Ransom road in duryea, PA i noticed a craft with a blinking red light that was flying rather low in the air.  It was kinda weird to me seeing a plane that low so I thought i would keep driving towards it and maybe I could catch what it is.  When i caught up to the craft it was hovering a couple hundred feet above the ground just over the treetops and it was visible to me as clear as anything Ive ever seen.  It was a triangle shaped craft.  As i was staring at the craft i noticed the bottom of the craft had white lights at each end of the sides.  Also there was small red and blue lights in the middle of the bottom of the craft.  The craft appeared to be a shiny grey color and was motionless and no noise was emitted. After looking at the craft for a minute or two I drove away.  The size was not very large, a little larger than a small sized plane.
