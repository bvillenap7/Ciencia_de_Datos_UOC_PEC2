huge round black object with huge lights spotted in sky over Butler Co. PA;1996-06-15 19:00:00;10 min.bu;huge round black object with huge lights spotted in sky over Butler Co. PA This is so weird. I had just told my new husband of my seeing a UFO in 1996 when we decided to watch some tv and found a program on UFO's on the History Channel. Well, when it aired the report from a pilot over Pittsburgh I was screaming because I had just described the same thing to my husband! Please take me seriously - I was very disappointed that nobody had ever gotten back to me as I did report the sighting to the Post Gazette newspaper. What I witnessed was so amazing.  We were just driving along a rural road in my friends pick up truck - there was a light in the sky - we both saw it but didn't comment because we just assumed it was a plane - until a few minutes later when we realized the light had not moved! I remember commenting what in the world? at about the same time my companion came to the same realization that something just wasn't right. I am delighted to have this forum to report this to as I have thought about it so often during the years. Anyway, my friend just happened to have a pair of binoculars in his truck and told me to take a look at the light through them - which I did AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES!! Without the binoculars the light was just a light but with the binoculars it all became clear! My first response was Oh My God, Oh My God, Oh My God! I shouted for my friend to stop the truck - to pull over because I was dumbstruck! I was looking at the most magnificent sight - a huge round object with huge round lights - two of which were lit - the lights had what I called hoods over them - making them look like the hanging traffic lights. The lights would go off and I could see that they would come on at a different location on the object and then back to where I was looking. Tonight as I was trying to describe to my husband what I had witness I used the word energy - as in I could feel a great energy within this object - as though it were seething with power but I did not really feel frightened - just in awe. Well, as we watched the UFO program I saw where the pilot ! over Pit tsburgh described what he has seen as pulsating and I just had the chills as that would exactly describe what I had seen. The object was black - a very dull black and it was huge! I really could not tell how big it was until I realized that the lights were coming on on the other side of it and then I was able to ascertain that it was huge - it was blacking out a huge area of the sky! I could not imagine why more people had not reported seeing it but then I realized that without the binoculars it just looked like a light in the sky.  When I called the newspaper I was told nobody else had reported it. In the time it took me to hand the binoculars over to my friend it was gone - however, he did see the light earlier. So, this was my experience and now I am convinced that others saw it too - especially the pilot. I wish I could remember the month - I cannot and I had just told my husband that I was pretty sure it was 1996 and then I heard the pilot had seen one in 1996 and I am now convinced that I saw a UFO. Thank you for listening to my story. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));40.8692596153846;-79.9113423076924
Circular white object moving from north to south silently, at a high rate of speed.;2003-07-04 16:00:00;2 minutes;Circular white object moving from north to south silently, at a high rate of speed. My wife and I spotted a circular shaped bright white object moving at a rapid rate of speed from north to south.  It was underneath a thunderstorm cloud so it showed up very clearly.  It was not high enough to be a jet and it made no noise.  I am an instrument rated private pilot and am very familiar with common aircraft.  This was not a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft and was moving too fast to have been a ballon.;40.8692596153846;-79.9113423076924

There was a large saucer shaped object w/ white strobe lights going around it & a red flashing strobe light on the bottom.;2014-06-15 23:37:00;8 minutes;There was a large saucer shaped object w/ white strobe lights going around it & a red flashing strobe light on the bottom in the sky I was happy to find this site, I see UFO’s by my home and above it in Butler, PA, regularly. Ones with multicolored to plain orb ufo’s.  At 11:37pm on June 15th 2014.  There was a large saucer shaped object with white strobe lights going around it and a red flashing strobe type light on the bottom.   This is the second time in a week, I have seen this object fly over my house.  It seems to be going west to east or north west to south east.  The first time it was on a different time and day it was moving at a high rate of speed.  Yesterday on the 15th it was coming across my house in the sky.  I was standing on my deck watching it fly over, over by the tree line is a field.  I watched it moving across at a high speed the stop and just setting in the sky it sat there for a good 3 to 4 minutes, I quickly decided to grab my Canon T2i DSLR with 650-1300mm HD Lense  Just inside my french door.  I opened the door grabbed the camera turned around, it was gone, no trace in sight anywhere not a ! out of ordinary light anywhere in the sky to be seen other then stars..   I am on the look out for this object again.  For the distance it was in the sky to the scale of a normal airplane at the same distance in the sky, I would say this object was at least 6 times the same of a normal 747. On a nightly basis, I see ufo’s very high up the look like stairs move across the sky, sometimes they make a complete stop then start again and some make complete angle turns impossible for our known aircraft.  I photograph the moon a lot, I have not that I know of caught anything in my photos, but I keep attempting to photograph a UFO, it is my goal as a photographer to get one on film before i die.;40.8692596153846;-79.9113423076924
Mysterious glowing object.;2019-01-14 07:15:00;15 seconds;Mysterious glowing object On 1/14/2019 I stood outside to have my usual cigarette and coffee.  I looked up into the sky and saw a really bright star, possibly a planet.  Then I noticed 3 way smaller stars, 1 to the south, 1 to the east, 1 to the south east of the big star, essentially forming a rectangle.  I was thinking what a nice star formation.   While looking at the star to the east, I suddenly noticed a white/blue very bright constant light appear out of nowhere slightly to the left of the star..  I thought that it was a star that I overlooked at first until It started moving from left to right direction which startled me,  I observed it moving for about 15 seconds until it disappeared.  Even moved my glasses around because I thought I could be tripping, but the light was still there and moving.;40.8692596153846;-79.9113423076924
