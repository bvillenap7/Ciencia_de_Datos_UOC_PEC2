Bright cigar shaped object;2021-02-25 08:50:00;15 seconds;Bright cigar shaped object I live practically next door to Butler airport so I'm familiar with what small planes and Cessna aircraft look like.  I was traveling towards Cranberry Twp., PA, on a back road.  Clear, sunny morning with spaced out fluffy white clouds.  I witnessed a white cigar shaped object moving from my right to my left.  I did a double take because it was very bright white.  Not glowing, but a very shiny white almost like you had to squint to look at it but I could not make out any wings, tail, etc.  When I realized I couldn't make out it was a plane, I actually stopped the car in the road and object went into a cloud and I waited for it to reappear but it did not.  It happened quickly and at first I doubted what I saw but by the time I realized I was looking at something odd I couldn't grab my phone fast enough to record and it was gone.;40.8692596153846;-79.9113423076924
