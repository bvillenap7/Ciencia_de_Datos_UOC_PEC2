Fireball hovering in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Venus.  PD));2013-12-18 19:00:00;10 minutes;Fireball hovering in the sky I have been seeing this object for months.  It usually appears right below the tree line and slowly moves up. Then from there it will move side to side or up and down.  Then most of the time it slowly sinks below the tree line and disappears or it will simply dissolve and disappear. I tried looking at it with binoculars and it suddenly moved below the tree line and disappeared. It looks like a fire just sitting in the sky.;40.8692596153846;-79.9113423076924
