Huge black object with giant lights hovers over Pittsburgh.;1996-05-01 12:15:00;3 minutes;Huge black object with giant lights hovers over Pittsburgh. After watching a program on tv tonight I was compelled to tell my story. I never knew who to report what I had witnessed to - until now.  While driving on a secondary road with a friend we both noticed a bright light in the sky - at about the same instant we both commented that that plane had not moved.  My friend had binoculars in the car so I retrieved them to look at the light and was shocked at what I saw. It was a huge round jet blacl object with huge lights similar to traffic lights in that they had a sort of roof over each light. There were many lights but only two were on. I could see a sort of fog swirling around the light. I remember saying Oh my God - pull over. All I could say was Oh my God, Oh my God.  My friend pulled the car off the road and I was now looking at it through the passenger window. When I took the binoculars from my eyes all I could see was the light but with the binoculars the entire object was visible. It was silent and huge.  Of course I could not tell how close to me it was but it appeared bigger than a football field as it blackened out the whole sky.  When I turned away for a moment and then looked again the lights that were facing me were off and the lights on the back of the object were now on and looking in the opposite direction. By the time I handed the binoculars to my friend the object was gone.  I did contact the Pittsburgh newspaper and the Air National Guard and they just politely thanked me and told me nobody else had reported a sighting. I will never forget it.
