It was 8-12' above my head, moving about 3 miles an hour.  It looked like something you would see on the hood of a 1923 packard!  It looked like a JET, but the wings came STRAIGHT OUT and STRAIGHT BACK.  The wing tip's did not extend beyond the end of the craft, but fell short.  Further, There were NO rear flaps, and the entire craft was no more than 3' long. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
