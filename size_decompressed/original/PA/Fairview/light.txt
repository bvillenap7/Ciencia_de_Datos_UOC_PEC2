Around 9:15PM Sept. 1, 2012 my Friend and I saw what looked like a bright amber colored star fly from north to south at plane speed and altitude. Just before it would have gone out of sight, it appeared to slow down, dim twice and then disappeared. The whole thing took about a minute. It never changed color but did seem to get brighter and change shape at one point.  About 1 hour later my husband and I saw another one much farther north. Probably over the lake (Lake Erie). This one was amber colored  also, but it changed to red on and off. It was moving in the same direction as the first and at the same height and speed. There was no sound for either one.;42.0407;-80.2395
