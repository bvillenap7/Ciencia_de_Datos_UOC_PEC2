a bright light and no sound;2003-07-19 22:15:00;1:00;a bright light and no sound It was Saturday night and very clear and dry. I was out back stargazing with my telescope. I looked up to see a bright light approach out of the south. The object seemed low as if on a approach to land.  As I observed the object I did not hear any sound or see other lights. As it crossed my line of sight it went behind some trees and still appeared like a aircraft on approach. At this point seemed to be ascending off into the northeast. My vantage point  did not allow me to see the object after this point ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object may have been the ISS, but we cannot access www.heavens-above.com to confirm.  That site is down, for the moment.  PD));40.2162;-76.8663999999999
rows of bright lights in the sky;2006-01-12 19:00:00;1 minute;rows of bright lights in the sky It was dark- We were parking the car on the top of a hill so there was a clear view of the sky- we noticed these lights in the sky- at first I thought it was a fire work or something because of the brightness of it and the size of it- then I realized that I was looking at to straight paralell lines of round bright lights- then the two rows started going out at the same time - fist two then the second two and so on until they were all out- then we could see these very tiny bright white twinkleing lights that seemed to flutter around for about 30 seconds and then they dissapeared.;40.2162;-76.8663999999999
