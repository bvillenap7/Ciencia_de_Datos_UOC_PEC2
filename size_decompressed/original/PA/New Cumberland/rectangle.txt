Small to medium sized black rectangular shaped craft several years above the tree line.;1989-06-01 21:00:00;5 Minutes;Small to medium sized black rectangular shaped craft several years above the tree line. I was Sitting behind the elementary school on a road behind the school near a big hill and was watching the sky when I looked to the tree line and seen a rectangular/shoebox shaped craft move into view.  It had no wings/propellers/engine(s) and made no noise and was moving too slow for an aircraft. it had odd lights between 2 and 4 on front and on the rear of the craft and was solid black.  I watched it move overhead and follow a course toward the airport/Army Depot as it moved out of sight it turned sideways and continued on its path till it was out of sight in an easterly direction. This happened many years ago and date and time are best guess. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.2162;-76.8663999999999
