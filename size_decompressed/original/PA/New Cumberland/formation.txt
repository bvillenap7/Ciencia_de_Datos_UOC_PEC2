Formation of multiple orange objects;2019-11-23 20:35:00;5 minutes;Formation of multiple orange objects So I am driving on my way home and notice a orange colored object just near the cloud cover we had.  Further up the rosd around a bend there are now multiple orange colored objects in my line of sight.  At this point I am looking south where a corn field area gives you a view of Reesers Summit.  This is where these multiple objects seem to be rising from the top of the Summit.  I pulled off the road in a spot near the Pa. Turnpike and took some photos.  These objects all moved in the same direction which would be off to the north more or less. I would like to add they seemed to look a little bit likr Chinese lanterns. They all seemed to rise up into the cloud cover.;40.2162;-76.8663999999999
