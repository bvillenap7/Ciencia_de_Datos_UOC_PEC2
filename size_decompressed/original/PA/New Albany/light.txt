Small flashing star-like object, primrily white light with smaller red & green lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius would be in SW sky.  PD);2007-04-19 20:45:00;ongoing as of 21:25;Small flashing star-like object, primarily white light with smaller red and green lights. Singe object in southwestern sky initially noticed at 20:45.  Approximately 45 degrees above horizon and relatively stationary as of 21:18 had only fallen a few degrees towards the horizon.   Appeared as a fairly bright star approximating magnitude of Sirius, however was visibly flashing with hints of red and green.   Viewed through 4 telescope, very obvious red and green colors intermixed with predominant white light.  Appears to be quite distant - through scope, slightly smaller than pencil erasor.  No details visible, simply a flashing 'blob' of lights.  No sound at all.  Is very definitely not a commercial aircraft.   As of now, 21:25, has edged at most a few degrees slightly to the west-southwest, but still appears fairly stationary.  Very slight haze of bright light around object, pulsating slightly as the flashing (which is continuous and ongoing w/ seemingly no pattern) continues. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might be looking at Sirius.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));41.5983;-76.44
Appears to be bright star flashing with hints of red and green colors.;2007-04-24 21:00:00;2 hrs;Appears to be bright star flashing with hints of red and green colors. Please see exactly the same description from this location on 4/19/07.   We have been watching the same thing for five consecutive nights now, although last night (4/23) being overcast, it was not visible.   However, it is once more visible again tonight.  I will readily assume I am viewing a very bight star, especially given that it appears to remain stationary and passes from view while the earth moves as the night progresses, however why does it appear to be flashing with very noticeable colors of red and green?

Red, green, white flashing 'star' over central PA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter or Antares??  PD));2007-10-07 19:54:00;ongoing;Red, green, white flashing 'star' over central PA. We are witnessing exactly what we witnessed in our reports of 4/19/07 and 4/24/07.  SW sky, approx. 45 degrees above horizon.  Appears to be a star but with rapidly-flashing white, green and red lights.  These are not 'hints' of colors but very noticeable, definite colors.  Object completely stationary but as most leaves are still on trees here, I suspect as with the spring sightings it will slowly rotate out of sight.  No sound, no movement, appears very distant (i.e., in space, not in atmosphere).  See the 5/8 North Huntington and 6/5 Allentown reports.  I suspect we are all seeing the same thing.  I am near NY state border, so northwest of Allentown and NE of N. Huntington.  Perhaps this object is in sky between us, over central PA?  If this is a star, can somebody at NUFORC post an addendum and explain why the obvious colored lights?  Could it be atmospheric in some way?  This is just plain weird.
