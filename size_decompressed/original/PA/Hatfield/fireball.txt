Clearly visible fireball over Hatfield, PA.;2014-12-11 19:00:00;5 minutes;Clearly visible fireball over hatfield pa on a clear, cold night, I looked up and saw a bright yellow, orange fireball.  It was low enough that I could clearly make out flames coming out of it in a downward direction.  The best I could describe it, is a small, slow moving sun, about the size of a dime.  My immediate thought was a hot air balloon on fire, but soon realized that was not what I saw.   I had a full view of it for about 5 minutes.  As it was nearly out of my field of view, it seemed to extinguish, and reappear. I have pretty extensive experience from the Marines, of what is normal, and what isn't.  This was certainly a technology that I have never been exposed to.;40.2746;-75.302
