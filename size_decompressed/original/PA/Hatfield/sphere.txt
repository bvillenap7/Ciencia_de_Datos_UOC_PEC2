Red-orange glowing lights moving slowly across the sky.;2014-06-14 22:00:00;10 minutes;Red-orange glowing lights moving slowly across the sky. While walking into the store, my boyfriend and I noticed 4 lights moving across the sky.  At first we thought they may be planes or helicopters until we realized they were too low.   Then one of the lights stopped suddenly and dropped quickly towards the ground and out of sight.  We watched the other lights for a few minutes.  They appeared to be red-orange and almost looked as if they were glowing or on fire.   They were all traveling in the same direction, slowly, and moving upwards.  Before entering the store we saw 1 more light appear. We went into the store and when we left about 5 minutes later the lights were still there, just slightly further away.  We got in the car and planned to drive to the other side of the parking lot to get closer.  When we got across the parking lot the lights had already vanished.  We looked over to where we had seen them at first and we saw 1 more light appear and follow the same path.  I tried to take a video of the object on my phone but it did not show up well. The event was very strange, I could not come up with an explanation for what these lights were.  Even my boyfriend who is skeptical was baffled.;40.2746;-75.302
