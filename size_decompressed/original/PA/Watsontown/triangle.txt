The object was flying from north to south on Main St.  I saw object cutting through the lowering haze of the night. The object was of triangular shape, Transparent, With a light in the middle.  The object covered a lot of ground quickly with no sound.I was able to look directly under object and faintly see the stars. This area of Pennsylvania is an air traffic crossroads, the object was closer to the ground than the existing planes in the sky.  Almost as if flying under the radar.  No planes seemed to be effected by the object, although they were much higher then object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
