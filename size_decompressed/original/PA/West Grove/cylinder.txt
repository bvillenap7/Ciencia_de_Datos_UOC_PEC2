Observed 2 orange objects in the sky over my car while driving home from work. After making a turn onto another road, I observed 2 more orange objects for a total of 4 objects.I pulled off the road to watch the objects which seemed to be traveling in pairs, but  traveling the same route.  The first 2 objects I saw were closer and appeared to be translucent.  Continued watching until objects were no longer visible.  I did get a picture of 2 of the objects on my cell phone..;39.8242;-75.8334
