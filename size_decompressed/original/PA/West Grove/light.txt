West Grove PA 9/19/09 Chester County 19:50  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 19:50:00;2 minutes;West Grove PA 9/19/09 Chester County 19:50 A stationary white light, almost looked about as bright as a street light in the sky.  It seemed circular, there was no side to side movement, nor up or down.  I observed the light for about two minutes, and it faded once, and faded twice, at which point it was no longer visible.  The sky was clear tonite, i was in front of a blockbuster video in west grove pa, looking at an approximate 45 degree angle.  The object seemed relatively close to me, much closer than stars, and below the height that airplanes fly, and at a height i thought was close to that of a helicopter.
