Large Black Triangular Blinking Aircraft;2006-11-22 00:00:00;30-60 mintues;Large Black Triangular Blinking Aircraft It was around 11:30 last night and i saw blinking lights flashing threw my window.  I looked outside and this large triangular spacecraft went over my house.  It had white alternating blinking lights on the 3 sides and it seemed like 1 red blinking light underneath the aircraft.  It didn't seem like an Airforce carrier because it was too low and circled for an hour going in every different direction fast and slow.  There were other white blinking lights as if there were other unidentified aircrafts in the distance that seemed to be bouncing up and down like on a roller coaster.  It sounded like it had a big engine but it didnt shake the house when it flew over when usual aircrafts that land in Dover Downs, DE,  airport fly across my house.;39.8242;-75.8334
