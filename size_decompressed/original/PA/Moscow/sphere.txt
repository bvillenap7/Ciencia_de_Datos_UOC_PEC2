Metallic, sphere-shaped object briefly visible from car on I-380 South;2005-11-04 10:00:00;Approximately 10-15 secon;Metallic, sphere-shaped object briefly visible from car on I-380 South I was riding in a car with my family on I-380 South around Moscow, Pennsylvania at around 10:00AM on 4 November 2005.  I noticed the sphere-shaped craft appear to hover above the tree line in the distance and, after a moment, pointed it out to my father who was driving at the time.  When he looked up, it had disappeared.   It seemed to be metallic as the entire surface reflected the sunlight as a bright silver-white against the clear blue sky.;41.3462;-75.5327
