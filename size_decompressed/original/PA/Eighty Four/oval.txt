Possibly 3 all white objects spotted in washington county Pennsylvania;2018-09-29 18:00:00;10 minutes;Possibly 3 all white objects spotted in washington county Pennsylvania I was driving with my husband in the passenger seat and my mother in law in the back seat.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye an object in the sky.  I got everyones attention and we all looked while driving down the road.  I was driving so I couldn't look for long so my husband probably got the best veiw of it.  I noticed one at first.  It was all white. It had no flashing lights or any other colors.  At first it looked stationary but the longer we looked we could tell it was slowly moving.  After looking for a couple minutes I noticed an airplane directly above us and with that we compared the speed of the airplane to the unknown objects to verify our sighting.  When we were about 2 minutes from our house, I spotted another one, this could be a second object or it could be the same one from before.  This object we watched go behind this big black cloud and we spotted another one in unison with the one that disappeared into the clouds.  I've never witnessed anything like this in my life so that's how I knew it was strange and out of the ordinary.;40.1882;-80.0665
