I was ordering some Indian food outside the place on my phone... and looking up at the sky... just like normal thing!!  Suddenly, i saw this thing flying really fast.. above 10-15 stories high..!!  it came really fast.. and then there was a sudden spark witha tail of light behind that object for just 2 second.... but that tail was very short... just like something burn up at that spot and than that object went away without any tail.  Tail might be around 20-40 meters (including the height of the object from ground) of light and went away really quickly... really  really fast..!!  just like a lighting in thunder..!   it was 2 apartment big kind of stuff (aircraft or may be any object..!!)  i was thinking it of some sort of airplane... but it was way less than the height of any aircraft follows... and the size as well... the sky horizon was very broad to me... and it went away that fast that any aircraft can't go these days..!! this object was circular(disc shape) with looks...!! as  i saw it going to the horizon towards mill grove (Nearest place i know... may be towards King of Prussia mall).   I was thinking to take a pic or video of this thing... but couldn't..! it was really fast..!! if would have been an aircraft i could have done it really easily..!!;40.2073;-75.3609
