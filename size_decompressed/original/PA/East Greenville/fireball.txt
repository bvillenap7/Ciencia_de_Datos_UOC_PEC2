On July 7, 2010, at 9:45 pm, my family of six and I saw a bright red orb in the middle of the sky.  It was glowing and moving in a straight line SE to NW.  The orb started at an estimated 150 feet and moved to about 20 feet, when it disappeared below the tree line.  The orb moved in a very controlled manner, in a straight line on an angle towards the ground.  After the object disappeared below the tree line the glow disappeared and wasnâ€™t seen again.;40.4149;-75.502
