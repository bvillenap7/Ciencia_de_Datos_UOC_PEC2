Fast moving bright light stops dead, idles around - some time later viewed it slowly and randomly moving around.;2002-02-08 00:23:00;2+ hrs. (can still see it;Fast moving bright light stops dead, idles around - some time later viewed it slowly and randomly moving around. Being an ameture stargazer saw a realativly fast moving object (realitive to a plane or jet) and thought it was a satellite.  Much to my amazement the light stopped, at this point couldn't take my eyes off of it.  Others were in bed and was hesitant to wake them up just in case I was seeing things, continued to watch.  It was white lighted mostly, but would get very dimm and brighten up again.  It seemed to just be hovering with only slight movements X and Y.  It was very still outside with little wind.  After watching it for a bit decided to get a second optinion for another member of the household.  Not sure what that persons thoughts are at this time but I know what I saw. Still not totally convinced that I saw what I saw went in the house to warm up for about two hours or so and sat down on the same step and used the same reference points and there was not a star (not at all bright) anywhere close and knew that I had see something.  At this point scanned the sky and 45 degrees to the north of the position that saw the same type light.  Again sat to be in a stable position, got a non-moving point of reference and watched.  The same type bright and then almost dim to nothing type light and slow movements in different directions.;40.0428;-76.4286
Small changing light moving different directions.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a twinkling star??  PD));2013-11-21 22:40:00;2 minutes;Small changeing light moving different directions. For the second night out of three, I witnessed lights that changed colors from white to red and blue.   Moving up down sideways in the sky for two minutes.  It looked like a small flashing light.
