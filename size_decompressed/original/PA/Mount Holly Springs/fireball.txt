Only viewed for perhaps 5 to 7 seconds until it went out of view due to the house.  I ran outside but by then it had burned out. I suspect either space debris or meteor re-entering atmosphere, but was faster, closer, lower to horizon, brighter and with longer tail than any meteorite I've ever seen!  The size and brightness would seem to indicate it was relatively close to my location, however no sonic boom was heard.;40.113;-77.1865
