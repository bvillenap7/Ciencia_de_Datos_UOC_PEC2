Suddenly, a second object, brightly reflecting sunlight, closed rapidly behind the jet from the aft starboard quarter.  I lost visual of said object as I scrambled outside with my digital camera, and never reacquired a visual on the unknown.  I would estimate object in question was at about 1500 yards distance from jet aircraft when observed, and closed distance by approximately half in the short duration of the observed event.  Whatever it was, it was way too close to the jet aircraft for normal flight spacing parameter's for safety.  No contrail observed from unknown! Only additional information I can add is that the jet aircraft was in a Northwesterly heading at time of said event!  The unknown was in a more westerly heading during time of event, as if to intersect with the contrail a few hundred yards behind jet!  Unknown appeared to be highly reflective of sunlight, but no reflection or glare from sun was observed from airframe at same time of sighting/event.  Though I am in Cumberland County, I believe the event ocurred over Franklin County to my west.  This was my 2nd such sighting of this type in this same air corridor over the last year or so!  My last was seen from Boiling Springs, and in the same general viscinity/air corridor!;40.113;-77.1865
