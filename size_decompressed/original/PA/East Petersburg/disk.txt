Saucer shape but odd because all you could see was a white dotted outline of the object.  The lights  dully flashed in one direction, stopped for a moment and changed direction, clockwise and counterclockwise.  When it came over our vehicle you could only see the the bottom continuing the same moment. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness remains anonymous.  PD));40.1022;-76.3513
