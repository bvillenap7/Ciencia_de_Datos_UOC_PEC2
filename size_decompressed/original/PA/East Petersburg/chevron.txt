They turned abruptly and disappeared.  They were white and appeared cloudy looking.  They were shaped like boomerangs.  The sky was clear and crisp. The odd thing is though the whole time we were out this morning my dog was acting very skittish.  Kind of the way a dog gets during a thunder storm.  The sighting lasted approximately 10 seconds.;40.1022;-76.3513
