Last night my parents were having a new year’s party. All of us kids were bored so we decided to go for a walk. We decided to walk towards our friend’s house. He lives just about 5 minutes up the road from my house.  We didn’t feel like taking the road so we decided to take a short cut through the woods. It was pitch black out so we were using our friend’s cell phone for a light.  He had three bars of battery left and we knew we could make it. We were crossing the railroad bridge when we saw a glow in the middle of the woods.   As we got closer, our friend’s phone shut off! The battery had died and it would not turn back on. We kept walking towards the green light.  It kept getting closer and closer and moving back and forth across the woods.   It suddenly disappeared and we saw a shape glowing towards the sky.  We were all afraid and in tears so we headed back to my house. Once we got back we explained the story to the adults and they thought we were crazy.  We grabbed a camera and flashlights to see this time and to prove to the adults that we were not lying. Hoping it would still be there or come back, we headed back to where it was. Once we got across the bridge this time, the glow was hanging in the sky right above us. The flashlights began to flash on and off and then it was gone.  The flashlights went back to normal. We asked our friend to turn his phone on and see if it would work and sure enough he had three bars on his battery and it was back to normal.;40.9046;-79.5065
