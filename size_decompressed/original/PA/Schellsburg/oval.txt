The Mill Road area and saw this more round than oval bright light moving across the top of the hill by Mill Road.   It looked to be lower than most planes that go by here.  Usually they are small private planes or the airliners flying at 35,000 feet.  It seemed to pulse  than all of a sudden it looked like an after burner on a rocket light up and it took off really fast up in to the sky until it dissappeared.  It didn't look like no damned weather balloon or NORMAL aircraft to me.  Oh yes, it didn't make any noise either.;40.0465;-78.6526
Large bright light that was pulsating  traveling lower than airplanes and suddenly taken off at a tremendous speed.;2005-11-07 22:00:00;2 to 3 Minutes;Large bright light that was pulsating  traveling lower than airplanes and suddenly taken off at a tremendous speed. I was traveling on the road that crosses Shawnee Lake and stopped to use my cell.  I happened to be looking towarde the hills on the Mill Road area trying to see if I could see my friend's house on mill road, since the leaves are off you can see alot farther.   Well, up in the sky I see the big light about the size of the moon.  It was flying much lower than the smaller aircraft that fly over from the local airport.   The only commercial flights that go over are flying at a very high altitude.  It seemed to be pulsing light as it moved across the sky.  Then it seemed to stop and it looked like an afterburn on a rocket start up and it took off very fast and dissappeared.   What was really weird was that it made absolutely no sound.  Even with the higher altitude flying commercial flights you can hear them as they go by.  It sure didn't look like no weather balloon or normal plane to me.;40.0465;-78.6526
