It had no vapor trail as did the air plane, and it changed direction once or twice and then disappeared. There were no clouds for it to fly behind, just clear sky. the event lasted about 5 - 10 seconds. 30 seconds later it reappeared in a slightly different location behind its initial direction of movement, stayed stationary and vanished yet again. Object appeared for a third time and made several directional changes, no vapor trail again and vanished once again.;41.0798458646616;-75.1325353383458
