I watched it for about 30 seconds when I noticed that it was moving in a strange mannor. It would travel north then go back then turned towards me for about 1 minutes and at one point looked as iff it was coming down here. it then turn north west and disapeard into the sky line. It was a yellow whit color and did not look like ANY planes I see, i do see planes alot but NONE that look or moved like that.;41.0798458646616;-75.1325353383458
