Then I saw it again the same night. I was walking to my house after being dropped off from work when I heard a high pitch noise and I looked up at the sky and I saw the cigar shaped object fly across the sky and it had a extremely bright red light coming from it.  It was so bright that I had to look the other way and then when I looked back at it it started to stop and stay still in the sky.  Then all of a sudden it took off so fast that I didn't know what direction it went in.  That night I went to shut my blinds when I saw the bright light again and this time the light seemed to point at me and it seemed like it was getting closer and then I heard the loud noise again and it left and I never saw it again.;41.0798458646616;-75.1325353383458
