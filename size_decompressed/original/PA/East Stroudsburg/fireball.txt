I called my husband's attention to it- we thought was an aircraft moving across the sky.  But there was only one light, which was yellowish and looked like a ball of fire.  High in the atmosphere.  No sounds.  No wing lights to identify it as an aircraft.  It stayed at the same altitude passing silently overhead.   Another then appeared on the horizon, identical to the first.  Soon after followed a triangle of three lights.  Finally another single.   All were below the clouds, @ perhaps 10,000 - 15,000 ft. They traveled in the same direction, stayed on the same course, did not lose altitude.  Eventually they appeared to dim and almost burn out.  But stayed on course. The entire event took more than five minutes but less than ten.  It is a cold, dark night, approximately 8:30 pm EST. I'm not sure of direction, but I believe they were moving south to north. As the last object was disappearing, an actual aircraft flew overhead- easily identifiable by the normal lights and sound.  It did not appear to be chasing the objects, but it did reinforce how foreign the previous objects in the sky seemed. I took a few pictures with my I-phone.  They of course didn't capture what we saw very clearly, but they are all I have to share.;41.0798458646616;-75.1325353383458
