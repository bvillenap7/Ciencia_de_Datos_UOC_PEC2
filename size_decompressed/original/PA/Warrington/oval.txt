My sister, her two friends and I went outside to have a cig around 1am.  We were out there for about 5 min when this bright blueish green light lit up my sister's and I face.  We both qiuck looked up and saw this oval shaped object appear and zoom into the black sky it was only visable for about 2 secs.  Our two friends turned around as well but just that fast it was gone.  We have never seen anything like that before in our lives and so my sister came on this site to see if there was anything seen around where we live and there was.  They saw pretty much the exact same thing we did. It's crazy.;40.2449999999999;-75.1331
white oval light moving in strange inconsistent circular patterns;2017-10-06 19:40:00;1 hour;white oval light moving in strange inconsistent circular patterns Oval white light moving in random, inconsistent circular patterns.  It is not a spotlight, drone or aircraft.  Light levels in the area make it difficult for photos or videos to be taken of the event.  It has also been seen by a friend in Warminster.;40.2449999999999;-75.1331
