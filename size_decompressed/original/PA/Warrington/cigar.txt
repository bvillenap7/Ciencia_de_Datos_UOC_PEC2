What is in the sky after 9 pm in Warrington, PA?  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus.  PD)) ((anonymous report));2018-07-09 21:00:00;nightly, about 3 weeks;What is in the sky after 9 pm in Warrington, PA? Something has been appearing in the night sky between 9-10 pm, nightly less than a month.  It is stationary for awhile, then moves and becomes stationary again for awhile.  It seems to loop around full circle.  Could it be a Satellite? (It's positioned near Willow Grove Naval.)  It doesn't appear to be a star (too big, too bright, too close, and shaped oblong or cigar shape.);40.2449999999999;-75.1331

It's very bright, big, and close appearing near Willow Grove Naval station between Rt 611 and Bethlehem Pike or Old Rt 202.   It changes in shape from oval to triangle.  It hovers in place for awhile then moves a bit.  It disappeared after 11 pm only to show up in the sky, same place, again after 3 am (bathroom break).
