Blue light zooms across sky;2006-11-26 23:00:00;5 seconds;Blue light zooms across sky Me and my sister decided to go outback to have a cigaratte, so our two friends decided to follow us out.  We were standing out there talking and I saw a blue light relfecting off of me, thinking it was a firework or something I turned and looked up in the sky.  I saw this object go shooting across the sky faster than I've ever seen anything move and it was a distinct blue color.  I've seen a shooting star and meteorite before and it defintly didn't look like that, or just dissapear like that either.  My sister saw it too, and my other friends didn't turn in time but saw me completely lit up in a blue color.  I have no idea what I saw but it was one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.;40.2449999999999;-75.1331
Falling or landing ball of light over Home Depot in Warrington, PA, 9 pm at night.;2016-06-13 21:30:00;1 minute;Falling or landing ball of light over Home Depot in Warrington, PA, 9 pm at night. I was heading north on PA State Route 611 (Easton Road), approaching Street Road in Warrington, PA.  It was roughly 9, 9:30 PM.  Dark.  This is a highly populated area of big box stores that has either shopping centers or gas stations on all 4 corners.   As I approached the intersection with Street Road, I noticed a light “falling” from the sky, roughly above the area of where there is a Home Depot on the northwestern corner.  It fell relatively slowly, but steadily at a consistent speed.  It could have been “falling” or “landing”.  It was ball-shaped, and it was whitish light.  I could see no structure associated with it, just the light.  “What is that!?”, I said out loud to no one.   I stopped at the red light, and continued to observe it “falling” down.  Strangely, there were no other cars at the light with me, but going east/west and south there were.  It was very hard to determine size or what area it would hit, it could have been above the Home Depot, it could have been behind it, or it could have been a mile away.   The light disappeared behind buildings and the traffic light changed to green, and as much as I could as I continued driving north, I looked to the left to see if there was a smoke plume or anything when it landed, but nothing.  Continuing north, I heard no sirens, saw no speeding police cars or fire trucks.  This is a major artery.   I almost called the police, but decided not to.  I have driven this route every week night for 14 years around the same time of night, and have never seen anything like it.;40.2449999999999;-75.1331
