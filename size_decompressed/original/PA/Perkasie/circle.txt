Bright red light moving turns green moves radically then goes out.  ((anonymous report));2017-08-16 20:00:00;5 minutes;bright red light moving turns green moves radically then goes out. Approximately 8:45 pm, August 16, 2017.   Location  Perkasie Pennsylvania. Location Shadywood village.  I was sitting outside, enjoying the coolness of the evening with two other apartment dwellers.  By compass reading, I was looking 135 degrees to the south east above a small shopping center and the Bucks County Community College, upper campus, when I saw a very bright red light appear and moving in an easterly direction turned bright green and seem to stand still in the sky.  The light was a steady light.  Non-blinking.  It moved in front of a tree about 200 yd in front of me and was blocked for a moment.  Then still being green it slowly meandered on its seemingly easterly travel then made a upwards dart, via a straight line of travel.  Once again it turned red and it seemed to me to be moving more in a southerly direction.  It was at a low attitude so I thought but moved in a random zig zag for a short moment.  Then the light went out.  The lady's I was with seemed unimpr! essed but I know it had them going because it had me going and I was very vocal about it.  It was a very cool thing to have witnessed.  I did call the police but they showed little interest I recon they assume wackier old folks.  That's on them.  I have seen things before in the night skies  I will chalk this one up as very cool.
