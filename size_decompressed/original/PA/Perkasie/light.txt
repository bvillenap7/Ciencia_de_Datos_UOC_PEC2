Two yellowish/white light.;2019-03-12 06:50:00;5 minutes;Two yellowish/white light Two lights appeared in the sky while I was driving on route 152 from Crossroads Tavern to route 113.  They were hovering and not moving at all.  One was positioned at about 11 o'clock and the other at 6 o'clock.  They were bright and a yellowish color.  They did not move like airplanes.  They were not moving at all.  The one on top started to fade away as if it were moving away but the one on the bottom stayed where it was.  I turned left on route 113 and then an immediate right on route 152 (Walnut Street) hoping the bottom light was still there.  As I turned onto Walnut Street, the light on the bottom was completely gone.;40.3800000000001;-75.2718
