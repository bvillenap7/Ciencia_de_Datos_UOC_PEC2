Brilliant blue and red square shaped object massive size no sound vary low to the ground;2015-09-20 21:04:00;2 minutes;Brilliant blue and red square shaped object massive size no sound vary low to the ground Noticed a a flashing like out side of your living room area.  When I noticed it was flashing blue/red/white/purple.  I got up to try and get a better look of it outside the window.  I saw it south east it was moving East toward Pottstown direction.  When I got up to see a better look it had turned a white and moon type of yellow.  But too close to be the moon or any stare because it was moving through the trees.  Plus, the other witness that I was with say it first moving in the East direction.  I ran out side and at that point only could see the blue and red flashing light then lost it though the trees.  This object was low to the ground and to big to be a airplane or a helicopter.  I would guess that the object could have not bin more then 4 miles.  There was no sound just brilliant flashes of blue and red light.;40.2563;-75.8344000000001
