Five reddish/yellow parachute shaped objects in a moving formation.;2015-04-02 21:07:00;2 minutes;Five reddish/yellow parachute shaped objects in a moving formation. I was just lying down to sleep, when a reddish light caught my eye towards Reading.  It looked like a rocket launch in a way, and was heading towards the SW out of sight behind the section of my house obstructing my view.   I got out of bed quickly and ran outside to see what it was, upon exiting my house and looking towards where I had seen it,  I saw five!  They were moving kind of up and down and around in lazy movements maybe a mile or so away, three on the right side, one at a 10:00 aspect, the fifth down at a 6:00.  I called my wife to come out quickly to see them, and she joined me to watch.  They appeared somewhat like a parachute configuration, but not quite, and pulsing reddish/yellow in color and I heard no sound whatsoever. They expanded outward into what crossed my mind briefly resembled as a dipper constellation, then the three on the right side exited into cloud cover pretty quickly, one behind the other, the fourth and fifth exiting straight back from where they were positioned. The whole event lasted only probably about two minutes tops, but was very interesting and scary at the same time. I was in the Marines, have seen a lot of different terrestrial craft, have seen strange lights in the sky in the South Pacific, but nothing ever quite like this, and seemingly so close!  I am quite certain they were not Chinese lanterns or drones.;40.2563;-75.8344000000001
