Saw red light dipping behind treetops and backup again a few times;2020-09-05 22:00:00;10 minutes;Saw red light dipping behind treetops and backup again a few times My wife and I were having a fire in the backyard,  I looked up to the NE and saw a bright red light right above the treeline and we watched as it slowly dipped down through the trees.  I kept an eye on the area and saw it peak back up for a few moments two more times, then the next time it went back above the trees and then dropped low much quicker than before. I kept watching for more activity but never saw it again.  There were fireworks in the area, but none at this time, no sounds of drones or aircraft either.;40.2563;-75.8344000000001
