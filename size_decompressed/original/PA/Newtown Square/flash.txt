Flash Skips Across sky in Newtown Square, PA;2009-03-13 05:50:00;1 minute;Flash Skips Across sky in Newtown Square, PA 3-13-09 5:50am EST  Newtown Square, PA     Okay. Driving on my way to work this morning it was like every morning except not at all.  I was driving north on Route 252.  I was coming down the hill right before the damn at the Springton reservoir. Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I see a flash of light coming from my right.  The flash was turning on and off. The object was moving very fast. It almost seemed like it was skipping through the sky because its light was flashing on and off. It seemed like a white light with maybe a hint of blue to it. It zipped from way far off to my right across to my left. I was driving and trying to keep an eye on it as I was searching for it through the trees. As I was close to losing sight of it because I was not stopping my vehicle, I saw the craft hovering near the top of a nearby tower (possibly a cell phone tower) with its lights still flashing. It was the craziest thing I have ever seen. After I saw it my hands were shaking.;39.9817;-75.4072000000001
