I arrived at work tonight, at 5 minutes to 11PM.  While walking towards the lobby doors, a greenish, white fireball, approximately a mile away, skimmed the tree line and disapeared behind the 3 story building I was to work in.  The object moved in a west, by northwest, fashion, very slowly, and emitted a phosphurous glow, changing from white to green and back to white again.  It trailed sparks and illuminated the space around itself. It being september 11th, I thought for a moment it might be a missle, or a distressed plane, but after waiting for 30 seconds or so, and hearing no explosion or impact, I went in to tell the other guards what I'd seen.   I was so excited, I called my mother, as I knew she was the only one up at that hour.  She immediately googled meteor and Newtown Square and up pops this web site and a report of the very same thing I saw tonight, only 41 years in the past.   Spooky to say the least.   I'm writing this very moment in the lobby over which I saw the object, looking out over the same horizon.;39.9817;-75.4072000000001
