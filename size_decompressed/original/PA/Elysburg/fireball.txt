Fireball;2002-07-04 17:00:00;5 seconds;Fireball The object viewed was about 10 feet in diameter and was a light green color with streaks of yellow trailing behind. my wife and i where at Knobels Park when the sighting took place. We thought it was some type of big fireworks that had gone off accross the tree tops. But it was to big to be fireworks. The next day we read in the paper that a meteor had hit somewhere in New York and so we left it at that. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.8608;-76.5562
