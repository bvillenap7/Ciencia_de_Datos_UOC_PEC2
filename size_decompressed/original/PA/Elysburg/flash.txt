We witnessed this in parking lot of large theme park when leaving. Lights were pointed out to everyone by parking security guards.  Lights were witnessed by many people (more than 10) and was not part of any of the parks entertainment as at this time the park was closing. Myself and the group of people I was with observed the lights flashing and motionless for at least 5 minutes. We stood looking up in amazement.  I then continued loading our vehicle. When finished (Approximatly 5 min) I looked again.  Only one light remained. Lights did not move, just flashed.  Don't know if this was just a freak star type thing, or what the lights could have been.;40.8608;-76.5562
