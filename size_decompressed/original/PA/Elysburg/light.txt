My husband, a friend, our two kids and I were walking with the end of the day crowd at Knoebel's Amusement Park back to the parking lot.  We were looking up towards Jupiter, as it was really bright and the sky was so clear.  All of a sudden, to the right of the bright planet, there came this light that looked like it came through a cloud, but there was not a cloud in the sky.  It's hard to describe.  It got brighter and then a cone of white light shone downwards.  The cone of light was hazy as if there were a fog, but there was no fog or clouds.  It was a completely clear sky.  It traveled along towards us slowly and then slowly faded away.  The total time visible was 30 seconds.  Unfortunately, I did not get a picture of the object.  We were not the only ones who saw it.  The people walking next to us were gasping amongst themselves about it.  We walked further into the parking lot and the parking attendants were chatting on their radios about it.  The one man even asked me if I saw it and asked me to confirm on the radio what he was saying to the one other who hadn't seen it.  It was the strangest thing any of us had ever seen and we spent a long time trying to think of plausible explanations for it, but couldn't.  The way it moved, how it appeared, no engine sound (helicopter or jet)-- nothing we could offer up for an explanation was valid. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.8608;-76.5562
