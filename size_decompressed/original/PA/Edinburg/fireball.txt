A single strange redish-orange light in the sky.;2011-01-06 05:27:00;at least 30 min;A single strange redish-orange light in the sky. At 5:27 AM EST I went outside to start the car for my fiance whilst he was getting ready for work.  I looked up as I was unlocking the car and above the treeline to the southeast of my location I saw a reddish orange light in the sky.  It looked about the size of a golf ball from where I stood.  The light was a bit dimmed due to cloud cover. I watched it for about a minute, it appeared to go back and forth between wobbling and ascending and descending.  I went back in the house to grab my digital camera to attempt to take video but the cloud cover made it too dim to register on the camera. A bit after my fiance left I decided to go back out and try again to record it if it were still there.  This was at 6:02AM. It was still hovering in the sky around the same area as before but the clouds were still too thick to get a video of it.  When I went back out at 7:55 AM to take my son to the bus nothing appeared in that area. There is an army base about 6 miles from my home, they do not have aircraft there so I do not think it was from there.;41.0265;-80.4679
