8-10 orange lights/orbs.;2017-07-08 22:15:00;20 miniutes;8-10 orange lights/orbs On Saturday night July 8th, 2017, my husband and I witness at least 8-10 orange orbs. We have a limited view of the sky due to the trees in our neighborhood.  I saw them first.  The first two very close together and I wonder why 2 planes would be flying that close together.  They were very bright orange.  You know how a small plane looks when it is flying towards you.  Like that, only bigger and brighter and orange.   They were not moving towards us.  But from north to south.  When I saw the 4th one, I said to my husband what is that.  He jumped up from his seat and said, “I do not know”.   We moved off the porch and into the yard and saw at least 4 more.  He says no planes or helicopters have orange lights.  Way too high to be fireworks.  No noise.  We don’t know what we saw.  He is a ufo believer.  Me, I don’t want to know. This happened in Edinburgh, PA looking west toward Ohio.  10:15pm to 10:35pm;41.0265;-80.4679
