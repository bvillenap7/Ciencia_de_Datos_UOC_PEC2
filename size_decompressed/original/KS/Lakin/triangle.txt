In Lakin, there is a usual flight path I became familiar with between the Air Force bases in Colorado Springs and Wichita...  On this particular evening I was in the basement when I felt a low rumble, I dismissed it at first thinking it was just a passing jet, but when it continued past a minute or so, I went upstairs to investigate.  I had personally seen and heard of many strange things from the farm kids around town, but I had never seen anything like this.  It was a sort of triangular shaped craft that didn't appear to be more than 50 feet above the roof line of houses, and hovered with quite a bit of force exerted on the ground, yet with little sound (if that makes sense when written).  I watched the object for another 20-45 seconds hover, or slowly advance, and then it left extrememly quickly out of sight, not up to space, but straight along the plains towards Garden City.  As I have said, I had watched the aircraft on the flight plan since I was 7, and have never seen an aircraft behave like this, Perhaps this is an undiscovered hotspot?  It makes sense to me in the fact that Western Kansas has little population and most people are on farmers' hours (early to bed, early to rise) after 10pm, life all but ceases to exist.  Also, with a large stretch of flat lands and hardly anything above a two story building, it would be easy to move low to the ground and avoid radar.  Something to check out perhaps?;37.9392;-101.2668
