I get to my backyard something caught my eye.  Large craft fairly low I'm guessing 1500 ft.  Triangular in shape was very large with three  white lights at each tip.  There was minimal sound was like a low humming noise.   Ran  inside to get  binoculars by  the time I got back outside I could barely see the craft heading to the West.  Craziest thing I have ever witnessed.;37.9392;-101.2668
