Moved very steadily, taking about 10 minutes to move across a very clear moonless night sky.  Much lower than a jet liner and no blinking lights of any kind.  No air traffic at that time about 1 hour after sunset. On September 24, 2011 I saw the same brilliant light about 1 hour after sunset – same trajectory.  No air traffic, moon not up yet.  This time though, about ¾ of the way across my viewing area the light switched off and then there was a very small, faint reddish light continuing on for about 5 more seconds and then it blinked out also.  I was talking to a friend on my phone at the time and was telling her what I was seeing.  Just moments after the light went out the first air traffic I had seen all evening appeared heading nearly due east, from lights and altitude this would have been a jet liner. Will be checking every Saturday night when possible – will report if seen again. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite or ISS??  PD));37.9392;-101.2668
