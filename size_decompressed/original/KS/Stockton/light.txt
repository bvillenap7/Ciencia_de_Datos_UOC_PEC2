30 objects in an hour.;2007-05-09 22:00:00;3 days;30 objects in an hour. We began seeing these objects in the stars on the 9th and have appeared in the sky in the same manor till today on the 11th. They appear to be stars, but they move around. They fly straight at times and other times in lurching motions. They can be dim in light or very bright--brighter than the stars. We saw 30 in an hour on the first night. I tried to video tape them, but my video camera wouldn't pick them up. On the second night, we counted 40 in two hours and they didn't seem to stop, they just kept on coming across the sky. We did notice an anomaly with the sightings. We could almost predict when one was coming because it became very still, there would be no breeze, then we would hear a slight whoosh sound and a falling star would fall. Then a few more would come across the sky. The secound night I caught a split second of one on my video camera because it was so bright that it was blinding if you looked at it. We even saw one change course to chase a plane in the sky. This was a very strange thing for us to witness, we felt like we where being invaded and will probably see more tonight. Maybe these are just sattelites, but we dont think that is the case. We also see 2-3 white cigar shaped objects during the day, that appear to be incorperated into the seeding programs in our area. We don't know what they are, but hopfully others are seeing them in kansas. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));39.4358;-99.2873
