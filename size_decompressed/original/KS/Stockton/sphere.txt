commercial plane veeres off course to avoid possible collision with ufo;2006-06-23 22:00:00;30 seconds;commercial plane veeres off course to avoid possible collision with ufo I was unloading some material off my work trailer and looking up as i do alot now after having seen several ufos in the past three years or so,but this is my first report. I have many commercial aircraft that flies overhead, that night wasnt any different.A large airplane fliing a northeasterly heading had a bright shiny object rapidly approaching from behind it maybe a mile or so and slightly to the planes south side as the object approached to nearly along side the airplane,it veered to a due north course and the object stayed on the northeasterly heading until it went out of sight or dissappeared,was unable to locate plane as to whether it stayed on a new coarse or back to a northeasterly heading;39.4358;-99.2873
