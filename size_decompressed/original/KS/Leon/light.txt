Lights, starting from one , going to three, whole event 5-6 minutes. Clear nite E. of Wichita Kansas;2006-03-13 21:00:00;8-10 min.;Lights, starting from one , going to three, whole event 5-6 minutes. Clear nite E. of Wichita Kansas My wife and I were driving east on 400 highway coming from Wichita traveling to Leon.  Approximately 4 to 5 miles from Leon I noticed a light in the sky that was lower then a star and that kept going out then appearing again.  At first I thought it might be a planes landing light that went out when turning, but this light would go out and then reappear in no time at all.  I kept watching it and about 2 miles from Leon I told my wife to watch the light.  She looked up and saw the light and a second light appeared. The lights stayed lit for about 10 to 15 seconds and faded out one at a time.  Within 10 seconds, three lights appeared and stayed on again for about 10 seconds and unlike the two that fade out, the three lights went out abruptly and did not reappear. I would say that they were about 500 to 600 feet up. I would also say that putting your hand out in front of you palm extended that you would have had to turn your hand sideways to cover the lights.  Also, the lights were white, and the three lights had a little arch to them.  It was awesome!;37.6823;-96.7574
