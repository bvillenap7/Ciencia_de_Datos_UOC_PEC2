On 1/09/07, my fiancee and I were returning from the grocery store in our small town.  Less than one block from our home, we turned off the side street and something caught our eye at the same instant.   I was sitting in the passenger seat of our pick-up truck and saw three large yellow-orange lights that appeared directly over several homes in our neighborhood.  The lights made a perfect large triangle shape.  They appeared to be just below the treeline.  From the angle I was viewing, I could see the lights (very orb like and very bright, but they were constant and shining straight down and not rotating). The object seemed to just hover right below the treeline. I could barely make out a rough outline of a large dark triangular craft. I would say the craft was about the size of two small homes, but I could not judge it's height.  Just as I saw it, my fiancee asked, Do you see what I see?  I asked him what he saw.  He said he saw three bright lights shaped in a triangular form and as soon as he said this, the object disapppeared, just seemed to be gone.  We could not believe what we had seen, and when we got home, I immediately asked him to draw on paper the shape of the lights and told him I would do the same.  Our drawings were identical.  However, he said he could not make out anything but the lights but that it did just disappear.   My fiancee's truck window was slightly down and there was absolutely no noise.  This was on a clear night.  We live near Wichita, KS where there is a large airport and many flights cross our skies, but my fiancee and I have never seen an airplane with a triangluar form and lights that hovered and then as quickly disappear, with no sound at all.;37.8199;-96.846
