Three strange disappearing lights outside of Towanda/El Dorado, Kansas.;2016-02-24 19:00:00;10 minutes;Three strange disappearing lights outside of Towanda/El Dorado Kansas A friend and I were headed north on Highway 254 towards El Dorado, when I had seen an orange and a white light that looked odd. I looked back at the road and up again and they were gone.   Shrugged it off as a plane, but I still had went to the extent off calling my husband about it.   About 5 min later I seen them again, this time there was three.  A tiny white sparkle of light a orange light slightly bigger and another orange light a few times the size of the other all hovering together but they were all jumping around each other for a good 30 seconds and one by one they zipped off.;37.8199;-96.846
