Three craft with bright red rectangular lights in body and a large floodlight in front hovering above Kansas highway.;2009-08-09 23:00:00;1 minute;Three craft with bright red rectangular lights in body and a large floodlight in front hovering above Kansas highway. Three identical objects the size of a large jet fighter. Each were brightly lit with a large bright red rectangluar display in the body of the teardrop/triangular shaped craft. Each of the three craft had 1 giant floodlight near the front center of the craft. (From a distance, all you could see were three bright glowing red rectangles with a floodlight in front. They hovered approx. 300 ft above the highway in a uniformly crosswise fashion. Very scary. As I approached within a thousand ft. of them they turned their floodlights off, and raced to the west at an unbelieveable speed and disappeared. I will be monitoring the Wichita Eagle newspaper for any possible missing persons report. This is all I want to say now.;37.8199;-96.846
