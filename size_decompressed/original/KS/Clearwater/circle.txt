I was on my way to work and it was still dark outside.  As I pulled onto the paved road, I saw a huge circle of amber light rays coming straight down from the sky northeast of my location.  The origin of the rays was circular about the size of approximately 3 to 4 baseball stadiums.  It appeared to have lots of small circles of lights which emitted the rays of light coming down towards the ground.  They didnâ€™t appear to hit the ground however.  My first inclination was to justify something so out of the ordinary, by telling myself it must be the sun shining through the clouds but it was still dark and in the wrong direction for sunrise not to mention it did not move nor was it time for sunrise.  I sat and took pictures of it for approximately 15 minutes and as the sky lit up with the sunrise, the ray emitting object stayed stationary and the rays faded with the morning light.;37.5046;-97.5153
