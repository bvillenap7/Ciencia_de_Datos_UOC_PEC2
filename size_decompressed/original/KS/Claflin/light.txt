Cluster of yellow lights over Holyrood Kansas;2005-03-08 19:30:00;50 min;Cluster of yellow lights over Holyrood Kansas Driving home from claflin, I and everyone in my van saw a cluster of bright medium-yellow lights to the North-East (over or beyond Holyrood, Ks). There was a slight haze (maybe reflected light off of clouds) around the lights. My first impression was fireworks or flares of some kind, however, these lights were hovering, and not falling, (like flares) or extinguishing (like fireworks). The large cluster was visible for about 2 miles (driving at 45mph), then were cut off from view by a shelter belt.  After passing said shelter belt, three were still visible. We then drove towards the holyrood area just to gawk. (Hey, it was interesting OK?) The size of the lights never seemed to change, though after six miles, perspective demonstrated the lights to be over 300 feet in the air. Only two were visible at this point, and much higher than the red warning light on Holyrood's grain elevator, and possibly at great distance, since they seemed to stay in a given area thought the red lights postion changed with distance our vehicle traversed.  These two remained until 10 to 15 minutes after we returned home (three more miles). I do not know or claim as what they were, as I just saw hovering lights. However, the color was wrong for any type of aircraft searchlight (second though I had) or aircraft designator or landing lights (third thought).;38.5445;-98.5388
