I am on a business trip in northern Kansas.  The weather has been stormy.   As I was watching the long stretch of Hwy 36 in front of me, between Smith Center and Lebanon, there was this disk of yellow light that appeared to almost fly into my windshield.  It was as if someone had thrown a glowing Frisbee at my car.  It came at a diagonal angle and flew up and over the hood and windshield on the driver side, inches from the car.   I was going about 70 miles per hour, so it happened really fast.  I even ducked because I thought it might hit me.  It was about 5-7 inches in diameter, and appeared to be a disk, although it could have been more spherical.  It was as if it was made of yellow light.   A couple of miles down the road, there were smoldering remains of a barn or large building that had just burned down.   There was no sign of any other people anywhere around it, so I thought them odd coincidences.;39.8077;-98.7818
