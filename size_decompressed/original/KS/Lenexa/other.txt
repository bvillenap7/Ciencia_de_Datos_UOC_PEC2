Several clusters of lights crossing low over head that made No sound.;1990-05-26 23:15:00;8-10min;Several clusters of lights crossing low over head that made No sound. I was watching Tv one night when I heard what I thought was a car alarm going off. Then I noticed it sounded like the alarm was coming closer, so I stepped out onto my balcony of the second floor of my apt. The alarm was still going off, I happened to look up and noticed several white lights, which were in four different clusters. The first cluster had four lights on it in a diamond shape as if the lights were at the 12-3-6and9 like a clock would be, moving slowly from southwest to northeast direction. The second cluster had only three lights, moving in the same direction, but the third cluster had four lights all moving together but rotating on an axis, in a counterclockwise fashion. The fourth cluster only had three lights, but it was a little different then the rest, because as it went over the highway it rotated slightly, and it reflected the orange highway lights from below. But it then appeared to have a single light in the middle of the triangle, It looked as if it might have been silver, it was the only one that I could tell that was solid. These crafts were about 500-800feet up.There was no sound at all as these things went over head, because by this time the alarms had stopped. It was a clear night I could see many stars, except in the middle of these clusters of lights. I have seenmany aircrafts and helicopters and this was like nothing I had ever seen. I don`t know if there was a full moon or not. I have been asked that before. There was a witness, he was the security guard at the apt. complex. He was outside looking for what was causing the alarms to go off. I reported this to a ufo network and was given several names, one of an aeronautical engineer, and one of a director of the network, who came to my house and even hypnotised me to verify my story.The Hypnosis session was recorded on tape. So he may still have them. I have names which can be gotten from me at request. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.9521653846159;-94.739353846155

On the morning of December 23, 2005 on a Friday morning at 7:45 A.M. I was sitting out on my deck and I saw something move across the sky it was a bottle shaped object it had metal all around it and it just kept on going and going it was about 15,000 feet up in the sky. I saw it way up over the trees it got over a cloud and when it came out I saw it again and then it just kept on going and I didn't see it no more and it was gone. I was sitting on my deck drinking a coke when I saw this thing it was fairly clear but partly cloudy. I don't know what this object was that I saw. It wasn't a plane or a weather balloon or a star in the sky. I don't know where it came from but I saw it move in the sky.;38.9521653846159;-94.739353846155
