What appears to be a very high, orange-like star or satellite moving across the heavens suddenly stops in its tracks.;2000-08-28 22:15:00;10 minutes;What appears to be a very high, orange-like star or satellite moving across the heavens suddenly stops in its tracks. Two friends and I were standing in my driveway talking when I noticed what looked like a satellite crossing overhead, moving north to south, slightly orange in color and about 30 degrees east of being directly overhead. I directed their attention to the object...it was very very high and moving across the sky at a speed appearing to be consistant with that of a satellite, which we know to be around 18,0000 mph. We observed this object for 2 or 3 minutes until a very unusual thing happened...it appeared to suddenly stop dead in its tracks and then remained basically stationary in the same position for approximately 10 more minutes. It gradually faded from sight, perhaps moving directly away from us and fading with distance. There is no satellite that I know of that can come to a sudden stop. Far far too high for any helicopter. I was a helicopter avionics mechanic in Viet Nam so I know that it was nothing of that nature. When it happened, We all exclaimed at the same time...It just stopped! ((NUFORC Note:  We agree that it is very unusual for a satellite to stop.  We do not know what the witnesses could have observed.  PD));38.9521653846159;-94.739353846155
Bright light belived to be a comet or metior.;2001-12-08 17:45:00;7 min;Bright light belived to be a comet or metior. a bright light. it looked like a star except it was moving quite fast. it wasn't an airplane because we heard no engines. We belive that the craft soon crashed when it was out of our site. we were on a hill and it went below a house and we thought it had crashed. it wasn't a satilite because it was to bright and it wasn't a star because it moved to fast. the only thing that we could come up with is that it was a comet or metior. It was very clear night and just after sundown.;38.9521653846159;-94.739353846155
A blue light that fell out of the sky.;2006-03-15 23:00:00;5 seconds;A blue light that fell out of the sky. I was leaving my friend's neighborhood to head home around 11 pm. I was driving north and turning to go west. I stopped at the stop sign that allowed me to turn west, and was about to turn when I saw this little blue light falling from the sky. For a second, I thought it was a star, it looked like one would look like at a distance, but I definetly knew it wasn't a star. I froze and freaked out at the same time. I waited until I saw it land. Fear got the best of me and I zoomed off as soon as it landed.;38.9521653846159;-94.739353846155

It was a bright lime green type of color and it was faster than an airplane but slower than an meteor so you could see it really well and after like 6 seconds it just disappeared.;38.9521653846159;-94.739353846155

Seemingly endless stream of equally spaced lights traveling across the night sky.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-01 19:30:00;5 minutes or more.;Seemingly endless stream of equally spaced lights traveling across the night sky. On 2/1/2020, early evening, I saw a string of lights moving across the night sky. It was between 7:00 and 8:00 PM. Close to 7:30.  Lenexa, Kansas 66219 was the location. The lights were equidistant apart and traveling in the same line. Same speed. The speed never increased or decreased. The lights were seemingly not going to end. It felt like over 5 minutes. It kept on for a long time. They made no noise and were of equal brightness. They traveled north to south. From straight up, they were possibly 25 degrees west of straight up. They were possibly 10 degrees apart.  Not quite the width of my outstretched fist.;38.9521653846159;-94.739353846155
