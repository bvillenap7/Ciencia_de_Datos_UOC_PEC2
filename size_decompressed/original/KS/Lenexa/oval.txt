Fast oval shape with red light at the back, going north.;2012-07-04 21:32:00;5-7 seconds;Fast oval shape with red light at the back, going north. We were leaving a family members house and about to get in the car, looking at fireworks because the fourth of July and there is a light coming from the south-west.  It came really fast, going faster than      60 mph. it had a headlight on at first but it turned off around half-way through.  The shape was oval-ish  (sorry can’t find how to spell that) and had a one red light at the end.  It was going parallel to K-7. During this whole thing there was no noise.  So it could not be a jet. It was also very low. Lower than the airplanes. The red light was bright. It was brighter than a normal helicopter’s tail-fins light, and no helicopter blades.  One of my family members does not believe in UFOs and said it was a “weather balloon.”  It was nothing like a weather balloon. Thanks for reading!  :);38.9521653846159;-94.739353846155
