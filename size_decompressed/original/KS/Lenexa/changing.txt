Rainbow like flashing object that was stationary in the sky;2020-11-28 23:35:00;1.5 hours;Rainbow like flashing object that was stationary in the sky Went to the living room to turn off lights and looked out the window, noticed a very bright light. Appeared too bright to be a start, looked on Google sky map, didn't see anything that matched. The wife and I filmed this for about an hour, between 11:30pm and 12:30am. We have multiple videos from 2 different phones and vantage points.  https://youtu.be/JF15QeC_oqw;38.9521653846159;-94.739353846155
