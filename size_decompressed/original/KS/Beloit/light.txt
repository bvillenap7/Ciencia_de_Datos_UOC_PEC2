light with no aircraft beacons;2009-06-22 05:20:00;5 minutes;light with no aircraft beacons I walked outside approx. 5:20 am and watched as what I thought was a planet (where Venus or Mars usually is in the southwest) move overhead to the Northeast.  No blinking lights that a normal aircraft would have.  It moved slow at first, then picked up speed as it got directly overhead.  I could see it pretty plainly for a while as it got farther away.  It didnâ€™t get dimmer, only smaller.;39.438;-98.124
