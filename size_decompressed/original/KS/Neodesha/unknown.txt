Well, I was at a friend's birthday party/sleepover and we were playing hide and go seek in the dark.  Almost everyone got to the front porch (that's where our base was) and we were just talking and we saw what we thought was an airplane.  All we could see were a few red and blue lights.  Then suddenly the aircraft stoped and stayed in one spot for maybe 10 seconds.  Then it just took off in the opposite direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.4251;-95.6737
