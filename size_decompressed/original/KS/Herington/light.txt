Light hovering southeast of Herington, KS;2020-11-01 00:30:00;Ongoing;Light hovering southeast of Herington, KS While walking my dogs, I (for a second time in 8 months), saw a bright light in the sky. Months ago I saw it Northwest of Herington and tonight the same type of light was observed SouthEast of Herington (opposite side of town). It is decently far away (not close) and at approximately 45-50 degree angle upward from my point of view. The sky was very clear with close to a full moon. Temperature was chilly (40*) with a slight breeze. The light, observed via eye and through field glasses, flashed white with reddish and blue hues. It did not travel and hovered in place. There was no observable sound(s). I am familiar with helicopter aircraft, both military and civilian, which I am sure it is neither.;38.6766;-96.896
