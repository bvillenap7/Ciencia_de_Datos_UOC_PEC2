Strange satellite pulsing light.;2015-10-04 23:05:00;1 minute;Strange satellite pulsing light I saw a small flash of white light in my peripheral.  I looked up saw a tiny faint white light slowly moving directly east.  Similar to watching a satellite straying across the sky.  Object flashed a brilliant white light 3 more times, each about 5 seconds in between.  Note a small/faint meteorite streaked across same vicinity of object moving south during event.  Object became to faint to see, so I used the Sky Guide app on my phone to see if it was a satellite, to which I couldn't find any.  Position of the object was in between Andromeda galaxy and a star named Mirach.;38.6766;-96.896
