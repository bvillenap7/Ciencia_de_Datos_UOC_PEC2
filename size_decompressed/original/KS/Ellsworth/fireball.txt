Orange lights over central Kansas.;2016-04-12 21:30:00;10 minutes;Orange lights over central Kansas. On Tuesday the 12th of April, 2016, at approximately 9:30pm, I observed 5 bright red ball of light that looked like fireballs.  The objects appeared for approximately 5 seconds at a time and appeared to pulsate.  They started out small and proceeded to grow for about 5 seconds.  After which they disappeared.  At one point I was able to observe two lights at one time. The lights were coming from southwest of my location and were coming in approximately two minute intervals.  As one light disappeared another would appear in a different spot however they were in the same general area.  They did not appear to be any kind of military aircraft based on their shape, color, and movement.  I canâ€™t give an accurate measurement of how far they were from my location.  I am not an aviation expert and I do not work for the government.  I have never seen a UFO before.  I am just a civilian reporting on what I witnessed. I was unable to get any photos or videos of the event. I contacted our local police department and two of our local news channels to see if they knew anything about it.  The police were not aware of the situation and neither were the local news channels.  However the news channels did say they would investigate.  I would also like to mention that there were aircraft in the area shortly after the lights disappeared.;38.7344;-98.1992
