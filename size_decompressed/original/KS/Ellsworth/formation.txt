Witnessed a moving formation of lights in night sky.;2015-08-03 21:30:00;1 minutes;Witnessed a moving formation of lights in night sky. On the evening of Aug.3rd 2015 my husband and I were fishing at Kanopolis Lake, Ellsworth Kansas. At approx. 9:30 pm, we witnessed about 8-10 square, very bright, white lights in the sky, moving upwards, North to South in a stacking formation.  When the next light appeared the former disappeared. It moved behind dark clouds (and it was dark out also), so we lost visibility.  I could still make out its movement, but only barely. The lights were about a thumb size at an arm’s length, far exceeding the size of a star/ airplane or satellite. Unfortunately, we had forgotten our phone.  As soon as we retrned home we called the reporting number and left a message. I called the two local county Sheriff’s dept. and nothing had been reported. After speaking with your group, I also called the local Air Force (as there is a bombing range fairly nearby but is in the opposite direction), and they had nothing out that night. He even joked and said “ Cue spooky music,” when I explained what we had witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the wife, who was a witness to the lights, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  PD));38.7344;-98.1992
