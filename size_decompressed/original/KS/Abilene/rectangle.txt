Bronze rectangle remained motionless above the treetops.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-11 10:00:00;10 minutes;Bronze rectangle remained motionless above the treetops. Driving north on Buckeye Ave. (KS-15), I was somewhat shocked to see a bronze rectangle suspended motionless above the treetops.  It just sat there, maybe seventy-five feet above the ground.  This was at the corner of N.E. 13th and Buckeye, about two blocks south of the Sonic Drive-in . Once I stopped the car, I attempted to get a better look at it.  It appeared to be twelve feet wide and then it went back, about fifteen or twenty feet.  It looked to be about six feet high, not real high.  The color, though, that’s what was most interesting.  It wasn’t a uniform bronze color, there were smaller rectangles of darker material that dotted the underside. I pulled my phone from my hip pocket and when I looked back, the object was gone.  Just like that, no sound, or anything that made a noise that I could remember.  I don’t recall engines or propellers or, for that matter, lights, just this rectangle. Once I got back to the office, where I sell insurance, I honestly didn’t know what to do.  Who do you call?  Who do you report these things to?  What do you say?  The whole thing was a little unnerving. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.9371;-97.2063
