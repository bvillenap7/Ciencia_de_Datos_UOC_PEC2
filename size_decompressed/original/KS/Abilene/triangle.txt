No sound.  Disappeared.  Going approximently 90-110 MPH. We were coming home from an AHS basketball game.  We were turning to our road to our house.  We do live close to the Abilene Municipal airport.  But owning a Piper Cub, I knew this was no earth plane.  To quiet.  It speeds past without a sound and goes on past the car and the ligjts disappeared.  It has took me a while to talk about this.  But I finally did.
