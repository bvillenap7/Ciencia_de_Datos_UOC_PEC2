It slowly lowered with no sound to the size of a hang glider that is what I thought it was... a hang glider with glowing circles on it.  As I watched this thing what ever it was the dim greenish grey lights moved out of its origional pattern into what I could only explain as a geese formation the V. I dont know if I was shocked by what I saw but I sat there froze till it went past the tree I was standing under.  I then asked my husband if he had seen what I had and he said no but look in the sky and there it was very far off flying towards the east like it was making a circle from the town.  At a distance it was still in the shape of the V formation but the lights then appeared to be white.;38.9371;-97.2063
