The light was moving west to east in an eratic manner,with no sound.;2005-06-25 23:00:00;2 or 3 seconds;The light was moving west to east in an eratic manner,with no sound. I was sitting outside with a bunch of friends, and as I leaned back and looked up at the sky a bright white light appeared from over the top of my friends house. It was traveling west to east. Its movement was quick. It stopped for a split second over the pond behind my friends house. Then made one more quick move and stopped again for a split second as it went past the east end of the pond. Then in a blink it was out of sight. It was hard to judge the altitude of the light because of the darkness and its quick movement. I would estimate it was no more than one hundred feet off the ground. My best description of the light would be a bright flourescent light contained inside a white plastic shell. My best estimate of size would be around 1 foot in length. If it was on some sort of craft I couldnt tell, it must of blended in to the night sky. There was absolutely no sound.;38.6169;-95.2798
