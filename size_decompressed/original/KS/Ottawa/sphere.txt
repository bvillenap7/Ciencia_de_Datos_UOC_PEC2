Silver, spherical object spotted near Ottawa, KS;2007-07-15 12:20:00;10-15 seconds;Silver, spherical object spotted near Ottawa, KS Today I was travelling by car on I-35 South to Emporia, KS from Overland Park, KS.  It was a beautiful summer afternoon, with a clear blue sky.  Around 12:20 PM CDT and approximately 5-10 miles before I reached Ottawa, KS, I looked out my front window towards the right (which I believe was a N/NW direction) and saw a large, shiny spherical object hovering in the sky for about 10-15 seconds.  I got a very good look at it, as it appeared to be extremely close.   It was a bright metallic white/silver color.  It looked like a quarter or half-dollar stretched out at armâ€™s length to the sky.  The object was tilted and slowly continued to tilt until it looked like a grey sliver in the sky (like looking at the edge of a quarter against the sky).   After about 2-3 seconds it completely vanished.  I immediately pulled the car over to the side of the highway to look around the sky.   There was nothing at all.  No smoke, streaks, or trails.  I continued to look around for about two minutes and did not see any moving objects in the sky whatsoever.;38.6169;-95.2798
Ball of fire;2011-06-30 20:40:00;10 sec;Outside with neighbors shortly before dark and saw what looked like a bright ball of fire to the west much like a flare traveling in a perfectly straight line north north west at ? airliner alt .  It was not reflected light, it was flickering, (not shimmering or flashing).  It moved at a constant speed across the sky but at least 4x the speed of any plane i have seen.  We just finished making comments about it when another one with the same trajectory passed by.  We heard no sound, and it left no trail.;38.6169;-95.2798
