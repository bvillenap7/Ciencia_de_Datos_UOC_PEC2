The UFO was shaped something like a foot ball the length of about 2 school busses but with many white and red lights on the underside;1978-07-15 18:30:00;45 min;This sighting started with my parents as they were driving home. The UFO followed them until they arrived at our home in Kansas, about 5 miles. My mother brought my brother (15 yrs old) and I (12) at the time and now 37, out side to see this object hovering over the house. The UFO was shaped something like a foot ball the length of about 2 school busses but with many white and red lights on the underside. As all of us gathered outside I mentioned to my mother we should get a picture of this. At that moment I do believe we were taken aboard the craft. I don't remember being on board but we lost about 45 min. The last thing I remember was being inside our home with both my parents as they were looking a blank T.V. screen and my brother was later found at the front of the house outside. My brother didn't remember anything about this but has been visited many times to this day only saying that he was with a small girl in all cases and she has never revealed herself. My mother only remembers the craft as they were driving home. My father doesn't remember anything to this day. At the time that this happened none of us remember this ever happening until about 8 yrs later. We still talk about this when we see one another. There are not any markings on my parents or brother but I do have a scare on my left ankle about 4 in long that I or my family do not know how it got there and is still visible today that may have been made by a surgical device and now has something visible under the skin. I'll get this looked at some day soon. I only hope that some one will read this and possibly notify me if they were in Kansas at the time and remember anything. Thank you.
