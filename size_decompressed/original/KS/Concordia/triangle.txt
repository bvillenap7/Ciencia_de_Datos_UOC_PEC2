Two stationary bright objects in the northwest sky,  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter??  PD));2015-07-02 21:30:00;30 minutes;two stationary bright objects in the northwest sky At approximately 9:30 p.m. I saw two bright objects at two o'clock on the northwest horizon outside of my house at  ((deleted)) Highland Drive. Both objects were stationary.  The one on the left was larger and more triangular in shape than anything.  It had different colored lights flashing from beneath it.  The smaller one, on the right, was not flashing any lights. A picture taken at a Blur concert in Hyde Park in London on or about June 20 is the exact formation that I saw.  However, the objects in my sighting seemed to much closer and larger. I checked about 30 minutes after my first sighting and the objects were still in the sky.  I checked the next several nights, but I did not observe any unusual objects in the sky.;39.5517;-97.6518
