Tonight I saw the exact same UFO on a UFO TV show on the History channel which showed video of one of the astronaut UFO sightings.  This sighting (video) showed a circular light that had traveled fast enough to catch up the the NASA space craft going about 18,000 miles per hour, suddenly slow down and then reversed course.  I saw the exact same object back 1969 over Baldwin City KS, and it again did a totally impossible physical manuever, only this time what I saw was it travel way up in space very fast across the stary sky, and in one instant do an exact 90 degree turn.  I've never told anyone about this buy tonight i saw the exact same sight when I was 13 years old.;38.7949;-95.2309
