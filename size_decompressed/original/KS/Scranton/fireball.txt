It looked like a VW on fire very bright and moving very slowly downward.  We lost sight of it behind a hill.  We were within a 1/4 mile and it was low we watched it from about 1000 feet to about 25 feet off the ground before we lost sight of it.  I stopped the car thinking we would hear a crash but did not.  We went home and called the police reporting what looked like a VW Car on fire falling slowly from the sky.  We went back but could not see anything.  My son is on crutches and could not go the terrain at night and I was too afraid to walk over the hill on my own.;38.7894;-95.7473
