Flash of light in night sky leads to missing time in Central Kansas;2005-12-30 03:00:00;10-15 minutes;Flash of light in night sky leads to missing time in Central Kansas I stepped out of my house to look for the newspaper when I noticed a gigantic flash on the northeasten horizon. I thought it might have been a LifeWatch helicoper at first, but there was no noise, and the colors continued to get brighter and brigher. It was moving in a kind of a zigzag pattern from east to west.  It seemed to be very close to the ground. By that I mean no lower than 1000 feet. For a while, it seemed to just stand still. Maybe for a second or two.  I kept track of the time because I was watching a show on TV that had just ran the opening credits but hadn't started yet when I decided to look for the newspaper. Well, I just stood there, then suddenly noticed the paper wasn't there, and I don't know how to explain it, but I went back inside and my TV show was nearly half over--fifteen minutes had past, and I just thought I was outside for two seconds. Whatever this thing was, at this point, it flared up like a torch and veered off to the west at a rapid speed.  Then the light just blicked out, like when a lightbulb burns out. I didn't think too much about it first, but I noticed that I was trembling.  My arms and my legs. To an extent, I still am trembling.;38.3936;-98.7803
