PD));2007-06-20 22:00:00;4 min;huge intensely bright balls of light over northeast kansas in the northwest i saw a ball of intensely bright white light larger and brighter than jupiter traveling very slowly with a smaller and dimmer light following it from behind,smaller than venus. i watched them for about 1 min and ran to get my binoculars and zoomed in and just a huge ball of light, no strobes no fuselage no tail and no wings. they traveled southeast and moving much much slower than any small airplane. it took them about 4 min to travel across overhead. the lights never even waivered,flickered or changed intensity in any way-there were no sounds whatsoever-complete total silence.i used to be a crash fire rescue [cfr] man for many years at a major jet-equipped airport and am fully trained on all kinds of aircraft and i cannot identify what i saw at 10 pm 06/20/07 over northeast kansas.
