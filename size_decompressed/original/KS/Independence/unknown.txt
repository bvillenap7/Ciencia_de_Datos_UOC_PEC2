A blinking light of variable speed & intensity;2018-08-30 20:48:00;3 minutes;A blinking light of variable speed & intensity Saw a bright light, blinking at a rate of approximately one blink per second for about 5 blinks, when I went out my front door. I was facing East.  The light was slightly above just to the East of Mars. It then moved up and to the East, blinking at a slower and slower rate as the light faded, then it suddenly disappeared. Because of the brightness of the light, and the changing of the speed and duration of the blinks, I am sure this was not an aircraft. The sky was clear with stars all around.;37.2304;-95.7004
