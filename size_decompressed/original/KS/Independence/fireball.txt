The craft popped up out of nowhere, it looked close to the ground but that could have been because of my perspective. It was at first a white circle, and then it fell, kind of like a shooting star. It then changed to purple, white, and then eventually black, with a green aura. It then disappeared.;37.2304;-95.7004
