After arriving at Lyon County State Fishing Lake, I exited my vehicle and immediately heard what sounded like a sonic boom, but not as loud.   I then heard what I thought was a fighter jet on an easterly heading because the sound seemed to go west to east.   I looked up and saw an object that appeared to be flying at a high rate of speed and heading west.  It was only visible for minute or less, but the sound of what I thought was a fighter jet heading east was still apparent and I perceived the sound to be going east.  The object heading west was not a light but looked metallic and I couldn't tell what the shape was because it was, what appeared to be, miles high and I didn't have binoculars. In the past I had heard of fighter jets being scrambled to investigate and try to intercept unidentified flying objects, and this was almost an immediate thought.   I feel our military was scrambled to investigate something or I did not perceive things the right way.;38.5314;-95.9861
