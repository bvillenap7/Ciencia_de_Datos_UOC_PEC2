Three brown, round triangular objects.;2015-12-15 03:30:00;~2 minutes;Three brown, round triangular objects. I have been a stargazer all of my life.  The night this happened, I couldn't sleep, so I decided to take my dogs outside.  I was curious to know what the sky looked like that night, so I stepped off of my patio, two or 3 feet from my house, the sky was perfectly clear with no moon.   My dogs had been playing, an stopped abruptly.  They turned to the west, so I followed their eyes to the western horizon, and over the trees, about 30 feet above the treetops was this dark smooth shape.  As I watched, two more appeared behind it, an started weaving back and forth behind the first one, which stayed constant in its path.  As they passed overhead, my backyard lights lit up the undercarriages, revealing a glossy brown/gold color with three black stripes starting midway an continuing to the rear.  No lights, and no sounds emanated from them as they continued westward out of sightâ€¦ I followed till they were out of sight from my yard.;38.1958;-99.1059
