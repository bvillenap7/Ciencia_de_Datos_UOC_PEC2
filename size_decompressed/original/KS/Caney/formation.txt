UFO near Caney/Havana Kansas;2008-03-03 23:00:00;5 minutes;UFO near Caney/Havana Kansas My husband, son, and I were heading home from a friends home. I was in the passanger seat and noticed 4-5 bright (looked like football stadium) lights in the sky to the Northwest through the drivers window. I brought it to my husbands attention and we, along with a car behind us, pulled off the the side of the road. The 4-5 lights were VERY bright and stayed in one place. Then, a 6-7-8 light lit up and all 8 light lit up across a large area of the sky. The UFO stayed in the area and lit for about 4 minutes. Then, one by one the lights slowly went out. My husband called the local sheriff's office and they stated there had been several reports to them over the last 3-4 nights, but quit a bit tonight. I called the local airport (very small one) and was informed that there were no flights in the area. This happened North of Caney Kansas on highway 75 just south of Havana Lake. I can't quite remember the date, but am guessing it was around March of 2003. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
