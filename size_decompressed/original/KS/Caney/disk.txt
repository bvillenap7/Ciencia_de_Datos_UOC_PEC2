We all looked to the right of the car.... 2 of my other friends and I were coming back from Coffeyville, KS, we all saw something out the right side of the car.  One of my friends said, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!  We all looked out the window and were very very uncomfortable with what we saw.  It looked like it was a few hundred yards to the north of the highway we were driving on.  The shapes were a light yellow in color and didn't seem to move much, except that every time we lost sight of them whenever they reappeared, it seemed like they had moved with the car.  This lasted for 30-45 min. We lost sight of them again and they disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a precise date.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in March 2003.
