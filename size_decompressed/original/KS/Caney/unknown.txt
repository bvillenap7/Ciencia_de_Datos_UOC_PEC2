Driving home, going North, on a clear night, I saw a bright red light appear in the Northern sky.  It was a steady light that only lasted for mabe 2 seconds and then vanished.  It re-appeared just as quickly, only now there were 2 of them close together.  They vanished and then 1 re-appeared west of the first location, but at the same height.  After 1 or 2 seconds it vanished.  I did not observe them after that, but there were as many as 10 military jets flying over the area for up to 1 hour afterwards, just flying back and forth.;37.0196;-95.9057
