Wingless Aircraft Disappearing in Mid-Air at Low Altitude in Western Kansas.;2007-11-03 09:40:00;1 minute;Wingless Aircraft Disappearing in Mid-Air at Low Altitude in Western Kansas At 9:40 a.m., Saturday 11/4/07, we were traveling to Dodge City, KS on Highway 50.   Approximately 4 miles east of Cimarron, KS on highway 50, we sighted what we believed to be a single crop-dusting airplane flying at low altitude above the fields to the north of the highway.  It appeared to be about 500 to 1000 feet above ground and it made a slow banking counter-clockwise turn around the field.  It was shiny silver in color with some red on it.  There was no sound or vapor trail from the object.   However, as we approached, we noticed that it lacked wings.   As the passenger in the car watched it continuously, he saw the object disappear before it would have crossed the highway.   The driver and passenger looked all around the sky after the event and could not locate the object anywhere.  It had not landed or flown out of range it had simply disappeared in mid-air. Both witnesses are familiar with various types of aircraft, such as crop-dusting planes and ultralight aircraft that can be seen in the area from time to time.   This object was not a conventional aircraft.  It had a crumpled appearance, and had what appeared to be a rear fin on its body.  However, it had NO WINGS.;37.8113;-100.3377
