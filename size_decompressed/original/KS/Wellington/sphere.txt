Bright Orange Sphere.;2014-05-26 04:08:00;2 seconds;Bright Orange Sphere. An orange sphere the size of a softball but brightly lit moved rapidly and erratically from side to side zigzag while traveling  north to southerly direction leaving a small trail of light behind itself.   I woke up to let dog out and always look up at stars and sky when the orange sphere appeared above and between two trees that are across the street and about only a couple hundred feet up above in the sky and shown only for about two seconds before being out of sight into the treetop.;37.2795;-97.3878
