Car lights in the sky passing over the highway from Wellington, Ks.;2007-10-23 00:00:00;5 min;Car lights in the sky passing over the highway from Wellington, Ks. Two lights passing over the car on a highway between Wellington and Haysville.  The lights were large and appeared to have a grid pattern and were spaced like car headlights.  It moved slowly from west to east.  One person thought they had seen  a red tail light.  I did not see the red light.  We drove on after a brief stop.  I could only see the lights.;37.2795;-97.3878
Five people watched three different colored lights move around the sky North of Wellington, Kansas.;2016-08-21 04:15:00;30 minutes;Five people watched three different colored lights move around the sky North of Wellington, Kansas. On a camping trip, about a mile south of Wellington, 5 people witnessed an unexplained object in the sky to the North.  The object appeared to be above or just to the North of Wellington. At first, the object looked like a candle light. The first two to witness the object believed it was a Chinese lantern at first.  The object began to alternate slowly between being dim and very bright.  As the object was fading intensity, the first two witnesses alerted the next 3 to the object.  As the five of us watched, two more lights, one red and one blue appeared.  The three lights moved independently of each other in sporadic and random patterns, changing in intensity for about 45 seconds before fading away.  I feel like it is important to note that one of the spectators felt that the experience was too intense, and towards the end, began to feel extreme anxiety.;37.2795;-97.3878
