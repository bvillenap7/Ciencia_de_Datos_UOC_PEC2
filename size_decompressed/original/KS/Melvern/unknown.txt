Blue-white light traveling northwest in Osage county;2007-01-03 22:45:00;2-4 seconds;Blue-white light traveling northwest in Osage County Just a bright blue light coming from the south east and dropping to the north west.  Cant say how large or how far, just that it looked like a basketball from where I was standing.  It did not travel in a straight line and seemed to zig and zag 2-3 times in the short time I saw it.  There was no trail, just this dazzling blue-white light like you see in high powered lcd flashlights.  There was no sound, and the object did not fade instead it just blinked out, like it had gone behind a building or a hill, but where I saw it was at my house on top of a hill, where it would not have gone behind any other objects.  Definately freaked me out, as Ive never seen anything so random.;38.4997;-95.6268
