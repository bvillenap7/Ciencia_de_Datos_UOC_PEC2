Unidentified Object with flashing lights near Edgerton KS.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the star, Vega, we suspect.  PD));2010-10-05 20:00:00;1 Hr 40 Minutes;Unidentified Object with flashing lights near Edgerton KS At 2000 hours on October 5th, 2010 I went out for a smoke on my deck.  I noticed a bright object due west hovering in the vicinity of Baldwin, Kansas. I called my wife and daughter out on the deck and ask them to bring out my binoculars so that I could look at this object. The object was like a bright star but had had flashing lights. These lights were visible to the naked eye.  The object was round or oval shaped with a domed top. There was a bright white flashing light on top. Below that at the base were multi-colored lights (Re, White, Blue, Green and Yellow) flashing in a counter clockwise rotational pattern. The lights were very visible from the bottom of the object with the aid of binoculars, which my wife, my daughter and I all saw. The Object remained motionless, just hovering and silent. I estimated it about 5-8 miles away between Edgerton, Kansas and Baldwin, Kansas directly due west of Edgerton along Old Hwy 56. By 2045 hrs, I realized that this was definitely no helicopter or known aircraft.  My home is surrounded by New Century Air Century, the Gardner and Ottawa municipal airports and I and 60 miles South West of Forbes Field. I call the FAA and received no response and by 2050 called the Johnson County Sheriff’s Dept and a Deputy was dispatched. He was nearby and arrived by 2055 hrs. He observed the object and looked at it with the binoculars. I report to him that the object has been static for over an hour.  He was dumbstruck, and though it my atmospheric interference, or a UFO as in Unidentified Aircraft.  He was polite and professional and left. My family and I continued to watch the object until 2140, when I retired for the evening. I am Retired from the Army with 30 year of Service and work as a Civil Service Employee for the Coast Guard.

There was the bright white light on top with colored lights (Red, Blue, Yellow, White and Green) flashing in a counter clock wise motion. I called my wife and daughter, and went inside to retrieve my binoculars and video camera. At 2012 hours the camera was set up and my wife and daughter took turns looking at the object. It had moved to about 55 degrees from the surface of the ground at about 280 degrees WNW. The object lasted in view until I went inside at 2137.  I stored the equipment and went out again at 2158 hrs and the object was gone.
