It was Christmas night 1999 and my son and I were outside on our back deck trying out his new telescope.  We were out there for about an hour and a half and we were starting to get cold so we decided to go in.  My son went in and I was packing up the telescope when I looked up and saw an object fly over my house from south to north.  It was triangular shaped, but the points looked rounded.  It also almost looked transparent, almost like it was a thick piece of glass.  The only way I could see it at all was because the star light was being refracted at the edges as it moved through the sky.  There was no sound, and it seemed quite large, but since I don't know how far away it was I don't really know how big it was.;38.7645000000001;-94.8198000000002
