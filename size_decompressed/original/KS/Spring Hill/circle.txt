My friends kept giving me a lot of shit because I was laying down just looking at the stars.  I love looking for satellites and shooting stars.  Any time from 23:00-23:30 a very bright circular light flew above us.  Standing up it was at about a 70 degree angle, so not right above us but not in the distance by any means.  I was watching it for a few seconds thinking it was a plane. I quickly realized at the altitude and how bright the lights were we should have easily seen flashing lights.  Once I saw this I yelled at everyone else to tell me what it was.  Their first reaction was a plane.  I told them if it was wouldn't there be flashing lights. They starting staring at it and we all knew it was not a plane! We watched it go threw the sky for awhile in a straight path. It started to raise and the light started to dim. So we thought it could be a plane rising in the sky. The light ended up comp! letely disappearing but where it disappeared at there is no way a plane would no longer be seen. Especially how bright it initially was. I fully believe 100% that we saw a UFO! I am the type of person who gets skeptic about this but I know it was nothing else other than a UFO!;38.7645000000001;-94.8198000000002
