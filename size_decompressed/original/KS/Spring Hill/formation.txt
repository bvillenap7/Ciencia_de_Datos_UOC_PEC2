Looking out a southwesterly facing window on the second floor of our house, I saw a large orange-red ball.  It resembled the full moon in color when it’s just above the horizon.  I thought perhaps I was seeing a planet, but it was abnormally large for a planet and there were no clouds to suggest I was seeing a small part of the moon.  It almost seemed to be ‘twinkling’.  Then it split into two balls.  I continued to watch and it reformed into a single ball.  It split into three balls, then four.  One ball was slightly larger and above the newly formed balls, which were in a curved line below the larger ball.  I ran downstairs to see it from outside but it was obscured by the tree line, so I ran back up to the bedroom window.  It had reduced to two balls, then quickly back to one, and it slowly faded away.  It was the strangest thing I’ve ever seen.;38.7645000000001;-94.8198000000002
