Blue/green orb that shot off and disappeared.;2010-11-09 12:20:00;5 secs;Blue/green orb that shot off and disappeared. I was driving home from a neighboring town.  At about 1 mile left till I reached my house, I was on the highway going 65 mph and it was a clear night.  I notice something in the sky and look up and it was an orb that was half blue half green, divided perfectly.  I got eyes on for about 2 seconds then it sped off into a blue streak and disappeared in the blackness.;37.2682;-97.1629
