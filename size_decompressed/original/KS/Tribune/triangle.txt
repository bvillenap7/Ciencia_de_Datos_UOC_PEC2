Triangle craft with three red light in western Kansas.;2014-08-03 02:00:00;1 minute;triangle craft with three red light in western kansas I was driving north on HWY 27 just north of Tribune, Kansas, when from the northeast, a triangle shaped craft, 40-50 ft in diameter, flew from NE to SW right in front of me.  The craft was completely silent and had three solid red lights at each corner.  It was about 100ft from the ground.  I could easily identify the shape of the craft against the starry night sky.;38.499;-101.7644
