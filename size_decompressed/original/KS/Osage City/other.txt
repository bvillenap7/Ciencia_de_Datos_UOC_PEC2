Strange lights in the sky.;2013-11-17 00:00:00;20 minutes;Strange lights in the sky I am not sure what I saw.  A strange light over Osage City Kansas.  It throbbed with blues, oranges and white pulses.  It hovered silently for a while.   I went inside and got my camera,  The zoom was insufficient to get it clearly against the black night sky.  At one point the lights rotated circular separated slightly then regrouped with 3 on the top and 4 on the bottom.   I suddenly felt that I was being watched and after snapping several photos decided to head inside out of fear.  I don't know why it scared me, but it did give me a creepy feeling and the hair on my arms and neck stood up straight.  I have the photos if you want them.   Oh yeah, it made a small hum, really faint, definitely not an airplane or helicopter though.;38.6238;-95.8263
