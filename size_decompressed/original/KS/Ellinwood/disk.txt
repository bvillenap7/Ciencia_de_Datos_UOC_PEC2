A creepy encounter in Ellinwood, Kansas.;2007-10-20 21:00:00;10 minutes;A creepy encounter in Ellinwood, Kansas. My mom was in the kitchen when she looked up in the sky and saw a REALLY bright light!  It was in the direction of north.  We looked for a few more minutes and three more started to show up.  As if on a dimmer, they got brighter.  They were in an odd shape, such as below: . . . They moved in sync from left to right in a formation in a fast motion. About 5 minutes later they dimmed out, and we have seen them in different parts of our county at many different times since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
