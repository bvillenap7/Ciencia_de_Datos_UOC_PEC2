Balls of light disappearing and reappearing.;2000-11-13 22:00:00;15-20 min.;Balls of light disappearing and reappearing. I was setting in the passenger seat of my friends truck and looked into the rear view mirror and I noticed two or three bright orange lights hovering over some wooded land that my friend owns. I commented to him that I didn't remember ever seening those lights(me thinking that the lights were street lamp type lighting) on his land before and he looked at me like I was an idiot and he had no clue of what I was talking about. All of a sudden the balls of light vanished and reappeared in a matter of about 10 seconds. We pulled the truck over and got out to watch the lights. By this time there were five orange lights. One light would disappear for a few seconds and another would disappear and then reappear. It seemed as if the lights were on a timer or flashing a signal of some kind. We observed this for 15-20 minutes until the lights were gone. The lights always stayed in a half circle formation and all stayed in the same spot. This was not an airplane and there was no sound.;38.3541;-98.5872
