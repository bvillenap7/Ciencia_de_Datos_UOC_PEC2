Then all at once we could hear some noise like a computer would sound when connecting to the internet, it was deafening.  We ran inside to call the cops and came back out and they had gone.  We have seen them often about every three weeks now. ((NUFORC Note:  To the best of our knowledge, we have not received other reports from this part of Kansas for this date, or the earlier alleged dates.  If anyone witnessed these lights, we would invite them to submit reports.  PD));38.4156;-95.8269
