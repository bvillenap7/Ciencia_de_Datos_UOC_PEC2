An airplane would move in a straight line. Latitude is :  +39.768436 Longitude is :  -9593377590   About 9 pm we were outside and looked into the sky to the southeast of  where we were standing.  There was a star in the sky.  	BUT  as we watched it, it began to move.  It moved left a ways, and then down a ways then back a ways, up a ways  etc.   In other words.  Stars and planets sit in one place and donâ€™t zig zag. This looked like a star but not sure what it was?????  Can you help define this movement?  I am not sure if it was ufo or not.   About an hour later we went out to look again and it was gone.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of star, we believe.  We corresponded with the witness, and believe the star was Sirius.
