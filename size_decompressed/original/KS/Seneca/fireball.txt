Orange Fireball in the sky;2012-09-15 22:00:00;10 minutes;Orange Fireball in the sky We were going south on highway 63 when my husband saw something in the sky. we pulled off the highway and got out and looked. It was a orange disk shaped object, looked like it was on fire.  It was moving in all directions, and kind of fast, it was getting closer to the ground. At first we thought maybe it was an plane on fire. We got in the truck and went down the street and saw another one, I got out the Binoculars, and took a closer look. This orange ball of fire had a bright red ring around it, its movements were strange, no real direction, it would just be there, and than somewhere else.  We watched it for awhile, and it went away. We know this wasn't a aircraft, and am real sure it wasn't a Meteorite it wasn't moving in a line.;39.8473;-96.0316
