6 White dots stacked and moving together near ground in wooded area on trail camera.;2018-05-05 03:10:00;a few seconds;6 White dots stacked and moving together near ground in wooded area on trail camera. I have a Moultrie trail camera that recorded the objects.  The camera is set to fire three times if triggered by movement of a physical object.  Usually a deer, turkey or the motion of limbs in a tree.  The time stamp is accurate.  The camera during the minute on May 5, 2018 at 3:10 AM recorded the movement of 6 objects stacked vertically and separated by a greater distance than the height of each object.  It is a night shot so color canâ€™t be determined the individual objects appear white and in shape and size similar to a marshmallow or a vertebra, slightly more rectangular than square and moving across and away from the camera so the focus on the first shot makes them appear rounded on the edges in the first and squarer in the 2nd and 3rd shots due to the proximity of the camera.  It was not witnessed.  The camera is pointed away from any possible moon reflection and the background is trees and brush.  There are no roads or driveway in the field of view of the c! amera nor behind it.  The camera has been in this same location for over a year and no such phenomena has ever been recorded.  I would like to provide the photos to someone for interpretation.  I am a professional with a doctorate, over 70, and am rational and never reported any other such phenomena.;39.0172;-95.4352
