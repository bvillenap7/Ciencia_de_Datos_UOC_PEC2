I could see it moving south for about 15 miles in less than 10 seconds then suddenly taking abrupt right turn heading west and disappearing from view in 2-3 seconds.  It had one visible non flashing dim white light as it approached and two dim red lights as it flew west and vanished.  Appeared to be flying near outer space.  Sharp west turn seemed impossible for piloted flight within earths atmosphere at the incredible speed object was traveling.  I guess it to be some type of space survellance craft because no sound detected.;39.5595;-95.138
