Orange red light moving slowly in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-04 23:15:00;2 minutes;Orange red light moving slowly in the sky. Bright orange/red light in the southeastern sky, it didn't appear to be moving.  There were fireworks going off all around the area, this light stayed above the fireworks and didn't move. The light slowly started moving north and was zigzagging left to right. It appeared to be going higher towards the clouds, then it started turning west towards the moon. We waited for the light to get closer to the moon and when it did we saw the shape of this that appeared to be oval shaped. We heard a real low humming sound, it started climbing higher up and just dissapeared.  It was nowhere to be seen, just vanished.
