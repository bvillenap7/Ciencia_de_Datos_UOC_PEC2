One dims and re-lights in a horizontal row. 50 second video taken. On January 14, 2014, at 1845 hours, I got a call on my cell phone from my sister to come look at some strange lights in the sky. I drove to her location and arrived about 1 minute later. We observed two yellowish-orange lights in the western sky. The lights moved up and down and dimmed out, and then lit up. At one point, a series of three lights lit and dimmed in a straight horizontal row.   The night was clear and calm. I pulled out my cell phone and was able to video the lights for 50 seconds until they disappeared. After the lights dimmed out, we heard a distant rumble like a jet engine.  We could not see the cause of the sound, but assumed it had a connection with the lights.;37.5727;-95.7463
