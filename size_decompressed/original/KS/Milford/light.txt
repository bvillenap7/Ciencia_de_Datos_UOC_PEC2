Bright orange sphere seen in the eastern sky from Milford State Park.;2012-11-28 20:30:00;1 minute;Bright orange sphere seen in the eastern sky from Milford State Park At 8:30 p.m. on November 28, 2012 my coworker and I were walking in Milford State Park toward our vehicle.  We were facing east when we saw a large, bright, orange light.  The light was stationary and did not change size, shape, or color.  There was no sound associated with its presence.  The coloration was similar to that of a street lamp but more intense.  The light was bright enough that it emitted rays.   It was overcast so we were able to tell that the object was under the clouds. There was a full moon so the sky was illuminated, but we were not able to see an object that could be emitting the light.  In relation to the moon the object was far down and to the left.  If the moon were the center of a clock face the object would have been located at the 7:30 position.   The object was located approximately halfway between the moon and the tree line. The object was stationary for a long enough period of time for us to notice it, stare it at it, discuss its oddity, and photograph it.  After about one minute the light vanished leaving no trace of its presence. I am a nineteen year-old female with one year of college completed at the University of West Georgia.
