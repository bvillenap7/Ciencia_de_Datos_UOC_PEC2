Bright yellow lights formed a triangle;2007-02-15 20:00:00;2 minutes;Bright yellow lights formed a triangle I was helping my best friend move, It was 2-15-07. We were on our way back and I was driving behind her in my van. We were listening to the radio and of course we were in the middle of nowhere. I heard this low humming sound, it sounded like there was something that flew right over the top of us. I turned the radio down and looked to the left (that was the direction the sound went) at that time I seen three bright yellow lights just above the tree line. There were two on top and one on the bottom. It formed a up-side down triangle. Then, the three lights combined and went to one big light and it was gone in a split second. I got on the phone and called my friend who was ahead of me, and I asked her if she seen it, and she seen it too. My son was fast asleep beside me. The noise did not wake him up yet, that is how low the tone actually was. Then, it happened again. Same thing, the low tone above us, the three bright yellow lights combined into one and then... poof... gone! When it was over us this time my son woke up, and asked me what it was. He seen the lights that time too! I don't know if it was that for sure but I have no explanation for any of it! Just thought I would share my story.;38.5535;-97.8422
