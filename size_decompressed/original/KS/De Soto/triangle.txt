Iridescent/transparant /triangle shaped UFO witnesses by 8 people on Thursday, 10/13/06 at 22:00 hours.;2006-10-13 22:00:00;10 secends;Iridescent/transparant /triangle shaped UFO witnesses by 8 people on Thursday, 10/13/06 at 22:00 hours. (Note, I personally did not see the craft because I was inside the moment, but there were at least 8 witnesses on the trampoline outside who all saw the same thing) On the night of October 13, 2006, at around 10:00 PM, around 8 people (not including myself) saw an almost transparant triangle shaped UFO in the sky. They said it was around 15 to 20,000 feet up in the sky and it sort of glided through the sky. It was slightly iridescent in color and just bright enough to visibly see it, although the witnesses claimed to be able to see through it. They all said that it was really big, but hard to tell how so because it was so high in the sky.It was definitely triangle shaped.One of the witnesses also claimed to have seen the same unidentified object a few hours prior. I was extremely dissapointed not to have seen it, but my brother, best friends, and a few of their friends all seriously swear that they saw this UFO.;38.9489;-94.9748
