I was driving east on Highway 56 and saw a bright red and orange light fly in from the south, turn and hover in the sky in front my my car for about a minute, then instantly disappear.   The light was slowly changing color as it moved between red and orange.  I had music playing on a USB connection from my phone that started skipping songs as soon as the light appeared, until it started playing a song called 'Creep In A Shirt' from about halfway in, where he sings the word alien.;38.6959;-96.5499
Flashing red and green lights hovering in the sky;2020-03-12 21:00:00;10 seconds;Flashing red and green lights hovering in the sky I was sitting on my couch chatting on messenger, and my curtains were moved to the side because my cat had been playing in the window.  I looked out the window because I am facing the window and saw a flashlight red and bluish green light.  There was no sound outside at all. I watched the flashing lights curiously.  I saw the blue light disappear and then the rest light hovered, got a little brighter then went sideways in the sky.  These lights were low in the sky.  Then they disappeared.  I got up and looked out and saw nothing. Still no sound in the sky.  I closed my curtains, feeling a little freaked out.;38.6959;-96.5499
