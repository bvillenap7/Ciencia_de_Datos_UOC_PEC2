3 lights in triangle configuration moving south to north,VERY FAST,NO SOUND.;2000-12-13 18:50:00;5-10 sec;3 lights in triangle configuration moving south to north,VERY FAST,NO SOUND. I was outside grilling,I looked to the southwest at a bright star. As I looked,I saw light moving maybe 20-30 degrees to the left of this star. I observed 3 lights in a triangle configuration moving from south to north. This configuration of lights moved south to north at a speed I judge to be supersonic. As I watched it,the spacing between the lights,and the intensity of the lights remained constant. Also there was absolutely no sound. After it was gone,I waited for about 30 seconds before I came in the house, to tell my wife and report this.During this 30 seconds,I heard no sound at all. I observed this for about 5-10 seconds.;39.0284000000001;-94.6545000000001
