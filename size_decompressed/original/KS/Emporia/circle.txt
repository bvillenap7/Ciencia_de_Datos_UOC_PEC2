I was in the middle of nowhere, here in Kansas, near Americus.  As I come over a hill, I looked to my right, the passenger side of my car, and noticed a bunch of lights.  At first I thought it was only a cattle yard or something to that nature, until I looked a little more closely.  I seemed paralyzed when I saw what I saw.  I don't, or didn't, believe in ufo's or aliens, but what I saw was unexplainable, and unbelievable.  I seen a round object, about a quarter or a half mile from the highway.  I know it was round because of the bright lights that went around it.  They weren't colored lights, just white lights.  It was hovering above the ground, motionless.  Not horizontally, but at a slight angle.  Stunned, curious, but honestly and regretably a little frightened, I slowed my speed a great deal as I drove by.  I stared at the object as I drove right by it.  I wanted to stop, to go toward the object, but something inside me said to keep driving.  I have no doubt what I saw, even though I know I can never tell anyone close to me about this, because it sounds ridiculous, like there should be some kind of explanation.  But I've driven that road many times and I know it well.  I know what I saw, I even try to dispute it to myself, but I can't, because I know what I saw.  Now I feel like I've done something about it.;38.4186;-96.1844
