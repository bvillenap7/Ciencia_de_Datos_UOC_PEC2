Amber lights in the shape of the number 7 or a backward capital F gliding silently across the Kansas night sky.;2004-12-29 18:15:00;5 - 10 seconds;Amber lights in the shape of the number 7 or a backward capital F gliding silently across the Kansas night sky. I was visiting a friend in Emporia, Kansas in late December 2004. As we were leaving her house one evening, I glanced up into the night sky and was startled to see a formation of square-paneled amber lights in the shape of the number 7 gliding swiftly and silently across the night sky. I immediately said something to my friend to look up and tell me what that was, but it moved too quickly and she did not see it.  I say it was shaped like the number 7, but I wonder if it was actually a triangular shaped object and the lit amber panels were making it appear to be in the shape of the number 7. However, there were also a couple of amber light panels in the middle left portion of the number 7, which makes it seem more like a distorted, backward capital F.  I would say it was gliding at about the altitude of a small private plane, though it looked to be as big as a city block.;38.4186;-96.1844
