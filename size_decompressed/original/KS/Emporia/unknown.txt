It was moving at a slow speed and appeared to have descended from a hight of approx 500ft to approx 50ft.  There wasn't any noise from the environment, wind, or the flying structure.  It continued to move at about 3-5 mph without any dipping, tilting, banking, or pitching of any kind.  The closest it came to us was about 150 meters as we were perpendicular to its movement. Then we left. While leaving a friend's house in Emporia, my wife, two kids, and I headed back to Topeka, via Interstate 35.  I was driving.  We were heading in a North-Northeasterly direction and it was approximately 02:30 hrs and the sky was clear (possible small clouds but stars were visible). While my kids were sleeping, I noticed a bright light in the sky to my 12:30-1:00 position as a pilot would verse.  Initially, it looked like an airplane with landing lights on that gave the appearance of being approximately five miles away and an altitude of about 1,500 feet.  So, I didn't pay it much attention. Later, maybe 5-10 minutes, I noticed the light was still in the same position, yet a little closer.  There now appeared to be two lights rather than one.  Now, it looked more like a stationary obstacle perhaps the light to a communications or broadcasting tower.  Later still, maybe 3 minutes, I continue to drive at a speed of about 65 mph.  Humerously, the two lights now appeared to be a car's headlights.  A car was slowly flying towards us at about 200 feet.  At this point I gave the lights my wife's attention.  It was now approx < 2 miles away and still appeared to be 150-200 feet off the ground.  As we got closer, I slowed down and eventually stopped the car on the shoulder.  There were no other cars in sight on the highway.  At this time the lights were about 1 mile out and closing towards us.  Its altitude appeared to be 100 feet.  I aske my wife if she had any idea what it was.  She guessed an airplane.  I recalled some friends earlier stating that a blimp had been in Emporia that day the;38.4186;-96.1844
