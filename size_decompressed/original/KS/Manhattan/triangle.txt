I was laying down in my backyard when I saw 5 orange V's gliding above. I thought it was an airplane because of the formation they were in but all three moved back and forth in a serpentine manner, and it was a constant glow.  They went completely across my field of view in a matter of minutes.  When they were overhead I could distinctively see the orange V that looked like lights on the bottom of a triangle shape ship. After they were no longer visible I went inside to tell my friends. About 10-15 minutes later I went back out to see a military helicopter (flashing lights as apposed to the solid orange) flying the same area I last saw the UFO's. Since there is a base at Fort Riley helicopters are common but I've never seen them behave like this.;39.20528046875;-96.5945445312499
