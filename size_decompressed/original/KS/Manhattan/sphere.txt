Sphereical object, reddish, low in the western sky 10:23 pm;2002-07-31 22:23:00;2 -3 minutes;Sphereical object, reddish, low in the western sky 10:23 pm I was driving south out of Manhattan, KS and noticed a bright object just above western horizon and stopped at Konza prairie lookout close to I-70 to observe.  The object had a reddish color and was quite bright it did not appear to move in the sky.  However, I looked away to another part of the sky and when I turned back it was not there.  I have little to no knowledge about stars, planets, satellites, etc., so there may be a simple explanation for this object.  I did look at several websites that indicate objects visible in the night sky, but did not find anything visible at that time and at that location in the sky that night.;39.20528046875;-96.5945445312499
