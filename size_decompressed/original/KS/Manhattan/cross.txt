Three lights flashing simultaneously.  It went....RED....BLUE.....GREEN.....RED....BLUE....GREEN...  The lights were very low to the ground, seeming to be keeping a quicker pace than my vehicle (chrystler sebring, in case you were wondering).  A loud hum was heard over the noise of the music on my radio.  I saw a very bright green beam of light, like a tractor beam from Star Trek, shooting out of the tip of the space craft.  The space craft was shaped with a long shaft and two flashing red and blue lights protruding from the base of the craft itself.  White lights spiraled around the cylindrical shaft.  After the beam had disappeared the space craft glew in a golden color and disappeared in thin air.;39.20528046875;-96.5945445312499
