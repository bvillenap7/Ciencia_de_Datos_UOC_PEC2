North bound fireball in Thursday evening twilight sky.;2013-12-26 17:43:00;4 seconds;North bound fireball in Thursday evening twilight sky Subject: Just reporting:  I saw a very bright, apparent shooting star early this Thursday evening, 26 Dec. 2013 around 5:42 PM.  It was visible in the eastern sky, when viewed from the Zeandale Road area east of Manhattan.  It was traveling from southeast to North northwest.  It was on a fairly flat trajectory and visible for about 4 seconds.  The amazing part was the colorful display of some hues of green, red along with the normal bright white colors.   Did anyone else report seeing this apparent shooting star just around or after sun set time.;39.20528046875;-96.5945445312499
