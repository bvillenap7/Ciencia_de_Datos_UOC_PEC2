Six  bright yellow lights in kite, backward L and diamond formations;2008-10-28 18:50:00;15 Minutes;Six  bright yellow lights in kite, backward L and diamond formations It is 28 October 2008. I drove home from work at 1800 hours along 1-70 interstate highway from Topeka, Kansas to Manhattan, Kansas.  At approximately 1850 hours I saw six bright yellow lights in the sky in a backwards L formation. Perfect formation and not moving nor admitting any pollutants in the sky as an airplane would.  The L formation turned in a perfect kite formation and continued to beam yellow light.  The first light of the kite formation was brighter than the rest.  Slowly they faded away but never lost their perfect formation.  I pulled off the side of the road because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  My husband said it could be helicopters (he was not with me).  I’ve been around Army sikorsky UH-60 helicopters and numerous types of aircraft in my 13 years of military experience and never saw such perfect still lights in the sky that simply faded away. If anyone else saw this on the night of 28 October 2008, I-70 Interstate Highway near Manhattan Kansas, please input your entry.  Thank you all for reading this entry.;39.20528046875;-96.5945445312499
