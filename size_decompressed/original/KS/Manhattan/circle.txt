4 orange lights vanished out of thin air;2019-06-28 23:00:00;5 minutes;4 orange lights vanished out of thin air I was driving on K18 heading towards Scenic Drive with my husband, and I noticed 4 bright orange circles. 2 were on the left side of the sky, and they were in a straight vertical line, and then the other 2 were slightly south and in the same vertical position. I pulled over to look at them and one slowly blinked out of existence and then one by one so did the rest.;39.20528046875;-96.5945445312499
