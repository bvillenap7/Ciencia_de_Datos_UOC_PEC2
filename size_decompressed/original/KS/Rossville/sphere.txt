White spheres spotted in Rossville Kansas;2020-10-03 15:00:00;1 minute;White spheres spotted in Rossville Kansas Description: white spheres zipping through the clouds/sky at unimaginable speeds. At some points they would zip themselves into a triangle formation.  The spheres even seem to blip in and out of existence. I was on Main Street in Rossville facing North.  The videos capture the UFOs great when you zoom in and slow them down *I will email these*  You can see all the points in which they travel, and even a really good view of the aircraft.;39.1459;-95.9578
