A triangular craft with a light at each end and a slightly larger central light;1995-06-19 22:00:00;5-7 min.;A triangular craft with a light at each end and a slightly larger central light Parked in the the country just north of Belle Plaine, KS my friend and myself sighted the plane/craft flying at medium level. Not as high as a jet nor at a level where the size was determinable. It was dark probably black but the lights underneath it were bright enough to obscure the vision as to color but the outline of it's shape was clearly visable in the clear sky. It hovered on occasion before changing direction. This lasted for a few minutes then it flew north out of view we saw several other normal (perhaps military) planes in the area afterwords. It's worth mentioning McConnell Airforce Base is  in Wichita about 25 minutes away. I've never thought about reporting it since I've always assumed it was of military origin. ((NUFORC Note:  A dramatic event was reported to NUFORC by the Cameron, MO, Police Dept. for this date, as well.));37.4013;-97.2804
