7 bright yellow stationary lights for four to five minutes that extinguished one by one observed over farmland.;2004-11-03 20:45:00;4-5 minutes;7 bright yellow stationary lights for four to five minutes that extinguished one by one observed over farmland. I am a 50 year old professional.  My son is 25.  On Nov 3rd, 2004, at 8:45PM, I went to deliver an ATV to my son's rural residence.  There was no one home, I waited, he arrived a few minutes later.  When he pulled into the driveway, he drove all the way to the rear, near the barn, where I was, and told me to get in, that we needed to go around the row of trees that bordered the north side of his property so that I could see the lights.  He seemed urgent, I got in and when we drove around the trees there were the lights he was talking about.  Seven bright yellow-orange lights arranged in 2 groups.  The left group was almost a straight line of four lights, the right group of three lights was slightly seperated from the other four, and was triangular in shape.  The lights resembled sodium street lights in color, but very intense.  We observed these lights for what seemed like four to five minutes, through binoculars that my son had in the car, as we are waterfowl hunters also.  Through the magninification of the binoculars the lights were very visible, and appeared bright form edge to edge, being circular in shape.  This was odd, as most light sources are brighter in the center than the edge.  After approximately four to five minutes, the lights began to go out from right to left, one by one.  The last remaining light stayed bright for about 30 seconds, then slowly dimmed from view.  The lights never moved, and seemed to be hovering over the farmland.  We waited an additional 3 or 4 minutes to see if they would re-appear, and did not.;38.0465;-97.3483000000001
