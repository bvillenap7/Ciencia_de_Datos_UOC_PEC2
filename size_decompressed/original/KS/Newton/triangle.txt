I saw a triangular form of lights slowly float forward above the tree line out front of our property.  There was no sound.  I knew it wasn't an airplane because there was one flying high up leaving a jet trail.  This craft was too low to be an airplane. The top light was a strobe of red, yellow and 2 white lights, while the bottom 2 lights (made up of 2 lights on each side) made the corners, were just bright white. The outlined shape was hazey because the lights were so bright, so I couldn't tell if they were attached to a shape or if they were just 3 lights in formation. I ran inside to wake my husband up.  By the time he came outside it moved south and the bottom lights would fade in and out.  They were still bright all around even when it had turned another direction.  I watched it until the lights just faded out and it disappeared completely. We live in the country just 2 miles outside a small town.;38.0465;-97.3483000000001

I had thought they were an airplane as they had one light that would blink 3 times. However as one flew directly above me I noticed it had 3 red lights in the formation of a triangle one of the lights would blink 3 times rapidly and within a second, blink again. My friend and I saw a similar craft on a seperate date.;38.0465;-97.3483000000001
