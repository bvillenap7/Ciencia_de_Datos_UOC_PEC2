Four or five lights, on a seeming spinning object.;2006-04-19 21:02:00;About 2 Seconds;Four or five lights, on a seeming spinning object. I was driving home, it was fairly dark, and I was about to turn the second to last corner before reaching my house. At the time of the sighting I was facing east. Through the windshield, I saw four or five greenish lights that appeared to be fairly low to the ground, maybe two-hundred to three-hundred feet high. The encounter lasted only maybe 2 seconds, if that. However, from what I saw it appeared that the lights were in a stright line as if attached to some larger object. As I saw them, it appeared that the object on which the lights were mounted was spinning as it moved. I only derive this conclusion from the way the lights moved across the sky. Soon the lights were on the north side of the seemingly triangular shaped object, and they all merged (on a two dimensional plane). After this the lights disappeared and after watching for another few seconds or so, the lights never reappeared. I drove quickly one more block to my house and quickly got out and looked in the direction that the craft was moving, but I didn't see anything.  My sister, who was in the car with me, also saw the object. I think she may have seen it a little longer than I did. All I said to her was, Woah. I didn't describe what I had seen to her, to make sure she had seen the same thing that I did. She also described seeing the lights in the same way that I did. Although my sister did see the object, she did not have her glasses on and her sighting might not be trusted. I, on the other hand, have had a vision screening within the last month or so and got a result of perfect vision.;38.0465;-97.3483000000001
