Was outside of garage at around 6:30 Pm to 7:00 in the evening looking to the South we seen what we thought was a streak of light looked like a meteor burning out.   Seconds later it reappeared lower on horizon as three bright orange lights side by side in an unmoving position.   About 15 minutes later we seen a single orange light flash on then off, move down and west, flash on then off again, and reappear up and further to the left only to disappear again, seconds later we seen what we saw the first time.
