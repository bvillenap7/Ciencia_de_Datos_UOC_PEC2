it was scary, and i was 5!;1981-09-07 03:00:00;several minutes;it was scary, and i was 5! my experience wasn't of a craft, but of an abduction i put abduction in quotes because the being i saw was in my bedroom.  i am unsure about the day, the month or even the year.  i only know that i was young approx. 5.  i awoke to find what i now know to be a grey, standing beside my bed.  and it appeared to be doing somehing to my abdominal reigon.  i felt a slight discomfert there, and a slight pressure on my upper legs.  i was terrified, frozen, unable to speak.  if it knew i was awake, it didn't show it.  i closed my eyes thinking it wouldgo away.  and i kept them closed until it did.;38.9196;-97.3529
