On its second stop, is when I stood at the edge of the porch and looked directly at it(I felt it must have known I was looking at it-becuase it stopped). Very bright white fuzzy light, no sound and very very quick. I immediatly had goose bumps all over my body. I can recall this in my mind to this day. Description of object: round, bright white fuzzy light. Noiseless, flew horizontally, across top of trees, stopped twice then turned and flew over our house. It was if they saw me see them and changed directions and flew away. This was a childhood experience that I cannot forget.;38.9196;-97.3529
