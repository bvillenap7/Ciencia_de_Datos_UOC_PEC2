It maneuvered straight up slightly, then down,  hovered in one place for a few seconds, then moved straight ahead behind a hill so we could no longer see it. This occurred in the day time, the sighting absolutely did not resemble fireworks of any kind, it was way too long and thin to be a helicopter, and could not have been an airplane because of how it stopped and again was far too long.;39.0285;-96.8401
