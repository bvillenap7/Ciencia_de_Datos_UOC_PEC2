Would appear and quickly disappear Bright circular lights flying through the sky.  One came straight up and then stopped and just fastly flew the other direction.   There were about 3 or 4 of the lights.  They would appear and then disappear.  For about 10 minutes they just flew around in the air.   It seemed to be a few miles from where I was watching.   The light was just a bright yellow/white looking color.;39.0285;-96.8401
We noticed what we thought was a satellite.  Then another one appeared.  Then another.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-06 19:40:00;>5 minutes;My husband and I were pulling into our driveway, when we noticed what we thought was a satellite.  Then another one appeared.  Then another.  Then another.  Then another..etc.  I counted 11 all together.  I ran inside to get my aunt and my husband stopped counting but said they were still coming, and coming.  Strange, they looked like satellites but were in perfect formation, perfectly distanced apart, traveling in a straightline across the sky. Southwest to northeast in direction (towards Manhattan, KS) Lasted at least 5 minutes.  Did anyone else in the area see this???;39.0285;-96.8401
