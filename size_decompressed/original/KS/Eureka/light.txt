Yellow orange light moving over Eureka ks;2018-03-12 09:50:00;10 minutes;Yellow orange light moving over Eureka, KS. I was on my way back from my barns, after helping my mother pull a calf out of a heifer.  When I got home, I saw something bright and orange in the sky towards the Eureka area .  (I lived 20 miles north of eureka, so I was looking south.)  I thought the light was just a bright star at first but then it blinked of and re appeared in a different spot it kept doing this in re appearing in different spots.   I call my wife and kids out the house to witness what I was seeing.  I even called my father who saw the same thing from 1 mile to the west of us.  The night sky was clear with no clouds and I could see multiple jets flying very high.  Compared to the jets flying in a straight line this was much father away and the distances between where it would appear and re appear made no since.   In seconds this light would move randomly up and down by distances of at least 30 miles.  When the light would fade out I could still kind of make out a low glow that let me know something was still there and I would see tiny lights flying fast around it.   My daughter caught the object on her amazon freefire tablet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.8298;-96.2864
Two white lights traveling at a high rate of speed.;2020-12-08 12:45:00;5 mins;Two white lights traveling at a high rate of speed. Driving east bound on rural highway 54, between eldorado Ks and eureka Ks. About 5 miles west of eureka. Very clear dark night, two white lights, tiny or way off in the distance looking almost straight north. The white light were clearly chasing each other, what got me most excited is both light traveling very fast came to a complete stop, went straight up, stopped then took off again headed west. I stopped pulled over and watched them travel west for a few seconds until they were out of sight.;37.8298;-96.2864
