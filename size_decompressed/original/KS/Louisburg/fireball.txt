13 lights over Kansas moving southeast and turning south.;2013-06-01 21:30:00;15 minutes;13 lights over Kansas moving southeast and turning south I was sitting out side enjoying the weather and noticed what looked like a fireball in the sky moving from the northwest to the southeast it was then closely followed by 4 more the then turned to the south and when into the clouds and i was standing there i saw 8 more following the same path i was able to record a few of them on a friends smart phone. the weird thing is there was no noise at all nothing that would say it was a plane or helicopter, they all looked like they were burning but there was no smoke trail and no trailing light behind them . it was just plain weird;38.6079;-94.6837999999999
