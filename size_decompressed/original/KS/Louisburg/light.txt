Flashing red and white light hoovering and gliding away.;2018-11-01 22:00:00;5 minutes;Flashing red and white light hoovering and gliding away. My buddy and I were driving home from band practice.  A few nights before we had noticed a strange flashing light in the sky close to where we were so we dove to the same spot.  When I looked in to the sky there it was again.  A white and red flashing ball of light.  The lights pulsed on and off rapidly and very bright.  The lights were hovering in place.   I stopped the car to observe them and it started to slowly glide away towards us.  I turned the car around and began to follow it.  It picked up speed and started to rise in altitude.   As we drove behind it it rapidly flew away.   The first night we saw it there were jets chasing it.  Two jets flew at it in a triangle pattern.  One flew away and one followed the lights.  The light moved fast and did what I would call warped away.  A bright light flashed from nowhere near the jet.   The jet flew up and into the clouds as to escape I assumed.  It was all very strange but me and my buddy saw this happen.;38.6079;-94.6837999999999
