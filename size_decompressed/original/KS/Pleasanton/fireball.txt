At around 4AM, we witnessed an orange, elongated (it was longer than it was wide) object/light moving at an incredible rate of speed.  It was mostly fire orange in color but at the front/tip, it seemed a lighter orange or possibly whitish orange.  It seemed like a fast moving plane on fire when I first viewed it but at closer glance realized it was not anything like that.  The object was to our West moving North to South at a constant speed and altitude.  There was no noise at all.   We had been seeing shooting stars all night and this object was nowhere near that kind of speed (buzzing across the entire skyline in 2 seconds).  However, it was moving fast enough that we were only able to view it for about 12 seconds before it was far enough away we could no longer see it.;38.1847;-94.7063
