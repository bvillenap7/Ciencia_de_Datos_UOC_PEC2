Bright circle swimming through the stars.;2007-09-03 20:00:00;15 seconds;Bright circle swimming through the stars. It was dark outside when i noticed a strange light zipping through the sky. It was circular and round in shape, quite larger than the stars around it. At first glimpse I thought it was a falling star, but as I looked closer I saw that it was not falling. It was moving very quickly in a straight line above me,appearing very bright at first, then fading, then turning even more bright than before. I've never seen such a tremendous sight in my life.;38.0218;-94.8746
