Me and girlfriend walking down dark road to look at stars.  Saw a purple light to the South East of town. It would hover, and dance from side to side.   Seemed very far away, but moved with a very agile speed.  It would hover for minutes at a time before shooting off again.   It disappeared southward (down?) over the horizon. 5 minutes later it shot back up, briefly hung in the air before distinctly pulsing red twice, and then going down over the horizon again.;38.931;-95.0996
