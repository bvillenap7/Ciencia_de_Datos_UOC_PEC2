Small bright lights traveling straight before a few split off in different directions.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-18 21:46:00;30 minutes;Small bright lights traveling straight before a few split off in different directions. I was walking down my street when I looked at the sky. A set of stars began to travel in line around the sky. I brushed it off as StarLink (SpaceX), when I realized some of the stars started to split off and go in a few directions. The line was going from West to North, then South to North by the end of it. I called my mom and explained the situation.  A couple of my neighbors came out after seeing me standing in the middle of my street.  I showed them what was going on and they were as amazing as I was. The lights were bright, so when it began to end they faded to nothing.  Soon after, a thin fog rolled in and covered the sky. They looked as if to appear from behind the brightest object in the sky.  It’s not the North Star because it’s in the west.  I looked it up and was told it was the planet Venus. Helicopters seem to surrounding and follow the line at first, but flew off when it disappeared.;38.931;-95.0996
