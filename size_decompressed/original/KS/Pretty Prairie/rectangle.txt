I was looking at Saturn with my telescope.  It's a celestron 17.5 mirror, by 8' long, telescope conveniently my camera froze and would not take pictures until it was out of sight.   All I could see was the lights on it because they were so bright it was rectangular in shape it had four bigger lights on each corner and four smaller lights in the middle area.   It was not in our atmosphere and it made no sound it was going from the northwest to southeast.  Saturn was in the background when It flew in to view of my telescope.;37.7798;-97.9873
