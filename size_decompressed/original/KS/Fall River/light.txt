We viewed it through a 9x40 rifle scope and the lights were extending from it in a fan-like shape.  It is still up there.  Is it a comet?  Is it a vehicle launched from earth or is it simply my imagination run amuck?  Look just east of the upper most star in orion's belt.  If it is simply a star, please let me know.  I have never seen a star like that, but I'm not an astronomer. Observer #1:  Liscensed paramedic.  I work as a safety supervisor. Observer #2:  Housewife, married to #1 for 22 years.;37.6248;-96.0433
