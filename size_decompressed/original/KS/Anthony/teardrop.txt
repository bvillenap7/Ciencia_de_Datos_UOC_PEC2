When we got beside it, the lights came on with a giant sound and lifted up. I was driving along US highway 160 north and west of Anthony,ks.  The first thing was the loud whooshing noise coming from the right side of the road.  It was dark and as I looked to the direction of the noise all the lights came on.  It was triangular or bell  shaped with the large side on the ground .  After just a few seconds it lifted off the ground and went straight up.  We watched it until it was out of sight.  The windows were of translucent type.  It was in a plowed field and about 25 feet back from the edge of the road.There was a fence around the field.    The lights were not of any particular  color, dull white.  Other passengers in the car noticed the weeds in the grass whipping around from the wind caused by the craft.  One person was a high school senior male, age 17, next was a   female age 16, next was a male age 14 and another male age 13. The lights were coming from inside the craft.  It had long oval windows near the top and appeared to be possibly 3 feet long.  I could see no other features of the craft except when it was light up, I could see the outline of it.;37.1438;-98.0243
