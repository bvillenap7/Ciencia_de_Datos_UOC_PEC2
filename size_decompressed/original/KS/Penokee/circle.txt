Bright light with rotaton lights on outside of round body craft;2009-06-10 21:50:00;10 minutes;Bright light with rotaton lights on outside of round body craft On the night of June 10, 2009 I went out on our back deck to let our 2 house cats in about 9.50pm cdt..  There still was some light from the setting sun and not totally dark yet.  I glanced up to the sky to see if and what type of weather clouds and what direction they might be moving.  I saw a very bright light due south about 45 angle up from the ground.. It was a white light with bluish tint and stood out from being normal so I came back into the farm office to get my field glasses (7 power) and with them I could see a rotating clockwise band of lights that were changing from red/blue/purple.. studied it for a total of about 10 minutes..    The speed of the rotation of the outside lights  would alter from time to time along and in reaction to its sideways movements.  It was moving about 2 miles sideways if the total distance was 20 miles away..  Once about every 2 minutes it would move up and down 5 to 6 miles..  I could hear that my wife was coming into the house at the other end from shutting up the chickens and I steeped into the house and called for her.. When see got to the back door with me,, the UFO was just gone.. Could not see it anywhere..  But we do have a cedar windbreak around our place so it might just been blocked by them..  Hopes this helps out someone..;39.345;-99.9697
