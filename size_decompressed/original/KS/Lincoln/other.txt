I saw numerous (what I think were 5 or 6 at minimum) large bright orange lights with what seemed to be bright LED like what long connecting lights.  It was a pattern similar to a triangle or pyramid or similar and it was LARGE.   We were all immediately talking at once and everyone saying what is that etc.  I watched for possibly approximately 60 seconds  as  were ascending a large hill.   I thought and it appeared as if once we came to the top of the hill I could see it better, but when we crested the hill it was completely gone.  Literally within seconds.  We could see for miles and miles from the top of this hill and there was NO sign of anything in any direction we had just seen.;39.1027;-98.2149
