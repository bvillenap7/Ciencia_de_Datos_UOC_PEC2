Strobing light swooping from one position to another at random distances intercepted by a different light.  ((anonymous report));2017-08-22 21:45:00;3-5 minutes;Strobing light swooping from one position to another at random distances from previous location, intercepted by a different light. I am a medical professional and an amateur pilot.  I was letting my dog out and looked up and saw a bright flash of light.  I thought initially it was a strobe from a plane, but it was really bright.  So bright, it made me stop to see if it would do it again.   I tried to predict the path assuming it would be in a straight line as an airplane would fly but it showed up in random locations and distances from its previous location.  It seemed to swoop' from one position to another and would flash at each new position.  This happened over 10-15 times moving further away each time over a 3-5 min timeframe.  I was facing east at the time of the initial sighting and was facing south at the last point of visual contact.  It was an incredible distance to travel so quickly and moved like nothing I had ever seen.  At one point a smaller constant light that looked just like a star moved toward the object slowly at one of its stopping points.  The bright light immediately moved to a new position further away.   I have never submitted or seen anything like this before in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.9887;-94.6341000000001
