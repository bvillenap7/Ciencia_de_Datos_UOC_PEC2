Egg Shaped Objects Over   Garden City  Kansas;2007-10-24 18:00:00;10 minutes;Egg Shaped Objects Over   Garden City  Kansas I was outside  waxing my vehicle ,something caught my eye as  I was finishing up the top.It was an egg shaped object in the sky moving rather slowly to the north.My guess is that it was  about 1000 ft to 1500 ft. up. It hovered for approximately 4 minutes. I ran inside and got my two daughters ages 8 and 6 to see if they could see what I was seeing. As we were watching this object it looped around and started to head south. To our astonishment, as the egg shaped object was traveling south another object appeared it seemed to come from  above and was somewhat higher in the sky.The first object continued to move south at a slow place , yet the second object was at a stand still. We continued to watch the first object move south ,when we looked back were the second object  first appeared it was gone.The  whole incident  lasted for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Neighbors probobly thought we were loosing it,looking up in the sky and shouting and pionting.;37.9775;-100.8668
