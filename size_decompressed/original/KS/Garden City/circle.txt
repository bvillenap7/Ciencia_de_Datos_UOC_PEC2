Glowing object photographed in evening sky near Garden City Kansas;2005-11-08 17:25:00;30 seconds to 1 minute;Glowing object photographed in evening sky near Garden City Kansas On the evening of November 8, 2005, I was travelling west on Hwy 50 just past Ingalls Kansas, enroute to Garden City Kansas, where I was spending the night.  I was taking pictures of the sunset with my camera phone.  I had taken a few pictures of it, and out of nowhere, a circular object appeared off the driver's side of the vehicle, or south of Hwy 50.  This object hovered, seemingly matching my vehicle speed.  It was changing colors slowly from a shimmering green to a shimmering yellow. I was able to take a photograph, with my camera phone of this object.  It remained off my port side for about another 30 seconds, then in the blink of an eye, took off to the west, upwards at approximately 30 degree angle.  It looked like a shooting star, going the opposite direction.;37.9775;-100.8668
