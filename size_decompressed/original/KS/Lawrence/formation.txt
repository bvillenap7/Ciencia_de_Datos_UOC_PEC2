a huge flotilla of 50-200 glowing objects moving in formation;2001-12-01 20:00:00;2 minutes;a huge flotilla of 50-200 glowing objects moving in formation A sight to boggle the mind, the flotilla appeared in the southwest sky, travelling to the northwest at moderate speed in formation of 50-200 by various accounts.  The craft appeared to emit a surrounding glow and emitted long tail plumes which also glowed.  Some craft were seen as solid (not blinking) yellow lights that traveled in formation.  The speed was greater than helicopters and no sounds were heard to be emitted by the flotilla.  I seriously have no idea what this flotilla of craft could have been, but there were a lot and it was spectacular and many people saw the event.  Whatever it was, it was big, as the lights stretched across half of the sky before fading.

A formation of approx. 11 lights;2001-12-01 22:10:00;90sec;A formation of approx. 11 lights Aat 10:10pm I was traveling east on highway k-10 near the intersection of the  Wakarusa exit. I was surpriced by number of green lights 7 to 11 thatwere traveling west. Three of these sources of lights were radiating a beam of light much as those  projected by  aircrafts. The objects turned north, by now they were traveling in an horizontal direction and all of them appeared like a green light with an orange tail. After passing in front of me and traveling a distance os approx. 2 to 3 miles they disappeared from the sky. I called the local police department and found out that they were numerous reports of people seeing these lights. I entered this site to see if other people reported seeing the same.

I walked up the street and looked at a street light but behind the street light I could make out 5 far away dots of light that moved uniformly up and then to the south.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
