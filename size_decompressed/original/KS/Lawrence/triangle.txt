Pulled out of Checker's parking lot, (grocery store)onto 23rd St. Driving East until I came onto 23rd & Ohio St. Present with my wife, ;1999-09-29 21:37:00;3 minutes;Pulled out of Checker's parking lot, (grocery store)onto 23rd St. Driving East until I came onto 23rd & Ohio St. Present with my wife, we were looking toward's the North, when we observed the object in the sky. Above our car, moving at a high rate of speed, was a triangler-shape, with no center. The craft was about 200 ft. in th air, decending towards the NorthEast. Lights were on the left & right side of the craft. This occurence, happened the night of 09/29/99 in Lawrence, KS. Just got done grocery shopping, and present with my wife, we noticed a triangular-shaped object off to the North. This happened after pulling onto 23rd St, and coming up to 23rd & Ohio St. About 200 feet above us, and traveling at a high rate of speed, (no sound) was this trangular object with no center to it. As this was traveling, it decended off to the NorthEast, where we lost sighting of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date changed from year 2000 to 1999.));38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
Possible Explanation for 9/29/1999 Lawrence, KS Sighting;2001-05-10 23:30:00;<1 minute;Possible Explanation for 9/29/1999 Lawrence, KS Sighting In your reported sightings database for Kansas there is a sighting in Lawrence, KS for 9/29/1999 at 21:37 PM (reported on 9/30/1999, with note as date changed from 2000) of a triangular craft flying over 23rd street near Checkers grocery store. My girlfriend and I saw something very similar last night (5/10/2001, at roughly 11:35 PM) from the Checkers parking lot that was definitely a jet aircraft (I think a commercial airliner). The aircraft was very low in the sky (larger than a quarter at arms length) and moving from the SW to the NE. It was moving rapidly relative to an observer on the ground, though not especially fast relative to another conventional aircraft in the sky, and due to the darkness of the sky and lighting pattern on the aircraft when viewed directly underneath it had a vague boomerang or triangular shape. However, as I was standing outside and could concentrate on watching the object (unlike the person who reported the 1999 sighting, who was driving in his car), I could barely make out an aircraft body and tail section bisecting the boomerang. The craft looked very strange when I first noticed it, as it had two unblinking(?) white lights (one on each wing) roughly 2/3 to 3/4 of the way back on each wing (measured from the body to the tip of the wing) and a single unblinking(?) red light on the body between the wings (thus the apparent V shape), but as before once I stared at it awhile I could make out the body of the aircraft. I heard no sound when it flew overhead, though as there was a thunderstorm some distance to the north (thus significant winds at the jet&#8217s altitude) that&#8217s not surprising. The jet was in sight for about 30 seconds or so (very rough time estimate). Lawrence is in the flight path of several commercial airlines stopping at MCI (Kansas City International) airport and has been for the past several years (as early as 1996 my friends and I used to sit out on the patio with cigarettes and beer and, to pass the evening hours, played a game where we would see who could see each jet first as it flew overhead from SW to NE). Between 8:00 PM and midnight dozens of jets cross over the town from SW to NE, though not usually at such a low altitude. I suspect that what the man and his wife saw on 9/29/1999 was a low altitude jet on approach to MCI.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
Chevron or V shaped formation of hazy (no lights) objects silently moving at incredible speed.;2002-09-06 22:15:00;15 seconds;Chevron or V shaped formation of hazy (no lights) objects silently moving at incredible speed. My friend and I were outside enjoying the evening and a couple of cigars.  We were looking up at the stars that we saw.  There were very few because we were in the heart of the city.  All of the sudden we see this jet roaring towards us coming from the south west and flew overhead.  We ran inside to tell my friends fiance about the jet.  She obiviously heard it.  About 3 minutes later we went outside to finish our cigars.  All of the sudden 3-5 triangular to oval objects flying at high altitude and incredible speed in a chevron or W shaped formation.  The objects had no light except for a slight haziness(almost like the lights from the city were reflecting off of them) and made no sound whatsoever.  They flew right behind a tree that was blocking our line of sight and I run away from the tree so that I can catch another glimpse of them.  By the time I got to where my sight was not obstructed, about 4-5 seconds, they were gone.  Of course, we dismissed them as a flock of geese traveling   in a V but the objects were traveling towards the north and they made no honking noises which got us to thinking that these were not geese.  The objects  were also traveling at high altitudes and incredible velocity so we ruled them out as geese.  We now believe that the jet was maybe some sort of escort of some sort, maybe sweeping the area with a radar.  We have no explination for the objects we saw.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
Two Isosceles Triangluar-shaped craft gliding effortlessly.;2007-03-14 02:50:00;10-15 seconds;Two Isosceles Triangluar-shaped craft gliding effortlessly. I tend to be someone who looks in the sky quite a bit.  I have seen chunks of cosmic debris burning up as they pass in to our atmosphere in a variety of colors, shooting stars, satellites, and all sorts of aircraft, YET I've NEVER seen anything like this.  I was on the phone with my friend and decided to go outside for a bit.  I was looking up in to the clear night sky when all of the sudden, my eyes caught unfamiliar movement.  I focused in on the movement.  My eyes revealed to me two triangular shaped crafts.  They were dark in color and had white spots all over the bottom.  I assumed the white spots on the bottom were for lights.  They looked like lights that weren't turned on.  The crafts were flying due North.  They seemed to be at the height of a low-flying plane.  A few odd things I noticed:  -They flew like birds gliding through the sky.  No noise whatsoever. -As the went off in to the horizon, they were flying towards eachother, but didn't seem to be impacting one another. -While they were shaped like triangles, they were not equilateral.  Not only that, but they were not flying aerodynamically.  What would visually appear as the head of the triangle, was NOT the front of the northern moving ships.  It was like they were flying sideways.  This sighting lasted about 15 seconds.  It all happened so quick that I was not able to even think about getting my camera inside.  Way too dark, way to short of a sighting.  However, I am a skeptic at heart.  I have NEVER seen anything like this, and know what I saw was valid.  The mystery to me is: were these man-made craft that are just being kept secret, or are these extraterrestrial craft?  Either way, they were most certainly UFO's to my eyes.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
Slow, massive, low flying triangle;2017-02-11 18:31:00;5 minutes;Slow, massive, low flying triangle It was after dark.  3 lights in a triangle shape at what appeared to be very low altitude.  Was approx. 5x the size of a commercial jet but could not tell for sure.  Object moved fairly slow, and was completely silent.  Appeared to be over an apartment complex so there are likely other witnesses.   First thought was that it was a stealth bomber, however it was much much larger and it was not fast as they usually are.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
Very bright, white light flashing, triangular object moving extreme distances instantaneously;2018-08-13 04:30:00;5 minutes;Very bright, white light flashing, triangular object moving extreme distances instantaneously A group of us were watching the Perseids Meteor Shower.   The object appeared in the distance, as I pointed it out, it blinked brightly and disappeared.  It reappeared a few seconds later in much different part of the sky and continued to flash brightly, disappear and then reappear, and flash.  We were unable to make out the shape.  This went on for a few minutes.   Then the object appeared directly overhead moving at a very fast speed.  We could see the it was of triangular in shape, it left a light tracer behind it as it was moving above us, then flashed a VERY BRIGHT white light and vanished, never to been seen for the rest of the night.  At no point was any noise heard.  The object's flashing was at least 10x brighter than any meteors seen that night/morning.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
