Came out of nowhere, looked almost like a cluster of stars or birds moving like liquid through the sky, it was transparent aside from the multiple extremely dim lights coming from it, my girlfriend had seen it the night before and as she was trying to find a pic of it on the Internet is when it appeared, judging by the way that it moved I feel as though it was not a craft but an actual being of some kind, possibly from a difrent  dimension.  We were both immediately overcome with a kind of fear I have never felt before.  It was clear that although it presented itself as a cluster of lights it was one entity, it was almost like a fast moving mist, but it was going against the wind.  And it was definitely in our atmosphere.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
