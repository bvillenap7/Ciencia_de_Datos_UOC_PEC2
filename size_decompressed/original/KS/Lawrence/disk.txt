It was around 1:00pm and very sunny, so there was a notable reflection of something.  Whatever it was seemed to move, hover, and move, tilt, and then slowly fade out (possibly moving north which was away from us â€“ it just became smaller until it eventually was unobservable).  Definitely not an airplane or helicopter.  Was with a group of students and they saw it, too.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
