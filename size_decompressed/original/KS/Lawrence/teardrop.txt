Mysterious yellow teardrop shaped UFO Lawrence, Kansas;2020-07-18 22:48:00;7 seconds;Mysterious yellow teardrop shaped UFO Lawrence, Kansas At 10:48pm CT in Lawrence, Kansas sky gazing in the parking lot of Rock Chalk Park a local recreation center near the outskirts of the city I witnessed the following over the course of about 6-8 seconds:  A large teardrop shaped flying object appeared in the sky.  The object forked at the end and the two ends of the tear drop didnâ€™t quite touch . I could see the space between the two arms of the teardrop shape.  The object had a yellow hallow around it as if it were glowing.  The flying object was around 4 inches long in the sky and appeared to be  as close to the earth as you would see an airplane or a jet.  The object was moving from the SW (near Highway 10 entrance) to the NE (toward Queens Rd) and was flying straight and seemed to be moving both fast and slow at the same time. It covered the sky from point A to point B at a distance of about a 85 degree angle in about 7 seconds and then disappeared, it was completely silent.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
