Spectacular rainbow cloud in Kansas, too!;2000-08-09 13:30:00;10 min +;Spectacular rainbow cloud in Kansas, too! This parallels the Tawakoni, TX account of 8/9/00 at 23:50. On my way back to work I saw an extraordinary high cirrus cloud formation. Slightly larger than the back of your hand held at arms length, the cloud had a gorgeous, irradescent rainbow effect over it's full length. Similar to sun dogs (which I've seen several times) this was much more spectacular. I only mention it after reading the similar account out of TX on about the same day and was curious that the distance between KS and TX would allow the same cloud phenominon.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
fast moving v shaped dull white object over Lawrence Kansas;2001-10-25 22:45:00;4sec.;fast moving v shaped dull white object over Lawrence Kansas v shaped no lights, no sound looked like ghost going across sky at a very fast speed. It was higher than the shooting star that passed under it. It was a dull white color. We have seen this three time before about the same time of year and around the same time of night.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
Object   with crescent-shaped 'nose' flew in direction of the opened side  (i.e. with pointed ends of crescent leading);2004-10-15 18:22:00;approx. 15 sec.;Object   with crescent-shaped 'nose' flew in direction of the opened side  (i.e. with pointed ends of crescent leading) While sitting in my car in a parking lot in downtown Lawrence I happened to notice an unusual aircraft heading in a north easterly direction.  My training is in cognitive psychology and I no doubt lack the background and vocabulary to describe this object in precise terms, so please bear with me.  Fortunately, my training and background  did provide me with the good sense to sketch the object immediately after seeing it.  The overall shape of the object was roughly similar to that of a crescent wrench. The end-portions were like different sized semi-circles, with the one at the nose being smaller and perhaps less 'closed' than the one aft.  The portion connecting the two crescents, or the 'handle-part' to continue the crescent-wrench metaphor, was oblong--perhaps something like a cigar, the extreme aft portion of which extended slightly into the inside of the crescent and was rounded. The end 'points' of the aft crescent seemed to have rounded objects attached or were perhaps rounded themselves as if there were engines (?) or something at those points.   I cannot estimate speed or altitude reliably.  I might hazard to guess that it was roughly the same size as a commercial jet.  It appeared to be a dull black or dark-grey colored-- not the shiny metalic surface of commercial jets.  It did seem to have a noise of some sort, but it wasn't very loud and I did not notice any visible exhaust or vapor however, I don't recall now if the sky were overcast or not, which perhaps could mask a vapor trail (?).   If it were, it must have been below any significant amount of haze or cloud vapor because I could see it clearly.  Although it was 6:22 pm, it was still early enough to be seen easily.  I did not notice any lights.  The object moved outside of my view after a few seconds (10-15?) due to buildings around me.  What struck me as odd, was that the semi-circle or crescent on the front was opened in the direction of travel, i.e. the 'points,' if you will, of the semi-circle on the front of the 'fuselage(?),'  pointed in the direction of travel. Perhaps this is not unusual in aviation today, but it is counter-intuitive to the casual observer.  I should also note that Lawrence is about 50 miles or so south/south west of Kansas City Internationl (MCI) airport.  We are also about 100 miles east  of Ft. Riley, a military base. I assume that this is some kind of new military plane or something, but  the fact that no one else I showed my sketch to (non-military, non-aviation folks such as as myself) had ever seen one made me think I should report it.  I also did a google search and was interested in the account of the engineer from Huntsville, AL who posted on your site in June of 2003.  I was very interested in comparing my sketch to his if what I describe here is not a currently identifiable aircraft.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
2 brightly lit craft with banks of lights seen after dark within ten minutes of each other in similar flightpath.;2013-01-20 18:50:00;15 minutes;2 brightly lit craft with banks of lights seen after dark within ten minutes of each other in similar flightpath. I was driving to pick my girlfriend up from work on E-7 HWY when from the S side, over a ridge, came a very bright craft with a bank of lights unlike anything I'd ever seen. Sunset had been just about 18:30.   As it was turning to go N, it banked and the bank of lights turned with it.  It looked like one quarter of the lights from the ships from Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind.  I assume these were entirely terrestrial, but am including this report in case any others saw them.  We were under wind advisory conditions and I can attest to 40-45 MPH winds and this would be a mean feat for any aircraft, especially lighter than air ones as these must have been.  They were going too slowly to have been regular planes and almost looked as if they were some kind of advertising gimmick.  I should note there is no military flight path nor event center I know of for miles.  I followed this craft with the eye until I could no longer see it.  I picked up my girlfriend (waiting about ten minutes) and immediately told her about the sighting.  As we went back toward W HWY-10, another craft, exactly the same, came over the crest and I had to stop the car to give her a good look at it.  Wind gusts were really getting high now, but the highly-lit craft (mostly white) with its bank of very bright lights took a similar flight plan and didn't seem to notice.  No effects on car, radiation or otherwise.  It did not occur to me to try to take video of either craft, if I had been very alert, along with traffic, I might have gotten blurry video that may have looked like a very new type of aircraft.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
