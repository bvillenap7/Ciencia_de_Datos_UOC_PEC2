Diamond shaped object hovers over Kansas University Student Union 3/10/2012.;2012-03-10 15:45:00;3 minutes;Diamond shaped object hovers over Kansas University Student Union 3/10/2012. Location:  Kansas Univ. Student Union Bldg, 3rd floor cafeteria table near window facing the football field. I was sitting with 2 other adults and 3 children.  The reflection of one large diamond shaped object caught my attention out the window.  I asked if anyone else could see what I saw, and only the two other adults could see it.  None of the kids could see it, even though it was very bright and large.   I asked the kids to come around to where I was sitting to get better look, and they still could not see it, but for the adults it was still there the entire time.  The object was stationary for about 3 minutes then flashed very bright and disappeared.  We looked down on the field hoping to find an explanation or witnesses, but no one was in sight.  We never heard any sounds. Details:  Plenty of sunshine, no clouds, mid afternoon, no other aircraft or objects in the sky.   The object hovered motionless above the football field.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
