Long Cigar shaped object that was far off but giant hovered for about 2 min;2002-07-13 21:10:00;about 2 min;Long Cigar shaped object that was far off but giant hovered for about 2 min At around 9:10 Pm  I noticed a long thin objet in the sky. I believed it to be a airplanes streak from high altitude at first, but as i watched the entire thing moved little by litte.  It was far off i nthe distance but looked as if it was close do to its size.  It was an long cigar shaped, and must have been hughe because it was about the length of an airplane at 200 feet in the air, but was noticably far off in the distance.  I watched it for 2 min, then went to get a camera, but was gone when i returend about 5 sec later.  NO trace of evaporation from airplane or anytihng in the sky.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
