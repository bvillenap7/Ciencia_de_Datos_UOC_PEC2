This craft moved with too much force, that would've killed a person.;2004-03-19 20:03:00;1 minute;This craft moved with too much force, that would've killed a person. My wife and I happened to be looking up and saw a light moving erratically. It moved faster then a commercial airliner from west to east and suddenly stopped. Then went back in the opposite direction at the same speed and then stopped again, then went to the north. It did these kind of maneuvers for about a minute. The cloud cover was thick but this was underneath, then it went up. This incident was between the Topeka and Lawrence area of Kansas. I wouldn't even be posting this unless it was true. Wow. If this is government technology then I'm very impressed, but I highly doubt it is.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367

At first I thought it was a satelite breaking apart but they moved together down and then up. I called the nearest air force base and asked if they caught anything on radar. They treated me like a nut. This was between Topeka Kansas and Kansas City. If anyone else saw this can you let me know? Thanks, ((name and e-address deleted));38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
two small, round lights moving very quickly, with abrubt direction and speed changes seen in South Lawrence.;2008-11-20 19:40:00;30-40 seconds;two small, round lights moving very quickly, with abrubt direction and speed changes seen in South Lawrence. In south Lawrence (11/20/8 7:40pm CST), in the area of 31st & Iowa Streets, I went out on the deck for a smoke- looked up at the stars, and saw what appeared to be two, small round objects (appeared as medium bright stars) moving North.  The objects then stopped in mid 'flight' (flight was somewhat erratic- they would come close to each other, and then separate, but would always stay within a finger-width (from my perspective) apart), and then reversed direction and headed South.  I lost sight of them when they moved past my effective field of vision- they moved very quickly- the whole sighting lasted about 30 seconds from when I first spotted them above my house.  I thought at first they were high flying birds, but the strange flight characteristics (sudden direction changes, and what appeared to be terriffic speed (if they were as high as they appeared to be)) convinced me otherwise- I'm a college educated person who is extremely skeptical- I would not be writing this if I didn't truly believe that what I witnessed was something very odd indeed.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
Two orange objects spotted floating over Lawrence, Kansas, February 27, 2010 at 12:55 am.;2010-02-27 00:55:00;15 seconds;Two orange objects spotted floating over Lawrence, Kansas, February 27, 2010 at 12:55 am. I had just gotten home from a friends house and parked my car in the driveway. As I got out of my car I was looking at the Eastern part of the sky, which is very open from my driveway and this night was particularly clear. I instantly spotted two faint glowing orange lights off in the distance out of the Northeastern part of the sky that were headed South. The two objects, which had what I would describe as a fiery glow, were moving in formation, with one apparently leading the other and at a slightly higher altitude in the sky from my vantage point. The objects were traveling at a steady pace and appeared to float across the sky. I could not make out any sound coming from the objects, and to my knowledge they did not make any noise. I ran in to my front yard to try and track the two objects as they glided across the sky and disappeared behind my neighbors house. I ran to my side yard and around the back of my neighbors house, but the objects had vanished. T! he event was very brief but profound, I would have given anything to have had someone there with me to witness what I saw. This event felt like I was witnessing something that I could not possibly explain, which made the hair stand up all over my neck and arms. I have recently taken a more keen look at the sky as I am currently enrolled in an astronomy class at the University of Kansas, and I have to say that witnessing these two objects was easily the most intriguing, confusing, and spookiest thing I have witnessed to date.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367

The light was constant in illumination, not fast enough for any falling debris, but faster than a plane trajectory seemed to be declining, unlike a satellite also magnitude brighter than a star;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
Bright beacon style light sweeping over Lawrence. (Not the airport beacon);2011-10-28 20:10:00;10-15 mins;Bright beacon style light sweeping over Lawrence. (Not the airport beacon) After dark, I saw a airport-style beacon light (large, bright, and sweeping across the sky) coming from the southern edge of Lawrence, specifically 75 degrees south of west.  It was unlike an airport beacon in the fact that it only swept back and forth over an area of nearly 90 degrees.  The airport is also in the opposite direction.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367

Point of light that was moving in a straight line at a good speed, almost 2 times that of a passenger jet.;2015-09-06 21:09:00;4-5 seconds;On the Southside of Lonestar Lake, going from south to north, was a point of light that was moving in a straight line at a good speed, almost 2 times that of a passenger jet.   Part of me thought that it might have been a satellite but I have never seen one go straight north and south. The light was bright as the brightest star I could see in the night sky.  It had a white color to it and flew well above where the jets fly.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
Bright cherry-red light, steady movement and altitude, did not fade out.;2016-04-05 03:45:00;2 minutes;bright cherry-red light,steady movement and altitude, did not fade out. at apprx. 3:45 am, central standard time, I was in the parking lot of my place of employment.  I happened to glance up and saw a bright light to the SE of my position.  As this was just after the July 4th holiday, I thought it was a firework or flare.   I expected the light to either fade out or explode into a star-burst.  Much to my surprise, this light was moving steadily from south to north.  Aside from being obscured by cloud cover a couple times the bright red did not fade, nor did it change speed nor direction.   Because of its speed and altitude I thought it could be a plane, but I looked carefully and could not see any flashers, like a small plane would have.  It looked exactly like a very bright cherry red flare.  After about 1-2 minutes of observation, it was lost to sight as it traveled to the north.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
My experience started last summer and continues on to this day.  Leading up to my current “issue” with these objects.;2017-03-31 19:00:00;5 months-currently;My experience started last summer, and continues on to this day.  Leading up to my current “issue” with these objects, my father had always talked about this light in the sky following him wherever he went.  He didn’t know why, or what it's intentions were.  He called it his “guiding light”.  He thought it was a surveillance drone and if it is, why him?  Well 3 years of this guiding light had him pretty nervous.  I had only heard the stories, until one night we were heading to my mother's house to visit (parents are separated), and before we got out of the driveway, he asked me, “What do you think that is?” and pointed at a very bright light in the sky.  My first thought was:  It’s a planet.  It was bright like Jupiter or Venus.  Until I noticed how low it was and that it seemed to be swaying or hovering.  Then I said it's a drone.  Dad then tells me to keep my eye on it and see what it does. Our trip was going to be from Lawrence, KS, to Kansas City, MO.  He puts the truck in gear and we go.  As did this bright light.  It would stay in the passenger window down I-70 then positioning itself directly behind us and it was like it locked on to our vehicle.  It would sometimes ascend higher and then come back down.  It was tracking us! I was mesmerized. I had never seen a UFO and here is a full on bright, unidentifiable flying object following us down the highway.  The object followed us all the way to 152 hwy in Kansas City, MO. We get into the city and this thing decides to completely blow my mind by joining up with 2 more lights to form a triangle formation.  I am saying all kinds of, “what ((deleted)) is that,” at this point.  And as we turn down the street to my moms house they all 3 got as faint as dim stars, one after the other, and disappeared.  This was the beginning of my fascination that has now become my reality. Fast forward almost one year later, I researched the hell out of these things.  I know now it's not a FBI drone.  Not a police surveillance craft.  This goes way beyond that.  I start living with my dad  about 5 months ago.  This thing would literally hover outside of his house every night along with 4 or 5 other objects mimicking stars and constellations.  I decided to start filming them because if it is government then they are violating our rights on all possible levels.   Also, because they fascinate me.  I have videos of triangle craft, hovering commercial jets, cigar UFOs in the day time.  Aircraft that I can't explain  doing things we have no context for.  Well they now follow me everywhere I go.  Any clear night I have 1-3 star UFOs hovering over the house. Possibly more.  As well as very strange airplane and triangle craft that circle the house really low.  Some will eject smaller drones I shit you not. I've been watching and studying these like it is my job.  The strange thin! g is I can't get any media outlets or MUFON to investigate this. I know I'm not the only one.  We need to call attention to it and get answers.  I didn’t ask to be tracked and surveilled by these things.  I'm not a criminal.  I'm not doing anything wrong.  Please help get this story out!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
Helicopter chasing orange light at low altitude.;2017-05-04 23:00:00;~1 minute;helicopter chasing orange light at low altitude I was in my room in my apartment watching Dave Chappelle on Netflix, when I heard a helicopter overhead.  It sounded very low and powerful, so I figured it had to be military, and I-being a total nerd-had to run out to the parking lot to get a look. By the time I was out my door and in the parking lot, I had just enough time to watch a small orange ball of light being chased by what I assume to be a Blackhawk helicopter (because of size and sound) disappear behind the rooftops of the buildings east of me.    This struck me as bizarre because I saw something similar some months ago in the same general area (skies south of Lawrence, I live on the south side of town, not far from Baker Wetlands).   The light was small and orange in color and was about 50-100 yards ahead of the helicopter.  It made no erratic movements but was travelling at a fair clip as the helicopter was tracking it at almost the exact speed and it was moving pretty quickly.  As such, I have my doubts that this could've been a paper lantern (though the color and intensity of the light were similar to one) and the distance ahead of the helicopter rules out a refueling boom.  I'd give the altitude of the two objects to be between 500-1000 ft agl and the speed! of both to be about 100 kts at the time I saw them. Also of note, I saw another object in the sky in the general area at the same time, though it may not have been connected.  This object seemed to be an aircraft judging by the red and white lights it had on it, but it hovered in place for a moment until the lights slowly faded out with no apparent change in location.  The direction I was looking toward would be about a straight line to KCI, so I wasn't immediately suspicious, but--having seen plenty of air traffic heading to and from KCI on that flight path--this didn't look like anything I'd seen before (no landing lights).  I mention this because it was odd and because the previous sighting of a few months earlier of the same kind of event had 2 helicopters chasing the light instead of just one.  Maybe this was the second.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
