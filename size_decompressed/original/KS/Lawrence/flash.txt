Rapid moving flash of light while taking movie of clouds.;2016-08-27 20:20:00;<1 second;Rapid moving flash of light while taking movie of clouds Date: 27 July, 2016, at 820pm,  The location is Lawrence, Kansas, stopped on Clinton Lake dam to view Venus and Jupiter at dusk. I was taking photos of an interesting cloud bank with a new iPod touch (I donâ€™t carry a cell phone), the first time I had ever used it for photos, hoping to get some really interesting photos of lightening.  The photo is oriented looking east from Clinton Lake Dam, back towards the city of Lawrence, Kansas, seen in the background. I accidentally took movies for several of them, since the photo app on my ipod is new to me. 10 seconds into the 17 second digital movie is a flash of light that crosses from mid-level left traveling to the upper right corner of the movie. I saw this also with my eyes at the exact time of the event. I got home quite a bit later  and downloaded it into the computer. I have seen something like this one other time on Clinton Lake Dam, only the light traveled much slower then.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
