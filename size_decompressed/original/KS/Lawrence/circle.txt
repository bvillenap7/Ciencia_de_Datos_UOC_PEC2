5 objects of circular shape make a W shape in the sky;2002-09-06 10:15:00;2 min;5 objects of circular shape make a W shape in the sky I observed this on campus while heading to my engineering class. I saw 5 dots in the sky, at first I thought there were birds flying, but they appeard to be at a very high altitude. They were also moving too fast for a bird. I doubt that weather ballons move that face too. The 5 dots made a W shape in the sky and were moving south-west north-east 3 of the dots are white, 1 was green, and the last one was either red or pink. I also saw a very clear aircraft passing by them. It looked like a military aircraft. The event took about two mins. Maybe it's a new experiment in avaiation technology, I don't know. Hopefully we have an explanation soon.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
