I was on my way home with my daughter, from picking up my son at the theater. I looked up into the sky, and seen a silver triangular shaped, object, with red, yellow, and green lights. It zigzagged, and than shot up into the sky, than shot back down, shot back up, then dissapeared in plain veiw.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
Isosceles triangle shaped craft, seemingly hovering, and then disappearing.;2004-08-05 00:15:00;~2 minutes;Isosceles triangle shaped craft, seemingly hovering, and then disappearing. I was driving due east on 15th Street and had just crossed Kasold Street when I noticed a low flying object. I am not a good judge of aerial distances, but maybe 1000 feet in the air. It seemed likely that the object was an airplane at first, because it bore the blinking red, white, and blue lights typical of airplanes.  However, after a few blocks the object was nearly directly over me, and it definitely had the shape of an isosceles triangle with the short side not much shorter than the two even-length sides. Two aspects of this sighting made it strange. First, the object was barely moving. Although I was driving, I had slowed way down to maybe 5mph and it seemed to be hovering. Becuase the car was on, I cannot say whether it was making any noise, though I heard none over my engine. Second, after driving by the object about 5 blocks, I turned the car around to look at it again. It still seemed to be hovering, so I reached under my seat to grab my binoculars. When I looked up, it was gone. I didn't see it zip away or blink out. It simply was no longer visible. There were some high clouds, but definitely higher in altitude than the object. Of course, turning off its lights would have been sufficient to hide it from my sight.  I guess I'm not an unbiased reporter, since I frequently scan the sky in the hope of seeing something. However, in ~ten years of sky watching, this is the first sighting I've felt compelled to report.;38.9666010582011;-95.2480365079367
