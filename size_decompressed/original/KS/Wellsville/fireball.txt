My Daughter(name and infrormation listed below)was sceared to death by a big explosion in the sky over Wellsville,Kansas. Something, seeming big, blew up high in the sky. Multiple (8 to 10) flamelike streaks flew in all directions.  Nothing seemed to hit the ground. It was pretty spectacular. Much, much bigger and brighter then anything during the recent meteor shower. Other cars on K 68 Highway stopped to watch.   She called 911 within 1 minute of the explosion, but 911 said it was  just shooting stars.  Heard they saw it at the Louisburg Observatory(18 miles east) and maybe got pictures. She has since heard rummors that it was reintering Russian space junk. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.
