The ligh;1997-07-09 00:05:00;5 min.;Summary : As I was travelling west on 135th. St. between Antioch and Pflumm, I Noticed to my left a trio of lights which were strobing.  The lights were in a diamond shape, two ruby red lights at the upper two corners, and a brilliant white at the lower point.  The white light would pulse twice, then dim, and then the red lights would pulse and then dim.  The object was travelling from the southeast to the northwest.  My vehicle was travelling about 45 m.p.h. and after watching the object for about two minutes it passed over the road just in front of me continueing its course.  This was not a plane.  I observed no green marker lights.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
A bright light was observed going from south to north. It flased 4-5 times when first seen, stopped flashing then disappeared.;2000-06-24 21:44:00;5 seconds;A bright light was observed going from south to north. It flased 4-5 times when first seen, stopped flashing then disappeared. I was sitting outside my house looking south. I have a clear view starting at about 30-40 degrees above the horizon to 90 degrees. On the south are some trees and on the north is the backside of my house. I was sitting looking straight up and saw a faint light that flashed on 4-5 times in quick succession. The light came from the south and was going north at a very fast rate of speed. It appeared to be outside of the atmosphere based on brightness, speed, no sound. I frequently see a satellite going along a similar path at night but this was not the same. The first sighting was at 21:44 approximately. About 4-5 minutes later I saw what I thought was the satellite going in the same direction south to north but on a somewhat different path. It appeared much brighter than the other object but not different in appearance than it usually does when I see it. However it did appear to be moving much faster than it usually does.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
Streaking firework-type lights going south to north over western Olathe KS;2001-12-01 22:18:00;2-3 minutes;Streaking firework-type lights going south to north over western Olathe KS It looked like fireworks streaking sideways from south to north in the western sky.  We thought it was a meteor shower but it was going too slow.  I thought maybe something exploded and the fuel was on fire.  There were many specks of light, like a firework.  There were two main lights ahead of the rest.  Then the lights all winked out.  I don't know if it was a spaceship but it was definitely an unidentified flying object!

I saw around 5 to 10  little objects that looked like litte stars darting around in the sky.  Not in any formation, just randomly.  This last until 2 very strange looking craft, possibly airplanes flew by at a high rate of speed heading south.  I looked at the planes with binoculars.  Each on had 2 green lights and one that flashed red and blue in front.  I could not make out the shape do to darkness. Possibly B-2 bombers that fly out of a base nearby.  Either way I could judge by the distance and size this it was rather large.  My wife saw one of the darting balls of light the night before.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
I observed an object with red, blue and white lights in the sky northwest of Olathe, KS, that did not move for a period of 30 minutes.;2005-01-17 18:39:00;30 Minutes;I observed an object with red, blue and white lights in the sky northwest of Olathe, KS, that did not move for a period of 30 minutes. I was standing in my driveway on the night of January 17, 2005, talking on my cell phone to my Dad in Missouri.  I observed a stationary object in the sky northwest of my home at approximately a 330 Degree position from North (Approximately at a 10:00 o'clock position when I faced North).  It was at an altitude that I see many airliners traveling, and appeared to be about 5 miles away from my home.  The object had blue and red lights flashing.  At one time it lit up brightly with a white light.  It did not move for a period of 30 minutes.  My wife came outside and witnessed the object too.  After observing it for 30 minutes, I turned to walk to my deck for about 5 seconds and it disappeared.  During this time I described the light to my Dad, who is a retired US Air Force pilot and Intelligence Officer, on my cell phone.  He called the Missouri State MUFON Director and reported the matter.  The Director tried to contact a MUFON person in the Kansas City area to see if they could observe the object too, but he was unsuccessful in reaching the person.  I did not report the object to any law enforcement or other government official.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
Two lights in the night sky flying in apparent formation.;2005-04-29 21:35:00;Approx. 3 mins;Two lights in the night sky flying in apparent formation. At approximately 21:35 local time, 28 April 2005, while smoking on my deck, I looked up to see two fairly bright lights near the zenith moving generally WSW to ENE. The lights were separated by the width of my first and second fingers held at arms length. I called my wife to the deck and she also observed the lights. As we watched the lights move, they appeared to get closer together, although that could have been a function of perspective. When we lost sight of them in the glow of Kansas City at approximately 30 degrees elevation, they were separated by approximately the width of my little finger held at arms length. No direction changes were observed. No anti-colision lights were seen, and I was able to observe stars between the two lights as they traversed the sky.  I checked JTrack, thinking it was perhaps the ISS with a Progress resupply rocket performing a rendevous, but the ISS was below the equator at the time of sighting.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
Bright white/greenish light rapidly tracking across northern sky West to East, stops, darting maneuvers 1-1.5min total time.;2006-06-01 23:00:00;1 minute;Bright white/greenish light rapidly tracking across northern sky West to East, stops, darting maneuvers 1-1.5min total time. A small group of us saw a light tracking from west to east at a great rate of speed.  It was a glowing oval/circular? The glow was a greenish brite white. It was in the sky north of us. It was a little far away to tell what the EXACT shape was, but close enough to know that it did not make any sound.  It was odd, was moving way too fast to be a jet, or fighter aircraft of any sort.  I have never witnessed that type of light on ANY aircraft I have seen.  I noticed it and pointed it out to the small crowd.  We talked about it as we saw it.  It was flying at a distance that put it over trees that lined the creek that runs behind the apartment complex.  It tracked from the point I noticed it WEST, to the East where id did not travel to the horizon, it stopped at one point, dead stop, staitionary, it did some erratic movements- sideways, up, down, diagonal.  These movements were darts, not slow movements.  It headed north and started to go behind the trees.  I ran around the side of the building to not loose it, but it had dissappeared.  I wish I knew of this site earlier, I have told a few people about it.  It was an awesome experience, I have read on here people seeing multiple UFO's, I hope I get the chance to see more!!

K and C were driving down the street after receiving a phone call from a friend about a strange light appearing above his house. K and;2007-12-08 00:19:00;15 minutes;K and C were driving down the street after receiving a phone call from a friend about a strange light appearing above his house. K and C proceeded to drive over to his house to witness the light for themselves. However, as they neared the trailer park where he lives they noticed a strange contrast in the night sky and its coloration. On the left side of the street the sky was purest black. On the right side the sky was orange with a white strip across the bottom and darker as we looked higher up. As we drove through the trailer park the sky on our right proceeded to grow more orange. The previous orange shade intensified. Driving down the streets of the trailer park any where the vehicle went the streetlights around it dimmed and continued to do so until we drove away. As we drove out of the trailer park the sky seemed to darken and the orange light gathered behind C's car. Driving down the main street back to K's house we were stopped by a train. A light that was previously white was now yellow and while K and C were waiting for the train to pass other colors started to appear mixed in with the yellow. C rolled her window down to see if it might have been the fog that was starting to roll in. It wasn't. She asked a car on the other side of her and the occupants of the vehicle said they did not see any light. K and C both saw the light. The train passed and we drove on. The fog had gathered to become slightly obscurant and thus we missed her street the first time around. We drove a few more feet to the roundabout and turned around. We turned onto the correct street and stopped for approximately 3 seconds to roll the window up. There was a shadow behind the car yet when K and C looked there was no one, and nothing. There was likewise nothing there as we pulled away. We continued along the street until pulling into the driveway and walking into the house.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586

They were pulling into K's driveway and all of a sudden all of the streetlights on the block went out as well as the headlights and internal lights on C's car. The light flashed in the shape of a kerosene lamp flame. The light was below the clouds and fully visible to anyone in the vicinity. The light made a wide oval and at the vertex there was a perfectly horizontal stream of green light that faded to turquoise. A breeze passed through the car yet the heater was on full. A cut on C's hip was healed as well as the pain on the left side of her body. Or so it seemed. The pain was in actuality transferred to K's body. The pains were in exactly the same spots and same intensities as they were on C yet they were happening to K. K and C proceeded to pull into the driveway and then walk into the house.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586

I was in my room playing guitar hero 2 until my girlfriend called me. She was freaked out saying that her and her friend had just got to her house when all the street lights went out and all her neighbors lights went out and her car stopped then a bright forest green light with a neon lime green light on the inside went across the sky in about 4 seconds. She told me to look out the window and see if I saw the light too. i didn't see anything. Then out of no were I get some weird feeling and look out my window. About 100 yards away from my window in the sky I see a ball of forest green light floating then start to change from forest green to a teal blue and move from side to side then go stationary again. So far its still there. Its cloudy right now and somewhat snowing.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
Bright changing colored light followed by car from Olathe to Lawrence, Ks.  Object then began chasing the car back to Olathe / Lenexa.;2009-01-15 20:00:00;90 minutes;Bright changing colored light followed by car from Olathe to Lawrence, Ks.  Object then began chasing the car back to Olathe / Lenexa. On 1-7-2009 at approximately 21:00, an unknown bright object was spotted in the sky over Olathe, Kansas in the South / Southwest area.  The object was seen shining lights out the sides and changing colors from bright white to a dim soft blue, back to bright white and to a dim soft green and back.  Finally, at 21:30 the light dimmed to red and disappeared low in the sky to the West.  (2) individuals witnessed this event while talking to each other on cell phones. The same light was seen again on 1-15-2009 at 20:00 in the same area.  The same (2) individuals while talking on cell phones in (2) different cars viewed the object in the same vicinity directly over Pflumm Road in Olathe, Kansas.  This time, the object was chased by car (1) in an attempt at a closer look to identify the object.  The light was again seen shining rays out the sides and changing colors in the same pattern as before.  The chase car turned West from Pflumm Road onto College Boulevard and several times stopped to look at the object through a pair of binoculars, however, the object was too bright to make out any shape. Several times it seemed that the car was getting closer to the object.  When College Boulevard came to an end near the Douglas County Line, the chase car changed to K-10 Highway and proceeded to follow the light West towards Lawrence, Kansas.  No longer would the light allow the chase car to get closer, several times it appeared that planes flew near the object, but it was followed only by car (1) through Lawrence until K-10 ended at Clinton Lake.  The light then stayed in the same location for 30-minutes. Now it gets really interesting.  With the light still in the same location, the chase car began heading East, back to Olathe / Lenexa at approximately 21:00.  While car (1) proceeded back, the person in car (2) reported the light FOLLOWING the original chase car (Car [1]), changing directions and altitudes!  Car (1) stopped several times to confirm this!  This new chaser-being-chased event continued for 30-minutes!  Both cars proceeded to a parking lot at Shawnee Mission Parkway and I-435 where the object began a slow decent while still changing colors, now also changing to orange and red.  At no time did the color change flash (as landing or marking lights would), the color would just change from one to another in a random way.  The object now began moving back toward the west, away from the cars. At 21:30, both car (1) and now car (2) proceeded South on I-435 and the object began moving West/ South West again.  Car (1) exited on 87th street while car (2) continued South.  Car (1) came to a stop on a hill just West of a Kansas National Guard Armory.  The object was still in the distance and at the same low altitude, but becoming less bright.  Suddenly, the object turned a faint red and disappeared at approximately 21:45.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586

I only videoed only short time but took a few pics...  I didn’t know there was a local reporting site for Kansas until tonight ..  my nanny found the site and encouraged me to share this video.

Bright object flying in strange patterns between Olathe/Gardner;2018-03-15 21:00:00;20 minutes;Bright object flying in strange patterns between Olathe/Gardner Around 9pm as I was driving between Gardner and Olathe, I spotted a large bright object moving in very strange patterns a mile or so away from me in the sky.  At first I figured it was a drone or plane from the nearby airport, but I decided to drive around and follow it for a while.  It began flying closer then further away from me, in a very unnatural patters, almost like a figure-8 from side to side.  It also seemed to change from a bright white/blue, to green, to red, to blue.  It remained on the country roads between Gardner and Olathe.  I eventually drove into a dead-end country road, so I sat and watched the object begin to hover and drift away, disappearing in the distance. Possibly related—On the same roads I have experienced some strange encounters.  I have been driving at dusk and “ran over” some sort of bright shimmer crossing the road.  At first I mistook it for a raccoon or possum.  But soon realized I drove “through” the shimmer rather than ran over something!  I get some crazy goosebumps around that area.  It makes me nervous sharing these , but hopefully someone has other occurrences between southwest Olathe and Gardner/the New Century Aircenter.
