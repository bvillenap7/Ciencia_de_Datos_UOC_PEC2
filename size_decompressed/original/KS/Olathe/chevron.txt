I could hear a plane in the distance, but there was no sound coming from the object I was watching.  It was moving from the north east to southwest.  There were no lights and I would not have seen it had I not looked up at just that momemt.  It was just lighter than the dark night sky and had a solid appearance.  I could  not tell exactly how large it was because I couldn't tell exactly how high it was.  My best guess would be 500 to 1000 feet.  I would just cover the object with my thumb.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
Chevron with no lights.;2020-03-11 21:13:00;45 seconds;Chevron with no lights Absolutely incredible.  There is another similar report to this one from Olathe a couple months back.  Chevron shape, front half was gray and reflective (a sheen or reflection), back half was very dark. Line straight thru the middle, following the path of the wings at the same angle of each. No lights. Maybe 500 to 1000 ft above. Perfectly quiet. Turned rapidly.  We both knew what we were seeing as soon as it was in the sky above us. It appeared as if it came out of a mist or clouds. Much like the previous reports on this site, it's almost like it knew it was being seen. It disappeared AS it turned.  It was breathtaking but now that I've seen one I could see it being government just as much as it could be aliens. Upon viewing, it felt real, very high tech tech, it didn't feel sci-fi.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
