We stopped and watched as the objct rose higher until we could hardly see it. By then it was a small light in the sky, but we could see it was traveling in large circles in the sky. It continued to make the circles for about 2 min. when another light appeared (which may have been something coming from the craft), it also began making circles, but in the opposite direction of the other one. They continued this and then just went away. Unfortunately we did not have any vidio cameras or cameras to catch them.
