Size was about diameter of pencil eraser.  Sky mostly clear w/few small clouds.  Object disappeared behind tiny cloud just big enough to cover object.  Object never reappeared. Was traveling due West at 3:25 PM to pick up child from school.  Saw extraordinarily bright orb traveling slowly due North in straight line.  This is the second time I've seen this phenomenom (the first time was with my son and husband, also during daylite hours).  Like the first time I saw it, I strained to see if I could determine a form or origin of the object.  Have not seen as bright of object in daytime sky like this.  Was defininately not a plane or helicopter.  Thought maybe could be a reflection of some type but the reflection would not have disappeared behind a cloud.  The first time this object was observed, my whole family watched.  It was there one moment and gone the next.  Wasn't like we saw it fly off rapidly -- it just disappeared.  Today, the object went behind a cloud and just never reappeared.  Almost had a wreck on two-lane country road trying to relocate the object.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
Weird green ball seen moving swiftly;2008-05-04 23:30:00;30 seconds;Weird green ball seen moving swiftly Walked outside to smoke and viewed a round ball colored bright green moving very fast from south to north but not meteor like fast. It disappeared behind trees on the horizon. It was silent and appeared to be about two miles away.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
