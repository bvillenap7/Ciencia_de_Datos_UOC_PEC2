I instructed my wife to pull over and we all four watched and witnessed the craft hovering in one spot for several minutes.  The craft had flashing lights one being a larger red and a larger white and a smaller red light.   My wife and I noticed that at one point the two larger lights flashed much like a police car would back and forth and then light pattern changed and craft moved to the east and flew over our car, but I could not make out the shape, but I could hear it.   Planes and jets do not hover for several minutes so I can not explain what exactly the craft was,craft moved off to the east of olathe.   Another odd thing is my wife recorded on her cell phone but when we got home to replay her phone skipped and all we see is a flash on the screen ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

two objects spotted in night sky over Olathe, KS with eratic flight patterns;2013-10-26 21:30:00;Ongoing;two objects spotted in night sky over Olathe, KS with eratic flight patterns I was letting my dog in from being outside and noticed there were two objects in the sky a little above the tree and house line.  I was looking due west from my front porch.  At first I thought they were airplanes.  One was traveling a little lower and behind the other.  Then suddenly the front object changed course and flew straight up.  Then turned and headed downward.  There were blinking lights coming from both of the objects.  One of them had green and red lights. I ran and got my iphone and I took a video, which I have posted on youtube.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
