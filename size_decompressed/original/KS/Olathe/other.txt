Peanut sape heading north, low and fast, No noise;2001-06-05 22:30:00;3-5 min;Peanut sape heading north, low and fast, No noise My friend and I were sitting outside smoking a cigerette, as we do everynight. We were just looking up in the sky for MARS and I looked straight up above me, when I asked my friend, WHAT IS THAT?  He looked up and say said, WERE and he pointed to a star and said that is MARS. I said, NO RIGHT ABOVE YOU.  He looked straight up and said What the H--- is that? We both saw an objejct kind of shaped like a peanut, is the best way to discribe it, Round on both ends and thin the middle, it almost looked like a Transport helicoptor.  But there was NO Sound what so ever, it was totaly silent. It looked like metal and just the city lights making the bottom of it glow like a very dull reflection, He said he can see 3 light on it, I coulndn't. The object was heading due North comming from the South, it was about 2500 feet off the ground and we are guessing it was traveling about 150 mph or faster, but there was NO SOUND WHAT SO EVER. I have no idea what it was I have never seen or ever heard of anything like it, to this day we still are talking about it.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
Streaking, Slashing, formation of lights going slowly across sky;2001-12-01 22:10:00;3 min. ?;Streaking, Slashing, formation of lights going slowly across sky Saturday, Dec. 1, 2001. 10:20 Central. West of Olathe, Kansas. Driving west on 135th Street just opposite Lake Olathe. Looking west, strings of light appeared from SW horizon. color-reddish to orange. I would estimate a 55 degree angle from the western horizon and the objects covered about 10-15 degrees vertically.The objects were two (or three) strings (possibly slashes, or a combination of strings and slashes) of very bright light. It was as if it was a meteor but it was not. The object(s) covered about 1/3 of the sky. It was very clear and the full moon was to our back. The object proceded NNE in the sky toward Kansas City and disappeared over the horizon. There was NO sound.It was difficult to tell the distance. However there were at least two, possibly three blinking lights (as in aircraft) escorting the object. The blinking lights were small to indicate a good distance. If this is the case, the object(s were HUGH. It could have been one object trailing strings of lights, or a perimeter of lights. From the angle we viewed the object it was hard to tell. They were very bright and could have been connected. The object did not burn as in a meteor but trailed away from direction of movement. We stopped the car and got out to view this phenomenom. Again, NO SOUND. We have seen meteors, and images of reentering space junk. This was NOT like that at all. The two main trails of lights traveled parallel to one another. One trail consited of two brighter trails and could have been a third trail. It was close to the other trail. We originally thought it was an airplane having difficulty but this was not the case. Very unusual and awsome! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs. (Mountain) on Saturday, December 01, 2001.

Five Unknown Aircraft in Battle Formation Over Kansas;2004-02-20 19:30:00;10-15 minutes;Five Unknown Aircraft in Battle Formation Over Kansas On the evening of Friday, 20 February 2004, 1930 hrs, I observed five air ships/crafts, in the western sky.  The sun had gone down however, the sky was still fairly light.  As I sat on my front steps looking west, I began to examine the dark clouds that were just hovering above the homes a few miles away.  Initially, I didn't think anything about it.  Since we had mild thunderstorms the night prior, I thought the objects were lingering storm clouds.  As I continued to look in their direction (as the sky became grandually darker), the objects began to lose their cloud-like appearance.  The became metalic.  The new appearance was dark grey (very dark) however, they were not black.  I could tell that they were just a few shades lighter than a solid black color.  Their appearance was similar to that of our U.S. Military/Airforce's flat grey paint.  There were no reflective surfaces.  As I have indicated below, the crafts were in a five degree spread formation.  I will use the X to depict how they were positioned in the sky:  x     XXXXX      xxxxxxXXXXVXXXXxxxxxx      XXXXX      xxxxxxXXXXVXXXXxxxxxx  The single X represents what appeared to be a cubed like craft--it was the smallest of the five.  The five X's represent what appeared to be a tubular craft.  The most interesting, were the larger crafts.  These were shaped (from my vantage point) similar to that of a hawk or eagle as it floats in the sky awaiting prey.  If you were to take a head-on shot of either bird prior to its dive, that is what this larger craft looked like.  These larger craft was positioned firmly in the sky, traveling about 5-6 mph.  The wings of the craft were flapping slowly, much like a bird of prey.  The wings were several hundred yards long (tip to tip).  As I called my wife to help me identify these crafts, each craft began to slowly fade.  When my wife walked to the steps, the smaller craft took-off.  From the nearly motionless position, to several thousand miles per hour (much like a shooting star).  My wife screamed.  The tubular craft on the far right, began to slowly fade.  Then, the larger craft on the far right began to fade.  The transition was slow and deliberate.  The tubular craft on the far left, began to fade once the larger craft on the right faded.  The last remaining craft (one of the bird like crafts), just seem to sit there.  I got the impression that it knew we were stairing at it.  We could feel something staring back at us.  I wanted to get a better look, since we couldn't find a camera.  We jumped in our vehicle, and drop up the hill toward where the final craft was positioned.  Once we got there, it began to fade as well.  We saw the final transition.  It went from an extremely large bulky craft to a transparent (which isn't a adequate expression).  The craft appeared to blend into the sky.  We could now see a camouflaged craft that had lights/dim orange lights completely surrounding the outline of its shape.  The lights were very orange.  What was once a bulky bird-like craft, became fluid limber well camouflaged craft that seemed to glide much like a stingray in the ocean.  It was like watcing fluid in motion as this craft twirled (as if it were displaying its prowess) in the sky.  Within a second, it went straight up, and was gone.  Needless to say, my wife and I could not do anything else for the rest of the night.  We just sat there watching the sky.  One interesting point, when we were jumping into the vehicle to chase the craft, we decided to take the family dog.  The dog didn't want to go outside (this is a dog that runs to the door when it hears the lock click--he's always game for the outdoors).  He was scared of something.  My background is military, two science degrees, own businesses, and consider myself normal (both mentally and pysically).  My wife has a science background, and is an executive with a prominent medical corporation.  We are a grounded family.  These things were real, and there was a threat present.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
Two Dark Heagon shape crafts slowly decend out of clouds from west and turn north  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;2009-10-15 14:00:00;2 Minutes;Two Dark Heagon shape crafts slowly decend out of clouds from west and turn north  500 Lights On Object0: Yes In the fall of 2009, I was sitting on my best friend back deck, when he pointed up and said “what the hell is that?”  As I looked up, a second object faded into view just to the right of the first object – the sky was overcast with a ceiling of about 4000 feet.  At first we thought it was two parachutes or parasails because of the odd end-on view we had.  As they got closer, we could see all the detail – black hexagons with a section missing from the leading edge.  At one point they were about 2000 feet overhead and turning towards the north.  I could hear and see other small planes in the area going to the local airport south of the area.  These things made absolutely no sound, were at least 75 feet in diameter, and maybe moving only 25mph.  We both sketch out what we saw independently and then compared to make sure we both saw the same thing.  We did. I just took my drawing and built it in Google Sketch. I grew up an Air-Force brat, I’ve been an amateur astronomer all my life, I’ve seen things most people would mistake for a UFO. These were really Unidentified Flying Objects.  The reason I am reporting this now, is there was an article in the KC Star two weeks ago about the increase in UFO sighting in the KC area. I too have seen something - extraordinary.   I hope it’s “OURS”. It would explain why “they’ve” cancelled the Shuttle Program – we don’t need it.  If not? I hope they’re friendly, not hungry or kinky.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
Rippled Lights in the Western Sky near Olathe, KS;2012-04-24 22:00:00;1.5 hours;Rippled Lights in the Western Sky near Olathe, KS Last night (10:30 PM 4/24/12) my older son (26) and 2 of his friends were outside and witnessed a form of light that rippled across the sky from the west. It mimicked the ripples of a stone being thrown into a body of water. He said it happened at least 10 times.  Later that night-- around midnight -- my younger son (18) saw bright white lights in his room, much like camera flashes.  One was over his chest area as he lay in bed, one was near his window and the third was at the foot of his bed coming up from the floor.  Needless to say he was freaked out. He got out of bed and went outside in the driveway to see if there was a storm approaching, thinking that it might be lightening.  The sky was clear last night for the exception of one cloud that my son saw while he stood in the driveway.  It was in the southwestern sky and he said that it was emitting white horizontal flashes --nothing like typical lightening and NO thunder.  I would love to know if anyone else s! aw these lights last evening.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
Atmospheric battle;2012-07-07 01:00:00;3 minutes;Atmospheric battle I was sitting outside on the deck and enjoying the cooler weather that had blown in along with cloud cover.  I suddenly saw two bright, unusual lights in the sky to the South, but above the clouds.  One was an oval and it was to the right, while the other was more Phoenix} shaped.  They hovered and appeared to be extremely high in the atmosphere.  Suddenly, a third light appeared above the other two, and within 30 seconds, there were bright flashes between the 3 &quotlights.&quot  The lights were visible in a triangular pattern and the lower two appeared to be stricken/hit/disabled.  The upper light disappeared instantly after the firefight while the Phoenix shape seemed to disintegrate rapidly and the sphere slowly faded.  I have witnessed several other &quotstrange&quot events in the sky, but felt like I was watching a Stargate episode play out in my back yard.;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
Unknown falling/drifting object West of Olathe, Kansas.;2014-08-01 11:30:00;4-5 minutes;Unknown falling/drifting object West of Olathe, Kansas. White or shiny object drifting slowly down.   Don't know size of object to help judge the altitude and distance, but I would say first observed at 15,000' and following it slowly down to approx. 3,000' when it was lost visually due to white cloud background.  First witness said she heard jet noise then looked west and saw a jet climbing somewhat vertical.   After jet disappeared from sight she looked a little south and saw the object in question.   I skydive and would compare it to a cutaway parachute drifting down with no real pattern and at a fairly slow rate.   We watched it for 4 or 5 minutes before losing sight.  Contacted FAA FSDO office.  He contacted KC Center and New Century Tower and neither had any reports.   Air traffic in vicinity was warned of potential object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
