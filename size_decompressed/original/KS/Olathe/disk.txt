When I opened the sunroof my eyes were facing forward and then it was suggested to me to look straight up and I saw the UFO.;2008-12-30 14:20:00;30 to 40 seconds;12-30-08  At 2:20 pm I was in my car on the 119th overpass above I-35 and I was waiting for the stoplight to change to green.  I had felt an urge or suggestion from Iâ€™m not sure, to open the sunroof.  When I opened the sunroof my eyes were facing forward and then it was suggested to me to look straight up and I saw the UFO.   The UFO was moving to the East and I was facing West.  It seemed to slow down and then moved in the direction of the arrow again.  It looked similar and yet different then your usual saucer shape for it was three connected saucer shapes.  Now picture in your minds eye the three saucer shapes and 1 was double in size and picture it was at 12:00 on a clock.  The 2nd saucer shape was at 3:00 and the 3rd saucer shape was at 5:00 and they were connected with connectors that where half the width of a saucer.  Now follow me on this one. 1st one connected coming out at 5:00 and connecting to the second one at 10:00 and 2nd one coming out at 7:00 and connected to the 3rd one at 12:00.   I knew immediately that it was an alien craft of some sort for it was not emitting an exhaust like from a jet and because of the way it looked.  What came to me next was that this is the real deal! I remember thinking that it was way up there for I did a finger and thumb crazy measuring (like kids in the hall- Crushing your head sequence) and it was about a half of an inch.   I know that sounds crazy but I wanted to put some sort of perspective on and then it disappeared and I was yelling and laughing and saying I got to call D, J, and H!!!!! This is awesome!;38.8792306306308;-94.7968585585586
