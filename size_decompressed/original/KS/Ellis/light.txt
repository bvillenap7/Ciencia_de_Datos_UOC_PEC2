I thought I was seeing an odd sort of slow motion meteor hitting the atmosphere and then as I saw it dim and looking like a satellite and heading in a straight line South. I told my friends that I thought it was a satellite that had just turned or I had just caught the glimpse of sunlight shining off a panel on the craft and grabed my binoculars and started to watch it race along the way satellites do when, I swear to my honor and Gods, that it turned 180% and came back to the North for a short distance and turn back South again and stopped. I was telling my friends about this as it happened. It sat there motionless for several minutes and then as suddenly as it stopped, it started off to the West and stopped and  turned and went back and forth  in several different directions, going only short distances and then would move a short distance more, stopping at points and turning the other way and I watched it do that for at least five or six minutes when it quit moving. It was blended into the sky just as a star and didn't move at all. When my friends got out of the van, I did too and three jets appeared and two of them looked to be heading in the area of sky I was watching. After that, i could spot it as it looked like a star light and i got out of my van, i could not see where it was anymore.;38.9463;-99.5301
