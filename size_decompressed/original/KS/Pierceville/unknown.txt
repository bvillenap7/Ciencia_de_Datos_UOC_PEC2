I SAW A LARGE FALLING STAR TYPE OBJECT WITH A RAINBOW COLORED TAIL SOUTHEAST OF GARDEN CITY KANSAS.;2005-10-27 19:30:00;20-30 SECONDS;I SAW A LARGE FALLING STAR TYPE OBJECT WITH A RAINBOW COLORED TAIL SOUTHEAST OF GARDEN CITY KANSAS. WELL FIRST, I AM NOT EXACT ON THE TIME COULD OF BEEN HALF AN HOUR FORWARD OR BACKWARD OF THAT TIME.  I DO NOT NECESSARILY THINK THAT THIS WAS ANY CRAFT, BUT MORE RESEMBLED A LARGE FALLING STAR, THAT BURNED FOR ALOT LONGER THAN ANY STAR I'VE EVER SEEN FALL.  ALSO THE TAIL BEHIND IT WAS LONGER THAN FALLING STARS, MUCH MORE VIVID, AND RAINBOW COLORED, MAYBE NOT ALL COLORS, BUT ENOUGH THAT I CAN'T NAME THEM, ALTHOUGH I DO REMEMBER RED ORANGE YELLOW AND WHITE.   MY THOUGHT WAS MAYBE A METERORITE, OR PLANE CRASH?  I WAS WAS ON HIGHWAY FIFTY EAST OF GARDEN CITY,  AT THE BIG CURVE RIGHT BEFORE THE END OF THE AIRPORT RUNWAY GOING APPX EAST  SOUTHEAST AROUND THE CURVE WHEN THE LIGHTS STARTED FARELY HIGH IN THE SKY OUT MY FRONT WINDOW SO EAST AND SOUTH OF PIERCEVILLE, AND WENT DOWN AT A SOUTHWEST ANGLE AS WELL,  FOR SOME REASON I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING THERE EVEN AFTER THE LIGHT STOPPED, ALTHOUGH IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE IT I DID GET THAT IMPRESSION, AS I SAID FOR SOME REASON I'M THINKING A LARGE METEORITE OR SOMETHING,  I'M HOPING I'LL RECIEVE SOME REPLY TO THIS TO LET ME KNOW IF SOMETHING EXPLAINABLE WAS GOING OUT HERE.  I LOOKED THIS UP AFTER EVERYONE HAD GONE TO BED BECAUSE THIS THING WAS SO VIVID, AND BIG THAT I HAD TO STOP MY CAR, AND GET OUT ON THE HIGHWAY, I KNOW IT WAS SOMETHING AND NO ONE BELIEVES ME, SO AS I SAID, I'M HOPING MAYBE THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON OUT THERE, I'D SAY IF SOMETHING DID CRASH DOWN IT WOULD OF COME DOWN MAYBE SOUTH AND EAST OF DODGE CITY KANSAS.   ALSO, WHEN I GOT HOME WE WATCHED OUTSIDE, AND NOTICED AT LEAST THREE AIRPLANES OUT IN THE GENERAL VICINITY OF THE LIGHTS, AND ALTHOUGH WE DO LIVE NEAR AN AIPORT WE DON'T USUALLY HAVE THREE CIRCLING IN ONE AREA AT A TIME THAT FAR FROM THE AIPORT. i checked the i'd like to be contacted by an ivestigator box, but i don't need to be unless you know something i don't, what i really want to be contacted about is whether there was some kind of explainable thing going on out here such as an aircraft crash, or meteorite, if not any other explanations, i've seen falling stars, and this was way way more impressive, scary, and memorable.;37.9094;-100.7516
