Bright multicolored craft moving across the sky.;2017-10-18 02:30:00;1 hour;Bright multicolored craft moving across the sky. Watched a bright ball slowly move across the sky with a couple random “sprints”.  It would randomly alternate color from a bright white to a deep red.  There was no pattern in the time each color was held or the colors it changed too.  I had gone out side to smoke while I talked to a buddy on the phone, I noticed an abnormally bright “star” on the left side of a radio tower.  I chalked it up to nothing, after about 10 minutes I looked up and noticed it had moved to the right side of the pole and was no pulsing with different colors.  As I watched it returned to a pale yellow.  I continued to watch as it would occasionally “sprint” a short distance.  This went on till my cousin showed up about 30 minutes into the experience.  We watched till his shift ended (county sheriff) and he returned home.  I went back inside as it was a bit chilly.;37.4403;-100.0046
