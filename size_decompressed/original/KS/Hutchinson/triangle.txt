The craft appeared and flew over than dissappeared.;2003-09-19 22:30:00;20 seconds;The craft appeared and flew over than dissappeared. I was staring at the stars when I noticed that three were moving in a perfectly triangular pattern. I pointed it out to my two friends and they saw the strange aircraft moving. It was either fairly small flying at a low altitude or large at a high altitude. It was shaped like a triangle with two sides longer than the other with dim lights that looked like stars in each corner. It was going very fast and made no noise, when it left it just kind of faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed the three satellites that fly in formation, and which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite surveillance system.

Big, silent V-shaped craft with about 8 circle shaped  very dark dimmed lights or windows fly over home.;2006-10-27 20:00:00;6-7 seconds;Big, silent V-shaped craft with about 8 circle shaped  very dark dimmed lights or windows fly over home. My husband and I were looking at the stars on our balcony roof (1st level landing outside our bedroom window) when I noticed a V-shaped craft hovering or moving our way very slowly so, I tapped my husband to look where I pointed which was above us at about a 60% angle from the ground to the top of the house (my house being 90%) and it continued to move slowly south directly over our home until out of sight.  My husband stood up quickly to try and follow it with his eyes but lost location.  The phenomena lasted 6 to 7 seconds.  The craft looked as if the lights were turned off or dimmed very dark although, I could see the v-shape and the circle shapes on each side about 8-9 lights or windows.  I definately know this was not a bird migration sighting it was something I've never seen before.  It was large or could have been closer than I thought.  There was no sound from the craft. I felt like the pilot of the craft and maybe the occupants were checking us out then, when I noticed it started moving all of a sudden unless it was moving toward us at a very slow pace. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found her to be a seemingly exceptional witness.  PD));38.0996970149254;-97.9065761194031
V-Shaped craft moving south over Home in Hutchinson Kansas.;2006-10-27 20:00:00;6.0 sec;V-Shaped craft moving south over Home in Hutchinson Kansas. My wife and I were sitting on our roof at 8:00 p.m. just star gazing when she noticed the V shaped craft heading south about 2000 to 3000 feet up.  She hit me on the shoulder and said look at that!   I looked and it was right above us, moving very stealth-like. It looked like it had dim lights on it and really all you could see was the outline of the shape. There wasn't any sound coming from the craft and no bright lights.  We lost site of it after it went over our house. It looked huge.  The craft seemed very low and close. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the wife.  Please see her report, too, and please see the illustration on the NUFORC homepage.  PD));38.0996970149254;-97.9065761194031
