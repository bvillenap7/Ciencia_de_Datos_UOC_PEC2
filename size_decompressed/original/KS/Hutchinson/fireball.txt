Five Very large fireballs right over our neighborhood.;2007-07-04 23:30:00;twenty minutes;Five Very large fireballs right over our neighborhood. July fourth, Hutchinson Ks. At first a fireball near about a thousand feet high. It slowly moved away then was unseen. As we were leaving another showed then was gone just as fast. As we turned down a street a block away we noticed two fiery balls this time. About eight hundred feet above us this time.( nothing like I’ve ever seen, it was like you could really see flames pulsating off of the craft) As they were moving closer the one trailing the other moved down amazingly fast then swooped in front of the other. One would speed up fast then the other and on and on. Never once could you hear a noise coming from any direction it was a quiet night. This year the fire works in the neighborhood we were in were going amazingly high with bright beautiful colors this year. We watched them soar above all of the fireworks going off for about seven or eight minutes. When they got close enough you could see a fireball in the center and a beautiful orange haze like you get around street lights when it rains. I’ve heard stories and seen videos before but this made me a true believer, I’ll probably never see anything like it again in this small town. We’re pretty much smack dab in the middle of the US. 	There is nothing that could move like these objects did but a UFO. They were right above us and in less than ten minutes they were tiny little specs in space. We counted five fireballs in a time span of twenty minutes, the weirdest thing is I took some video of the second one we saw and when I went to show my mother there was nothing on the screen. It just wasn’t there.;38.0996970149254;-97.9065761194031
Fireball craft;2010-07-04 21:00:00;5 min;Fireball craft Moving slowly over the city just under the clouds.  There was a light rain that evening but we could clearly see that sometimes it would look like it would stop then kinda move in different directions like it was scanning for something.;38.0996970149254;-97.9065761194031
Brilliant Red Object At Level Altitude Sighted Over Hutchinson, KS at 9:10PM CST On July 4th, 2010.;2010-07-04 21:10:00;Appx 5-8 Minutes;Brilliant Red Object At Level Altitude Sighted Over Hutchinson, KS at 9:10PM CST On July 4th, 2010. 30-second video captured by Canon PowerShot A95 still camera in motion video mode.  Object was sighted for 1-2 minutes & was highly brilliant prior to getting camera trained on it.  We were facing northeast at the SW corner of 6th & Jackson.  In my view it appeared to be on a curved trajectory (like a sewing needle, beginning at the blunt end on to the point) heading towards us then vearing off due-north as it faded into the distance.  It appeared to be at a level altitude the entire time.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnZtAnjFIos  Video was acquired late & not on a true motion video camera, it is visible as simply a red dot.;38.0996970149254;-97.9065761194031
