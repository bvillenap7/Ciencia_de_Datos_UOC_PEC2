Craft came from East Northeast moving West Southwest toward Wichita.  Craft was a ball of creamy yellow light fifteen in diameter two thousand feet in altitude.  No sound.  Slow movement with pauses in speed yet kept moving steadily with slight side movements.   Odd: a fixed-wing plane coming from the South East intersected its flight path.
