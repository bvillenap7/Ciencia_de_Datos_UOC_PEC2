It was dusk and an object appeared that caught every one's eye in the car.  It was my husband and 2 15 year old girls and my self.   The object was above the tree line and was coming at us.  It was dark and much wider than an airplane it had no lights.   My husband's company owns several planes and he is familiar with models and flies weekly for his job.  We are wondering what is was.   We traveled west for about a mile with this object in sight.  It diapperaed below the tree line.  It was like it was headed straight for us and then was gone.   This was unusual large shape and was extremely wide and had a different movement than an airplane. Also a plane or balloon would have had some type of lights.;38.0996970149254;-97.9065761194031
