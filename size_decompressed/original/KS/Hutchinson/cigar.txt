Ufos becom Ifos;1974-06-30 14:00:00;2 hours/next day 5 minute;Ufos becom Ifos We were driving west on a lonely Kansas highway in about 1974. We spotted a cigar shape object that was silver and fit all the stereotypes. We watched it while going west. It was in the sky for a long time. It turned and revealed itself to be a jet airplane. The next day we were returning to Hutchinson. We were going down to town on a westside road when we spotted a number of people jumping out of cars. We saw another item in the sky like we had seen the day before. We knew what it was. Next day, the local paper had this headline as far as can be remembered:UFO Sighted by Hutchinson Residents. The dates may not be exact, but this event did occur.;38.0996970149254;-97.9065761194031
