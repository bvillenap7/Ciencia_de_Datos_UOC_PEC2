Non-Official aircraft (perfectly clear sky) Looked up at sky and seen what looked like a dim star but was moving very quickly across the sky.  First one we seen moved quickly across sky then faded.  We began to see another in different location and direction, dont know if it was different or same??  We seen some that would fade in and out randomly.. You could see it then you couldn't then where you'd expect it would be after continuing same path it would show up.   Within minutes of seeing all this activity of the lil dots in the sky which radiated white light,  Aircraft was popping.  So basically we didn't think it was normal for the first objects to fly that fast across sky and they didn't blink or have red light like alota air crafts are suppose to.  We also seen another that actually blinked white.  But it was very random.  It would be like blink then 10 secs later blink blink blink... No pattern what so ever.  One of the last events we can remember besides all the objects shootin around was we seen two moving that looked identical.  One stopped and the other head straight towards it then there was only one and it was moving??   So the objects moved very quickly, didn't flash like normal aircraft and if it did it was very random.  The objects would change course and path very easily.  3-5 planes were seen within 5-8 minutes of activity.  We seen what coulda been a joining of two objects, we didn't actually see em join though. Just two objects meet and only looked like one after.   And the one object that was flashing kinda flickered to it, bluish sometimes and redish sometimes, coulda been my eyes thought..;37.0431454545454;-95.6334727272727
