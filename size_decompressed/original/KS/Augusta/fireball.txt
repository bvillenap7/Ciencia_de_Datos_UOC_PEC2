Distant lights cross the Stars in Kansas,They Weave and Glow,What are They?;2000-05-20 00:00:00;6 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  The descriptions of the lights passing across the sky are stronly reminiscent of satellites.  The time, direction, and duration are all consistent with satellites.  We have no explanation for why they would cause dogs to howl, but that may be a coincidence.  We do not know what time the witness has in mind when he enters 2175 hrs..  There is no such time on the military clock.)) Distant lights cross the Stars in Kansas,They Weave and Glow,What are They? These objects crossed the sky from west to east and they flew across at intervals of about 3 minutes between each object, and objects took about  1 minute to cross the sky from horizon to horizon, then another would appear. The objects were at an extremely high altitude perhaps   10,000 to  45,000 feet  so that of course not visible except for the dim yellowish to orange glow,,, they seemed to weave in and out and to slow slightly but always kept a general course of west to east. There was one which flew from north to south. These  objects only had one light and it changed intensity slightly and all exhibited a  weaving motion instead flying in straight lines like most aircraft.  Also when the second brighter orange light passed over, the dogs around a  2 square mile area and across the river , began to howl ,,,but it was a strange howl like they were real scared , not like they were howling at the moon, but like they sensed it passing over, then they stopped as it disappeared to the east into the darkness.;37.6845;-96.9682
