I thought there May have been a tornado on ground for about 25 min and it moved on as well as the power went off!  Been without power since about 5 pm, me and room mate went out side to catch cooler air!  I happen to look up out to the south and saw a bright light no navigation lights, no anti collision light moving NE  (Me) Retired USAF/US Navy Vet.  USAF Crash Fire Fighter/US Naval Aaviation!  Then notice two other dimly lit objects smaller in size following the larger and could have been at different altitude and the same no nav light and no collision lights which are required! The speed was slow , no noise all three headed North East ???????   We did see a couple of normal aircrft with collision lights on and Nav lights! ( Note)  The object came from the direction of the old Forbes AFB now Forbes Field Air National Guard KC-135s!  During last summer I have also heard Jet Eng noise fly over but could not see a aircaft during day light not far from the base!  We both saw them so either a secret air craft or a UFO as in TR3B !  Anybody else see it in the TOPEKA, Kansas or No. Kansas City Kansas /MO  after the storm ????;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
