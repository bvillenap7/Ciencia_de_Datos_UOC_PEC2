Myself and two other people were driving along one of the main streets in our town at night, approximately 9:00 p.m.  We looked up in the sky and noticed something zooming around very quickly.  It had 3 lights on it, and the shape appeared to be triangular.  The lights blinked alternately.  It was zipping around almost twice as fast as I'd ever seen any other aircraft move, and soon it darted behind some trees.  That was the last I saw of it.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
Me and my husband saw a triangular UFO very closely in KS. It was losing control, then regained and took off.;2002-09-01 20:30:00;15 minutes;Me and my husband saw a triangular UFO very closely in KS. It was losing control, then regained and took off. I think it was late summer or start of fall, in 2002. We were visiting family at my husbands sisters house, then me and him left in my car to go get food for everyone, it was about 8:30 PM.  We were in a pretty suburban area. Houses on blocks, apartments, a YMCA right near by. We were driving along a straight stretch and my husband said oh my goodness that plane is gonna crash. I thought he was joking told him playfully to shut up and then he said no seriously. I looked in my rear view mirror and saw a large black object coming overtop of a hill behind us. It was sort of wobbling side to side like it was about to lose control, and it was dangerously low and close to the power lines, then it seemed to sort of start getting control again. I stopped my car right in the middle of the street, there was no other traffic around. I turned around and started looking out the back window. It was going very slow and then about not even 200 feet behind my car it stopped and started to just hover. I was like a straight up triangular shape looked almost as if you drew a big letter A, standing straight up in the sky. It was black very sleek and on one side it was completely covered with lights, green, red and yellow. They were all blinking and there had to be 200 hundred of them. We just set there in awe. Then all of a sudden it took off. It left so fast you could almost see lines in the air after it (another strange thing I noticed when it took off it made no sound at all, any other aircraft you would have heard take off noise, it just zipped off with nothing). I just went on impulse through my car into drive and tried to follow. I was going about 90 mph trying to follow it. I saw a ramp unto the highway and by the time I got up on the highway we could only barely see the lights of the UFO way off in the distance. When we got back to his sisters house I couldn't help but try to tell them what we had seen. NO one believed us. So, we haven't really talked about it since. Has anyone else seen a UFO like that?

The object dived into the ground.  ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether this is a serious report.  PD));2006-09-29 21:00:00;About seven miniutes;The object dived into the ground. Ok, here's how it goes.  My college professor and I were outside having a discussion about Orion and it's surrounding orbits when something slowly coming from the east caught my attention.   At first I thought it was the nightly police helicopter doing patrol, but this was different.  It didn't make any sound, but still it had some sort of essence coming from it that gave my professor and I a feeling of ecstacy.   We couldn't divert our attention from it.   It was almost as if something was purposefully making us continue to stare at it.  When I tried to look away, I felt sick to my stomach, and extremely dizzy, and my professor had the same feelings as I.  This went on for what seemed like hours, until something happened to this day that makes me sit back and analyze life.  With a sudden sharp shriek almost identical to that of a wounded animal, the craft burst into light did two counter lockwise barrel rolls then dove straight down into the ground, in the fild about 100 yards away.   After we both gathered ourselves, my professor and I went to the field exactly where it had dived.  When we got there we were both amazed at what we saw, for it was not earthly possible.  There was absolutly no sign of disruption to the ground at all, and the only thing that really seemed out of place was a dense smoke above our heads that honestly smelled quite pleasent.  When we both got pass the shock, we decided to walk on, and never tell a sole...But walking wasn't so easy, because the rubber soles on our shoes were melted.

Double aqua green corner cap lights to narrow triangle, brief sighting - but I know what I saw.;2006-12-01 18:45:00;5-6 seconds;Double aqua green corner cap lights to narrow triangle, brief sighting - but I know what I saw. While driving west on 29th street about 2 blocks east of Fairlawn Rd. I glanced out and up of the passenger side window of my car.  I have no idea why I did this because I had to bend down to look up at the sky to see this.   I saw three sets of double aqua green lights in the shape of a narrow triangle.  I could detect no movement and appeared to be hovering.  The double lights capped each corner of the triangle, and the inside light was a little longer than the outside light.   There was no circular red light in the middle of the triangle and I couldn't make out a solid interior.  It appeared to be about the size of a small house and was very low to the ground, I can only guess but maybe 200 to 300 ft. up.  I rolled down all my windows to see if I could hear any engine noise but hear nothing other than traffic.  I pulled forward to the red light at Fairlawn Rd. and came to a stop, I tried to look back out the passengers window and could see nothing.  I crossed the road and looked again--nothing.  I tried several more times to see as I came to the grocery store at 21st and Belle. I got out of the car in the parking lot and scanned the sky but I couldn't find what I had seen. I have never seen anything like this before it was amazing.  It wasn't like the triangles that were seen in Belgium and Illinois.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
Not a real believer, but what were those lights.;2007-10-06 01:00:00;3 Seconds;Not a real believer, but what were those lights. This probably isn't anything to get in a stir about. I was outside having a beer.  And when I am outside I have a tendency to look up to view the jets fly by.  Kansas City airport has aircraft fly out all the time and I usually say to myself  Well that should be me.  That approximate night, I looked up and saw the clouds.  They were normal no big deal.  Then the clouds illuminated just a bit.  One of 3 lights came through them, the lights rotated and went back up into the clouds. Nothing else has happend but I rarely go out and check anyways.  Not a big thing on the top of my list. It could be something else like a helicopter.  But by my estimations.  One of the lights could probably fit two or three heli's inside.  And the clouds were very high up as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
Orange object of July 4, 2010, in Topeka, Kansas;2010-07-04 21:30:00;2 minutes;Orange object of July 4, 2010 in Topeka, Kansas On July 4th, 2010, I witnessed a bright orange object moving west to east over Topeka, Kansas.  I observed this at approximately 9:30 pm CDT.   I live in an area where air traffic is common (near Forbes Field) where the 190th Air National Guard Refueling is located.  It is not uncommon to see Refueling aircraft fly over, as I live close to the flight path.  I know what an aircraft looks like at close range and what I saw was not an aircraft (plane or helicopter).  I first observed this object and quickly noticed it was unusual.   At first it appeared to be a meteor. I called to another family member to come see this object.  It was a bright orange and appeared to be somewhat triangular to diamond shaped.  It was hard to distinguish an exact dimension or shape because it appeared to be flying in a haze or smoke from fireworks.   Our weather that evening had been stormy/humid and there appeared to be some fog or haze in the sky.  However, the object was first vis! ible many miles away, and was clearly seen, so I am not sure why there appeared to be this haziness to the object when it was overhead.   As I stated earlier, the object was moving from due west to due east.  It flew directly overhead.  It was hard to determine its height, because I really couldn't determine its size and make a relationship guess, but it appeared to be 800-1000 feet high.  Again, because it was difficult to determine size and height, its speed is only an estimate...approximately 300-400 mph.   Again, I watch aircraft coming and going from Forbes Field (mostly shortly before landing and after take-off), and I'm judging the speed of this object in relationship to those observations.  I heard no sound from the object at any time.  I observed the object for 30-40 seconds, then went to a different location and watched it continue moving east for another 15-20 seconds.   It appeared to go into a cloud bank because it disappeared quickly and somewhat unexpectedly. ! It didn't just fade away but disappeared abruptly, either int! o a cloud bank or whatever.  It did not quickly change directions...just disappeared suddenly. When I first observed it, I thought it might be a meteor.  It's speed, however, was too slow and it was relatively close to the ground.  There was no tail or anything that trailed behind.   My immediate impression was that I had seen something I couldn't explain.  I thought, because so many people were out with fireworks that evening, that I would here something about this on the local news that night or the next day.  I've heard nothing...until out of curiousity I Googled it.   I had been thinking that all those drugs as a kid finally had taken its toll and I was seeing things..lol.  Anyway, I was somewhat releived to see that other shared the same experience.   Hopefully this description will help you. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me and I will try to better explain my observations.   Good luck.....;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436

It was December, 28, 2011 10:30 pm. I was taking my dog outside and I sat on my stairs to enjoy the cold air. I was looking at the sky when all of a sudden I see something in the sky. I was flying kind of low in the sky and I knew it wasn't an airplane cause it didn't look like it or sound like it and I know airplanes don't fly that low. It had a sound that didn't sound like and airplane or a helicopter and it was a sound I never heard before. And it had a flashing red light and it looked like it was about to land somewhere. While it was flying across the sky I didn't take my eyes off of it. After it disappeared, for about 15 minutes I was trying to figure out if it was an helicopter or a UFO.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436

They produced a constant flashing, which to me is easly identifiable as aircraft.  As they flown for a few seconds I noticed a third appear.  Showing three lights in a triangler shape.  This object was flying in the north to north western direction. When watching this, one of the eastern flying aircraft did a U turn and starting flying west.  Focusing on the north northwestern flying object, it began to rotate in a corkscrew motion.  At this moment I attempted to grab my cell phone but as the western aircraft pasted infront of the other object it faded into black or just got to far away to see. Both other aircraft continued on thier paths. The movement of this third object was to quick and erratic with two other references to see at the same time.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436

It had 3 greenish blue lights. I drove to the parking lot of fritolay and parked. The object was slowly going up in the air, hovering for about 15 to 20 seconds,then going down below the tree line. It did this 4 times until it went below the tree line and did not come back up. It was approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile north west of Forbes Field.
