bright star like light, moves unlike nothing ive ever heard about;2010-02-12 23:00:00;several days;bright star like light, moves unlike nothing ive ever heard about I have seen it a few nights not back to back.  I believed it to be a star but it was brighter and yellow.  then i thought it to be a satelite or a plane.  It moved like neither.  It changes directions on a dime and moves very fast for short distances unlike anything i believe our technology has produced.  the part i cant understand is the way it changes directions.  it has been in a few locations and tends to move around.  i usually find it around the little dipper though.  the movements are very subtle though,  it may take u awhile to find it.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
3 light object by Lake Shawnee sitting completely still, then vanished.;2014-05-27 09:20:00;5 minutes;3 light object by Lake Shawnee sitting completely still, then vanished. Was driving down 29th street and seen a 3 light object sitting completely still, it was in the middle of 29th street, and 32nd street by West edge road.  I pulled over to look at it, it wasn't moving, then I got back in my car and headed towards it to get a closer parking spot by the lake and it was gone.  Wish I would of stayed at my original spot to see it leave.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
Three lights in formation;2020-08-19 21:00:00;5 minutes;Saw three lights in linear formation, and thought at first it might have been an approaching plane.  No sound, and two of the three lights in formation began pulsating.  Rounded a corner in the road, around a treeline, and hoped to get a closer view.  Formation was gone.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
