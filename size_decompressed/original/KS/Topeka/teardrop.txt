strange object in the sky;2009-05-30 18:30:00;just a couple seconds at ;strange object in the sky I have been a UFO observer and researcher of alien life for as long as I can remember but never found the proof of existence until May 30th, 2009.  It was approxamaitly 6:30pm and my brother and I were driving north on I75.  It was a bright day so I wore my contact lenses and sunglasses..(very important key fact to the incident)  At the time, the highway curved northwest near the gave exit from 470 to I75.  I could see a shining metalic shape in the sky.  I couldn't say if it was more oval or teardrop shaped.  In a split second from seeing it, I removed my sunglasses to see it.  I could not see it but didn't have a clue as to why.  When I put the sunglasses back on, I caught a small glimpse of it and it just vanished.  I don't know if it seriously vanished or moved at such a high speed that I didn't catch it quick enough.  I scanned the skies and saw 3 planes in the sky.  They must have been comerical jets as there were no formation, which led me to believe there was no chase involved.  The planes were evident due to the contrails and they were visible with out the sun glasses.  After careful thought, I considered the idea that this metalic shape could not be seen with out the sun glasses because while with the sun glasses, the color mimiced that of the day time sky.  Sort of a camafloge so to speak.  I referenced it to my brother, but he is a non believer in such things and dismissed the thought.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
