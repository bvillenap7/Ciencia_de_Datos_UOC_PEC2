I cannot possibly begin to put it all in this little space. PLEASE go to my site I put down there and just read my diary. At the request of Dr.John Mack, (a ufo reseacher)who I went to see when he gave a talk in KC, I went and got tested at the KU Med Center in Kansas City, where they had a UFO research dept there, headed up by Dr. Fowler Jones (who will verify this) Everything I have on my site is true, but unfortunately, I do not have any pics. I have had numerous abduction experiences as a result of all this. My checkmarks are only for the first one that I saw.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
I was driving north and saw a silver disc in the northern sky.;2003-10-30 07:00:00;5 minutes;I was driving north and saw a silver disc in the northern sky. I was driving north when I noticed in the northern sky a large military plane.  Then I noticed a silver disk higher in the sky and east of the plane.  I could see the military plane moving away from me but the silver disk was not moving at all.  I drove to a place where I could park my car and watched the disk.  It started to move slowly to the west.  I got back in the car and drove the 4 blocks to my house.  When i got there,  the disk was gone.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
On May 14, 2004, I saw a black, disk shped craft come out of a cloud bank  and fly low over a park and a shopping center in Topeka, KS.;2004-05-14 20:00:00;2 hours;On May 14, 2004, I saw a black, disk-shaped craft come out of a cloud bank and fly low over a park and a shopping center in Topeka, KS. The object, a saucer shaped craft, appeared to come out of a cloud bank to the west of a city park in south Topeka, Kans. This occurred shortly after sunset while there was still twilight in the west. The craft flew due east in my direction - I was seated on a picnic table next to a softball field and close to home plate. The craft flew fast and low over the ball field at an altitude of 15-20 feet and passed by me at a distance of about 150 feet to the south of me. It passed underneath an electric line running along the right field line and under another line that ran along the center field fence. It then left the ball field and climbed to pass over a building in an apartment complex, located on the east side of the ball field. The craft then dropped out of sight on the other side of the building. I continued to look in the direction of the apartments. Less than a minute later, the craft reappeared on the north side of the apartments, directly to the east of me. It then rose to an altitude of about 50 feet and slowly moved toward me.  It passed to the north of me at a distance of 100 feet or less from me. It then turned south and appeared to land at the south end of a parking lot, which is located on the west side of the ball field, about 150-200 feet from me. The craft then rotated to face me and then began to move toward me slowly and low over the ground. At this point I became somewhat afraid and left the park in my car. The craft was black in color and had a single white light on the front of it. Because it was getting dark, I could make out no further detail other than its shape and approximate size. I estimate the diameter of the craft to be 10-15 feet. Its shape is what I would describe to be a classic saucer shape. I felt the need to go someplace where there were other people (I was alone in the park), so I drove to a Walmart store, located about three blocks east of the park. As I entered the parking lot, I saw a white light flying eastward to the south of Walmart. It then made a large U turn and flew directly over Walmart at an altitude of less than 100 feet and then headed southwest and disappeared. I went into Walmart for about 10 minutes to make a purchase. When I came out, I saw a white light flying circles, altitude of 100 feet or less, over an apartment complex located just east of Walmart. I am assuming this white light was the saucer I saw earlier at the park, but the body of the craft wasn't visible at this point because the sky was too dark. As far as I knew, I was the only witness to the craft's activities. I went to a tavern located in a strip mall just northeast of Walmart to find someone I knew who could be a witness. Unfortunately, I didn't know any of the people who were in the tavern at that time. I stayed at the tavern for a time, occasionally stepping outside to see if the craft was still in the vicinty and saw it again on two more occasions. Both times, I saw it hovering over the east end of Walmart at a height of 75-100 feet. The first time, the craft began to move toward the southeast and then turned north. It passed low over the apartment complex and then over a service station. The body of the craft was briefly visible as it passed over the service station. The craft continued north and then made a sharp turn west. I then lost sight of it. I went back into the tavern and came out again about 15-20 minutes later. Once more, it was hovering over Walmart in the same place. This was my final, and most bizarre, sighting of the craft. The craft began to move on the same course as before, but this time it turned directly toward me instead of passing over the service station. It came at me fast and very low over the parking lot of the strip mall, came very close to me and then simply vanished. I looked all around me, even directly above me, but couldn't see it. I have no idea where it went. Because this happened so quickly and because I was somewhat stunned by what happened, I really couldn't discern any further details of the craft's appearance. I re-entered the tavern and came out again a short time later. I didn't see the craft this time, so I went home. About me: I am a 50-year old male. I have bachelor degrees in journalism and business, with work experience in both fields. At present, I am part owner of a computer store. This was my only real encounter with a UFO. In the past, I have seen lights in the night sky that I couldn't identify, but I had never seen a flying saucer before this incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

the object spun, wobbled, and flipped over and over as it went across the sky.;2004-07-04 17:00:00;2-3 minutes;the object spun, wobbled, and flipped over and over as it went across the sky. We were shooting off fireworks and my step-daughter and husband were looking for the parachute to come back down.  My step-daughter saw it first and then my husband and myself saw it.  It was a disk that was silver on the top and a reddish brown on the bottom.  It was spinning and wobbling as it moved slowly across the sky.  It was also flipping over and over as it went.  The sun reflected off it as it flipped.  We watched it for about 2-3 minutes as it went from west to east and disappeared behind the tree line.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
