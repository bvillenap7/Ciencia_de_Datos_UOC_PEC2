At approxamately 2100 hrs on 11-23 I was a passenger in a car.  As we reached the top of a large hill I saw a white flashing object in the northern sky.  It traveled from west to east rapidly over a four second time period approxamately. It covered the whole expanse of the sky in that time.   The sky was overcast and I don't believe it was a shooting star.  I'm a forty year old housewife and have never had an experience like that before.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
