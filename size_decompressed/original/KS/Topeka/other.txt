Whitest flash of Light I've ever seen;2002-07-02 02:00:00;15 seconds;Whitest flash of Light I've ever seen I was living in Topeka, KS at the time of this event. I was driving home from work about 2am driving down my road. I was about to start breaking to pull into the driveway and all of a sudden this white light flashed right in front of me. The only way I can describe it is a HUGH sheet of the whitest white i've every seen. Lasted about 15 seconds, if that. My vision was very blurred and I couldn't adjust to the night. I was really freaked and my dogs were clearly spooked cause they took off running and barking. I stayed in my car for about 10 minutes not wanting to get out. The next day it was all over this AM radio station that talks about this kind of thing, from people around the USA, that saw the same thing.
