Blue colored circular object in the night sky.;2020-12-26 20:00:00;Approx 10 minutes;Blue colored circular object in the night sky. On December 26, 2020 I was on my patio and spotted a blue (kind of fuzzy) circular object seemingly flying in no particular pattern.  It was approximately 8 PM, dark, cold and clear, although I do not recall seeing stars that night and I don't see any in my video or pictures. I have the pictures and video on my phone but do not have the ability to e-mail them but could send by text. I just now am hearing about the sighting around Hawaii and believe it may be the same thing.  If there has been an explanation, I would appreciate a response.  Thank you;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
