Bright cylinder seen flying over Topeka during storm.;2004-08-25 18:00:00;3 - 4 minutes;Bright cylinder seen flying over Topeka during storm. I observed a bright white or silver tube shaped object flying from south to north just below the top but up next to a wall of dark storm clouds over Topeka Kansas. The object was about three times as long as it was wide but the overall size was hard to judge.  It was traveling at about the speed of an airplane but after flyng for a minute or less it stopped in the air and was stationary for a few minutes. The object was very visable against the darkness of the clouds and I could see turbulance in the clouds being blown around it which did not appear to affect it. The object then gradually faded becomming harder to see until it disappeared. I have a private pilots lisc.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
Stationary, cylindrical object with white flashing lights;2010-11-18 18:15:00;1 minute +;Stationary, cylindrical object with white flashing lights At approximately 6:15 pm on November 18, 2010, I noticed in the western sky an object that drew my attention.  It appeared to be a long, horizontal, stationary object which was blinking on and off with a pulsing rhythm.  The lights were white.   Compared to the full moon I would say it was about 5% to 10% the size of the moon.   I observed it for a minute or so, went in the house not sure what to do, tried to call a neighbor, then went back outside and the object was no longer visible.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
Pill shaped, bright object with no wings over Topeka, KS.;2014-07-06 20:50:00;1 minute;Pill shaped, bright object with no wings over Topeka KS i saw a pill shaped, shiny object flying slowly past my apartment while I was sitting outside on my lawn swing. i was reading but looking at the sky every few minutes to see what the chemtrails were doing - there were about 4 chemtrails way up in the sky (so high that i couldn't see the airplanes). all of the sudden i saw this pill shaped, really shiny object heading south. it was way lower then the chemtrails. and it was way more shiny then an airplane, almost like it was chrome reflecting the sun or white reflecting the sun. I kept looking for the wings but couldn't see any. also, the shape was not a perfect pill shape as it sort of curved in a bit in the center, so it was almost the shape of an infinity sign only not as exaggerated in the middle.  i kept trying to see the wings but never saw any. and i kept trying to tell what color it was but it was so bright (white light) that I assumed it was a chrome color reflecting the sun. but it might have been self-lit, i don't know.  i thought of running into the house to get my camera but i knew i was going to loss sight of it as my apartment faces north and it would be over my porch roof in a matter of seconds. once it got over my roof, i rushed into the apartment, grabbed my camera and rushed to the south window to see if i could shoot it. but it was nowhere in the sky. (my apartment is on the 3rd floor and i should have been able to still see it as it wasn't moving very fast.) there was no noise. I can't estimate how high it was or how big it was as I had nothing to compare it to in the sky. there were some light wispy clouds way up high and those weird chemtrails streaking across the sky but other then that it was a clear blue sky. i have seen airplanes go by and even though they are further away and higher, I can make out their wings. this one had no wings that i could see. it did not leave any kind of trail.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
