The night was clear so when I got out of my car to go inside I took a few minutes to enjoy the stars. I was looking to the south and spotted a bright light moving to what appeared to be north. I didn't think to much about it cause we have Forbes Air Base and a police helicopter in town, but what caught my eye was that it was changing colors, like most of the rainbow colors, not flashing just changing but the intensity of the light stayed the same. NOW I was wondering why our police helo was changing colors as I have never seen it do that before. It was about the same brightness as Jupiter is on a good night but slightly brighter. I watched it for about 7-10 seconds then it stopped in mid-flight. When it stopped it also stopped changing colors and changed to a VERY brilliant white light, like twice the brightness of Jupiter. That lasted about 4-5 seconds and then all at once this thing took off to the stars so fast it was gone in less than 1 second, if I had blinked I would have missed it leaving. It did not go OVER the horizon it went straight up at about a 70 degree angle to the way it was flying when I watched it before it left. It went UP INTO the stars, not leaving a trail of any kind except a light trail, the kind you see if you move a flashlight beam across a wall VERY fast. At that moment I knew it wasn't something of earth as I have seen aircraft fly all my life and none ever acted like this thing. Object was too far away to make out any shape so can't give one.

Stationary light, quickly moving away;2005-07-29 20:10:00;30 seconds;Stationary light, quickly moving away At dusk, I was walking down my driveway and happened to notice what I thought was a planet or bright star in the northern sky above the trees.  Owning and frequently using a telescope as an amateur astronomer, and recognizing that nothing should be in this portion of the sky, I stopped and looked trying to figure out what it was.  As I watched, the light began to oscilate or twinkle, then quickly grew smaller, until it could not be seen.  I was somewhat stunned, but it appeared that whatever it was moved directly away from me at amazing speed. The object was white as a planet or star, and as large as venus when it is low in the sky.  I am a male, 47, professional, and enjoy watching the nightime sky.  I have seen many things in the sky, with most easily being explained as meteortites, satalights, planes, or other conventional aircraft.  This event was unique, and quite puzzling due to the objects speed of travel.  Seeing that it was dusk, the suns rays could have still been refracting into the sky, but the light source was not consistent with a reflection.  There were other stars visible in the sky during and after the event, and several seconds after it disappeared two high flying aircraft moved into the area, but left.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
It appeared to be a quickly moving star...;2006-07-29 01:28:00;2+ hrs;It appeared to be a quickly moving star... I am an avid meteor shower observer.  I was outside hoping to see some of the Perseids and to show them to my friend.  We were both gazing in the W-NW area of the sky between these two very bright stars (staring at the dark space between them).  We have been talking and laying down watching them for quite some time when suddenly to our amazement one of the two stars moved smoothly and quickly in the N-NW direction and then focused into a single sharp point of light and disappeared.  I have no idea what it was.  We both tried to figure it out and I'm a huge skeptic of aliens and spacecraft, in fact, I do not believe in it.  So, ruling out extraterrestial, insects, bats, birds, airplanes, and helicopters, and anything that makes noise... what was it?  It looked just like the rest of the stars, white in color, though now that I'm thinking about it, it didn't have that twinkle like other stars did, or not to be knowledge anyway.  It could have been something near to outside our atmosphere, but small so that it appears to be far away such as a star.  It did not move for almost two hours (when we started to watch) and then made it's disappearing act.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
I noticed a bright light that seemed to be following at a fixed distance.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of NUFORC?  PD));2007-02-15 07:00:00;1hour;While traveling home after shopping and running a few errands, I noticed a bright light that seemed to be following at a fixed distance. It was too bright to be star/planet. It did not have the blinking lights of an aircraft, but rather a fixed bright light.  It followed parallel to me for several miles, then I took a 90 degree turn towards bright light and it continued to maintain the same distance despite traveling approximately 5 miles towards it. I took another 90 degree turn and once again it maintained a parallel flight pattern. I then took another 90 degree turn and it followed behind at a fixed distance. I repeated the rectangular pattern of travel and the light maintained an equal distance. At this point I drove straight in an attempt to outdistance the light and it grew smaller indicating that it was in fact flying relatively close to the surface.  I continued direction of travel and light grew dim, but when I made a 90 degree turn I noticed the light maintained a parallel flight pattern albeit at a greater distance than before.  I then drove toward the light once again and it then rapidly grew distant and small. It appeared that several aircraft in the area with blinking lights also may have seen the light as they were seen hovering in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of NUFORC?

I stepped out of the garage at about 4:15 or maybe 4:30 am, into my three acre heavily;2011-08-11 04:15:00;3 minutes;I was working early in my garage this morning,.  I stepped out of the garage at about 4:15 or maybe 4:30 am, into my three acre heavily wooded lot surrounding my house. The morning was crisp, low humidity and temperature probably around upper 60's.  The night sky was brilliant with no deterioration from humidity -- a great viewing opportunity if I could have set up my telescope. I then observed a bright white light on a slow moving trajectory heading on the flight path I assumed to be to the Kansas City airport (MCI) as their are many commercial planes that use that or nearly that landing / takoff path. I then looked for the blinking red indicator lights that are normally visible on commercial planes about 70 miles out from MCI.  I spotted no red blinking lights on the bright white (round) light moving east - east - south east (EESE).  I next listened for the jet engine noise. Nothing - the early morning was dead silent.  I then moved quickly down to my pond about 90 foot north of my garage door to get a better, unobstructed view and confirm this was a commercial aircraft (it was moving at what I considered a commercial jet landing speed but two to three times brighter than what I normally note as jets on their way to and from MCI). As I ran to my small pond I became convinced this was not a commercial aircraft and started shouting Hey - Hey -- Hi - Hello and with my arms above my head began waving my arms toward the moving bright light overhead.  I was very excited and almost pleased I was seeing this light disk in the sky. As the round light passed overhead I changed my opinion to the probability that this was a satellite circling the earth and catching the early morning sun from below the horizon.  There were no lights blinking from wing marker lights and absolutely no sound emanating from an internal combustion source and the path of the light was on a straight and constant velocity path to the EESE.  I had tracked enough satellites to be convinced this was another satellite and I turned around and headed back to the garage - a little disappointed - but satisfied by the brief, no harm, diversion from cleaning an autofill combo supply - check valve for my hotwater heating system. As I reached the paved parking area next to my house and in front of my garage I decided to scan for the satellite on its trajectory again (and enjoy the refreshing cool, dry morning air again) before entering the garage to continue work. To my surprise the light was moving very slowly to the SW -- as it had moved past me about 30 to 40 seconds (on same initial EESE trajectory) after I had shouted and raised my arms and waved them in the pitch black that is rural Topeka, KS.  As I popped into the open of my concrete parking area in front of the garage the light came to an instant stop also. The light had also moved back to the north in those last few seconds but was not quite overhead - but about 15 degrees south of straight overhead.  I listened for a propeller blade wash noise from a parked helicopter (the local city poilce have a helicopter that is very noisy and easily identified by its very loud engine and prop noise).  Again - absolute quiet reigned - with no normal or unusual noise being heard from this now stopped light in the sky. I continued to observe the light and did not think of yelling and waving my arms as I noticed I was now very nervous. The now still round light - if it had not sensed my presence - at least gave the highly coincidental indication that it was now going to track me.  I stared at the light in the sky (much brighter than a bright star) for about 10 seconds and the emotion grew to get away into the garage as  soon as possible -- I logically did not expect the light was anything to fear -- but the fear and seek cover emotion ruled and I could no longer control it and could not continue to observe the light in the sky. All of this happened in a three to five minute period.  Looking back on this incident both the emotional states I experienced seem highly unusual for me -- overly happy /pleased as it passed overhead the first time and then overly distraught a few minutes later with the creepy felling it was going to observe me and / or do something I would not like.  Neither emotion seems like a normal response for me. I am a engineer, naturally curious, and open to observation without emotion as I seek to analyze situations and events and not let my emotions rule. Previous events / sightings -- I have now observed this style of light flying in the sky three times that I can remember.  One as youth, one at age 41, and now this morning as a 56 year old man.  When I observed a similar style light as a 41 year old there.............dssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss were also 10 or so witnesses observing the light with me on a wilderness river boating and camping trip, one of them was my best friend.  My best friend and I discussed (for about 5 minutes or so)  the wierdness of the unusual light (flying craft) that night and then he as well as the other 10 campers went to sleep almost immediately.  I stayed awake for about 10 to 15 more minutes wondering why someone was not continuing to discuss what we had just seen -- I will just say it was repeated for us and was very, very remarkable what the light (a flying craft of some type) performed with its near infinite acceleration and agility relative to a fighter aircraft i! n the area.  When I brought the matter up with  my best friend in the morning to continue the discussion he told me that he knew of no such event had happened the night before (and I believe that is now his memory) - in fact I was the only one in the group who had any recollection of the event - everyone I approached (including my best friend) said they did not know what I was talking about.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436

Lights in the sky which I cannot explain by way of conventional means.;2014-06-21 22:00:00;2 minutes;lights in the sky which I cannot explain by way of conventional means. My wife and I walked out onto the front porch, which faces due west.  I noticed a light in the sky that was familiar to myself, but my wife had been previously unacquainted.  I pointed it out to her, and told her that it was likely to vanish, which it did, almost as if it did so in reaction to my expectation that it would.   The following evening, at a friend's house, on yet another front porch, this one facing due east, a similar light, pointed out in similar fashion, to yet another witness, reacted in kind, again, as soon as I indicated that it was likely to vanish.   The following evening, again on my front porch, the same kind of light was to the south. In this instance, the light behaved according to what appears to be normal, but after it faded to black, it reappeared, considerably brighter, and much further along in it's trek than it's speed while previously visible would have allowed.  It was almost as though it jumped across the sky, after which, it went b! ack to its predisposed M.O. and continued to the northeast.  I have been witnessing this phenomena for better than a decade, intermittently though it might be.  What was once merely the possibility that I was either crazy, or actually witnessing things that are exceedingly difficult to explain, is now somewhat substantiated, as I am no longer alone in my experience.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
Bright light like a ball shape with fire on the end of the object and flew lower than airplanes that come in to land;2014-09-18 23:00:00;In my backyard;Bright light like a ball shape with fire on the end of the object and flew lower than airplanes that come in to land I was sitting in my backyard talking with my boyfriend about something and in our backyard it is really really dark at nighttime.  All of a sudden I seen this bright light that looked to me it had some sort of flame behind it.  It was so bright that it lit up the sky till it disappeared when it went down behind the trees.  I know it wasn't a shooting star cause it would not have been as low as it was above me and my boyfriend.  And a shooting star would've moved faster than this object did.  This bright object moved slower and flew real low above us.I swear It was a ufo of some sort.  When it went behind the trees it just disappeared and was nowhere.  I looked cause like I said I knew this was no shooting star.  The only sound I heard that was faintly was the sound of the fire behind the bright object, but it was a faint sounding noise.   I wish I knew what that bright light was. Its really bugged me ever since I seen it.  It was an amazing thing to get to see.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436

Orange light turning red moving south to north, not an aircraft I am familiar with.;2016-09-10 23:30:00;20 minutes;Orange light turning red moving south to north, not an aircraft I am familiar with. At around 11:30pm myself and a friend were hanging out in the parking lot at 10th and Gage in Topeka KS.  We had been drinking coffee in the coffeehouse in that shopping center, and after the coffeehouse closed we adjourned to a picnic table that we sit and chat at often. Something caught my eye.  It was due East of our location. It was an orange or amber light moving from south to north.  If i held my fists out with my arms straight, it was about two fists, maybe two and a half fists above the horizon.  And the distance seemed to be perhaps over downtown Topeka, or maybe between downtown and the hospitals to the west of downtown.  From this I would guess the altitude of the light to be maybe 1,000 feet. If i stand facing east, the light moved to my 10:30 or 11:00 position. As it traveled it turned from orange to white to red and then disappeared. I could see no other lights. If it was some aircraft then it only had this one light on it. I could not hear any sound such as motors as if it were a helicopter. Helicopters landing at the hospitals are very audible and there is no mistaking them and their various lights. This was not a helicopter. My friend saw the same thing, once I pointed it out to him.  He went and got binoculars out of his car as the first light went out of sight.  And then another one, exactly like the first appeared in the same place that the first one had showed up, only maybe a bit further to the south, in the 1:00 position if you stand facing due east.  This light behaved exactly like the first, moving north and then turning red and disappearing.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
