One or several bright lights seen over Topeka, KS flashing, streaking and disappearing in the sky.;2009-07-21 22:00:00;hour;One or several bright lights seen over Topeka, KS flashing, streaking and disappearing in the sky. at approx 2200 i was outside smoking when i noticed a bright object that looked mu like a planet does.  The object began to move then blinked out.  A few seconds later it reappeared and streaked across the sky.  I told my wife and we went back out.  About 10 minutes later the object reappeared this time it would pulsate, then blink out then flash then blink out again moving from east to west.   After it blinked out for the last time a second object (may have been same one unsure) appeared back in the firsts original location and did the same thing in the exact same path before streaking off like a shooting star.   After about another half an hour the object appeared once more this time moving in the opposite path as it originally did then blinked out, about ten minutes went by and it appeared for the last time this time it was much brighter before blinking out and not coming back.   From where I was sitting all of the objects were moving around and in the square part of the big dipper (it did move out of the formation but that is where I spotted it each time at the beginning).   Each time it was spotted several aircraft would circle the area to include a helicopter that I heard but could not see.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
Fireball that simply vanished;2010-08-18 21:40:00;2 minutes;Fireball that simply vanished I was taking out some trash at approximately 9:40 PM CST on Wed Aug. 18th.  I scanned the skies. I saw in the southern sky, I would say about 3 miles away at a 30-40 degree angle from horizon an orange ball moving slowly across the sky.  I watched it for about 20 sec and I couldn’t make out any blinking lights that indicated it was a plane, so I watched it about 10 more seconds.  At that point I made a decision to go inside and grab my astronomy binoculars to have a better look. I was able to find the orange ball in the binoculars.  I wanted to make sure I had focused them correctly, so I was adjusting one of the eye pads, keeping the binocs on the object.  The object was glowing orange, but had some red and white in it as well.  As I was adjusting and watching this move across the horizon it faded out and then got brighter, and then it just vanished.  Was not seen in the sky anywhere. It was simply gone. What made me pay attention to it in the very beginning was that it was very similar to some red/orange balls I witnessed on July 4th at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri.   To me it didn’t act like a plane or helicopter.  It was an orange glowing ball slowly making its way across the horizon and it simply blinked and then disappeared.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
Object lights up sky then large fireball;2010-11-22 03:00:00;3 seconds;Object lights up sky then large fireball It was about 3am and I woke up and went to the restroom and then got a drink.  I looked at the clock then closed my eyes to go back to sleep.  I sleep facing a large patio door that is covered with light blocking drapes.   To my surprise seconds after closing my eyes I awoke to brilliant light as if it was daytime outside.  Then a large orange fireball seemed to float across the sky outside my patio door. The ball disappeared and my room returned to darkness.  Shaken I went and opened the drapes and the door.  It was quiet outside and dark. No sign of the light or large ball the followed.  Not even a sound during this event.  I am not sure if it was a meteor but it sure scared the hell out of me.   To my surprise I checked the news to see if anyone else reported seeing this and nothing was reported.  I live in SE Topeka near Lake Shawnee.  I was really surprise that no one else seen this.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
Bright, fast moving object over my head became even brighter before blinking out;2011-04-22 22:00:00;3 sec;Bright, fast moving object over my head became even brighter before blinking out Was taking dog out before bed, at approx. 10pm, Friday April 22.  I always look up. Noticed 2 smaller objects in the northern horizon, which seemed low from what I recall that there should be.   Then my attention was directed up over me to a very bright, fast moving, non-blinking object that moved over me and then a downward movement before it got VERY bright and blinked out.  My guess would be a meteor..but I don't see those very often.  I also thought it might be worth noting in case anyone else reports seeing something.  The 2 object I had first noticed seemed to dim out after this event.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436

2 orange, floating objects.;2014-08-02 21:45:00;30 seconds;2 orange, floating objects I arrived home around  21:45 on Saturday, Aug. 2nd.  I drove car into garage, parked my car, went to the back to remove items.   As I rounded back of car I noticed an orange light glowing in the sky, heading towards my home.   I proceeded to my driveway area and watched briefly before I turned on my phone video.  I captured the floating object, which continued on a northerly direction.   I stopped video and continued to watch, and it floated for another 10-15 sec before it blinked on/off, then finally disappeared.  I began walking back to my garage, looked again in the same direction and saw another orange object floating in the sky.  I attempted to video tape it, but couldn't get it in my viewfinder.   It started a NW direction, but soon went north, then north east and did the same blinking, before it disappeared.  Both were at around a 30-40 degree angle from the horizon, with perhaps a 500' height above ground.;39.040887012987;-95.6930437229436
