In 1975 I was traveling with a friend in my car returning home from a day trip.  We were just coming to the west end of our town.  We both saw at the same time a green object with a sort of florescent light with a red light on the bottom. It zoomed across the sky going at least several thousand mile per hour.  It went across the eastern sky, about the altitude of a jet, at about 45 degrees in about 2 seconds.  It left a green florescent trail behind it that faded quickly but stretched pretty far.  I stopped immediately in the middle of the highway (two lane road really, HWY 56 in Kansas).  We got out and could see nothing.  Both of saw and described the exact same thing.
