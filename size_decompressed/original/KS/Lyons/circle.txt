Flashing lights darting across the Kansas night sky;2013-05-04 04:30:00;45 minutes;Flashing lights darting across the Kansas night sky I awoke at 3:30 a.m. and after lying awake for an hour I decided to look out my bedside window into the sky.  I almost immediatly noticed two round, almost starlike objects darting back and forth across the clear night sky.   They would  move in unison at times and other time independently but always ended up in formation.  They would flash white/blue/red lights that would change in both speed and brightness.   After watching for a bit I noticed a 3rd UFO that was much dimmer and less active then the original two.  I have no logical explanation for what I witness but it has made me a believer in the possibility of extra terrestrial life.;38.3371;-98.1866
