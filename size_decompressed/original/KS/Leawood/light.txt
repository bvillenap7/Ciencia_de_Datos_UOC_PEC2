Around 6:00 pm my 12 year old daughter and I were driving eastbound in moderate traffic on 135th St., between Roe Ave. and State Line Road in Leawood Kansas. She was sitting in the passenger seat up front and said look at that--its a spaceship circling the moon! There was still plenty of light out at this time of evening and the sky was perfectly clear. The moon was at 11:00 as we were driving. Of course I thought she was joking, even though she kept saying look, look, its a spaceship going around the moon. I still did not take her seriously, and then she said its over here now, between the telephone lines, and for a fraction of a second, I saw what she meant: a circular white light, that seemed to have a center and a halo, darting around.  I saw it only once it would flash then dispappear. After the only time I saw it, we did not see it appear again. She obviously saw it for a few more seconds than me. I don't know if there was more than one, but we did not see two round white lights simultaneously. I don't know if other drivers saw it or not the local newscasts did not mention anything about it.  I am a 40 year old mother of 2 who teaches art history at a community college my daughter is a bright 12 year old girl who plays the violin.;38.9694;-94.6266000000001
