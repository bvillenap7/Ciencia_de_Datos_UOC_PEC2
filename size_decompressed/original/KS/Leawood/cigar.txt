Silent Cigar Shaped UFO Leawood, KS.;2013-11-25 23:20:00;7 seconds;Silent Cigar Shaped UFO Leawood, KS. I was walking out to my mailbox and just took a look up at the stars and happened to see this long faint cigar or rectangle shaped (had little if no lights on it) just slowly gliding by with absolutely no sound.  It looked as if it had trusses, like 3-5 of them around the craft, that must've been supports of some kind.  I would have assumed this was one of those large chinook helicopters but there was no lights, and as I said before, no sound to it at all.   At the same time a plane was flying at cruising altitude with its lights on, and from that perspective I would guess this craft couldn't have been much more than 1000 ft up.  It was flying NE, and not very fast, but I completely lost sight of it after 5-7 seconds since it had no lights.  The coordinates for this event were lat 38.912, long -94.644, and again it occurred at 11:20 pm central time.;38.9694;-94.6266000000001
