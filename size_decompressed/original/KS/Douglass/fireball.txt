It was about 3:00 in the morning and as we looked off into the distance and saw something big and redish-orange with two red dots above it. We got curious and went to check it out, but as we started to walk towards it, it went below the horizon slowly, so obviously it was farther away than we originally thought. I would like to add, there were no drugs or alcohol involved.  We know we saw something, just not sure what it was. We did not get a picture of the object.;37.5175;-96.9977
