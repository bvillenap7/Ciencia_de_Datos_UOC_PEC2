Silent, unidentifed object moves in a southwestern direction from the North and changes shape/ lighting;2009-06-09 21:30:00;1 minute;silent, unidentifed object moves in a southwestern direction from the North and changes shape/ lighting I was leaving my In-laws house with my 5 month old son and wife when we noticed a south bound object approaching from the north. My first impression was that it was the white wing lights of a large plane, but it made no noise which was odd for how close the object was off the ground. It appeared to have no red or blue blinkers on it like a normal aircraft which seemed odd as well. We could not make out a silhouette of the object, just the lights. The craft proceed on a southern path before it did a light curve and headed in a southwestern direction. At this two smaller white lights appeared under one of the “wings lights” and then another set appeared under the other one. Now the two sets three appeared to slightly close the gap between themselves as they continued their path and what once looked two white wing lights of one object now looked to be two object with three lights, each in a triangular formation. The objects continued to travel side by side at airplane speed until they disappeared over the trees.;38.7909;-94.6650000000004
