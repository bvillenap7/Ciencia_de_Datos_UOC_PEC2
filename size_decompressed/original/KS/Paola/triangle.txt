3 traingle shaped objects, low to the gorund;2004-12-15 09:00:00;2 min;3 traingle shaped objects, low to the gorund I saw one traingle shaped object move at slow speed then speed up over paola kansas.  I could not make it out untill it got over the town and caught light reflection off the townn and i could see the shape. It apeared to be triangle but disc shaped on the bottom.  Soon after it sped off, only to be followed quickly by another. Then, about 30 seconds later, another.  About 10 min after that, a strange onrange boject moved across the sky, not very far before dissapearing.  Very odd, even for this area. Also no lights or sounds from  the objects. Also the next day, could be completely unaffilated, my car died 3 times in the area.;38.572;-94.8937
