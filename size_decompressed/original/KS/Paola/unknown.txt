Bright yellow object with unknown(possible changeing) shape.;2006-02-09 05:45:00;3-5 minutes;Bright yellow object with unknown(possible changeing) shape. While heading east on my way to work early in the morning I spotted what i thought was a bright yellow star, but it seemed to be close and began to move slowly from south of my car to directly in front (east) of me.  Before entring on-ramp I stopped and watched it for about 1 minute.  I could not make out the shape as it seemed almost to change from time to time, but it did move around a given area in the air.   After a few seconds it shot off in a northeastern direction and took about 5 seconds to vanished from sight.  Also their seemed to be smaller lights visible from time to time on the object that changed.  They also never blinked. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
