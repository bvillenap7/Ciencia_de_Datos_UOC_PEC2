UFO witnessed three miles north of St. Marys, Kansas.;1987-06-20 22:00:00;10 minutes;UFO witnessed three miles north of St. Marys, Kansas. My father and I went to the end of our driveway approximately 200 yards from our house to check our mailbox. It was a very dark but clear night. I remember being able to see the stars very clearly. My father was the first to point out the craft. It was approximately 500 feet hovering just to the northwest of where we were. It made no sound, but I remember seeing multicolored lights surrounding the outside of the craft. Everything was eerily calm. We just stood there and stared at the craft, almost frozen in place. I remember asking my father if we were both witnessing the same thing. He replied yes, but that we shouldn’t say anything to anyone because they would never believe us. After around ten minutes the craft lifted up to around 1000 feet and suddenly just vanished. Again no sound was ever emitted from the craft. For some context, we lived 3 miles northeast of St. Marys and approximately 5 miles away from Jeffrey’s Energy Center.;39.1974;-96.0613
