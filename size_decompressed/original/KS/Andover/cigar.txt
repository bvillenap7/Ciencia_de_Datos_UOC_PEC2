cigar shape, south central kansas 1992 or 1993;1992-07-01 15:00:00;3 min.;cigar shape, south central kansas 1992 or 1993 the date is an estimate. i know it was mid-afternoon in the summer when i was 10 or 11 years old. many of the details are hazy, but here's the basic story. some friends and i were in our neighborhood playing near one of those tree lines originally planted as a windbreak. we were all aged between 10 and 12 at the time. we were headed back to this tree line when one of my friends happened to look up and told us there was a funny looking 'thing' in the sky. turning north (tree line to the west), we looked and saw a cigar-shaped silvery-white object at about 45 degrees in the ENE. living near a few small airports and an air force base, we thought it was a plane, until someone mentioned there was no trail or exhaust. then we thought it was a large bird, but then realized that the 'wings' never flapped, and there was no possible way a bird could coast that long. there were few other characteristics we could see, as it was fairly high, and the sun only enhanced the bright silver color. it moved from ENE to WNW pretty quickly, and then disappeared b/c of a combination of sun and the tree line. as we were wondering what is was, another appeared in the exact same spot as the first and repeated the whole thing again. a third one did the same thing, and although we waited for more, we have never seen another since. we resumed our activities, thinking maybe it was a satellite or something, although we jokingly called it 'our UFO' for years afterwards. it wasn't until i was reading another posting on here describing a VERY similar experience that i realized that maybe we weren't so far off.
