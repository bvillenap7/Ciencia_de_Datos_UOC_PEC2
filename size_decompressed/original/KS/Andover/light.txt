Group of twinkling lights rapidly changing speed and advancing across the sky;2015-09-15 21:28:00;30 seconds;Group of twinkling lights rapidly changing speed and advancing across the sky At precisely 9:28 (and a few seconds) PM CST I saw a very strange series of lights in the sky. I was driving east on Central, just west of 159th E. when I saw what looked like a twinkling airplane, very large star or planet.  It was maybe 10-15 degrees above the horizon, and appeared to be moving pretty much straight south.  It was orange-ish, almost like a firework, but very long-lived and consistent.  There was only one visible initially, moving slowly, then it disappeared, and another immediately appeared quite a distance ahead of the first one, moving in the same direction at about the same speed, almost as if it had jumped ahead very rapidly.  This series of disappearing and reappearing happened maybe 8-10 times within about 20 seconds.;37.6968;-97.1163999999999
