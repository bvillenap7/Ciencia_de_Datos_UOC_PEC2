On the night of August 21, 2012, J.S.C was driving home from his fathers house.  Located in Smileyburg ks his girlfriend was in the car when the sighting occured.  It started as a large white light off in the distance as we drove closer to it it suddenly became darker with more lights around it. We immediatly knew it wasn't a plane it was far to low to the ground and not making a sound.  It would change directions and height on a whim.  At one point it appered.like a ball the next  as a real airplane came near it mimicked the flashing lights of it. When entering andover city limits the ufo flew right over the vehicle.  Since we had been watching it for miles the sun roof.was open for a better view.  While flying over the vehicle it appered as a triangle large and black with three lights on the tips and six in the center.  The lights on the tips were red, green, and yelow but kept changing points on the triangle. Upon entering Andover city limits it flew over some phone lines and was gone.;37.6968;-97.1163999999999
