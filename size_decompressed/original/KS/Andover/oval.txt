I couldn't miss since it was straight above the road.  It appeared suddenly for 3 seconds as if it came out of the cloud increasing in intensity.  It moved forward (east) a little and then went back up until it disappeared.  It's movement was very suddle and smooth.  At first I thought it might be a reflection but I moved my head around to orient the light better.  The light was the size of a medium size full moon except it was oval and it seemed to be rotating.   I don't believe in this stuff but now I'm not too sure.;37.6968;-97.1163999999999
