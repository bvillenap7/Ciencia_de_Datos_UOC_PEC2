UFO over Leavenworth, ks;2009-11-20 13:00:00;a minute;UFO over Leavenworth, ks I was driving along a country road where I could see the hole town. While driving I could see a big flash appear over the town and noticed that it came from a circular sphere like object that was changing colors and had a aura. The ufo went from a white ish color to a red/orange color and became brighter then disappeared or folded as I call it. This happened all under a minute.;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622
((HOAX??))

I was proceeding down a hill and noticed that on top of another hill was a strange very bright red light which kinda looked like the ufo from the night before.  The ufo had just been sitting on top of the hill or on the other side of the hill where I could see it threw the trees. I take this direction alot and know that hill.  I had never seen a red light like this before on top of this hill.  I began to drive around the other side of the hill to see what was going and by the time I got there the object flashed away.   I drove back to the other side just to make sure someone wasn't up on the hill and trying to mess with me. I believe this was the same ufo from the night before or same type.;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622
