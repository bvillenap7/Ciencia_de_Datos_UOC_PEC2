Late night UFO excitement in the county;2010-11-05 03:00:00;30 minutes;Late night UFO excitement in the county AT about 3:20 am I was leaving from a certain location witha high vantage point. Its very dark out where I was soo you can seeanything. I went to start my car and when doing so it didn't turn over atall I gave it a minute to get all the electricity running threw it and thentried it again and it worked. I thought nothing of it until all thishappened. As I then began to leave I started noticing what I thought was avery BRIGHT star. When slowing down my vehicle I noticed that it wasn't astar and it was deffinetly moving. I quickly did a U turn and as I did ithad either flashed or moved very quickly to the other side of a hill. Ibegan chasing this bright white object up to the next hill. The object beganspeeding up and moved accross the county heading west toward a radio tower.I ended up on top of the hill where it was. The object began to changecolors to a deep red and/or a orange(it went back and forth) and then headedback to where it was , where !I was at in ! my vehicle. The object stopped in mid air for several minutesdoing nothing and began heading back out west and a rapid pace. When lookingfor a reason why I noticed a airplane heading in its direction. It was amilitary aircraft not sure which kind to call it just know because of theuse of night lights. I left once I saw it heading in the same direction asmyself. Approximately 15 mins later when I was closer to where i needed tobe at that moment I did see a UAV overhead. Yeah you can see UAV's at night.Please note using the hill and the radio tower as a point of reference theufo was only 2 to 3 hundred feet off the ground the hole time;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622

Run of the Mill UFO;2010-11-06 03:00:00;1 minute;Run of the Mill UFO AT about 3:20 am I was leaving once again from a location with a high vantage point where I can see most of anything and it was very dark.  I was proceeding down a hill and noticed that on top of another hill was a strange very bright red light which kinda looked like the ufo from the night before.  The ufo had just been sitting on top of the hill or on the other side of the hill where I could see it threw the trees.  I take this direction alot and know that hill.  I had never seen a red light like this before or on top of this hill.  I began to drive around the other side of the hill to see what was going on and by the time I got there the object flashed away.  I drove back to the other side just to make sure someone wasn't up on the hill and trying to mess with me. I  believe this was the same ufo from the night before or same type.;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622
Two objects light up then slowly disappear as they travel across sky.;2013-06-03 23:00:00;2 minutes;Two objects light up then slowly disappear as they travel across sky. My wife and I witnessed two unknown objects light up or emit a very bright light for a split second, then the objects slowly disappeared.  They never stopped moving in the sky, but one abruptly changed its direction.  They were traveling from south to north.  The event lasted for about 2 minutes until the objects faded from view.  One appeared to be following the other.  There was no sound at all and there were no flashing lights.;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622
Flashing craft moving along set projectory(not plane or satellite) bluish white flashes, very bright, no noise, randomly appeared/left;2019-06-05 00:31:00;10 minutes;Flashing craft moving along set projectory(not plane or satellite) bluish white flashes, very bright, no noise, randomly appeared/left On back porch smoking a cigarette observing the stars.  Out of nowhere, behind me an immensely bright flash of whitish/blue light catches my attention.  At first thought it was a plane, a satellite, Helll I even tried to rationally think it was a lightning bug, but it was neither of those things.  UFO would flash extremely bright, then disappear then along the same path would randomly flash again and continued to do this on the same path for about 10 minutes until I lost sight of it behind the tree line.   I also at one point what saw a blueish hued tunnel of flashing light that happened when the ufo was about halfway across my view of the sky.  Last but not least two orange orbs came into my eye view before losing view of the originally seen craft.;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622

Bright light that got brighter, dimmed, and shot off;2019-09-05 21:16:00;2 minutes;Bright light that got brighter, dimmed, and shot off After seeing 4 ufo's a couple weeks ago, my fiance and I have been more diligent about looking at the sky.  After he came home from work, I went outside to greet him.  He looked at the sky toward the direction of the Missouri River and saw a bright star.  He joked and asked me if it was a ufo.  We laughed, but as we were watching the star, it got brighter and brighter.  After a minute, it quickly dimmed and started moving to the east.  After about 10 seconds, it shot upwards so quickly, it almost looked like it simply vanished. About 5 minutes after, our dog was let outside.  She turned to the direction we saw the craft and bristled and growled at the sky.;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622
