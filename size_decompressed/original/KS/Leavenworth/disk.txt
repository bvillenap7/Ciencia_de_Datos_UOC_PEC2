Large saucer flying over our street.;2019-08-23 23:00:00;2 minutes;Large saucer flying over our street My Fiance and I were outside, looking at the sky. We watched what we thought were the ISS and some satellites (were in fact UFO's and I reported that sighting as well).   After that sighting, we saw a HUGE craft in the east flying down above our street.  It had a large light on top and smaller, flashing lights on the bottom.   The craft moved without making a single sound.   After it disappeared behind the building in front of us, we saw a plane flying in about the same spot, which we used for comparison to determine that the craft was indeed not a plane.;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622
