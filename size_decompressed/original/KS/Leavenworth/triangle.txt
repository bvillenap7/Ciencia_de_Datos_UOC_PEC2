Dark, Silent triangular shape over Kansas;2002-11-30 19:45:00;1 minute;Dark, Silent triangular shape over Kansas I am a medical professional of 26 years.  I was outside on my deck at approximately 1945 hours the sky was spotlessly clear and the air was crisp approximately 25 degrees F.  I was looking up had just mused at the fact that I could only see about thirty degrees of night sky over head.  I have a canvas awning over a portion of the deck and it limited my line of sight to about 15-20 degrees either direction from 90 degrees straight up.  I would often look up at the stars and have on numerous occasions been able to see sattelites.  I noticed some motion against the motionless backdrop of stars and saw that what I had originally thought were stars were moving! There appeared to be three lights at the tips of a dark triangular shaped craft? moving slowly north.  The crfaft was able to precisely, fluidly change direction towards NE and then towards the NW.  The craft was low, approximately 1,000'-2,000' in altitude.  It moved SILENTLY, and it seemed able to change directions within its own radius (turn on a dime) but it was not moving fast.  It reminds me of the fluid, silent turn/roll of a sailplane.  For a moment I thought that's what it was, but I have never seen any sailplanes around here and I have lived here for 44 years.  I eventually lost sight of the craft against the backdrop of the stars. This was the strangest thing I have ever seen.  It happened tonight about 1.5 hrs ago.  I have been back outside straing my neck for a chance second peak.  But I know what I saw, and I DID SEE THEM.  I KNOW YOU ARE HERE.

One objects lights went off revealing a dark triangle. At dusk on August 25, 2020, 2 members of my household witnessed 2 large, round orange lights rising from the horizon south of our home.  The bright orange globes rose up slowly.  I thought they were floating Chinese lanterns and went outside on my porch to watch them drift. I have seen dozens of floating Chinese lanterns and I’m familiar with how they travel through the sky at night and their light effects.  As the 2 orange lights slowly climbed higher, they changed color instantly and then changed direction suddenly moving north. They changed color from bright orange to more yellow and white. As the objects got closer I realized they were much larger than a Chinese lantern and further away. The objects did not appear to travel in perfectly straight lines to each other and were silent. They were both going the same general direction of north toward Fort Leavenworth. As the first object got to my 10 o’clock, the lights suddenly went off and a dark, triangle shap! ed object was clearly visible. The triangle shaped object maintained the same path. The second bright, yellow-white light that was following the first moved past my 10 o’clock and kept traveling north with its lights on. It never turned it’s lights off. I have a video I took on my cell phone. The event was observed for almost 2 minutes.;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622
