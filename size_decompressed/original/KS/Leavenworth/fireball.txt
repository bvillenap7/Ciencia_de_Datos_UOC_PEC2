It was blue W/Blue ;1998-12-13 23:10:00;2-3 seconds;The ufo appeared as a falling star except that it was falling more straight down instead of arching across the sky. It was blue W/Blue tail.appearing to the west starting about 60 degrees above the horizon before it diapeared  befor hitting the horizion. Later in the night at 02:10 I witnessed another ufo falling  from the sky. this time it was white w/ white tail. It was approx. 15 degrees further to the north from the last sighting. As this fire ball was falling, it made an arch in it's trigectory. A slight bend in its line if travel as it neared the horizion line. It disapeared before hitting the horizion. Four minutes later at 02:14 Dec 14, 1998 I saw a third falling fireball. it was white W/ white tail. It was falling at about 280 degrees. it too disapeared before hitting the horizion line. It fell in a straight line. and also appeared in the night sky at about 60 degrees to the horizion. these fireball appeared to be falling as I have stated through out this report. Most falling stars that I have witnessed arched all across the sky. These appeared to be droping more than falling stars. (meteorite's) The night sky was partly cloudy. But stars could be seen clearly. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Sightings correspond to Geminid Meteor Shower of this date.));39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622

Slow moving fireballs going across sky in Leavenworth.;2013-11-09 21:20:00;5 minutes;Slow moving fireballs going across sky in Leavenworth. Two slow moving bright orange balls of what seemed to be fire going from northeast to northwest.  They were flying semi-low.  Fires appeared to die out as the got further, but you never know.   This was the second time that I've seen this in about 7 months.  Definitely not Chinese lanterns.   My husband, a neighbor, and I were the witnesses.;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622
