Several constant beams of light spread out across the sky;2009-12-14 22:43:00;15 min +;Several constant beams of light spread out across the sky Walked outside to see several constant beams of whitish lights shooting up into the sky.  The beams grew and fell off in intensity, all while maintaining their locations.  Some beams were grouped in fours, others in two's, and were spread out in front of me as in a line.  However the beams were not all on the same line but had some depth to them.  It was like they came from a promotional spot light but were too many in number and covered an area far too great to be spot lights.  Also the lights were to my north and north east with nothing really out that way but country and small towns if anything.  No clue what they could've been or seen anything like it before.;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622
