((HOAX??))  Just a run of the mill UFO;2010-11-05 06:00:00;15 seconds;Just a run of the mill UFO At about 6:00 I was heading out for the evening and was getting in my vehicle and looked up noticing a very bright tear shaped craft heading southeast at a very fast rate in speed.  The craft was just above the tree lines where I was.  After just a few seconds of seeing the craft and pointing it out to a friend the craft then took a 90 degree angle and headed north then quickly disappeared or faded away without changing colors like they normally do.;39.3045459330146;-94.9319990430622
