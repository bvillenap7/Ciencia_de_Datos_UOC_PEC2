cigar shaped object appeared low over lake in Great Bend after July 4th fireworks.;1971-07-04 22:00:00;15-20 minutes;cigar shaped object appeared low over lake in Great Bend after July 4th fireworks. My girlfriend and I walked to the fireworks for the 4th of July.  They were shot over the lake north/west of town (at that time)and by the time we got there the fireworks were over.  The fire department was still there making sure no fires would start up from falling ashes and we along with numerous kids to adults were about to leave when a cigar shaped object with shining multi colored lights underneath appeared over the lake.  It hovered for what seemed like 15 - 20 minutes very low over the small lake.  No one moved until all of a sudden (and I think it was an M-80) a loud explosion sent gravel flying around us and the object raised up a few feet and then swish it was gone.  A picture and article was in the paper the next day but I can not find any mention thru research.  I could have the year wrong + or- one year.  That was not my first episode!
