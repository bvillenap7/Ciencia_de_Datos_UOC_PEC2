jetliner object scanning property with broken beam - enormous and very low;1993-07-18 06:30:00;10-15 minutes;jetliner object scanning property with broken beam - enormous and very low My daughter and I were coming home from town and as we topped the hill [about 1 mile from our home] I stopped at what I saw.  Hovering over our land [6 acres] facing west was a enormous jetliner object with a brilliant beam about 8-10 feet across coming from directly center under the object but not a constant beam. It was solid under the plane for what looked like 200 feet and then blank sky for about 50 feet and then to the ground about 100 feet. The wings were near the back of the object.  It looked to be scanning our land.  It was enormous covering most of our property and very low.  All of a sudden I thought of our horse, goats, dogs and other animals and put the truck in gear and floored it.  But as soon as I did that the light dissappeared and the object raised slowly up until it was tiny and stopped.  As we drove into the yard and got out and looked up the object moved swiftly forward and then made a tight turn to the north and whoosh it was gone.  I called the sheriff's office and reported the incidence only to find out numerous sighting of smaller object were reported over Meade Lake (about 20 miles east of us)later that same night. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD));37.0461;-100.9309
