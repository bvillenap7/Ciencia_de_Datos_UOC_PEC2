PD);2011-05-05 21:00:00;2 minutes;An object that looked like a bright star, slowly descended straight toward the ground, slowly faded and then disappeared. On May 5, 2011, I was letting my dog out about 9:00 p.m..  I looked up in the south-eastern sky and noticed a bright light.  It looked like a star.  As my son and I watched it, it slowly descended straight down toward the ground, faded, and then disappeared.  I've never seen anything like it.  We live about 55 miles from Fort Riley Army Base.  Maybe they were responsible for it.  We didn't hear any noise during its descent. ((NUFORC Note:  Over-flight of the ISS occurred at 20:55 hrs.  PD));39.024;-97.6004
