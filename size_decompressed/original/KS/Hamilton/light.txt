Slow Moving Shape Changing Flash;2008-11-09 19:00:00;10 min;Slow Moving Shape Changing Flash   At 7:10 pm Nov 9th 2008 in Hamilton KS I was coming home from my parents house when I was walking to the back door I looked up at the sky and noticed what I thought was a new Radio and/or cell tower. After watching said Lights I came to realize it was very slowly moving with no noise The Object appeared to be three quarters to one mile away from where I was standing. It had a dominate orange light with occasional red glittery flashes but they were not in a rhythm as with a commercial aircraft. It had moved and tree branches were obstructing my view so I walked to the back yard and finally went to the road where there is an open field with one tree for a better look. as I was watching I noticed from in front left of the object there was a flash ,one flash that reflected off the sky some how. Then it seemed to spread into a boomerang shape and then back to a single object. I watched for about ten minutes as it slowly vanished. After seeing the flash I remembered when I pulled in the driveway seeing a flash I though might of been lightning and then noticed there were no clouds above town but dismissed until I saw it come from this object. It was moving south in almost what appeared to be a zigzag fashion. I felt My hair on my arms stand up. And kind of disorientated. for some reason.;37.9762;-96.1703
