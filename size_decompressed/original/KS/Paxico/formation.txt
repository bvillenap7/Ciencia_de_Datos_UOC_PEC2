It was about 19:30 when I saw a huge falling star (meteorite) that fell due west.  I was the only one who saw this.  We had just turned south out of my family’s driveway (a tractor pulling a trailer of 17 adults). It was around 20:30, there were 18 adults on a hayrack ride.  We were in a rural area, and I happened to see some flashing round red lights.  There were eight lights and they appeared to be “hooked” together by something because they were evenly spaced.  The lights would blink on and off at the same time.  They were traveling in a horizontal line and in a west/northwest direction.  All of us on the hayrack ride saw these lights.  We watched the lights for about 15-20 minutes before we could no longer see them. My nephew and his friends who were in a different town about 10 miles east of us, also saw these red flashing lights.  He described them exactly how we saw them.;39.0813;-96.1868
