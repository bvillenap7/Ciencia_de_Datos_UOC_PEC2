Horrifying greenish blue, color changing figures by the lake in Mongomery KS.;2013-04-04 13:00:00;~30 minutes;Horrifying greenish blue, color changing figures by the lake in Mongomery KS. I was outside near lake Tanko beside the Hish School area.  As I was approaching the gravel road I saw two odd, BRIGHT formations in the sky. They were green, blue, and turned to a bright sun light figure.  They soon become what looked similar to a plane and was black.  I know it was not a plane though. I have a friend named Hydee who was there to see the craziness.;37.2645;-95.5642
