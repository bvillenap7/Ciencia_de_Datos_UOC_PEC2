My wife and I were standing outside smoking a cigarette on our porch looking south and seen approximately twelve solid red lights that went from south all the way north in a matter of seconds it was too fast to even get a camera.  They started out in a circle and ended up changing into a V shape. By the time I got downstairs to go look on the other side of the building they were completely gone.   By far the weirdest thing I have seen.  If anyone has any suggestions what this may be please let me know. Thanks.;37.566;-97.3577
