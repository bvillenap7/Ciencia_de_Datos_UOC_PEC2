2 witness enormous craft;2011-09-28 21:05:00;7 minutes;2 witness enormous craft I was driving west on highway 4, 1 mile outside of Llindsborg. I pulled over because I needed to vomit. My car was facing south. I was leaning out of my car when out of the corner of my eye I saw 8 green lights hovering over a house to the south of me. I turned off the lights on my car to watch the lights to find out what they were.  It was a large flat craft that appeared to be almost half the size of the mile wide field.It starting moving very slowly towards the northwest. It looked to be 40 or fifty ft off the ground. I rolled down my windows to see if I could hear anything but it was silent. I watched the craft makes its way towards the highway.  It started to fly over the highway.  A car drove underneath it. I backed up onto the road and starting driving towards it.  It picked up speed and disappeared into the distance.  I went home and called the national ufo reporting hotline who referred me to this website.;38.5824;-97.6706
