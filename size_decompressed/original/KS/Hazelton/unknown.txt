The sky was very clear, no clouds. The object was a very bright white light. The size was approximately 4 times bigger than a regular star in the sky on this night.  It also seemed to have beams of white light coming off of it, and traveling in a southeast direction going about 40 to 50 mph. The object was silent, and moving in a straight line for about 2 minutes. Then the object shot straight up in to the sky at very high speed and then vanished.  As the bright light shot up into the sky, the light also faded and it vanished within about 2 seconds.;37.1008;-98.402
