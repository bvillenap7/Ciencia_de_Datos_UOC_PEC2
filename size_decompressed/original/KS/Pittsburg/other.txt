At approximately 19:25, my neighbor and I were outside chatting about the World Series. We began to discuss the fact that the local university is broadcasting the World Series on the Jumbotron at the football stadium on campus.  I glanced up at the sky in the general direction of the stadium, and saw a very large, seemingly partially materialized object low in the sky for the duration of approximately 5 seconds.  It made no noise as it moved in a southwesterly direction, with no visible light emitted from the object.  Wagering a guess of its size, I would say it was at least the size of a football field.  No reference to the aforementioned football field intended. The object was shaped like a W, but replace the two connected V's with two crescent shapes.  My neighbor saw it too, and said it looked like a flock of geese.  I have never seen geese fly in a formation other than a V shape.  However, I can also state my neighbor is not the smartest person on this planet, as he was calling a baseball inning an ending as we spoke tonight.  Perhaps it was a flock of geese, but I thought this worth reporting.;37.3933;-94.7161999999999
