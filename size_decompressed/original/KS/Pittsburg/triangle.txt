The trianlular object flew over my car;2000-12-18 21:00:00;15 sec.;The trianlular object flew over my car I was driving home a spotted what I thought was a reflection in my mirror, but when I looked back I thought it was headlights, but instead I saw a large (bigger than a car),black, triangular shaped thing in the sky. It was flying just above the powerlines. It had 2 white lights (like headlights) on the front of it and an orangeish-red light on each side (they were blinking.) It started out on the left of my car, then it flew over the top of my car(I honked my horn as it went over me) and I watched it fly away. I watched it until I couldn't see it anymore. It was headed in a NW direction. I was only a few blocks from home, thank goodness!! It is the type of thing that you're afraid to call the police about. They might think I was nuts!!;37.3933;-94.7161999999999
