There were large patches of clouds that were moving west to east They were being highlighted by the moon glow. I video and took digital pictures for about 10 to 13 minutes. I was using a sony handycam on a tripod. As soon as I finished taken the pictures. I came inside my home and reviewed the tape and pictures with the aid of my computer. The video has many interesting ufo objects. I have study this video many times over the past few weeks, and cannot come up with any logical answers. hopeing you all could help in finding the answer.

No sound heard, and the light either totally disappeared or went behind trees and out of my view.   I came inside to check tracking of the ISS which showed it already moving into Quebec.  I came inside to check the location of the ISS after only a minute or two or watching the moving white light.  Besides, the ISS online tracking showed its path over Nebraska, and not over SE Kansas on this specific orbit.   Could have been a satellite, but it looked too bright to be a satellite.  That's why I initially thought it was likely the ISS.;37.3933;-94.7161999999999
