White Fast Orb with Pulsing Red Glow.;2015-09-20 20:20:00;2 minutes;White Fast Orb with Pulsing Red Glow I was pedaling home going south on Broadway.  I had passed Walgreen's and yet was not to the University.  During this time I saw a white orb moving quickly from West to East. What caught my attention was the rhythmically appearing red ring that appeared every 2 seconds or so.  The red was an amazing light or ring, I can't describe it.  But the red rhythmically appearing pulse was something I'd never seen before.  It made me think of Venus' rings, I don't know why.  I wanted to use my iPhone to video it, but I was too amazed.  It disappeared out of my sight just because of the buildings that were too high to see it anymore.   I was hoping I wasn't the only one who saw it.  I was in the street among dozens of cars and I almost expected people to pull over to talk about it or video it, but maybe since they are car-people, they weren't able to see it as easily as me a bike-person. :) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.
