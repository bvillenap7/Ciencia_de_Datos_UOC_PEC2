I was 8 or 9 at the time. I had gotten up to get a drink and when I came back to bed I saw a yellow egg-shaped object out my west window. It was slowly descending at about a 75 degree angle.  It passed behind a row of tall trees which were about 50 yards from our house. I could still see it through the trees and it looked as if it would land behind the horizon about half a mile away. Before it landed, I got really scare and hid under my covers and didn't see anymore.. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.3495;-95.4637
