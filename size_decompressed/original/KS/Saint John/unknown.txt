Red lights in sky for 10 minutes.;2014-07-04 23:00:00;10 minutes;Red lights in sky for 10 min.   My husband and I went to our backyard to watch fireworks.  To the north of us there was someone setting off a lot of fireworks.  I saw these two red lights that I assumed were a plane.  They would flash green for a few seconds then back to red.  The only thing that made me think it was not a  plane was that it stood still.  I asked my husband if he saw it.   He assumed as well it was a plane because it started to move, but then stopped and hovered.   Once the object started moving the lights stopped flashing to green and stayed a constant red.  We stood there and watched it for 10 min just hovering in the sky.   I realize this could have been a helicopter, it moved and hovered like one, but the lights didn't flash.  They stayed a consistent red.  After ten min it moved to the east and out of site.;38.0017;-98.7613
