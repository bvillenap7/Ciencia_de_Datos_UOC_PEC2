They all came from a dark area of the sky.  I looked up and saw 2 what I thought were Satellite's moving West to East;2019-11-24 05:30:00;minutes;They all came from a dark area of the sky. But like they were coming out of something darker than the space around them. Like watching items come off a conveyor belt in a factory. It was almost mechanical in feel.  They all traveled from the southwest to the northeast. They went in a mostly single file pattern. One after another.  All looked similar to venus looks from earth(bright white lights)  They all continued northeast until fading out of view. Took about 20-30 seconds to cross the sky beginning to end.  Every few objects another would travel next to one like an escort. On northern side of line of objects.   I saw like a flare type white streak under them a time or two.  I could see sever small dimmer objects observing from what appeared further away. I would guess 3-4.  If I were to guess direction of objects travel I would guess Hudson Bay or Baffin Island from southeast Kansas.  I was so in awe I didn't think to try and capture with phone until afterwards. Used old picturesto give example.  I have seen a lot if odd thing's from the wilds of Idaho to Texas my entire life. I watch things by my nature. I never ever saw unknown objects so numerical or almost robotic in feel. Nothing that I felt compelled to share, ever.  There was air traffic and don't know how this wouldn't be seen from a large radius.   It was very clear and very open and easy to see. I am still rattled 14+ hours later;37.6045;-95.2475
