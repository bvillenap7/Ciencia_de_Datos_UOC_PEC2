((anonymous reports));2018-12-20 20:45:00;10 minutes;Saw a triangular aircraft hovering at night near the tonganoxie I-70 exit. Saw what I thought was a regular aircraft except it was hovering over the I-70 tonganoxie exit.  Has one or two white lights toward the front like a typical aircraft and wing marker lights that would blink like a normal aircraft except the aircraft was not moving it was hovering.  Triangular shape similar to stealth fighter aircraft F-117.  Looked fairly large.   Also, noticed one unmarked police Ford Explorer nearby before passing I-70 rest area after passing the aircraft.  Not sure if they had noticed it as well.;39.103;-95.105
