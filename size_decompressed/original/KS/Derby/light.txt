A moving star approaches from south, moves about erratically, then sits motionless.;2015-07-04 21:40:00;45 minutes;A moving star approaches from south, moves about erratically, then sits motionless. I was laying on a lawn blanket with my family awaiting the Derby city fireworks display around 9:40 PM, when I observed what I thought was a satellite approaching from the south.  My whole family observed it and we wondered if it was the ISS passing over.  My son quickly checked on his phone and saw that the ISS was over the ocean.   We continued to observe what we presumed to be a satellite until it slowed, abruptly changed direction to the east, paused, then moved around quite erratically before coming to a complete and motionless halt.  After a few minutes, it moved to the east, and then turned north and came almost directly overhead.  It slowly moved back to the southwest and “parked”.  It stayed there and appeared simply as a star until we left and went home.  My son and I were so intrigued, we watched it the whole time instead of the fireworks. I wondered at first if it could be a drone and what we were observing was positioned lower in altitude than we initially perceived, but its peculiar movement, silence, and perfectly motionless “parking “ for an extended period of time, make me think “no”.  It appeared to be high in the atmosphere, and looked just like a star.   My son and I were especially intrigued, and we were curious if anyone else saw it.

Numerous orb crafts of different colors seen over south central KS.;2016-10-22 19:30:00;2;Numerous orb crafts of different colors seen over south central KS. Just after dusk a witness spotted numerous orbs of light in the sky ranging in color (green, blue, red, white, white/red) and told the rest of the group to look up.  For approximately 2 mins there was an assortment of orbs that flew from south to north in no pattern.  They were to fast to be planes and to slow to be shooting stars.  There was no noise associated with these crafts.   We were in the backyard when this incident occurred.  The crafts were different colors and could be seen a long ways off and never disappeared until they were far away.  They seemed to all be at the same altitude and speed.  Their flight path was erratic in the fact that some were close to each other and others were weaving.  This was seen by the entire group.  Pictures were attempted to be taken but they pictures were not coming out in the dark.;37.5544;-97.2586000000001
