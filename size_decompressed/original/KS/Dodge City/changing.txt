PD));2017-06-11 04:00:00;45 minutes;At approx. 4:00-4:45 am, I witnessed a large, seemingly round, orange orb in the sky, floating above an area of about 5 square mi..  It was sitting low in the sky seeming to bob up and down.   As I watched I threw flashlight signals at it with a phone and it seemed to have came apart from itself into 2 objects, then back into itself.  Very bright and very close it moved in a direction toward me and then back.  I did not see it leave but just slowly continue to ascend.  Made video record of it and felt intimidated like I was being watched so I left the area I was in.  It moved in a very strange hovering way.  Guessing it was most likely the size of a large bus in oval to round shape.  As it was being recorded, it seemed to shimmer and go from orange color to white.
