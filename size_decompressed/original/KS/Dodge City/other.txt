It is shiny black, appears smooth, has no vapor trail, seemed to be ‘gliding’ but in a very steady & solid way. We are looking at them and then they disappear. They do not fly away, they simply disappear. They seemed to be following along behind and below the airplane. So that’s it.  One guy we told said maybe it was a military craft that they ‘clocked’ with mirrors. I have seen other things back home at night, watched one fly quickly to the left and stop, then quickly to the right and stop then same to below then stopped, then did it all again.  The lights on it made it look like a triangle shaped craft. This was back in 2002 over Olney, OK.  Watched and decided there was not a thing to be done about it because we were sure it was on radar somewhere. I admit we kind of got bored it lasted so long.  That one had 7 witnesses, 3 being adults.  One friend with an autistic child said that I was the only non-family member they would ever leave their child with.  I am educated and curious and would not be suprised to finally find that these are from other worlds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
