This is a continuation of a previous report.  During a cross country trip, I was driving about 20 miles east of Dodge City, KS, when my passenger noticed an object flying from NW to SE at high speed.  The orb like object was glowing a bright yellow gold with no other lights.  It was being chased by an aircraft (presumably military, but ?).  Estimated altitude 10,000 Ft. Estimated speed 700 - 800 MPH.  This object looked just like the one sighted at 2100 west of Pueblo, CO & reported on a separate report.;37.7533;-100.023
