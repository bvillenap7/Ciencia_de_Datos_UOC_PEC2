Two lights of unknown orgin seen 15 miles Southwest of Bonner Springs Kansas.;2005-10-14 18:55:00;5 minutes;Two lights of unknown orgin seen 15 miles Southwest of Bonner Springs Kansas. We were going to Price Chopper to pick my wife up, and saw what was 3 lights in a triangle fashion but very far apart from each other toward the Southwest.   I believe one of these lights to be an airplane, but the other two did not blink, and moved slowly toward the East Southeast.   Hard to say what they were, and I figured it could have been a number of things.   However these lights were not flood lights, or lights from a car sales company.    I would say they were about 15 miles Southwest of me.  The reason I know one of the lights was a plane is because it ended up flying over us, and as it came closer you could see, and hear the plane.;39.0667;-94.9197000000001
Bright light about 10 miles North of Bonner Springs Kansas.;2005-12-01 18:39:00;10 minutes;Bright light about 10 miles North of Bonner Springs Kansas. The bright light just set still for about a minute to my North, and then shot off to the North real fast.  Then the light just set still. I would guess the bright light was about 10 miles to my North when we first saw it.  My guess is, it shot rapidly to the North about another 10 miles when we noticed the helicopter. My wife pointed out the helicopter flying to the Southeast of the object.;39.0667;-94.9197000000001
