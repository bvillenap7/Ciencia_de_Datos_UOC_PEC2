I saw one luminous green ball that started just under the clouds and fell like a falling star but much much closer.  It faded out in about 3 to 5 seconds, on this side of the horizon. It was about 1/3 the size of a full moon, and about as bright.  It reminded me of a roman candle in reverse. I'm a small business owner and was up late doing bookwork in front of my french doors when I saw this.  We had cloud cover last night and we live in a rural area so it was very dark out side and I checked to see if it could be a reflection of any kind. No way.  I'm just curious about what it could have been. Are meteors this color?;39.0667;-94.9197000000001
