Hi Peter, know you want to keep track of whereabouts of activity on that great map of yours of our national sky.  first made a sighting, which you posted, at the ufo conference in Laughlin,nv. in late Feb.of this year.  My daughter said she stoped van, got out to watch 5 craft-1veicle in front of hers obviously watching them while driving.  When the1 craft broke formation & began moving toward tem, she wisely opted to get them te hell out of their, followed them a long way home. Regards, Lea.;37.8225;-94.7198
