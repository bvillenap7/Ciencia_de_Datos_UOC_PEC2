Star-like objects moving extraordinarily fast;2006-06-01 00:00:00;Aprox. 2-3 min;Star-like objects moving extraordinarily fast On a clear summer night in 2006, my girlfriend and I were laying on the sidewalk in front of her house on the southeastern outskirts of town looking at the stars.  As I looked straight up, I noticed what appeared to me to be a flight of military fighter jets flying in a triangular formation very high up.  As I noticed this, I told my girlfriend who had spotted the same thing.   Upon further observation, I thought the objects looked more like stars, as they were small and appeared to be white lights.  My girlfriend maintains that it was a single, solid object with lights on the leading edges.  Regardless of their shape they continued to fly straight at a constant speed in a westerly direction.  Soon the formation (or possibly one single craft) broke apart.  The objects on either side took off at extraordinary speed to the north and south respectively until they were completely invisible.  Soon the leading object did the same, flying straight ahead to the west.  These objects were moving extremely fast, and apparently at an extremely high altitude.  They literally took less than a second to disappear completely from sight.  Pleas note that the date and time of this sighting is NOT exact.  I was not aware of this resource at the time of the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));37.6478;-98.723
