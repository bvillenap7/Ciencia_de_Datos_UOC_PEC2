green floating obect;2004-06-27 03:15:00;10;green floating obect On 06/27/2004 at approximately 03:20 am 4 witnesses, 3 being Law Enforcement Officers, saw what looked like a neon green colored object floating in the sky.  It appeared to be hovering.  Three of us were talking and I observed it and brought it to the attention of the others.  The object stayed for approximately 5 more minutes and then slowly left north.  We were in such shock that we didn't think about taking digital photos.  There was only one object in the sky, it did not make any sounds or transmit any light but it just seemed to glow and take off after we all saw it.;37.6478;-98.723
