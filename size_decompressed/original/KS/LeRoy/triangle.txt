The lumbering giant;2005-09-10 21:00:00;5 min;The lumbering giant The size of the craft was extreemly large approx. four foot ball fields in width it  passed over our home .It made no sound it had red lights on the trailing edge of it three or four there was no sign of a power source it flew at approximately tree top hight and blocked out the stars . Flew from the west straight east .It I called to my family to observe it but it was to late. A family friend who lives four blocks away also saw it . We disscused our sighting and assumed it was millitary I thought it was quite strange as there are no major air strips or millitary bases nearby I expressed to her that I thought that it was dangerous for the plane to fly so low over town as she is a city council member I assumed that she would contact some one about it . To this day I have not disscused this sighting with her or any one else. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.09;-95.6232
