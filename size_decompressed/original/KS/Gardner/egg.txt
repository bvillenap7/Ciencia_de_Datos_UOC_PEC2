I was driving to work heading North bound on I-35 around 23:00 hours.  I was between Gardner and Olathe Kansas.  Suddenly a orange fireball descended from the sky.  I didn't realy think anything of it until this orange egg shaped  glow suddenly slowed down and turned green.  At that point I stared at it for a good 5 seconds and then it shot off towrds the east. I had a buddy who saw it driving in from another Highway.  He said it looked liked a meteor.  But he was to far away or I was to close to see it slow down in speed and turn green. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual, and he seemed to us to be a very credible witness.  Please see other reports for this date and time.));38.8074999999999;-94.9156999999998
