My mother and I were driving southwest on I-35, passing near Gardner, KS, well before dawn.  I noticed what looked similar to a satellite moving from the left part of the sky ahead of us toward the right, which I later determined on a map to be roughly SSE to NNW direction.  What caught my attention was that it was a greenish color - not white like a satellite.  It wasn't a bright emerald green but rather a dullish green light.  We intersected its path and it was out of my sight at that point, but and my mother was able to look up of the passenger side window as it continued north and observe it from underneath.  She saw several dimmer reddish lights apparently outlining a cylinder shape, with the brighter green light first observed at the rear.  None of the lights were flashing.  It was impossible for us to discern the height or size of the lights/craft as it continue on a straight course and out of sight.;38.8074999999999;-94.9156999999998
