I was outside looking for any remaining meteors possibly falling from the meteor shower that we are supposed to have and saw a Triangle shaped formation that was blinking a red/white/green color rapidly and then the shape started to shake.   I observed that for about 15 minutes until I called a friend to come up to my house which lives down the street and look at the object to make sure that what I saw was truly there.   He saw the same thing and when my neighbors came home from the religious services I asked them to look at the object in the sky as well and since one is color blind he didn't see the colors but saw the object and it shaking.   The other person saw what i saw and the other observer saw as well.  We have 3 confirmed people that saw the colors and 4 confirmed people that saw the shape as well as the shape that was shaking.   We then proceeded to check the rest of the sky and saw two other shapes that exhibited the same characteristics as the first possible craft that we saw.   We have watched this for about an hour now and it ended about 23:15.;38.8074999999999;-94.9156999999998
