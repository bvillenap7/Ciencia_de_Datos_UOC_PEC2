Cone/pie-slice shaped craft with 4 bright white lights flying low over the town.;2013-06-21 21:45:00;2 minutes;a cone/pie-slice shaped craft with 4 bright white lights flying low over the town. We were at the intersection of Center and Main street in Gardner, heading east.  We looked up and noticed a craft heading straight towards us, it was pretty low over the town and had two bright white lights with two smaller ones on the outer edges.  It was cone or pie-slice shaped on its side with the rounded part facing us and the pointed part facing away from us.  We could see the shape because it was like a dark shadow outline of the craft.   After it got fairly close to us, it stopped and began to move sideways towards the south.  It continued moving south and then disappeared.  On my way back home, people at the Gas station on Waverly st and 175th were reporting seeing lights over the municipal airport.   They said all of the cars headlights went out simultaneously at the gas station, and as soon as the lights disappeared, the headlights came back on.  I don't know if it is related, but three nights ago around 1am, I was driving to pick up my boyfriend from work and saw a tall, skinny, greyish-brown creature crossing the road.  It had to be 8-9ft tall and only took two steps to get across two lanes and it disappeared into the darkness on the other side of the road.   This also took place near Waverly st and 175th by the municipal airport.;38.8074999999999;-94.9156999999998
