Lights moved to verious locations instantle. From my position looking north/east at 20:40 hours on Oct. 27, 2016 I spotted 4 lights in a square with one blinking red light in the center.  Lights moved in a north/west direction.  At an approx. 60 degrees from first sight lights reversed direction little stopped and began to flicker.  Lights began to blink out and appear to reanimate in another place.  Lights did this about 10 times.  And moved in a north direction until out of sight.;38.8074999999999;-94.9156999999998
