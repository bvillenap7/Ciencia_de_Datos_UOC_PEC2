10+ twinkling lights move over countryside in circular formation.;2014-09-18 22:00:00;5 minutes;10+ twinkling lights move over countryside in circular formation This evening, my daughter and I were out on the patio, when all the sudden we noticed 10+ little twinkling lights moving in a circular formation across the sky.   I have grown up around airplanes and these were NOT planes, the lights were all moving independently of each other.   They did produce a sound that I would say is similar to a jet but duller and delayed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
