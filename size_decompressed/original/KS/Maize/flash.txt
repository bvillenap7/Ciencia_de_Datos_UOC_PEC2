Object reflects green light to the ground;2002-06-08 22:30:00;7-10 sec;Object reflects green light to the ground While sitting on the patio at about 1030pm I observed a green light on the ground. I was facing due south and the light was approching from the SE to NW. As it came closer, within 100 feet, I looked up and saw a green object not very high up in the sky. The light was intense and green. The object passed overhead and while still in sight turned bright red for an instant and then appeared to break up. There were distinct pieces visable. I watch a lot of night sky and have never seen anything come from this direction. The close proximity to the ground really gave an erie feel to the whole thing. It was probably a shooting star, but the direction of travel has me curious.;37.7758;-97.4737
