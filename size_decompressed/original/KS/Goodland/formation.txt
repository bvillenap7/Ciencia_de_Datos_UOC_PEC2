We were on INTERSTATE 70 at EXIT 17 and we saw red, yellow, and blue dots in the sky. It was clear and good weather that night. This was on July 5, 2005 on a Tuesday night and we saw these dots hanging in the night sky. It wasn't a plane or a weather ballon it looked like ufo lights. They hovered over the INTERSTATE on INTERSTATE 70 at EXIT 17 for awhile and we observed then then they all of a sudden disappeard and we didn't see them no more. This was about at 8:55 at night.
