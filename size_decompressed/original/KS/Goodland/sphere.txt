Green orb that seemed to fall in slow motion.;2010-09-06 21:46:00;10 sec;Green orb that seemed to fall in slow motion. Driving home with my husband from the store, crossing train tracks on cherry st. I saw a green orb about the size of a volley ball appear mid sky for about 5 seconds.  It seemed to fall North in slow motion in a diaginal angle for about another 5 seconds and then diappeared.  My husband works for the FAA, but did not see it due to driving and it was to his left.  Eyes were on the road.;39.3499;-101.7142
