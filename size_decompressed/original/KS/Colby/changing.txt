Object changed shape and color.;2007-01-19 11:07:00;30-45 seconds;Object changed shape and color. I saw the object while in my car sitting at a stop sign. It caught my eye because it was a golden-shaped orb. Two or three seconds later, it became a diamond shape. About 10 seconds later, it changed again, this time to a shiny, white cigar shape. I watched it for about 20-30 more seconds before it disappeared. I was looking north-northeast when I first saw it, and said object was moving west to east. The weather conditions that day were cold and mostly clear. No atmospheric interference, with the exception of some very high, small, spotty clouds, but the object was well below the cloud ceiling. My background â€” I have been a photographer and journalist for 10 years, and am a trained observer. I can say I what I saw was not an airplane, or any other conventional craft.;39.3801;-101.0434
