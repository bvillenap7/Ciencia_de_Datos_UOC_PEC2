Cylindrical object at night;2012-07-12 22:36:00;8 minutes;Cylindrical object at night I was heading north on Highway 25 when I saw two airplanes flying very close together, and noticed a third craft in front of them, much larger, cylindrical in shape, with a bright white orb on the front and a smaller red orb on the other end.  The three craft were moving from north to south.  They were closer than the next town over, which is about nine miles. The flight path was about 45 degrees above the horizon, and the cylindrical object was about half the size of the full moon.  It looked liked it was being herded by the two craft following it, which looked to be military craft, with one flanking it on the left and another following behind.  It traveled in a straight line from north to south.  However, as it went further south, it started to jog to the south-southwest, and also changed shape to a whitish-red orb. The entire sighting lasted 8 minutes, from 2236 to 2244.   As soon as I saw the object I turned around, and pulled off onto a side street, stopped the car and watched.;39.3801;-101.0434
