Strange yellow light/sphere appears, changes direction in sky, emits smaller sphere, and then fades to black (Jets scrambled);2010-09-03 22:10:00;>1 Minute;Strange yellow light/sphere appears, changes direction in sky, emits smaller sphere, and then fades to black (Jets scrambled) I saw this UFO tonight at 10:10 PM CST, where a large yellow orb/sphere came into field of view from behind trees.  I turned to my friend, outside with me at the time and said, what the f#%k is THAT?! He turned around to see this thing make an arching direction change, flare up, shoot another smaller orb off of it and up into the sky (like a pulse or something further unexplainable).  Than we watched this thing fade/dim out of vision, like someone turned on a cloak or simply dimmed the light. Object started at ~245-250 degrees (West by South West), and then corrected to a trajectory of ~170-180 degrees (South by South East). and was approximately 40-45 degrees in elevation from my vantage point.  Several minutes later a couple of military aircraft were observed scouring the sky in that area.Military pursuit a logical assumption due to the light patterns on the craft, (I used to work at the local air port am and familiar with airline and small aircraft light patterns)  Using the known size and distances of the aircraft in pursuit, I have extrapolated as best I can the approximate location of the UFO.  I'm not a quack.  I used to work at an airport and have flown quite a bit in small aircraft, am fluent in reading 5cm RADAR data. I was totally sober, with a friend and witness, one that I've seen this weird stuff with before (5 years ago).  That report is from 5 years ago is filed with NUFORC and can be viewed here: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/047/S47742.html  This craft was below normal operational flight for aircraft, or was flying high and was very large! Total time spend observing UFO: 16 seconds.  Time spent watching scrambled jets look for this thing, 20 minutes.  I have prepared all information onto a GOOGLE map to give you the best approximation of what I saw, when and where, along with the local airport data for visibility (10 miles, a very clear night).

White sphere being followed.;2011-10-21 22:47:00;30 minutes;White sphere being followed. Sighting was Friday, Oct. 21, 2011, starting at 9:47 p.m. Stepped outside on porch, facing east, to see how cold it was before going out for the evening. I looked up, and saw a whitish-cream orb followed by what appeared to be four military aircraft.  The craft were moving from my right to left, south to north, approximately 60 degrees from the horizon, not completely overhead. The craft following the orb looked to be military fighters, and one of the broke off, and was joined by three others. The three craft following the orb had to catch up when it turned right, and started heading east. The craft stayed on it, and we watched until they were out of sight. After the orb and the three planes following it were out of sight, other airplanes appeared, flying in a grid pattern. Lost sight of the orb at 10:07 p.m., and the other craft were in the area another 15-20 minutes.;39.3801;-101.0434
