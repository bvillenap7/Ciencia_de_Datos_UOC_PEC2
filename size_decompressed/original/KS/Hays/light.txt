I observed two constant lights in the sky.   ((NUFORC Note:  ISS in formation with Space Shuttle??  PD));2007-08-19 21:30:00;2 minutes;My husband was outside around 9:30.  I went outside to see what he was doing.  He told me to “come look at this.”  As I went out in the yard and looked up, I observed two constant lights in the sky.  My husband estimated that the lights were 25,000 feet in the air.  We heard no noise, but the lights were constant.  We thought if they were jets, they would have flashing lights.  The other odd thing about these lights were that they were in equal distance from each other the entire time.  At no time did the lights vary in distance.  The lights remained the exact same distance from each other.  After approximately 2 minutes, the lights faded out into the sky.  The lights were moving from the northwest to the southeast.  Another odd occurrence was prior to me going outside, I heard a loud “pop” noise in our bedroom.  I was in the master bathroom, which is right next to the bedroom.  That is why I went looking for my husband.  As I walked into the living room, our brand new HDTV went off, automatically. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS in formation with Space Shuttle??
