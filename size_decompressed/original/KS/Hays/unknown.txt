Fast moving, shapeless, opaque object w 3-4 dim lights.;2017-01-23 19:00:00;2 seconds;Fast moving, shapeless, opaque object w 3-4 dim lights. While walking the dog around 7 pm, looked up to see an object move from south to north. I watched it for 2-3 seconds. It had no color â€“ it was black or even opaque, and had 3-4 very dim, shimmering lights.  It almost seemed as if those lights were reflections of city lights, and not from the object itself, but rather reflecting off a dark or opaque surface.  The shape was indeterminate. Given the speed and size, I would have guessed it was a small consumer drone, flying a couple hundred feet off the ground, maybe 100 feet from me.  But it was completely silent.   It also moved with the speed of a small jet, but again, completely silent.  It was out of my sight in 2 seconds, flying to the north.;38.8789;-99.3392000000001
