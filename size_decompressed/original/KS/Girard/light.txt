Big orange light glowing in the woods at night witnessed by my mother and I.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2017-08-27 22:00:00;10 minutes;Big orange light glowing in the woods at night witnessed by my mother and I. I went out to put my dog into his outside pen, and I happened to look into the backwoods that are about 200 feet behind my house.  Up in the trees was a very visible orange and red light. It had rays as if it were a miniature sun.  It looked as almost if it was hiding behind a couple trees peeking at me.   I stood there not knowing what to think, it couldn't of been the sun reflecting off of the moon, because it was in the woods.  It couldn't be a light reflection because there was nothing to shine off of high in the woods.  It most definitely couldn't be anyone holding a light because first, no one lives back there, and second, it was high in the trees.  Our trees in Crawford county are around 30-50ft tall.   After standing there for about 2-3 minutes I quickly ran inside to tell my mom and we both went back outside.  The light was still there, but either it was going away from us or it was dimming out.;37.5103;-94.8599
