Triangular craft descends into the water;1989-07-03 23:00:00;30 seconds;Triangular craft descends into the water I was traveling southbound on US81 just north of the intersection for CR-D and saw three very bright red lights falling from the sky and slammed on my brakes. The lights were headed directly at my vehicle at a rapid speed. The craft began to slow rapidly and hover. The craft rolled over to a different side and had a bright yellow light. The craft turned again and I was looking directly at the engines no more than 1000 feet away. The engine I guess ran the length of that side of the craft and was a bright green in color and had a pattern of reverse triangle cells. The craft lowered itself down into the water and disappeared. I jumped into my truck and drove south to the weigh station in Belleville , Kansas and reported that I saw something go into the water to the scale master. He made a few calls and said that there were no reports of missing airplanes. I was a truck driver at the time and logged close to 2 million miles accident free.;39.8236;-97.6213
