Fast, Silent, Low Flying, traveling over the center of town!!;2008-11-01 00:10:00;<10sec;Fast, Silent, Low Flying, traveling over the center of town!! I was in my backyard looking at the sky when an object moving at incredible speed caught my eye.  It was traveling north as fast as a shooting star. The speed is the only thing that the object shared in common with a shooting star. What I saw was a dark object in the shape of a cigar but more like a long egg.  There was no light on the craft it was only noticeable due to the light in the atmosphere caused by the city lights.  It traveled silently in a straight line toward the north this was noticeably in a direct northern path. When I caught sight it appeared to be between 300 and 500 feet in the air, it was only about 2 blocks to the west of my position. I was facing the west. There was no sound. What I think was most amazing is it had no lights whatsoever. I am a avid night sky watcher and have observed countless shooting stars, and all types of night flying creatures. This was the first UFO that I have witnessed that I could not contribute to an explainable cause.;38.8287945054945;-97.631779120879
