All of a sudden, the smaller oject quickly moves away from the larger one, and stops.  They change color from green to red to a yellowish color, sometimes seeming to explode, then reform their shape.  They do not move with the the stars or planets. I have observed these objects for a few months.  Sometimes they just disappear completely, then reappear.;38.8287945054945;-97.631779120879
