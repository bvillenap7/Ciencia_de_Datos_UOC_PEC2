I was driving west on I-70 going to Salina, and it was a beautiful clear day. I noticed that high up in the sky, above the highway, was a round shiny metallic object just hovering there. The body of it reflected the sunlight. I watched it on and off for a good 10 seconds (managing not to get into a wreck), and then all of a sudden it disappeared.  I am a college student majoring in music.;38.8287945054945;-97.631779120879
