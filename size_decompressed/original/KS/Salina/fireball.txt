Salina Kansas Meteor ?;2001-08-02 22:10:00;10 seconds;Salina Kansas Meteor ? A bright ball of light like a Roman Candle came from the northeast of the City of Salina, KS,  from approximately 10 degrees in height and bearing and flew on a nearly horizontal path to the southwest of the city.  I lost sight of it over the tree line.  If it impacted the earth I would place it somewhere in the area of the Smokey Hill Bombing Range or near Lindsborg or Marquette Kansas.  The object was about one third the size of a street light as viewed from a block away and a little more intense in brightness.  The color was white/yellowish with a very small trail of sparks at times.   There were several aircraft in holding patterns over the city at the time and it didn't look like it was much higher in altitude than they were.;38.8287945054945;-97.631779120879
