Long orange light in the sky traveling north;2021-06-30 22:50:00;5 minutes;Long orange light in the sky traveling north Went outside for a smoke. Noticed an orange light lower on the horizon to the south . At first, I could not see movement. As I watched for the next couple of minutes, I could see it rising higher as it was coming straight towards me. It's partly cloudy tonight, so I could see it disappear behind a cloud then come out. It stayed one steady speed and soon it was directly overhead. It was long, narrow, almost like a rocket (tube) on it's side and had no flashing lights. The whole object was lit with an orange glow. Once it passed overhead, it went behind a cloud, appeared and disappeared a couple times in the breaks in the clouds, then disappeared for good behind clouds. I checked where the space station was located which was nowhere near my location, but it was larger than that. It was not an airplane. I heard no noise either.;38.8287945054945;-97.631779120879
