Bright solid light moving rapidly east;2005-10-04 06:50:00;approx. 2 minutes;Bright solid light moving rapidly east It was around 6.50 in the morning and I am in my car taking a break from my graveyard shift, talking on the phone with my fiancé when I all of the sudden I see something resembling a star right above my head moving rapidly east. The manner of how this light was behaving and how it looked, said to me that this could not be an airplane.  I told my fiancé which was home at our house 2 minutes away to go outside and take a look, but the object was moving away too quickly for her to locate it on the sky, and also with our house being surrounded by huge trees making it difficult to spot. It was dawn but still the sky was deep blue and stars could still be seen clearly for about 10 to 15 minutes after the object had moved out of my sight to the east.  It did not change shape or color, but simply moved very fast over the sky in a straight line till it was gone.  The whole thing took about 2 minutes from me noticing it, till it was gone. Don't know what this was, but no plane I know of look or act in the way this star did.;37.6747;-95.4552000000001
((HOAX??))  I observed a possible multiple U.F.O. sighting.;2008-07-15 22:00:00;40 minutes;I have been fascinated with U.F.O.'s and Extraterrestrial Life as a child. And have observed 2 to 3 possible U.F.O.'s   Tonight (July 15, 2008) my father and I observed a possible multiple U.F.O. sighting. Mostly in the southern sky. The first one we experienced, we had believed it to be a Sattelite in orbit, yet we observed about 7 others. Some moving in some tipe of circular formation.   I'm very serious about this and hope to hear something. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));37.6747;-95.4552000000001
