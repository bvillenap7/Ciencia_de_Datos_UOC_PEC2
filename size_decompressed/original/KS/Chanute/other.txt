the object did not emit other object[error];2006-02-23 00:45:00;several minutes;the object did not emit other object[error] A very large brilliant white strobing star looking just like mars or venus except much larger in western sky above my hotel window that just sat there without moving for seveal minutes. Moved my gaze to the left to see one or the other of the  planets and then moved my gaze back to the object that then dimmed and moved backward in the sky, shot out a light that lit up around it. This then happened two more times [3 times in secession] then just disappeared.The degree of brightness in the shot out light was the same intensity of the dimness it had dimmed to. The distance covered backward in the sky, each time was the same in each manuver. The tolal time it took to do the three backward shifts was four seconds. The length of the sighting is estimated at about ten minutes or perhaps even less.;37.6747;-95.4552000000001
