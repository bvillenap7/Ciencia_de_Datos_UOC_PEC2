Red/Yellow fireball low on the Southern Horizon of small Kansas Town;2010-07-03 16:00:00;5 min;Red/Yellow fireball low on the Southern Horizon of small Kansas Town I was traveling east on Main Street when I looked to the South and saw a red to yellow fireball that was stationary in the sky.   It appeared quite low to the ground with a yellow center and a red flame type appearance surrounding it.   As I was in town, I first saw it in a block where there were no buildings and then twice more when looking down the alleys as I drove by.   I was then in a turn lane and forced to turn north, away from the object.   It was a clear day with little to no clouds.  The time in this report is approximate.   I went back to try to locate it again.  However, the way the town is set up, I had to go quite a way around to return to where I saw the object and it was gone when I returned.   I had planned on attempting to get a photo of the object but was unable to do so as I could no longer catch sight of it.;37.6747;-95.4552000000001
