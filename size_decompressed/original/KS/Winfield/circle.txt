South-Central Kansas D shaped white light.;2018-11-22 05:00:00;45 minutes;South-Central Kansas D shaped white light Driving from Mulvane to Winfield and we seen this bright light while on the highway.  As we drove we realized this object was not moving AT ALL and it was much too bright to be a star or planet.  We also noticed that this object appeared to be in our atmosphere and was blinking periodically.  The object was mostly circular other than one edge which appeared to be flat like a capital D.  It was VERY white like an LED light bulb and periodically had red and blue flashes.;37.2386;-96.9731
