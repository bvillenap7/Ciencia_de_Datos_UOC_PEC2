Globe like the moon, but in the wrong place and at the wrong time of the month.;2001-04-22 20:40:00;2 minutes;Globe like the moon, but in the wrong place and at the wrong time of the month. I was driving east on Parallel Parkway just east of I-435 with a friend.  We were returning home from dinner in Bonner Springs.  It was raining antd I was looking out my window as we were driving.  I noticed a bright section of the sky to the north about 20 or 30 degrees (aprox) above horizon, towards KCI airport.  As I drove, I kept looking at the bright area thinking that it looked just like it would if the moon was behind the clouds. Then, just for a few seconds, I saw the moon peek out from behind/through the clouds.  It looked like a quarter at arms length, white with a dark spot about an eigth of its total size about two thirds up from the bottom and a bit left of center.  I had to look back to the road and when I looked again it was gone.  The glow of the clouds had also dissapeared. My friend did not see it but I asked him if the moon should be where I saw it and he said no.  Also, the next day I found out it was a New Moon, so that was probably not what it was.  I do not know what it was. I have been hearing of some sightings in this area at this time of the month, but this is the first I have seen of anything unusual.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
saw a growing burst of brilliant white light that slowly dimmed out of existance  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Iridium satellite.  PD));2005-04-08 21:30:00;2 seconds;saw a growing burst of brilliant white light that slowly dimmed out of existance At approximately 21:30 Friday April 8th, 2005, as my wife, Joy and I sat in our hot tub we both saw in the East/South East sky a brilliant white 'star'. But there is more to this event than just seeing. I was hoping to see Jupiter, which I heard was going to be visible in the southeast sky this week. When I saw this star (and I am just using the word 'star'for reference)I said to my wife, There's Jupiter. The moment I said this the 'star suddenly grew in size and brilliance-just as if something turned a light on using a dimmer switch very quickly to its brightest and then slowly dimming it until it completely dissappeared. The size difference-though hard to describe with such a distance-was like first seeing the point of a sharp pencil which then expands to the size of an unsharpened pencil and back to nothing. Both my wife and I asked each other at the same moment Did you see that? Object was seen head on and did not move in any direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Iridium satellite.

small white circular white object like a  period on apiece of paper but white in the sky.;2007-10-23 17:00:00;5 minutes;small white circular white object like a  period on apiece of paper but white in the sky. My daughter and I were looking in the sky at what appeared to be two jets that were circling a bright white circular light in the sky. The jets were pretty high up and after the object disappeared then the jets did as well. I have seen some pictures on the internet that resemble what we saw. In those pictures it looks likes a light hight in the sky similar to a very small sun.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068

I'm a researcher in the field,  worked for ((personal and employment history deleted)) crystal skull researcher.  I was driving on highway  I-35 Friday night and saw two orb shaped balls of fire hovering and moving in unison slowly to the south of the highway.   They seemed to be observing a traffic jam from road construction.   It was very brief and gave off no vibe/feeling which seemed to indicate they may have been ours or drones.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
