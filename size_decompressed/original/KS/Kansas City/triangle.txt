Triangle UFO hovering over Kansas City;2002-09-15 21:00:00;15 minutes;Triangle UFO hovering over Kansas City let's see. i was coming into KC from the west via I-70. eventually i noticed this thing on the horizon that looked like a plane, but it wasn't seeming to move. two lights, not very far apart. i watched it for about five minutes as i drove towards KC and it hardly ever moved much, but when it did it was a quick slide and then it would stop again. eventually i lost sight of it. but about 5 or 10 minutes later when i got to the suburbs where it was flat again, i saw it. hovering over the industrial area, off to my right. it was at about the height of the top of a radio tower, but there was no tower supporting it. it looked like a plane, kind of, but it wasn't moving. i could vaguely make out the triangular shape of it, and at each end of the triangle there was a yellow-white light facing down toward the ground. it didn't seem to move as i drove right under and past it, and then i couldn't see it anymore. on the way back out of town it wasn't there. as a follow-up, i looked for UFO information when i got home and was amazed when i came across a photo of a UFO from Belgium in i think 1990.  it looked exactly the same.  i surely hope someone else saw it.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
Bright white triangular shaped object with multiple colors trailing behind it viewed while driving on I435 Kansas City, KS;2006-04-06 21:00:00;5 seconds;Bright white triangular shaped object with multiple colors trailing behind it viewed while driving on I435 Kansas City, KS I saw a triagular shaped object mostly bright white with oranges, purples and blues trailing behind it.  I moved across the sky at an incredible speed for about 5 seconds then disappeared.  I was driving my vehicle at the time with my father-in-law in the passenger seat. He saw exactly what I saw.  We were traveling southbound on I 435 in the Kansas City, KS area.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
A large, triangular object with two banks of very large, bright white lights on the front two sides, hovering motionless near I-435.;2007-02-14 00:45:00;5 minutes;A large, triangular object with two banks of very large, bright white lights on the front two sides, hovering motionless near I-435. Driving home from the Kansas City International Airport at approximately 00:45 Wednesday morning, February 14, I saw a large, bright object hovering over a field area near the northbound lane of I-435. I was headed southbound on I-435, about 2 miles south of I-29, and at first I assumed this was a landing plane. It was much brighter than a plane, however, and it was pointed due north rather than east/northeast, which is the direction of the airport from this freeway. As I drove nearer, I realized that the object was not moving. I slowed down to about 45 mph to get as close a look as possible from my driver’s side window. The object was triangular in shape, with banks of very large, bright white lights across the front two sides. There were two other colored lights, I believe red and blue, which were smaller and near the points. The triangular shape was very well defined from the bottom, and in the dark in looked to be a grayish/metallic color. I continued to watch as I drove by, and the object remained in place. 	I was so alarmed and curious that I considered calling the police, but I didn’t know the name of the county I was in and dropped that idea. I also considered pulling over and getting a better look, but it was an extremely cold night and I didn’t feel safe stopping on the side of the freeway. I did call my husband to describe the experience to him. 	I am an extensively published nonfiction writer and adjunct lecturer in English at a university in Kansas.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
2 triangle shaped UFOS spotted.;2018-07-21 22:00:00;3 minutes;2 triangle shaped UFOS spotted in kck I was returning home off and while walking to my house noticed 3 red lights, upon closer inspection I noticed they appeared to be in the corners of a dark triangle object with a white light in the center, the object was moving fairly slow and very low, but was traveling the opposite direction of the airport.  I went and grabbed my dad but by the time he came outside you couldn't make out anything besides red lights in the distance.  As I was explaining what I had saw, a second aircraft that appeared to be the same exact design, same relative altitude, followed the first craft but at a much higher rate of speed, higher than any aircraft id ever seen flying that low, I spent hours outside after that watching but no other unusual occurences.  Both aircraft made relatively no sound for the speed and size of the aircraft.  Will provide sketch and map of where I was and exact direction of crafts if requested by an investigator;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
