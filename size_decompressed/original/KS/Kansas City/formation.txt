I have two different sightings at different dates and times within days of each other.  On August 16th, 2011 at 17:00 in Kansas City, I was looking out my sixth floor window, facing N.E., when I noticed an unusual object. This object was higher than most planes I see.  This rectangular object appeared as a two-story building, but on its side, not tall as a building.  I remember thinking how it was not very long.  There were evenly spaced rectangular, well-lit openings which I thought at first were windows, but later I realized since they were far away, they had to be more like doors.  Although I did not count them, it seemed there were only about 8 of these openings on the first layer, then below them there were identical openings.  This building was very still, not moving for about 15-20 seconds.  Then it moved slowly and disappeared.  This object bothered me, but I decided not to report it since I did not have a picture or video. Then on August 20th, at 21:15, I looked close to where the “building” had been, just slightly west of there and I saw 8 orbs, almost like stars, but in a loose group together.  They were a little larger than stars, all the same size.  None of them moved at this time.  After around 10 seconds three of the orbs on the outer edge of the entire group started to move slowly as the others remained motionless.  Taking turns, the first orb of the smaller group went behind a neighboring orb and disappeared.  Of the smaller group this left two and again, an orb went behind the other and disappeared, leaving one and then it disappeared.  They did not leave, they just ceased to be in my sight.  As soon the last orb was gone, the remaining larger group of about 5 orbs moved slowly at the same time but did not go very far.  Then they all repeated the same actions of the first group, going behind each other until they were gone, although they went more than one at a time as before, disappe! aring quicker than the first group.  Wondering how these orbs disappeared, perhaps they were actually going into something that was cloaked, thus disappearing from sight.  Since there were two sightings of mine, I deemed this significant so I am reporting them, though I have no pictures or video.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
