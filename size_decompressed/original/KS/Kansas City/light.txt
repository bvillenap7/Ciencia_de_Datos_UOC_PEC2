Cluster of lights spotted in sky over Kansas City, KS, moving at incredible rate of speed east toward KC, MO;2011-08-19 21:09:00;1 minute?;Cluster of lights spotted in sky over Kansas City, KS, moving at incredible rate of speed east toward KC, MO Traveling East on I-70 in Kansas City, KS saw two clusters of white lights in the sky.  Took note because not a location for lights.   While watching lights changed formation, and began to move away from it's present location heading east as well toward Kansas City, MO.   Lights moved slowley at first then picked up speed and moved far enough in to the distance we could no longer see them.  Four our five seconds later we noticed a singular light almost over head.  It hovered for a moment and quickly moved into the distance as well, traveling north east. In both cases once the lights began to move, they moved in to the distance in seconds, easily traveling faster than our moving vehicle.   Dissaperated into the distance faster than a commercial plane normaly appears to move.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
Fast moving light.;2013-03-02 19:00:00;5;Fast moving light. This was on a crisp night, what I mean by that is there was no clouds in the sky. I was headed north after picking up my son from daycare.  As I was coming to a stop light at the intersection I noticed out of my upper peripheral suddle movement.  Nothing side to side or eratic just moving forward at a speed like a plane would heading in the same direction. When I came to a complete stop the light was blocked by the roof of my car along with the stars.  My upper peripheral catches movement again as the light moves from out of the blockage of the roof and I look up.  At this point my eyes are locked onto this light, no more peripheral.  You can see movement out the side of your eye and it could be anything but when I locked eyes on the object I saw it was too high to make out a shape with no blinking lights of a plane but low enough to know it wasn't a star, and it was moving.  Any sound that the object might of had was block out by music. After maybe 3 seconds of looking at the light I seen it cut real hard and fast at an angle away from earth.  The best way I can describe how it took off is Star Trek warp speed.  It went out in space and the only thing that was missing was the blink of light at the end.

Four Light Objects Moving Fast from East To West over Kansas City 3/17/2017 9:45 pm;2017-03-17 21:45:00;12 seconds;Four Light Objects Moving Fast from East To West over Kansas City 3/17/2017 9:45 pm When looking to the west of Kansas City.  Viewing stars on a clear night sky.  A fast moving light caught my eye.  Coming from the east headed west.  Appeared to turn, or bank right, and faded out of sight. Sighting lasted 2 to 3 seconds.  Bright white in color, and would estimate it to be traveling at a elevation of at least 60,000 ft. or higher. Then about 7 seconds later.  Coming from east again, headed west.  I see three bright lights moving fast.  Headed in the same direction as the first object.  Two in front were side by side, with the third following behind the front one on the right. Sighting of those three lasted for about 2 to 3 seconds.  Estimated elevation of 60,000 ft. Moving to fast to be satelliteâ€™s.

Satellite Looking Star Stopped In Orion's Belt;2018-01-08 00:02:00;4 minutes;Satellite Looking Star Stopped In Orion's Belt What appeared to be a satellite travelled from the Southwest of Kansas City toward the Northeast.  I've lived at my location for 20 years, and have never seen a satellite because of the light pollution.  I watched it enter toward Orion's Belt for about a minute, then it stopped.  I observed it in a stopped posItion for around 3 minutes.  It was slightly brighter than any star, but was too high to be a conventional aircraft.  It looked like a star.  I went indoors to get a video camera, and when I went back outside 1 minute later, it was gone.  Nothing else in the sky in the direction it was travelling was moving.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068

4-5 small very bright green lights moving around in different directions, then zooming off, leaving a streak of light and disappearing.;2020-08-22 20:45:00;25 seconds;4-5 small very bright green lights moving around in different directions, then zooming off, leaving a streak of light and disappearing. Pulling into my subdivision after dark, I observed 4-5 green glowing round lights, about golf ball size or slightly bigger, near some brush by a pond in a field across from our home.  These lights were scattering around in close vicinity to one another and in no particular pattern.  When I slowed down to see what it could be, the lights zipped off into different directions, almost acting confused at which way to go, with one zooming across the front of my car about 25-30 ft at a speed that I can't even put into words.  It zoomed by faster than anything I have ever seen in my life. The light itself was also like something I have never seen, as it was round in shape and very bright yet slightly translucent at the same time. As the one particular ball of light, which I feel could be classified as an orb, that chose to head across the street in my direction, it left a bright green, and not completely straight streak behind it due to how fast it was traveling. (I a! m estimating about 20-30ft long). I turned my head as it passed in front of my car to track where this light going and it just disappeared. All of this happened within a matter of a few seconds. The other lights all zipped into different directions and only seemed to go about 10ft or so before disappearing into an open field. There also wasn't any noise. It was dark out, and no one was around or out and about. I even sat there in my car for a few seconds, just trying to wrap my head around what just happened and all was quiet and still. (As an added detail, there is a military base about 20 minutes from our house. All of this was taking place about 10-20ft off the ground).;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
