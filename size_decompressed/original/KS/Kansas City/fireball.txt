Seconds later the four objects became one and looked like a huge fireball falling fast from the sky.   My husband thought is might be space junk.  I thought it might be an airline part that was on fire.   This object fell for about 45 seconds and then it appeared as four objects again traveling in different directions.   All four objects then leveled off and went behind a small cloud and then it disappeared.  It was really something to see.
