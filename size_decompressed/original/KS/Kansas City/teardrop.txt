I was sitting on my deck which faces north.  I was watching the air traffic pattern for planes taking off at Kansas City International Airport.  My 4 yr old was in my lap and we had just been discussing birds.  He pointed at a black object which appeared to be floating upward from my left(wsw). It ascended like a baloon which is what I first thought it to be.  However I noticed what appeared to be several shape changes,including yhe final form which looked like an egg with short stubby wings. It rose to roughly 3-5000ft and appeared to hover.  I expected the balloon  to either be blown further away by upper atmosphere winds or to eventually rise high enough to not be seen by the naked eye.  Upper level clouds came in and eventually obscured my vision.  I did not have my Binoculars much to my disappointment.  I estimate that the thing travelled a minimum of about 3 miles to the north,based on the guess that it was a balloon.  However balloons don't maintain position against upper air currents.  It may have been larger, so my estimation of distance would obviously be off.  Aircraft taking off from KCI were taking off southbound.  At least 3 took off and went east. They did not pass close enough for me to compare in size.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
