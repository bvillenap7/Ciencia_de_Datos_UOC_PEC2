Cigar shaped object next to jet;2012-08-17 12:00:00;45 seconds;Cigar shaped object next to jet I saw an object to west of a jet traveling south in the high noon position.  Jet was high enough to create a clear contrail which did not obscure the viewing of the object.   Object was similar in shape to jet without wings, possibly longer.  It was not moving.  The jet was about 100 yards away and continued south, while the object remained stable.   The “ufo” was silver/white in color and remained in the same position for at least 45 seconds.  I was unable to follow any longer as I was moving out of viewing position.  The sky was clear with no clouds at all.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
Thin cigar horizontal red pulsating light flying south over downtown Kansas City MO.;2017-12-14 22:45:00;20 seconds;Thin cigar horizontal red pulsating light flying south over downtown Kansas City MO. I was a passenger in a car traveling westbound on I-670/70 out of downtown Kansas City, MO during the evening of December 14 at approximately 10:45 PM Central Time.  My point of view was on the Kansas side looking East towards the downtown KCMO skyline. At this time I saw a horizontal cigar-shaped, thin red light at the same approximate height of the skyline.  It appeared to be either behind or almost directly over downtown.  The width of the light was approximately the same width of many of the skyscrapers. The light would pulse uniformly on and off similar to an aircraft, but there were no other colors or pinpoints of individual lights, just one solid horizontal red light. I-670 curves to the south just outside of downtown, so during this portion of the travel I could see the craft moving south with us.  It then cleared the skyline and was flying over the shorter buildings due south of downtown, confirming it was not a strip of lights at the top of one of the skyscrapers. I lost sight of it once the road curved due West and downtown was no longer in view.  I was so mesmerized by what I was looking at that it didn’t occur to try and snap a photo.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
