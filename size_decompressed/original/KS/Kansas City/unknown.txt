I awoke from a dream in which I met alien beings and government (?) collaborator to notice a very bright or flashing light outside my bedroom window. I went to the window and saw a craft of some type (shape indeterminate) against the night sky and it had a pusling/strobing very bright blue light on the underside in center as it silently moved from south to north and way from my house.  I may be an abductee, I don't know, but all my life I have had strange sightings, including many 1960's a daytime sight -ting of a tumbling or rolling vehicle or satellite absolutely silent and traveling north to south. I'd like to talk with anyone who has had any similar sightings. Please report your event and maybe NUFOR Center will put us in touch with each other. I am only trying to verify and understand what I saw. Thank you.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
Orange object over city.;1999-10-10 04:00:00;5-10 min.;Orange object over city. Hello I wanted to report a UFO I seen while flying back from Las Vegas to Indianapolis on Oct. 10 1999. At about 4 to 5 AM. Indiana time I think that's Central Time? I was traveling on ATA flight 142 scheduled to depart Vegas at 12:25 AM but due to boarding problems it was about 12:45 before we took off. The captain did not keep us updated on our locations so I'm not sure exactly where we were? I was sitting on the right side of the plane with a view to the south. It was a very large city we were flying over maybe Kansas City but I'm not sure. The object was orange in color and appeared to be just hovering over the city. There were orange lights on each side that blinked several times and then pauses in a repeated sequence. This object and it's blinking lights were orange and not red like you see on an airplane and that caught my attention. As best as I could tell the object appeared to stay over the city as we flew away. I don't know what it was or where we were but I thought I would report it in case this may back up some other report. Sorry I can't provide more info but I was very tired.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
Stationary light streaks across the sky at the speed of a shooting star after being stationary. 1 second stationary 1 second moving out;2019-11-08 20:55:00;3 seconds;Stationary light streaks across the sky at the speed of a shooting star after being stationary. 1 second stationary 1 second moving out I just had left work, was on my way home, and was randomly looking up at the stars. I had noted various stars and also some relatively slow moving airplanes off in the distance identified by their lights creeping very slowly across the sky and blinking as they do. All of the sudden I noticed a brighter than the rest light that appeared as a dot like a star but larger and brighter and completely stationary/not moving. As soon as I looked at it literally 1 second after I locked eyes onto whatever it was it streaked across the sky out of sight off into the horizon at what seemed like the speed of a shooting star. I was shook at what I had just witnessed all in 2 seconds. I kept telling myself it has to of been a shooting star but then how would it be possible for it to be stationary as it was when I had first made eye contact with it. I cannot explain what I had witnessed with a sober mind and absolutely history of seeing things that arenâ€™t there. What I have j! ust seen defies any reasonable explanation. Whatever I witnessed could be clearly differentiated from anything known.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
