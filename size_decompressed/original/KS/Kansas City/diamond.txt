At that time it was emitting a white light traveling in a straight line.  It then vanish for a while when I saw it again it appeared as if it was floating but it could have been traveling toward me.  It seemed as if it was twinkling it was a light violet or pale pink over white.  It floated for awhile then vanished.   I'm a retired postal worker.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
