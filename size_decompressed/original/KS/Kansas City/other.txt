She stated that it was an orange colored Glowing round object leaving a trail behind it.  She also stated that she was traveling north, on her street, and the object was seen traveling from east to west. It was exactlly 23:41 I was working on patrol and my car phone rang.  I am a police supervisor for one of the local cities in the Kansas City area.  My girlfriend called me very upset because she had just seen an object.  The following is her description as best I can remember.  She was traveling north on the street she lives and the object was seen in the sky to her north, but she stated it was towards the end of her block.  The height that she described was only described as lower than an airplane would fly.  She stated that the object was flying slowly from the east to the west.  She stated that it gave her the feeling that it was going to come after her, so she huried inside her home.  She stated that as she was walking in she was still watching it and after traveling slowly it shot west very fast.  She described it as a glowing object, and one that left a trail.  I asked her to call and she wouldn't because she was at home and  it was late. ( Her parents are elderly).

2 F - 16 fighter jets and black helicopter Circle in formation;2007-06-17 10:00:00;1 hour;2 F - 16 fighter jets and black helicopter Circle in formation I was sitting on my porch with my daughter at 10:00 am talking to some friends . And we all watched 2 F-16 fighter jets fly overhead in a alert formation which is unusual in this area . Shortly after the jets came a solid black helicopter flying west in the same direction . Then the jets passed by another 5 or 6 times heading west as well . This all took place inbetween 10 am and 11 am , I havent heard of any airshows going on in my area and thought maybe they could have been scrambled for a reason . If there were any sightings in my area around this time and were reported this may be the reason for this .;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
Rectangular connected series of glass globes with exhaust...;2009-07-24 00:15:00;40 SECONDS;Rectangular connected series of glass globes with exhaust... I saw an unusual craft flying overhead today at approx 12:15 am CDT. It looked like a series of glass globes, possible six, in tandem with an afterburner/exhaust and very unusual lights on it, although it had a blinking red light on what was the rear section. It also had three bands of marquee-like lights on the bottom. There were lights between some of the sections and internally. I have never seen this type of craft before nor read any accounts of it. (You may post this if you wish...I did not have anyway to draw then post to internet so I found a program called draw where I made a sketch of the general shape.  The smaller circle at the end represents the exhaust or afterburner the rectangles represent the three strips of marquee like lights which were solidly on...they did not blink,,,,and the small circle the red light which was flashing on and off. I am emailing you seperately the 'drawing  as an jpg I made using draw online software.)   I don't know if it was of earth or beyond, but it was impressive, and much larger than a typical jet.  It sounded like a typical jet but the light patterns and shape dispelled similarity to a typical jet. It made the sound of a typical jet albeit louder than average, and it appeared much larger than typical jet, if I held my arm at full length and measured using fingers I would say it appeared four inches in length, about 1/2 inch in width against the night sky.  I would estimate it was way less than 30,000 feet --maybe 10,000 feet up. <To match drawing being mailed seperately please look for KCSHAPE in tagline of my sepearte email.>;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
White object stalled vehicle;2012-01-27 02:00:00;20 seconds;White object stalled vehicle Driving from KC to Norton, KS.  GPS did not take us I70 route so we were driving on dark roads.   Object darted across the highway in front of the car so close that the driver thought he had hit the object.   It was all white like a light.  Vehicle completely stalled and all electronics in the car shut off.   Driver checked outside and found no damage and came back in the vehicle white as a ghost.   Car and electronics came back on within minutes.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
Pyramid Drone over KC, Kansas. Morphed to oblong oval before disappearing.;2012-09-28 19:05:00;2-3 minutes;Pyramid Drone over KC, Kansas.  Morphed to oblong oval before disappearing. In our backyard, my girlfriend had noticed a bright helicopter light, probably 10-15 miles away. We often focus on these things, in hopes, to one day see a UFO for ourselves.  As the light moved closer towards us from the south east, the object took a shape.  To our astonishment, the object was pyramid shaped.  The light that was on the vehicle was set at the base of the pyramid.  This light did not have beam like qualities, but it seemed to be spotting.  The craft would stop, rotate the light around the body, stop the light to observe something, then continue on it's path.  We watched as the object moved closer and closer.  After about 2 minutes the object was probably 2 miles away from us at the most.  It was BIG!  There also seemed to be some kind of &quotHeat-wave&quot aura around it, like heat waves you see coming off of the hot streets in the summer.  There were no sounds that we could hear from the object.  At its closest point to us, estimating about 2 miles, the object turned towards the South west.  Before the craft disappeared behind the trees, it had sort of morphed into a more oval/oblong shape.  As soon as the thing had left our sight, we dashed for the car.  We traveled down I 635 in hopes to find the path of the object.  There was no trace of this object!  One thing to note: few seconds after this had left our sight, a large commercial like plane flew pretty low in the same direction as the ufo. We find this odd because there is no major airport to the sw of us.;39.0038863112378;-94.7085401657068
