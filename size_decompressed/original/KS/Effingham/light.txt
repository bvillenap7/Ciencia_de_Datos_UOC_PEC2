Bright light that makes a square turn then back on path;2016-06-26 21:35:00;8 seconds;Bright light that makes a square turn then back on path It was 9:35pm and me and my daughter were out sitting by the fire at our house and we like to try and spot satellites and we noticed a really bright light in the south headed in the path we normally see satellites but never this bright.   So I grabbed my phone and started recording and the object was headed north and it made a sudden turn square turn towards the east then back north then west then back north like it was going around something not visible to me then had erratic speed after that then I had my view blocked by our trees so only have 8 seconds of video but great video.;39.5169;-95.404
