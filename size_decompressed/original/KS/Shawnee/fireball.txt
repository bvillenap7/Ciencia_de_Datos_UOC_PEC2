Observed a slow moving fireball moving from north to south.  The fireball was silent and did not resemble anything I have ever seen.  We watched it slowly turn around and then head back north taking.  The light stayed the same as the object turned and changed direction, unlike headlights or afterburners where if you saw them turn the light would dim.  The object then moved away, but was followed by a second identical object following the same course.   Again, no sound.
