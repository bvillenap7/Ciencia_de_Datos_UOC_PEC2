Group of v-shaped lights doing complex movements.;2017-02-15 20:00:00;Seconds;Group of v shaped lights doing complex movements. I was out on my deck stargazing started praying to my guardian angel/spirit guides for help in my life. and right then I noticed a v shaped formation of 15-20 lighted objects flying over me that I thought at first were geese.  But then I realized it was lights and geese don't light up.  And I didn't hear any honks either.   Then I saw the lights in the v shape start rearranging  in complex movements.  It flew over my house and I looked around the side of the house and it had disappeared.  It moved faster than the other triangular ones I read about I bet.  I have no doubt that it appeared for me.  I will try to get a photo if it happens again.;39.0439316483518;-94.7154072527471
