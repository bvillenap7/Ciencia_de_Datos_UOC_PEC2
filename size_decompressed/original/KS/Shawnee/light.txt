Bright light in the sky flashing.;2002-09-26 22:36:00;3 min.;Bright light in the sky flashing. I was just getting ready for bed when I looked out the window and saw what appeared to be something like a stadium light floating in the sky.  It wasn't moving just flashing on and off and it was very bright and had an amberish color to it.  Aircraft on approach to KCI were flying just a little higher than the light adn the light i was watching had 4 lights on top and 3 on bottom kind of like a stadium light except for the color and flashing.  Watchign the lights I had a warm feeling on my face.  When I went to wake up some of my friends that were over and already sleeping I took them over and the light was gone.  In all the light lasted about 3 minutes and it was just a strange sight to see.;39.0439316483518;-94.7154072527471

They looked like stars that were moving in a straight trajectory.;2016-02-05 20:00:00;15 minutes;They looked like stars that were moving in a straight trajectory. They looked like stars moving.  Seen three separate lights moving together in a long triangle formation heading in one direction.  Seen single moving lights going in different directions in a straight trajectory.  They were flying above the clouds mostly.  They were the size of a normal star and color of most stars, a white light.  Most were traveling East and West, some traveling North and South.  They would stay flying in a straight trajectory direction.  There light stayed solid did not blink or flash.  They were each 1 solid light.  They all looked the same.  They looked to be flying higher than a normal aircraft was that was also in the area.  Lasted for about 10 or 15 minutes, then I didn't see them anymore.  Seen them while at Gum Springs Park.  It was cloudy.  Moving about as fast as a normal airplane.;39.0439316483518;-94.7154072527471
