The object appeared from behind us and moved into our line of sight.  It made a swooping motion and the continued south out of our site.  It seemed fairly small but we couldn't tell how high it was.  I would estimate it as being a little higher than the trees.  It had a glowing light green color. We heard no sound.  It seemed to be moving very quickly.;39.0439316483518;-94.7154072527471
