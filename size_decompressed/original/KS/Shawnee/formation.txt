Lights in the sky in Shawnee, KS;2012-11-11 20:30:00;30 minutes;Lights in the sky in Shawnee, KS At 8:30 pm on Sunday night my family was sitting outside and one person saw a strange formation in the sky.  She pointed it out to the rest of us and we watched it.  It appeared to be shaped like a boomarang.  It had dim lights on the front and was well below the stars.  We have been watching it for over a hour now.  It is going from North to South, then circling and going North to South again.  We now have 7 people watching it.  We spot it about every 5 to 10 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.0439316483518;-94.7154072527471
