The size of a grapefruit ball of light moving through the sky.;2012-04-20 21:00:00;30seconds;The size of a grapefruit ball of light moving through the sky. I took my dog out for one last potty break and all of a sudden I see a ball of light appear.  First it moved slow and then all of a sudden it swiftly moved across the sky.  At first I thought it could of been a flying squirrel that I had seen before in past Springs, but soon realized it was in the sky!  It was a ball of light that first moved slowly and then quickly moved out of sight.  No other lights or reflections were visible.;39.0439316483518;-94.7154072527471
3 circles flying close together, motionless, and without a sound!;2012-11-12 01:00:00;~10 seconds;3 circles flying close together, motionless, and without a sound! It was 1am and I was letting the dogs out.  I was admiring the clear sky and the bright stars when I saw 3 circles moving together in a straight line.  I saw it less than 10 seconds... But enough to scare me.  It wasn't birds... No flapping or fluttering.  Not a plane or helicopter... Moved across the sky too quickly and didn't even make a sound.  The flight was direct... Didn't steer off path.  Was from northeast heading southwest.  I hope someone else described this thing!;39.0439316483518;-94.7154072527471
