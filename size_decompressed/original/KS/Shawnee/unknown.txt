Very  shiny bright , moving faster than anything I ever saw.;2008-06-21 13:00:00;20 seconds;Very  shiny bright , moving faster than anything I ever saw. I was sitting on patio studying. It faces WEST. There is a fence about 40feet from my chair.There are homes on the other side of the fence. From this chair my view is mostly toward the sky at about a 45 degree angle. There a few fairly small trees with at least twenty feet between them. They  are in a North to South alignment.(North to my right.) Bright, sunshine day. As I was drink from a soft drink bottle, I was looking up and to my right when I noticed a very  bright spot, like light reflecting from a mirror. I have observed commerical aircraft in flight of about this size. Ther speed at a few hunderd miles per hour would have taken at least 20 minutes to travel what this did in 10 to 12 seconds. It was easy to discount military because their paint is to reduce light reflection and commerical aircraft are painted also, and not be  brightly reflective. Iam a very observant person. I would judge this to be about single engine aircraft size at this distance. (No sound);39.0439316483518;-94.7154072527471
