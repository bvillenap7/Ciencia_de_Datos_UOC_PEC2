Very Bright Lights;2004-10-28 21:50:00;30 seconds;My husband,eleven year old son and I were coming home from a football game Oct. 28th 2004 at 9:30 p.m. We topped the hill towards our home in rural Cheyenne County and there were two large,round,VERY BRIGHT lights. They were lined up horizontally and were about 30 degrees above the horizon. I thought it was an airliner in trouble and trying to land. After 20 or 30 seconds the lights faded away. The lights then reappeared vertically and again faded away. It was a clear night and no planes in the sky. We arrived home a few minutes later and discussed what we had seen. It was not a falling star, aircraft, weather balloon or fireworks.;39.68;-101.9122
