A round silver disc craft with three bright lights.;2012-04-23 05:00:00;5 minutes;A round silver disc craft with three bright lights. When I was driving on the I-35 interstate headed towards Salina, when I noticed a round silver shape craft with three bright lights  spinning and holding still for a little bit, and then  I drove past the craft and then the craft started to follow my car so I spead up to 80 and the craft was right there at the same speed and then I slowed down to 50 MPH and the craft slowed down by this time it started to freak me out a little, so I pulled off on to side and the craft made a loud powering up sound kinda like you have heard on star trek and then the craft shot straight up and the speed of the craft was at least 500 to 1000 miles hour in one to two seconds it was gone, this was my first sighting in KS.   In 1981 I lived in Grants Pass, OR, me and my family would lay out in lawn chairs on Friday and Saturday night in the summer time and watch ufo's  in the sky most of time there would be several crafts flying in a circal for an hour and then shoot off in different ! directions.

Three very fast moving circular brightly glowing objects.;2015-07-04 23:45:00;5 minutes;Three very fast moving circular brightly glowing objects. Three circular brightly glowing orangish objects in an assembly.  They were moving at a very fast speed, and then one shot off in another direction at light speed.   About 10 minutes later, another one followed.  Unsure if it was one of the first ones or a seperate one.   Photos and video do what we saw no justice.   Unlike anything I have ever seen before.;38.3746;-97.673
