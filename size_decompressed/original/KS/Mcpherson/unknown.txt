Blue, red, and purple lights shooting north.;2013-06-07 22:30:00;3 minutes;Blue, red, and purple lights shooting north. We were stargazing and saw a blue light moving North very, very quickly.  Soon after, there were more underneath and to the side of it in blue, red and purple colors (5-10). They were moving so fast it was breathtaking. Everything was silent, then all of the neighborhood dogs started going crazy.;38.3746;-97.673
