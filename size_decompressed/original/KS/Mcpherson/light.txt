Bright light over I-135 around McPherson, KS.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-24 14:00:00;15 seconds;Bright light over I135 around McPherson, KS. Was driving South on I135, and a bright light appeared in the windshield about 45 degrees high in the sky.  It was straight South of our location, directly over I135, and was not moving.   At first, I thought maybe it was a traffic drone, with the Sun reflecting off of it.  It had to be -17 or so in brightness.  I alerted my son, and he saw it too.  After about 15 seconds, it just went away, like flipping off a light switch!   I check heavensabove.com for daytime Iridium flares or satellites, and none were listed.  The Sun was at about 70 degrees, SSW, so it could not have reflected off of any flying craft.  The light source had to be generated by the object.
