Bright slow moving star that dissapeared;2002-09-29 22:41:00;30 Sec.;Bright slow moving star that dissapeared I was taking out the trash when i noticed out of the corner of my eye what i thought was the north star. While walkin i thought to myself, it looks like its moving, not again!. I didnt even look up yet, but its happed to me before, several times, in different parts of the counrty. Anyway, i put the trash away then walk back to the pourch before lookin up to see if i was right.  Sure eought, bright star, moving slowly, i watched it for at least 30 sec. plus the time i was walking. As i watched it move, it did what they always do, faded slowly and was gone. About 10 min. later 3 choppers, the double bladed ones fallowed the same path as it.  Also seen in Topeka KS, Agawam MA, Holton KS, total times ive seen it 5.
