At approximately 10:30, on Saturday, March 29th, 2014, a lot of bright, orange, round lights were observed by several people. They were relatively low flying in a straight line from the south to the north-northwest.  They were west of our location.  They made absolutely no noise and were evenly spaced in a straight line.  To the north they would kind of group up before some would disappear.  From the time they came into sight until they grouped it took about 6 seconds. I saw several of them before I called for my wife to come look.  After my wife got there she counted 15 of these lights.  My wife was on the phone and had our son and daughter in law go outside and look at the sky.  They also saw them. I used my iPad to film them for a short time.  The video does not show their true formation because I was so excited I did not hold it steady and it looks like they are zig-zagging all over the place.  This continued for nearly 20 to 30 minutes.;37.5186;-95.6482
