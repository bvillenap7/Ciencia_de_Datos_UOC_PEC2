One‚Äùappears near the horizon but above the buildings on W Santa Fe Ave (south side), the 2nd (Two) appeared 2 minutes later, again much higher in the sky and to the north. They hovered from 20:24, until about 21:30. At 21:15, One faded in and out again, glowing red, then disappeared.  There was quite a bit of lightning to the north and west and cloud cover prevented me from seeing if it reappeared due east of Burlingame(66413) I thought I saw two others converge and maintain a single stance  to the southeast of One;38.7634;-95.84
