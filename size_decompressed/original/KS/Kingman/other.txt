I saw an aircraft i cannot explain.;2006-03-02 06:25:00;5 MIN;I saw an aircraft i cannot explain. I was getting in truck to leave for work,  I had the feeling of static electricty on my neck, uncomfortable, there was a humm, I can't tell you if I was hearing or feeling it, but there was a humm. As i looked around, I looked up, I saw a craft in the air.  I wasn't sure of what I was seeing.  I served in the Air Force, I live and work near an airport.  I have never seen anything like this.  Round on the back to a point at the front, like an arrow head.  It wasn't flying it was just there,  Size wise, I would say half a football field, 50 yards.  It' surface appeard to be changing in color as it moved from morning darkness, to sunrise. I watched till I could no longer see it. I thought to myself, Tax Dollars at work.  As I have gone thru the day thinking about it.  I don't think this was out tax dollars at work, I think I saw something extratestrial.;37.5964;-98.1304
