3 lights in southwest sky.  Molten fire dripped from one and the other shot out red streaks.;2008-02-11 23:00:00;hours;3 lights in southwest sky.  Molten fire dripped from one and the other shot out red streaks. Frigid, cloudy, dark night.  Three lights were in the Southwest sky.  Were in a row at first.  Lights blinked on and off.  Saw what appeared to be molten fire dripping from one light.  Lights would look like they each broke into smaller pieces and then congeal again into one.  Looked like red streaks would come from the center light toward the other lights.  Then the two outer lights would disppear and smaller lights would take their place. The middle light appeared to zig zag rapidly back and forth but would not really leave it's position in the sky.  The whole scene appeared to be like a Star Wars battle. I am still watching this and have been doing so for 2 hours. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.0637;-94.6591
3-4 amber and 2 white lights flickered and danced in the SW sky.;2008-02-21 07:00:00;5 hours;3-4 amber and 2 white lights flickered and danced in the SW sky. I reported a similar event on Feb. 11, 2008. 4 adults saw these new lights. Again,  it was cloudy and very cold.  Ice on trees, grass, etc. 2 amber lights appeared to be flashing and jumping around in SW sky. They would go out and a couple of white lights would appear and then go out. Red stuff came out of one amber light and fell towards the ground.  Took pictures on digital camera and camcorder....nothing showed up on either film.  Lasted from 7pm to midnight. Speculation is that the lights are reflections off of iced covered tree tops.  Lights on Feb. 11 were really close and then lingered further off to the SW.  These lights last night didn't get out of their original area of observation. The power lines close to our house were sizzling.
