6 to 9 dots of light in uneven formation;1974-07-15 19:00:00;10 seconds;6 to 9 dots of light in uneven formation I was 13 at the time. Our family was heading West to a restaruant that evening. Not sure of the time or date(guessed as close as I could). In the West I saw 6 to 9 dots of light far away about 45 degrees high. They were in a strange uneven formation. Somewhat like a checkmark. They were slowly moving to the right then reversed and went back to the left. Then made a few more quick zig zags that weren't quite 180's. Then finally shot out of sight to my top right, all while staying in this uneven formation. At that young age I realized that movement wasn't natural. Around the year 1997 while watch a UFO show on TV, I saw a very similar formation if not the same, I believe it was footage from Mexico. It really brought back the moment.

I witnessed three lights for 2 seconds in triangle formation shooting towards the earth off in the distance.;2009-02-16 03:40:00;2 seconds;I witnessed three lights for 2 seconds in triangle formation shooting towards the earth off in the distance. I would say it looked exactly like a shooting star, except it was three white lights in triangle formation. Two lights on bottom and one on top moving extremely fast towards the earth, up to down movement, disappearing without a flare like shooting star usually do when they burn in atmosphere.  This was off in the distance towards the eastern direction night sky, over in Missouri side of state line.  It was only two seconds if not one second.  I almost did not say anything about this quick moment until I heard on CNN of more UFO sightings in Texas, today.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Two orange lights over Kansas City;2011-07-06 22:00:00;~ 5 Minutes;Two orange lights over Kansas City As I left my apartment this evening for my weekly trip to the laundry room, I was struck by the sight of two bright orange lights in the sky.  It was hard to judge their distance, but they must've been at least a mile from my position.   They were curiously bright- not blinding, but well defined and certainly not planes or helicopters.   I stopped briefly to observe them, and two of my neighbors, who had just pulled in, joined me.  We speculated about what they might be, and as it's July 6th, I posited that they might've been a sort of firework.   My neighbors rejected this immediately, and admittedly I'm not familiar with with any fireworks that behave as these lights did.  As I said though, the lights were already in the sky when I noticed them, so I can't speak to their ascent, but once in the sky they did move upwards, downwards, left, and right (slowly) despite it being a still night.   After observing the lights for a minute or two, I continued into the la! undry room, and when I returned they were gone. I did have my phone on me at the time, but I'm sure the lights weren't significant enough to register on the phone's shoddy camera. Describing them plainly as two orange balls of light is perfectly accurate. A bit of background on myself...  I was, and still am, skeptical about the existence of sentient alien life.  I think these lights could reasonably be dismissed as fireworks, although I can't explain their duration or behavior.  It looked like something straight out of a bad UFO TV special, and could've easily been some sort of light attached to a balloon, but it's testament to the sighting that they were impressive enough for me to bother googling this website and submitting a report. I'm not, however, interested in following up on this sighting or volunteering any personal information.   Thank you.

5 red lights moving up into the sky, flicker out.;2012-02-05 21:15:00;2 minutes;5 red lights moving up into the sky, flicker out. Facing north we saw 5 lights moving up in the sky.  As they reached a certain height, they flickered out, one at a time.  The balls of light were red.  They did not blink, but moved more like fire or a flare, but moved up, not down.  As the last one faded out, an object moved closer by through the sky, silently, and moved all the way across the sky.  It was balloon shaped and reddish pink in the reflected light of the parking lot and city lights.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Two flickering lights seen above the eastern horizon of Overland Park.;2013-12-10 20:00:00;~30 seconds;Two flickering lights seen above the eastern horizon of Overland Park. After performing a concert at Blue Valley West High Schoo,l my brother and I went to my car and on the way we saw 2 yellow-orange flickering dots of light above the eastern horizon.  the dots were positioned in such a way that The upper dot was a little bit to the right of the bottom.  If you were to draw a line between them out would be at about a 60 degree angle.  These dots did not appear to be moving.  After about 20 seconds, the bottom dot faded away.  It took less than a second to fade away. 2 to 5 seconds later the other dot faded away.  However it took longer to fade away than the first.  It took about 1.5 seconds to fade away.  I'm pretty interested in aliens and the like.  My brother was pretty skeptic about the idea that it was a ufo but we couldn't find any other logical explanation.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Dozens of pinpoint lights in random formation traveling in the same direction at various speeds.  ((Starlink satellites??));2017-10-16 21:00:00;1.5 minutes;Dozens of pinpoint lights in random formation traveling in the same direction at various speeds. My kids and I were outside in our driveway at approximately 9:00pm on 10/16/17. My daughter drew my attention to many pinpoints of light flying overhead. They appeared to me to look and move the way a satellite appears in the sky however, they did not appear as if they were at height altitude because the pinpoints looked brighter and just seemed like they were not that high in the air. As I stated they tracked like a satellite, we’re moving in the same direction and not uniform. They moved at different speeds with some passing others, The speeds were not that fast while some moved faster than others. No audible sound. There were probably no more than 5 in any given ‘row’. This phenomenon was observed for at least one minute as we just looked up in amazement as they passed up. This event scared my 12 year old daughter. I have never seen anything like this and could only compare the points of light to how a satellite looks in the sky having only seen one at an! astronomical meet. I told my daughter that this is what a  UFO is. It only means that we don’t know what it is, not that it must be alien. At that time I could only guess that could have been drones which I also found hard to believe. A coworker told me it could have been re-entry debris form a satellite or something. I have just today discovered that the Pentagon has developed drone swarms. I would expect a drone swarm at night to look like what we  saw. The problem is there are no Air Force bases that close to Overland Park,KS and I have to wonder about fuel/battery life. Also, why over this suburban community. I do not believe in ghosts nor do I believe aliens are flying around among us. I don’t know what they were but I believe there is reasonable explanation.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Bright lights merge into V formation and vanish.;2019-11-30 21:35:00;3 to 4 mins;Bright lights merge into V formation and vanish. I was driving home from work on Saturday, November 30th at approximately 9:35 pm (CST) when I noticed bright lights darting across the clouds in the sky.  At first I thought they might be searchlights, but they kept changing shape.  They went from circular to oval and were flickering as they darted across the sky in random patterns. I continued watching the lights as I pulled into my subdivision I realized that the lights weren’t coming from earth, but shining down and glowing above the cloud line.  They suddenly began blinking and elongating into a V formation, similar to airport runway lights. (The closest airport is in Olathe, Kansas, a good fifteen minutes south west of my location.)  The lights remained in this formation, blinking three times before meeting up at the tip of the V and completely vanishing. It was the most bizarre thing I’ve ever seen in my life.  I wish I hadn’t been driving.  I would have pulled out my cell phone and recorded the lights.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412

I was facing west and the moon was full in the Northwest and on it's way to setting.  As I looked at the moon I saw something moving to the right, (northeast).  That's when I saw the convoy of lights in single file moving across the sky.  The lights passed through the big dipper, (Ursa Major), and continued to move from southwest to northeast.  I counted them As they moved across the sky, (20 of them).  As the lights reached Vega, they seemed to stop for a split second, get really bright and disappeared in a flash!  Every single one of them did the same thing. I tried to record a video on my phone but it wouldn't show up on it.  Just blackness and my breathing could only be heard with a statement from me at the end saying Holy ((deleted))!.  Summary Convoy of lights disappear in a flash!;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
