Followed object in my car for 13 blocks it stopped hung in air for 3min. then went opposite direction and was gone.;1982-06-15 14:00:00;15 min.;Followed object in my car for 13 blocks it stopped hung in air for 3min. then went opposite direction and was gone. This event happened during the summer on a cloudless day. My wife and I had stopped at a dairy store she went in as I waited in my truck. I was parked facing West about a block away was a two story building and over the top of it in the distance I saw an object that was long and wingless heading NE. The object seemed to be rotating as it went forward. As it rotated it changed color from flat black to shiney silver or reflective like chrome. Just then my wife came out of the store and I pointed it out she said to follow it. I drove North about 5 blocks West 1 block and North again for another 8 blocks. Meanwhile, the object was angling closer to our location. I was going about 35-40 mph and keeping with it. Then it slowed to a stop and hung in the air. My best guess is it was maybe 30- 50 ft. long and 200-300 feet in the air. At this point it was only about a block form my location. As we sat watching it hang there rotating chrome and flat black a young man walked by and I pointed it out to him and asked what he thought it was, he said he didn't know what it was and hurried on his way. We watched it for about two or three minutes then it started moving again. This time it headed So.E we had to go South to an East-west road and by the time we got to the next main road it gone behind the trees and we lost it. We went straight home and called the nearest AF base, Richards-Gabauer, in Missouri to report what we saw. They said they had no other reports but later that day the local weather man said the strange thing folks were seeing in the was a weather balloon. Imagine that!!

3 units observed in horizontal line with main center unit. Red, green and whits flashing lights.;2015-09-26 22:00:00;30 minutes;3 units observed in horizontal line with main center unit.  Red, green and white flashing lights. Sighting began with one set of red, white and greenlights blinking in a cigar shape. A second smaller set joined it shortly after initial sighting, on the left. After several minutes a third group of lights appeared on its right.  The main unit appeared to get larger over time as if moving towards us in a staight line. We initially thought they were airplanes until  an actual airplane passed through the area. They appeared to stay still, never moving, just hovering in the distance.  The side units eventually began to get smaller as if moving backwards in a straight line. The center unit also began to recede.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
