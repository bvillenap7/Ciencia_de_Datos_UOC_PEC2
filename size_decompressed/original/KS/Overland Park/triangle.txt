Man sees cloaked triangle shaped object slicing through clouds above his head.;2006-10-28 00:40:00;6 seconds;Man sees cloaked triangle shaped object slicing through clouds above his head. I had previously sent this report in, and had received a reply email regarding date specifics on this one. I'm wanting to know if it was going to get onto the site. It was a very scary moment for me, and really wanted others to read it.  At aprrox. 12:40 AM on Saturday 10/28/06, I stepped out for a smoke on my back deck of my townhome. It was very dark, with none of the neighbor's back porch lights on, so I really could see the stars in the night sky. There was some very large broken patches of clouds high in the sky,(I'm not too clear on elevations to judge them.) Sitting and leaning against my sliding glass window, facing South-South East, I noticed movement right above my head as I was looking toward the East (about 60 degrees up) at the stars. What I saw scared me numb and froze me still for about 30 seconds. I saw a very large 'triangle' shaped craft slicing through the bottom clouds, heading to the South just over my head, then bank toward the West as it was just going out of view from me due to the building's roof line next door to me. Now the wierdest part about 'this' sighting (this is my third at this location) was the fact that I really didn't see the craft, but viewed the clouds rolling past the front two sides of the 'invisible triangle-shape', and stir or roll the clouds behind it. There was no sound, no lights, and what I would describe as a 'stealth mode' or being invisible. I could actually see right through the shape, and a few stars on the other side. This was very frightening to see, and I wish there had been other witnesses. After I remained there 'frozen' for about 30 seconds, I ran rushed inside and went to my wife for her to feel my heart thumping in my chest, which it was.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Triangle shaped craft traveling in 'stealth' mode.;2006-10-28 00:40:00;6 seconds;Triangle shaped craft traveling in 'stealth' mode. This is my third sighting in five years and almost to the exact date of my first.  My first sighting is dated to 11/01/01 (reported here on this sight) and involved six spheres traveling over our heads in an off-set V formation, heading East (slightly South) direction.  Now these were a visual I cannot get out of my head.  They flew over my house approx. at 10:15pm with 2 witnesses. You could see the moon and clouds reflecting in each one of the spheres as they passed under and toward the (full-ish) moon, which gave off a pinkish/white color.  They had scattered lines all around each of them (like a ball of yarn) and no sounds.  I watched these fly away from us and then vanish as soon as they flew out from under the low cloud formation.  Size and distance I judged with...if you took a quarter and held it up above your head.  Very thought provoking sighting. My second sighting was on Tuesday 10/23/06 where on my same back deck around 8:30 pm, I viewed a light in the sky the was stationary, blinked bright white for three seconds, then went dark for 5 seconds, and then repeated this three times.  On the third time it went dark, it seemed to fade out.  Now I know what I saw wasn't a plane, or helocopter, star blinking, meteor, flare....etc.  It was interesting enough to watch for it again, but never saw it repeat. Now my third, which happened on Friday night/Saturday morning at 12:40am made my heart jump into my throat, and beat five time faster.  I viewed a single craft of the triangle nature slicing through the low clouds, right over my head. This craft was in what I would call 'stealth-mode' because you could not see the craft, but I could see the clouds rolling past the sides, and stearing the clouds behind it.  It traveled from the North, heading South very slowly, then banked toward the West after it passed over. I could not see it after that.  Personally, I was frozen with fear for about 20 seconds before I went inside.  It took me 2 hours to fall asleep that night, and I can still see it in my head.  I really believe I live in a 'pathway' or 'hot-spot' for these things and will keep on watching for them.  I have no pics or vids of any of these, wish I did.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412

It was very, very bright with a green/blue color to it, and from the initial quick glance, I honestly thought it was a glare and wrote it off as such. I continued home, turned into my cul-de-sac (just 30secs away from initial catching of attn). I saw two bright lights, greenish-blue, parallel to each other (mimicking a military helicopter, with the parallel and straight form) hovering steadily.  The lights weren't flashing, though. it was still and so silent. Something randomly hit me subconsciously, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. The, what i thought was helicopter, seemed to be 3mi out at that point.  I immediately grabbed my phone and fumbled to the rec. button.  And as soon as i raised my phone to rec, the aircraft instantly moved.  I was spotting it in the south, it was hovering steadily, no flashing of its green/blue lights, just hovering (thats why I thought it was just a helicopter at first. via perspective).  As soon as i lifted my phone to rec what i was seeing the craft turned and sped towards me and my daughters direction. By the time I realized that this thing was a triangle shape, it was slowly gliding over us, about 1000ft up.  It was completely silent. my initial thoughts were a giant drone, but it was eerily quiet out. It slowly moved over my head, no sound, triangular shaped, back two 'wing lights' were lit up with greenish blue lights, the rest of the craft was illuminated somehow, just not externally.  It very well could have been the extremely bright and vivid  lights of the crafts wings. As the object moved overhead towards the north, I got a good look at its underside. it was ribbed like  strips of metal work or the belly of a turtle.  the material the ship was made of wasnt shiny or prone to glare like metal.  it acted more like paper or plastic, but it undoubtedly had the resemblance of the resilience and toughness of metal. As it passed over my head, it began blinking the green and blue lights, now including red center light. It stoppped about 100yds out, backed up, did an elongated turn and continued north, still flashing its lights. I've never came across such an equally terrifying exp. and curiosity spiking exp. My daughter was freaked out. SHe calmed down fine after a bit.  Had my dog sitter tell me , with out speaking of what happened to her (I'm seriously a bit freaked out and still don't want to come off as insane as i know i sound lol), apparently my dog was unapologetically barking at the sky and very upset and something outside, heavily indicating the sky.  This was 20 min before I came home and had my exp.  Exar9uperience lasted, in all, around 5 min.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
