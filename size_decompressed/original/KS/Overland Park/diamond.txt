Had thre bright white lights in the front (creating a triangle shape) and one in the back giving it the look of an elongated diamond. Had one bright red light in the very center of the underbelly of the craft. My daughter and I were driving home from church on Wednesday March 24, 1999 and @8:00. We say an odd looking craft come out of the east flying at about 600 feet. As we turned to gead west toward home, the craft was running parellel to us (but not following us or anything). It was moving at about 50-60 miles per hour. The craft has three bright, non-blinking white light on the front underside giving it a triangle appearance, but there was also a bright white light at the back of the craft giving it a kind of long square or elongated diamond appearance. My daughter said it appeared to be square shaped to her. The body of the craft was not visible, so we determined the shape by the placement of the lights. There was also a bright red, once again unblinking, in teh very center of the under- belly of the craft. We followed it in our car heading west, and then it turned sharply to the north and continued on that wasy. We trie to follow it in the car, but traffic was unusualy heavy for that time of night (even on the side streets) and we lost it after a few minutes. I had my window down and there was no sound coming from this thing.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412

We noticed a cluster of lights in the sky that looked abnormal.  During a period of approximately two hours we watched this cluster move around in the sky. A group of at least six lights caught our attention because of their spacing.  They were very close together but initially appeared to be a star constellation.  After close observation we noticed that the lights were moving.  They would move one direction than another direction.  Their movement was very erratic at certain times.  They appeared to be traveling in unison.  Occasionally other lights would shoot out from the area of the lights.  This light would streak across the sky very faintly similar to the meteors but much fainter.  It was hard to distinguish if the six lights were one object or six different objects.  Occasionally the six lights would move so fast it would leave a streak or tail.  The object's shape was like a kite with a tail plus one extra light in the middle that was brighter than the others.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Strange Aircraft in the sky;2007-05-13 20:15:00;3 min;Strange Aircraft in the sky My fiancée and I were sitting on our deck eating dinner when we saw a strange aircraft flying from the south heading north over Overland Park at about 8:15 pm.  What I saw in the sky looked like two cones, solid gray in color, with a clear section between the upper and lower sections.  The craft move at a constant speed, altitude and direction across the sky.  The craft didn’t emit any light but the bottom section was rotating fairly fast.  It seemed to have something offset at about fifteen degrees so as it rotated, the bottom seemed to wobble.  Although the bottom was spinning, the top section was clearly stationary.  It never changed speed or direction and just few out of sight.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
