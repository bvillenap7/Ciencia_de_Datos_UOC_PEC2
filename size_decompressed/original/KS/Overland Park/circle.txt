My brother and I saw a circle that moved, made a trail, and disappeared in a minute.;1999-06-27 22:00:00;1 1/2 minutes;My brother and I saw a circle that moved, made a trail, and disappeared in a minute. My dad was driving my brother and me home.  I was looking out the window at the planet Venus, when a yellow glow caught my attention.  I watched it for sometime.  Then it sped diagonally down.  Suddenly the radio became extremely fuzzy and switched off for a moment, then switch back on.  I kept watching it intensly while asking myself what it could be.  I decided to get help in identifying it, so I beckoned my younger brother to see it.  At first he didn't know what I was talking about, then he asked me if I was talking about the line that he saw.  I turned around, confused, and saw that the circle had created a tail behind it that had started to fade away.  After the tail diminished, the circle dissapeared.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412

Black dot in sky breaks into 4 pieces--then collapses back into a single dot.  Then disappears.;2009-02-14 17:23:00;5 minutes;Black dot in sky breaks into 4 pieces--then collapses back into a single dot.  Then disappears. We were at Best Buy (electronics store).  We just arrived in the car (parked south of the store and looking southwest)when we saw a black dot in the sky floating about 45 degrees above the horizon. The dot temporarily split into four parts for about twenty seconds and then collapsed back into a single circle. It started floating again and appeared to get smaller and smaller as though moving away (or shrinking upon itself).   Finally, as we were watching, it disappeared into the sky. Although it was late afternoon and the sun was setting, the sky was still bright.  The object definitely visible.  There were no jet trails or other characteristics.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
White roundish object moving in sky.;2016-08-06 12:15:00;2 minutes;White roundish object moving in sky. I saw an unusual round/oval shaped white object moving around the sky while I was driving.  Moving with ease and faster than a normal plane type aircraft.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Round object with roughly 15 white lights at outer edges.;2019-09-10 05:00:00;30 minutes;Round object with roughly 15 white lights at outer edges. In the southeast sky, roughly at 1/4 from directly above, there was a bright star from first appearance.  It seemed to sparkle in a diamond type of way but much brighter white than a typical star.  It was completely round, with white lights, maybe 15, on the outer edge.  There were many dinner white lights within the round object.  A blue light was spotted within the object but was not consistently there.  All other lights remained and moved only slightly.  It never moved much but moved enough to clearly see it was not a natural object.  It remained for about thirty minutes.  It dimmed toward the end of the thirty minutes and disappeared almost as though it had burned out.  My husband and sixteen year old son saw this after I woke them up to confirm that this was not a natural object in the sky.  It was completely circular with very defined white lights on the outer edges.  It was very high in the sky but not  as far away as a star might be to the human eye.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
