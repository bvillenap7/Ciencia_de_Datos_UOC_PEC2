A horse shoe shaped object with red pulsating lights appeared, hovered, and reversed its direction.;2005-11-19 16:00:00;3 minutes;A horse shoe shaped object with red pulsating lights appeared, hovered, and reversed its direction. The object was shaped like a horse shoe.  It was traveling southwest toward my location.  Around the border of the horse shoe were a series of large pulsating red lights.  They may have been flashing or lighting in a series, but the effect was such that the light seemed continous.   The object appeared to be wobbling as if it were having difficulty maintaining its attitude.  It's stopped and remained stationary for approximately 1 minute.  I estimate the altitude at about 2,000 feet.   The object then began to move backward - away from my location.   While there was no sound, the movement was such that the object appeared to have some form of propulsion - i.e., it was not floating as one might expect with a balloon.   It traveled into the distance to where I could no longer see it.  I took a picture with my cell phone, but it was too distant therefore, nothing was visible on the picture.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
3 dots of light that changed formation and speed instantly;2006-12-14 19:00:00;30 seconds;3 dots of light that changed formation and speed instantly watching the sky for meteors/ 3 dots of light flying across the sky in a vertical line formation,at first thought it was meteors but they were spread out equally apart. then they changed to a triangle formation/ thought it was an airplane until one of the dots of light swung around the outside of the other 2/ then they changed direction in an instant and seemed to fly outward until disappeared. The color was a soft/warm golden color/there was no light tail like a meteor would have. they were in the western sky over Kansas.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
((HOAX??))  I swear this black flying-saucer shaped thing should not have been flying. I predict it was going around 2 mph;2013-08-10 07:30:00;50-60 minutes;I swear this black flying-saucer shaped thing should not have been flying.   I predict it was going around 2 mph and doing summersaults for a half-hour then started spinning like a torpedo for 20-30 min.    At this point I could hardly see it at all.
