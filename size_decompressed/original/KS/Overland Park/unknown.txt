RED, YELLOW, PURPLE, BLUE, ORANGE, GREEN, PINK, WHITE, AND SILVER FLASHING OBJECT HOVERS AND RETREATS BACK OVER 55 MINUTE TIME FRAME.;2005-11-22 17:45:00;55 MINUTES;RED, YELLOW, PURPLE, BLUE, ORANGE, GREEN, PINK, WHITE, AND SILVER FLASHING OBJECT HOVERS AND RETREATS BACK OVER 55 MINUTE TIME FRAME. I was outside in my backyard and I noticed a very strange object hovering over the treelines at dusk. It was just over the treelines of the horizon. It looked to be right over the backyard. It definitely had glimmering lights that were flashing and the lights colors were red, yellow, purple, blue, orange, green, pink, and white. At the beginning of the sighting, it was still outside and no stars were visible. I determined for certain that it was not a satellite, a meteor, a blimp, a comet, etc. Because they move and this object was stationary for about 25 minutes. I thought it may be the star sirius cause I know a little about astronomy and it is the brightest star in our constellations. But when I went outside to investigate further, I saw more signs that this was silver colored. Then the most amazing thing happened. I witnessed the object very quickly move to the northwest and then several seconds later returned exactly to where it was prior.  Then a couple of minutes elapsed and it suddenly moved very quickly further from my view in a frontwards motion.  It was no longer visible, which means it cannot be a star. I moved back further about twenty-five feet and up a slight hill in my backyard. I could see the object again. I think that the object was beeing operated by intelligent forces because of the way it moved so fast and deliberately. After a couple of more minutes the object retreated a distance into the north and I could no longer see it. It was a very weird experience this happened on November 22, 2005 it was a Tuesday night at 5:45 P.M. I couldn't believe what I saw in my backyard.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Object seen over Kansas City during morning commute. Vanished 10 seconds after spotting it. Third time phenomenon observed.;2009-12-15 08:30:00;10 seconds;Object seen over Kansas City during morning commute.  Vanished 10 seconds after spotting it. Third time phenomenon observed. Saw a definite solid object in the sky just to the west of I-35 near 95th street.  It was far enough away that I couldn't distinguish any shape or features- just kinda looked like a shiny white object.  I ruled out the possibility that this was a bird and it wasn't any sort of reflection on the windshield of my car.  This was definitely some type of aerial object that was VERY visible and just suddenly vanished after 10 seconds from when I first spotted it.   While watching the object, it blinked a couple times- like if you had a dimmer switch on a light bulb and dimmed the lights partially for half a second and then turned it back up. This was the third occasion in the last couple months I have seen this phenomenon.  All three incidents occurred in the Kansas City area during my commute to work in the morning (different locations each time though).  Each time the object was very visible for about 10 seconds and then just vanished- didn't fly away, just quickly faded like a light going out.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Blue light accelerating at an extremely high rate of speed, then disappearing.;2014-04-16 21:40:00;1 second;Blue light accelerating at an extremely high rate of speed, then disappearing. At approximately 21:40, traveling east on 87th Street in Overland Park from Antioch towards Metcalf Ave.   Saw a blue light move towards the east in a straight line (in line with 87th street), accelerating at an extremely high rate of speed before disappearing.   The light appeared to be arcing up, and vanished before it was anywhere close to the horizon.   I believe it was arcing up, as it decreased in size.  The sky was free of clouds.  When it accelerated, it did so smoothly.   The color of the light was blue, but more white towards the center, and it was circular in shape. It moved to fast to be an airplane, or at least any I have ever seen in my life.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Red and green non blinking lights hovering, seen by 2 others.;2014-09-20 19:48:00;3 minutes;Red and green non blinking lights hovering, seen by 2 others. Was hovering just above the tree line then shot straight up right above me.  It had two red and green non blinking lights.  We observed it for three minutes then it slowly moved out of view.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
