A fireball bounced out of the ground.;1998-05-16 16:00:00;a few seconds;A fireball bounced out of the ground. A ball of fire jumped up off of the ground and then dissapeared. I only saw it for a few seconds, so i can't descipe it every well. All i saw was a blur of red and smoke. I was with a couple friends and they said that they had saw it too.

Green fireball with trail headed N-NW in Eastern KS - arching downward - resembled size and speed of a single discharge from a roman ca;1999-09-29 22:30:00;2-4 sec.;Green fireball with trail headed N-NW in Eastern KS - arching downward - resembled size and speed of a single discharge from a roman candle seen from a couple hundred feet. Larger and brighter than Venus. Green fireball with trail headed N-NW - arching downward - resembled size and speed of a single discharge from a roman candle seen from a couple hundred feet. Larger and brighter than Venus.  Trailed toward Earth much like a meteor.  I did not witness a change in course or speed but it did change from a brilliant green to a glowing red ember just before fading away.  No noises are associated with the siting.  My line of site was obscured by tree branches at first but it traveled Northward into a clear opening.  It appeared to cross the path of an airliner in the vicinity but the airplane seemed much farther away.  The fireball seemed to be 2-3 miles West of my position.  It was much slower, larger, brighter and more colorful than any shooting star I have ever seen.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Orange/Amber fireball that periodically flares up;2004-01-05 22:00:00;5 minutes;Orange/Amber fireball that periodically flares up I was walking out to my car when I saw what appeared to be a giant, orange/amber star pulsing on-and-off, low on the eastern horizon. It actually seemed to flare up, like a huge fireball, and then dim out again, over and over. I would say that each time it flared up, it was about the size of one of the street lights across the streets.  After about 30 seconds it dimmed into what appeared to be a small, stationary star. It was flickering between a white and orangish color at this time. After another minute or two, it slowly started moving northward and became completely white in color. I noticed lights blinking on it at an extremely rapid pace (like a police car) that were red, blue, and green in appearance. I soon lost track of it.  As I was leaving the parking lot, I noticed what appeared to be four low-flying planes flying around the area where I had seen it pulsing.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
Larger then meteor, faster then would be at such close distance sighting.;2008-07-31 23:00:00;1 second;Larger then meteor, faster then would be at such close distance sighting. looking down at grass from balcony, a flash of light as almost some one took a picture above me, I look up and see a bright light shoot down for a small section of the night sky. Very Quick very narrow light stream SE to NW direction. Did research, Metior Showers are seen from north to south trajectory around the month of August, this was traveling in the opposite direction. Also an object that size would be traveling much slower if in the burning in faze entering the earth atmosphere would of done it much further away and much slower. What i saw made a very bight light almost as an explosion to enter atmosphere or to pick up speed. was visible by the light emitted from it for a second if that and then diminish. I cant say that it was not an meteor, but from all that i have read on them, they move much slower, unless they are very close to when they are faster but no were near the size of what i saw. Any one else in the are happen to see it as well. let us know.;38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412

The fireball;2011-07-27 23:59:00;Ten seconds.;This was the second one of these I have seen in the last two or three months.  I was driving south coming from Kansas City.  The fireball like object was flying west very, very, very fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.9303324594257;-94.683363670412
One Fiery Red Orb ~Hovering~ Over Overland Park... That's twice now within 5 months!;2013-11-09 20:40:00;~5 minutes;One Fiery Red Orb ~Hovering~ Over Overland Park... That's twice now within 5 months! Observed~ One clearly red fiery orb was hovering mid-altitude for several minutes over Overland Park, KS... Once again.  ~Same location (I-35 & 435), and within an hour of the last sighting that I also posted on NUFORC (& they posted on MUFON) on 6/7/13 @ 21:30.  Last time was a cluster of ~10 red orbs, but this one on 11/9/13 was alone, smaller and hovering, not cruising.  It also dissipated after observing it...  And once again, I saw it while driving south on I-35 just past 435 and to the east (towards Olathe).  And once again, when I first saw it I kept it in sight to quickly/easily weed-out all the other green/red/white flashing lighted, winged, propped, petrol-powered noisemakers (not Element 115 propulsion system).  When this became abundantly obvious, I again pulled my car over on the shoulder of the highway with the window down for the duration... Fascinated, and thankful it happened again for me.  It once again had no other running lights (port/star! board/taillight)... It seemed to be pulsating (flame-like), too, before vanishing into thin air.  Any other known identified flying objects in our airspace would continue to be visible with their clearly seen lights... Illuminating for good reason.  We save our cloaking devices for when it's truly needed... Not crowded airspace.  -}  I almost didn't post this sighting... Merely because I didn't want anyone to think I was just seeing things repeatedly.  In fact, after the last sighting, one of my close credible friends suggested I carry a camera and watch the skies... Just in case.  I told him I've always watched the skies, but I'll never carry a camera just for that... Not obsessed with it, yet.  And, that I figured it was just a one-in-a-lifetime event.   He reminded me that they periodically frequent the same locations... I agreed.  That's two within the same year...  And it's only November.  I've noticed several other postings on here in the same area, like my last documented report.  Another guy and his friends reported the same location sighting the last time on MUFON on 6/7/13 w/ same time-frame, and that was indeed relieving to me.  So, keep your chins up^ and minds open...  Forever.  It's just a matter of time, and time will tell.  Peace out&gtâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I saw a MASSIVE white object fall from the sky.;2016-09-28 23:00:00;Seconds;I don't know if this type of sighting counts, but I wanted to get it out there!   I was driving home from work.  I got off at 10:00pm and it takes me about 30 minutes to get home.  Halfway home, between Marshall Drive and Santa Fe Trail, saw a MASSIVE white object fall from the sky.  It was incredible bright and shocked me enough to want to know if anyone else saw it.  It was also pretty huge!  The next day i mentioned it at work and a co-worker said that she had seen it headibg toward the city.  Something fell from the sky.
