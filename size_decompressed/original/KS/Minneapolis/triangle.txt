triangular craft with white lights at each point and dimmer lights in the middle.;2008-02-29 23:00:00;2 min.;triangular craft with white lights at each point and dimmer lights in the middle. While driving home from Salina, KS my radio went completely static for a about a minute (I tried several channels) and moments later I saw lights to my left (which was west) and I looked out my window and saw a craft that was triangular shaped. It had brighter white lights on each point and dimmer lights at the midpoint of each side.  It was very low to the ground, lower than any normal plane would be traveling and it made absolutely no sound. It was traveling south pretty slowly I took my eyes off of it to look back at the road to check my driving when I looked back it had disappeared.
