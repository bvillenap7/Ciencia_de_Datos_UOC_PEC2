Blue light shoots down from the sky over Wamego kansas.;2008-10-08 19:30:00;35 sec;Blue light shoots down from the sky over Wamego kansas. I seen an object from my east window shoot through the sky in a slight downward motion. It was a very bright bluish color, oval in shape  and larger than a falling star. It traveled at a very fast speed. I waited to hear a crash but it never came. I have never seen anything like it before. I am not a ufo enthusiest but this has really spiked my intrest.
