At 12:50 a.m. on 8/26/13, west of Winchester, KS on the Leavenworth/Jefferson County line I saw a bright rectangle fly from southeast to southwest.  It was the size of the moon, but the shape of a stovepipe, and it was up in the air. I observed this for approximately 8 seconds.  It caught my eye while traveling from the south, I stood up, and witnessed it fly to the Northwest.  It dimmed from a moon sized, stovepipe shape, into a small orange ball. 4 minutes later I heard a boom.  There were no cars out in the country at the time. All the dogs in the distance started barking at the noise.  I drove up the Leavenworth/Jefferson County Kansas line to see if something could have crashed. I couldn't see anything.  There was no traffic, and no cb radio traffic as well.;39.3234;-95.2743
