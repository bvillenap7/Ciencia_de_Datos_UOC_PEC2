My wife is a nurse at a hospital in Wichita,KS about 40miles north of where we live.She arrived home as normal at 3am.  She woke me up, and told me there was a plane with abnormal lights hovering above the house.  I was skeptical, but woke up anyways.  I went outside, and what I witnessed is a large object with three orange fire like lights in a triangle like position.  The object was in my opinion the size of a medium sized house.  I realized it was not an airplane nor helicoptor when it did not emit any sort of sound and just hovered silently.I live out in the country so I have no close neighbors so I was pretty frantic, so I called the police.  While I was on the phone with the 911 operator, the object I don't know how to describe it but the object shot into the sky like a slingshot leaving a orange glow for a few seconds..  When the police arrived I made a report and that's all, the officer said it was probably a meteor but it was not a meteor.  I am a well respected dentist and my wife is a well respected nurse, and we are not the kind to make up such foolish things.  I found this site and maybe by writing this somebody can tell me what this wasâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  I hope someone will inform the Harper Police Department that meteors do not hover, or hang around, for 5 minutes.  They are visible because they pass through the atmosphere at 8-50 miles per second.  PD));37.2928;-98.0149
