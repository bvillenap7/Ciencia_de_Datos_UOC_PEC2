Large triangle shaped object over Horton, KS moving east.;2003-07-05 22:00:00;7 minutes;Large triangle shaped object over Horton, KS moving east. Three of us were heading back to Atchison, Ks after a post fourth of July fireworks show at the Sac and Fox Casino. My friends car has a sunroof, so i was leaning back in the passenger side seat, looking up at the stars. This triangle shaped constellation caught my eye, because the magnitude of it was dimmer then the surrounding stars. Then i noticed something else. It started moving. One point of the triangle was pointing East, and that was the direction that this thing was moving. I was so excited that i told my friend to stop the car. She did and we got out of the car and i pointed to where the object was. It finally caught her eye and we both had chills running up our spines. My girlfriend was with us but she said that she could not see it. We were frantically trying to get her to see it, but eventually it faded as it moved further east. Whatever this thing was, it had to be huge, because based on the magnitude of the light, and the distance it would have had to have been above us, i am guessing it was in the Earths orbit (not inside the atmosphere). Seeing things like that sure makes one truly wonder.....we are not alone.;39.6774;-95.5347
