It appeared to be over the Kansas City area which is east of of where I live.  The craft moved very slow and appeared to hover for a little bit.  It slowly started to descend.  I went to stand up on my deck rail so I could see it better and it was gone.   Did anyone else see this?  And could you tell what it was? ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the object was.  PD));38.7954;-95.5608
