The object zipped across the sky.;2016-05-07 23:00:00;15 seconds;The object zipped across the sky. Small star like in size that looked like a shooting star at first moving from West to East.  We were watching the night sky and seeing the speed of shooting stars thinking this was one too. Initially spotted by one of us then seen by both.  The object moved as fast as a shooting star but once overhead began to move right then back left several times.  It moved so fast across the sky and altitude higher than airplanes that were flying by.  It was amazing.  Zigzagging, then fading away.  No sound or trail.  It looked like a star moving across the sky.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

All the sudden it started moving erratically. It made sudden moves left, right, weird circles then dropped out of site.  It then reappeared approaching MAFB from the north and made a sudden turn to the left and disappeared. In all the years of telescope observing,  I never saw anything like this.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
