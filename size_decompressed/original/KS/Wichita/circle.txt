Massive fleet of amber green spheres flying in odd formation over Wichita, Kansas.;1985-06-15 23:00:00;25 minutes;Massive fleet of amber green spheres flying in odd formation over Wichita, Kansas Well i do not remember the exact year but it was about 1985-1987 in the summer.  Me my brother and two cousins were outside in my aunts broken car.  We were just sitting and talking for about a hour.  We all decided to go inside when my brother who is actually five years older than me pointed to the sky and said Ya'll look, UFO's!!.   It was a semi-cloudy night but what we saw traveling into the clouds (sort of speak) was what looked like a fleet of spherical UFO's.  This fleet of space craft flew in complete unison in some very odd pattern (kind of like the formation of Canadian geese, but having 90 degree formations of all sorts).  We thought that we were being invaded by aliens as they flew across the sky at a slow motion with out a sound.  The spherical objects had a amber glow at the bottom. We watched what seemed to be over a 150 craft fly across the sky for about 20 minutes.   I was young then but i know that there had to be many people of Wichita, , that saw this sight, without a doubt. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A circular, well lit craft accelerated and disappeared.;2014-05-29 23:45:00;10 seconds;A circular, well lit craft accelerated and disappeared. I was looking to the east at about 20 degrees up from the horizon when I saw a circular craft that was well lit up traveling to the north.  It was close to the flight path of planes that were taking off at McConnell Air Force Base.  The object was about three miles north of the base.  The object made no sound as it accelerated to the north and then vanished.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
We all looked and saw an airplane leaving a contrail lit up by the rising sun.;2016-01-12 07:48:00;2 minutes;At 7:45 am, my dad and I were leaving our house to take my children to school. One of them points up to the sky and says &quotHey! Coo At 7:45 am, my dad and I were leaving our house to take my children to school. One of them points up to the sky and says Hey! Cool! Look at that plane!  We all looked and saw an airplane leaving a contrail lit up by the rising sun.  It was amazingly defined, you could see both lines in the contrail.  Then as my dad was driving after we pulled out of our drive, I kept watching this contrail and noticed a disturbance in part of it and pointed it out to him and that's when we both saw an orb-like white thing next to the contrail.  The disturbance I can only describe as it looked like it was almost swirling!  The orb was too big to be a star. From my perspective it looked like it was right by the contrail.  It moved in a figure 8. I noticed it looked as if one side of the contrail was straight as normal while the other made a curvy wwww-shaped line the whole length of it.  All of a sudden, the contrail started dissipating! Almost instantaneously! It was then the orb thing made a 90 degree turn and shot off so fast I lost sight of it.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Orange balls of light in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-02-15 19:00:00;1 minute each;Orange balls of light in the sky My wife and I were on the back porch and to the east a little higher than the horizon, (above rooftops of homes) a light just showed up, very bright orange in color, would stay in one place for about 30â€“45 sec or so, then would just vanish, we saw somewhere around 8-9 of them.  All within about 5 min or so.  None of them were that close, all to the east but miles between each other.  One of them showed up and moved horizontally towards the NW and went behind some roof tops, I went to the front yard to see if I could still see it but could not.  Another white one showed up much higher in the sky and dropped downward in a speed comparable to a jet and then lost a lot of glow and vanished as well, no tail end to any of them.  Just round balls of light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Two bright perfect circle orbs operating perpendicular to each other with exact movement, direction, and speed.;2018-05-29 06:00:00;5 minutes;Two bright perfect circle orbs operating perpendicular to each other with exact movement, direction, and speed. On May 29, 2018, I got up this morning as usual about 6am, for quiet time, and happened to look at the security camera.  At first I noticed a perfect little circle orb hovering around the lens, which after a while it moved up and a second circle came up, moving in the exact same format.  Thinking it was possible a reflection of the first circle, upon further observation, I realized these were two different orbs moving back and forth in perfect alignment, without changing direction.  It was as if a reflective object was moving the orbs in unison. I opened the front door and walked toward where the camera indicated the objects were. However, they disappeared off screen.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

And I'm always looking up into the sky. There was a light cloud with lighs streaking through it. It was weird light green lights.  Ran back in to get my cell phone to take pictures but they were going to fast.  Not sure what was going on behind that small cloud.  Sky was clear except that cloud.  Then to the right there was this round object.  And it was gone.  But the lights still continue behind that small cloud.  Strange.  Thought it was the northern lights. But not as big and not as bright.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
