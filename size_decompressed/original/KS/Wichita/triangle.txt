I could see no body of the craft, just the lights. It made no sound and moved from the SE to NW as fast as I could turn my head and watch. I live just north of a commercial airport and just NW of a major military airport(B-1's and KC 135 tankers). I was simply observing the stars on a relatively clear night, when out of the corner of my eye came this object with three circles glowing about the color orange of a cigarette ember. There was no sound and no visible body, but it passed overhead to the NW, at maybe 800-1000 ft. as fast as I could turn my head. I had 17 hours of solo time in a private plane when I was 16 yrs. old and have always been enthused by aircraft and the space program. I am also an amateur astronomer and just love looking at the sky at night.This is not something I imagined.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Three orange lights;1991-04-01 00:30:00;1 hour;Three orange lights northwest of my house i saw 2 red/orange lights and just assumed it as an plane or helio but it was moving so slow i dont think it was either of those. As it moved eastward it passed sum cell phone towers and i could see it was triangle shaped. It slowed to a stop then went like like a bat out of hell south then i couldn't see it anymore;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
A triangle shaped ship with three lights flew over head and changed directions without changing position;2002-05-28 00:30:00;Five Minutes;A triangle shaped ship with three lights flew over head and changed directions without changing position Info - My friend ((name deleted)) and myself were at a graduation party at a friend's house in Vally Center (Just a little North East of Wichita)  We were out by the cars talking about random stuff.  (THERE WAS NO DRINKING AT THE PARTY... EVERYONE WAS SOBER)  There was a light wind, but not too strong.  We were sitting on the hood of my car, Nick's girfriend just went inside.  We wern't looking up but we noticed something.  We got really quiet.  There was literally no sound what-so-ever.  The dogs, horses, and all other stuff was utterly quiet.  What we saw were three lights.  It came in from the north and made no sound at all.  it flew directly south... STRAIGHT SOUTH!!!  It moved extremely slow.  it made a hard right turn and it was at this time that it broke the speed it had moved at the whole time.  It moved faster, but not real fast.  We watched it go toward the horzion until we couln't tell the difference between it and the stars.  When it passed overhead, it was low enough that the lights from the garage seemed to reflect off of it.  Literally, it seemed to be only a few hundred feet off the ground.  I have to say, it made NO SOUND AT ALL.  Until it turned, it never broke speed.  In turning, it didn't actually turn.  but just changed directions.  It was unmistakably a triangle.  CLEARLY TRIANGULAR.  See, in wichita there is an Air Force Base (McConnell AFB)  Nick and I both talked about it for a while.  We both thought when it flew overhead that it was a B2 Bomber, but IT MADE NO SOUND and when it turned, we knew it wasn't a bomber. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was talking to my spouse and I looked up because I caught movement behind some rather large trees up in the sky. I do not think I would have been able to see it if the trees hadn’t broken up the shape of the object. It was like nothing I’ve ever seen before. In the movie Predator the predator creature uses some kind of stealth/cloaking technology to remain unseen, and this was very similar in the manner that it was very difficult to visually make out. I know it was not a plane because it was far to large for that, and there were very dim yet distinct lights that were just as difficult to make out on what appeared to be the outside edges of the object. The object was about the size of two football fields in width and one in length, and was shaped like a triangle. The object was rather difficult to discern, it was as though it was and was not there. The lights gave it a shape, but no distinct characteristics were evident. Because of the way it moved with the trees in my field of view in front of the object I was able to pinpoint its location and trajectory, after it passed over the trees I got a more distinct view in open clear sky. 	 At first I thought it was a hallucination or something but when it reached the clear sky I got a good look at it and I knew it was there. Our planes move through the sky and against the pressure of the gases that make up our atmosphere, as a result  you can see some difficulty in how slow they move even though you know they are moving really freaking fast. This object appeared to move effortlessly, and smoothly-like there was no resistance- and I called out to my spouse- What the hell is that- and started running toward the street to get a better look at it due to it’s movement it was going toward a blind spot to- my at that time current position. My spouse did not have an opportunity to see what I was describing because as I ran toward it, it disappeared from my field of vision- strangely enough before it entered the area that would have been the blind-spot in my field of vision.

Black triangular/stealth shaped craft, white lights on craft made V-shape, craft appeared to move slowly, hover.;2008-04-04 22:00:00;15 minutes;Black triangular/stealth shaped craft, white lights on craft made V-shape, craft appeared to move slowly, hover. Around 10:00pm while driving north on 235, I noticed a triangular pattern of white lights behind me and to the right, somewhere south of the Zoo Exit and north of Kellog/54.  It was dark outside, but the craft appeared to have a stealth like/triangle appearance with several white lights silhoutting it's shape.  The craft moved slowly and appeared to hover and descend as I watched.  I tried to turn around and go back but the craft was gone by then.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

Saw a bright tear-like triangular shape in the sky that did not move for more than 30 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter?  PD));2011-10-31 19:00:00;30+ min.;Saw a bright tear-like triangular shape in the sky that did not move for more than 30 minutes Driving east on US Highway 96 between Hutchinson and Wichita, KS, when I observed a weird looking star.  It was brighter than most stars and with the sky being overcast, for one to shine so brightly it caught my attention.  It was north of the highway.   After seeing this star I looked in other directions and noticed two others (one further east and one south).  These stars did not appear to be moving. Looking further, I observed it looked like a tear in the dark sky letting light seep through in a triangular shape.  As I was driving, the two others disappeared from my line of site, but the one to the north stayed stationary.  The star remained in site until I arrived at my home. Then I cam inside and looked for a website to report it on. I was listening to the radio and talking on my cell phone all of the way and had no interference. I had not been drinking or using illegal substances and am not overly tired.  The feelings I experienced were facination at first and then after realizing it was something unknown, I kinda got that X-File like paranoia.  I made sure I stayed with traffic and drove through popuplated areas all the way home. This is my very first reporting. ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter?  PD));37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

What's that?'   My neighbor and I look up and see a large triangular shaped formation of white pulsating lights hovering high above downtown Wichita.  About the time that we both were saying 'What the heck IS that?' it seemed to move a bit to the east.  Then its lights smeared as though it were moving very fast and then it simply vanished.

And I'm slowing down the far right light starts moving down and that whole thing forms into a ducking triangle.  (This thing has not moved either) and it starts moving south really slow like I was now trying to catch up to it.  Then all of a sudden it's a triangle with a red light and orange light and it started spinning or rotating really slowly and just cruises south!  It looked like it had wide beams pointing away from it (there were three of those) and the beams weren't bright at all just dim.  And I ducking lost it I went down a dead end road.  Just cruising south really slow.  It turned into a triangle in front of my eyes I watched it! I was shaking I was so freaked out!!!!

Low just above my roof line I saw a fast moving, dim set of lights moving east to west.   At first I thought it was just a plane.  As I am in the flight path of McConnell afb, Jabara Airport, and the Beech Aircraft factory.  Yet this made no sound.   What got me was the triangle did a complete rotation counter clock wise yet never changed direction.  Then disappeared behind a house moving west.  I have been around aircraft my whole life.   Living in Wichita, you see planes everyday.  I've never seen anything like this EVER!  The lights on the object were not bright.  (Dimmer than most visible stars)  No strobes or anything.

Triangular object glides over car while driving outside of town.;2019-01-03 21:30:00;5 minutes;Triangular object glides over car while driving outside of town. On January 3, 2019, at approximately 9:30pm, our 11 month old son was fussy, so I took him out for a car ride.  I suspected that it might take a while to get him to go to sleep and since it was a nice night, I decided to head north out of town. We live in N.E. Wichita just outside of Bel Aire.  I drove North on Oliver to 53rd St. N.  I then turned East on 53rd to Greenwich.  At Greenwich I turned South until 45th St. At 45th St I then proceeded back to the West.  At some point, as I was approaching Rock Rd. (on 45th St.), I noticed a rather large and bright light ahead of me on the horizon.  The light looked white or a white/yellow.  I thought at first it might be a light on the water tower or a radio tower in the distance.  As I continued West on 45th I realized that the water tower and its lights were not in line with this light (which seemed to be stationary).  I passed the water tower and proceeded West on 45th St and could now see the radio tower in the distance an it’s lights. The tower was North of the light in question.  The light at this time had begun to dim and didn’t seem as bright.  It was however in the same position (or so it seemed) as it was when I first noticed it (1.5 miles ago).   As I approached Oliver (sti! ll on 45th St.) the light seemed to be getting lower, as it was now becoming obstructed by trees.  At this time, my best guess was that the light was a mile or two in front of me.  As I approached Hydraulic (still on 45th St.), I stopped for a train which was crossing the road.  I believe there were 2 cars in front of me.  While waiting for the train (2 minutes) the light did not move.  If it did it may have moved toward me.  Just before the train finished passing, the light began to move toward me and to the North.   As I approached the intersection of 45th & Hydraulic I could now see 3 lights in the shape of a triangle. It crossed Hydraulic at approximately 1/4 of a mile to the North of 45th St. The front light (front as in relation to its travel E-NE) was blue in color.  The two rear lights were white or slightly whitish-yellow.  I also noticed that the lights did not blink or flash, as I expected to see a helicopter or some type of plane.  When the object passed over Hydraulic, I e! stimate that it may have been at an altitude of about 1,000 ft.  As it passed over Hydraulic I turned North to try an follow it as it was moving rather slow.  As I traveled further North on Hydraulic I started to lose sight of it out the passenger side of our van.  I approached 53rd St and turned East where I could see it ahead of me.  It seemed to begin moving at a faster rate of speed.  By the time I approached Oliver it was well off in the distance.  I would estimate that it was 10 miles away by that time. I debated whether or not to post this report for fear of some kind of misidentification on my part but after watching the air traffic in the night sky the following days I became more sure about the differences in this object and that of other aircraft.  Most aircraft I’ve seen have some kind of red light, this had none.  The altitude at which the object in question was also odd.  The aircraft I see here are in a landing pattern or take off at that altitude and this object did not fit the typical flight pattern of other aircraft from the surrounding airports.  The main difference was the 3 solid lights beneath the object.  They did not flash or blink. There was also no beacon light on this object.  I believe that at the close proximity in which I was to the object I would have seen a beacon light, however the 3 lights beneath the object were the only ones I could see.  At 45th & Hydraulic (my closest position to the object) it was moving very slow.  I also rolled the windows down a! t that point and could not hear the propellers of a plane or helicopter. Also, I do believe the vehicle stopped in front of me while waiting for the train took notice of it and tried to follow it as well.  The car turned North on Hydraulic then East on 53rd, then South on Oliver back to 45th where it then turned West again on 45th.  The drivers behavior seemed to be very distracted as if they were watching the objects flight. I hope this might encourage others in the Wichita area to consider sharing their sightings as well.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
