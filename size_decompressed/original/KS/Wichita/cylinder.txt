An airliner was heading south, away from it. I was finishing up my lunch break, heading east on Central Ave. While stopped at the light at Central (which goes east/west) and Rock Road (north/south) I spotted an object. This object appeared to be shaped more like an oil barrel, with a flashing red light on the top. An airliner was heading south, away from it. The object appeared to be hovering, but was moving southernly. It was hard to determine the distance from the object to the ground, and to the other objects (i.e. myself and the plane). Note also that at Central and Webb (the next major intersectiion going east)lies Raytheon Aircraft. This object did not appear to be a plane or a helicopter. I was also parked at this light for about three minutes along with about twenty others. I must have looked pretty strange sticking my head out of my car window looking at this thing. The road going east (Central) goes up a hill at this point. There is also a crosswalk midway between Central and Rock, and Central and Webb. This object was not a crosswalk light. While I was observng object move southernly, object passed behind trees. After the light changed, I headed east. Object had disappeared. Plane was also out of sight.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

I told my dad to turn to the right to see the object more closer.  The object was about 40 degrees from us and about 300 ft away.  Its shape was like a cylinder and was some what matalic looking. It started to move south as we got a better view.  I got the feelong it knew we saw it, we were moving parallel to the object.  My dad did not think it was a UFO. He told me its just a plane.  He decided to turn the truck back towards home and i looked back to see it one more time but the object was gone.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
