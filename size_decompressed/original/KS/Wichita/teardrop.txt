Two of us where watching a large cumulus clowd to the south of Wichita, Kansas at approximately 9PM CST when a dark ufo like object appeared.  It flew straight north at a high rate of speed, probably 100-200 mph.  It was gone in approximately one minute.  It was probably 3 feet in diameter on the top and maybe 5 feet in diameter at the bottom, this could only be seen from the side, when it was directly south of us.  When it flew over it was circular from the bottom.  It had to fly right over the Wichita airport, because we live 4 miles directly north of the airport.  It was somewhere between 200 to 300 yards above the earths surface, and did not have any noise coming from it.  It wasn't a bird, balloon or plane.  I, have a science education, geology, and have worked for Boeing and Raytheon in the past (7 years total).  We, myself and my girl friend whom works directly for another aviation company, have lived here for approximately 3 years and have seen many airplanes, and birds (the sedgwick county park is nearby and is full of ducks and geese which fly over our neighborhood daily).  Furthermore, I grew up on the farm, and have hunted and raised all kinds of birds, I', 41 years old.  What flew over tonight was definitely not a bird, or a plane or a balloon.  It was flying at a very high rate of speed, and was probably flying under radar, without sound.  I seen it first while I was laying in the pool looking at the beautiful cumulus cloud directly to the south.  As soon as I seen it, I told Susan, look a UFO, jokingly, and moments later, the joke was not a joke no more, it was a real UFO.  The first I have ever seen, and I have been looking, but have never seen any thing like this.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

The flashes were blueish green and just blinked out of exsistence.  We thought how very X-Files. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Orange teardrop-shape craft;2010-01-12 19:00:00;5 minutes;Orange teardrop-shape craft My wife and I had just gotten home from a late walk in southwest Wichita, I was pointing out constellations to her when we both saw a craft approach from the south with no indicator lights like a airplane and no audible engine noise.  It was dark orange that faded to light orange, we first thought it might be a plane on fire but it kept a constant path and speed.  The craft did a 90 degree bank to the east and faded outside the city limits.  I was reluctant to report it until I saw the other report made.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
