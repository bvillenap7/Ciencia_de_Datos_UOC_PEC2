Glowing Green SKY MIR;2001-02-15 00:05:00;1MINUTE;Glowing Green SKY MIR I was working second shift at a hospital, I live in the country, so we have a terrific veiw of the sky, I thought I heard something and suddenly the entire sky was glowing bright green, not just a part of the horizon but it was like daylight but bright green, I am not sure of the exact date but it was cold outside and I remember the MIR was supposed to come down soon, at first being the age I am I thought it was a nuclear bomb in the atmosphere, and after I calmed down I thought maybe the MIR fell sooner than planned. I called MCconnel AFB the guard I spoke to had seen it but had no idea what it was. I met someone at our local mall years later who also had seen it but had no information. I also called our local tv station and cosmosphere, very few people saw it and it didn't seem like a big deal to them. I emailed coast to coast but no response there either, For such a weird event with multiple witnesses there is very little documentation. Anyone in this area outside at that time had to see it.

Flashing light keeps pace with commercial aircraft going dark and light again like a sparkler or roman candle.;2003-01-08 20:30:00;15 minutes;Flashing light keeps pace with commercial aircraft going dark and light again like a sparkler or roman candle. Around 8:30 P.M., I was flying a commercial propjet from Dallas to Wichita, Kansas when I noticed a flashing of light to the port side.  The light was far enough behind the wing that I doubt the cabin crew saw it.  We were flying at 18,000 feet.  The flashing light paced our aircraft in steady northward direction.  I can only describe the flashing as what the tail of a sparkler looks like or a roman candle.  I noticed that the flashing would illuminate trees, so it was that close to the ground.  It appeared that the light was traveling through trees occasionally.  The light would flare-up and then it would go dark for 1-5 seconds and then appear again.  The flashing light would only occurred in dark spots on the ground as if it was intentionally bypassing areas of man-made illumination.  I turned asked a fellow passenger behing me if he saw the light and he replied in the affirmative.  When the flashing light reached the south side of Wichita it then turned to the west and I lost sight of it.  It appeared that the light deliberately avoided flying into Wichita.  I did not see an object, only the flashing light.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

My dad was smoking and he called me outside and said hurry.  When I went outside, he showed me this flashing light in sky and it was flashing to much and bright to be a star and we focused in it and it was moving around fast and slow.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
