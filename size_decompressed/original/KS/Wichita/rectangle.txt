I am 70 years old so at my age I cannot sleep through the night. I went to the stool room of the bathroom and while there I looked out the window and saw an object that was not familiar to me.  It was an object that was about the size of our refuse container.  It was about four feet high and four feet wide.  It was black in color.  It was sitting on my neighbor’s driveway in the sidewalk portion in the drive.  The direction from me to the object was north/northeast.  It had a white light on the side near the top – the size of it was one inch by five inches.  It pulsed every two seconds but did not go completely out during the low side of the light.  The object was about 80 -100 feet from my position.  The unusual thing about the object was there were no definitive edges.  The house, driveway, lawn and street looked as normal.  The black object looked as if it shimmered slightly.  It was black but not a dark solid black with lighter streaks going through it horizontally though they were faint.  The only other thing that was not normal was that my ne! ighbor had installed Christmas lights on the lawn next to the driveway.  The lights were not on at that time. I went back to the window two more times – the second time I went back to the bedroom then back to the window.  The third time I went into the bathroom and then back to the window.  This was a Saturday night and we had stayed home -- I did not have an alcoholic drink that night nor have I ever in my life used any kind of recreational drugs. The amount of time I observed the object was about five minutes.  After this I went back to bed and told my wife about it the next morning.  At that time it did not concern me but the next night I was a bit “spooked” by it though nothing else was sighted. The next afternoon my wife and I went across the street to my neighbor’s driveway to see there were any kind of marks that might have been left on the concrete there was nothing  About thirty years ago I noticed a white light that followed me and didn’t have any idea what it was.  This white light followed me for about sixty miles while driving in central Kansas.  This black object was so much closer and seemed so much more real.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Low in sky, rectangle craft, grey, red lights on back, 2 small wings underneath, sounded like a plane taking off.;2014-10-15 22:15:00;Flew Over;Low in sky, rectangle craft, grey, red lights on back, 2 small wings underneath, sounded like a plane taking off. Walking up to my house when what sounded at first like a low plane but when I turned around it was really low in the sky shaped like a rectangle with no wings on the side but 2 underneath it with almost like red car lights on the back.  Grey color.  Flying over the house going north.   I ran back to the driveway to get a better look and instead of flying up like a plane would taking off it went down instead behind the roof no longer in view. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume an evening sighting, and have changed the time, to reflect that suspicion.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information, so we are unable to contact her.  PD));37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
