4 fireballs streak across WIchita Ks July 4th 2010;2010-07-04 21:40:00;5 min.;4 fireballs streak across WIchita Ks July 4th 2010 July 4, 2010 Wichita, KS.  It was July 4th and my wife and I wanted to watch the fireworks. It was getting dark, but it was still light. I got the ladder out so we could get on the roof and watch the neighbors shoot off fireworks. After my wife and I got on the roof, we both saw a fireball streak across the sky, from the south heading what looked to be due north.  There where clouds also that night. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed.  The fireball was bright orangish and was directly to the west of us. We could see it as it passed in and out of the low clouds, reminded me of the flame coming off a missle. But, I didn't think it was.  A few minutes later we saw another one.  Same type direction and so forth.  The Fourth one though, came out of the south and flew directly over head at which point I could no longer see it for the clouds. I had gotten a real good view of it. It was just a fire football shaped traveling very rapidly.  Jets fly over all the time but it was going at a much faster rate.  And it seemed to be heading North by Northwest.  It didnt leave trail of any sort and it wasn't any sort of fireworks.  I am in my 40's. I honestly dont know what it could be.  I am submitting this upon the request, of the UFO REPORTING AGENCY asked that anyone who saw anything to send in your report.  All four fireballs were flying low. The one I saw directly above me was about less than a thousand feet in the air. I had been wondering what it was we saw.  But hadn't heard anything until today, about it.   Hope this information is of some help.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
