Formation of  18 to 20 bright objects leaving contrails in Wichita Kansas;2001-12-01 22:20:00;3 Minutes;Formation of  18 to 20 bright objects leaving contrails in Wichita Kansas An entire formation (18 to 20 objects) of very hot streaking objects moved accross the sky fron our location moving from southwest to northeast.  The formation was led by two very bright lights leaving streakish orange/yellow contrails.  The balance of the objects (each leaving an orange very long very bright contrail) followed.  The only description I can thing of to descrinbe the formation was like an almost dry paint brush run accross a wall. The number of objects tended to decrease as they proceded northeast from this location in Southwest Wichita Kansas. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the correct date of the incident is 01DE01.  We have amended the date here.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs. (Mountain) on Saturday, December 01, 2001.

White dim lights in formation similar to constallation.;2002-07-25 00:37:00;30 seconds;White dim lights in formation similar to constallation. On the westside of Wichita I observed what I believed to be a small formation of stars.  These stars/lights were very similar to the shape of a constalation.  I noticed, however, that these lights were very close to one another not spaced out at all.  The lights were white and slightly dim, like dimmer stars, and could see about 8-10 of them.  I kept staring at the object(s). It was static and did not move for a moment.  I looked at the clock and noted that it was 12:37.  Then the object(s) started to glide slowly to the ground.  I told the driver to start driving faster because the ojects view was lost behind some trees.  As we followed it, it looked as if though either the oject was rotating from left to right or as if the light formations were moving.  I noticed at this point that it seemed a little darker than the sky. I call it an object because the lights seemed to be in sync with each other. as it slowly descended, it quickly disappeared.  And then as soon as I couldn't see it anymore, I thought to myself  I want to see it again  instantly, there was a line of light overhead that was white and very thin.  similar to a shooting star, but instead just a line not a streak.  we had pulled off of the road at this point.. we waited but it didn't return.  I did not hear any sounds or feel any strange sensations.. we both dismissed this as some sort of military base test.  I have never seen anything like this before in real life.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
2 formations of 5 lights and 3 lights E and S of Wichita, KS same night within 10 min.;2007-10-15 21:45:00;10 min;2 formations of 5 lights and 3 lights E and S of Wichita, KS same night within 10 min. While traveling home about 30 min after sunset saw five lights appear E of Wichita, KS.  These objects were high enough above the horizon that I could see them but not high in the sky from my vantage point which leads me to believe these objects were a good distance away from where I observed them.  If an aircraft were to drop a flare right above you it would seem high in the sky, but if you were 10-20 miles away the flares would seem low on the horizon because of the distance which is how I could describe it.  These lights to me didn't seem like flares because they did not appeare one after the other. When they appeared it was almost like a formation of fighters that lit there after burners all at the same time only from the distance between the lights and myself it would not be redish white but more like a star.  These objects remained in the sky for about 3 min and then all disappeared like they appeared.   When I got home I noticed three lights in the same formation as the first formation only these light were due south of town.  They remained in the sky for only a minute and then disapeared as suddenly as they appeared. I am into weather and aviation.  I live and was raised in the air capital of the world and we have both an airport and military airbase here in wichita.   Being that my eyes are always in the sky I know aircraft lights and these were not that.  Dont want to say that they werent aircraft but then again have never observed a formation of redish white lights as bright as a flare like that in my life.

About 25 bright red lights west of Wichita;2012-01-25 20:30:00;20 minutes;About 25 bright red lights west of Wichita Wichita, KS. I stepped out of my house about 8:30pm.   I looked west and saw about 25 bright red lights far off in the sky.  The looked like very bright red stars.   I thought they might be planes or helicopters but there was too many flying too close together.   I noticed that a few of them dimmed till they were not visible so I knew they were not planes since planes do not turn their lights off.   I went inside to get my girlfriend and came out a few minutes later.  There was about 15 lights left by then.   She had no idea what the lights could be.  They were all gradually heading south, some moving faster than others.  I looked down my street and saw several neighbors standing outside all staring at these lights.   After about 15 minutes, it dawned on my to try a picture with my phone.  There was about 4 or 5 lights left by then.   These lights do appear in the picture, though one still can't make out what they are.   I do not understand why this didn't make the local news that night.  I saw a lot of people staring at these lights on my street alone.  There must have been hundreds of people who saw these. ((NUFORC Note:  It didn't make the news, I suspect, because probably none of the witnesses reported it to the news.  PD));37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Three bright lights moving like a snake across the sky.;2014-06-12 21:30:00;20 seconds;three bright lights moving like a snake across the sky. I am a pilot living in a suburb of Wichita.  My home has a view of both the aircraft on arrival to the Air Force Base as well as Jabarra airport.  I am used to seeing planes at night.  What I saw I cannot explain as an aircraft.  I saw three bright, green and red lights evenly spaced move from a standstill west to east across the horizon.   When they moved however it was as if they followed a sinusoidal wave like a snake moving through the sky.  The sine wave was slow but the movement of the three lights as a group was very fast and with no sound.   The lights disappeared from my view behind a house, presumably.

Black formation that gyrated into different S shapes.;2020-11-13 17:03:00;3 minutes;Black formation that gyrated into different S shapes. I was out walking my dogs when I saw a black formation moving to the east.  I first thought it was a formation of geese flying but as it got closer I realized it was some kind of object. It was silent and seemed to gyrate into different S shaped formations. It then started moving to the northwest. I saw one of my neighbors sitting on her porch, I asked her to please look at it so I would have a witness. Unfortunately, I did not have my cell phone with me.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
