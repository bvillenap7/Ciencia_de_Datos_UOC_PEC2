While driving observed 3 parallel bright red lights lighting in turn from left to right. These covered sizable area of night sky. Small;1996-10-20 18:20:00;15 Minutes;While driving observed 3 parallel bright red lights lighting in turn from left to right. These covered sizable area of night sky. Smaller red lights came out of one end of lights then disappeared. Soon after I witnessed white, clustered, oscillating lights and a separate set of multi-colored lights that formed a line parallel to the horizon. This line sank out of view, but the white, oscillating lights continued to sparkle and dissipate once every 5-10 seconds for approximately 30 seconds.  I continued monitoring sky but saw nothing else.  There were numerous reports of strange lights in the sky that night, from Winfield to Wichita. At approximately 6:20 P.M. on October 30th, 1996 , I was driving east on 47th St. South out of Wichita Kansas.  When I got to about 2 miles west of Rose Hill Rd. I noticed 3 bright red lights, east-south-east, about 30 degrees up from the horizon.  They were lighting up, one at a time from right to left.  They formed a parallel line to the horizon and covered a sizable section of the night sky.  They lit up from right to left 5 to 6 times which took about 25 seconds.  I then noticed smaller, what appeared to be sparkling red lights just to the right of the furthest southern light.  They spread out and dissipated quickly.  The bright lights made one more sweep from right to left and then stopped.  I continued monitoring that section of sky as I headed east but the lights did not return. Ten minutes later I arrived home, 5 miles straight east of Rose Hill.  I got out of my car and then noticed very bright white lights straight east.  They appeared to be in a tight cluster and were oscillating.  As I watched they broke apart and dissipated.  I then noticed a multi-colored line of lights parallel to the horizon.  They were approxiamelty 10 degrees above the horizon and slowly sank.  They then disappeared.  About 2 seconds later I observed more bright white, clusterered lights that were above where the multi-colored line appeared at maybe 15 degrees above the horizon.  These disappeared only to light up again after about 5 seconds.  They appeared to sparkle for a few seconds and then die down.  After another 5-10 seconds the white lights returned for another few seconds and died down as they had done the first time.  I waited 15-20 seconds then ran into my house to find another witness.  When we returned, we monitored the sky for 10-15 minutes but saw no more lights.  We did, however. see approximately 5-10 airplane lights flying in the area that I had seen the lights.  I did not see these lights during the occurance. I called the Rose Hill police but they said they had no other reports of lights in the sky.  The local nightly news ran a story about strange lights being reported by residents of Winfield Kansas that night, so I called the Winfield police.  They said that there had been numerous reports of lights but that they had no explanation.  There was also a small article about the incident in the Wichita Eagle newspaper the following day.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Another report of the 3 flashing lights in the sky Halloween '96;1996-10-31 22:00:00;~5 minutes;Another report of the 3 flashing lights in the sky Halloween '96 I've seen another description of this event and just wanted to add my memory into it to confirm. The other entry has it dated 10/30/1996 however I was a young kid Trick-Or-Treating at the time and I'm nearly positive it was the night of Halloween 1996. As a large group of family were walking down the street trick-or-treating we spotted 3 stationary lights in the sky. The lights were seen through cloud cover so no actual object was seen, and I can't be sure if the lights belonged to one object or multiple objects. The 3 lights were flashing in sequence, however I can't remember in which direction. The other report states it was right to left, but I honestly can't remember that detail. The next day we heard on the news that many others had seen the lights and there was no explanation for them.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Before you read this you should think. Do you beleive?;1997-05-27 23:30:00;10 minutes;Before you read this you should think. Do you beleive? It was a hot summer nigh in June. My father set a camera pointing towards the sky because we saw an object moving very slowly and silently sailing across the sky through the sky. We sat,starring at the small ball of light in the sky. Right now you migh be thinking that it was just a sattelite or my mind was playing a trick on me,at first i thought it was a sattelite but not my imagination because that's just saying you can't trust your own mind. Anyway something happened and I knew it wasn't a sattelite because it very quickly zipped through the sky making 90 degree angle turns then it shot off through the sky out of sight. we brought the tape inside and axamined it many times,studying it's movements. So now i'll let you think what you want to but back to the imaginatoin thing if you think that when you see something that it,s not realy there ad you can't trust your mind in knowing it's there then how do you know anything?

Lights hanging in sky northeast of home;1997-08-06 05:55:00;15-30 seconds;Summary : Lights hanging in sky northeast of home Leaving house for work and looked up into the sky.  Saw lights hanging in sky. 2 rows of dim lights parallel to each other (not blinking or flashing)and @ 3-4 second intervals, brighter lights tracked from right to left between the two rows of dimmer lights.  I was unable to see any structure either above or below the lights.  The morning sky was dark.  This object did not move or make any sound.  I decided to alter my route to work slightly to get a better look at the object and as soon as I had gotten into my car and backed out of the driveway and looked over my shoulder the object had vanished. There is an air force base in the southeast part of the city as well as a commercial airport to the west.  I often see and hear aircraft near my home, sometimes some pretty sofisticated types, like the wing.  But, the behavior of this object was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

I noticed several commercial airliners in the sky. In front of one there was a star-like object. I'm 30 years old. I just stepped out the front door of my house and looked up to notice a blue sky. The sun hadn't set completely yet and the stars had not come out. I also noticed that there were several commercial airliners in the sky with trails. All of sudden, I noticed what looked like a star in front of an airliner. This however was not a star. It moved just as fast as the airliner. It did not have a trail and it was so high it did not make a sound. At first I thought it might be nothing, but then it started to move faster. It increased in speed then vanished. Just faded. That was it.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

I was standing in my front yard, facing South, looking almost straight up (Approx. 80 degrees). It was a clear night, no clouds, just beginning to see the first stars, and there were definitely no aircraft in the area. Suddenly a light appeared, and got brighter and brighter, until it was as bright as the planet Venus. Then it started to fade away, and then was gone. There was no movement of the object (or event). No sound either (sonic booms, etc.) and it did not look like a meteor, as it was stationary. I watched the sky in that area for several more minutes, but saw nothing further. If it had been something that was burning up in the atmosphere, I would think I would have seen some movement. Could have been a supernova for all I know. Right where I was looking, a light appeared. Stars were just;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
I observed a very high-flying light that in no way resembled an aircraft, satellite, weather balloon or other eaxily explaine phenomena;2000-09-29 05:35:00;Approx. 5 min.;I observed a very high-flying light that in no way resembled an aircraft, satellite, weather balloon or other eaxily explaine phenomena At approximately 5:35 a.m. on Friday, September 29, I spotted what I thought was a satellite in the sky about 80 to 90 degrees above the western horizon.  The light, which was only slightly dimmer than one of the stars in the Belt of Orion, at first was traveling very fast in a straight line toward the north.  It then abruptly turned westerly, then northerly, then westerly again and continued these erratic manoeuvers.  After watching the light for a minute or two, I went inside and asked my wife to view the light.  Although the sky was clear, after about five minutes of watchint the light, it faded from view, then reappeared and, and finally disppeared altogether, not to be seen again. Having spent many years as a journalist, I have observed many different types of phenomena, both natural and man-made.  Because of the apparent altitude of this light, its movement, its speed and its lack of any characteristics common to an aircraft or weather balloon (there were no anti-collision lights, for example, and its speed was much to great), I find it hard to believe it can easily be explained.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

Red light dropping balls of light.;2012-01-04 22:30:00;15 min.;Red light dropping balls of light. On Jan. 5,  2012, at around 10:30pm, I saw a red object in the horizon (S.E.).  It was the size of a star but I could tell it was  move toward me so I watch it and as it drew closer, it began to drop things that appeared to be burning.  The falling objects fell and then disappeared.  Then, the object itself disappeared.   I went in the house and told my kids what I had seen.  Then, I went back out to see if I could see it again.  I didn't see it, but I did see another one exactly like it coming from the same direction and following the same path.   So I went in and got my coat and told the kids, Here comes another one!  My daughter came out and watch it with me.  This one came much closer, almost directly over my house and was dropping balls of light 5 or 6 times.  Then, suddenly, it seemed to separate into several small objects and disappeared.  I would say the siting last approximately 15 min.   I called 911 and the police came out and said someone else had also seen it.   I don't know what it was, but I know it wasn't a plane of helicopter.  It didn't blink or make any noise that I could hear.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

It is night time so I couldn't really see the shape but it had five blinking lights  two red and two white and one blue in the middle I am guessing it was diamond shaped considering on how the lights were blinking. It was too high and moved too fast to be a helicopter or airplane.  It started from one side of the sky and moved to the other side within 3 minutes I am guessing.  I even had my mother come outside to look at it also and she agrees that it couldn't possibly be and airplane or helicopter either.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

Very fast, high altitude light traveling from the west to the east.;2013-11-26 06:15:00;~2 seconds;Very fast, high altitude light traveling from the west to the east. Tuesday morning, Nov. 26, 2013, at approximately 06:15 central standard time, I was waiting for the van to warm up.  I observed a light to the south, at a very high altitude moving across the morning sky from west to east.  I would estimate the altitude at somewhere around 90,000 to 100,000 feet and possibly following interstate 40 over Oklahoma City, Okla.  I would estimate the speed to be around Mach 20.  It took approximately 120 seconds for the object to traverse from the west to the east. The object traversed across the sky faster than the space stations, which I have watched from 11,000 feet in the San Christie Mountains at Philmont Scout Ranch.  But a whole lot slower than a streaking meteorite, with no contrail visible.   It appeared to me as if the sun was reflecting off the bottom of an aircraft.  Although there were no white or red strobe lights that was visible.  I feel that this could have been the experimental aircraft, Falcon HTV-2.  I am not sure what it was, but it was fast.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Bright white lights moving around south west Wichita just above cloud cover.;2014-01-18 00:10:00;90 minutes;Bright white lights moving around south west Wichita just above cloud cover.

I went out to see for myself after she told me what was going on and sure enough I saw them to.  It was unmistakeable. As i'm filing this report at 1:30 am there is still one bright light hovering around over 235 and west st.  It's just above the cloud cover but is so bright it remains visible even when clouds pass under it.  We live by Mid Continent so i see planes take off and land all the time at night so I'm positive these are not any kind of aircraft I have seen before.  They moved around and stopped regularly.  Looked like bright white stars but it became obvious that these were not stars when they started to move.  There were no planes in the sky at all at the time I witnessed these lights.  I have always been a skeptic but this was easily convincing.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

Meteor type object that made a 180 degree change in direction at amazing speed.;2014-10-16 22:30:00;1 minute;Meteor type object that made a 180 degree change in direction at amazing speed. My fiancé and I were sitting in the back yard facing West near Kellogg and Ridge Rd enjoying the evening and a fire I had lit in our fire pit.  We were layer back in zero gravity chairs watching the fire and looking up towards the sky.  I noticed what seemed to be a falling star and got her attention to look up at it.  As it moved from the North kind of in a South-West Direction it got brighter as a normal meteor would when it breaches the earths atmosphere.  It was moving at an incredible rate of speed as most meteors do.  Out of nowhere, the object did a complete 180 degree turn and started heading in a due North direction.  When I saw this I yelled at my fiancé who was also watching it.  I was excited and started explaining that meteors don't just change direction.  I don't think she quite grasped how important and significant this was.  I continued to watch it and it bobbled in the sky (like a line on a heart monitor would blip downward) but still mainta! ined the same speed.  I lost it behind a tree and never regained sight of it again.  I work as a supervisor in the aircraft industry and have even worked on military aircraft.  This was not a plane.  I am not saying it is alien in origin, but nothing I have ever seen moves that fast and changes direction as quickly as this did.  If I had to venture a guess I would say it is possible it is some sort of military project not yet brought to light, but honestly I am dumb-founded by it.  I told my lifelong friends, and they just kind of snickered.  I am not the type of person who would make up stories.  I know what I saw.  Until last night I never really payed to much interest in these sorts of things, but I would love to find an answer as to what it was.  I will continue to watch the sky at night.

Last night, I opened my window, and looked up and saw this very bright light. It would flicker brightly for a few seconds and then dim down a bit.  When it stopped flickering, it would move about a cm or two (if you were to hold out a ruler in front of you) to the left and right, as if it were weaving back and forth. After that it would move about 6 cm to the right and then stay stationary again for a few mins, and it would repeat this motion until it moved far enough away to where it wasn't see-able anymore.

Two fast moving lights in the night sky.;2015-12-14 21:00:00;2 seconds;two fast moving lights in the night sky Briefly saw two lights while looking from my yard in west Wichita, very rapidly moving eastward in what appeared to be a coordinated, curving, no-equidistant formation.  Much faster than known aircraft and did not fit things like meteors or laser pointers.  The two lights left my field of view when they passed a local tree line.  The sighting was only for a couple of seconds.   I am a professional pilot and was a little fatigued at the time.  However, if it was only a fatigue-induced hallucination, it is odd the lights vanished at the tree line.   I really do not know what I saw, but wanted to share.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Baffling Green Orb In the Skies Of Wichita Kansas;2016-10-31 19:03:00;1 minutes;Baffling Green Orb In the Skies Of Wichita Kansas On Halloween night (31 OCT 16), at approximately 17:03, while trick or treating with my son, my wife, and myself witnessed a green object flying in the sky in the city of Wichita, Kansas.   Initially I thought this was a joke, a balloon, or drone, but the more I looked at it, I realized I was looking at an event I still cannot explain.  I am ex-military, aviation, meteorology, and astronomy are hobbies of mine.  I posses a science degree, and this was an exceptionally bizarre sighting.   Light appeared to be in the shape of an Asian paper lantern, but cropped at the top and bottom, was lime green and was internally lit.  Object was completely silent, and due to overcast, could not  have been more than 500 feet in altitude maximum.   Object was lit in a manner that I have never seen, it was not a LED, or filament bulb.  No light rays extended from the object.   Object did not deviate in altitude and flew very level, and crossed from South to North, where it became obscured by trees in my line of sight.   I asked my son who was in a slightly differing position, where it went, he said it continued in a straight line for a about another second, and curved upward at an accelerated rate of speed and disappeared in the cloud cover.   Again, I cannot explain what I saw, and can honestly state that this was not a drone, or weather related phenomena, and I have never seen a light source of this type.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

We are going north on Broadway (Aka Old Route 81) in south Wichita, KS.  My dad points to the northeastern sky and asks, Hey, is that a star?  Since the sun has already broken over the horizon and the sky is blue, I figured it was a plane far off in the distance with the sun glinting off it and told him that.

We saw what appeared to be a shooting star moving diagonally.  Which was strange, because it was slower than other shooting stars I had seen previously, and moving in a diagonal fashion.  Then it stopped, and just hovered, so I thought maybe it was an airplane... but it didn't move closer, it just stayed right there on the horizon.  I wanted to watch it longer, but we had to move on.  I kept looking back to see if it had moved, but it was still there on the horizon.  Once we parked, I looked again, and it was gone.  All I know, is that it was not a shooting star - maybe it was a satellite, but it most definitely was not an airplane.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

I attempted to get my phone out to take a picture but wasn’t quick enough.
