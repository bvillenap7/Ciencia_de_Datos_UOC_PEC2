At first I thought that it was a bird catching the reflection off of the stadium lights from the nearby college. As I watched more intently I noticed lights on the bottom of the object that appeared to merge from one color to the next. The object was diamond shaped and moved rapidly in several directions. The movement was dramatically faster than anything that I have seen in my military experience recently in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The object was changing direction in a short period of time and then shot straight up in the air and disapeared. My wife was freeked out when I told her. It is now 21:23 so this happend just moments ago. I only wish that I had a camera.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Quiet slow moving craft with red , blue and orange lights that dissapeared in the night sky;2010-07-31 00:00:00;5 minutes;Quiet slow moving craft with red, blue and orange lights that dissapeared in the night sky It was difficult to really tell the shape as it had gone past when we saw it. It was moving west at a very slow speed for any type of craft except a plane approaching landing.  There were what appeared to be red, blue and orange lights toward the front that were glowing steadily.  After this thing went about a mile past us the lights went out and you could no longer see it.  About three minutes passed and there it was again going overhead to the west and again after a few minutes the lights went out again.  A second craft maybe?  Strangest thing I have ever seen on a clear night with a nearly full moon to boot.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Bright white star like with alternating red and green light in center.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars??  PD));2016-06-10 00:20:00;continuing;Bright white star like with alternating red and green light in center. My husband and I are in the Kellogg and Hillside area.  We went to let our dog out and sit and smoke a cigarette.   My husband was looking at a large elm tree, when he noticed straight south and to the east 3 bright stars and then all of a sudden to the straight west a star, like a Christmas ornament, or 4 points like a diamond shaped, bright light moving, but super slow.  It then had red and green lights that would alternate slowly.   He said “what is that!  Look at that!”  I looked in the direction and saw it also.  It would move so slowly that you had to get a fix by another focal point.   The lights would change color from red to green in the center of the object.  It would literally hover in place for several minutes and then slowly move to the west of the 3 bright stars.  We could not figure what could hover for several minutes at a time.   We tried to take pictures with our cell phone, you can see when it looks like a regular star, and then changes from red to green, but it is so far it came out much smaller than what we saw.  We came in to see if any other reports had been made. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars??  PD));37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
