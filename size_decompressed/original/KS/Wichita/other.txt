Strange, unlit object on a low, straight path over city.;2000-07-15 21:30:00;2 minutes;Strange, unlit object on a low, straight path over city. The object was spherical in the middle, with wing-like shapes coming out of the top and bottom.  It was traveling in a north-northeast direction.  No lights whatsoever on it, which was the odd part.  Sighting was right at dusk, so the object could be seen against a darkening sky.  Low to the ground, maybe 300-500 feet, depending on distance away, which was very hard to judge.  Probably less than a mile away.  No sound. My wife and I tracked the object as it went in a straight line, for about 2 minutes until it went too far away.  Definitely not an airplane.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

L;2000-10-13 18:30:00;1:30;Did not see a craft, just a bursting brilliant meteor shower, several chunks of debris came from it.  This was a natural phenomenon.  Lasted a long time.  Suspect large object bounced off the uppermost atmosphere, as it NEVER hit the ground, only traveled across the sky, going from a south westerly direction to the north east. Left a noticeable vapor trail, with vapor spots, where the pieces finally burned up and fizzled. It stayed bright, and towards the north it began to glow dimmer, finally going out.  The object did not seem to fall, only seemed to cross the sky.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

I usually observe aircraft passing from East to West along a designated flight path. Today, as I was rounding the corner near McConnel, I saw a very bright light moving from South to North. I thought that the aircraft I had been observing (which was now behind some trees) had turned on final for the AFB. I was thinking how bright the light was and that I had never seen landing lights that bright. I had to take my eyes off of it to make the turn on the road. Then, I looked South again to watch it, but it had moved beyond where I originally saw it.. Looking out the North-West side of my window I observed the fireball travelling North. A green shielding haze was on the front of the fireball. So, I really think it could have been a satellite reentering or a comet.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
a star was moving fast, but not too fast in a telescope.;2003-05-22 22:35:00;10 sec;a star was moving fast, but not too fast in a telescope. I was stargazing with a telescope and one of the stars was moving diagonally.  The tripod was free and I tracked the object till it left the horizon.  its speed was very fast.  I could just barely keep it in the viewfinder, but both my girlfriend and I saw it.  I have seen satelites before and this was MUCH faster than one of them and this was far slower than a meteorite.  There were several witnesses with me and the object was not visible to the naked eye.  In the telescope the object's size and magnitude was that of a +4 star.  Again, I tracked the object in the viewfinder and my girlfriend just saw it for about a second, and it moved in a northern direction;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Stars appear to move.;2003-08-22 21:30:00;watched about 1/2 hr;Stars appear to move. I have never seen anything like the sightings most of your correspondents report I'm submitting this on the advice of a friend who has had sightings.  I was taking my dog into my back yard on the leash.  I felt a slight surge of energy & looked up, there was what appeared to be a star overhead.  As I stood looking at it, it appeared to move.  I figured it was actually I who moved, so found a place to lie down.  The star continued to move, back & forth & up & down, in what appeared to me to be a random manner.  I watched for awhile, then went in for the night.  I've been watching for the past several nights, & gradually become aware of more moving stars.  I sometimes have sensations in peripheral vision like small bursts of light, or meteors/falling stars, but this never happens when I'm looking directly at the area where these occur.  On one occasion, I was watching the star closest to overhead, when I noticed another light with peripheral vision that had not been there before.  Unlike the lights I'd been watching, this one moved in a straight line, & I assumed it was a plane, but it suddenly disappeared.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

Power outages darken west Wichita and points west on the morning of January 8, 2008;2008-01-08 00:00:00;morning;Power outages darken west Wichita and points west on the morning of January 8, 2008 The Wichita Eagle - Power outages darken west Wichita and points west  More than 14,000 Westar customers lost electricity in Wichita on January 8, 2008. Goddard and other towns west of the city this morning because of what Westar officials are calling a transmission event at the utility's substation in west Wichita.  We don't know for sure exactly what happened, Westar spokeswoman Erin La Row said Tuesday morning. Reports of multiple transformers blowing at Westar's substation at 226 N. Hoover may not be accurate, La Row said. It's been described as a 'transmission event,'  she said, though she could not provide more details yet. Widespread power outages were reported west of Ridge Road in Wichita, as well as in Goddard, Garden Plain, Cheney and Pretty Prairie, she said.  The outages are affecting homes, businesses and schools, officials say. At least four schools in USD 259 lost electricity and went to backup generators, district spokeswoman Susan Arensman said: Peterson Elementary, 9710 W. Central Wilbur Middle School, 340 N. Tyler McCollom Elementary, 1201 Waddington and Levy Special Education Center, 400 N. Woodchuck.  We might have more schools lose electricity as the morning progresses, Arensman said. This thing is obviously changing as we go.  Pretty much all of the traffic lights in northwest Wichita are not working as a result of the outage, a Sedgwick County dispatch supervisor reported. But traffic appears to be flowing smoothly despite the outages, Patrol West Bureau Sgt. Guy Schroeder said. Police have been sent to high-traffic intersections, he said, but no problems have been reported.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

PD));2009-08-15 22:00:00;all night;I photograph light balls and objects in sky every night and increasing lately. I have been taking pictures of sunsets every night and I keep finding that I have unexplained objects in the sky in my pictures.  I have hundreds now with red, blue, green, yellow, orange, grey, really all colors of light balls in then and in many different shapes. Some of them appear like an orb but they all seem to have a black hole in them. Some then are single, some grouped in 2 or more.  On some of the objects you can see a precise ring of lights.  There is no question looking at my pictures what I am getting in the sky every night.  Last night I started seeing them as the flash went off.  They were in my face and all around me.  They seem to come out in thunderstorms, like they like the weather. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably celestial bodies, we suspect.  PD));37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

Was boomarang shaped, Lights did not flash or change color. This moved south and was fast.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Boomer rang Objects!;2012-11-15 23:05:00;35 seconds;Boomer rang Objects! Saw two boomerrang object fling over the top of me and the only sound made was a swish Sound.  The first one was already pass me, I thought it was a flock of geese then about three mins later the second one right over the top of me.   If I had to guess the size you could put four of the Air Force refuelers side by side and that's how wide it was.  It was translucent so when it went over the stars it would blur them out of focus then back into focus.  I didn't report this because I didn't know if anyone would believe me.  But it was real to me!   P.S they both were traveling north, no turning or anything the only way I know this is because I was using military night vision googles to see them.

It happened a couple of years ago, but I still remember what happened.  I am 16 years old now.   It happened when I was around the age of 13.  I’m not exactly sure how old I was.   Me my dad and my little brother had heard there was going to be a meteor shower on this particular night.  So we set are alarms for around 1:00 am in the morning because the people on the news had said that 1:00am was when we could see the most meteors.   At the time we lived in a semi-rural area.  We lived in a cul-de-sac of about 12 house down a straight street, and houses spread out around us.  Behind our house was a field and to the right of this field was a baseball field and beside the baseball field a school with a playground.  Of course at 1:00 am no one was around and we lived in an already quiet neighborhood during the day so at night it was eerily quiet.  We had a lot of big trees in our yard but the baseball field was completely open so we decided it would be the perfect place to gaze up at the night sky.  We took some blankets out to the baseball field and laid them down on the dewy grass.  We laid down and looked up at the sky.  The stars were out and the moon was bright.  It was a clear night.  We laid out for about 20 minutes and we saw a lot of what looked like shooting stars which were meteors, of course.  Then I noticed something high up in the sky.  It looked like nothing I had seen before.  It was in the shape of an L.  It was large compared to the stars around it.  It looked like it had windows or lights down the base of the L.  It was still too almost like it was hovering.   I immediately told my dad and brother to look at it.  It was obviously some kind of flying object.  They both brushed and laughed it off.  My dad couldn’t tell me what it was.  He didn’t know what it was.  So we just kind of ignored it.   About 20 more minutes went by and we decided to go inside.  I looked up at the sky again to check back in on the mysterious object a! nd it wa s gone.  I had not even noticed it had left.  My dad and brother still say it was nothing but I know it wasn’t.   I have no explanation for the unexplained, but I do know that what we saw that night should not just be brushed off it should be explored.
