Circle lights in diamond formation, heading east then dispersing North, East and South.  Late evening. ((anonymous report));1994-06-01 22:00:00;1 minute;Circle lights in diamond formation, heading east then dispersing North, East and South. Late evening. It was early spring 1994, we were outside listening to music from the car stereo.  The stereo started to static which was odd because we were listening to CD.  As I got in the car to figure it out, I felt like I had to get out of the car to look up.  It was weird as we all looked up and see 5 lights right above us moving east in a diamond formation.  Then they turned up at a 90 degree, well over the speed of a fighter jet, no sound.  As they rose, 2 on the left side took off left (North), middle one went straight up, 2 on right went right (South).  They all disappeared so quickly.  CD static stopped and we all looked up, then looked at each other and ran inside. A few of us talked about, but none of us have spoken of this since then.

UFO over Wichita Kansas, at around 18:00 hr on Saturday July 29th 2006;2006-07-29 18:00:00;0:45;UFO over Wichita Kansas, at around 18:00 hr on Saturday July 29th 2006 What we saw was a round shape, transmuting between a solid metallic to a light form, the light wasn’t steady. The best way to describe it would be like a shaking light that was in the middle of the round metallic shape. The object was crossing the sky at around 18:00 hr on a clear day with an approximate altitude of 6000 ft heading north at low speed. The object never stopped its trajectory but the speed wasn’t constant, it did change a couple of times.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
UFO sighting wichita kansas aug 13 2010 2 crafts amber color;2010-08-13 12:00:00;10 mins;UFO sighting wichita kansas aug 13 2010 2 crafts amber color at 10pm i went outside to smoke a cigarette and saw two strange lights outside. one was an oval shape and the other was a weired looking triangular shape that had 1 long tail.  Both was a amber color similar to a candle light. the triangular one was on top towards the right of the oval.  they both hovered and it seemed like to be about maybe 5-10 miles away from where i was standing. first it both held its position for about 30 seconds then the triangular shape ufo started to diminish, it wasn't fast but very slow forming a second oval shape. that took about 20 secs, then the same triangular ufo that turned into a oval gotten smaller but didnt seem to more farther in distance.  it became a little spec of light and disappeared. keep in mind the lower oval shaped one was still there this whole time. ok it now gets better. then the oval shape one still hovered at the same position for about 3-5 minutes. then a light started to appear to the bottom left of the oval! shape and started to form a oval i think it was the second craft coming back. by then i was so amazed and a little freaked out. they both hovered for another 2-3 mins not moving or anything. then the lower left one started to fade. then the single oval shaped craft that never moved stood there another 2 mins then faded. that whole sighting lasted about 10 mins. it never changed color, just shape. i didnt hear any noise at all.. keep in mind the direction that i was looking at was towards McConnell air force, Cessna aircraft, and boeing. so it could have been a experimental plane but i know for sure a plane when i see one because i used to work in the aircraft industry. i truly believe i seen a UFO. i didnt have my phone on my at the time so i couldnt take any pictures.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
((HOAX??))  Green round ball flying through the sky;2010-12-19 20:30:00;30 seconds;Green round ball flying through the sky Well my wife and I were coming back from a funeral in New Mexico.  And I say it was close to between 8:30 to 9:00 p.m.  We were just outside of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. My mom and uncle were in a car ahead of us and our phone battery had died, and we were running low on gas, so we didnt want to stop or pullover until we had stopped together to get gas. So I am looking out the passenger window and I see this bright green ball about 2 miles away, my guess it was about 200 feet of the ground,and I could not see any blinking or flashing lights, just this green ball moving quickly across the sky, it was moving pretty fast,  I watched it go from east to west, then it moved more to the southwest.  Then as fast as I saw the object it dissappeared, all this happened so fast I didnt tell my wife until she asked me what I was looking at, now I wished I had her pullover and look at it. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder if this is a hoax.  Source elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.  The source of the report indicates that the sighting occurred on December 19, 2011.  Date is flawed, so we have amended it above.

It had a distinct vapor trail behind it as it descended behind the tree line but was not a jet. The sky was clear, no clouds, all blue sky. The formation was a hazy golden elongated oval or cigar shape. It moved silently, and had pretty quick descent. Very unusual looking.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
