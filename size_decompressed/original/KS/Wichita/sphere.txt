Sphere shaped and bright light, bopping up and down moving at the same speed as the airplane I was in.;2003-05-22 01:24:00;60 seconds or less;Sphere shaped and bright light, bopping up and down moving at the same speed as the airplane I was in. I was in an airplane on my way to my honey-moon when I was looking out the window, just looking around in awh. I had never been on a plane before. What I seen shocked me. There was a sphere looking light that looked like it was bouncing really fast along the skyline. We were not up to hight cause I could still see the ground pretty good. The light was so bright surprisingly because it was still daylight out. But I was sorta stuck in shock I couldnt take my eyes off the thing, I was infatuated with it. I wanted to tell my husband to look but I couldnt. When it was finally out of sight I turned away and looked down at my self and was thinking did I really just see that. And would my husband believe me, then I started thinking that maybe I was seeing things but the image is burnt in my head and I can still see it.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144

10 sphere objects over wichita ks municiple airport;2010-07-20 09:00:00;20 minutes;10 sphere objects over wichita ks municiple airport We wer fishing that morining, it was about 9:00 am . We were on a private pond just southeast of the WICHITA MUNICIPLE AIRPORT.  We wer facing the west wich is great view of the planes landing and taking off.I kept seeing these little white disc shaped objects.  I didnt pat much attention. when i looked up again, I could see these white disc objects again.   I asked the others guys that were with me if they could see what I was loooking at (as i was pointing to the sky) they said yes.  My buddy went to the truck to get his binoculars, we could all see the disc shaped objects in the sky.  It looked like they wer close to the planes landing and taking off.  Im sure the pilots could see and also the control tower.  There wer at least 10 objects in the sky at the end they seemed to look cigar shaped then they went in to the clouds.  They wer all moving at a slow then high rate of speed and not in any particular pattern.  Her in wichita kansas lately.  There seems to be some activity towards the airport in the sky at night.  The back of my house faces the airport great view of all aircraft and sky.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Looking east about 3 miles over the airforce base i watched a small sphere make small sudden movements then shoot out to the southeast.;2011-05-22 01:00:00;30+ minutes;Looking east about 3 miles over the airforce base i watched a small sphere make small sudden movements then shoot out to the southeast. I work odd hours so it is not uncommon for me to go outside and have a smoke at 2 or 3 in the morning. I usually look up at the stars and unwind before bed.   Last night about 2am, i was looking east from about the 3800 block of south hydraulic street.  I saw a light in the sky. the only way i can describe it is the light was different from a star.  I have a decent knowledge of astronomy and aerospace. (my family were engineers/ Navy/ chemists etc...  So I know the difference between the emission of light from stars and reflection of LEO satellites.   This light looked nothing like either.  It was radiating its own light source.  I studied  it for about 10 minutes and noticed it was oscillating slightly and making very small, rapid movements. Trying to keep an eye on the object and grab the camera from the desk right inside the door.  I took 3 pictures zoomed out all the way. cant make anything out except a small light dot.  The next 3 I took were zoomed in all the way.  I used a 4 year old Canon EasyShare 10Mp digital camera. It pulsed amber light a few times and shot off toward mulvane/Udal area. My wife was NOT amused I woke her this late to tell her what I saw ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
Moving across the sky .. Orange sphere .. running totally silent;2013-06-02 22:30:00;30 seconds;Moving across the sky .. Orange sphere .. running totally silent 2013-06-02 .. South East Wichita Kansas .. 10:30 PM  witness 1: ..  witness 2 and I saw UFO june 2 at 10:30 PM Southeast flying northwest.  I zoomed in with my phone but lost the vid.  Orange (robby thought purplish) pulsating sphere.  In my zoom, I saw it break into a lot of pieces and then come back together.  Lasted about 30 seconds.  The freaky clincher was that it was completely silent!  witness 2: .. witness 1 and I were sitting at the fire pit Sunday night facing south @ approx 10:30 PM .. the second I saw it approaching from behind the trees .. I immediately knew this was something different .. I looked at ((female name deleted)) and said:  stand up.. as it emerged from behind the tree .. it was now in plain sight .. a VERY BRIGHT AND GLOWING redish/orange/purple-ish tint .. a completely round and spherical object . . . as if you held out a penny between your thumb and finger as far as you could and moved it across the sky .. it was moving approx 120 mph like a small plane preparing to land .. moving in a straight line (as a satellite would) but low and slow . . . this WAS NOT an airplane or mechanical craft .. it was hard to tell just how far away it was .. but to me .. it looked close enough to be able to hear if it was something mechanical .. it had no beacon lights .. it had no wing-span and it made absolutely NO sound AT ALL . . . the wind speed was no ! more than 1 mph . . . we watched it for about 25-30 seconds as it approached from the South East and traveled to the North West until it disappeared behind our house and tree line . . .((female name deleted)) watched it in her camera phone (zoomed in) and said for about 2 seconds .. it seemed to separate into smaller pieces as in fireworks (she mentioned fireworks) and then it gathered itself back together . . . the weather was cool/still/very clear and vivid stars . . . something messed up with the phone and ((female name deleted)) was notable to save the video . . .
