Around 11:45 AM I am contacted by friend who is over 900 nautical miles away to go look outside at the waxing moon.  I went to the back yard (north side of house) and found the moon and then saw it.  A bright white orb that was stationary, moving in progression with the moon. It appeared big enough to see clearly with 6 x 25 Bushnell binoculars and easy to see with the naked eye since I was standing in the shade of the two story house. The weather was not a factor and there was no clouds and the sky was bright blue. There was no sound or anything emitting from the object. I then proceeded to get my 50 X zoom digital camera out and took still photos from 12:08 through 12:40 PM. The photos are taken at normal focal length and then full zoom, with date/time stamps.  Also without any filtering (polarized or UV).  In fact it could not be seen with the filtering on the camera, only without.  There is no video.  The photos show in one frame two separate orbs of light separated by three widths of the moon, but not detectable with the naked eye. I also had time to set up my Meade refactor telescope and have a very detailed look at the orb.  It changed shape many times going from an elliptical to flat white shape with white light emitting from it. While I was getting the telescope setup my wife also observed it with the binoculars and later looking through the telescope as I took photos. There were no aircraft in the area at low or high altitude.  No contrails. Very similar to other sightings seen since 2009 in the daytime.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
One light became four;2016-02-13 05:30:00;A few seconds;One light became four February 13, 2016, in Wichita, Kansas.  About 5:30 am, I was taking my dogs out to potty.  I looked up and saw what I thought must be a satellite moving fast from East to West across the sky.  As it got straight overhead, I noticed that it seemed to be flashing white and red and knew it wasn't a satellite.   After another moment, the light separated and spread to four lights in a rectangular formation.  There was no sound and the speed and direction never changed.;37.7022126605503;-97.3325398165144
