7 lights of one craft veiwed at night over south east Kansas.;2005-11-15 23:00:00;45 seconds;7 lights of one craft veiwed at night over south east Kansas. First of all id like to tell you i used to think people who were into this stuff were a bunch of weirdos. Not till i saw one myself, along with my grandparents, aunt, and cousin, which im glad because none of them would beleive me if i told them  I JUST SAW A UFO! Anyways...  The Sighting occured 2 years ago, i just now was interested in reporting it, it lasted about 45 sec. just outside of Parsons, KS. It was just a bright red light that caught the corner of my eye.   As i looked over, it appeared to open up with the first light i saw stopping, then, simultaneously two lights on each side of the single light lit up, then two more lights on the sides of those lit up at the same time, with two more to light on the side of them.  There were seven total lights.  Then, without moving it appeared to close up the same as it had opened, with the two outside lights going off simultaneously then the next, then the next. with only the middle light visible it appeared to move to a different area in the sky. Then it opened and closed the same way. It did this maybe 4 times.  Then, almost suddenly it shot off, open, with an incredible speed. I could not beleive what i saw.  I have you know that this experience sparked my intrest for ufology and astronomy, i hope to serve in those fields. I want to know all i can. Please take this seriously, i have no reason to lie. I am a christian, if that means nothing to you, you should know they are honest. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
