Small ball of white light moving incredibly fast to the South East of Parsons, KS.;2012-11-01 19:07:00;60-70 seconds;Small ball of white light moving incredibly fast to the South East of Parsons, KS. I, age 16, and my father, age 62, were exiting our house in the center of town to leave for dinner.  We had just gotten into the truck, and while rolling up my window I glanced at a bright star or planet to the South-South East giving off shine that I often look up to glance at.  I noticed a bright star I assumed I hadn't noticed before just off to the side of this other star, but when I glanced out the passenger side window I noticed it was moving at an incredible speed, I estimate 200mph, in a South Eastern direction.   My father, being a veteran birder, picked up his binoculars and glanced, then passed them to me.  What I observed was a small ball of light, pure and shimmering white moving INCREDIBLY fast.  It cleared all the way to the horizon in at least a minute flat.  I've seen satellites move before but not at such an accelerated rate.;37.3461;-95.2725
