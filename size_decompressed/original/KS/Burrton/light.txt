I yelled at my sister and her friend and we watched it fly over us and pass us and the light never changed brightens or had any glare or projection just like a weird bright glow.  Couldn't see anything other than bright orb came into my view and left my view approx 4 min. After returning home later that morning a neighbor stooped me on the way in to tell me about a sighting  just a week  be for in McPherson.   So I go to tell my mom what  the neighbor said and what my sister and I saw and even she had a separate sighting about a week before with three orange/white orbs that lasted about 15 min in tell she said she just felt so uncomfortable she couldn't watch anymore.;38.0247;-97.6666
