Orange sphere seen by 5 people iola kansas 07/04/2009.;2009-07-04 23:00:00;3 minutes;orange sphere seen by 5 people iola kansas 07/04/2009 It was about 11 pm at night. We were kind of the east side of town, if I remember right.  I looked up and from the north I saw a orange dot. Some one commented that it was probably an amber from the fire works show and I was like the show had been over for a couple hours now. We walked out to the road and an orange sphere object, if i could guess about maybe 10 to 20 ft in diameter about 300 hundred yards away and about 200 yards up, it was just above the height of a water tower, flew by us.   it was too fast but was moving along. Made no noise what so ever.  Had orange glow about it, i couldn't tell where it was coming from the inside or if it was shinny?  Glowed orange. We all just kind of looked at each other and went back to the porch sat down and talked.  Then another one showed up on the same path as the first one about hour later. We watched it fly by.;37.9253;-95.3976
