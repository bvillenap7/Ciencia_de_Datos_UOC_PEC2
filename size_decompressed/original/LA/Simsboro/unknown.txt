Multicolored lights seen in Eastern sky in North Louisiana.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we would guess.  PD));2012-01-24 03:10:00;1 hour;Multicolored lights seen in Eastern sky in North Louisiana In the southwestern sky, I noticed a twinkling.  Too vivid to be a star/planet, too high in the air to be a cell tower, too many colors flashing to be an aircraft.  The only device I own that could be used to view more closely was the scope on my .22 rifle.  I can only describe what I saw as a seemingly multi-colored array of sparks and/or electricity, but maintaining an almost nautical star shape. It was very difficult to see, even with the scope but actually appeared larger to the naked eye.  I've never seen anything like that in all my 33 years, and my girlfriend saw it as well.  We are ufo cynics, so this sight was a bit unsettling. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we would guess.  PD));32.5362;-92.8006
