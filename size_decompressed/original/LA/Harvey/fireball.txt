Red fireball observed above Harvey, La. moving from North to South direction.;2014-01-19 18:20:00;5 minutes;Red fireball observed above Harvey, La. moving from North to South direction. Red fireball observed moving in sky, north to south direction, observed at northerly direction from about 50degrees above horizon, moving towards south to about 75degrees above horizon, at which point moving appeared to stop for a minute or so, object appeared to dim/fade in glow, as if moving away from earth towards a slight easterly direction, until completely disappearing. For comparison, I looked around sky for jet or plane with lights on, saw one towards southeast traveling from east to southeast direction.  I was able to see this planes lights typical of a jet flying at night.  Lights on this plane did not match that of red fireball. Then about minute or two later observed a dull glowing object of very faint grayish/white light in direction of southwest, moving again from northerly to southerly direction, this time about 40degrees above horizon, until object disappeared.
