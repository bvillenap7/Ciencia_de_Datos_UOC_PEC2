I saw what I first naturally assumed to be a flock of birds in a V formation, but this was 2 hours after sunset, and they were flying East to West, then headed Southeast, moving silenty and elegantly. I had taken the dog outside to do his business at 8:00 P.M. C.S.T., and I knew the exact time because I had checked my watch. The sun had been set about 2 hours, and because a cold front had passed through the area a few days before, the sky was extremely clear. While I was waiting for the dog , I just looked up into the clear night sky to stargaze on this unusually clear night. Toward the East I saw what I naturally assumed to bea flock of birds in a V formation. They were moving relatively quickly, silently, and elegantly from East to West, then after a 15 seconds  or so, headed Southeast. I noticed no significant sounds nor any flapping ofwings, and their color was brownish, and individually each more all winged shaped. I found this weird because I've never known birds to flock orfly in a V formation well after sunset and so silently. I only told a few close friends and my wife of this event, and only after I saw it reoported on this site, did i finally decide to report it myself.;29.8715;-90.07
