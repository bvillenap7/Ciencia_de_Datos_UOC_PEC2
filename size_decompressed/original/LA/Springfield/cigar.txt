Saw weird cigar-like shape in sky in daylight.;2014-11-23 16:00:00;2 minutes;saw weird cigar like shape in sky in daylight. I was outside and I saw no clouds.  I thought that it was weird for the past few days so as I look to my right I saw it clear as day but no sound.   That's when I call some one else to witness that what I saw was what I saw a long kind of round at the tips cigar shaped thing with a black band.   I + one heard nothing it left no smock and waited a while later but no sound yeah don't know what it is but um I just don't know I'm looking up from now on.
