I went to the front door to let my cat in after hearing him meow.  He ran in I saw, over to my left, about 6 feet away and about 8 or 9 feet up from the ground, an object shaped like 2 saucers put together (tops of saucers facing so that the object was widest in its center and the widest part was parallel with the ground).   I stepped out onto my small porch to look at it.  The object was about 2 feet in diameter.  Where the saucers were put together, a greenish light shone forth.   A beam of greenish light shot out and I felt myself immobilized.  At the same time, I felt a message (feeling, not words)of kindness and goodness transmitted, and I felt a love for the mind(s) that sent the message and smiled slightly.   The beam scanned me from head to toe.  No memory of anything else....I guess I just went back inside.   Strange thing is, I had no memory of the event for several years....I don't know how long this amnesia lasted.  All I know is that at! some point the memory returned to me and that I still have it and remember it with very positive feelings.   I don't know if it makes any difference, but I was about 25 years old and had had a tubal ligation a few months prior so, was unable to conceive any more.;30.4157;-90.5775
