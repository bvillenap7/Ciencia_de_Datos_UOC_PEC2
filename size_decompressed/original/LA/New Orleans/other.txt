Hugh blinking red light over New Orleans East.;1974-11-02 00:00:00;10 seconds;Hugh blinking red light over New Orleans East. As I stood in my front doorway facing out and talking to husband a huge reddish blinking light traveled from over my house just above the roof and headed west.   The red blinking light was the size of a basketball at arm's length.  It looked like it was about to crash as it went straight downward just behind some trees that were three blocks away.   There was no sound at all and I thought it was a plane crash.   Checking the news on television and newspapers there were no report of a plane crashing or any reports of this sighting.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Are you interested in unexplained noises?;1997-03-12 09:00:00;5-10 Seconds;Summary : Are you interested in unexplained noises? At approximately 9:00 a.m. Wednesday, March 12, a huge boom rattled windows and residents throughout south Louisiana and Mississippi. The event, as yet unexplained, shook a surface area 80 miles n/s and 100 miles e/w.  Military installations in the area deny supersonic flight by any of their craft, and, at least on this occasion, they should be believed. This was no ordinary jet boom.  In mid New Orleans, people went into the streets to look for signs of the explosion.  The next day, newspapers reported the event, but, now, 5 days later, no explanation for the occurrence has been offered.I can send newpaper clipping if needed.  I would need a fax number;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
((HOAX??))  Organized objects some jets some idk over NOLA.;2013-07-14 01:43:00;2-3 hours;Organized objects some jets some idk over NOLA Ok.. first off I saw Chinook helicopters coming into new orleans around 7-8 pm.  Went outside around 10pm to see a HUGE orange orb it looked like it was a smoldering lava rock but perfectly round not moving a hair..  it stayed in the sky for about 10-12 minutes. I eventually witnessed it just literally blink and it was just gone. .  Wife and I were very weirded out soon after maybe 30 minutes later we started hearing fighter jets what it sounded like.  Around 12 am I heard it for the 3rd time eventually she went to sleep and I stayed outside.  1:43 am rolls around and what looked like jets with odd red pulsating lights some with different formations of light patterns on the belly started to damn near break sound barriers.  The crazy thing is I could 100% identify jets but some of them didnt have thrusters on the back and the one that stuck out most was straight narrow with three red lights on the belly and didnt have a thruster nor sound.  So idk wtf is going on!  but someone said it was a top secret training exercise. . Idgaf who you are but if you believe its a training exercise at 1 -3 am your just a sheep to me.

Large dark gray dolphin-shaped object in the air found in a photograph, but was not seen or heard.  ((NUFORC Note:  Pigeon.  PD));2015-11-14 10:23:00;1 photo;Large dark gray dolphin-shaped object in the air found in a photograph, but was not seen or heard by the photographer. My girlfriend’s sister was on a trip in New Orleans, Louisiana, and she snapped a picture of a multi-seat horse drawn carriage with her Iphone. Only later did she see the strange irregularly dolphin shaped and fairly large dark gray object floating in the air in the photograph. I asked her if she saw it or heard any sounds and she said no. She didn't hear anything, and she did not see it. The photo was taken on November 14, 2015, at 10:23 AM (not sure if it was Eastern or Central time as the photo EXIF data doesn’t specify. The phone's owner lives in North Carolina so if it doesn't change with the local carrier, it would be set to Eastern Time). ((NUFORC Note:  Pigeon.  PD));29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Strange Beams of Light over New Orleans;2018-01-23 22:00:00;15-20 minutes;Strange Beams of Light over New Orleans. My daughter texted me a photo of a beam of light she saw over the New Orleans skyline around 10:00 PM this evening, January 27, 2018. She described the beam as the kind of fire-orange.  It emerged from the clouds and remained for about 15-20 minutes.  During that time, a second beam also appeared nearby.  Then they just disappeared.  Another friend also saw this and posted about it on social media.  I've included his photo as well.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Point of light, like a satellite, transiting the sky east to west, made abrupt directional changes that seemed to defy physics.;2019-05-13 22:11:00;8-9 seconds;a point of light, like a satellite, transiting the sky east to west, made abrupt directional changes that seemed to defy physics. On the evening of Monday, May 13, 2019, in New Orleans, LA, I was facing south/southeast, watching what appeared to be a satellite or the space station transit the sky, east to west, passing almost across the face of the moon (a solid point of light, not blinking, traveling much faster than an airplane, I have witnessed these events many times before) when it made an abrupt turn down and to the right, then back on its original track, before making an equally abrupt turn up and then off on a track perpendicular to the original path.  I’ve been watching the night sky since 1987 and have never seen anything like this prior to last night .;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
