two lights circling each other in the night time sky then shooting away from each other in new orleans louisiana.;1986-06-01 23:00:00;30 sec;two lights circling each other in the night time sky then shooting away from each other in new orleans louisiana. I was about 13 years of age at the time. My uncle was a fisherman and I worked on his boat in the summer as a deckhand. While waiting to leave for the overnight shrimping trip I was looking at the stars when I observed two bright lights circling each other at a high altitude. they looked like stars but were moving at a very high rate of speed. I went to where my uncle was an advised him to look up and pointed to where the lights were and he also observed them of a few seconds circling each other and right after that the two lights shot away from each other in opposite directions at incredible speeds and then they faded away. I have no idea what they were. Stars? Ive never heard of two stars getting caught up togeher like that and then shooting away from each other. Who knows?

((HOAX??))Really weird to see an object flow across the sky slowly but then take off from one end of the sky to the other in seconds.;1999-02-20 20:00:00;30m;Really weird to see an object flow across the sky slowly but then take off from one end of the sky to the other in seconds I was standing outside gazing into space and all of a sudden I see this star that gets really bright.  First, it floated across the sky real slow.  Second it just took off in a zig zag motion travling at the speed of light and then it floated slowly again this went on for about thirty minutes and then it disappeard!  I always tell people about it but they never believe so I just wonder about it to my self all the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Light streaked across sky ... power failure/brownout followed.;1999-09-02 03:30:00;2 hours;Light streaked across sky ... power failure/brownout followed. A light streaked across the sky from West to East and at the same time power failed in a large part of New Orleans. After the power failure, a brown-out condition existed for approximately two hours. I called the local power provider, Entergy, and the stated that they had numerous reports of outages at the same time (3:30AM). This was the same night as the West Coast event (objects in the sky, alleged booster reentry) featured live on the Art Bell Pgm. ((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected, at request of witness.  The alleged brown-outs occurred on the morning of Thursday, 02SE99, measured in local time for New Orleans.));29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
ufo streaked across the sky, like to know what we saw.;1999-12-26 20:00:00;15-20 sec.s;ufo streaked across the sky, like to know what we saw. My wife and I were sitting outside when she noticed a light in the sky behind me and exclaimed look at that. I looked up and observed a bright light moving rapidly North in a straight line. I watched the object until trees on the horizon blocked it from view. I thought the object was probably something burning up entering the atmosphere as it streaked across the sky, and when it was almost out of sight I thought I saw a splinter of light seperate. There were no navigation lights and it was larger than any meteor I ever saw. I have seen satellites but this was larger and brighter. This object left no tail, which is curious to me as I witnessed the space shuttle reentering the atmosphere to land in Florida. I am a pilot and my wife is a nurse.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Satellite in sky over New Orleans?;2004-01-28 19:20:00;5 mins;Satellite in sky over New Orleans? Jan 28, 2004.  At 7:20pm, while taking my dogs outside, I looked up at the moon which was approx. 70 degrees in the western sky at the time, and I noticed what I thought was a satellite traveling across the sky in an easterly direction. The object appeared to me to be the same intensity as an average star and was not blinking.  I noticed it in the western sky, and watched it move under the moon (about 3 inches under moon from my perspective) and across the sky, heading toward Orion's belt. I watched the object for 1 min before opening up the front door and calling to my boyfriend, who was on the computer at the time.  I told him I thought there was a satellite and he should come check it out.  While he was on the way outside, I watched the star-like object pass through the constellation Orion and start to fade out, as if high, thin clouds were passing over.  By the time he made it outside, I could no longer see the object in the sky. I pointed out the direction (southern sky) of where I last saw the object to my boyfriend, but he didn't see anything. I continued to watch the southern sky to see if I could spot the object again.  My boyfriend was watching the sky to the NNE and spotted an object that looked like a star moving fast across the sky in a southernly direction.  The object moved at first in a straight line, then moved erratically, and back to a straight line.  The object seemed to him to leave sort of a small trail as it moved across the sky.  I looked up to where he was seeing the object and I did not spot it.  He lost sight of it soon after and also seemed to lose interest, as he went back inside.  The duration between the time that I first spotted my object to the time that my boyfriend went back inside was approx. 5 mins. I stayed outside watching the southern sky in the direction where I lost sight of the object I was viewing.  I watched for another 5 mins. or so and spotted the object again, in the same place where it seemed to pass behind the high, thin clouds, as if it had stopped and started moving again.  This could have been another object,  I am not sure.  It was still traveling toward the east, but the intensity of the light was not as bright as before, still suggesting the cloud cover.  I immediately called for my boyfriend to come back out.  When I looked back up to the sky, I could no longer see the object. It was a very clear night, with high, thin clouds starting to appear from the SSW on the GOES-12 infrared weather satellite (I checked this 30 mins. later), but no clouds were visible from my perspective.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Star-like object meandering in sky.;2004-02-28 18:40:00;15 seconds;Star-like object meandering in sky 6:40pm Central time. While outside talking on the cell phone with my mother, I looked up at the moon, which was directly overhead, and saw a star-like object in the southern sky move westward toward the moon. It looked just like an average star, except it was moving. The object did not blink, was white in color and appeared to be very high in the atmosphere. It did not leave a trail and was moving approximately the same speed as a satellite. The object passed under the moon and was obscured by clouds moving in from the south. The sky was mostly cloudy at the time with a few breaks in between to where the moon and stars were clearly visible.  When I saw the object, I pointed in the direction I was looking (south) and said to my boyfriend and mother (on the phone), Look at that star moving up there, by the moon! I viewed the object for 3 or 4 seconds before I lost sight of it behind the clouds. I looked at the time on the cell phone and noticed it to be 6:40pm. My boyfriend did not see the object, but continued to look at the sky. My mother, who lives on the North shore of the Lake Pontchartrain (I live on the South shore), did not see the object as she was inside at the time. I then told my mother I would call her back and continued watching for the object, but did not spot it again.  We decided to stay outside a little longer and I continued to watch the sky, which was still mostly cloudy with fewer breaks in between the visible areas.  7:40pm - Spotted what appeared to be the same object again in the Southeastern part of the sky, which was clear at the time. I pointed it out to my boyfriend and said, There it is again! We both watched the object move erratically northward, then ENE until it passed out of our view of the horizon. Looked at the clock on the cell phone and it was exactly one hour later than the first sighting. Duration of second sighting was 10 to 12 seconds. When I spotted the object the second time (my boyfriend did not see this part), it moved quickly in a very erratic motion then moved northward at a steady rate, where my boyfriend was also able to pick it up. The general movement of the star-like object reminded me of an insect in flight (specifically a dragonfly), where the dragonfly would hover over a potential landing site, i.e.: stick or twig, examine the site a bit but not landing (or as if it was performing evasive maneuvers from another insect) and then flying off to find a better spot, not in a straight line but meandering.  I then called my mother again and told her what I saw. I said the object was heading in her general direction and she should go outside and see if she could spot it. I told her it was pretty cloudy on the South shore of the lake, but the North shore seemed to be in a clearing, as she did not see any clouds, nor did she see the object.  Another factor that my be relevant, but was not noticed at 6:40pm, possibly due to the cloud cover, is there was a strange halo around the moon (one quarter full) that I had never seen before.  The halo was approximately 6 1/2 to 7 feet in diameter from my perspective with the moon being 1/2 inch in diameter. I have see halos around the moon many times before, but they were always close to the moon, never this far away! My father said the halo was probably due to ice crystals in the atmosphere reflecting the light of the moon. The color of the halo was the same color as the moon and a perfect circle. I watched as clouds covered the area of the sky that the moon was located and the halo was also covered. I could only see it when there was a break in the clouds. The object, when spotted the second time, was within this halo on the Eastern side (moon was now in SW sky). I watched the object pass out of the halo and continue on as described above.  We went inside at this point since there were just too many clouds. I went back outside at 8:40pm and the halo was still around the moon, but I could only get glimpses of it through the clouds. The sky was almost completely covered in clouds at this point. I did not spot the object again.  I then went back inside and received a call from my mother. She stated that she could also see the halo around the moon, but it appeared to be purplish in color to her. She also saw 2 beams of iridescent light shining down in her general direction on the North shore of the lake, between 8:00pm and 8:40pm, she's not sure of the time as she was going in and out of the house. She described the lights as being an upside-down v, with the moon being the starting point. The lights appeared to be bubbling inside with iridescence, as stated by my mother. She thought the lights might be a trick of the eye or a reflection off of her glasses. She could not tell if the beams of light were touching the ground from her vantage point. My mother said she began to feel uneasy at this point and went back inside. I went back outside to see if I could see this as well, but the moon was not visible.  My mother calls back at 8:50pm and says, I'm not going out there anymore! I saw the beams of light again. She went on to describe the lights as stated above, but felt like one of the beams was shining directly at her. She got scared and went back inside. I haven't heard from her this morning, but I assume since she didn't call me back, she didn't observe anything else unusual.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Yellowish/orange star like light;2004-04-09 21:10:00;20 seconds;Yellowish/orange star like light April 9, 2004:   At 8:45pm central time, I was observing the sky to the east and noticed a star like object in the sky that was moving downward. The object seemed to be rotating high in the atmosphere and was reflecting light at intervals of 3 to 4 seconds while it moved slowly downward, almost snakelike. The light seemed to be the steady magnitude of a dim star when not reflecting. I lost sight of the object at about 30 degrees above the horizon.  9:10pm:   At my zenith facing eastward, I saw another star like object moving SSW and followed it for about 20 seconds with 7x35 binoculars. The color of the light through the binoculars was yellowish blending into an orange/red on the outer edge and did not blink or pulse. I could see no shape to the object, only light. I looked down to see what the time was, and when I looked back up, I could no longer find the object. Weather conditions were clear and mild.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Pulses of light;2004-05-07 21:15:00;1 minute;Tonight at 9:10pm central time, I took my dogs outside. While waiting, I looked to the northwest and noticed a satellite heading southward. I moved around in the yard quite a bit to keep the satellite, Cosmos Rocket 1943 or 1697, in my view and I watched it until I could no longer see it.  I continued to watch the sky to the west. At 9:15pm, I saw a brief pulse of white light out of the corner of my eye which made me turn my head to the right slightly. About 60 degrees west, I saw the pinpoint of light pulse one time for approx. ½ second, then go out, then reappear 3 seconds later a tiny bit further to the northwest, stay lit for ½ second , then go out again. I watched this process for approx. one minute until I could no longer see it due to trees blocking the view. The object was heading northwestward. The color of the light did not change and was only visible when it would pulse. The duration of the pulses of light were always ½ a second long, but duration between pulses ranged anywhere from 2 to 7 seconds. The magnitude of the pulse was that of an average star, well below that of Venus, which was clearly visible to me in the western sky. I observed 2 aircraft heading eastward and was able to determine that the pulses of light were not like the aircraft in anyway. I checked Heavens Above.com and there were no satellites at this time heading northwest. The object covered ¼ of the sky in about one minute.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803

My wife said it was white light whereas I thought I saw a blue light. But both of us saw the same light shoot across the sky although we could not agree on color. We were headed west just past the Nichols exit about  5 minutes traveling about 65 mph. Light disappeared just as quick as it appeared. Possible shooting star bc it shot horizontally.  Was not a flare because didn't have upward or downward arc. Slightly foggy night but bright enough that both of us saw same light.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803

At about 20:39 I was watering my plants on my porch when I saw a reddish/copper light originate from the southeast and travel across the sky.  I turned away thinking it a satellite, but when I turned around there were 6 more in line across the sky.  All originating from the same location in my southeast horizon.  They all dissapeared in different directions.  Then more and more kept following...  Last one crossed the sky at approximately 20:47.  About 16-18 total.

Extremely fast object across New Orleans sky;2014-07-12 22:00:00;3-5 seconds;Extremely fast object across New Orleans sky A friend and I were in the front yard when we saw a supremely fast object travel from one side of the New Orleans sky to the other--until it went out of sight.  It was traveling at an incredible speed, easily thousands of miles per hour with absolutely no sound.    We thought it was a comet or shooting star but it was too low for that.  Also no trail or smoke and it appeared to maintain a constant speed.  Imagine an object going from one end of the sky to the other in 3-4 seconds!   Also as it moved past I noticed a slights green and blue hue.   I've seen plenty of shooting stars and this was not a shooting star or a satelite (it was low).   We were absolutely in awe at the speed of this object! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803

Cobalt blue light.;2015-06-12 03:45:00;2 seconds;Huge bright cobalt blue light streaked behind a building in the horizon.  It was in the north east east sky relative to downtown New Orleans.   It was traveling multiple Mach, way faster than any plane could have possibly flown.  I have seen many meteors in my life, this was definitely not one.   I would suspect it crashed or impacted based in its trajectory somewhere along the Mississippi gulf coast area.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
7 lights flying in formation, changing positions, and angles of flight.;2016-05-08 01:00:00;15 minutes;7 lights flying in formation, changing positions and angles of flight. About 1 am this morning, several of us were chatting in our French Quarter courtyard when my wife pointed to the sky to ask what “that” was.  We had turned all of the lights off 15 minutes earlier, so our eyes were accustomed to the dark and we were using my Google Sky app to point out the planets and constellations.  It was a rare clear night (for us) and the stars and planets were particularly sharp.   As I was pointing out Saturn (the brightest point in the sky at the time), my wife pointed out the objects moving in formation about 25 degrees east of Saturn.  There were 7 or 8 points of light, maybe 1/3 the brightness of Saturn and a little smaller, moving slowly towards the North.  2 or 3 in the lead, 3 more fanned out behind and 2 more bringing up the rear.  They would change positions but moved at the same rate of speed in tandem – very slowly – with an occasional stop to regroup before proceeding again.  Far too high, close together and small for any ai! rport or military traffic, which don’t fly that trajectory anyway when approaching Armstrong Airport.   The members of our party watched them, mostly in silence, for close to 15 minutes until they disappeared behind the buildings.  We tried video-ing the lights, but the footage didn’t turn out.   It was a pretty well-heeled and older group of us at the end of our party – a real estate agent, a general contractor, 2 lawyers, 2 musicians and (I believe) a retired judge.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
