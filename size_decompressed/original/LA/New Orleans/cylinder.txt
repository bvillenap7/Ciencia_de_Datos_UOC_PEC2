Black cylinders over French Quarter;1999-11-01 00:00:00;10 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) Black cylinders over French Quarter I was browsing through your site to see if anyone from New Orleans has reported seeing black cylinder objects crossing the sky over the city.  I read a report of a someone who saw something similar to what I have witnessed three different times in the French Quarter and the Central Business District of New Orleans.  The report I read said in 2/01, the witness only saw one black object slowly moving across the sky.  Every time I have seen these objects there were two in formation, casually crossing the sky, all three times I witnessed them at dusk.  They move very slowly in a direct path from NW to SE across the city.  The most dramatic sighting occured the first time...I was on my balcony, in the late afternoon, on St. Philip St. with my friend, when I noticed the objects moving across the sky.  At first I thought they might be birds flying from Lake Salvador to Pontchartrain, as there is always an increased amount of birds in the sky at nightfall.  I soon realized they weren't birds and I told my friend to check them out.  He got a little freaked out by them but we watched them slowly move across the sky.  About the time they  had reached the Eastern part of the city, and I estimate they were over or near Lake Ponchartrain, an incoming airliner apparantly swerved at the last minute to miss them, the sound of the jet's engines increasing as the plane veered to it's right and up to avoid the objects which just kept on their course.  We were pretty amazed at the whole thing. I have seen the objects twice since then, both times at sunset and both times they were flying on the same course over the city.  We have a lot of Military  bases near us in Mississippi and Florida, and we often get F-15s and even those warthog planes flying over.  I suspect it may be aircraft from a base because of the routine in flight pattern and time of day.  But whatever they are, they aren't using jet propulsion and they aren't prop-driven.  They are just black cyliners moving slowly  across the sky and are un-affected by the motion of the wind.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Black Cylinder object seen in the French quarter of New Orleans;2001-02-06 18:45:00;30-90 seconds;Black Cylinder object seen in the French quarter of New Orleans I was walking down Iberville St. towards Bourbon St. at est. time of 1845hrs CST. When I noticed a black cylinder object hovering above the buildings (est. 200-300ft). I noticed there was no sound from the object that I could tell. I stopped to men at the corner of Bourbon St. and asked them if they where seeing the same thing. They looked up and saw the object and stated it must be a UFO here for the partying, at that time other stopped and noticed that we were looking up and they notice the object. The object was moving at a slow rate heading in the direction of the Mississippi river. I know that people think I was drinking but, I was not and I know what I saw was real and that others saw it too. If anyone else saw that object in the New Orleans area please report it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.  He had the presence of mind to call the object to the attention of other witnesses, and his description of the object was quite precise.  We do not know what it was he witnessed, but similar objects have been reported to NUFORC.  An object, apparently similar in appearance, was reported from Houston, TX, on the morning of 08SE00.  It was reported to have been seen hovering over the outer ring road at approximately 0615 hrs. (local) on that date.  PD));29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803

I think these two almost matching UFO photos add much more credibility to both.;2011-10-23 19:00:00;1 second;I think these two almost matching UFO photos add much more credibility to both. NFL GAME,  CHINA UFO MATCH?   Not sure if you will consider this relevant but thought I'd send it in case you might. While perusing YOU TUBE UFO videos last night I came across something curiously coincidental about the recent NFL SUNDAY NIGHT GAME UFO incident. First, pull up the NFL GAME VIDEO on YOU TUBE. Look at those still pictures which the typical media skeptics immediately downplayed as bugs and such. Then pull up the YOU TUBE video  UFO OVER CHINA JULY 7TH, REAL!  14 seconds into the CHINA UFO video you will see what appears to be an almost identical UFO still photo match to the NFL GAME one. Two bugs?  I have sent this UFO match observation story to Coast To Coast AM as I would think these two world apart but very much alike photos side by side would make for an intriguing view for their internet site visiting, UFO interested audience.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
