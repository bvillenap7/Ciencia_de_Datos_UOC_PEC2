Trail of fire in the sky extinguishes itself to reveal tear shaped craft hovering before rapid acceleration;2014-10-25 18:30:00;10-15 minutes;Trail of fire in the sky extinguishes itself to reveal tear shaped craft hovering before rapid acceleration On October 25th, 2014, at approximately 18:30 hours, I, along with a female friend, spotted what we believe to be a U.F.O. while driving from New Orleans, L.A. to Hammond, L.A.   We spotted the craft while driving west bound on interstate I-10, between Kenner, L.A. and Laplace, L.A.  The craft was to our left, to the south west.  At first it looked like an airplane was on fire and falling out of the sky.  There was a long trail of what can only be described as fire followed by smoke.  At first glance I would guess that this streak of fire was somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 feet in the air, which made me initially think that it might be an airplane on fire.  We continued to watch the object as we drove west bound on I-10.  We began to realize that whatever this was it was falling at a very slow rate, almost as if it wasn’t falling at all.  After watching this object for roughly 8-10 minutes, what appeared to be fire and smoke had extinguished and the craft ! was now visible and at roughly 10,000-15,000 feet in the air to the south west of Laplace, L.A.   The best way I can describe the object is to say that it was shaped like a pistachio shell.  There were no visible wings, props, or engines.  Its’ exterior was smooth.  When the body of the craft became visible it was apparent that it was no longer moving at all.  It was hovering around 10,000 feet.  We watched it hovering in the sky for roughly 10 seconds before it started to accelerate from a stand still.  It gained a tremendous amount of speed in less than 3 seconds.  Roughly 15 seconds after it began to accelerate we lost sight of it. I should note that the way in which it flew was eerily similar to what is portrayed in a science fiction movie.  It moved across the sky as if time had suddenly stopped and the only thing left in motion was the craft itself.  It was very strange.  I work in the aviation industry and am quite familiar with different types of aircrafts.  I can honestly say I’ve never seen anything move across the sky like I did on the afternoon of October 25th.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
