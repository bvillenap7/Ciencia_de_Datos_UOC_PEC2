I was outside waiting for my boyfriend to come outside. I was looking up at the sky and all of a sudden I saw a series of little orange fireballs fly across the sky.  They were not going very fast.  They appeared in the west and slowly disappeared into the east.  When I realized that there were many of them continuously floating across the sky, I ran and found my boyfriend and he was amazed as well.  He only saw the last 2 or 3 fireballs. I saw about 11 or 12.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Three orange lights seen over Lake Pontchartrain, New Orleans, La.;2014-08-15 20:45:00;2 minutes;Three orange lights seen over Lake Pontchartrain, New Orleans, La. I stepped on the back porch facing West at 8:45 pm.  I observed 3 orange lights in the same spot I had observed, photographed and recorded video of them on September, 14, 2013.  Less than 10 miles away, over the South off shore of Lake Pontchartrain, bordering New Orleans to the North. I grabbed my camera and took a few shots before they disappeared.  Cloud cover may have obscured them.  The top one disappeared first.  The middle one seemed to move either up or closer to my position before it was not able to be seen. The 3rd one, the bottom one, acted the same way, moving up or closer and then was not able to be seen. It lasted less than 2 minutes.   7 still shots and 7 seconds of video taken.  No signs or sounds of aircraft in the area.  The dogs in the area were barking.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
