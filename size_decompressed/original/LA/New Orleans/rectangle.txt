PD));2009-04-19 05:22:00;1/3200;Four objects over MSY Airport New Orleans On 4/19/2009, I was at the MSY Airport at the break of dawn and it had stopped raining I wanted to capture aircraft taking off so I pointed my camera towards the airport to capture the morning sky. I took a series of five or six photos examined them as I took them I noticed 3 dots on the film plane that looked like specs in a sort of a triangle formation. I took a few more shots and got a closer look at what appears to be 4 shapes moving at a high rate of speed over the far end of the airport. While I was viewing the seen with my eyes none of these objects were visible. ((NUFORC Note:  Object may be clouds or birds, we believe.  Probably not UFO's, but we cannot be certain.  We spoke with the witness, and found him to be quite sincere.  PD));29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
