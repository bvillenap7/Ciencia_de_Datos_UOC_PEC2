Th;1996-06-01 21:00:00;15-20 seconds;While a conversation with a friend a large mirror like objesct came out of the south west sky traveling at a moderate rate of speed.  This object resembled liquid mercury traveling without sound and as large as the catholic church directly under it.  The object changed in shape from either rolling or changing course from S/W to a due North heading.  It then took off at a high rate of speed within seconds it went from the size of the church to a dot then disappeared into the night sky.  This was no type of earthly craft and completely silent with a trail of light following in its path.  I ran into my home and called NOAA asking if they had any information(radar) or reports concerning this hugh object.

This thing looked like a stare and then something elses cant say just what elese just something strange;2005-04-03 13:50:00;15 mins;This thing looked like a stare and then something elses cant say just what elese just something strange I am an Air Conditioing Contractor. We were on a flat roof changing out several Air Conditioning Systems. I went down my ladder to get a tool off of my truck and started back to the ladder.  After climbing a few steps up the ladder I spoted something that I knew was not normal, so when I got to the top of my ladder I called out to my nephew and brother  What's That they both turned to look where I was pointing.  Then I rememberd that I had my Kodak EasyShare DX4900 Digtal 4.0 MEGA PIXELS camera, so I started back down the ladder to get it out of my truck where I just had placed it from taking photos of our work for the web page.  I tell you what, this thing was standing still just hovering over us untill I started taking photos at which time it started to move away and starting climbing higher, I know this thing knew I was taking photos of it. It looked like a stare then it looked like something else not sure what shape to call it but it was changing all the time we were looking at it, but most of the time it looked like a star really bright at times and then not so bright I managed to take 3 photos of this thing before it got out of sight.  What a day;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
