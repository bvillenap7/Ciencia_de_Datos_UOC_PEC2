My husband and I stopped early one morning on a highway to look at a bright object, the object was a large round  silver thing.;1973-03-13 04:00:00;approx. 2hrs.;My husband and I stopped early one morning on a highway to look at a bright object, the object was a large round  silver thing. My husband at the time, and I were coming from Florida on one of our visits home.  We were driving from New Orleans over the spillway around 4AM.  There was no traffic at that time.  We both commented on how empty the roads were at that hour.  As we drove on we noticed a bright white light on the other side of the spillway (the higway is seperated and elevated).  We decided to stop as the light was so unusual and unexpected.  It seemed to be sitting in amongst the trees.  We got out of our car to get a better look and it dawned on both of us that there was no sound.  There were no frogs croaking, no bird sounds and no sound at all coming from whatever that thing was across from us.  It appeared to be silver and round.  It had large white lights at intervals all around it.  The lights shown down.  My husband and I stood looking at the thing in the dark just mesmerized.  Suddenly we were standing there and it was light.  I don't know how much time passed but when we first stopped it was dark and around 4:30 or so.  It was now light and about 5:30 or 6AM.  My husband and I both just looked at each other and almost together we said let's get out of here and we did.  We never talked about that.  Every so often I would bring it up but he never really wanted to talk about it.  I've told friends about it when talk of UFO's come up.  I always say that I believe in them because I saw one.  Maybe even went into it but have no memory of it.  My ex-husband is an MD and I am a student now, going back to school to hopefully get my law degree after being out over 20 years.  I have nothing to gain by telling this story.  I just believe that what we saw was a UFO.  It doesn't scare me.  I don't have nightmares and I've never had such a thing happen again.

I saw what I saw;2008-01-08 01:30:00;1 minute;I saw what I saw I DROVE TO THE CORNER OF THE STREET AND WAS WAITING FOR A CAR TO PASS WHEN I SAW A GREY/SILVER looking round object that looked like it had dents on it and ice (it looked smokey like hot ice but not like in the movies. There was no blinding lights like what people say, it didn't look clean and shiney either. It moved very slow and was about 2 and 3 stories high in the air and there was a sound that came from it(like a radio wave sound). It was about 60 feet from my car. It came over a house, it moved about 5mph and move to the middle of the street and stopped( it was facing me).It scared the heck out of me and I wasn't going waiting around to find out was else was going to happen. I took of quickly and called my husband and and asked him to go out and tell me what he saw. He said that there was nothing out there but that entire weekend choppers flew in the skys all day. Before then they were not doing that. That night and the entire weekend (at night)there w! as a light that would turn different colors but it was was still directly even with our street. I am a business owner dont want to be contacted so please don't contact me. I just wanted to say what I saw. No one can tell me that I didn't see what I cleaarly saw with my own two eye.

15 orange glowing objects, triangle inside a circle, silently moving over New Orleans.;2013-05-26 22:50:00;35 minutes;15 orange glowing objects, triangle inside a circle, silently moving over New Orleans Noticed unidentified moving light rising from the horizon in the southeast just to the left of the rising moon (about 1 hour after rising).  The object moved across the sky at a steady pace and in a direct path toward the opposite horizon.  When it was directly overhead, another appeared rising from the same spot just to the left of the moon.  This continued until we had seen 15 objects between 22:50 to 23:25 pm Central time.   After we saw the sixth one, I began snapping photos and taking videos with both my iphone and my pocket Leica.  To the naked eye, from afar, the objects appeared as a tiny white light, but as they got closer they appeared as a shimmering orange light and I thought I could see a definite circumference of either a circle or a triangle.   In one of the videos, I can hear myself say, “it looks like a triangle with rounded corners inside of a circle”.   The objects never moved “in formation”, changed direction or speed.  They just moved steadi! ly across the sky one after the other in exactly the same path as the one before and all were completely silent.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Two circular lights shoot across the might sky.;2015-08-02 22:00:00;10 minutes;Two circular lights shoot across the might sky. Was outside in backyard smoking cigarette and there was a huge party going on as I could hear it.  All of a sudden I happened to look up and I saw two circles of light (size hard to tell) thought it was a laser or a searchlight coming from the party.  But as it moved away I could see there was no tail indicating it was not be projected upwards, then it just disappeared.

Daytime contact with an UFO.;2015-08-08 10:00:00;20 minutes;Daytime contact with an UFO I was in the Coast Guard in New Orleans in 1980.  I was stationed at the Coast Guard base on the industrial canal.  It was a Sunday and I had watch.  My watch included walking to the docks and ensuring the vessels were properly tied off. I had the 0800-1200 watch.  The weather was clear with no visible cloud deck, the temperature was 70-80 degrees.  While I was walking on the dock, I stopped and talked to two other coast guardsmen who I had known from Bootcamp.  One was fishing around the docks and the other was going to relieve me in the next hour or so.  While we were standing there talking I noticed a slight line in the sky approximately 20 yards away and a 50 degree angle south.  I focused on the line and realized it was a small (4-5 foot diameter) disc rotating.  The bottom and of the disc was the same color as the sky.  The top of the disc during a slight uneven rotation was dark.  The line was the slight uneven rotation appearing like a line. I pointed to the object and offered simple orientation verbiage until both of the other men saw the object.  For the first two or three minutes we stood and stared. I asked the men to describe the object in as much details as they could.  The object was within 20 yards of our location and clearly visible.  In fact I commented that if I had a sidearm, I could easily shoot it.  There appeared to be small circular deviations in the surface below the center of the widest part of the diameter.  We discussed the lack of sound, vapors, lights or purpose for the small circles.  We discussed the possible propulsion system and observed no evidence to indicate a source. At that time I begin to use common aircraft taxiing signals to attempt to communicate with the object.  The airplane signals were not responded to however, when I started using helicopter signals the object would respond by descending in small movements to the landing signal.  At that time we observed the upper portion of the object was dark in color similar to the color of the water.  I attempted other common movements including pointing, waving and signal the object to come closer without response. According the one of the men, we had at that time engaged the object for 15-16 minutes and the only response had occurred from the helicopter signals.  I moved closer to the object until I was at the end of the dock and my position was approximately 10 yards from the object and it was at about 75 degrees.  I continued to describe the physical characteristics of the object. When the two other men moved toward the end of the dock, the object moved rapidly to the west until it disappeared.  We used dead reckoning and all measurements in angle or degrees are approximate. We report the incident to the Watch Commander and met with an officer from the Air Force.  He listened to our statements and advised us “to forget about it because by the time we were debriefed we wouldn’t know our own family.”  This is a discrete incident and I have conveyed the complete event.

Object in the clear blue sky;2016-01-29 14:24:00;02 minutes;Object in the clear blue sky I was taking photos of the clear blue sky from a chair on my porch.  I noticed a round object in the photos that appeared to have changed location in subsequent photos.  The object then went far in to the distance of the last photo and faded away.  When I zoom in to the photos the object appears to have a distinct shape and lines on it.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Orange globe shot out the top of the cloud.;2016-06-17 21:30:00;5 seconds;I was video taping strange lighting in a cloud, when I pulled the phone down and looked with naked eye, that's when a orange globe shot out the top of the cloud.  It was in Chalmete area.   January 10/20/16, I saw the same orb maybe 500 feet in air.  They both moved very fast in odd ways.  That's how I know they are  ufos;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
