Two Saucer Shape U.F.O.'s over New Orleans East.;1974-11-13 22:00:00;25 secounds;Two Saucer Shape U.F.O.'s  over New Orleans East. Two flying saucer shape craft flew just feet above the roof top of our home, if I was standing on the roof I could have touch them.   They  were moving very slow and were grayish silver in color with black centers underneath. They made no noise, had no lights and ships flew side by side.  My husband and I walk right beneath them as they came over the house and down the long driveway to we got to the road.  As the U.F.O.'s moved over the street they turned southward facing the Lake Pontchartrain, still side by side they took off at a great deal of speed.  I went inside and called the air base to report it. In the past two weeks I have been seeing U.F.O.'s and may have had a close contact.  On 10/31/1974 after seeing a strange object fly over our house, my husband and I lost about two hours.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803

Our route took us directly over Biloxi, Mississippi and then over the Gulf of Mexico.  This took us over the Gulf just south of New Orleans.  As we passed by Biloxi I picked up a very strong radar return about 100 miles in front of our plane directly in our path.  It appeared to be a very small but powerful thunderstorm so I didn't pay much attention to it.  As we approached the radar return New Orleans Air Traffic Control Center called to ask we could see something directly in front of us.  I replied we had a small but strong thunderstorm and asked to deviate to the left of the return, still assuming it was a compact but powerful storm.  We made our turn to pass just to the left of the return.  As we got within a half-mile of the radar return it completely disappeared.  It was there during one sweep of the radar and gone the next.  The lights from New Orleans were very bright and I could see clearly towards the city.  There weren't any clouds at all, much less a thunderstorm as we flew by the spot where the return had been.  Unfortunately, I was distracted at that time and didn't give any more thought to what had happened, although it was very strange.  It was a few years later that I suddenly thought about what had happened and that it may have some significance.  I would like to have contacted New Orelans ATC to see if the controller that was on duty that night was still available but too much time had passed.  This is my 2nd and final report of sightings during 45 years and 20,000+ hours flying.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Clear image of saucer in photo;2004-04-06 10:00:00;unknown;Clear image of saucer in photo I was a visitor to New Orleans for the 1st time taking pictures, we had taken a picture of Cafe Monet, and then a picture across the street of Jackson Square, thinking it was very beautiful. When we returned home and looked at the pictures from our trip, I discovered a bright silver object in the photo, it appeared just over the building in Jackson Square, but to the right. I took out a magnifying glass to get a better image and it appeared to have a slight dome on the perfect dome with a protrusions below it. The photo is very clear, but we never saw the object before and during the picture.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
