Large Triangle UFO Over French Quarter New Orleans Hovers, Then Vanishes Into Sky With Picture;2012-07-19 06:30:00;30 seconds;Large Triangle UFO Over French Quarter New Orleans Hovers, Then Vanishes Into Sky With Picture http://i.imgur.com/EDlNN.jpg  Whats in that picture is the craft flying away from Me. Within a couple seconds it went from about 1,000 feet up to what looks like about 4-5,000 feet up. Walking through the French Quarter at about 6:30 am,  I looked up saw/ heard a passenger jet fly over. I recognized its shape and saw its blinking navigation lights immediately as i have seen many hundreds of air craft before it.  I've always been able to identify every single craft i've ever witnessed in the air. I'm an air force brat, born and raised spent my life studying jets, planes and all things in the air. Plus 'always known about UFOs, seen pictures, heard stories been a fan of Science Fiction since i was old enough to read & about the universe at large.  What happened yesterday morning was nothing like i've ever seen or even thought i would ever see. It was like something out of Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, accept real and in person. I was confused at first because i didn't recognize the color of the bright lights, heard no sound and couldn't actually see the shape of the craft.  It's as tho the lights were deliberately being shined at me. It looked like very, very bright, orange headlights at first on a slow moving helicopter that hovered to a stop in the middle of my point of view. It was in the middle of the street about 1 mile away and about 500-1000 feet up.  It came to a stop when i stopped in the middle of the street. I looked at it and thought &quotwhat is that ?&quot  The shape of the air craft was obscured  due to the practically blinding brightness of the orange lights.  Now, It reminded me of the feeling of being under a spotlight.  The same light in your eyes a DJ person on stage might feel. It was briefly a blinding light. After a couple seconds of trying to see the shape of the craft, it looked like it was fading and going up into the sky so i grabbed my camera took the photo and it was gone. The craft was low enough to look like some kind of big hovering mass i couldn't even tell what shape it was due to the brightness of the light shining on me as tho i was under an extremely bright spotlight.  I grabbed the camera too the pic and it vanished. Sorry gentleman, something extraordinary and life changing has happened to me. Yesterday i experienced what i've explained here.  Something wonderful, unexplainable and ... after some thought, something i was ready for.  I've been preparing since i was old enough to read. You see those three lights in the picture ? I've just told you where they came from, what it looked like up close as they shined a laser or spotlight on me and that's what it looks like as it speeds away into the sky at about 10,000 miles an hour. I'm an artist and musician who is creative in many ways, however i'm not creative nor skilled enough to make this up.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Two very high altitude craft bright white color, glowing or reflecting sunlight.;2012-09-14 11:00:00;2 minutes;Two very high altitude craft bright white color, glowing or reflecting sunlight. While observing two high altitude passenger jets (with contrails) passing overhead. I caught view of two glowing or reflecting craft heading into the East.  They were at very high altitude moving very fast and the distance between the two changed as it appeared one of the craft accelerated. The two craft did not appear to be fighter jets and they left no contrails.  At first I thought they were seagulls, then I thought...two weather balloons.  After a longer look I felt that they were controlled craft. They disappeared behind cloud cover and did not reappear.  This is my second sighting in 30+ years of unusual craft and it was exciting to see.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803

3 Flashing White Lights and 1 Flashing Red Light in Triangular Formation - West Riverside  ((anonymous));2016-04-26 23:11:00;20-30 seconds;3 Flashing White Lights and 1 Flashing Red Light in Triangular Formation - West Riverside I was in my meditation room with the lights dimmed facing two windows.  I was looking down, when something caught my eye, causing me to look up to the window.  I saw three bright flashing lights in a triangular pattern with one flashing red light up towards the apex of the triangle which seemed unusually close as I peered outside of my window.   At first, I thought it was a plane, but then I quickly saw that it was not, that it was a perfect triangle and that there was something very peculiar about this craft.  After it flew out of my view, I immediately ran to the adjacent bedroom to see if I could see it out of that window.  I could not, so I grabbed a pen and paper to draw what I saw, as I did so I looked at my phone and saw that it was 11:11.  The craft was flying southeast towards the Mississippi River.   After the incident, I thought I heard some electricity sounding noises, like static and beeps, but I just figured it was the air conditioner.  The air seemed electric after the incident, like there was more static electricity in the air. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
