south to north movement, possiblt light reflected from the sun, it appeared to be rotating like on an axis.;2002-10-19 08:45:00;2min;south to north movement, possiblt light reflected from the sun, it appeared to be rotating like on an axis. at the university of new orleans. 75-80 degrees from directly up(90 degrees) and to the west. this aircraft was travelling from south to north. the sky had alot of clouds, white clouds and 'mostly cloudy'. what got my attention was that it appeared to me to be rotating as it was moving to the north. every few seconds it appeared that the sun would reflect and the object would 'light up', then it would return to a possibly metallic color. i don't see many aircraft travelling over new orleans in a south to north path. this object was travelling fast, faster than i think 'normal' aircraft travel. as it would go behind some clouds i would try to project the next place i would seee it. the object each time would get there faster than i had expected.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Large pulsating (5sec) white light in sky above New Orleans for 20+ min.;2014-06-29 02:00:00;20+ minutes;Large pulsating (5sec) white light in sky above New Orleans for 20+ min. A friend and I saw a white light in the sky directly overhead as I was leaving her house tonight, around 2:40AM in New Orleans, La, June 29, 2014.  It appeared to be holding a position for 5-10 minutes just above a cloud layer that obscured most of the stars, and could not have been more than a few miles above the ground.  The object appeared to be roughly the size of a house (but I’m normally not a great judge of size at such a distance).  I can say for sure, though, that it was either extremely large, or very close, as in, incomparably larger than the perceived size of a star at my distance.  I should also make clear that we never saw its contours--we only saw the light coming through the dark cloud layer that created the almost starless night, tonight.  It quickly faded to full brightness and back to darkness (as opposed to blinking) periodically, every 5 seconds, the entire time it was in-sight. I sent my friend to retrieve her point and shoot camera, hoping it would have better light sensitivity than my iPhone 5S, but as soon as she returned, the light disappeared. We stared for another 2-3 minutes and it did not return.  Before finally leaving, I walked back inside to attempt to see if anyone had spoken with the New Orleans Police Department, but no one answered their non-emergency line.  After about 20 minutes of that and speaking with my friend about the occurrence, I stepped back outside to leave.  The light was back.  This time, it appeared just to the right of the same pair of stars it had appeared near earlier.  I ran back inside to grab my friend and we watched it pulsate for another several minutes, attempting to video tape, but the light was too faint for the camera.  This time, the light appeared to be moving away and then towards us. I thought I saw a flash or two from possible neighboring objects, but it was so faint that I can’t tell for sure.  My friend als! o claimed that the light was faintly tinted blue, and I may have caught that once or twice, as well, but once again, I can’t tell for sure. After a good bit of thought, the following are the points that stand out to me:   1.	  I have only ever seen a combination of red and white lights coming from man-operated aircraft. The fact that this light was purely white is interesting to me. 2. 	The regularity of the pulsating of the light (5 seconds between ON states. For whatever reason, this made me lean towards “man-made.” But, who knows?)  3.	  The size and proximity. My friend suggested that it could be a satellite, but I don’t think it could be so close or so big. I will research the likelihood of this as soon as I’m done filing this report. 4.	  The fact that the object “disappeared” and “returned.” I believe it’s possible that there were multiple thin layers of obscuring clouds, and that enough finally came between us and the object that it was finally obscured completely. Thinking in these terms, its return was simply those clouds continuing past the object. From this, one may conclude that it disappeared and reappeared, or that it never left. From this, one might also infer that it was moving slowy the whole time and was not exactly static as implied in the first paragraph of this report. 5.	  UPDATE: 4:38AM, CURRENT TIME: Said friend just called and said someone walked into her back door (that she negligently left unlocked). She believes she say a T-shirt, so we’ll assume he was human. This most likely has no connection to the white light, but I thought I’d mention it. 6.	  Apparently, the International Space Station has just passed over us, but that was the evening before this one, Friday June 27 2014 at 8:41PM:  http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=United_States&region=Louisiana&city=New_Orleans#.U6_1aY1dVH0 a.	  Also, the ISS is described as having a constant white light, and specifically not a flashing light, from the two articles I’ve read on it. That is all!  Decide for yourself!;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
A bright bluish white object shot downward over New Orleans.;2014-07-12 21:25:00;2 seconds;A bright bluish white object shot downward over New Orleans. Gf and I were sitting on the porch when a bright bluish white object passed over the house like a shooting star would.  The object was traveling very fast and looked to be heading straight to the ground on a downward angle...   Never seen anything like it before...  It was too big to be a shooting star and too visible but to bright at the same time...  Happened at exactly 9:25;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Violet light seen zig-zagging quickly across night sky.;2014-07-28 22:00:00;1 minute;Violet light seen zig-zagging quickly across night sky I was sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette around 10PM, near Children's Hospital, looking south in the direction of the Mississippi River.   I was looking at the sky, when between two houses, I saw a violet/pink light appear.  The light was small, appearing as though it was far off in the distance.   The light would stay in one location for several seconds, zoom quickly in zig-zag fashion to another location, hover for several seconds, and so on.   It would occasionally dart behind a house where I could not see it, but then reappear within view and continue to dart and hover in different spots in the sky.   It moved quickly and unsteadily, very much unlike any normal aircraft that I have seen.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
Orange Fire Like Orbs Flying Across Mississippi River.;2020-03-05 21:30:00;3 minutes;Orange Fire Like Orbs Flying Across Mississippi River. Multiple Orange Orbs  On 3/5/2020, at about 9:30PM, there were 4 orange orbs floating in a slightly uniform square shaped formation. It seemed as if it were something on fire.  There was no visible smoke being emitted from the orbs.  It was silent when it flew overhead. It slowly faded and disappeared.  As the first four orbs started to fade, another single orb flew from across the Mississippi River, in the same direction.  Then another orb flew from across the river in the same path as the orb before it a total of about an additional 6 orbs flew across the sky.  The orbs faded into existence and then faded away.  There was no crafts in the river, and nothing unusual on the other side that I could see that would indicate where the orbs were coming from or if anything was producing them in the sky.;29.9672233791748;-90.0808817288803
