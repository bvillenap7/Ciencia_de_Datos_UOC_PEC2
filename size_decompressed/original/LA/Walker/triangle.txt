It never moved, it just sat stationary.  It was shaped in a V with lights on each of the 3 points.   We watched it trying to figure out what it was.  We rolled the window down, but it made no noise at all!!  Then as we are staring at this object, it simply disappears.  It's like it faded away.  Never moved, just faded away.  Then my mother in law saw it up close this evening around 19:30.  It was near the same spot but closer to the ground than before.  She said it was the same shape as what we saw 2 days ago and it was silver with a black stripe down the middle.  The only difference was she saw a very bright beam of light.;30.5232;-90.8518
Large Triangular UFO Spotted Moving Slowly Over Louisiana Town.;2020-06-28 20:35:00;2 minutes;Large Triangular UFO Spotted Moving Slowly Over Louisiana Town. A UFO was spotted shortly after 8:30 PM at the intersection of Arnold Road (LA 1025) and Duff Road, being fairly large in a triangular shape, with 3 white lights on each point of the triangle, and one red light directly in the middle.  The craft moved backwards it seemed, on a flat side instead of a point.  The lights stayed a solid color as the craft moved northwest, emitting no noise.  It appeared to bank right slowly as it moved off into the clouds.  Only one large craft was observed.  Both observers were in a car traveling along the highway when it was spotted, and pulled off to witness the craft.;30.5232;-90.8518
