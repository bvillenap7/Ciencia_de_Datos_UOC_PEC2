3 DIM AMBER LIGHTS FIXED ON LARGE OBJECT AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED;2008-03-09 22:30:00;3 SECONDS;3 DIM AMBER LIGHTS FIXED ON LARGE OBJECT AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED FACING EAST 3 DIM AMBER LIGHTS APPROXMATELY 800-1200 FEET MOVING SOUTH TO NORTH AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE LIGHTS WERE FIXED ON THE REAR OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A 60 YARD WIDE OBJECT. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND AND THE OBJECT MOVED AS IF IT SLICED THROUGH THE AIR. THERE WAS NOT A  TRAIL BEHIND THE OBJECT. WHEN IT REACHED THE END OF MY LINE OF SIGHT IT LOOKED TO BANK TO THE EAST AWAY FROM ME. THEN IT WAS GONE. I CALLED THE LOCAL SHERIFF DEPT AND MADE A REPORT. I WAS IN THE MILITARY AND WENT THROUGH OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING THAT SIZE MOVE AT THAT RATE OF SPEED WITH NO SOUND AT ALL.THE BACKGROUND WAS A CLEAR NIGHT WITH NO WIND.;30.5232;-90.8518
Red and green light craft over Walker, Louisiana for several days now.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2017-02-03 21:30:00;still present;Rred and green light craft over Walker, Louisiana for several days now. Red and green light craft hovering in in the south, south west sky.  Has been there for the past couple of nights. watched for approximately one and a half hours on an off last night until it finally flew towards the southeast out of sight.  Noticed it again tonight at around 2130 and at 2220 is still visible to the south. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));30.5232;-90.8518
Astrophotographer sees 5 dim orangish lights travel across the sky  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-24 02:00:00;2 minutes;Astrophotographer sees 5 dim orangish lights travel across the sky while imaging. I’m an amateur astrophotographer. I had just set up for another round of exposures on the Orion Nebula. I had stepped back from my imaging rig while it ran and was viewing Orion with a smaller hand held refractor. 5 relatively dim lights in an almost straight line passed into the view of my scope. It was odd, so I tracked it by hand all the way to the horizon where I lost sight of it. I spend at least a couple nights a week imaging deep sky objects. I’m used to seeing planes, satellites, meteors, and other normal things. This one was different. The lights were too dim to be a  normal plane, way dimmer than stars.  They were dim, but seemed large, like they were closer than a satellite would be.  They would have been too dim to see with the naked eye though.  They were not in a perfectly straight line, but stayed the same distance from each other. So I’m assuming they were part of the same object.  All five lights were the same size, shape, and brightness.  I woul! d describe them as a really dim orange or brown color. They traveled across the sky about as fast as a plane would. I am aware of Elon musk’s star link satellites, but I’m pretty sure that isn’t what I saw. I don’t particularly believe in “alien” ufo’s, but I’m not sure what this was and I could not find something that matched what I saw.;30.5232;-90.8518
