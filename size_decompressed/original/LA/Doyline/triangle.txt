TRIANGLER CRAFT NEAR BARKSDALE;1996-02-01 15:00:00;3 minutes;TRIANGLER CRAFT NEAR BARKSDALE ONE NIGHT I SAW SOMETHING THAT I'LL NEVER FORGET.  MY WIFE AND I WERE DRIVING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD SURROUNDED IRONICALLY BY COW PASTURES.  OFF TO MY RIGHT A PRETTY FAIR  DISTANCE I NOTICED A SET OF LIGHTS FROM A AIRCRAFT WHILE TALKING TO MY WIFE.   THE FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME WAS NO BLINKING LIGHTS SO I BECAME ALMOST DRAWED TO IT.   UNABLE TO REALLY EXPLAIN WHY , I SLOWED THE CAR FIRST THEN I NOTICED ITS TRAJECTORY WAS NO LONGER PARRALLEL BUT WAS COMING CLOSER.   I STOPPED THE CAR TO WATCH IT FLY ABOUT 100-150 FT ABOVE THEN OVER ME.   I NOTICED THERE WAS A HUGE ABSCENCE OF SOUND FROM A CRAFT JUST OVERHEAD AND THE LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM WERE STRANGE.   THE MOON AND THE LIGHT PLACEMENT OF THE CRAFT SHOWED ITS TRIANGLER SHAPE  WELL.  EMBARASSED TO SAY, I SPED OFF NERVOUS AS HELL.   I LIVED CLOSE TO BARKSDALE AIRFORCE BASE SO I DONT KNOW.

four people witness triangle shaped craft;2007-09-07 20:15:00;20 seconds;four people witness triangle shaped craft I received a phone call tonight from my son in north Louisiana. He called to tell me that his wife, who saw a tour in Iraq, had left earlier to go see her parents.  He said she called to tell him that as she was nearing the parents house, that she and their three children, who were also in the car, saw a triangle shapped craft just above the tree lines.  The craft had 3 distingushed bright lights.  The craft hovered and did not move.  As they saw it, they slowed while other cars continued along the highway. They turned the car around to get a better look and the craft was gone.;32.4894;-93.4022
