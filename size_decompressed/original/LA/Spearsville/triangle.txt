3 slowly moving objects in a triangle form.;2009-02-05 21:23:00;About 6 minutes;3 slowly moving objects in a triangle form. So I was walking my friend out to the car and I was on my way back to the porch when I noticed 3 lights in the sky in a perfect triangle form.  I thought it was just bright stars at first but when I watched them closely, I noticed they where moving closer and closer slowly. So I sat there and watched them until all of a sudden 1 disappears.  A few minutes later another one disappears.  And finally as the last one got close enough, I could see 2 small lights spinning around the big one.  But as soon as I saw that it kind of faded away very fast and shot off in the opposite direction as it faded and disappeared.  I didnâ€™t know what to think because it was the first time I ever saw anything like that.;32.953;-92.5859
