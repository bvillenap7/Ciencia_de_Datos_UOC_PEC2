The craft had a triangular shaped silhouette woth an unusual lighting pattern on the bottom and to the rear.  This pattern of lights were mostly red and green and flickered across as if they were blinking on in sequence.  This craft was also almost silent and did not make the usual jet or airline sounds I normally hear. This craft was probably about 10 to 15 thousand feet up and flew about two to three times the velocity of a normal airline jet.  I have never seen anything like it before.;32.5258013071895;-92.0799346405228
