It first made me think of a comet but it had no tail following it and it stopped in mid flight and blinked out, then it reappeared and got really bright (Venus was is the sky behind me, so I know it wasn't it,but it looked like it) it moved slowly across the sky, very low ! It moved slowly up and it was kind of blinking and as I watched it went out completely. I never looked away or even blinked my eyes!! It was not a plane changing directions or anything that I have ever seen before. It made me uncomfortable enough that as soon as it disappeared  I felt scared and ran into my house. the object I saw was a ball of light with a fog or haze around it , it seemed to fly silently and low to the ground, it had no tail or trail behind it. It stopped , hovered and then blinked out only to reappear in the same spot where it stayed still and became brighter than it had been at first then it moved very slow sort of blinking , bright to almost out, then after about 10 seconds it blinked out completely. It was the size of  a Basketball when it first flew over me then when it blinked out and came back it was the size of Venus, only it no longer had the haze around it.;32.5258013071895;-92.0799346405228

I saw nothing, but the camera saw differently;2007-06-19 20:54:00;Only Seconds;I saw nothing, but the camera saw differently I was sitting outside on the evening of June 19 observing the moon and Venus.  I thought a picture of this would be nice because they were so outstanding in the night sky.  I went into the house to get my camera (SONY DCS585).  I did not have the camera set on night vision, so the pictures I took are really dark.  I downloaded them and brightened them.  To my amazement, all kinds of objects showed on the screen.  I DID NOT see any of these images while observing the night sky. The sequence of the picture numbers are 02133, 02134 and 02136.  02135 showed nothing out of the ordinary.  The time I took the pictures is from 8:54-8:55pm CT (which is in the property of the picture information). The only changes that were made was to enhance the images and enlarge a red orb to see it better.  I have all the original pictures still in my camera.  I am sending these to you through email so that you might take a look at them.  Again, I saw nothing and heard nothing.  I am a college graduate with a BS degree in Sociology and English.  I work from home building web sites. I do believe that there are others out there from experiences I had as a child and other anomalies that I have witnessed.

Me and my brother took my mom to the hospital, after awhile I decided to wait in the car.  Not long afterward I seen this craft which can only be described as light, fly over the hospital, and was small and brighter than a star.  It was moveing bounceing around for about a minute than disappeared.  Note I had a good view, and it was hovering right over the emergency room part of the hospital.
