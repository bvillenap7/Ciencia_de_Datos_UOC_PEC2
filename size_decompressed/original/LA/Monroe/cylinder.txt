Glowing green rocket-shaped object with a tail of fire.;2004-07-07 21:05:00;3 SECONDS;Glowing green rocket-shaped object with a tail of fire. I was heading to work on Interstate 20 West near Bayou Lafourche. Just after a car passed, a glowing, green, rocket-shaped object caught my attention. It was at about a thirty degree angle directly in front of me. There were no obstructions to my vision. As quickly as I fixed my eyes on it, the object appeared to gain speed and change in color from green to a bright orange. At this point, a tail of what appeared to be fire developed. The tail glowed momentarily in a long strand and then faded out. This object was travelling out of the south, and appeared to be on a course to strike the ground a couple of miles to the east of the Monroe airport. I kept waiting for an explosion, but none came, so I cannot say without a doubt that it landed. I have been using this same route to work for ten years. I consider myself a rational person, and do not necessarily believe in UFO's. But I can't explain what I saw.;32.5258013071895;-92.0799346405228
