Bright Silvery White Traingular UFO;2005-06-27 21:10:00;10 seconds;Bright Silvery White Traingular UFO I was driving with my daughter, her boyfriend, and my son home from going to the store. We were in our subdivision and as I turned the corner onto one of our streets I saw out of my driverside window a solid triangular shaped object about 24-48 feet about the treetops over several houses. It was low enough that I could see without any doubt what it was. It was hovering but not stationary. It was illuminated with a bright silvery white light and a bright blue aura. The object was triangular but instead of the corners being pointed they were rounded. I yelled at the kids and my daughter looked and saw it and screamed. THe object then sped up and flew west over the treetops and up into the sky. It made no sound and there was no movement from the tops of the trees. The light was so bright that it made it possible to see the object clearly. There were no markings or windows. It appeared solid almost like aluminum but even smoother. As we drove down the street trying to keep up with it it continued to fly higher and west. There is no doubt whatsoever as to what we saw. I have never in my life see something like this. I am a nurse and I never imagined something like this existed. It was low enough that we saw exactly what it was.;30.2162076530612;-93.2027030612244
