Bright object high alt. travels from A to B in 10sec. from B to C in 10sec.  Total travel time 3-5 min. read report for details.;2008-07-22 23:00:00;8 minutes;Bright object high alt. travels from A to B in 10sec. from B to C in 10sec.  Total travel time 3-5 min. read report for details. I was looking at a formation of stars that seemed to be in a perfectly straight line for quite some time.  After looking at the stars for a while (they were in the southern portion of the sky) a bright circular light appeared from absolute darkness.  The light started out (Point A) as bright as the brightest star in my field of vision.  The light traveled for about 10 seconds and decreased in brightness towards (Point B) until it vanished into complete darkness.  I was amazed by the disappearing of this light and assumed it was a meteor traveling horizontally across my field of vision.  I gazed at the exact spot in which the light disappeared for roughly around 3-5 minutes.  After 3-5 minutes the light appeared again and began traveling horizontally across the sky to (Point C) the final destination.  The same intensity and decrease in brightness occurred from (Point B) to (Point C).  The lights were not flickering or flashing as a commercial airline or other jet/helicopter would have been.  I've seen commercial  airliners approaching landing and seen a spotlight similar to intensity, but this light was not flashing or flickering, nor was it low enough to have its landing spotlight on.  This object appeared to be several thousands of miles in the night sky and did not flicker or scatter, it merely appeared and decreased in brightness until it disappeared and then reappeared again.  From Point A to Point C the lights flight took anywhere from 3-5 minutes.  From Point A to Point B the light only took 10 seconds to travel.  From Point B to Point C was also another 10 seconds.  Now this would make the total flight from Point A to Point C take 20 seconds, but the kicker is that the light disappeared for quite some time and reappeared making the total flight time anywhere from 3-5 minutes.  I spent another half and hour gazing at the sky hoping to see more commotion but did not find any other abnormalities.;30.2162076530612;-93.2027030612244
white cirlce of light suudently appears;2008-08-15 22:30:00;10 seconds;white cirlce of light suudently appears This is an odd sighting.   This was July or August 2008 and I was sitting on my patio about 10:30 pm local time looking at the night sky and viewing to the northeast.  I saw immediately a star sized light suddenly turn on and appear in the night sky. It slowly began to increase in size to a perfect white circle to about 2-3 times the size of a pea held at arms length.  It then stopped increasing in size and then blinked out.   Several seconds later I thought I saw a very faint dot move rapidly south from the position where I first saw this light.  This couldnâ€™t be a meter as no trial or sparks or other colors were seen with this light, it was a white perfect circle.  There were no other lights seen attached to it suggesting aircraft running lights or tail lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Object shrunk in size, and flew away at an amazing speed.;2012-06-16 04:20:00;2 to 4 seconds;Object shrunk in size, and flew away at an amazing speed. I went outside to smoke a cigarette, and a brighter than usual light in the sky caught my attention.  My initial thought was its an airplane, or a bright star.  The object then shrunk in size, and flew away at an amazing rate of speed, and out of sight.   About a half second later, I saw what looked like a shooting star.  I'm not sure if the shooting star was connected to the other object or not. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
