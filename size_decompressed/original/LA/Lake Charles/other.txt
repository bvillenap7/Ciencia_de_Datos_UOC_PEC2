long narrow silver rod seen;2008-04-24 17:05:00;1-2 seconds;long narrow silver rod seen This was seen just briefly one afternoon while driving home from work.  I was driving due south on a local street about 5 pm local time with perfectly clear blue sky.  I noticed a little to my right just a few degrees west of due south, just above the horizon, a shiny object.  This was no ordinary object.  It was long, very narrow, and silver, and standing up-right, and seemed to be somewhat pointed on each end, but it was hard to tell exactly because of the second or two that the sighting lasted. I thought it might have been a reflection, but I could also tell it was far away as I could compare it against other objects such as power lines, and telephone poles, and commercial buildings.  This has to be one of the oddest things I’ve seen, I don’t see too many of these reports shown on the web sites. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

Metal, hot air balloon shape with red light at bottom.;2014-07-02 19:30:00;1 minute;Metal, hot air balloon shape with red light at bottom. Me & my wife were heading home, when I noticed what I though was a balloon in the sky. Then I realized it was shiny like metal, really far in the sky (balloon would be hard to see at that distance), & it seemed to have a light at the bottom. Imagine a large hot air balloon shape, that is solid, with a large light shining red.  Then, we passed what I would guess to be directly under it, went forward driving, looking back to see it again.  We never saw it again nit was there 1 minute & gone the next.  So, either a very large, solid metal hot air balloon with a light at the bottom or something unexplained.;30.2162076530612;-93.2027030612244
