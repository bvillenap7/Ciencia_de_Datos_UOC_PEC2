I pulled into a parking lot - of the closed Paw Paws restaurant to wait for my father who was coming from Houston to meet me.  No other cars were around, however several passed by on Hwy 71 as I sat there.  It was just after noon and a clear blue sky day.  A silver-bluish chevron shaped craft of 5-7 feet in length appeared near the edge of the parking lot and swooped low over the parking lot, coming from a wooded area to the west of my car.   It came in low and passed within 20 feet of my car, dropped its speed as if to observe me, making a sharp turn.  It then zipped off at a higher speed, gaining altitude rapidly.   I have seen radio-control planes the color and shape of this craft but nothing that is capable of turns and changes in altitude like this ! It rapidly returned to the edge of the woods and vanished .
