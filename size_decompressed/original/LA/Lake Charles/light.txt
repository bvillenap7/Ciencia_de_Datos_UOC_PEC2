There was a UFO in Lake Charles, Louisiana in 2000.;2000-01-15 20:00:00;40 minutes;There was a UFO in Lake Charles, Louisiana, in 2000. On a winter night in 2000, I stepped outside my house and saw in the neighbor's goat pasture a lighted object that hovered up, down, and up again. I called to my wife who came immediately and saw the object just as it began moving east toward Lake Charles Municipal Airport. We got into our car and followed the object, which had to have been moving close to 100 miles per hour. I distinctly remember the object passing in front of an airplane descending onto the runway. Afterward, the object moved too quickly out of our range to keep up with it. The local television station, KPLC, reported that there had been multiple sightings. The next day, our newspaper, The American Press, reported that what people were seeing was a blimp with lights inside of the inflated part that was illuminating it. I was within three miles of the object and got no impression that it was a blimp, but I cannot say for certain what the object was.;30.2162076530612;-93.2027030612244

There were no strobe lights or other colored lights.  I was curious if it was a satilite, or an asteroid?  I didn't think satilites went north to south.  It was only visible for a few seconds, then it just vanished.  It didn't appear to be in the atmosphere, but further out in space.;30.2162076530612;-93.2027030612244

He describes that he was awakened one night, around 10:30 pm by his wife that asked him to come view what she was seeing outside.  They both described the object as a small light that was changing colors around its edge.  Binoculars were used to better identify the object.  It was round about like a pea at arms length, but had different colored lights around its edge that stock out on stems as he described it, resembling the shape of a tic, those little insects that dogs get when walking in the woods.   The object was to the north just to the right of due north and up about 20 degrees from the horizon, the next night the same object was seen again but slightly more to the right of the first sighting.;30.2162076530612;-93.2027030612244
