I was looking out my back door about 8:20 PM and I saw about 10 orange lights in the west southwest sky approximately 35-40 degrees high.  They  appeared to be moving south to north in a tight formation.   They seem to stop, and at that time I observed 3 more lights approaching from the  south, when I looked back for the group they were no longer there.   At that time 3 more appeared from the same area in the south as the original  groupings, one of these appeared to drop straight down, the remaining two moved north about 2 or 3 seconds then faded from view. They were slightly larger in size then Venus, steady bright reddish orange in color. I live in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which is 30.3 lat, 93.2 long..   Clear sky somewhat light poluted, since I live near downtown.;30.2162076530612;-93.2027030612244
3 orange lights in the Lake Charles, LA, sky.;2017-01-14 19:00:00;3 minutes;3 orange lights in the Lake Charles, LA, sky. I walked outside to let our dog ((dog's name deleted)) go to the bathroom and there they were just hovering, I'm guessing 2 or 3 miles away from me, bright orange in color.   I ran back inside and called for my wife to come see them and grabbed my camera, ran back out and got one shot off, and then whatever it was vanished!  Our dog ((dog's name deleted)) was going nuts, barking and then trying to get back into the house.;30.2162076530612;-93.2027030612244
