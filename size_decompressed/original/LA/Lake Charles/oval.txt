small silvery object blends into surrounding sky;2004-05-15 05:45:00;20 seconds;small silvery object blends into surrounding sky The day is approximate, probably an early spring morning and very clear with no clouds.  I walked outside to observe the sunrise and noticed a small silvery stationary object several miles up glistenig in the early morning sunrays..At first I thought it was a planet, but it was too large (slightly larger than a pin head held at arms length), then perhaps a weather ballon..however what got my attention was that as the sky became just a little brighter, the object rapidly lost its refelction and within 5-10 seconds totally disapperared from view.  It seemed to take on the same color as the surrounding clear blue sky, and could not be seen after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Brother came in from outdoors saying that there are flashing lights in the sky. Myself and another went outdoors to observe the lights in the sky and yes there were two clear sites of the flashing colorful lights moving rapidly.  Looking through binoculars, we could see the side way oval circle of flashing lights of red green n other colors moving swiftly in that particular area.  They were located in the North east skies.   We began to look to other area of the sky and spotted a few more.  We returned inside the house for about 40 minutes to an hour and went back outdoors to notice the objects had moved more over head in the sky and one of the objects had other seemingly flashing craft around it forming sort of a triangle.  We observed them for another 20 minutes or so and returned indoors.  What the heck were those objects we saw in the sky???;30.2162076530612;-93.2027030612244
