Unusal objects moving fast and quite over southwest Lousiana;2003-06-15 22:30:00;a few seconds;Unusal objects moving fast and quite over southwest Lousiana This object appeared on a clear night. The object was easily seen with the unaided eye moving exactly from east to west at a fairly fast clip it was out of my sight within a few seconds.  It was shaped cicular, white-grey coloring.  It had no lights, no wings, and no noise. There was no one else in my yard other than me observing this object. I would guess it was maybe 1000-1500 feet up? Lighted objects have also been recently reported on the local news over this area. I might also add that this same object or at least one similar was again observed by myself in the back yard around 10 pm local time in the month of Septemer of this year as I was seting up my telescope to observe Mars. That object had a definte black bottom and a whitish top, moving fast and quiet, exactly from north to south. It exhibited simlar charactistics in stucture and altitude as the first did.;30.2162076530612;-93.2027030612244
Disc seen with circular whiteish outter edge;2003-09-15 22:00:00;10 seconds;Disc seen with circular whiteish outter edge This is the second time I have submitted this report as I dont see it listed perhaps it did not go thru. In Septemebr of 2003 I was setting up my telescope to view Mars and noticed out of the corner of my eye something moving above the trees. I quickly turned and saw a craft, not a plane, bird, satellite, helicopter, or ballon. It was no more than 300 feet above me (a large 70 foot live oak tree is in my backyard that I used for reference) It was dark in color with a whitish canopy.  The craft was  2 or 3 times the trees height, and estimated to be about 75 feet across moving about 30-40 mph.  It flew above the tree and along the dividing line that separates my backyard and my neighbors backyard (my neighbors backyard abuts my backyard). The craft made no noise, had no lights, nor wings. Most decernible was a black circular bottom with a white circle on the outter edge of the botton disc, it reminded me of a white wall tire' as it flew quitley from north to south on a straight trajectory.  Oddly enough there is a high voltage station and accompanying high voltage lines down from me on my street and hight voltage lines along the street behind me, the craft seen traveling along the backyards seemed to be driving right between the two streets where the lines are located perhaps absorbing the energgy field?..Is this craft some type of new military technology? If its alien why not tell us it is alien?....;30.2162076530612;-93.2027030612244
