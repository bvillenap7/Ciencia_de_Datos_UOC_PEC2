Lights over Haughton/Bossiers Southwest and Northwest skys.;2012-04-11 11:10:00;25 minutes;Lights over Haughton/Bossiers Southwest and Northwest skys. I seen a very large bright light to the south west that was staying one place for over 10 minutes and then moving slowly to the left and then to the right.  Lots of air planes with their normal blinking lights racing across the sky in a large left banking circle headed at the light.  It got too far behind the trees to be seen any longer, I have seen many B52s and this wasn't one of them, I headed inside to find my wife in the backyard and then I spotted a closer very large bright orange light to the north west, I thought that it was a plane flying in my direction, but I have never seen a plane with a orange light like this.  It reminded me of the same color and brightness of a street light but miles up in the sky.   I watched it for 15 minutes,  It moved so slowly moving in a up and right direction I lost it behind a tree,  There was two planes or small jets flying from the east towards it.  I went back inside for awhile and checked the front and back and no sign of! them or the air traffic, very cloudy and a light chill in the air, both of which were not the case at the time of the event.;32.5497;-93.5642
