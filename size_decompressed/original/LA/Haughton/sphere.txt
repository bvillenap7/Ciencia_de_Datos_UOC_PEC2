Orange sphere trailing high flying jet;2011-11-16 21:00:00;1.5-2 minutes;Orange sphere trailing high flying jet Location N 32 33 36.54 W 93 34 28.26  Objects direction of travel was approximately 280 to 110 or WNW to ESE  Estimated elevation of jet aircraft and UFO:  35k-40k  I had stepped outside with my dogs when I observed a high flying jet aircraft about 10 degrees north of vertical from me. His ID and strobe lights were very obvious.  I then noticed a large orange glowing ball trailing the aircraft at a distance which I estimated to be 2-3 miles. My first thought was that there was an orbiting satellite above him, but then the ball maintained a steady distance behind the aircraft and was on the exact same flight path.  Also, a satellite in low orbit should have been out out of the sunlight by the time is was directly overhead and this object never lost any of its brilliance even after passing out of sight to the east.  It also appeared to maintain its spacing behind the aircraft. Saturn had been recently very prominent in our sky but was much smaller than this object and the color was much different. Saturn was bright and obviously a star or planet. The object trailing the aircraft was orange and appeared as though lit from inside.
