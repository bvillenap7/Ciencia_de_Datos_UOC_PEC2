As we reclined in our chairs looking up, I noticed a dim amberish solid light moving across the sky. It looked as though it was at a very high altitude, moving very fast. At one point in the sky, it changed direction, 90 degrees. As this light moved out of sight, I noticed another one. The second one was following the same path, but didn't make the 90 degree turn. The third moved across taking another path. As we were wondering what we were seeing, I noticed two other lights moving towards each other. When they moved closer to each other, they each made a half circle in opposite directions, as to avoid colliding. Then the two lights continued to move away from each other until out of site. There were no sounds associated with these lights. When I saw the two lights swirl away from each other, I got weak and shaky. It was very weird and shocking. I hope someone else witnessed this.;30.4687;-93.2378
