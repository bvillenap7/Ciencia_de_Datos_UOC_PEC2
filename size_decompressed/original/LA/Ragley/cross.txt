Cross Shaped object.  ((anonymous report));2017-01-27 22:00:00;Several seconds;Cross Shaped object My husband, who does not believe in UFO's at all, was out feeding the horses around 10:00 p.m.  He had finished and was standing facing north when something caught his eye.   At first he thought it was a large insect but it had a glow to it.  He rubbed his eyes thinking there was something in it.  The object hovered about 20 ft in the air in front of him and then zipped right above his head.  When he raised his head to look at it, the object made several zigzag motions and then zipped out of his sight into the woods next to our property.  The object made no sound at all.
