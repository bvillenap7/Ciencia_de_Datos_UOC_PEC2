I went outside to look it wasen't there of course. But they saw a white light accelerate towards the ground then stopped around 50 feet above the ground and accelerated back up to about 200 feet then it stopped turned on 2 bright white spot lights and started moving west from our house. After about 30 seconds of this it emitted a bright white light and disappeared. After looking around in the sky for more I happen to see about 10 flying north very far in the sky a little to the left of the moon. I was amazed! I stayed outside and kept searching for more and saw 1 here 1 there fliyng only north and south.  A little later my girlfriend was on her way to my house she lives about 30 miles north of me. I had told her about what happend and was even on the phone with her when i saw 1 flying alone. So she was searching the sky as she was on the way here and then looke! d to her left and saw a HUGE white disk shape and 2 jets a good ways away from it. It was about a mile or so in the air and she said it was about the size of a football field. I've seen a UFO before and researched it quite a bit but NEVER anything like this? 2 Ufos close to the ground? and multiple flying north and south?
