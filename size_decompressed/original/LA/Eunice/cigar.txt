The craft was bright blue and was longer than it was wide. It turned away from us and sped up and the light went out shortly there after. There was no sound  at all. There were also two planes going in the same direction shortly after we saw it disappear. We did speak out loud about it when we saw it and it was at that point that it turned away from us an disappeared. It was at about ten thousand feet and brighter than anything in the sky, it seemed to know we saw it and turned away.;30.4978;-92.3906
