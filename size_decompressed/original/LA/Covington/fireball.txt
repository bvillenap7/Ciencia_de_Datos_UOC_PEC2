fireball traveling over Interstate 12 in Louisiana;2004-06-07 22:00:00;5 seconds;fireball traveling over Interstate 12 in Louisiana As I was entering Interstate 12 near Covington, I saw a small fireball moving at what appeared to be traveling about 90 to 100 mph. It was going straight just above the treeline headed east. It was a fire/energy ball that was white and blue in color. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar report from Florida for same time and date.

5 red/orange color-pulsing balls of light seen over Covington, LA;2013-05-25 21:03:00;6 minutes;5 red/orange color-pulsing balls of light seen over Covington, LA We had seen this before in Baton Rouge, LA a few months ago.  When we saw two orange lights flying at the same speed and in the same direction, we pulled over to record it using an iPad camera.  We got out of the car and recorded it for 2 minutes and 25 seconds before I turned around to find 3 more behind us.  The second group of objects was closer to us than the first two.  They emitted no sound, and all flew at the same speed in some type of formation.  They moved far enough away that they finally vanished out of our sight.  They were originally moving NW at an unknown speed (it depends on how big they actually were), then finally seemed to move out of the atmosphere.;30.5074665865384;-90.1009867788453
