Orange balls in the sky over Louisiana;2014-05-10 23:25:00;3 minutes;Orange balls in the sky over Louisiana I am hessitant to report anything like this, because it just seems weird to say what I actually saw tonight.  I stepped on my back porch to smoke a cigarette, and noticed an orange sphere in the sky.  I thought why would someone be lighting a flare over a neighborhood, and then the second sphere came into my view and I thought flares don't move like what I'm seeing.  Then a third object came into view, then a fourth one, and then a  fifth one.   At this point I was taken back for a minute, because there was no noise of any kind.  The objects moved horizontally without any of them slowing descending as a flare would.  This is when I knew that I was witnessing something that was out of the norm.  All I want to know is what was it.  If any one else has had any similar experiences in Louisiana please make post.
