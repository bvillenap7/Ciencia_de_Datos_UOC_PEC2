Fast moving white light;2009-11-25 21:10:00;Seconds;Fast moving white light Saw a very fast moving bright, white light cross the sky and it was not an airplane.  I am very familiar with seeing many planes take off from various airports around here and it was moving too fast to be one of those.

They were spaced out and in single file line as the approaced, then shortly after flying over the dispersed as the headed in the direcdtion of Hwy 190.  They were really low, lower than you'd see an airplane in the sky, with a bright, distinct orange color that appeared to make a circular glow.  The fligh path was perfectly straight until they spread out, and as they flew over head they made absolutely now sound.  I captured video on my cell phone, but the quality is not that good because my hands were shaking.  It was the most amazing thing i've ever seen.
