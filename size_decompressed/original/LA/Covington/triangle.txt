Slow moving triangular object with bright light and no sound at relatively low altitude spotted at dusk.;2010-02-17 18:30:00;1 minute;Slow moving triangular object with bright light and no sound at relatively low altitude spotted at dusk. Myself, wife and 9 yr old daughter observed strange object in sky while driving home from parents house.  Was dusk and object appeared triangular in shape with bright white light in center.  Smaller flashing lights blue in color were also visible.   Pulled into our driveway and continued to watch.  Seemed to be stationary at first then moved slowly eastward, paused and began tracking west.   No sounds were audible and could see what appeared to be a beam of light projecting out sideways from the object visible as it passed through some cloud cover.  Moments later bright light in center turned off and object continued in westward direction at a higher rate of speed until we lost sight of it.  Was definitely not a helicopter with search light. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS REGARDING FLAWED DATE IN ORIGINAL REPORT)) Yes sir it was last night - very fascinating and my curiosity led me to find your site.  Thanks.

Triangular metallic object with lights seen hovering over subdivision.;2020-08-20 22:00:00;15 seconds;Triangular metallic object with lights seen hovering over subdivision. Sitting on the patio, watching the night sky, a white light appeared over the houses across the street, up about 500 ft.  Looking at the light, my wife and I saw a metallic triangular craft.  The white light, it seemed was at the top of the triangle.  One side had a green light and the other side red, navigation type lights.  It just hovered for about 5 secs then slowly and quietly came towards us for about 5 secs, then over our heads and roof.  I ran to the other side of the house to further see it but it was gone.  This happened over Emerald Forest.;30.5074665865384;-90.1009867788453
