Traveling From Fourchon north on LA1 Bridge.  Bright Silver/Chrome object flying through sky vanishes.;2014-03-02 17:00:00;40-50 seconds;Traveling From Fourchon north on LA1 Bridge.  Bright Silver/Chrome object flying through sky vanishes. On 3-2-14 at approximately 1700 hrs, I was driving from Port Fourchon on the Toll bridge north bound heading up toward Golden Meadow.  About midways between Fourchon and the first intersection on the bridge, a co-worker and I noticed a bright silver object moving through the sky from East to West.  This object seemed to be very high in the sky and was larger than a jet/plane/helicopter but smaller than the space station which I have personally watched pass overhead during the daytime.  It was moving as fast as the space station does across the sky from East to West.   We watched the object for approximately 40 to 50 seconds.  The sky was very clear where the object was.  There were clouds on the horizon, blue skies above those clouds, and a cloud or two directly above us.   While my co-worker and I were watching the object and discussing what it may be, it disappeared.  He and I were both looking directly at the object when this happened.  It just vanished.   To further describe the object, it looked like it was completely covered in chrome.  It was very bright but it was not reflecting the sunlight.  We could see the outline which looked like an elongated oval shape.;29.3808;-90.2682
