We watched from a stop sign in our car as it hovered and had red and white lights at first rotating.   There was no engine we could hear and it was was maybe a hundred feet in the air.  As we watched it began moving in a straight line toward us.   We turned out onto the highway towards town.  It began following us with green and white lights alternating with some blue and red.  It very quickly approached the car as we sped down the highway and kept pace with us much closer to the ground.  It paced us for a while and then quickly shot away from the car at breakneck speed in a near straight light back into the direction we first saw it.
