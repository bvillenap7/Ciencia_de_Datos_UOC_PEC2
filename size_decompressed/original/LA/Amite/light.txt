I am in a rural area that is wooded, but I was standing in less wooded location when a bright light caught my eye.  I turned to see it, and it appeared to pass behind a big pine tree.  I couldn't tell how far away the object was, but it was traveling horizontal to the horizen and low in the sky.  It looked to be about the size of a pea and was round, glowing white-blue, and had a tail.  It made no noise.  It looked like it could be a  big meteorite, but I've never seen a meteorite travel in a straight horizontal line.  After a few seconds, the light disappeared like it had been turned off.;30.7214;-90.4895
