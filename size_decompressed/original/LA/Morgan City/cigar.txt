It was around lunch time with clear skies (no clouds what so ever) & it was Brighter than Anything I've Ever seen in the sky on a clear day!  It must have been far from me because it was small, but the shape & brightness of the color made it hard to miss. It caught my attention as a helicopter was flying low over my house & as I looked up at it I saw the object.  I was facing South looking in the direction of the Gulf of Mexico.  I looked at it for about 3 minutes as it slowly moved East.Â  Then the brightness of it started to dim, almost like it was about to disappear when it turned facing away from me and away from Earth & toward SPACE...  Then it disappeared.;29.7007;-91.2671
