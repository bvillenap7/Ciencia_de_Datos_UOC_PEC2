Orange pulsating streak high up in the North East early morning sky in the area of Morgan City Louisiana;2008-04-25 04:50:00;1Hr 10 minutes;Orange pulsating streak high up in the North East early morning sky in the area of Morgan City Louisiana While traveling east on Hwy 90 in them early morning hours (4:50 AM) of April 25th in the area of Morgan City Louisiana a orange pulsating streak of light in the sky caught my attention. I only noticed it out of the driver’s side window because the pulsating glow caught my attention in the dark night sky. At first I though it was a Radio tower light, but it was too long of a streak of orange in the sky and too high for it to be coming from a tower. It kind of looked like the fiery exhaust from a missile. It was in the North East portion of the sky. I could see some stars behind it, but don’t know what constellation was in view at that time of the morning. I estimate the orange streak was about 6” in length (using my thumb and forefinger at arms length) about 55 degrees above the horizon. It was a steady orange glow that kind of pulsated. It kind of looked like it had a head. I pulled over on the side of the highway to observe it twice on my way to New Orleans and tried to video it with a cheap video camea I carry with me. The video did not come out. It was still visible in the pre-dawn sky when I got to Avondale Louisiana and was almost directly over head at that time. I was not able to continue observing it due to heavy traffic a little after 6 AM. It kind of reminded me of a comet with a tail, but I never heard anything in the news about one or anything else.;29.7007;-91.2671
