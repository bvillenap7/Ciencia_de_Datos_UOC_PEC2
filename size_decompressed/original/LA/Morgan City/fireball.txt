Orange object in sky over Patterson or Morgan City area;2010-10-26 18:30:00;2 min;Orange object in sky over Patterson or Morgan City area Saw a orange streak falling through the sky.  At first, I thought it was a meteor, plane crash, or even missile attack, but whenever it stopped it’s fall and turned horizontal, we took notice and recorded a video of the orange looking object.  It went horizontal for a short time and looked to have even stopped.  After that, the width got smaller like it was going away, before that the width was the same from the decent vertically and then horizontally.  I don’t believe in aliens, so I’d like to know if anyone else has seen the same thing and can explain the object.;29.7007;-91.2671
