A cigar-shaped craft w/ a highly reflective surface heading south then southeast.;2016-06-11 19:08:00;2 minutes;A cigar-shaped craft w/ a highly reflective surface heading south then southeast. A single cigar shaped object traveling due south it seemed to have a highly reflective surface appearing to reflect the setting sun.   Suddenly the craft was no longer reflecting the setting sun, and was hard to follow against the sky, but I was able to follow it bc me and my witness never took our eyes off of it.   At that point it began to gain altitude and accelerated and rapidly disappeared heading in a south easterly direction.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
