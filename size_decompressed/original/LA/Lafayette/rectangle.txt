I saw a rectangular shoe-box shape unidentified stationary object.  It was the same exact color of the blue sky, making it almost invisible to the naked eye. I was watching jets flying very far away with my binoculars and I saw something I was not meant to see. The sky was crystal clear, very blue, no high altitude clouds, perfect visibility. While following a jet far away, I saw this rectangular shoe-box shape object come into view as I was moving the binoculars. I watched it for a few minutes in total amazement. What is unusual is it was completely motionless, and it was camouflaged the exact shade of color as the blue sky. I was about to yell at my neighbor to come look, but when I looked thru my binoculars again I could no longer see it. It vanished very quickly. I tried for several minutes to find it, but could not. It seemed very far away, which means it must have been pretty large. I looked at it without the binoculars and all I could see was a tiny blue dot. I wish I would have had a telescope with a camera on it to take its picture. What is my opinion? I believe it has an electrochromatic polymer surface to camouflage it the same color as its background. I believe it is a creation of the military-industrial complex, (and it could be foreign-made, as in Russia.) As for the ability of this non-aerodynamic craft to hover motionless, and then fly away at high speed, I suspect scalar wave technology is in effect.
