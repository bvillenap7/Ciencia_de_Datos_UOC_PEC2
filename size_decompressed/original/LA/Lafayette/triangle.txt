A huge orange triangle heads toward Earth!;2002-08-30 17:00:00;around 10 minutes;A huge orange triangle heads toward Earth! I was about 9 (Im now 12) and I had just come home from school when my mom noticed all the cars pulling over. We asked some people outside their car why everyone was doing this. He pointed to the sky. A orange triangular craft with a circle in the middle of it was hovering in the sky. It was way too high for anyone to make out what it was but we could tell it was huge. It stayed in the same spot for about 15 minutes (since we got there) and it slowly turned into just the round circle in the middle. No one could believe it. The orange triangular craft formed into a circle right in front of our eyes! It starting coming closer to Earth. Still high in the sky but closer. It started moving in circular patterns in the sky. Heading even closer. Then it instantly went back up and vanished.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194

Fire-orange glowing craft moved forward quickly, stopped, hovered, changed directions quickly, stopped, then disappeared into thin air.;2013-09-28 21:40:00;2 minutes;Fire-orange glowing craft moved forward quickly, stopped, hovered, changed directions quickly, stopped, then disappeared into thin air. Bright orange glowing craft. Flew quickly into view in straight line and stopped, moved to the left a bit and then to the right. It was during this time I was able to observe that object appeared to have 2, maybe 3, glowing orange circles situated close together on one object. Object then moved quickly to the left what seemed to me to be about one hundred feet, but was most likely in actuality much farther, then just disappeared. My first thought when I saw it was what the hell is that?  For the duration of my observation I was in awe. I have never observed an aircraft to move in that fashion, and most definitely have not seen any fire-orange craft ever in the sky above. It was a most exciting, yet terrifying, experience. I was almost frightened, and am having difficulty describing exactly what it was I saw. I am in the city in a subdivision, so the background was just the night sky with a few trees along the street. I was just going to get the gr! oceries out of my vehicle. I was a bit frightened because of the way the object moved, and then remained stationary for a bit, it almost seemed as though it might be scanning the area below. Although it was not close enough to be a threat, by all measures approximately three times as far up as an airplane would pass over my residence, it had an ominous feel to it. Because of the unusual nature of the object, naturally I wanted to hide, but was mesmerized and instead followed the path of the object until it simply disappeared into thin air directly above me.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
