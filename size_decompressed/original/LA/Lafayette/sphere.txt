They were a fire-like orange color and appeared to flicker like flames. They came from the horizon North-Northeast and grew increasingly brighter until they reached a bright flicker, and continued to travel in a straight line until they faded dark as they approached the horizon Southeast. The objects appeared to be flying at a high altitude. They were flying above the community of River Ranch.  We saw them when we were in a parking lot of the River Ranch area.  The objects moved across the sky at a steady pace and was visible for about a minute.  The objects came into sight randomly between 21:10 and 21:19.  There was one earlier sighting of which I did not note the time, but I estimate to be 21:00. I heard what I believe to be a low hum coming from the objects.  My close friend and elder brother were with me. I witnessed the first one alone.  They didn't believe me and thought them to be drones.  After they witnessed the other three together with me, they also could not explain what they saw. One witness is a programmer, the other an editor, and I am a student, musician and writer.  The fourth witness was a cleaning lady who was passing by, and said that she had never seen anything like it and believed it to be alien crafts.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
