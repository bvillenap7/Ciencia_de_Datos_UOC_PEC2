I saw a triangle  formation in the sky of eight  bright red lights.;2009-01-23 08:55:00;10 minutes;I saw a triangle  formation in the sky of eight  bright red lights. I was walking down the street to bring something to my brother down the street when I noticed a triangle formation of eight bright red lights. They were low enough that if they were planes there would have been a sound. There was no sound from these lights. When I got to the neighbor's house, we watched them. One blinked out before I got to the neighbors,leaving seven bright red lights in a triangle formation. Then suddenly five disappeared,two bright red lights. I have star gazed and studied astronomy for years and have never come across this in my life. there are 11 other witnesses other than myself.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
Red lights over Lafayette, Louisiana.;2011-07-15 21:20:00;5 to 7 minutes;Red lights over Lafayette, Louisiana. I am one that can usually find an explanation for just about anything, but last night July 15, 2011 at approximately 9:20 p.m., I went into the backyard of my Lafayette, Louisiana home and looked up in the sky facing North West, immediately I saw seven bright red/orange round objects/lights in a slightly staggered formation.  I was stunned at what I was seeing and I started yelling for my boyfriend to “get out here”.  Once he stepped outside he saw exactly what I was seeing. As we watched, I would say it all took place over maybe a 5 to7 minute period.  They moved horizontally towards the North while appearing to gain altitude and one by one they would disappear.  Then, we noticed another one approaching from the West beginning at the horizon, just above a distant tree line, moving in the same direction as all the others.  Then there were more coming from the same direction totaling 12 to 13 and they faded away one by one in roughly the same location in the North.  During the entire occurrence there was no sound. We tried to take pictures and video, but nothing was clear.  We live on the outer edge of the city, so the sky is not affected by the city lights.  There are only a few street lights in the subdivision.  Also, I am very familiar with planes, stars and even shooting stars out here and these objects we saw were none of these. Once everything was over, we were both in shock.  I called one of the local news stations to find out if there were any reports and I was told none were called in.  I then called the airport (knowing these were not planes) and asked if they had any planes taking off or landing at that time.  As I was speaking with a gentleman at the airport, he told me they had one that was supposed to land at 9:30 p.m., but was running late and at that point I saw it flying across the sky and it looked nothing like what we had seen previously.  It was moving across the sky at a much more rapid pace.  I searched the internet for any other reports last night and this morning, but I found nothing.  Then, I found this site and called the number given and now I am posting this detailed report of the occurrence. Is there any other explanation for what we saw? ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally objective and eloquent in her description of her sighting.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.  PD));30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
I am looking for an explanation to why would something so big not built by human intelligence visit...me.;2012-10-21 03:33:00;5-7 minutes;I am looking for an explanation to why would something so big not built by human intelligence visit...me. It was around 3:33a.m. in the morning after falling to sleep watching television.  Ancient Aliens on the History Channel was the last show of this sort of interest that I remember watching around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. that night. I get exited about ufos and once it's is on the air of television I can't put my fork down. lol   I woke up out of a dream (can't really remember exactly what it pertained to but, I, at the time was really back infatuated with the paranormal events that were occuring accross America. I got off of my sofa and kept thinking about what it would be like walking on a battlefield where the U.S. would be in a sort of intense battle with E.T.s in spaceships you would see maybe in a dream or vision. I walked to the spacious ground area which was about 1 acre or so in length and 3/4 of a football field wide. My imagination is vivid and wide most of the time so I felt ok to see landed spaceships and pretend thing were flying in the night sky.  Don't know for sure if I really saw something around there but it definitly was capturing and frightening. I got a little too scared so I said I'm going back inside. Didn't look back at all into the sky until I got up the stairs by my apartment and felt something in my atmosphere. [Thank God I just got an extension on this computer] I sort of felt curious so I.....started using suggestions...to see if I could get whatever I was sensing to reveal itself to me. I knew it wasn't a spirit so I'm not sitting up in my little leaky, dark, and lonely apartment by myself without being sure I would be at least absolutely safe.   Well, the moment got intense and once again that definite....feeling of unsurety hit me. Harder than my first encounter. I looked at the dish network sattelite, looked behind it into the sky, something told me to turn my entire body to the right and look up above the apt. building accross from me and quietly w/ a syncronized....effort we connected with one another. 3 ! immensely, sleek, yet most emormous...floating like...with no ! gravitat ional pull and it took so long to disappear I took a comfortable position of facing it just to see what it was doing or going to do. It was in a formation of three two side by side in the front of the formation and in the middle between the front two yet behind. In formation like a Navy division in ranks marching.  The formation came up to a huge cloud big enough to cover all three objects. The front of the formation vanished behind the clouds like expected because I don't think ufos or extraterrestials want to...really be seen but expecting the unexpected the last one....IT NEVER DISAPPEARED. It's intense,.....BLINDING light shined through this dark gray early a.m. cloud like it never traveled behind anything and stayed there.  I was soooo scared to where I was gonna go inside at this point in time in fear of some sort of (God forgive me for saying) possible undetectable attack.  Still I waited. It sat behind the gray cloudfor about 30 seconds. And then it disappeared.  Like i! t was never there and all I could do is stand there in awe and fright. I got this ufo website out of Dr. Lynne D. Kitei's book The Phoenix Lights and used it in hopes of getting in contact with her or someone who is employed with connection to this website who is experienced with people have post effects from close encounters on any kind. Because these sightings have effectson my still. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
Single file bright lights  appear then disappear.;2013-11-28 19:30:00;7 minutes;Single file bright lights  appear then disappear 12 to sixteen bright lights traveling in a single file line.  They would appear in the north at around 30 degrees up in the sky from eye level, then move to a point to the northwest about forty five degrees up in the sky from eye level, then they would fade until they all disappeared in the same location.  It was very clear and stars were visible all around the locations of the lights.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
