Half V-formation lights with plan not far behind.;2016-01-12 22:30:00;~1 minute;Half V formation lights with plan not far behind. I saw at least 12 lights in the shspe of a half triangle.  It was moving from west to east pretty quickly.  I kept adjusting my eyes because it looked like birds in the V formation, except the right side was shorter on lights.  I am still trying to understand ehat it was.   As it faded in the distance a plane was following it.  The plane had a flashing light so I knew what it was.  I ran back to my truck and jumped on google and twitter using key words hoping someone in the area saw the dame thing. It was also very silent.  If I had not looked up while walking my dogs I would have never known.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
