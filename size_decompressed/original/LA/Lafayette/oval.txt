Falling red ufo over Lafayette, Louisiana.;2014-06-13 15:00:00;7 seconds;Falling red ufo over Lafayette,Louisiana Me and my son saw a falling object from about an eight of a mile away going down behind some trees.  It was a clear and sunny day.   It was deep red like the color and translucence of a vehicles brake light.  It fell slowly.   Slower than a normal object would fall.   It was about the size of a dime at our distance.   The time is an approximation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

As stated above.  No movement just all that I saw. Perhaps someone else saw this.;2016-03-19 21:00:00;1 hour;As stated above. No movement just all that I saw. Perhaps someone else saw this. While looking through my 11 inch SCT Telescope, I saw a black object on the moon's north east quadrant.   Based on the size of the Moon's straight wall, I would estimate the size to be 3 miles long.  It looked like a small wooden splinter you would get when loading lumber. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
