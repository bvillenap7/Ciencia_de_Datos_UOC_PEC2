A sighting of four bright objects seen performing unusual maneuvers with no apparent change in speed.;1986-04-15 21:50:00;1 minute;A sighting of four bright objects seen performing unusual maneuvers with no apparent change in speed. The four objects of medium luminosity were observed travelling at an undetermined height - but definitely greater than 10,000 feet in line abreast formation with uniform spacing between the objects.  It is impossible to determine their speed other than that they appeared to be travelling more quickly than a commercial airliner, but their speed was constant.  After traveling roughly 1/2 of the way across the visible sky, the formation instanteously changed to a diamond formation with no apparent change in the speed of any of the objects.  It was almost magical, in that it changed literally in the blink of an eye.  After travelling approximately 2/3 of the way across the visible sky the formation again instantaeously changed, this time into a line with the space between the objects considerably diminished.  As soon as this line was formed, in order each of the objects described a semicircular path with the first going right, the second left, third right, and fourth left. With the completion of the maneuver, the objects ended up in a line identical to the one observed just before the maneuver began.  As soon as the line formed, the objects again instantaneously shifted to a line abreast formation, and contined until I could no longer observe the objects.  Thoughout the entire process, with the exception of the semicircular maneuver (at which they appeared to move more rapidly) was there any change in the apparent speed of the objects.  As an enthusiast of military and sporting aviation, I can categorically state that no military or commercial aircraft that I am aware of can make the types of manuevers made by these objects.  During the entire event there was no sound associated with the passage of these objects.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
2 very bright balls of light dancing. The brightest light I have ever seen.;2003-10-04 16:30:00;15 min;2 very bright balls of light dancing. The brightest light I have ever seen. At approxiamatley 4:30pm on Oct. 4, 2003 while driving West on I-10 about 25 miles before Lafayette, La.. My roomate and I noticed a beam of light coming from the sky which was unusal because there were few clouds in the sky and it was very clear, good weather. This beam of light was a white color and was very distintive like and upside down V. This beam would sort of fade in and out, we watched the beam for about 5 min or so. Just amazed how it would fade in and out . And of course we joked about it being a UFO. Within in another min. or so a very bright ball of light appeared and it just appeared from nothing. It moved left to right, up and down, it moved pretty rapidly but it would just go a short distance. It was sort of like dancing. I know that sounds crazy. At this pint, we knew that it was not a plane, helicopter, weather ballon, or any of the other 100 or so things we tried to make it to be. It was beautiful. And then it just disappeared behind a small cloud. Now I was jumping up and down in the seat telling my friend i needed my camera. Got the camera and waited. Another few minutes passed and we kept and eye onthe cloud we last saw it and sure enough it reappeared and there were 2 of the balls of light. Same size and shape. I can't tell you how big they were. But to me and my friend they looked like the same. Very bright white balls of light. These 2 did exactly what the first did. Moving left to right, up down, and bouncing, dancing, like i said it was strange. I'm 35 years old and have always been a believer in UFO's i've just never actually  seen one until now. If any one has seen what i'm describing I know how you feel. I am a courier driver i live in the Chattanooga area I drive from 1:00am to 8:00am M-F. I have 2 years of college in the study of Criminal Justice. My roomate is 36 and is a dispatcher for a local trucking company and has been a Over the road truck driver for 5 years in the past. The whole experience lasted aprox. 15-20 min. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed to us to be quite credible.  PD));30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
Bright colors, changed speeds of colors changing.;2011-06-23 01:00:00;Approx. 3-4 minutes;Bright colors, changed speeds of colors changing. I woke up around 1:00 am, to extremely bright changing colors (blue, green, orange) lights shining through my bedroom window (a second floor apartment).  They were rotating at a slow speed at first, I got up from my bed and was startled by the lights speed up and disappear.  I was curious but didn't have the guts to look through my window.

Brightest fastest thing I have ever seen in the sky, around Lafayette, LA, area.;2014-07-12 20:20:00;3 seconds;brightest fastest thing i have ever seen in the sky, around lafayette, la area. the sky was grey just after sunset. was heading back to Lake Charles from baton rouge after taking a state test. was on the phone with a friend and I saw it.  It was so bright and so fast it was unreal.   There was a thin cloud horizontally it was maybe 6 thick in my view but probably quite large in reality.  I saw it for about one second going so fast into the cloud and a split second later was on the other side of the cloud and within 2 to 3 seconds later it was out of the atmosphere.  I could tell that it wasnt following the curvature of the earth.  Instead, it faded into the atmosphere.   I really cannot stress how fast and how bright this thing was.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
Two pale red lights one sitting right next to the other, appeared, hovered and moved across the sky.;2014-09-23 23:30:00;30-40 seconds;Two pale red lights one sitting right next to the other, appeared, hovered and moved across the sky. As a pilot, I can assure you that what my friend and I saw was no airplane. I was with my friend star gazing, looking up at the sky while lying on a blanket, what happened next occurred at ~23:30 on 9/23/14.  Two pale red lights one sitting right next to the other, appeared out of nowhere, about 3° separated from each other.   They appeared almost directly above us in the sky and hovered there for roughly 10 seconds, they were 90° perpendicular to the ground, dead center in the top of the sky from my perspective, from that point they moved across the sky in an extremely fast fashion at an approximate heading of 180°.   They continued to move across the sky until they disappeared into the atmospheric haze at roughly 10-15° elevation.  During this time it was completely silent, no sounds of motors and/or jets, no flashing beacon/anti-collision lights from aircraft wings or empennages, just two solid red lights.  Based on pure speculation the lights appeared to be roughly 20,000 feet in the air and for them to be moving across the sky in excess of 15-20 degrees second that would have to mean they were moving extremely fast  Far faster than any aircraft that I know of.  I take a special pride in my ability to recognize planes at night and this is nothing like anything I have ever seen in my life.. It should also be noted that there were an abundance of shooting stars this night. This sighting occurred at 30°12'13.51N, 92° 2'28.84W ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and eloquent.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
First the space station, then another distinct light crossed it, hesitated and zigzagged opposite it until disappearing.;2018-06-08 22:12:00;20 seconds;First the space station, then another distinct light crossed it, hesitated and zigzagged opposite it until disappearing. We were watching the International Space Station cross the sky on its designated trajectory at the time reported by our local TV station weatherman.  As it disappeared into the NE sky, another smaller lighted object appearing to be higher and farther up from the station, intersected the path, coming from the SE, hesitated, then zigzagged at irregular speed then suddenly sped up and disappeared upwards and towards the NW.   The object was too distant and not as bright as the space station, but we definitely saw it as we stood looking upward.  We routinely watch for the station to pass over when the night is clear and the weatherman announces to look for it.  It was too far to make out any shape.  No photos, no video, it happened so fast we were shocked, in disbelief, and because it was so far away,  I don't think getting an image w/ our phones would have been possible.   Just wondering if anyone else saw it. Looked like a distant shooting star but it was weaving back an forth on purpose, traveling opposite the normal orbit of the space station.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
