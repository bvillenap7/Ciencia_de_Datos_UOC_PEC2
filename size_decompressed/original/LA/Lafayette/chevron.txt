Large grey, chevron-like, rows of lights underneath.  Jan. 29, 2016, Lafayette, LA;2016-01-29 23:00:00;1 minute;Large grey, chevron-like, rows of lights underneath.  Jan. 29, 2016, Lafayette, LA While visiting a friend in Louisiana.  The shape is hard to describe.  Chevron is the closest.  While entering the back door from backyard, about 10:45 PM, I heard a flock of geese honking and flying overhead, so my attention was drawn to the sky.  Above the geese, far up in the night's sky, I could see a strange aircraft moving slowly West in the opposite direction of the geese.  At first I thought of a stealth bomber, but it was too big.  Kind of chevron like, three rows of lights.  Large. Medium grey against a dark sky.  Almost same color as sky but you could see the shape and lights.  Just North of Orion's Belt from my view, heading slowly west.   The house roof hid it for a moment so I went to the north side of the house and it appeared to have changed course towards the right, traveling slowly, going farther North.  I could see more details under the craft, still saw the rows of lights (not blinking), flying lower than I'd expect to see an airplane.  It flew behind the tall oak trees, so I could no longer see it.   I am a 64 year old, retired school teacher, and had not been under any drug or alcohol influences.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
