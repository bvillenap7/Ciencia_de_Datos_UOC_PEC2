fireball seen in morning then bright light seen in same area later in the day.;2005-12-23 06:45:00;2 sec;fireball seen in morning then bright light seen in same area later in the day. On Friday morning at 06:45 I was out side smoking under my garage and something lit up the sky very bright that caught my attention.  I looked up to the sky in the SW direction and saw what appeared to be a extremely bright giant (white) fireball decending at a rapid rate of speed towards earth.  If i had to guess I looked like it crashed no more than 5 to 10 miles away. There are trees and houses obstucting view so I couldnt see an impact but im sure it came down. Ive seen meteors that burn up in the atmosphere but this thing came strait down and I did not witness it burn out. There was no sound of crash either. Then later that same day at about 18:30 I was in the same spot and noticed an extremely bright light lingering over that same area. I figured it to be a plane on final appraoch as we have an airport to the east of us. I watched it hover go up,down, and sideways till finally It decended below the tree line. I have had other encounters with such lights and this looked very familiar.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
Twelve orange/red orbs glided across the sky of Lafayette, LA on Christmas Eve;2014-12-24 20:17:00;2 minutes;Twelve orange/red orbs glided across the sky of Lafayette, LA on Christmas Eve Tonight, on Christmas Eve, my sister, my mother, my mothers boyfriend, and I all witnessed the same UFO sighting.  My sister and I are university students, my mom is a executive assistant at a helicopter company, and my mothers boyfriend is a lawyer.   My mother and her boyfriend went outside to put a new registration sticker on my license plate and my mom immediately starting shouting for us to come outside and look at something.   My sister and I ran outside and my mom pointed up at the sky excitedly.  We looked up and saw these orange/red orb looking objects in the sky.  There were about twelve of them and they were gliding across the sky. It was completely silent and they looked as if they were pulsating they would get brighter and dimmer.   They followed one another across the sky in a sort of line, but not a straight one.  Some were closer to one another than others and a couple of them were in a triangle-like formation.  The whole event lasted about two minutes and when they got about halfway across the sky, one by one they faded and disappeared.   I've always believed in UFOs but seeing one in person made my jaw drop. I sat outside for thirty minutes after with the hopes of seeing it again, but they never reappeared.;30.1971235023041;-92.0358096774194
