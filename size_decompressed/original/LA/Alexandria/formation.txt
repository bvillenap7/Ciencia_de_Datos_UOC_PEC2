Row of lights over city;2002-01-14 19:15:00;>1 min.;Row of lights over city No actual shape identified but a succession of 4 white lights blinking on, starting from the left going to the right, then blinking off from the right to the left, all at a 45 degree angle upward.   They were lined up in this angle after they were all lit.  This was done 3 times.   SW direction over the city, approx. 45 degrees above the city.   These lights were very bright and when one would light up the others followed in succession and went out in succession.   Could not detect any shape of craft.;31.301005;-92.46729875

My friend Stuart and I were on our way to Books A Million to pick up my wife from work who would be geeting off at 8:00pm.  It was probably 5 minutes before 8 when it happened. As i was turning in to the parking lot I saw a group of what looked light glowing balls of light come out of knowhere, they didn't seem to be in any formation at the time and I was like stuart Do You See That and he was like yeah and then these glowing balls formed into a  line that  sort of looked like the were turning either towards us or away and as they turned we could see that the turned into like a streamline of light and then they just Dissappeared just like that.  So it was like, no formation of glowing balls, formation and moving in the same direction and then to a perfect line then dissapeared.  We were shocked!  It was amazing! And later we both discussed the fact that the lights looked sort of like the yellow caution lights you see on roads, but from a distance. Also if that was some sort of military aircraft turning in flight then it was a HUGE one maybe the size of a b-52.  But, the fact that it went from no frormation to formation boggled our minds.  I'm happy that there was a sight to post this on, it makes me feel a little better about the wholesituation. Thanks!!  Robert Randow;31.301005;-92.46729875
