Recurrent orange and white lights over Alexandria, LA;2009-06-11 21:30:00;52 mins;Recurrent orange and white lights over Alexandria, LA We saw similar events on Monday and last night. The approximate time is between 8:30pm and 10:22pm. and occurs in teh southwestern sky. I used my binoculars this time. The lights were paired and were three in number. With the naked eye, they appeared to be single lights. Each night, they were accompanied by orange lights which lasted about 10secs. Tonight, I timed the light, (just over the distant horizon), at 82 seconds. The orange light did not move and appeared to hover in one spot. I was on the phone with my sister when the orange light appeared and stayed. She said the phone was breaking up on her end. It stopped when the orange light disappeared.
