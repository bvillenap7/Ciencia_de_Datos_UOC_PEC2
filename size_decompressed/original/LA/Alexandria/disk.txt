Covered Disk shaped Object on Flatbed with US Army Soldiers Following Closely ((NUFORC Note:  Military craft??  PD));2020-02-13 14:00:00;10 seconds;Covered Disk shaped Object on Flatbed with US Army Soldiers Following Closely As sent by Text to Me this evening (February 14, 2020) by a Very Reliable Source:  On Thursday February 13, 2020, while returning back to Baton Rouge from Dallas, Texas, I was traveling Southbound on Interstate I-49. I saw on the North bound side of I-49 a Convoy featuring two Pickup Trucks traveling side by side.  One of which had a tall pole which I presumed being used for checking Overpass Clearances.  Following the Pick-up trucks, there were Two Louisiana State Police Cruisers.  Following the State Police Cruisers was an 18 wheeler carrying a “Covered” DISK Shaped Object which spanned both Lanes.  Behind the 18 wheeler there were three Army Trucks carrying soldiers.  Traffic behind the Convoy, must have been backed up for two miles.  By the time I thought about it and grabbed my Cell Phone, it was too late to get a picture.  My Comments: If the Army was taking the lead on this “Project”, the convoy may have been traveling to the Fort Polk Army Base. England Air Force Base would be my next guess. However, it may have been built by Boudreaux and Thibodaux for running Crawfish Traps on one of the Military Bases. The General Might Be a Cajun!
