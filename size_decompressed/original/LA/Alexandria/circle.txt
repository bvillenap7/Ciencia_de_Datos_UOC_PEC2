I was driving south highway on 71 towards Louisiana State University at Alexandria in Alexandria Louisiana.  It was a Thursday night.   I saw bright golden lights traveling behind each other in close succession in a straight diagnal line.  At first they looked like fireworks due to the amount of them, but I quickly realized fireworks do not travel in a straight line.  There were about seven to nine of them.  They appeared then disappeared twice, at which point two small stars a good distance apart blinked rapidly across the sky, as if in communication with each other.  They were a little more apart than the length of my hand. I was looking towards the east over the tree tops.  This all took place in the time span of about 3-4 minutes, I pulled over to the side of the road to watch. This is the 2nd time in a month I have seen the exact same lights, only the first time they were bigger, closer it seemed.  The pattern was the same, same color, same movement.  I was facing south.  The time was about 640 pm. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates three times for the sighting.  We are confused.  PD));31.301005;-92.46729875
