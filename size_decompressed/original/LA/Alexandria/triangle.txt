Five white  lights in V-shaped pattern seen along Interstate 49 just south of Alexandria;1998-03-25 23:30:00;2 minutes;Five white  lights in V-shaped pattern seen along Interstate 49 just south of Alexandria My family and I were traveling southbound on Interstate 49 one evening we had just left the city limits. Just outside of the city, there is an Alexandria water tower along the western side of the Interstate. We've made this commute south to Forest Hill hundreds of times but tonight was different. Approximately 100 feet south of the water tower, there were five white lights in a roughly triangular shape. The lights were hovering roughly 75-150 feet in the air, above the tree line.  The sight of these lights disturbed my family, causing my mother (who was driving) to panic.  I rolled down the window to determine whether or not there was any sound associated with the lights there was no sound. Since we were traveling on an interstate highway, we never stopped moving.  However, there was other vehicular traffic that witnessed this event. In fact, other southbound vehicles were driving slowly to witness the event, as well (you could see many vehicles' brake lights being applied). My brother suggested that it was helicopters or flares but I quickly dismissed those suggestions: the lights were each roughly 10-15 feet in diameter, and no smoke or vapor was being emitted that I could discern.  I could not determine whether or not the lights belonged to an aircraft because the lights were very bright, which dazzled my eyes. The lights remained stationary until our traveling brought our vehicle out of view of the lights.  It was an eerie experience that I have never forgotten and only now do I report it since recently discovering the NUFORC site.;31.301005;-92.46729875
