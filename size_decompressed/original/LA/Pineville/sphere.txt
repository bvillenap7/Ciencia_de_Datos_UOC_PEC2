Sun light relecting off a metallic type surface.;2003-01-17 17:30:00;5-10 minutes;Sun light relecting off a metallic type surface. Myself, my wife and daughter were traveling Westbound on Hwy 28East in Pineville to go the pharmacy. The sun was setting and the sky was bright and clear with very few clouds if any. As we approached the top of a hill i saw off to the west a bright object in the sky,it seemed to be almost metallic. It reminded me of the light reflecting off an aircraft as it turns, the object did not appear to be moving . My wife and daughter asked what it could be,at first i thought it was an airliner, but when it didnt move i began to wonder. We were traveling in that direction, at times it seemed to disappear but would return to the same spot.As we waited to turn into the parking lot i noticed a second object that appeared to make a turn toward the 1st but i was unable to see what it did after as i had to turn.After we pulled into the pharmacy parking lot i backed up into a spot so i could watch the object further, but after parking it was no longer visiable. It could have been 2 airliners or even a weather ballon but i really don't know, i do know it was metallic in look with the sun reflecting off it.;31.2248796610169;-92.3222016949153
Silver sphere shimmers into focus for about five seconds before disappearing.;2015-06-01 18:00:00;5 seconds;Silver sphere shimmers into focus for about five seconds before disappearing. My husband and I were outside preparing to grill steaks.  A couple of ultralight planes fly over fairly regularly and were making their trip North that afternoon.  As we watched them fly over, a silver sphere shimmered into focus about 20 feet above the ground near the corner of our porch.  My husband spoke at the same time I did.  I said, Holy crap! He said, did you see that?!?   Had he not seen it and spoken also, I probably would've just attributed it to some crazy anomaly that I was seeing because of the angle I was looking.  From my vantage point, it seemed to shimmer back out but he said it shot to the East from his viewpoint. (We were facing in such a way that our lines of sight were perpendicular). I had never seen anything like that before.  It kind of reminded me of a giant bubble with the iridescent shimmer just before it became a solid silver.  Then, again, as it disappeared, it became iridescent before it completely disappeared.!  We live on a military facility but didn't say anything for fear of sounding a little crazy...or of inciting panic.  It hasn't been back but we always watch for it when we're outside.;31.2248796610169;-92.3222016949153
