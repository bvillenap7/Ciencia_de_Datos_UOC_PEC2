I was driving. We were almost back to our dorm and was stopped at a stop sign. There wasn't hardly any traffic.  My friend and I was amazed. It was huge! Black metallic rectangular shaped. It was close, hovered, and soundless.  We were speechless.  In addition, my car actually died and did not start until the craft was out of site.  When it moved, it rotated.  I was thankful my friend saw it with me or else I would have questioned my sanity.  Before I saw it, I did not believe in the possibility and was strongly against the existance of such things. However, ever since, I am very interested in the possibility of UFOs and possibility of other intelligent life forms.   I am glad that I saw this.  Even though many didn't believe us, we KNOW what we saw and experienced. I will never forget and could draw a picture of it even now...almost 30 years later.;31.2248796610169;-92.3222016949153
