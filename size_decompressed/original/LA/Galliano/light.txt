These lights passed below the cloud deck at about the same speed or maybe a little slower then when I watch the ISS pass.  There was NO flashing lights like a plane would have and there was no sound.  Each light was seen for approximately 2 minutes then disappeared suddenly.   Does anyone have an explanation?;29.4313;-90.2962
