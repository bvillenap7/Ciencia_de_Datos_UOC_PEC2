Object seen where nothing should have been at all.;2003-08-01 01:00:00;30 minutes;Object seen where nothing should have been at all. At around 1:00 am, my friend and I were returning from a long week of fishing out in the Gulf of Mexico, when, in the pitch-blackness of the swamp, we noticed a circular glowing object in our path through the swamp. We stopped our boat's engine, and observed the object for about 30 minutes, doing what seemed to us to be surveying the area. We both contemplated what we should do, and decided to move ahead to our destination. As soon as we moved towards the object, it's glow intensified, and it began to ascend into the sky very slowly, as if to let us pass. We got within 200 feet of it, and it vanished, no sound, nothing.  My friend and I do not drink alcohol, do not use drugs, and have gown up in the swamps of Louisiana, never having witnessed anything like that before. I travel by plane all over the USA, and I am quite familiar with many different types of aircraft. I am very critical, I don't believe in beings from other worlds, bigfoot, or ghosts. But I am left baffled at what we saw, and I would like to have an answer to what we may have encountered. My friend is terrified to say anything at all about our experience.;29.4313;-90.2962
