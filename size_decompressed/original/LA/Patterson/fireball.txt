Fireball seen flying towards earth.;2014-08-12 23:00:00;5 seconds;fireball seen flying towards earth Me and 2 of my friends were sitting outside and my friend said look.  We all looked up to see a what I can only describe as a fireball flying through the sky.   I got a good look at it but by the time I thought to film it it disappeared behind the tree line and looked as though it was heading to earth.  I almost wanted to get in my truck and go towards it.;29.7005;-91.2803
