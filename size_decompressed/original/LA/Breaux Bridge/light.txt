Two red and white blinking lights that stayed still in the night sky.;2014-08-09 02:00:00;~3 hours;Two red and white blinking lights that stayed still in the night sky. I was on my way home from a friend's house at two in the morning and about halfway home, I saw a light shoot down from the sky all the way behind the tree-line.  I assumed it was a shooting star so I made a wish. I eventually made it to my house and as I'm driving down my driveway, I notice a strange blinking light of all different colors.  It looked like it was fidgeting like an insect would.  I stared at it for a while looking for any hints as to find out what it was, but it never moved so it couldn't have been an airplane.  I called both of my parents outside and they saw it too.  It was hard to see it because of the distance but you could tell the colors definitely included red, white, and a blueish green.   I called my friends from a city away and they saw the same thing. We also noticed that there was another one not too far to the right.  They both looked exactly the same.  We stayed out there for about an hour and noticed that very slowly they were traveling upward.;30.2948;-91.8296
