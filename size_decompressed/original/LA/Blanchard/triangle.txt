Three lights in a triangular formation;2009-06-30 03:00:00;5 minutes;A friend of mine and I were outside late at night around 3 AM, just hanging out and talking on his porch.  All of a sudden, we saw three lights in a triangular formation in the sky.  My father is military, and has showed me what different airplanes look like at night, so of course I tried to match these lights up to the lights of common airplanes.  Blanchard, Louisiana, is in the middle of nowhere in Northwestern Louisiana.  Just as I was trying to figure it out, the lights all moved at once to the right in the sky at an outrageous speed.  They zipped to the left and diagonally to the right again, all the while keeping in a triangular formation.  The lights were white and very bright their light drowned out the light of the stars.  They were moving so fast it was hard to keep up with them.  No sound came from the lights at all. It was very quiet. 	My friend and I watched in amazement and a little bit of terror as well.  It was so strange we both had never seen anything like it in our lives.  The lights decided to zoom towards us they seemed so close that I thought if I reached out I could touch them.  But before I could do that, the lights sped off into the distance and disappeared.  It was a truly amazing experience.
