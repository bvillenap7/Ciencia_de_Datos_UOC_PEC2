Laying in bed, my large window faces the back yard, a cylindrical blue light appears, maybe 12 inches high, is on for about 10 seconds and then fades out.  I have discounted any cars going by, it was just really strange.  Now, I also saw two blues lights about 4 months ago as I was standing in my driveway saying goodnight to my daughter in law and her kids.  These two lights moved in tandem about 50 yards away and about as high as the tree line down the street, then moved to us and past us right above the roofline of our house and then disappeared.  No noise either.  Very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));30.4831;-90.0013
