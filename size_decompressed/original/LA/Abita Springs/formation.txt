Distant objects in formation visible in sunset photos;2004-07-10 20:14:00;Seconds;Distant objects in formation visible in sunset photos Taking photos of a beautiful sunset from my lawn and facing south, nothing unusual was seen through the camera lens. After downloading from camera to computer, photo number 2 out of 3 showed three round objects. There is a possible 4th object at the tree line on the right side at the very tip of a pointed treetop branch. Zooming in on that area it can be seen and appears much like the 3rd (smallest)object in the formation. Picture number 1 was taken at 8.13.52 pm CST. No objects in that photo. Picture number 2 was taken at 8.13.55 pm CST. This is where the objects appeared in the photo. Picture number 3 was taken (same view) at 8.14.16 pm CST. No objects noted.;30.4831;-90.0013
