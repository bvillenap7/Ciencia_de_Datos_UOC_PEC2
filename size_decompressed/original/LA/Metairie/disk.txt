White luminous oblong disk speeding across Old Metairie, LA, sky from West to East, midway horizon.;2017-10-18 19:45:00;Seconds;White luminous oblong disk speeding across Old Metairie, LA, sky from West to East, midway horizon. Last night between 7:30--7:45 PM, I was sitting in my living room, in an upper apartment level that faces the southern sky over West Napoleon Avenue in Old Metairie, LA.  My living room has a large glass sliding door that leads to a porch, and a large picture window, all facing south.  My recliner faces both these windows.   Suddenly I saw a glowing, luminous white, oblong shaped disk, streak across the sky at an incredible speed midway or a little higher above the horizon.  It traveled from West to East.  By the time I jumped up and crossed the few feet to reach the glass door window, it had disappeared from sight.   For years now, I have been able to see airplanes, jets, helicopters flying in the sky from this view.  None of them were ever shaped like this, glowed, or traveled at such speed.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
