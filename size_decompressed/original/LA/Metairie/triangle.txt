High flying jet that has no contrails.;2014-01-09 16:07:00;10 seconds;a high flying jet that has no contrails Special report-date:  Friday, 9 January, 2014 time: 4:07 P.M.    Saw what appeared to be a jet aircraft at cruising altitude, flying east to west.  Altitude at better than 30,000 feet.  No exhaust contrails to be seen streaming from behind the aircraft.  Visual speed appeared to be greater than what would be expected of a conventional jet at that altitude.   Some ten seconds after visually watching a very high flying jet, the aircraft rises to a brilliant speck, then disappears completely from visual view in a cloudless blue sky!  Aircraft configuration similar to most high flying jets, but with some visual differences.  No noise from the aircraft due to its very high altitude, concomitant with very high altitude jets.   Obviously, the aircraft is not powered by jet engines, but powered by some other propulsive technology.  Jet aircraft at that altitude always produce streaming exhaust contrails.   After a brilliant burst of light, the aircraft completely disappears.  Speculation:  The aircraft makes a sharp upturn, and goes to space!  This explains why, in a very clear sky, the aircraft visually disappears instead of continuing its east-west trajectory.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
