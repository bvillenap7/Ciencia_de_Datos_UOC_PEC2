Off-white ball zoomed across the southern sky;2005-03-13 01:00:00;5 seconds;Off-white ball zoomed across the southern sky While sitting on our patio (between 12:30am and 1:30am on 3/13/05) we witness an off-white ball zoom across the southern sky.  It seemed to come from nowhere and then just disappear.  There was no sound and no trail behind it.   We live in a flight path but this was no plane (no sound, no blinking lights, fast, smooth).

Bright Orange light flys incredibly quickly across New Orleans sky.;2008-04-29 03:30:00;5-10 seconds;Bright Orange light flys incredibly quickly across New Orleans sky. I observed a bright orange light go from one side (east) of the sky to the other(west) in significantly under 10 seconds. I brought my friends attention to it in the first 2-3 seconds, and he then observed it as well. It made a slight shift right after direct center from east to west, then continued in a new straight line from that point. The total time was well under 10 seconds, but I would guess over 5 seconds. There were several people sitting near us at the levee, and we asked if they saw it as well, and they said that they had. The speed was absolutely inconcievable to my mind. I do not know the height relative to earth to estimate a speed, but the object was clearly further than the clouds, but either within the earth's atmosphere, or BARELY without (I am quite sure it was well within the earth's atmopshere, but do not want to swear to it, and make the sighting loose legitimacy for lack of exact knowledge on this particular detail.  The light was clear the entire time, and the speed was, frankly, unbelievable. It went from near due east to near due west, across the entire sky in well under 10 total seconds.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
I saw 2 Bright Orange Lights which seemed to stay in one place.;2013-12-10 22:20:00;5 minutes;I saw 2 Bright Orange Lights which seemed to stay in one place When I was driving home from work tonight around 10:20pm I noticed 2 very bright orange colored lights in the sky . At first I thought they were airplanes but they were not moving and were extremely bright and seemed to stay in one place for 5 or more minutes. I lost them behind the trees when I was exiting the elevated part of the I-10  and  was back on ground level. I have seen lights like this about a month ago but there were 3 and seemed to be in some type of formation. Not sure if it could be military but they did not act like planes and were very bright.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085

I saw what appeared to be a star but it was still sunny, so i thought that was strange.   I pointed it out to my little girl and said, look at the star.  I continued to watch it.  As i did it stared to flicker and then it just faded out.  I thought that was peculiar.  Never witnessed anything like it before.  Thank you for this forum.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
Watched high-altitude plane follow a bright ball of light SE across the sky.;2015-08-19 21:19:00;1 minute;Watched high altitude plane follow a bright ball of light SE across the sky. Near Louis Armstrong International Airport, there was a high orbit bright ball of light.  Thought it was a star, at first, then noticed it was moving.   About 15-20 seconds later a high altitude plane was following it.  It was heading SE towards Old Metairie.  It was not headbeam reflection.   It was two distinct craft, the craft, and the plane following it.  If you've ever seen a satellite fly over, that's what it appeared to be in shape/size/brightness.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
I was walking on Meadowdale St. by St. Ann's church when I saw a bright white light move in an arc across the sky w/ a dimmer white.;2016-01-13 18:27:00;3-5 seconds;I was walking on Meadowdale street by St. Ann's church when I saw a bright white light move in an arc across the sky with a dimmer white light following above and behind it.  The light in the foreground was about as bright as a star, but the light behind it was dimmer.   The object was not a plane as by comparison there were planes in the background.  The light left no trail so it did not appear to be a meteor.  The lights appeared, moved in an arc and then vanished all in a matter of seconds.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
Apparent star changes color and moves then winks out.;2017-03-19 20:30:00;30 seconds;Apparent star changes color and moves then winks out. I went outside to see if the sky was clear enough to do some observing with my telescope.  I looked to the south & saw what I thought were 2 stars, when the lower one changed color from white to orange/red, when it began to move upwards in the direction of the top star (which I later identified as Sirius).  As it moved closer to Sirius, it started to dim, until it went out altogether.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
