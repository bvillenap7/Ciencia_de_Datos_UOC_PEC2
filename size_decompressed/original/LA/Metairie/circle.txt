UFO over Lake Ponchatrain--1994.  ((anonymous report));1994-08-01 09:00:00;30-45 seconds;UFO over Lake Ponchatrain - 1994 In the summer of 1994 a friend came to pick me up at the end of Clearview from apartments.  I was living in @ the time.  We were driving down Clearview and I saw a lot of different multi-coloured lights in the sky that were stationary. I was excited and told him to follow the lights.  We ended up at the other end of Clearview – he parked the car, we got out and went over the bankement.  There was this huge circular object with multi-coloured lights that was stationary in the water over Lake Ponchatrain..I am not sure how many feet it was out -- there was absolutely no noise. It stayed there for maybe 30-45 seconds, then started moving very slowly towards the bank where I & my friend were standing -- I started running towards it… but I just couldn’t get close enough.  My friend and I then ran up on the bank to watch it slowly leave and literally disappear without a trace. There were other people that night who had seen the same thing – they were standing further down from my friend and I.  I want to say at least six people maybe more.  I wish I would have spoken to them. I cried after the experience – it was extremely overwhelming and impacted me for a short time in my life. I have never seen anything like that before or since in my life.  I hope I do see it again one day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Single object hovering over Lake Ponchartrain Louisiana.;2013-11-10 17:00:00;15 minutes;Single object hovering over Lake Ponchartrain Louisiana. My wife and I were driving side by side in seperate cars heading home towards Lake Ponchartrian when we both noticed at the same time, 3 bright objects flying in a triangular formation over the lake.   She called me from her car asking me if I was seeing the same objects that she was which I did.   We quickly drove to the lake, got out of our cars, and ran up the levee where one single object was left hovering over the lake.   I got out my cell phone, and was fortunate enough to capture an 11 second clip of the incident.   It hovered in place for about 10 minutes changing colors rapidly, and moving in an erratic pattern.  The object gradually drifted away at a slow pace toward the horizon.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
Silver saucer with red light on top and green light on bottom.;2014-08-29 17:40:00;5 minutes;Silver saucer with red light on top and green light on bottom. When I pulled into my driveway at home I noticed something hovering in the sky across the street.  My oldest daughter had my cell phone for the past week so I was unable to photograph it.  When I stood at the end of my driveway it was across the street located by the railroad tracks and water plant, it hovered at the tree tops, it was a bright silver with a red light on top and a green light on bottom and remained it that spot for at least 5 minutes, then I went inside.  My mother came over and said did you see that thing in the sky and I said yes, is it still there?  She replied, yes, I went to look at it with her and it was gone.  It showed up the next day around the same time and I have not seen it since.  I have my phone back and I want to see it again so I can get pictures to post.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
very large 3 bright circles, 3 different colors, low in the sky;2019-11-28 18:00:00;10-15 seconds;very large 3 bright circles, 3 different colors, low in the sky On or about November 28 I was sitting on my chair on my front porch around 6pm.  It was a clear night there were no clouds visible in the sky.  About 5 minutes later I noticed 3 bright circles, one blue, one green, one burnt orange, appearing in the western sky.  I observed these circles for about 10 - 15 seconds, then they shot off in a south easterly direction.  I jumped up and ran to the end of my driveway to see if  could still see them. There was no sight of the 3 objects.  There is a tree about 30 feet tall. The objects were seen approximately 50 feet above this tree.  In viewing the circular objects I had been able to see the top of the tree.  Compared to the moon these objects were at least 10 times larger. The next morning I saw search lights moving across the area where I had seen the 3 objects.  These search lights continued to operate for the next 4 or 5 days.  Possibly these objects had appeared on their radar, probably trying to confirm if they were still in the area. This event occurred in Metairie, LA between West Napoleon Ave., the South I-10 Service Road, and Metairie Heights Ave., Gatehouse Apartment complex.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
