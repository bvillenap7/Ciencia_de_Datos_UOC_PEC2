My friend and I were heading back to his house from the gas station when we observed an unusual occurence.  It appeared to be a jagged an awkwardly shaped private jet with two pairs of wings.  It was flying much too low for its distance from the airport.  It hardly made any noise and didn't have the regulatory green and red wing lights.  The bottom was fully lit up.  The craft appeared to be a shimmery charcoal grey.  My friend and I couldn't believe it and were filled with unease and curiosity.  We tailed the craft for a few blocks.  It made sharp unwavering turns like a helicopter before finally making its way toward Kenner (where the airport is).  It was too far to be that low.   As we neared Cleary, we ran into a friend of ours and gave him a ride home.  After bringing up the strange plane, our mutual friend took the words out of our mouths about witnessing this strange occurence.  He too felt the same gut-wrenching discomfort and curiosity.  It was unreal.   My family has lived here our whole lives and not once witnessed something like that.  My father was just speculating the other day that if aliens exist and have been working with our government, their craft may look more humanized by nowâ€¦;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
2 Orange Rocket like plumes in sky silent & still for 15 minutes.;2018-01-23 22:40:00;~15 minutes;2 Orange Rocket like plumes in sky silent & still for 15 minutes. The weather was light overcast with spotty clouds.  The 2 UFO's I saw were due west and the 1st was approximately 45 degrees straight up from the crescent moon on my horizon about to set.  It was orange and vertically oriented looking like the plume of a rocket, but was perfectly still.  Its apparent size if holding at arms length was 1.25 high by .25 thick in the middle symmetrically tapering off upward & downward to a point (like a classic saucer oriented vertically but not metallic, it was rocket exhaust like)  Within 3 or 4 minutes of seeing the 1st one another slowly faded in above and to the right of the 1st object.  It looked exactly the same but not quite as bright.  About  2 or 3 minutes later the 2nd object slowly faded out, then about 5 minutes later the original object slowly faded out as well.  The whole time both objects were silent and still in the sky and still in respect to each other. I tried taking photo's with my cell phone but they didn't come out.   I have lived on the same property all my life and have never witnessed anything like that before.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
