What seemed to be a morning star dimmed the light and disappeared;2020-10-14 07:13:00;1 minute;What seemed to be a morning star dimmed the light and disappeared was in the car on my way to work heading north on Causeway Blvd in Metairie and I saw a star in the morning sky, my thought was that the star was quite bright, it was warm white light, then I saw that it dimmed the light and I could still see an object there, it was a little darker than the sky, it got brighter again, but then dimmed the  light and disappeared. I was able to look at that spot for several more minutes before the car had to turn and object didn’t show again.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
Spherical Light UFO traveling low, fast, and making quick turns.;2021-08-12 22:05:00;4 seconds;Spherical Light UFO traveling low, fast, and making quick turns. Today, while taking a walk near my apartment near the canal on West Napoleon Street in Metairie, LA, I was looking to the west towards New Orleans International Airport expecting to see some airplanes in the distance.  After about a second of looking in that direction, I saw something flying much lower and closer than I was expecting to see.  The object I saw seemed to be about only a couple hundred yards away,  about 100 feet in altitude, 5-10 feet in diameter sphere of white light, and was going extremely fast (at such a low altitude: appx. 100 mph by my estimation) and making drastic turning maneuvers without making any noise.  After watching the object turn abruptly to start going over a residential area, the sphere of light “turned off” in the matter of a few tenths of a second. The object seemed to “be” light as I was not able to see any physical trace of the object after it disappeared. That was the last I saw of it.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
