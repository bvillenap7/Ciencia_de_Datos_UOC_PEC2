Very large, shiny object hovering near the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway near New Orleans;2009-01-13 16:15:00;4-5 seconds;Very large, shiny object hovering near the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway near New Orleans At about 4:15 p.m. on a clear, sunny day, I had just exited the interstate and was approaching a long, sharp curve in the road. Out of the top, right corner of my windshield, I noticed a very large, very shiny, silver object in the sky, absolutely frozen in place. Compared to how the sun appears in the sky, the object was maybe one-and-a-half times as wide and one-fourth to one-third as high. I watched it for as long as I could, which was maybe four to five seconds. I had to take my eyes off it to negotiate the curve. When I came out of the turn a few seconds later, the object should have been directly in front of me, but it was gone. The object appeared to have been a little way out over Lake Pontchartrain, near the Causeway, just outside of New Orleans. This would put it a few miles from the airport, but thereâ€™s no way it was a jet or plane. It was much too big, much too shiny, and it never moved during the time I saw it.;29.9939339869281;-90.1659614379085
