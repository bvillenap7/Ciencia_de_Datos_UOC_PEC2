Round object producing multicolored lights all around.;2015-09-09 21:50:00;4-5 minutes;Round object producing multicolored lights all around. A neighbor friend was walking her dog and was watching something in the sky.  This person called me and requested I meet her out toward the street so I said give me a minute and I'll be out there.  When I walked up she pointed up towards the Northwestern sky and said what's that.  My first thought is that there is usually a gaseous sun/planet in that direction (the size of a pinpoint normally).  However, this was about 3 to 4 times the size of that planet and round like a planet.  It was throwing out all sorts of light, white, yellowish/orangish, red, bluish and even looked as though it moved slightly to the North but I thought the movement could've been due to the light coming off from the side of this thing.  We watched it outside for several minutes and I asked her if she wanted to a take a ride a few miles up the road to get a look at it from an area that doesn't have a lot of trees as it wasn't quite to the horizon line yet.  We both went to lock up our! homes and when we came out (not five minutes later) it was completely gone.  We took a ride due west about three miles to the tree clearing and there was nothing at all in that area of the sky.  We had some wispy light clouds in the area but you could see through them and there were no big fluffy or light blocking clouds in that direction at all.  I have been out the past two nights and have seen the usually planet in that direction but it is nowhere near the size or throwing off the colors of whatever was there on 9-9-15.  We both know it wasn't a plane as it was mainly stationary while we watched it and it didn't have aircraft type lights on it.  It also wasn't a satellite passing over.;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
