Silent orange/red illuminated jagged spherical object moved across the sky and disappeared;2011-08-12 23:27:00;1 minute;Silent orange/red illuminated jagged spherical object moved across the sky and disappeared Brightly illuminated orange/red moving light.  Not exactly spherical in nature had a somewhat jagged (possibly starlike) shape to it.  Appeared just above the trees in a large subdivision in Mandeville, LA. The object was far brighter than any stars in the sky and moved in a straight line across the sky.  The object appeared to have bright white lights that illuminated the sky above it.  There was no sound.  Completely silent.   The object flickered back and forth between extremely bright and just bright.  Then, it continued along its linear path and began to dim.  The naked eye could still make out the outline of the object but it no longer was illuminated.   We followed the object with our eyes until it appeared to disappear among the cloud cover or maybe just disappeared altogether. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Redish/Orange orbs/sphere shaped objects floating by home in sets of two;2012-12-31 23:00:00;45 minutes;Redish/Orange orbs/sphere shaped objects floating by home in sets of two Went outside between porch and driveway at 11PM New Years Eve to determine if any neighbor's had begun to popoff fireworks.  Not soon after looking around I noticed a redish/orange orb/sphere appeared in the sky coming in from my South and heading over the treeline of my neighbor's home across the street heading into a dark cloud bank to my North.  Right after seeing the first organe/red orb a second appeared coming from the same direction and passing over my house and heading into the Northern cloud bank the first orb had gone into.  Both orbs were the same redish orange color and did not change color or make any noise as they passed overhead.  I would think that both were the size of my kitchen area, 12'x12'.  Within just a few minutes another two orbs exactly the same as the first two came into my site and followed the same flight path as first described.  For the next 30 to 45 minutes I witnessed at least 16 to 20 of these redish orange orbs/sphere shape! d objects float over my house and the neighbor's across the street in sets of 2 every 3 to 5 minutes and disappear into a cloud bank to my North.  None of the orbs changed color or shape or were different in appearance from any of the others and none of them made any noise at all.  No one was outside at all on my small block area to witness what I saw and I have never seen any orbs prior to that date nor since.;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
Spherical shape object flying silently at approximately 400 knots over Mandeville, LA, at an approximate altitude of 15,000 ft agl.;2015-01-01 00:12:00;20 seconds;Spherical shape object flying silently at approximately 400 knots over Mandeville, LA, at an approximate altitude of 15,000 ft agl. My wife, daughter and myself observed a spherical shaped object flying at approximately 15,000 ft agl, moving on an approximate 190 degree heading on the approach path to KMSY (Louis Armstrong airport in New Orleans).   Estimated speed was around 400 knots.  As it approached the 30 mile mode c veil for KMSY, it rapidly changed its heading to approximately 270, accelerated and disappeared within 5 seconds.  The entire event lasted approximately 20 seconds. It appeared to maintain its altitude during the entire observed path.  It was orange to orange/red in color that pulsed/shimmered that change the hue of its colors.   It appeared to be completely silent as it traversed the airspace I described above.;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
Two orange orb/spheres witnessed separately, an hour apart, by two family members.;2017-03-17 21:30:00;6 seconds;Two orange orb/spheres witnessed separately, an hour apart, by two family members. This is a report about two sightings an hour apart.  As it is St. Patrick's Day, I would like to state that neither myself nor my mother drink or had taken any medications.   Tonight was an absolutely clear night, with no clouds or wind in this area, and very good view of the stars.   We had been out running errands and had a meal and as I was the driver today I had just dropped my mother off at her house and I stopped at the stop sign at the end of mom's block to make my turn and noticed to my east right about 9:30 pm an unusual colored light not to far off.   At first, I thought is it a helicopter, but the light wasn't red, it was a very bright orange, about the size of a large beach ball, perfectly illuminated all the way around, solid orange color.  The orb/sphere sized light was traveling North towards my mom's house, so I rolled down my window to listen and there was no noise.  It didn't resemble a plane, helicopter, Chinese lantern, drone or a balloon and was flying level about 300 to 400 feet over the treeline.   I reversed my car back to mom's house and as I pulled up into her driveway the orb/sphere disappeared over her house/neighbor's house (I probably witnessed the orb for a total of 10 seconds).   I got mom back outside (as she has seen this orange orb several years ago and reported it on this site then) and we watched the skies for about 10 minutes and did not see a thing other than planes passing high above.  I went home and did not witness anything else on the ride home. However, nearly one hour later, mom would have a second sighting.  Mom forgot to bring and snailmail a couple of bills so she left to drop them off at the post office at around 10:25 pm.  She gets to the corner stop sign (right where I witnessed the orb an hour earlier) and sees the exact same thing coming from the east.  She stated that the bright orange light was about the size of large ball and was going from her east to the north and disappeared in the same way.  She stated that it didn't come as close as her home but was further away.  She also rolled her window down and never heard a sound.  She also stated it wasn't a balloon, plane, helicopter and she didn't think it was a drone either.  Neither one of us know what this orange light is.;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
