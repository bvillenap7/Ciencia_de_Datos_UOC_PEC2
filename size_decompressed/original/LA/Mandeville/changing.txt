Red fire lights over covington/mandeville;2013-04-21 20:00:00;2 minutes;Red fire lights over covington/mandeville My wife and I were on interstate 10 between the Covington/Mandeville exit and the Pinnacle Parkway exit. I noticed in the sky 5-6 red lights. Solid not blinking.  They seemed as though they stretched from on exit to the next. perhaps a few miles. there were 3-4 in a perfect straight line going across the horizon and one underneath what would be considered the middle light.  As I watched and looked back to continue driving I looked back and noticed the farthest two lights were gone and the three main lights turned into a triangle. the triangle changed shape 2 or 3 times. (meaning the lights changed formation but still stayed in a triangle shape. looked back a minute later and they were gone.;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
