A Twenty Minute Experience @ 2:13 AM in Mandeville Louisiana;2003-09-11 02:13:00;20mins;A Twenty Minute Experience @ 2:13 AM in Mandeville Louisiana This event happened just as I looked out my window... I was looking closely at Mars and there for a few seconds there was an object  I thought was na airplane light. On further observation this object suddenly became clearer and there it was a Triangular Shaped  with three red lights each on the tips of the pointed angles...I had my binoculars handy and looked closer. The object had a n unusual metal type appearance and it seemed to hover for awhile... Unfortunately I did not have a video camera because the lights and shape were very distinctive and would have produced a really visible image... I felt a chill up my spine and eary feeling fell over me... Almost  doomlike yet excited that this maybe a UFO... Varied thoughts passed through my mind which elevated fear I have never felt before... I felt like  something was reading my mind and then an image crossed in it and I sensed and could see through my mind's eye an image and also a sound of something near...I froze for a moment or two and then a sudden air of heat came over me and then the object in the sky was gone...I had pinched myself and had gotten myself a glass of water to get back to the evening's reality... I was stunned yet an overwhelming calm came over me and I felt safe...This is the first account I have ever experienced and have some heavy thoughts that seem difficult to dispell...Today, I sat quietly and pondered whether or not I should tell anyone.  I feel a release and also relieved that this site exist. so that my experience can be told...I am not sure that what I saw was a UFO, but for now it seems so...;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
Saw a trianguler shaped craft while driving home.;2009-11-28 05:30:00;10 minutes;Saw a trianguler shaped craft while driving home. Driving down a straight stretch of Highway 59 in Mandeville at 5:30 A.M. and saw this bright light ahead in the sky, roughly the size of a planet.. I got closer and then thought it was some kind of helicopter just sitting stagnant in the sky,.. as I drove closer, I noticed it was moving, and I eventually got a real close profile view of it.. I couldn't stop staring at it, I had never seen any kind of aircraft in my life. it was triangular shaped with lights,.. didn't make a noise.  TR-3B Astra is the closest description I'm getting. This is pretty much exactly what I saw:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdwSWdmEf7A;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
