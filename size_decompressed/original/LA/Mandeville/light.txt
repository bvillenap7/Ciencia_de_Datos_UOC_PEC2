seen lights that looked like stars playing;2006-04-09 22:00:00;5 sec.;seen lights that looked like stars playing This is the second sighting my wife has seen from our balcony.  We live in a apartment and she doesn't smoke inside it so, she spends allot of time on the balcony.   About 10:55 pm 04/09/06 her and her sister were smoking and looking at the stars.  My wife seen what she said looked like to stars moving across the sky one in front of the other moving very fast.  The one in the front then looped behind the other one.  After that it looped back in front and then they dissapared.  My wife said it looked like to stars were playing.  It lasted only about 5 seconds and my wife was tring to get her sister to see it, but the sighting didn't last long enough for my wife to tell her sister where to look in the night sky.;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772

3 lights, pale green in color, traveling from southwest sky +30 deg, heading north in straight line formation.;2010-04-02 21:30:00;10-12 seconds;3 lights, pale green in color, traveling from southwest sky +30 deg, heading north in straight line formation. On 04/02/2010 at approximately 21:30 I was out with my cousin stargazing.  We started the night looking at the Orion nebula.  I have a book of star charts and had my head in it trying to see what else in the area would be interesting to look at.  My cousin pointed to an area in the west southwest sky (Taurus the bull)  I pulled my head from the book to look in the direction she was pointing.  From the left of Taurus +30 deg heading due north toward Polaris were three dull green lights traveling at a rate at that of a satellite.  We were only able to track the lights for about 10 seconds before they were lost behind the trees in my backyard.  I immediately began looking for a logical explanation as to what they were.  I have been actively stargazing for the last five years and in that time I have seen many satellites.  Never have I seen satellites traveling in this pattern(unless NASA has launched some sort of weather satellites I wasn’t aware of).  The pale ! green color was also an abnormal color which I have never seen in an orbiting satellite.  To put it simply this event has rendered me clueless as to what myself (Age 31) and my Cousin (Age 9) saw.  One other side note as to the shape of the lights they were orb shaped.  they were like what one would see when the space shuttle would pass over head bit at a much lower magnitude in brightness.  As for the distance apart from each other  If you would hold your hand at arms length and make the victory symbol(or peace sign)and measure the distance apart from your index to your middle finger, that’s the distance they were apart.  From the ground they looked like the following demonstration:    (  .           .             . )   Please do not treat this as a false report.  If anyone who reads can present to me a logical explanation to what we saw, I invite your reply.  I am not reporting this looking for attention in any way.  I, for now am treating this event for what it was: an! Unidentified Flying Object.  Until it is otherwise identified! it will remain a UFO, Not aliens or visitors from far off, but simply a UFO.  Thank you for taking the time to read this report.  Sorry, one more side note.  there were no aircraft in the area, and no beacons or strobes to indicate that they were aircraft. It is so quite around my house at night you can hear a plane even when at its cruising altitude.  I know these were not planes.  Regards,  Computer Engineer;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
White round light becoming bright/slightly larger, stopping, turning bluish/white and fading out.;2012-08-16 23:50:00;7 seconds;White round light becoming bright/slightly larger, stopping, turning bluish/white and fading out. Walking dog North up my street and looking into North/Northwestern sky at a set of stars that form a triangle when a round white light caught my eye (looked to be above 20,000 ft in sky) approaching the triangle of stars.  The light was slightly brighter (about 15/20%) than the stars I was looking at and was heading west along the same line of sight.  I stopped walking to watch this light thinking is was probably a plane which may have changed direction and began heading toward me (as I live on a direct flight path to an international airport) as the light became brighter (10/15%)and slightly larger, then stopped, then turned a sort of slight bluish/white and dimmed as if to blend in with the stars I was looking at and finally the light completely faded out (all within about 7 seconds).  I stood there on my street watching this area to see if I could locate any blinking lights afterward for about a minute and saw absolutely nothing (no white/green or red bli! nking lights) that you would find on a plane had it turned it's main light off.  There are some clouds out tonight but there were none in the area of the sky I was watching.  Most commercial planes not heading to New Orleans airport will follow this flight path along I-12 toward Houston as I see them all the time however, I've never witnessed one of them becoming larger and brighter, stopping, dimming to a different color and then fading out altogether.  I can rule this out as a sighting of the ISS as I have witnessed this pass over my area several times and this light was nowhere near as large/bright nor was it coming from the proper direction (usually ISS passes from my NW to my SE).  Lastly, I am very familiar with the star Sirius in the sky and this light was much farther North nor is Sirius in my visibility at the hour that I witnessed this light not to mention that Sirius is also visible for hours in my area when it is out (not 7 seconds).  I have seen thousands of p! lanes flying over my area both AM & PM and never had witnessed! one wit h these unusual properties.;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
Strange moving light over Mandeville.;2014-02-09 20:15:00;2 minutes;Strange moving light over Mandeville Watching tv when out the back window saw a small violet light move slowly straight up to about 50 degrees, stop then back down below the tree line.  I was expecting it to explode thinking it may have been fireworks.   The colors switched from violet to red and some green.   When I saw it go back up, my daughter and I went into the back yard then to the driveway and watched it go way up, stop start back down then swung left about 30 degrees, came back, stopped then again went down behind the tree line.;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
Orb of light, looked like star but then shot NE like a large shooting star but looked like they hit &quotlight speed&quot after a sho;2017-11-23 22:00:00;15 seconds;Orb of light, looked like star but then shot NE like a large shooting star, but looked like they hit light speedz after a short distance.  Orb of light, looked like star but then shot NE like a large shooting star, but looked like they hit light speed after a short distance, making a ripple effect. Thanksgiving vacation to Fontainebleau State Park.  Thanksgiving night between 10:00-11:00 pm, I was sitting with some family around fire pit looking at the stars.   Seen a bright light I figured to be a star, but then all of a sudden, it created a streak of light going East, unsure about distance but it looked very far away, after the streak it created a bright light and a ripple and disappeared.  Very similar to what you would see on a movie when the ship goes tp light speed, but this was very real.;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
Bright light at 0140 a.m. bobbing in the sky, then darting extreme left, right, then back to neutral - constantly moving.;2019-12-25 01:40:00;30 minutes;Bright light at 0140 a.m. bobbing in the sky, then darting extreme left, right, then back to neutral - constantly moving. I was alone on my balcony at 0140 gazing at the stars on a clear night and a bright light(what I thought was a star) caught my attention.  Then, I noticed it was bobbing in a vague shadow circular type of hole or space between the stars.  I watched for 3o min. and noticed it was never stationary, it was always bobbing, then I became intrigued when the light suddenly darted at a precise 90 degree angle, returned to the neutral position continued bobbing, then darted rapidly extreme left, back to center (neutral), then a couple of minutes later it darted extreme right, back to center, bobbed for about 4 minutes, then darted upward in a precisional straightline straight up and remained bobbing at the top of the dark area (hole) in the sky.  What was interesting is that the movements were so well calculated and straightline.  At one point when it was bobbing I thought it was a light moving to music.  I fully expected I would see it go shooting off into the atmosphere, but it didn't.  Instead, it inched around at the top of the dark space or hole in the sky and continued bobbing around but never left the space where it was positioned in the shadow zone. In fact, the light or craft behaved as if there were boundaries in the dark shadow zone and was always remaining within those boundaries.  At one point the light skirted around the top of the dark shadow area.  So best way to describe it is that it remained in it's neutral zone and moved in calculated straightline movements never leaving the circular dark area between the stars. The light was far enough away that I could not determine anything more than just a bright light that appears round. I recall last year hearing a radio show (George Noori) conversation with military pilots discussing UFO's darting around their aircraft when they were in flight one night.  This sighting I had on Christmas morning at 0140 was very similar to the military pilots had! described insofar as the erratic and sudden movement of the U! FO's the y had sighted one night. Decided to report this given the very peculiar movement of the bright light that I sighted 18 hours ago.;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
