I was sitting in a chair in my backyard brushing my dogs and talking on my cell phone occasionally.  I took a break and leaned back in my chair scanning the southern sky for a few minutes when what I first thought was a plane entered my view.  This object flew in a straight line from my western point to an eastern point in about 6 seconds.  The object looked like a commercial plane (say 727 size) from underneath it. As this object was flying across my view the underbelly of it was lite up (white metallic looking) which I thought was probably from the way the sun was hitting it from underneath as dusk was approaching. In my estimation the object was flying at a lower altitude (10,000 to 15,000 feet) as I could tell the body resembled that of a plane's size.  Two things really stood out at this time:  first, this object had no wings (I repeated this several times to myself) and second, it had none of the underbelly lights (red/green) that you would see on a commercial airliner.  To say truthfully, I was shocked and kept saying how can this be a plane as it doesn't have any wings.  I stepped outside of my backyard area to attempt to listen for any noise as it began to go out of my view to the east, but I live in a condo and there were 3 airconditioners running within a 20 ft area of me so I couldn't hear anything other than the a/c.  I live on the flight paths to both the N.O. International and Regional airports and see planes around me all the time and have never seen one flying without wings.

My birthday party was happening and me and my friends were hanging around and shooting the basketball in my front yard. We shot the ball for about 10 to 15 minutes when there was this giant flash of light in the air.  At first all of us were blinded by the light, when we got our sight back there were 3 crafts flying very fast and very low to the ground. We could barely make out the shapes of the vehicles before they were out of sight, all we saw were 3 very fast, cigar shaped crafts flying very close to the ground.  The light that was coming off the vehicle woke up a lot of neighbors and blurred our vision.  The power in our house and all of the houses around us flickered for about 2 minutes before it finally turned back on.  None of our car engines would turn on for at least 10 minutes.    Everyone was stunned and shocked at what just happened because it has never happened to anyone of us before.    I can honestly say that this was the scariest thing I have ever witnessed before in my life.   Hopefully you can explain to me and my friends what we saw exactly.;30.3997371501272;-90.0556893129772
