Objects over northern DeSoto Parish,  Louisiana  1983;1983-06-30 18:00:00;5 mins;Objects over northern DeSoto Parish,  Louisiana  1983 I was going home to a rural area near Shreveport Louisiana with my 7 year old son when I noticed two lights in the sky in the direction I was traveling. They were at a pretty high altitude because I could see them well up and over the tree line. They were a good distance apart so I immediately thought they were a couple of planes either heading for Shreveport Regional Airport or Barksdale Air Force Base.  I took my attention back to the road since it was at dusk dark and proceeded to drive on south towards my home and in the direction of the lights. I could no longer see them due to the trees along the road.  When I got about a quarter mile from my house I came to a clearing in the trees that allowed a good view to the east and when I looked up at the darkening sky I saw the lights again. This time I saw they were not just lights. They were two objects, eliptical in shape, almost oval, and had three lights emitting from them. One of them was rotating on a center axis but neither was moving horizontal or vertical.  I stopped to get a better look and I saw various planes flying around the objects with the familiar red and green lights but the lights on the objects were white, yellow, and red.  My son became frightened at the excitement in my voice so I drove on home.  I ran in to get my wife to come out and look since I estimated the objects were at least 4 to 5 thousand feet up and would have been plainly visible from my home but when we ran back out they were gone.  I looked every night after that for a long time in the same area where they were and never saw them again. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.
