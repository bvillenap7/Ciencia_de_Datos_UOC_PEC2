While attempting to make a phone call I began staring at the moon (it was waxing at a half crescent).  I cancelled the call and scrolled the sky until I was at about an 80 degree angle just north of the moon.  A brighter than usual star (maybe -1 mag.) caught my attention.  It was moving east to west at a fairly high rate of speed.  It was circular in shape and white in color.  There was no trail what so ever.  I assumed it was a satellite and decided to watch it until it disappeared from the horizon.  After several seconds I was astonished.  The object slowed and than at that instant, it made a 90 degree direction change and accelerated to an astonishing speed.  It was out of sight in a second or fraction of.  As for my background, I have a BS in biology and chemistry and currently work as an analytical chemist for a local company.  I have NEVER experienced any sightings before and though I support MUFON (probably the only Louisiana member) I am a scientist and I try to take an unbiased look at everything.  In the case of this sighting, scientifically, it could have possibly been a meteor being deflected in the atmosphere but there was NO BURN TRAIL and the way it varied its speed was just remarkable. ((NUFORC Note:  Artificial satellites do not have a westerly component to their groundtrack, so the object could not have been a satellite, if the estimate of direction by the witness is correct.
