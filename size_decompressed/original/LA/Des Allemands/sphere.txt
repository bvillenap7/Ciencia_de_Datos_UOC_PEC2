four round balls in the shape of a square moving speratically;2009-12-10 19:27:00;18 minutes;four round balls in the shape of a square moving speratically :: the lights looked exactly like the one I put at the beginning of this except they were sort of, I guess u would say, playing tag. If that makes any since. one would movfe from one side to the other, switching spots very quickly. the didnt have any particular pattern, it just seemed that they moved to wherever they wanted to go I have never seen anything like it. me and my husband, were almost hypnotized by the beautiful designs that were making in the sky. it was almost like watching the things u see in movies but alot more real.
