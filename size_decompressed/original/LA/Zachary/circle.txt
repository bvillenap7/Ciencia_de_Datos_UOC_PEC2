I rushed outside  and was amazed at what I saw.  Looking to the east, I  immediately saw 5 round shape reddish-orange objects in the sky, and they kept coming one after the other, totalling around  13.  They were at a steady  speed as they moved from the east to the west disappearing  midway!  With mix emotions from being  excited to afraid I didn't record the beginning but the end.
