Extremely bright/reflective object very high in the evening sky, stationary.;2014-07-22 19:10:00;10 seconds;Extremely bright/reflective object very high in the evening sky, stationary. I was riding my motorcycle west on Hwy 429 around 7:00 to 7:15 in the evening of July 22, 2014, and to the southwest of my position was a round silver craft, extremely high in the sky and very far.  It was not moving to the best of my knowledge.   I watched the craft for 10 to 15 seconds as best I could while on a motorcycle, until I lost view of it because of trees.  Once I cleared the trees, I could no longer find it in the sky.   I have noticed a lot of military helicopters in the area lately but did not see anything with the craft.  I ready didn't think anything of the helicopters, until I read the post from Baton Rouge,   I am really skeptical when it comes to this type of stuff.  But I know what I saw.;30.2369;-90.8395
