Bright, dome shaped object observed.;1974-04-15 20:00:00;60 seconds;Bright, dome shaped object observed. Returning from Shreveport to Natchitoches, LA, following a golf tournament with my high school golf team.  Traveling south on Hwy 1, just outside of Powhatten, LA.   Off to our right side, noticed a bright, white, dome-shaped object.  It was either hovering above or slightly down in a grove of trees.  Hard to tell because it was so bright.  Everyone in the van noticed it.  Tried to get our coach to stop but he wouldn't.  Watched it till we rounded the curve & lost sight of it.   There were other sightings reported in the parish on the local news the next morning. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));31.7578;-93.0908
Wedge shaped object flying low to the ground.;2003-06-15 13:00:00;60 seconds;Wedge shaped object flying low to the ground. While moving a bbq grill out on our patio, my wife & I noticed a wedge-shaped object  moving from east to west across the sky.  It was flying about the height a helicopter or small plane would fly.  It seem to have a texture to it, almost like it had heat shields like you would see on the space shuttle.   It made no noise whatsoever & it was low enough to make out details clearly.  There appeared to be a window/windshield near the front.   By the time I got my camera from the house, it had gone out of sight.  Reminded me of the space shuttle without the stubby wings & tail.
