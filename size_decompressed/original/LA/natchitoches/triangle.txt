Then the sun hit the ufo's at angle and put off the morning reflection of the sun of orange. Then 4 more shapes appeared,moving slow approx.600 ft.@ 100 mph. The six shapes flew in a 1 ,2, 3 formation on top of each other.  I was traveling southeast at 70 mph.I had a video camera in the trunk of my car but I figured if I slowed down and stopped the shapes would be gone.  Their was no rotor blades,propellers,exhaust ice crystal trails from propulsion,wings, noise ,just moving slowly to our left as I was driving southeast.The triangle polished exterior reminded me of shark fins floating.Then they moved thru the clouds disapering by 2 then 1.Then they were gone.Wish I could have stopped and gotten video.
