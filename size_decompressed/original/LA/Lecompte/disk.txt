A friend and i were playing outside about 8:00 pm when we noticed this disk shaped object moving slowly from south to north. The object was white in color. No lights were visible, just the white light of the surface of the object. We were only ten years old and were very frightened by the experience. I remember it in vivid detail until this very day. The object never made a sound or changed course. I have never told this story to anyone because I thought i would be laughed at. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));31.1094;-92.391
