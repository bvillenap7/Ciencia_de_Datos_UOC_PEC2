THERES SOMETHING WEILD GOING ON UP THERE !;2003-10-29 18:55:00;3-min.;THERES SOMETHING WEILD GOING ON UP THERE ! ON OCT. 29 AT 6:55 PM I WAS OUTSIDE LOOKING UP TO SEE WHAT I THINK IS A SATELLITE PASTING OVER MY HOUSE. I'VE SEEN IT FOR 3-YEARS NOW IT GOES FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND LOOKS LIKE A DIM STAR BUT THIS TIME WHEN I SEE IT OUT OF NOWHERE WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A DIM STAR THAT WAS NOT MOVING STARTED TO MOVING AFTER THE SATELLITE WENT BY IT. NEXT THING I SEE WAS IT GETTING RIGHT NEXT TO THE SATELLITE THE HOLE TIME THEY BOTH ARE MOVING SOUTH. THEN THE UNKNOWN LIGHT TURNED EAST AND BEGAN MOVING VERY FAST. THE SATELLITE WAS STILL GOING SOUTH. THE REASON I THINK THE LIGHT THAT MOVES FROM NORTH TO SOUTH IS A SATELLITE IS PASTS OVER AT THE SAME TIME. BUT THE OTHER LIGHT WAS NO PLANE AND NO SATELLITE. I KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MOVING TILL THE OTHER LIGHT WENT BY IT. ONE MORE THING THERE WAS NO SOUND.;30.236;-92.2599
Seven star like objects!;2008-03-25 20:30:00;30 min.;Seven star like objects! We were out looking for the space station, which was scheduled to be seen over our town at about 8:30 pm.  We saw the space station pass and were about to go back in the house when we noticed a star like object moving across the sky from west to east, we were, like whats that, a sattelite is moving also?  Then another one passed, and another, I thought,what the hell is going on, there were 7 total that passed after the space station, 6 of them from west to east, and one from east to north west!  I know it wasn't planes, there were no blinking lights, just looked like flying stars, moving really fast! Then there were three planes flying by, one plane seem to be chasing the third object! Can you explain this?;30.236;-92.2599

As I was walking up to my driveway I noticed a growing ball of white light at least 5 times as brighter than a normal star.   The light then shot across the sky at a 45 degree angle south to north then got even brighter and  disappeared.;30.236;-92.2599
