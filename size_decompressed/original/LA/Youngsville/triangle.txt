I was on the back patio grilling dinner around 19:30 on Friday 23 May 14. Being a pilot by trade, I notice in the east northeast sky a set of 3 red lights formed in a triangle.  The formation looked perfect flying, equal spacing. The formation was moving in a northern direction slowly and without any noise. Only red lights and not aircraft position lights (red on left, green on right, white on rear)   Eventfully flew away and faded into the night sky, not fast moving!;30.1012;-92.0112
