A bright light came through the ceiling and paralyzed me and my friend.;1987-06-01 00:00:00;15 Sec.;A bright light came through the ceiling and paralyzed me and my friend. Approx. 20 years ago, I was 16 years old and spending the night with my best friend.  As we were laying in bed getting ready to go to sleep, A bright white light came through the ceiling and landed upon us.  We were both immediately paralyzed and filled with a sensation of peace and happiness, a feeling well beyond anything from this world.  It filled us and the room for approx. 15 seconds before leaving through the ceiling.  After we were able to move, I asked him if he seen and felt that and he said that he did.  We both thought at the time that we had received the holy ghost.  Now, I have almost convinced myself that the light that came through the ceiling might have came from some form of Alien Contact opposed to the holy ghost.  If anyone out their can help me better understand what happened that night I would greatly appreciated it.  That night has deeply troubled me for many years and now I owe it to myself to seek some help and understanding.   My email address is ((deleted)). Thank You ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));30.2219;-93.0259
