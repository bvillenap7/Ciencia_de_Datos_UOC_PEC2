I happend to be awake at 2:00a.m. I opened my door to see if the weather was clearing up because it had been raining all day and most of the night. The moon was shining through the clouds and it was bright. I noticed a whole in the clouds and I could see 4 of what I thought were stars. There were no other stars visible in any other cloud openings. It caught my attention because they were shimmering different colors. I could see a bright white, red, and green colors for sure. They weren't extremely bright, just odd looking. I watched for I guess about 2 minutes and they slowly dimmed out. Not at the exact same time, but one right after the other. It was just weird. 12/2/2009;30.3257;-92.4931

I walked out the the door to my home, located on the south of the house, and noticed a bright red flash in the west.  I stopped and looked at it, and saw it was actually flashing almost like a strobe, but without any noticeable pattern.  The colors were white, red, and green.  It was approximately 30 degrees up from the western horizon.I went back in the house and retrieved a set of binoculars, and proceeded to watch it as closely as I could.  Meanwhile, my wife and daughter had heard me running around looking for the binoculars, and followed me back out to see what I was making such a fuss over. After realizing I could not identify it with the aid of the glasses, I got my iPad and opened the Planet app, which allowed me to see where Mars, the other planets, and the stars were at that time.  They were nowhere near the object, according to the software. I watched it for a while, then went back into my home to sleep.  My wife and daughter had preceded me.  By that time, it had dropped down in the west below the tree line, so I could no longer see it flashing.;30.3257;-92.4931
