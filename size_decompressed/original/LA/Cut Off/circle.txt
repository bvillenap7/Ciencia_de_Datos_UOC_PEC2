While on our way home on Christmas night my mother and I seen some very bright lights hovering above a wooded area moving slowing south.  We were also traveling south.  It had very bright and powerful red and white rotating lights  which looked like a circular craft.  We tried to keep up with it but it started moving too quickly for us to keep up with.  I kept my eyes on it till it vanished into the night.;29.5239;-90.3346
