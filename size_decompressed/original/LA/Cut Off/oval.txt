Three small, white, round UFOs spotted in southern Louisiana.;2013-02-18 16:00:00;~1/2 an hour;Three small, white, round UFOs spotted in southern Louisiana. A few days ago, my friend and I were sitting on the porch.  All of a sudden, I see a small, white, round, flying object in the sky, moving slowly and further away.  It didn't leave any trail of any kind or make any noise.  It then disappeared. Minutes later, there was another.  Exactly  the same, but it came out of no where.  After that one disappeared into the sky, another came out of the blue, and it also disappeared. We didn't see any after that.  That was the third sighting I've had of any UFOs around my home, and it's odd because I live in a small rural town that many people don't even recognize.;29.5239;-90.3346
