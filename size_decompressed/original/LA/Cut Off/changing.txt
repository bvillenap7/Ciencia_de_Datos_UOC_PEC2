Low-flying, shape-changing aircraft seen in a small Southern Louisiana town.;2012-11-10 20:32:00;3-4 minutes;Low-flying, shape-changing aircraft seen in a small Southern Louisiana town. My mother, aunt, cousin, boyfriend and I were driving up my street earlier to go to a fair.  My mom, who is a skeptic on such things, stops the car when she sees a low-flying craft right nearby.  It was dark, so we couldn't see much except for changing, flashing lights.   The lights came from different areas of the craft, and it looked a bit like a trapezoid, but then seemed to change shape.   Getting out of the car, there was a quiet drone unlike anything I've heard before.   Soon it started flying away at incredible speed.  That's the second UFO I see close to my home, and to think so live in a town so small, most maps don't even recognize it.;29.5239;-90.3346
