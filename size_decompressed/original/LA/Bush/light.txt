New Year's Eve UFO.;2013-12-31 23:45:00;4-8 minutes;New Year's Eve UFO So I was not going to report this, I really didn't know how, but I can't shake it from my mind and after a brief google search and reading a report from the same night, similar to mine, I have no choice.   It was about 15 minutes before New Year's Day and I stepped outside to see if any neighbors were shooting fireworks.  While looking up I noticed one orangish orb coming from the south moving at a decent pace.  No flashing.  No pulsing.  Solid orange orb.  When suddenly it split into two.   Was absolutely no sound.  I live in the country and could not hear a thing.   I immediately called for my girlfriend from inside. She came running out to see the second object disappear behind a tree heading west and the first object stayed straight north.  We watched the first object until it fell behind a treeline and we could no longer see it.  It never strayed from it's straight line.  There is an airport nearby so I see regular commercial airline traffic.  This was no airplane.  It did not have its strobes on and the landing lights are bright white, not orange.  And commercial airlines most definitely do NOT split into two aircrafts.  Anyway, that's my story.  I know what I saw.;30.6134;-89.9501
