Very bright object along busy highway.;2003-10-29 22:00:00;5 sec.;Very bright object along busy highway We were traveling east on US 90 around New Iberia,LA Craft looked like a blump, bright yellow with white square lights along the side. I first spotted the craft very low along a tree line as it semmed to move out of sight behind the tree line. At that time I did not say anything about it thinking it was a very low flying plane/blump?. We traveled about five miles and the wife said why is that yellow plane flying so low as I turned to look I saw it again and then it was gone from sight as if it went behind the tree line again. I told her I had saw it a few miles backs and stopped on the road to get a better look but did not see it again.;30.0099222222222;-91.805025925926
