Streak of light appears in picture at dusk near New Iberia, LA.;2006-07-26 18:50:00;Unknown;Streak of light appears in picture at dusk near New Iberia, LA. While driving west on US90 in New Iberia,LA we were looking at the sunset just as darkness was settling in.  It was raining lightly as the cloud bank was beginning to clear the area.  My daughter asked if she could take a picture with our digital camera. I told her not to use the flash because the light reflects back at you when it hits the raindrops.  She took several pictures some of which did not comeout for various reasons.  When I downloaded the pictures to my laptop I observed a picture that had a white streak in it that was not there when we took the picture. My daughter, wife and I did not see this object in the air when the picture was taken.  The picture you will see has some streaks in it from the raindrops, but this streak of light jumps off the screen at you. There appears to be another in the distance on the right side of the photo. Object I would say is at appx 30,000 to 35,000 ft in altitude. I do not believe this to be a contrail for several reasons, I would have noticed them being an airline employee, and during this time of year contrails are not usually that visible or bright and would be visible across the pictue. Object(s) are moving towards the west, resembles a comet in appearance. Picture is being emialed to you.;30.0099222222222;-91.805025925926
