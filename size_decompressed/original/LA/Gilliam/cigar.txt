Large object hovering for 15 min before disappearing in daylight have a cellphone video off it;2018-03-09 17:30:00;10-15 minutes;Large object hovering for 15 min before disappearing in daylight have a cellphone video off it Filmed a unidentified object at 530pm on 3-9-18 .  The object was stationary at about 60 to 80 feet above ground it was about 1 to 1.5 miles away.  The object was about 200 to 300 foot long and of a very reflective silvery color with 3 reddish pink and orangish lights on top.  There was no sounds and the birds and other wildlife stopped making any noise.   I live in the country about 26 miles from Barksdale Air Force Base, where the video was filmed is open farmland.  The object did not have any exhaust emissions coming from it as far as I could tell.  It did not move or fly away as crazy as this sounds it was in my visual spectrum and then it was not.   If anyone can shed any light on what this could be it would be greatly appreciated;32.8251;-93.8293
