Oval flying object traveling north to south, seen around three times in the past two years.;2017-07-12 19:45:00;10 minutes;Oval flying object traveling north to south, seen around three times in the past two years. I was sitting on my front porch at 7:45 pm.  This is the third time in two years I've seen this oval flying white object travel in front of our home at the height of a low flying plane.  It traveled from north to south (heading toward the Gulf of Mexico).  I ran to get my daughter and a cell phone to get a photo.  It had gotten too far away by the time we ran outside.   The cell phone camera didn't pick it up.  Whenever I bring my actual camera outside with me, I never see a thing.  I just don't think it is a plane or a helicopter.  There is no sound.;29.8369;-90.9651
