Four unidentified lights in the sky.;2004-04-15 22:00:00;25 minutes;Four unidentified lights in the sky. I was driving down the road when I noticed 4 lights parallel to each other in the sky the three other passengers in my vehicle all saw it too.   I dropped two of the passengers off.  Me and the other passenger then proceded down the road and tried to get a better look at what it was.  The lights seemed to be getting closer and I was really freaked out.   They then started moving away from us we traveled farther and sat on the side of the road and just watched the lights.  We sat there for about 5 minutes or so and the lights started to go out one at a time and when there were only two lights left they went out at the same time.   The next night or so it was reported on our local television station as a UFO sighting.  The local airports and airforce bases were checked and had nothing in the sky at the time of the incident.  It was also said on the news that it was unexplainable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));30.8298;-93.2728
There was no sound.;2008-05-30 00:00:00;1 Minute;There was no sound. I was out in my front yard, about 12 miles south of DeRidder, LA.  At between 12:00 and 1:00 am, Saturday morning on May 30, 2008  I was tending to a problem with one of my puppies, then just sitting, looking at the clear night sky. As I watched the great display of celestial lights, I seen a particularly bright flash of light, like a large bright white strobe light.  It flashed at regular timed intervals of what seemed to be 3 to 4 seconds, but what was amazing, was the distance it traveled between each flash.  The distances varied, and seemed to be from miles, to hundreds of miles, depending on what it's height was, which I could not determine. This flashing and traveling continued in a  large circle of  what appeared to be from 15 degrees above the horizon, in the south, going overhead, to that same angle in the north, then returning more to the East, and back to the south again, and going out of site behind the trees in my south west.  There were about 10 or 11 flashes, in a total viewing time of 30 to 45 seconds. I am a 71 year old retired construction manager, and minister. I am a licensed private pilot.;30.8298;-93.2728
