((anonymous report));2017-04-07 11:50:00;15 seconds;Looked to be a thin light colored object with a dome shape on top.  It appeared to be stationary.   While we were trying to figure out what it could be,  It literally disappeared.  It didn't just vanish but the object became distorted by what I can best describe as heat shimmer.  Like what you see from a jet engine.   After about 2 seconds, it was gone.  It was a crystal clear blue sky, and not a single cloud in sight.
