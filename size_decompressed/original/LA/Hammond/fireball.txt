Sighting during the blood moon.;2014-10-08 04:45:00;3 seconds;Sighting during the blood moon. My friend/ boss and I were standing outside watching the eclipse and looking at the stars starting around 4:30 am on highway 190 going toward Albany.   Around 4:43 am we saw a shooting star or two which isn't uncommon, but a few minutes later we both looked up when we saw a light that had appeared out of nowhere and was just hovering there for about a second, then lit up brightly and took off north much like something out of Star Wars.    We have seen a lot of shooting stars in our day, but this actually startled us because it certainly was not even close to a comet coming into orbit.;30.4959145208131;-90.4752240077442

By the;2015-10-11 23:15:00;2 seconds;Coming from the south east moving toward the east I saw a bright flash of a green light almost arcing in the sky then cut out.  By the characteristics it could have been a meteor with copper elements, but due to an experience a few months ago I believe otherwise. The first sighting I had was about 5 months ago.  At first I thought it was artificial (fireworks) but then I realized no one lived or could have shot off something in those woods. It was the same color green and about the same amount of time, but it illuminated the trees from the time it was above them to the time it landed and illuminated from the bottom.  No sound.  No pop, just the sight.  It was about 50 yards in front of me too.  It happened at work and the woods also happened to be something of a swamp. I live near the Hammond airport on highway 190 and the second incident happend on 190 as well...but 3 miles apart.;30.4959145208131;-90.4752240077442
