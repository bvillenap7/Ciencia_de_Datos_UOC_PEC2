The light visible with the naked eye appeared redish or green or orange at points. We tried to focus on the object from the telescope and it appeared to have a darkish center. I went and got my camera, a Canon 30D with an attached 70-200mm lens. I took some photos of the object and some of a bright star to compare. The photos certainly didn't match. I caught in photos the object changing shades of color, red, orange, green were three colors I captured. The object appeared to be disc like. I still couldn't get too close with that lens so I added an extender to the lens making it 400mm. I saw the object as cigar shaped lights, I thought it was camera shake, so I took pictures of a star again to compare, the star picture was circular this was not. I appeared the object was possibly facing sideways sometimes and other times the bottom or top of the object appeared visible. I couldn't myself beleive what I was seeing I would certainly be interested in an explanation. What led me to write here was that I saw a news report of a U.F.O. in London that was spotted by an airline pilot from 40-miles out, the pilot concluded the object was a mile wide. the shape of what I saw seems to be comparable so I thought I'd share the sighting. The object was still visible when I came in to write this, I took well over 200 photos of the object.;30.4959145208131;-90.4752240077442
