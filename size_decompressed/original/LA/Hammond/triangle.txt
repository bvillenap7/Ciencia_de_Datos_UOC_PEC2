black triangular object without lights moving very slowly above treeline along I-12;2006-11-11 01:50:00;10 seconds;black triangular object without lights moving very slowly above treeline along I-12 I am a truck driver and had just made a pick-up off Hwy 190 in Hammond, LA.  As I was driving on the onramp(exit 42) to get onto I-12 west something caught my eye just over the tree tops alongside of the interstate approx. 1/8 of a mile away.  The object was a black triangular(rounded not pointed) object without any lights.  The object appeared to be moving east at a very slow speed or perhaps even hovering about 150/200ft high. The treeline on the west bound side of I-12 where the object was is about 150/200ft away from the interstate.  When I was at the closest point to the object I thought I was looking at a stealth fighter that had the capability to hover.  There was no sound and no movement in the tree tops. I-12 exit 42 is Airport Rd. The airport is approx. 5 miles from the interstate.  It is a small airport that has an Air National Guard unit there so I thought it may have been some type of military craft.  The incident lasted for 8-12 seconds.;30.4959145208131;-90.4752240077442
