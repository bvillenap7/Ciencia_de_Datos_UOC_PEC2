Three orange lights traveling high altitude, close prox. to one another, high rate of speed.;2003-08-03 22:30:00;3 Min.;Three orange lights traveling high altitude, close prox. to one another, high rate of speed. One object was spotted moving from the north to the SSW at high rate of speed and high altitude.  When tracked with binoculars, two others were seen traveling with the first.  In a triangular formation, close proximity to each other.  Same velocity and direction.  No aircraft lights were seen on the vehicles.  Only one orange light on each.  No direction change noted, maintained course until out-of-sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness observed the three satellites, which fly in formation, and which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy NOSS surveillance system.  The other object may have been a satellite, as well, although that is a guess on our part.  PD));31.4989;-92.4005
