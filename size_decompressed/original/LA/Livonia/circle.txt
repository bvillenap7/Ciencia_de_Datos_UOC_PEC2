something weird flying in the sky;2006-11-01 20:50:00;a minute or two;something weird flying in the sky Tonight while my brother,28 and I,14 went to go pick up something the crew left on the construction job, I looked up into the sky & saw what I believe was a UFO or other unexplainable thing in the sky. We had just gotten out of the truck with the headights still on. My brother didn't need my help so I was looking around and what not. I looked up into the sky & was shocked when I saw a glowing object moving slowly downward and across the sky. At first I thought it was my first shooting star or comet, but all of a sudden it took a completely different path and curved and went up. It started blinking while still moving fairly slow. Then it started glowing steadily once again. It sped up and began to dim. Then it was gone. I waited to see if it would appear again but it didn't. Before tonight, I had never believed in UFO's or weird things going on in the sky like this. But I know I wasn't just seeing things because when I saw it I yelled to my brother 'a shooting star!', so we were both witnesses. And I noticed it didnt have blue or red or any other color lights like an airplane or other ordinary flying craft. Also, it was flying pretty low, until it went up.
