Sighting in rural Louisiana, teardroped object rising and falling about 100 yards in the sky.;2009-01-06 21:30:00;10 min.;Sighting in rural Louisiana, teardroped object rising and falling about 100 yards in the sky. Last night at 9:30 pm I took the dog outside and saw the same light I see hovering over the woods quite often.  After observing the light for less than a minute, it began rapidly ascending and descending about a 100 yards up and down.  I ran into the house to grab my friend who saw the same thing.   We both a heard a noise inside the house that sounded just like my dog when it scratches the door.  The dog was outside with us.  When I opened the door to the house the car alarm went off.  I probably set the alarm off with the keys in my pocket.  There was nothing in the house.  I went back outside a few minutes later with my camera.  The object moved slightly but nothing like earlier.   A few hours later the object was moving  slowly, like a star to the west and 10 degrees higher in the sky.;30.4607;-92.8693
