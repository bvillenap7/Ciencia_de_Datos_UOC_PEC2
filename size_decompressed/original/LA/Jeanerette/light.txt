Fast moving object appears and disappears in seconds.;2006-09-25 06:30:00;3-5 seconds;Fast moving object appears and disappears in seconds. I was driving to work on Highway 90 east and saw what appeared to be a shooting star way above the horizon in the distance.  The star came out of nowhere stopped and took off and disappeared into thin air.  All I could really tell was that it was a bunch of white lights.  I thought it was a plane that was going to crash but it disappeared.  I am certain that other motorists on the highway saw this occur I just hope someone other than me reports it.;29.9058;-91.653
