When the lights stopped looked like a star. Last night I was sitting in a lawn chair just enjoying the night sky when I saw what looked like a star moving west to east about to pass up the big dipper. I thought maybe a satellite. So I ran inside and got my daughter and her friend.  Then I showed them where the object was and we were all watching it move. When it stopped and changed directions one of the girls said I thought satellites were suppose to move in one direction. Third grade stuff right? One of the lights met another that had started to move then moved apart and they both were still and did not move. If I was by myself nobody would believe me. After that a third light that looked like a star as well moved from around the dipper heading in an eastern direction. When it disappeared I went inside.  It was midnight. I know that a star is suppose to be fixed in space.  I seen two shooting stars to the east sky as the unidentified flying objects were moving in the northern sky. That was the second time I have seen something while I was in my yard.;30.2078230769231;-93.4043769230768
