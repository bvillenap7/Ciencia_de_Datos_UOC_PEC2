We live outside the city limits.  The lights were observed by myself, my husband, son and daughter in law.  We live near a small airport.  We are familiar with small planes flying over and coming in for landings.  The sky was clear.  Just before the sighting, a small plane flew over.  Facing north we observed two very bright, almost neon green lights.  The lights seemed to be on one object the way they moved parallel to each other, similar to the lights on the wings of a plane.  After two or three seconds, the lights moved closer together as if the object was rotating.  It seemed the lights were only visible from one side. We did not see it suddenly take off.  It simply vanished after rotating. Comparing to the size of the plane we observed earlier, this object was much bigger.  We estimated it to be approximately one to two miles away, and fairly low.;30.2078230769231;-93.4043769230768
