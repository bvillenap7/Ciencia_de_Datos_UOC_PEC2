I watched it for a bit and it shot straight up, almost out of sight. I could still see the orange pulsating light, so I continued to watch it. It came back down and hovered. Then 4 lights came on and then a whole ring of lights revealing the shape of the object. Then, continuing to pulsate, like a nuclear reacter, the whole thing lit up bright orange. The dome top seemed translucent. The object we saw, was approx. 1/2 mile away and was incredibly huge. It hovered for a bit an slowly went below the treeline. I called the sheriffs dept., who in turn called Ft. Polk to see if any military exercises were going on. Ft. Polk had no comment. Shortly after I witnessed two planes flying a grid pattern. Numerous flashes of light were seen on the ground for airial photography. Also two helecopters on silent mode were searching the area for something. I waited till 1 am to see if it ever came back up. It didnt. It would easily have contained my house inside it. A camera was the farthest thing from both of our minds but believe me we have one ready to go now should the object return. It may have been friday night but I drink nothing stronger than Pepsi, nor does my wife drink. We do not do drugs. I am 50 yrs old, she is 68. We just live our lives quietly and never dreamed of seeing what we saw.;31.2177;-93.3833
