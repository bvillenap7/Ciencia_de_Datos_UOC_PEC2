I was watching the family tv, which is between two windows, then our three dogs started barking which isn't unusual.  But then string of pulsing lights caught my attention outside one of the windows.  I saw a line of lights with a brighter light pulsing down the line, left to right.  The lights were almost positively attached to one object.  It was probably 100ft away and lower than most planes that fly over the area when I first saw it.  I got up to go look and when I was walking to the window, my mom came in.  By the time she got to the window to look it had flown over the horizon, very quickly, then just hovered.  She could see the faint pulsing light, I asked her if she knew what it was, she said maybe a stationary light? I told her no, because I saw it fly over.  We watched if for a minute, stationary over the horizon, then slowly sink below the tree line.  It seemed familiar, I was just trying to make sense of it the whole time, but neither of us have been able! to.;32.6988;-92.6797
