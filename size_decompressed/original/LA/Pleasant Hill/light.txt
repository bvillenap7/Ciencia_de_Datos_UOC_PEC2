At first I thought it was an airplane but noticed it had no flashing lights like an airplane.  I also noticed it was moving to fast to be an airplane.  I pointed out to my friend and my wife we continued to watch it move across the sky hen after a few seconds it disappeared.   We saw 2 more pas by on the same path each on was about 3-5 mins apart.   Was very strange.  The lights appeared to be traveling south.;31.8104;-93.5114
