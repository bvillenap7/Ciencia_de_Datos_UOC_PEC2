Object with 2 red lights & 4 smaller strobing white lights heading west on I-12;2009-08-01 03:00:00;2.5 mins;Object with 2 red lights & 4 smaller strobing white lights heading west on I-12 I was heading west on I-12 and had just driven past the Slidell Airport Rd./Northshore Blvd. exit (about 3AM) when I noticed a red light in the sky off to my south which was also heading west (this object wasn't heading to or from the small municipal airport in Slidell).   As I continued driving and watching this object it did seem to be relatively low in the sky (3,000 to 4,000 feet up) and I could begin to make out 2 mid sized red flashing lights (each light was flashing separate of one another fairly quickly).   At this point the object slightly changed direction to begin heading Northwest.   As the object was picking up speed it seemed to be about 1/2 mile in front of me as it crossed over I-12 at the Lacombe/St. Tammany exit which is about 3 to 4 miles from the original exit that I first saw it at.  At this time I could clearly see that inbetween the 2 midsized red lights were at least 4 white strobing lights smaller than those red lights but I still could! n't see a shape to the object.  Almost underneath where the object was there were 4 vehicles traveling west, I was roughly 3 to 4 blocks in back of these vehicles. I noticed as this object passed over those vehicles, 2 of them did press on their brakes for a few seconds so I do not know if those people were able to make out the object. This area has very tall pine trees on both sides of the Interstate.  As it crossed over I-12 and continued heading on a Northwest trajectory at the same altitude I lost sight of it behind the tall pine trees on my northern side.  This entire sighting lasted just about 2.5 to 3 minutes. Now, this could have been a plane.  I simply could not make out a shape to it at all, nor did I hear any noise from it.  I live 20 miles west of this area and I live in the direct flight paths to both the International and Municipal New Orleans airports and I have never witnessed a plane with lights flashing the way these did.  I know that this wouldn't have been a commercial large plane flying that low in this area as it wasn't coming from or going towards the Armstrong International area.  I have seen smaller planes at night with just a red light on it but none that quite flashed the way these did.  I am interested in seeing if anyone else reports seeing these lights and could clear up if it was a plane or not.;30.2932691670293;-89.8113897514193
