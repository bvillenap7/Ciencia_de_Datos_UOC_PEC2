Mass amount of re objects caught on video in Slidell La.;2013-04-06 23:00:00;30 minutes;Mass amount of re objects caught on video in Slidell La. The objects were round. The color was red sort of like fire embers.  Also in my video at 1:21 you can see what appears to be an orb floating between and around two of the objects.  I witnessed these objects at the La Quinta Inn in Slidell. La.  I was in Slidell for work purposes.  There were two other persons who witnessed these objects as well.  One was a man also staying there for work purposes.  The other was a female hotel clerk. Upon talking to her about these objects I was informed that a UFO hunter group was in town a month prior for same objects. except those objects were white lights.  I never called anyone but asked repeatedly in video for someone to call.  I do not live there and I know there is a naval Air Force base not far from where I was at I just assumed maybe military stuff going on.;30.2932691670293;-89.8113897514193
Bright flashing object, multicolored flames.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2017-11-27 22:39:00;1.5 hours;Bright flashing object, multicolored flames. Last night, on November 27, 2017, I noticed a bright flashing object in the sky.  It appeared to be a star that was pulsating rapidly.  I was standing outside of my garage working on my motorcycle.  This was around 1030 in the evening.   So, I went in the house and grabbed my father, ((father's name deleted)).  I said you have to come out and see this.  We both walked out and said that’s really odd.  It looks like a star, but I’ve never seen a star flash so early Brightly. So I used my Star Walk app on my iPhone to see if I can figure out what it was.  It didn’t show anything in particular.  At least it didn’t show in that area of the sky.  It was located south east at about 120°.   So I went in and grabbed my telescope in my Canon T3 I.  I hooked up my camera to my telescope pinpointed it and took rapid succession of photos.  When I zoomed in on it and used the LCD screen of my camera, you could see the flashing of colored lights.  They were like flames all around it.  They were streaking out from around it.   I tried to take video through my camera, but for some reason, when I went to take the photos and video of the card, the video was not there.  It could’ve possibly been operator error, but I am a videographer,;30.2932691670293;-89.8113897514193
