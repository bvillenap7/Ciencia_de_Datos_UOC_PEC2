Amoeba like plasma craft.;2002-03-16 14:00:00;10 Seconds;Amoeba like plasma craft. I was in my backyard at 2pm practicing a technique known as Cloud Busting. As I was concenrating on a small cloud an object suddenly shot out of it traveling on a northern heading. The craft or thing was roughly teardrop shape. It made no noise,(aircraft I have view from this apparent distance can usually be heard,). The craft had a steady speed and I estimate it's speed, (from my experience is Close Air Support practice while serving in the Marine elite ANGLICO unit), to be in the vicinity of 800 to 1200 miles an hour. It moved much faster than any airliner I have ever seen from that distance. The object itself was translucent and had a pinkish center and ruby outer skin. It also had greyish black spots inside it's skin that seemed to move as it flew. The object left a light contrail that was smooth and even. The contrail quickly disipated behind the craft. I followed the object with my eye until it reach a larger group of clouds. As it approached the larger group of clouds the crispness of it's edges began to break up in my vision and soon I lost sight of it completely. I had the sense that this was something organic and alive. I can speculate that this was some sort of plasma creature that traditional science hasn't discovered.;30.2932691670293;-89.8113897514193
