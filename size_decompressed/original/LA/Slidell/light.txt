Confirmed 9 orange separate lights.;2013-12-24 23:20:00;25 minutes;Confirmed 9 orange separate lights. Starting at approx 23:20 noticed orange light moving out side moving North East to South West.  The third light prompted me to go outside with my father, at approx time of 23:30 .  Clearly observed multiple (counted nine) very small (estimated beach ball sized) orange lights clearly separate.  Low flying not making any noise.  It should also be noted that the night and location of observance was extremely quiet.  Took video of two flying together.  Noted also that no wind was present at ground level and sky was super clear visibility.  Also note that I was super excited having never experienced anything like this and was very talkative during video.  Father also shot video.  Mine came out better using a Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone.  Side note, lights appeared to have small red top and were constant not flashing, estimated 40-50 MPH.;30.2932691670293;-89.8113897514193
