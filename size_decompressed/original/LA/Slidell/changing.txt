Shape shifting, color changing UFO;1982-09-20 12:00:00;20 min;Shape shifting, color changing UFO The craft flew much faster than a jet would, and could hover gracefully, and quietly.  My description will follow a brief short story. A friend and I were playing ball in a school field.  He got my attention by pointing in the sky at this craft. We immediately knew it wasn’t a plan, jet, or helicopter.  We ran home, about 80 yards distance, and told my mother that something strange was in the air above the house.  She indulged us by going outside to see.  She is a religious person and wasn’t ready to accept this however had no choice but to believe what she was seeing. We quickly went to the neighbor’s house to verify with them what we were seeing.  The neighbor swiftly said, I will not talk to any reporters about this.  By this time 5-7 minutes have passed and the craft is now hovering approximately 300-500 ft. above us. It is in one almost football looking shape and colored bright silver like.  It is hovering and all the sudden splits into three parts and begins to change brilliant colors and maneuvers as if it was showing off its talent.  Incredible color change like I’ve never seen and hard to describe.  It put itself back together and hovered about 3-5 more minutes, then in the blink of an eye shot off in the sky and then it was gone.   An unforgettable sight!

Morphing Chromatic Craft with Chaser;2004-04-11 14:30:00;5 minutes;Morphing Chromatic Craft with Chaser In the sky above our house on a clear day I spotted an object that was bright with chrome reflection. The object seemed to be about anywhere from 2000 to 5000 feet high. There where no clouds in the sky to guage height. There were no other aircraft in the sky to guage scale. My wife noticed it as well, and she agreed to keep an eye on it as I ran in the house and got my camera. I shot several images of the craft. In the max zoom of my telephoto lens (70 to 210) the object appeared to be a series of chrome spheres that seemed to be constantly moving and changing shape. Several times the objects formed a verticle V shape. The V shape was made twice in a very short time of say 3 seconds. I have photos of this, (as negatives as I haven't developed the images yet.) The group of orbs totaled 7 objects in all. They approached our house from the west and then began to travel south once they where over our house. Soon another sigular orb apeared from the north and started to follow the grouped orbs south. The group of orbs picked up speed slightly, and were soon covered from view by trees. Sight was lost on the sigular orb after the group moved south. The group continued to change shape the entire sighting.  I reported this with the understanding that I may be reporting a few Mylar baloons that got loose from somewhere. I have access to Mylar baloons at the car lot I work at but, I have never seen them behave in the manner I have described.  I will update this story after I have the photos developed.  I have included an illustration for reference.;30.2932691670293;-89.8113897514193
