Strange objects in night sky which appear to be distant stars.;2014-04-27 01:50:00;2 hours;Strange objects in night sky which appear to be distant stars. My son and I was camping while lying on our backs looking at stars through binoculars, we were looking at stars which we could not see with naked eye, just roaming until we see some stars which were very far away, just enjoying the night.  I looked at a star, with binoculars, which was rather bright, but appeared to have structure around it.   I then looked at it with a small med powered telescope and it appeared to be some sort of craft.   There was another one (star) I also observed. which appeared to be larger then the first, like some type of space station.  It blew my mind.   I am a retired police officer and I have been a sky watcher since I was 7  years old.  This was not a star by no means.  What is it?   When I was 7 I saw a UFO pass through New Orleans.  If I remember, it was Oct. 11, 1973.   Just found your site and had to share this sighting.  Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
