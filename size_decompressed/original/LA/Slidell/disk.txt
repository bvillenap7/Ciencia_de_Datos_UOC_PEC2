As we made out way down her street, we witnessed an obvious UFO above and in front of my truck just above the tree line. It should be noted that her street is near a major shopping center, but her street is secluded with trees and wooded area surrounding the road.  There are street lights along the road but quite spaced out and are often out/dim. There was a car approximately 500 yards behind me traveling the same direction.  As we approached her driveway, which is on the left, we both observed a UFO with white lights blinking around the rim of the object.  They blinked on and off rotating around similar to the light movement of the arcade game that you have to hit the stop button as it passes the 10 in front of your spot. The lights were very visible and the craft was just above the trees and about 20 yards in front of us.  The object was moving right to left passing over the road/trees.  As it went over the street we arrived to her driveway which we quickly jumped out to attempt a second sighting of it, however it was gone. She does live within about 10 miles from a small airport, however the craft did not have any green or red lights the the circling white pattern.  It should be noted that we couldn't see the full outline of the object due to the trees and darkness, however we could clearly see the edge shape due to the lights circling it.  I would estimate the size of the object to be approximately 75 to 200 feet wide. My girlfriend is afraid of the idea so she automatically said it was a plane, however there was a plane flying high up in the sky that was clearly a plane with the red, green, and white light. She accepted the fact that we saw what we saw, a UFO.  It should also be noted that for as low as it was there should have been a distinct sound, especially if it were a plane, however we heard none.  My truck is not the quietest in the world especially since I also had the radio on, however there should've been a distinct sound for as low as it was. This was the first time I had ever experienced seeing something of this nature, but I am so glad that I have my own proof enabling me to personally know without question that they are out there.  There is however always the chance it could've been a military craft, but it was definitely not a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
