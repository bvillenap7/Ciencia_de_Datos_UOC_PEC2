She was driving home by herself with our daughter from my house. She turned on to military road drove for half a mile and saw these lights in the sky. She just told me about it yesterday and she does not believe in aliens or anything like that.  She said it was the wierdest thing she has ever seen in her life and she almost stopped her car in the middle of the road to watch it.  Last nigt I showed her video of the ufos taped in Mexico last month and she said the light looked similar buy in a diff shape I will try and illustrate. The Mexico lights when there was six in the frame looked like this - - -  - - - She said their was also six light but they looked like this . Ok my description is not coming out right.

Red lighted solid object.;2011-10-16 20:45:00;1 minute;Red lighted solid object. 10/16/2011 Slidell, LA. I wasn't planning to report this until I read the recent sightings in Georgia and Florida of green and red lights. I walked outside around 8:45pm to smoke a cigarette. I looked up at the stars like I always do at night when I go out to smoke. While scanning the sky I noticed a bright red object moving at a steady pace. This object seemed to be swaying a little bit as I observed it.  It appeared to be at a very high altitude that of a jet liner (30,000 feet or more). I couldn't hear anything( but I live near the Interstate and its quite noisy).  The light was constant with no strobe and appeared bright but very high in the sky. I watched it for about a minute moving from West to East before I could no longer see it.  It may have turned slightly to the south before it disappeared in the night sky.  I have seen many helicopters and planes flying at night but this was different.  This light seemed as if it was fire. I wanted to post this to encourage others who may have had a closer look a this object. I really want to know what it was I saw!;30.2932691670293;-89.8113897514193
