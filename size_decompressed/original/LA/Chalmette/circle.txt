ROUND BLACK DISC HOVERING OVER CHALMETTE, LA;2010-10-29 01:15:00;15 SECONDS;ROUND BLACK DISC HOVERING OVER CHALMETTE, LA ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER 29, 2010, ABOUT 115 AM AFTER MIDNIGHT, I OBSERVED, WITH MY TELESCOPE THE MOON.  THE MOON WAS FULL THAT NIGHT.  AS I WAS LOOKING THRU THE TELESCOPE AT THE MOON, ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS A BLACK DISC SHAPED OBJECT.  IT MOVED ACROSS THE LENS OF MY TELESCOPE.  IT PASSED IN FRONT OF THE MOON, AS I WAS OBSERVING THIS EVENT.   THE LENS OF MY TELESCOPE IS 3 INCHES IN DIAMETER, SO THE MOON ALMOST COVERS THE LENS OF MY TELESCOPE.  THE OBJECT THAT PASSED BETWEEN THE LENS OF MY TELESCOPE, IT WAS ALMOST 1/3 THE SIZE OF THE MOON.  AS I WATCHED IT PASS SLOWLY, IT ALMOST BLOCKED THE VIEW OF THE MOON AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE FACE OF THE MOON SIDEWAYS.   I OBSERVED THIS DARK DISC FOR ABOUT ABOUT 15 SECONDS AS IT MOVED FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.  WHAT I BELIEVE THAT I SAW WAS SOMETHING VERY STRANGE AND ODD.  AFTER  I OBSERVED THIS STRANGE OBJECT, I WAS PUZZLED AS TO WHAT IT WAS THAT I HAD SEEN. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded quite convincing.
