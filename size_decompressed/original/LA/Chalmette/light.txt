9 small star like objects moving at different times across night sky.;2011-06-15 20:50:00;50 minutes;9 small star like objects moving at different times across night sky. On Wednesday June 15, 2011, at approximately 8:38 PM central time, the ISS flew over from the WSW to NE.   About 8:50 PM a small star like object was spotted moving from the NE toward the S.  The object was about as bright as a star though not as bright as one from a constellation.  This was the first of nine similar objects. The second and third objects appeared around 9:00 PM.  One was headed N to S and the other S to N. moving away from each other.  The fourth and fifth objects were seen around 9:15.  One was moving SSE and the other was moving from W to E and the two objects intersected.  The remainders of the objects were seen every few minutes until about 9:40 PM. I checked the Heavens-Above website for satellites that may have been overhead but I didnâ€™t see any listing for my area at that time.  Hopefully that is all they were.;29.9498769230769;-89.9618173076923
