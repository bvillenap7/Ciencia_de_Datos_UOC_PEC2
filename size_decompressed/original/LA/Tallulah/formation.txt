Night time sighting.  Two reddish/brown discs passed directly overhead at amazingly low altitude.;2010-11-26 21:30:00;12-15 seconds;Night time sighting.  Two reddish/brown discs passed directly overhead at amazingly low altitude. The discs (2) were traveling from north to due south, one directly in-line behind the other.  Estimate distance between them to be approximately 30 feet. Both were moving at approximately 80 to 90 knots (I was recently a pilot-in- training, and held a classified job in the DoN as a Government Contractor working high level security for the U.S. Navy/Marine Corps).  I estimate the disks to be at approximately 600 feet in elevation above ground level, and approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter.  Could clearly see lines in the skin of the discs.  Each was dark reddish-brown in color, possibly black. The lines appeared to be panels of some sort.  The bright orange halide lights from the Elementary School's parking lot (across the street) were clearly reflecting off the underside of the discs.  They produced no internal or external lighting.  Estimate craft to be approximately 30 to 40 feet in diameter.  They were totally silent as they passed directly over me that evening.  The sky was clear, there was no discernable wind, and no moon was present at time of the sighting.  The whole siting lasted approximately 12 to 15 seconds. (Note: this was about the same time as the Minden, Louisiana, UFO crash which occurred approximately 70 miles to the north-northeast of Tallulah, Louisiana). This was but one of many UFO/anomalous activities that I have come to witness over the past 10 years.  Several with witnesses... whom wish to remain anon- ymous.  Follow-on reports to be filed, when time permits. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));32.4367;-91.0617
