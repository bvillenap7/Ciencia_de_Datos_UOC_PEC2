white ball traveling at high speed over Springhill, Louisiana;2008-01-15 07:47:00;2 minutes;white ball traveling at high speed over Springhill, Louisiana My 6-year-old son and I were driving from Springhill, Louisiana, to Shongaloo, Louisiana, and were noticing that there were several lines in the sky where aircrafts had flown through the clouds.  We were counting them (we counted eight of them) when my son said, Look at that airplane!  To my left up in the sky there was what looked like a white ball traveling at an alarming speed.  There also appeared to be either a flashing white light on this object.  I watched it for about 20 seconds, then it disappeared behind a cloud, came back out the other side, and I watched it for at least another minute.  Even my 6-year-old said, Mommy, that doesn't look like an airplane.  At approximately 8:05 AM, almost 20 minutes after we spotted this object, we heard a news report on the radio that some people in Texas had seen what they thought was a UFO, but that federal officials are reporting that it was an aircraft in the sun.;33.001;-93.4597
