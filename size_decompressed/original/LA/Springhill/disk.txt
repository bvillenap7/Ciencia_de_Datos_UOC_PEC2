My wife at the time was proceeding north on Hwy 371, 2 miles south of Springhill, Louisiana, with our 2 kids.  A saucer shaped object was seen to her left, approximately 75 to 100 feet in the air, moving north at a slow rate of speed, with lights around the bottom, and tilted to expose the bottom of the object as she drove by the area on her left.   Said area was the major construction site of International Paper Company's future Wood products and Plywood manufacturing plants which at the time was only the huge concrete pads for the facilities.  The object moved north and parallel to Hwy 371 approximately 3/4 of a mile at a slow rate of speed as she proceeded north on 371 at about 40 mph.  When the object reached the northern most point of the construction it stopped its northern motion and shot away in a south westerly direction at a high rate of speed.
