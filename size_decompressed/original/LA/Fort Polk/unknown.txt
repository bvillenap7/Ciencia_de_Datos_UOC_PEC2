I was awaiting what was called the cattle trucks to transport our company back to the barrackes.  I was looking up at the stars as I was standing there and observed what I thought was skylab.  A light came across the sky and as it was directly overhead it came to a complete stop.   It sat there for was seemed like a full minute and then it shot directly up and out of sight in a blink of the eye.   It was many years after the experience before I ever spoke of the event.  I truly beleive that what I saw was a UFO observing a military installation and am unaware if any of the people that were with me saw the object. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));31.0466;-93.2054
