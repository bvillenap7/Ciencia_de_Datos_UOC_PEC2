Fireball racing to earth.;2011-02-17 10:15:00;4 seconds;Fireball racing to earth. It was 10pm-10.45, sitting on my patio.  I saw what looked like a motor shell(comet) racing to earth. It had a tail about 2 ft. I was a good football field and a half away from this.  It came straight down ,slight angle. made little noise, but appear it was gonna hit land.  There are trees there that look to be 80ft or taller.  This thing, the tail got shorter, looked like the middle was circular, I could see it was burning out.  And then it flared out and disappeared.  It vanished at about one-half the height, higher than the trees.  I believe something is in the field.  This thing came close to landing on my apartment.  There was a solar flare like the day before, and I heard satelites were knocked from their orbits.  Could it be a piece of a satelite?  All I know, it feels like a once in a lifetime event.;29.5883388535032;-90.727249044586
