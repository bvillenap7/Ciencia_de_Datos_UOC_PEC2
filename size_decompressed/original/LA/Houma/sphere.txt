I saw an orange-red colored sphere in the sky.  It resembled the flickering of a candle.  It was not a plane or helicopter.  If I had to guess it looked like it was a couple hundred feet in the air by judging how fast we were driving.  I didnt see an object, it was only light.  It moved back and forth in many directions.  It was completely silent.   I have watched the skies for years and have never seen anything like this before.  We watched it for about 3 minutes.   I pulled over and then it made a fading pulse for about 2 seconds and then completely disappeared.;29.5883388535032;-90.727249044586
