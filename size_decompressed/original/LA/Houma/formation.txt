Numerous red lights in sky over Houma.;2014-09-13 20:30:00;15 minutes;Numerous red lights in sky over Houma. I noticed 4 of these red lights in the sky while driving. When I looked to my left there were around 7 to 8 more.  They were moving from East to West.  They were strung out over a large area, and seemed to be pretty low in altitude.  Some looked like they were hovering, but some were clearly moving in a stop and go characteristic.  Pretty fast too.  They weren't flying in any specific formation, just spread out all over.;29.5883388535032;-90.727249044586
