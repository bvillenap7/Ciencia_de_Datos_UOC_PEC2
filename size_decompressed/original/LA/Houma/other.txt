Very flat vehicle with flashing, white lights on the side.;2013-02-03 17:00:00;<1 minute;Very flat vehicle with flashing, white lights on the side. I drove onto Savanne Road, inside Houma, Louisiana on Saturday, February 3rd at approximately 5 o' clock, seventeen hundred hours, headed toward Martin Luther King Blvd.   While driving, I was on speaker phone, along with someone in the back seat, and passenger seat.  I was the only person to see the object, as I voiced it as I saw it fly south, as I was driving east (used google maps to see which direction we were facing.)  It zipped fast through the sky as I noticed it. Something alerted me to look ahead.  I was traveling fast, but slow enough for me to see it.  It was a very flat shaped object with bright, flashing lights located on the side of the vehicle.  The flashes were what I noticed, and it got my attention.  I think I saw a red, or pinkish light in some place too.  The area surrounding Savanne Road is nothing but swamp area.  I even saw on Google Maps that the direction the vehicle flew would be swamps for a good, long time, and distance.  The vehicle seems to be the same type as seen with the Chinese airport ufo that shut it down for days, and the saint louis cathedral ufo inside new orleans, la.  It was skinny the same way, slick, and had lights on the side.;29.5883388535032;-90.727249044586
