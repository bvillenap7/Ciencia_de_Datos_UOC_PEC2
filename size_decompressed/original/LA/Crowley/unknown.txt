Machine Sounding Heart Beat;1979-09-01 02:00:00;1  minute;Machine Sounding Heart Beat   I was sleeping after working night and woke to find no one home. I looked over to the left of the room after seeing something move. There was a very small person, no different then pics we see of so called Aliens today. This little guy move across my room and went into the living room. I jumped out of bed to see where he was going. He vanished.. About 3 months later I was living at my sisters house. I woke on night,there was a sound of a huge heart beat,very loud, but machine like. I could not move, not even open my eyes. I than could fill myself moving, but I couldn't fill anything below me. I think I was just floating, I then found myself outside of my bedroom, I could fill the cold air now, smell the pine tree next to my room. I was scared to death. I have told my children of this, they always laughed at me. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));30.2152;-92.3787
