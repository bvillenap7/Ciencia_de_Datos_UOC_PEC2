A dozen bright strars appeared in a straight line over Crowley, La. this morning.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 05:50:00;10 minutes;A dozen bright strars appeared in a straight line over Crowley, La. this morning I witnessed a group of 12 stars, in a straight line, in the southeastern sky of Crowley, Louisiana at 5:50am, on January 7, 2020.  An airplane was flying east to west across the line of stars. They were not moving. They slowly faded away. I'm 66 years old an a fan of the space program as I have seem everything from Sputnik till today, I am somewhat knowledgeable of astronomy, and have never seen anything like it as an eyewitness or in any form of media. They were larger than the space station appears, they last for about 10 minutes, then faded away. If they were satellites, someone would have had to align them perfectly. They were as big or bigger than the biggest star or planet in the sky. Have pics.;30.2152;-92.3787
