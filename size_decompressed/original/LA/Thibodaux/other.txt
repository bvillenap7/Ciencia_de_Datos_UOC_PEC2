Eyewitness of a large, silent,  bluish-white object traveling over Thibodaux from east to west.;1995-09-23 23:00:00;1 minute;Eyewitness of a large, silent,  bluish-white object traveling over Thibodaux from east to west. I was sitting outside of my house facing east, with the edge of the roof just above my head. I suddenly detected the movement of a dimly lit object in my periferal vision in the sky above me. The object appeared to be nearly twice the size of a full moon when it appears directly overhead. It was traveling from west to east. The object was blueish-white in color. Its body was slightly arched like the mid-section of a rainbow, with a pod-like appenditure on each side. It appeared to be composed entirely of light, as if it were a hologram. Against the backdrop of a clear night sky, it was initally just bright enough to catch my periferal vision, but as the craft advanced toward the east where the sky grew hazier, it became brighter, apparently because the water droplets were beginning to reflect the light that the object was emitting. Innitially all I could see was the underbelly of the craft, but as it proceeded to the east, I could see the back of the craft rising like a mammoth wall from the bottom to the top. The object was three-dimentional and sharply defined. It maintained its size, shape, and speed throughout, with only a slight ajustment in course from slightly south of due-east to due-east. I watched the object proceed eastward, where it disappeared in the midst of a cloud. The object made no sound whatsoever.;29.7978000000002;-90.8096999999997
I spotted two unidentifiable objects hovering stationary in the sky.  I estimated them to be around 4-5' k.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-24 05:00:00;1 hour;In the early hours of the morning, I spotted two unidentifiable objects hovering stationary in the sky.  I estimated them to be around 4 to 5000ft above the ground.   The objects could be described as orange splinters that glowed and faded in and out of sight over the course of an hour.  At their brightest they appeared to be flickering as if on fire.   I know these not to be regular aircrafts as I work in aviation and are familiar with the nature of modern aircraft.
