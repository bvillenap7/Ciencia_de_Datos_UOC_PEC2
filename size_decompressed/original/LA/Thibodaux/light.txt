It was a solid light, more like a planet, then we realized it was moving in an easterly direction.  It did not blink and made no sound.  It moved at a steady pace, much faster than a jet or airplane, then suddenly and quickly flew out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of ISS.  PD));29.7978000000002;-90.8096999999997

I watched it for about 5 seconds and it suddenly disappeared.  The sky was clear.  I have a couple sites saved and checked to see if maybe it was the Hubble or ISS.  Well I was shocked when I saw it was neither.  It moved down on the horizon about the same speed as the ISS would.  I have never seen anything like this before.

Once they turned you could not see the red light on the front.  There were 10 of these crafts.  They were all at different altitudes but obviously traveling together.  I could not hear any sound.  They got within one mile from me before turning.  This was a dark night only a sliver of a moon.  Never seen anything like that before.;29.7978000000002;-90.8096999999997
