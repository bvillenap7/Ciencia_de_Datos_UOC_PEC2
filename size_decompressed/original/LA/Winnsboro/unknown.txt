PD));2011-08-01 23:00:00;over 2 hrs;We couldnt make out the shape but we saw red and blue flashing lights hovering for over two hours. I was in bed when my husband came in the bed room, got his rifle, and said he had just saw a UFO and it was still there.  My husband is the most level headed person I know so I jumped up to see what he was talking about...It was too far away to see a shape but I could instantly tell what he was talking about...Looking out over the road at the sky we could see these blue and red flashing lights and we could tell when it was moving because we saw a flash of white and a sudden shift in placement or elevation...We sat there for over two hours watching it, we saw two fast moving planes fly around it but never right at it or near it...I finally went to bed at 01:00 and he was still out there.
