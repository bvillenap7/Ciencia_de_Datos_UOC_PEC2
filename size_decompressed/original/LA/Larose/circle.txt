Red Ball of light seen hovering over Lake Salvador in Louisiana.;2006-02-15 22:00:00;30 minutes;Red Ball of light seen hovering over Lake Salvador in Louisiana. On the above date and time myself and a coworker were working on the water near Lake Salvador in Lafourch Parish. At this time we saw a Red Ball of light move slowly from West to East and come to a stop and hover over the lake for approximately 20 minutes. The craft then moved upward into the cloud deck and disappeared. I hold a private pilots license and I spent some time in the military and I have never seen anything like this before. The object made no sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));29.5729;-90.3833
