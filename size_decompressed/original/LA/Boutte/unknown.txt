A slow moving object with rotating lights in the early morning sky, 10 miles southwest of New Orleans.;2009-02-01 03:00:00;10 minutes;A slow moving object with rotating lights in the early morning sky, 10 miles southwest of New Orleans. On the morning of February 1, 2009, at approximately 0300hrs, the reporting officer observed an object in the sky at a 45 degree angle above the horizon.  At arms length the object was 3 inches wide as seen between index finger and thumb.  The object is estimated to have been 1/4 of a mile away from the reporting officer's location at the beginning of sighting.  The object was moving in a southerly direction at a very slow rate of speed.  The object stopped and was stationary for close to 2 and one half minutes before it continued to move on.  The object had on one side a rotating blue light, the other side had a rotating white and yellow light.  The center of the object had a larger red light that rolled in an vertical manner, not a rotating horizontal manner as the other lights.  The reporting officer was outside and no sound was heard.  No shape was noticed, though the lights were appearing to be on opposite ends on each other, with the center light centered between them and slightly lower.  The event lasted 9min 30 seconds to 10min.  I am a deputy sheriff in the same parish as the sighting.;29.901;-90.3936
