Black boomerang wing with no sound or lights passes low and fast over south Louisiana;2003-08-13 19:25:00;8sec;Black boomerang wing with no sound or lights passes low and fast over south Louisiana Just after little league football practice it had just got dark,but still a little light.We had a coaches meeting and I looked up to see the jet that I could here,and that is when I saw a shadowy black boomerang shape.It was just like a long wing with no fuselage! It was very low as I caught site of it right over us.Right away it was strange because it was too far out ahead of the sound.I looked to the sound and I found the jet I was hearing it was very high .The black wing did not make a sound,have lights,or a con trail.This all happend so fast that when I looked back the wing was just out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate, even though it was submitted the day after the alleged sighting.  We will ask the witness why this is the case.
