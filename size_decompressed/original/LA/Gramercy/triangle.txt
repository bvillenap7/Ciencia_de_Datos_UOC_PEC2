IT HAD SEVEN BRIGHT LIGHTS ARRANGED IN A TRIANGLE  OF THREE FORWARD AND FOUR IN A CLOSE SQUARE BEHIND. I WAS DRIVING ON HWY 61 BETWEEN GRAMERCY  AND SORRENTO LA., I SAW BRIGHT LIGHTS OFF TO MY LEFT AT ABOUT 40 DEGREES FROM THE HORIZON. IT APPEARED TO BE STATIONARY. AS I DROVE ON I REALISED THAT IT WAS MOVING SLOWLY  ACROSS MY PATH. WE MOVED TOGETHER UNTIL THE OBJECT WAS ALMOST DIRECTLY ABOVE ME. AT THIS POINT A SHAPE BECAME APPARENT, IT WAS CLEARLY ONE OBJECT IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE. I SAW ONLY THE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS, THERE WERE NO FLASHING LIGHTS AT ALL.                          I AM A PHOTOGRAPHER WITH MANY YEARS EXPERIENCE. THE LIGHTS APPEARED TO ME TO BE A WARM WHITE, MAYBE ON THE ORDER OF 20 TO 28K KELVIN.;30.0565;-90.6898
