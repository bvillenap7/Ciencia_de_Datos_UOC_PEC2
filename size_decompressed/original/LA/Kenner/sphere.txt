Clear sphere seen;2004-04-15 17:15:00;10 sec.;Clear sphere seen I live near an airport and was on my way home from work. I was watching an airliner taking off while exiting the interstate. I noticed something shining well above the jet. I saw a small sphere that seemed to be invisible, but it was reflecting sunlight and you could see the outline. Kind of like the camouflage on the Predator movies. I saw it for about 10 seconds. I then looked down to see where the traffic was. When I looked back up, I couldn't find it again.;30.02156;-90.2520299999999
