I was driving West on Airline Highway going towards Williams And I saw an object flying Towards traffic , coming towards my direction.  I slowed down enough to observe it.  It didnâ€™t look like any plane that I was seeing in the distance and it was going an opposite direction of any other aircraft.  It was triangle with 2 white lights close together and a blue light on one side and a red light on the other.   The craft seemed to be hovering, yet moving forward at a steady speed.  When I turned around it was gone.  I was going to try to take a picture, but it was too late.  No smoke trails or sound .;30.02156;-90.2520299999999
