Strange light;2004-08-14 01:07:00;one second;Strange light At 1:07am walking from my back yard shed going inside, I was spooked as the dark ground suddenly flashed. As I looked up I saw nothing, my first guess was lightning, but its clear skys, no planes in the air, just the outline of a tree that I realized from the shadow on the groud that the flash had to come almost directly above me. It was only one flash, it happend so quick I looked straight up and there was nothing their. I ask my self if I'm tripping, the ground was light up by a light with the intensity for my to see the grass as clear as I did, I'm convinced I'm not, I was not lightnig but with the same effect.;30.02156;-90.2520299999999
Three lights travelling in a clockwise pattern behind my home.;2009-01-23 23:30:00;15-20 min;Three lights travelling in a clockwise pattern behind my home. On the 23 of January, 2009 at approximately 2330 hours while in the rear of my home in Kenner, Louisiana I looked out almost exactly due west of my home and saw what appeared to be two or three lights in the sky circling in a clockwise pattern over what I know to be swamp, and open water. It appeared that all the lights though holding a steady pattern were travelling at different speeds since one seemed to be overtaking the others. Occasionally one light would come slightly into the forefront before disappearing behind clouds towards what would be the west from my vantage point. One light appeared to almost change shapes as it travelled at times looking almost like a bird and at others looking only like a round or oval piece of light. I do not know what it was however, as a 5-year veteran of law enforcement in this area I know I have never seen anything like it.;30.02156;-90.2520299999999

Five motionless red lights in a roughly triangular formation sighted in north Kenner, Louisiana.;2012-07-14 21:55:00;a few minutes;Five motionless red lights in a roughly triangular formation sighted in north Kenner, Louisiana. On Saturday night, July 14, 2012, my wife and I were driving west on West Esplanade Ave. in Kenner, Louisiana and turned north northwest onto Driftwood Blvd.  Straight ahead were red lights in the sky in formation.  We turned left onto Emile Ave. and could not see the lights.  We turned right onto Osborne Ave. but the lights were hidden by trees.  I told my wife about them and we drove down Osborne and could see them to the north when we passed by houses without trees.  We turned right (due north) on Gelpi Ave. and could see five red lights in the sky in a roughly triangular formation.  They did not appear to be moving.  They seemed to be suspended and motionless in the sky. They were relatively high in the sky.  From our vantage point, I would estimate that they were between 30° to 45° up into the sky. We assumed that they were over Lake Pontchartrain.  As we continued driving north trying to find an unobscured viewing area, the lights suddenly faded and di! sappeared.  Disappointed, we turned around and headed home.  At this point, I looked at the clock on my dashboard and mentally noted that it was at exactly 10:00 PM CDT.  What was unusual about these lights is that they were above the normal flight path of planes landing or taking off from New Orleans International Airport.  We see jet lights all the time.  These were not jet lights.  I don’t know what they were.;30.02156;-90.2520299999999
Two bright flashes and some sort of movement in the same area.;2013-03-04 19:30:00;10 seconds;two bright flashes and some sort of movement in the same area I was standing in our back yard, watching as planes approached our airport from the north, when I caught a glimpse of a bright flash to my northeast approximately 50 degrees from the horizon.   When I focused on the area where the flash came from, I saw some sort of movement in that area and then another bright flash.  I continued to watch the area, but did not see anything after that.;30.02156;-90.2520299999999
Noticed bright light with what looked like several pulsating red lights.  Stayed stationary for a long time then drifted across sky.;2015-07-01 04:50:00;20 minutes;Noticed bright light with what looked like several pulsating red lights.  Stayed stationary for a long time then drifted across sky.  No noise that I could here.   I am an aviation enthusiast and amateur astronomer.  The object may have been man made, but it was very strange, so much so that I drove out to the levy to get a better look but lost sight of it and it disappeared.   It must have been very large because as I got close and closer it seemed to get larger.   I am not certain but I would say it was oval.  It appeared to be located near the Bonnie Carey Spillway in the Western sky just west of Kenner.   Hope someone else might have got a better look to report what it was.
