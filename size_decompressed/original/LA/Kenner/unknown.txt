This time it was travelling East to West directly over Lake Pontchartrain in line with Loyola Blvd. Kenner.  It was a lot farther away, and I was wondering if it was a  large bird soaring at first, but that question was resolved when it entered the clouds and slowly disappeared. It was on a trajectory that was increasing in height.....half the speed of an aircraft which is why it came to my attention.  Why I thought it was the same as the one I reported on 7-4-17 was that it was pure black against the blue sky, then against the clouds.  No shimmer of any sort. Military....perhaps, but very strange speed.   I'm an amateur astronomer, and very well familiarized with aviation. I've seen a lot of strange things over the lake, I'm beginning to wonder!;30.02156;-90.2520299999999
I saw a craft(s) with a hugh bright light in front and the light wrapped around craft like a semi circle.;2019-03-18 19:00:00;15 minutes;On March 18, 2019, approximately 7:30pm, I was travelling West on I-10 from Kenner to LaPlace.  Half way to my left, I saw a craft(s) with a hugh bright light in front and the light wrapped around craft like a semi circle.  There were no other lights.   They were 3 of them in line formation, but some distance apart from each other.  They were stopped in midair not moving.  They were hugh in size.  I rolled my window down and was no sound whatsoever of any plane or helicopter.   I wanted to take pics or video it but travelling on interstate 70mph did not want to risk accident.  That was very strange!!;30.02156;-90.2520299999999
