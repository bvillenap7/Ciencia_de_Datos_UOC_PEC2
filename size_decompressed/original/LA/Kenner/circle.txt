My mom went to work and i watched her drive away.We lived on Salem St.I was upstairs in the Duplex we lived in looking out my window.The neighbor's yellow house was my view,along with a birdhouse on a pole, the tops of the trees,and other duplexes.I noticed a red light which i looked like it was on his bird house.I thought thats odd,then i noticed it was moving.I went downstairs,out the door,and into the street,when i saw the leading edge appear from behind the trees at the end of the street.it was over Veterans Highway, it was a round craft.Metal,at least it appeared to me to be,although it was not shiny,but muted.It had a red light on top,no sound,and a yellow glow coming down on the highway.on the outer rim it had a series,of intermingling lights,that blended as they rotated around the craft.I thought they seemed liquid.almost like the way a lava lamp bubbles.Fluid and gentle.The craft was bigger than or at least as big as the neighbors house.I was watching it move slowly,over the road,when on the side a window appeared.It was'nt there before,and just appeared.I saw two beings both the now familiar Grey's.they were moving their arms as if operating controls on a panel,when the one closest to me slowly turned ,(head only),and looked directly at me.It then slowly turned to it's companion,they then both turned at the same time and looked at me.Then the window was gone!Just like that.I was not scared,just amazed.My dad was asleep on the sofa,and I was in the street Yelling for him.I got the idea to run inside and wake him,which i did,and when we got outside to the street it was gone!Fast forward to 20 yr's later at a friends house,and he was working on his friends car,when his friend and i both discovered we had seen the same craft.He stated he had seen it further up veterans hwy,over a crowded intersection,that same yr.I told my family what i'd seen,and they did not believe me.Although I'm no veteran,Military service did not suit me,i opted to get out,(Honorable),but no great car! eer move Nevertheless,i was familiar with Helicopters,and we lived near the airport.I Know what I saw.!!
