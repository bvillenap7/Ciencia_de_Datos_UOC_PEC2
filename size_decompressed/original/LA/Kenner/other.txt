I was really taken aback because it was pitch black against the blue sky. I tried to figure out if it was a drone, but I heard no noise and saw no lights.  It traveled from the south in a straight line moving NNE.  It disappeared over Lake Ponchatrain.  The distance travelled had to be at least 2 miles.  It was hard to estimate the height.  It took approx. 1 minute to travel across the sky.  I ran to get my camera, but the batteries were dead!!!  Is it possible this was a drone?   This is the oddest thing I've ever seen in the sky, and I'm an amateur astronomer. Hoping someone else might have seen it, because if you looked up around that time, there is NO WAY you could have missed it.;30.02156;-90.2520299999999
