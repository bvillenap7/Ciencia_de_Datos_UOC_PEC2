bluish white lights over the trees just outside of farmerville, louisiana;2005-12-24 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;bluish white lights over the trees just outside of farmerville, louisiana My husband and I and our two small toddlers were on our way back home driving down hwy.15 about three miles west of  farmerville, louisiana when my husband first noticed bright bluish white flashing lights in the sky about 50-100 feet in the air right above the trees off to the right side of our car.  He pointed the sphere of lights out to me.  We both noticed that the lights would blink on and off when the object would move.  It stayed about a minute in front of our car where we could see it then moved suddenly behind our car, and blinked a couple more times before it completely disappeared from view.
