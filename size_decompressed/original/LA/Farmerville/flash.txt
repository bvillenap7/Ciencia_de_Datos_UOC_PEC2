It was much like a light bulb that blows out when you turn on the switch.  It seems to me I saw a black spot in the middle.   Two weeks prior, myself and witness observed a large light drift by- much like a light house.  A side to side motion was made.   Light was too large to be any aircraft.  Did not pulsate.  It was white in color and distorted on outer edges like it was behind glass.;32.7551;-92.3182
