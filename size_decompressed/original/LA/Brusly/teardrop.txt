Orange bright light, with a different shape than any other craft I have ever seen.  It was by chance that I happened to go to the window and look out and see this, this past New Year's Eve. I couldn't sleep and was asking GOD to please help.   I then, immediately went to my window to look out, not even knowing why, but as soon as I did, I saw the UFO. I yelled at my husband and he finally came running out, and he thought he wasn't alone in the room, but he was.  He saw the light/craft too.   Also, in the air that night were fireworks, and a spotlight, but nothing quite like this.  I couldn't tell you how big or anything it was, cause not sure exactly how high it was.  It was non-comparable to any aircraft and must have been enormous.  I will never forget it.  Could not get a picture, cause didn't want to miss this phenomenal event.  My husband was also a witness.  Also, the moon after seeing this UFO disappear, was so bright white, like none other and very low and! sitting in my backyard almost, just like the craft was above my yard!   A few days later, we saw a video on YouTube.com of the same night, and craft we witnessed.  So apparently, we were not the only ones. My dad has also witnessed UFO's years ago, at least 2 in his lifetime. Thank you so much for this website.;30.3905;-91.254
