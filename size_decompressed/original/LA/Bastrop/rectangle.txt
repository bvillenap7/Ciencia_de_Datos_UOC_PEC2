Large rectangular object, about 100 yards over the power lines.;1978-08-21 19:00:00;10min;Large rectangular object, about 100 yards over the power lines. A friend and I saw this huge metallic rectangular object near dusk over an apartment complex.  The object was roughly about 150 feet long, and 40 feet high, with a light shining in the left front corner.  We watched this object for about 10 minutes, it made no sound.  It then slowly moved east ascending in a spiral before it shot straight up faster than anything i've ever seen and dissapeared.  We have never reported this experience and would like to find others from the area that may have seen this object in this time frame.;32.7921;-91.91
