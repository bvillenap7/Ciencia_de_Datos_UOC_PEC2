4 green spheres over a lake;2011-09-20 02:00:00;1;4 green spheres over a lake I am a sergeant for the above Parish. I observed 4 green spheres(probably 20 feet in diameter) hovering over Bussy Break.  My unit went dead. My radio did not work.I observed the 4 spheres go up into the clouds and observed a flash of what appeared to be lightning and then they were gone.  Then my unit came back on except I had to start the engine again.  I told nobody of this. I thought this lasted for maybe 5 minutes.I found out that headquaters had been radioing me for 2 hours and were in the process of looking for me.  I advised them that I made a mistake and put a weak battery in my radio and it went dead.  I was not about to tell them what I saw.  I am a supervisor for crying out loud.  I don't know if theis was the exact date in September but I am sure of the time.;32.7921;-91.91

It literally followed us home about 3 miles then stopped and hovered on the opposite side of the road  when we pulled into our driveway. I videoed the object hovering about 75 yards away just over the tops of the trees on the other side of the road for about 20 minutes. During this time, my new car stalled briefly and me and my son both saw a very tall, about 9-10 feet tall, black figure standing on the opposite side of the yard, about 50 yards away. We both jumped out of my car and ran into the house and locked the door.  As I looked out the window in the door, I saw the sphere take off upwards at a superfast rate of speed.  A few months later I videoed another craft exactly the same up in Cheyenne , WY hovering about 100 yards away from my house just above the trees .;32.7921;-91.91
