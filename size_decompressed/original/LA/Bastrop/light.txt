due south of bastrop;1996-12-29 20:00:00;1 hour;SUMMARY:  due south of bastrop A bright light was seen in the sky, and was thought to be a star until it started moving.  It moved back and forth, and up and down.  Sometimes it climbed in a diagonal course. The object also changed colors.  It went from blue to redto green.  Later, WE briefly saw the same object again, but in a different part of sky.  I often look for such objects, but I've never seen anything quiet like this.;32.7921;-91.91
White/Orange Light Ball in sky at night over louisiana;2011-08-30 11:20:00;11:45;White/Orange Light Ball in sky at night over louisiana We exited our living area to seeing this bright light in the sky. I asked for binoculours and took a closer look.  The light emitted seemed to be brighter than a star, and larger than anything I have ever seen in the sky, at the distance it was at.  We jumped in our kia soul, and drove to the hilltop, where we seen a plane in the area, which seemed to be going towards this light.  Came back home, and drove to our field, where we took multiple pictures of the light.  We caught it being still AND in motion.;32.7921;-91.91
