huge round green pulsing light floating toward the ground  outside Bastrop Louisiana;2004-06-07 23:30:00;25-30 seconds;huge round green pulsing light floating toward the ground  outside Bastrop Louisiana We were at Baron Ball Park in Bastrop,  Louisiana watching a game when my husband said look at that.....WE turned around and it was the oddest thing,  but very pretty.     It was a huge round green pulsing light descending towards the ground.     It was very graceful and just seemed to float.     I have seen many a falling star in this area,  but this was very different.     It appeared to fall over Winnsboro,  La.,  but that is only a guess.     It seemed to come out of the north and was falling in south east.     Other people may have seen it,  but I did not hear anyone say anything to that effect.     Do you have any idea what it was?;32.7921;-91.91
