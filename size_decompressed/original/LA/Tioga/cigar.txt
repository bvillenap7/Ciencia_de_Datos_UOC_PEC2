Cigar shaped object hovering approximately 100 feet in 30 knot wind making no sounds.;1990-05-15 17:50:00;10;Cigar shaped object hovering approximately 100 feet in 30 knot wind making no sounds. My fiancé and myself were driving down the road when we saw an object just hovering above the tree tops. We pulled over to a shopping center and watched this object for approximately ten minutes. It had two rows of lights on it, upper and a lower. The lights were going in different directions and would change colures. I estimated the length of it to be around 80 feet. And approximately 25 to 30 feet from top to bottom. I couldn’t tell how deep it was due to seeing it only from the side. This craft was hovering in a 30 to 35 knot wind making no sound. It was barely over the tree tops next to a four lane highway. At the time it was near dusk dark and all you could make out were the shape and colored lights. Amazingly enough no one else even acted like they saw it. I wanted to go underneath it to see more of it, but my fiancé would not have any part of that. After observing this craft for ten minutes from approximately 200 yards until it slowly few off to the SW.;31.3976;-92.6059
