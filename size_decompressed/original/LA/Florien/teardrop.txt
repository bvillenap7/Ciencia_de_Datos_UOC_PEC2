Saw the craft to the east of the vehicle and said, What in the hell is that? Second witness was driver who slowed to 10-15 mph to look. Saw craft described above. Appeared that the front was more pointed than the back but couldn't say for sure that the point was the front or back (assuming though that the point was the front.)  Driver held in view for about 10-15 seconds beyond this point when the vehicle moved to a point where view was obscured by trees. Craft was obscured for approx. 5-10 seconds and when the vehicle emerged, the craft was gone. No lights were visible on the craft. Appeared to be a dull, polished aluminum color. Sky was cloudless and sun was up. (Report submitted by driver);31.4275;-93.5179
