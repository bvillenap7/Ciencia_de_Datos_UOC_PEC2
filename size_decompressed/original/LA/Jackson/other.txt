Silent black helicopter.;1999-07-21 18:00:00;5 minutes;Silent black helicopter. I don't remember the exact date, but I was roughly 18 years old at the time.   My friend and I went to a field behind my house that at times held cattle.  It was mid to late afternoon, so it was beginning to get dark, and we had flashlights, but we didn't need to use them at the time.   When we walked through the tree line and entered the field we noticed roughly 30-40 yards away above a small patch of trees and a pond was a black helicopter.  My friend and I questioned what we were looking at for a moment because it was completely silent.   I remember pointing my flashlight at it and turning it on.  This caused the helicopter to turn and fly off as silently as it hovered.;30.812;-91.1968
