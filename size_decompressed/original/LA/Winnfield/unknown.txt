My 6-year old son and I walked outside to the car, and he says, Mom, look at that, it doesn't look like a plane.  Upon looking up, there was a large object moving very slowly across the sky.  It had red lights flashing.   I could not tell what shape exactly.  It was very low in the sky and I sent my son inside for my phone, so I could take a picture of it, but by the time he made it back out, it was vanished.  The sky where it had circled looked like the clouds do after an airplane comes thru, but really dark all around.  Two circular bright white objects also in the sky.  They were very bright, but stationery.  No movement, so it seemed.;31.9199;-92.6328
