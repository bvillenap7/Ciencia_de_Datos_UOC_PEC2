Red circular lights in the sky over the Gulf of Mexico.;2017-03-15 20:00:00;1 minute;Red circular lights in the sky over the Gulf of Mexico On March the 15th I was working just off the coast of Grand Isle, LA, on a Production Platform in the Gulf of Mexico.  Talking to my wife on my phone, and I noticed red circular lights in the sky, kinda like the lights from a projector from a casino.  We are 10 mile offshore and there are no typre of projectors, boats, or platforms that could make these type of lights.  It was dark outside and the time I first noticed the lights and when they disappeared was approximately 1 minute.  I did not have time to take a picture or film them. I have never seen anything like this before.  The light were going in a circular motion then disappeared.  I never saw a craft of any type, just the lights.  They were approximately 150 ft. off the water and only had the red lights, no color changes.;29.2331;-90.0111
