Triangular shaped craft seen on beach;2005-02-14 09:30:00;10 seconds;Triangular shaped craft seen on beach I was on vacation camping on the beach in Grand Isle, LA.  My husband, brother and I had only been there about a day.   My husband and I had been standing on the beach looking at the stars.  I had walked back up to the truck to do something, leaving my husband by the water about 15 feet away.   Immediately after opening the truck door and sitting down, something caught my eye in the sky.  Immediately I could not rationalize what it was.  I immediately stood up, took of running down the beach screaming my husbands name and to look in the air.   My husband looked in the air and watched in amazement at what he saw.  The object was pretty low and seemed like it floated through the air, not in a straight line.  It was either one triangular shaped craft with 3 circular lights on the bottom of it, or 3 circular crafts flying in a triangular formation. Also, I heard no noise when it was overhead.   My brother was by the campfire about 20 feet away,  my husband ran towards the camp yelling for him.  By the time My brother made it to the beach it had moved across the horizon and dissapeared.  And when I say dissapeared it was moving and then it was just gone.  I have drawn a very rough picture on my paint program on my computer.   I cannot explain what I saw and neither can my husband.  We stood there on that beach and watched the sky for the next couple of hours and seen nothing else in the sky that night.;29.2331;-90.0111
