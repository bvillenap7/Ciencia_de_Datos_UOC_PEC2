Object with three red lights, lights turned off as it ascended to treeline.;2014-07-04 21:00:00;3 minutes;Object with three red lights, lights turned off as it ascended to treeline It was about 8:30 pm, my mom and I were outside on the back patio.  I noticed a red light moving overhead to the west of us and pointed it out to her, asking what she though it could be.   On the underside of the object was a red light that was steady and did not pulsate.  It moved about the same speed as the planes we see flying by, landing at the airport in Baton Rouge.   I walked out into the yard to get a closer look, and two more bright red lights came on, one after the other, making a total of three lights in a small cluster.  The object appeared to be approaching us, ascending quickly and moving toward the trees where I was standing.   Then, as it reached the treeline, the lights shut off.  Because it was dusk, I could not see the shape of the object.   During the time of the object's ascent, what appeared to be a commercial liner was flying unusually low and to the west of the object, not on a course that I usually observe such planes taking.;30.4833142857143;-90.9038551020408
Object with two lights moving up and down in back yard.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report retracted by witness.  PD));2019-07-19 03:23:00;10 seconds +;Object with two lights moving up and down in back yard. One of our security cameras picked up a 10 second video of an object floating up and down in our back yard. Because it was approximately 3:30 am it was dark so all that could be seen was two lights which were rectangular in shape.  My husband and I thought it was a drone, but when we turned the sound up all that could be heard was crickets and night insects.  A raccoon was on the side of the shed out of view of the object and didnâ€™t seem to be aware of it. It started about half-way down the side of the shed, then slowly came down a little lower and then went up slowly and the video stopped when the object reached a height just above the top of the shed. A video captured 11 minutes previously showed nothing unusual and I have seen nothing like it before or since. ((ADDENDUM/RETRACTION SUBMITTED BY SOURCE OF REPORT)) Mistake I think my UFO is some kind of camera anomaly because I have found another video with a very similar (although not nearly as big) capture.  It occurred a few days later.  I believe it is something to do with moisture, heat and general atmospheric conditions.  Sorry!;30.4833142857143;-90.9038551020408
