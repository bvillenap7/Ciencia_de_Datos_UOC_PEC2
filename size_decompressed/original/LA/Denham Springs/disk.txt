Periph;2005-11-07 21:27:00;3 minutes;First sited around 21:27 moving at a very fast constant rate to the NW.  Object appeared to be disk-shaped, but standing on edge.  Periphery of object was circled with red and white lights of constant brightness (no strobe or rotation of lights).   Object did not appear to be rotating due to the fixed positions of the lights.  Object swept an angle of about 110 degrees before being obstructed by the eave of the house.  At arm's length, the disk was the diameter of a hand (about 2 1/2 inches).   To observe the object, you had to constantly be moving your eyes to keep up with it. No sound appeared to be coming from the object as it passed.;30.4833142857143;-90.9038551020408
Fireball becomes a saucer right in front of my eyes!!!;2010-08-29 21:00:00;3-4 min.;Fireball becomes a saucer right in front of my eyes!!! I was nearing the intersection where I would be turning right (south) towards I-12. Facing north, I noticed a fireball moving in the northeast night sky. I asked my friend, What is that?!, pointing it out. She locked on to it easily. The apparent flaming orb stopped moving and hovered. The flame went out and the object appeared as having red stationary lights, with white blinking lights. The light turned green and we darted straight across the highway (east). The lights seemed so close, perhaps within a couple hundred yards high.  Coming to a clearing in the trees on my left I saw it just hanging there!  I threw on the emergency brake and we both got out of the car.  I fumbled with my new phone wanting to take pics or video.  I was too rattled and unfamiliar with it to be successful. There was NO sound. I could make out the shape and surface texture of a metallic disk, the lights under the belly.  It was not smooth, but pitted like welding slag.  Our jaws were hanging for 20 seconds or so, then the disk turned on its axis and stood like a wheel.   I'm constantly asking, Do you see this??!  It moved SSW and when we turned to follow it, when I noticed cars were backing up behind us, and one driver was out of his car too.  He was looking at us asking what are you doing?.  I pointed over his head yelling A UFO!.  I didn't wait for him to react. We got back in the car and U-Turned to follow this thing, but never found it.  It was the single most bizarre event of my life!   The night sky was clear. about 79 deg. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
