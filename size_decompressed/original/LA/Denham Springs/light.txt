small flashing lights;2003-11-20 22:23:00;2-3 seconds;small flashing lights On three different occasions I have seen unusal lights in the same general area of the sky. On 11/20/03 at 20:00hrs I witnessed two lights, side by side, that were separated by approximately 1 degree. They flashed in unison twice. The color was about the same as a flash on a camera. The flashes were about 1 second or less apart. I went inside to get my binoculars. When I came back outside, I waited for the light to reappear, as it had before. It did reappear, but there was only one light and it was more round (it was still no larger than Mars looked recently, but this was not Mars)and the color was more of a yellow-orangish hue. It had also moved about 10 degrees to the east and only flashed once. I waited for more. At 20:23hrs the light came back between the positions of the other two sightings and seemed to twist and fade from blue-whte to a yellow-orange color. I have not seen them since. I wish I knew what they were. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed twinkling stars.  Just a guess.  PD));30.4833142857143;-90.9038551020408
Bright, white, circular light hovering in all directions in the east;2008-06-28 01:00:00;still ongoing;Bright, white, circular light hovering in all directions in the east The light I saw was the brightest star in the sky, that I could tell.  The white circular light was making subtile movements up, down, left, and right.  It almost seemed to be hovering. It remained still for a short time and then every minute or so it would move again. This light seems closer than that of the other stars.  I watched other stars and this one was different.  My boyfriend and I watched this light for 35 mins now.  We thought we should make sure we weren't crazy so we called a friend.  Our friend sat and watched from his house across town and saw the same as us.  That's when we decided to make this report.  We watched for about 35 minutes and kind of got freaked out and that's when we came in.  We will continue watching.  Our neighborhood doesn't have any lights so the sky is very clear.  We were observing from our front yard. We were not sure which direction it was in, so my boyfriend got a compass out of the attic. Our compass pointed twords the east.  Thank you for you time.;30.4833142857143;-90.9038551020408
Bright light hovering in the sky;2009-02-22 19:30:00;30 minutes;Bright light hovering in the sky On February 22 at approximately 7:20 my daughter and her fianc√© saw a bright object in the sky and alerted me to see it.  We were standing on my front porch and the object was hovering to the south east of us.  The object remains so far it has been there for about 30 minutes.  It appears to be moving very slowly and it has lights blinking red and blue and green.  It is appears to be near the Baton Rouge Airport.  We witnessed several planes flying, they appear to be commercial airplanes.  I recorded it with my digital camera.  I had to zoom in to capture it.  I noticed on camera you could see the lights rapidly changing colors.;30.4833142857143;-90.9038551020408
Unusual bright lights moving high in the night sky;2010-09-14 19:35:00;about 2 min.;Unusual bright lights moving high in the night sky Walking out of my mother's house last night, I casually looked into the sky and noticed a star that was just fading into visibility and moving north. This was not a meteor, as the light appeared constant and controlled. I pointed it out to my girlfriend but she couldn't track it before it faded out. Curiosity had me scanning the sky at this point. Within a minute, a brighter light caught my attention near the treetops, due north. She saw this one. It was a pure, bright, white light. More intense than any star or planet currently visible. We watched as it appeared to rise from its position and move across the sky towards SE, only not in a straight trajectory. The Baton Rouge airport is tens of miles west of my house, and an airplane (at or near cruising altitude) was also apparent, serving as a means of comparison. Seeing that the light was not fading, I quickly went back to the door of the house to get another witness. The man saw it, and wondered out loud what it could be.

Glowing green light appeared for a few seconds over interstate 12 glided downward and disappeared.;2014-01-31 22:30:00;3-4 seconds;Glowing green light appeared for a few seconds over interstate 12 glided downward and disappeared. My friend and I were driving on I-12 about to exit by Denham Springs when this glowing greenish white light appeared in the sky-WAY to close to be a shooting star, and to close to be an airplane, or helicopter.   It glided so smoothly downwards unlike any aircraft I've ever seen before then the light appeared to go out or disappear.  I've never seen anything like it.

Unlike anything I've seen in the night sky before.;2015-05-26 21:00:00;1 minute;Unlike anything I've seen in the night sky before I witnessed a light moving at a constant speed from west to east across the sky.  This light was moving faster than any plane or helicopter I've seen and moved slower than a shooting star.  It did not blink.  It appeared to ascend as it moved across the sky until it disappeared from sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Not the ISS, which was not visible at the time and date indicated by the witness.
