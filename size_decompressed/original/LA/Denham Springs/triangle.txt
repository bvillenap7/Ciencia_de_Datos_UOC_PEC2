Wing shaped grouping of white dots/lights;2019-10-02 22:45:00;4-5 seconds;Wing shaped grouping of white dots/lights Male, age 64, just witnessed a fast-moving triangular structure moving in the southeast direction above Livingston Parish, Louisiana.  It appeared to be a grouping of dim white lights (10-20 lights) shaped in a triangular wing shape.  Movement was very smooth, no erratic or sudden changes in movement, speed or direction. Could hear a muffled sound as it passed.  The object crossed my vision for 4-5 seconds.;30.4833142857143;-90.9038551020408
