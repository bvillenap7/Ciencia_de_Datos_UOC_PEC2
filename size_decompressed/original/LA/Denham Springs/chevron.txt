My wife and I were sitting on our 2nd floor balcony of our apartment.  I was watching an airliner traveling Eastbound on the Easternmost horizon. An object caught my eye which I first thought was a large very white bird flying Westward from the Eastern horizon. I noticed that this object was V shaped and there was no wings flapping.  The object was traveling fast Westbound. I asked my wife, do you see that?  She said, yes, what was that?  The object traveled across the whole sky in maybe 4-5 seconds, maximum.  It appeared to be around 5- 10 thousand feet high. My backgroung is law enforcement, and military advisor, served in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan.;30.4833142857143;-90.9038551020408
