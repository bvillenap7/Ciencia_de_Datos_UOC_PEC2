My son first spotted it. If he had said it looked like a UFO, I wouldn't have bothered looking.  But, he said it was a blimp.  But, when I looked, I knew instantly that it was NOT a blimp.  This is what I saw:  A long, cylindrical shaped something shiney silvery-white color by this I mean, at times it appeared to be glowing white, but then it would look silver there was no sound no contrail it was about the size of an airplane, but nose not pointed, no wings, just a cylinder shape.   Saw it very clearly.   It seemed to be close, about 1/8 mile up in the sky.  Appeared at first to be floating.  And, was moving slowly, horizontally, instead of up and at an angle the way planes do.  Although it seemed to be floating and moving slowly, it crossed the sky into a small dot within one minute!   Don't really know how to express how weird it was.  Weirdest thing I have ever seen.  Didn't have time to get a picture.  It happened too fast.;30.4833142857143;-90.9038551020408
