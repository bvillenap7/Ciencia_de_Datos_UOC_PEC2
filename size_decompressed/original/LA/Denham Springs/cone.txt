Three bright red objects moving across the evening sky.;2014-11-27 05:45:00;30 seconds;Three Bright Red Objects moving Across the Evening Sky I was walking my dog right at dark today and looked to the Northeast.  Three cone shaped, bright red objects were moving in formation across the sky to the Southwest.  They were evenly spaced in a formation with the one in the middle higher than the other two.   As they went behind a tree, I waited for them to reappear in the sky.  Two had disappeared behind the tree and one proceeded on toward the Southwest.   These objects were very bright red, very high, and made no sound whatsoever.  There were no blinking lights, as on airplanes.   I have seen the International Space Station move across the sky and I would say these were moving at about the same speed, though I have no way of judging how high the were.;30.4833142857143;-90.9038551020408
