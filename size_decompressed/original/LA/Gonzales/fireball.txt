Magic came down to earth.;1990-12-24 23:00:00;In a trailer park;Magic came down to earth. Believe me or not, my brother and me at the age of 5&6 were anxiously waiting for Santa Claus to deliver presents.  While we were looking out the window this glitter substance started to come down to earth and even though me and my brother were so young when we seen it, it was amazing and my brother says the same.   As the craft slowly came towards the ground it was like it was spooked then it quickly started to go back into the sky, awesome.   I'm a big believer in the Lord Jesus Christ but I believe that this was something incredible possibly not from this earth I don't know.  But sometimes you think that your living a special life. I'm not crazy, probably one of the most average Americans you have ever seen. I'm attending medical school now to educate myself about this extrodinary planet that we are now lifing on.
