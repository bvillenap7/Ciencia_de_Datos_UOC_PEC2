Gigantic ufo near Gonzales, LA;2000-10-14 18:30:00;30 seconds;Gigantic ufo near Gonzales, LA My son and I were traveling north on U.S. hwy. 61 outside Gonzales, La. I was looking at the unusual number of contrails in the sky to the west of the town, when we both noticed what at first we thought was an extremely large airplane banner in the sky at about 2 o'clock high. It was rectangular in shape. Then we realized that there was no plane in front, and it was not moving. It looked to be about 2 miles away, and appeared to be the size of a football field. We observed it for about 30 seconds, until trees blocked the view. On subsequent trips past this area, we haven't seen anything that could resemble it, so we know it wasn't something that we mistook for a ufo (like a billboard, microwave tower, etc.).;30.2459;-90.9158
