Bright orange fiery upside down teardrop floating slowly under clouds in a straight line in Gonzales, LA.;2011-02-26 19:15:00;45 seconds;Bright orange fiery upside down teardrop floating slowly under clouds in a straight line in Gonzales, LA. Direction of origin unknown. Bright, fiery orange upside down teardrop, with a more rounded tip, floating from one horizon to another. Slightly glowing and pulsating. Flying below clouds as far as we could tell. Much too slow to be a shooting star or comet, even lacking a tail that either of those would have. Direction of pulsating glow upwards toward and from the larger round part of the teardrop, but, with focus, seemed like it was made up of many small lights, resembling tightly gathered Christmas Tree lights. Path was a straight line, as it seemed. We observed it until out of sight. The witnesses : Heavy Equipment Operator, father, college student, mother. No drug/alcohol use...expecting a child.
