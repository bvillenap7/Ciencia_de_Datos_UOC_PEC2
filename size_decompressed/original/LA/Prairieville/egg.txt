My wife and I were driving down Interstate 10 going east at around 5 pm. It was still clear daylight. A bright, glowing (imagine molten steel as a comparison) clearly defined egg shaped object came down vertically, very fast. At about tree level, it disappeared. It made no sound, and left no trail. The entire sequence lasted about 3 seconds.;30.3064;-90.9427
