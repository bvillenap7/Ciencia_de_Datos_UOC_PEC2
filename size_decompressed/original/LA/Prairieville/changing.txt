Strange object changes shap over my house in Louisiana.;2008-01-01 21:00:00;1 min;Strange object changes shap over my house in Louisiana. Around 9 pm central time on Jan 1st  I was walking back from my neighbors house and looked up to admire how clear the sky was.  I heard then saw a commercial airliner crossing the sky.  It was very clear and moving fast.  Then I noticed another object flying in an exact opposite path that appeared to be a bit lower.  Its lights weren’t as bright as the planes but it had the same shape and size.  It looked like one object with a light on the nose, wingtips, and tail.  The tail light was red and the others where white.  I thought it was another plane until it moved sideways as it was going forward.  Not turning with the front light staying in front but more like drifting.  It also didn’t make a sound.  By now the jet was long gone.   This really caught my attention.  As it moved away, the lights on either side began to move inward into a single file line, still moving forward with the entire line shifting to the right all at once and continuing on its forward path.  I watched it for a few more seconds and then  it just vanished.  No noise was ever heard from the object. I am a 36 year old male.  My wife and I own a karate school and a cabinet shop.  I’m not a big drinker and have never used drugs.  I have some collage education.  No troubles with the police.  I feel that I’m a very likeable person and am very credible. I hope this helps.;30.3064;-90.9427
