On the night July 04, 2008 we were outside shooting fireworks and noticed a very bright orange light in the sky. We live in Prairieville, LA a few miles south of Baton Rouge. The object was fairly low and was definitely “flying”. There were 8 people in our group that witnessed this object. It appeared three different times in about a 20 minute time span. In made no noise and was definitely not an airplane or helicopter. The sighting report in Indiana on July 04 on the National UFO Reporting website seems to be the same object we saw.;30.3064;-90.9427
