They were all over the place kinda zigzag like.  Then one of the two sped up.   We kept watching and about 10 more flew over in about an hour criss crossing like they were patrolling the area..  We assumed that they were military, but the movements were so quick and unlike anything we had seen before.   Even after looking for YouTube videos we could not find any that compare.  If it was military, we haven't been told of this technology.   May have something to do with terror attack in Paris hours before sighting.;30.266675;-91.24475
