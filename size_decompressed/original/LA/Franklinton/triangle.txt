Could not tell how thick or tall.  Then it seem that a bright spot light appeared it came from under the craft.  As It fell from under the craft I saw it was a orb of some kind.  I was freaking me out at the time did not know if it was going to come towards me or if I should call the Police, Air Force, ? then I thought they were going to think I was crazy.  The orb then went done the river south towards the lake made a lite humming and static sound . The big craft would keep going North up the river no sound that was spooky and it went out of site.  I been afraid to say anything to anyone I know.  Have not to this day said anything.;30.8577;-90.1154999999999
