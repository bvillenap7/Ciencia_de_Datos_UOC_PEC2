Red, green,and white lights hovering over WNW of Franklinton,La. with 3 other objects flickering lights to the North of the main UFO towards Fort Polk La. Five planes comming from the North, East, and South going towards the UFO, then the lights of the UFO went off. The planes flew right past where the UFO was and continued to move West ward. A few min. later the lights reappeared in the same place as before. My wife and I watched the UFO for about 10 min. as it moved towards the  WNW. The sky was clear and the stars were bright it was the strangest thing I've seen. We watched other planes moving across the sky but nothing like this. My wife grabed her 35mm digital camera but we couldn't get it focused in on the UFO without the proper lens.;30.8577;-90.1154999999999

It got so loud that I couldn't hear the tv.   At first I thought it was thunder in the distance but as it came closer to the house i truly believed it was either a tornado or plane crashing into the house.  It was a clear night and the moon was full so I knew it wasn't bad weather.   I ran outside as it went over the house and into the field across the road.  The shape was blacked out and all i could see were the different colored lights as it slowly moved further away.  It stopped at one point, turned and flew slowly in a different direction.  Scared me so bad, I thought I was going to have a heart attack!   We seen red flaming orbs in the back field several years ago that were flying straight up, then went 3 different ways.;30.8577;-90.1154999999999
