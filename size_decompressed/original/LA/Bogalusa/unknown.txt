When I happened to notice a red light in the sky, headed towards us.  We thought it was just a airplane. We kept watching it.  As it got closer I observed that there was no noise.  At this time what we seen was a red light like on a pole.wasn't strobing, nor was it blinking.  Just a constant red light.  It was heading in a northeast direction. then it turned heading in a east direction.  We watched a total of approximenly 15 minutes.  Then it seemed to disappear.  It should be noted that when it was passing us it appeared to be surrounded by a cloud.which stayed with it as it moved.  It was approximately 200 feet high and approximately 500 feet away from us.
