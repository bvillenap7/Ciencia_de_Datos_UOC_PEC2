The craft then I could tell was indeed round and was blocking out the stars as it passed heading north to south at a slow speed making no noise and emitting no light but a reflection on the leading edge as it neared the southern edge of town near bens ford wildlife management area it took off at an extreme rate of speed with no sound;30.7733;-89.8653
