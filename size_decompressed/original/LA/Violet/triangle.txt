I look up and i saw 3 lights above me in the shape of an equalateral triangle.  i brought the dogs inside they seemed a bit shooken up by something.  I went back outside and looked and i saw the same craft and out of nowhere a second triangle craft next to the other, bright blue beams shooting off of it. the first disappeared and i blacked out when i woke up it was 12:00 am on 8/2/2011   Im not sure what happened when i looked up the crafts were gone.;29.9014;-89.8906
