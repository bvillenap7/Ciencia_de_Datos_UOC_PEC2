I have given the best description I could. App. alt. 15,000ft - speed 500mph (best guess) - no sound, no wings - flight path north west by south east. Craft was complete light, a bright yellow that seemed to have a source from front and back that met in the middle. Slightly overcast with sun very low & setting so I don't believe the color was reflection.  It looked to me to be self contained light & color. Length to width ratio seemed to hint it would not be a very fast craft.;32.9101;-93.6869
