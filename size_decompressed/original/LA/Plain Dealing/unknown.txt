Looked almost like a cell tower light but much brighter.  Could see other air craft flying in near vicinity of this but not chasing or approaching it.  I shut the door for a few minutes and reopened it and it was gone and a few minutes later it reappeared.  It finally disappeared, didnâ€™t fly away where you could follow it, just disappeared.;32.9101;-93.6869
