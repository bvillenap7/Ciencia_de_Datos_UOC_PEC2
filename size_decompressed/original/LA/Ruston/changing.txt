Large group of flashing lights moving very slow;2012-06-18 21:30:00;5 minutes;Large group of flashing lights moving very slow While leaving my girlfriend's apartment in Ruston, LA, I glanced back as I was unlocking my truck to see between 50 and 100 flashing lights that appeared to be flying well under the normal altitude of an aircraft.  I immediately ran back inside to get her and her brother to come see what i was looking at, because I couldnt believe my eyes.  Immediately after they walked outside and looked up, they too were astonished at the site.  The lights were moving in unisome, but sort of changed shapes to make these different amoebic forms as it went across the night sky in a Northwest direction.  I'm very much a pessimist and non-believer in the extra-terrestrial, but after tonight, I have no idea what to think.;32.5302032786885;-92.650824590164
