Reddish/orange balls of light over Ruston.;2013-10-14 19:30:00;15 minutes;Reddish/orange balls of light over Ruston. Five reddish/orange balls of light, came slowly from the city over the horizon.  Two in a group and three in a triangular group, then two more came over the horizon, then another.  No sound or blinking lights.  When I got to the store I pointed them out to two shoppers and a clerk but by then there was only three in sight.;32.5302032786885;-92.650824590164
