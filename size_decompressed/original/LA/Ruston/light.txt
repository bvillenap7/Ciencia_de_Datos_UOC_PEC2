The Object was a light. I got focused my teloscope on it and saw that it had lights blinking on it, a red light on top and a blue light on bottom, at first I thought it was a plane but I observed it for about 3 Hours! So I knew then that it wasnt a plane. It was slowy moving to the east and getting farther way, My Dad, Mom, sister and my sisiters boyfriends also saw it. I was the only one to look through the teloscope at it, the lights didnt really blink, they rotated, like a airport light does. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness means 8:00 p.m., and we have changed the time here.  We suspect they may have been witnessing a celestial object, but that is only a guess.
