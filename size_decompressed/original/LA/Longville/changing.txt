AT FIRST WE THOUGHT IT WAS A PLANE, THEN  AS WE WERE WATCHING IT, IT FLARRED UP INTO A RED BURNING BALL OF FIRE (AT LEAST IT LOOKED LIKE FIRE). THE FIRE BALL LASTED A VERY UNUSUALLY LONG TIME, SO IT WAS NOT A FLARE OR EXPLOSION. THEN AS WE WATCHED, THE FIRE BALL SEEMED TO GO OUT, AND TWO RED LIGHTS (JUST LIKE THE ONE ORIGINALLY SEEN) WENT IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. IT LOOKED LIKE ONE WENT WEST AAND ONE WENT SOUTH. THEY DID NOT ZIP AWAY QUICKLY, INSTEAD THEY SEEMED TO JUST WINK OUT.;30.5798;-93.2554
