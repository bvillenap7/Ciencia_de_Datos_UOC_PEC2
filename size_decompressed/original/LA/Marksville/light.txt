Golden object moving across the night sky.;2012-07-15 01:00:00;15-25 minutes;Golden object moving across the night sky. My friends and I were getting ready to play a late-night round of air soft. I have a habit of observing the skies at night, ironically enough looking for UFO events.  I looked to the southeast at about a 35 degree angle, when I noticed a star that was slightly bigger then the others.  As I was observing it, it slowly drifted lazily down and to the left.  I called my friend over and for around 15 to 25 minutes we watched it.  It would stop moving about every five minutes.  It would just drift more and more to the horizon. It moved VERY slowly.  When it was about 20 degrees above the horizon, we saw a plane fly in itâ€™s direction.  It then moved at a very quick speed down, before it disappeared on the horizon. The object looked just like a star, just bigger. And a golden-yellow color, almost as if it was engulfed in a golden light.
