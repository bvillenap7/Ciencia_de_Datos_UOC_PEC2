I went out to the Spring Bayou landing to look at the stars to kill some time, and as I was laying there, my neck hairs began to raise. I sat up, and a dog came running wild eyed from behind me with his hackles up, and I saw a craft that was triangular slowly flying over the trees across the bayou. It made no sound and the trees did not move or make any noise, either. The craft was about 60 feet long and was kind of dented in on the bottom like an upside tea cup plate. As it drifted over the treeline, it came to an abrupt stop, tipped upwars and began to lower itself into the trees. I know of no known aircraft or helocopter that can do this withoutmoving the leaves and branches on the trees around it. After coming out of the mild shock I was in, I jumpedin the car and drove up Spring Bayou Road as fast as I could. I passed the dog about a mile from where we originally where and he was'nt slowing down either.

It was a triangle shaped object with lights, hovering over a small airport next to a casino.;2002-05-07 21:30:00;3 minutes;It was a triangle shaped object with lights, hovering over a small airport next to a casino. I was driving north on Hwy 1 about 1/2 mile from casino when I noticed an object to my left across the street over our small country airport.  It was a triangle shaped object with lights flashing up and down around the shape of the triangle.  It just hovered there.  I drove slow watching it.  As I got in front of the casino and stopped at the red light I looked back and it slowly started to move.  I lost sight when I moved on.  This is my third sighting since we moved to this area 8 years ago.  And this was the only time I didn't have witnesses.  I remember my teacher from junior high saying he had seen the same thing several years before.;31.1396;-92.0831
