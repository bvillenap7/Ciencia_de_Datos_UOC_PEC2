The weather was clear and cool, around 70 degrees. As I rounded the corner to the front of the homes'exterior, I handed some material to a co-worker whom was overhead on a scaffolding. I noticed 3 faintly visible colors in the sky. They were red, yellow and blue, respectively. The sat motionless in the sky, a fair distance apart from one another in no particular formation. Then as I started to point out the objects to the rest of the co-workers, 4 additional objects appeared from my right. They were also very high up and varied in color, 2 yellow, a red, and a white, respectively.They approached the original 3 crafts slowly, where they made an enclosed, triangled formation briefly. Then they broke apart and slowly disappeared into the blue abyss of the sky, some moving outward and disappearing while the others plainly just disappeared. One co-worker thought they may have been high altitude skydivers at first, but they never did descend and when they disappeared, he was left completely astounded.

White lights.;2015-06-18 04:30:00;30-45 minutes;I saw numerous slow moving white lights.  I flashed my led light at one and it just stopped instantly.  I have Dr. Greer's contact app so I started playing some of the tones on the app and then saw numerous more of the same types of lights coming from different directions. 2 of them even crisscrossed each other's path.   The lights were not blinking on them except for the last craft I saw.  It didn't flicker like a light on a plane either, it just seemed to get brighter then slowly dim.   Needless to say, I was pretty blown away by all of this.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
