UFO report communicated by Thomas Jefferson;2000-04-05 20:00:00;15 seconds;UFO report communicated by Thomas Jefferson From:   http://www.ufodigest.com/article/report-concerning-unidentified-flying-object-communicated-thomas-jefferson   This one page notice appeared in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society vol. 6 Part 1 (Philadelphia, 1804), p. 25.  At the time it was written, Thomas Jefferson was president of the Society and also Vice President of the United States.   Apparently it was written and submitted by the naturalist William Dunbar, and communicated or presented to the society by Jefferson.  Unfortunately, the plate referred to is missing.

Description of a singular Phenomenon seen at Baton Rouge, by William Dunbar, Esq. communicated by Thomas Jefferson, President A. P. S. Natchez,  June 30th, 1800. Read 16th January 1801. A PHENOMENON was seen to pass Baton Rouge on the night of the 5th April 1800, of which the following is the best description I have been able to obtain. It was first seen in the South West, and moved so rapidly, passing over the heads of the spectators, as to disappear in the North East in about a quarter of a minute.  It appeared to be of the size of a large house, 70 or 80 feet long and of a form nearly resembling Fig. 5. in Plate, iv. It appeared to be about 200 yards above the surface of the earth, wholly luminous, but not emitting sparks of a colour resembling the sun near the horizon in a cold frosty evening, which may be called crimson red.   When passing right over the heads of the spectators, the light on the surface of the earth, was little short of the effect of sun-beams, though at the same time, looking another way, the stars were visible, which appears to be a confirmation of the opinion formed of its moderate elevation.  In passing, a considerable degree of heat was felt but no electric sensation.  Immediately after it disappeared in the North East, a violent rushing noise was heard, as if the phenomenon was bearing down the forest before it, and in a few seconds a tremendous crash was heard similar to that of the largest piece of ordnance, causing a very sensible earthquake. I have been informed, that search has been made in the place where the burning body fell, and that a considerable portion of the surface of the earth was found broken up, and every vegetable body burned or greatly scorched. I have not yet received answers to a number of queries I have sent on, which may perhaps bring to light more particulars.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
3 blinking objects traveled at different times from the same side across the sky fairly fast.;2000-12-17 20:40:00;5 mins;3 blinking objects traveled at different times from the same side across the sky fairly fast. I was taking out the trash for my mom and coming back in when i saw a blinking light going pretty fast through the sky.  I thought it might be a jet so I kept walking.  Right before I went in I started to think a second and realized I heard no jet sound.  So i watched it go through the sky as I walked down the street following it, trying to listen for a sound.  I couldn't hear any.  I got a little freaked out, but thought my imagination was getting the best of me so I started walking back home.  On the way I saw another one coming the same direction from the same side {right side facing down my driveway).  I thought maybe the craft had spun around so I looked back and in the distance I saw the other one I had previously seen.  So I stopped and watched it also.  It also flew fairly fast, and faster than any helicopter or commercial plane I had seen.  Again I listened, but I still heard no sound.  I stood and watched the two crafts go off onto the horizon.  That happened within 2 minutes.  I stood in awe wondering what I had seen for about 30 seconds when I saw another blinking light go through the sky from the same direction on the left side of me.  It was going a bit faster then the other 2 and I watched and listened as carefully as I could as it also traveled to the horizon.  It crossed the whole sky in about 15-25 seconds.  I stood there for about 5 minutes after, watching for any other objects but didnt see any.  I coudn't tell the shape of it at all.  All I saw was a blinking light.  By blinking I mean, I saw a white light flash at different times.  It definitely didn't look like an actual light blinking.  It looked more like the objects were spinning and a piece of the object was shiny or a metal of somthing that reflects light.  It looked as if that piece of the object was reflecting a light source from which I could not tell.  The moon wasn't out at the time so I figured it wasnt that.  The sky was completely clear so I don't think it was a spotlight on the clouds either.  Thats all I know! .  The o nly observer was myself.  I'm 17 years old, white male, I go to Woodlawn High School, I've never seen had any spotting before.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
Stranges Lights Around Baton Rouge River Center 12/11/09;2009-12-11 18:20:00;6 minutes;Stranges Lights Around Baton Rouge River Center 12/11/09 I was headed toward downtown Baton Rouge Friday Night about 6:20 pm...  A very dark rainy night.  I saw 3 lights in a straight line, red on both ends and white in the middle, the red lights blinked in an alternating pattern. In a straight line the lights moved from horizontal to vertical.  Top red middle white bottom red. Lights were much higher in the sky than radio/cell phone towers.  These lights seem to be too stationary to be an Air Plane.  There was also another stationary white light, possibly a helicopter. Closer to the ground, but far away from the other lights.  The singular white light moved under the three other lights, still much closer to the grown.  Once the white light lined up under the three lights, they turn into one  non blinking red light, and quickly goes into the distance.

Very low and slow moving bright, blurry light spotted during a very close encounter;2013-09-26 03:00:00;30 minutes;Very low and slow moving bright, blurry light spotted during a very close encounter My sighting happened on September 26, 2013. I work the early morning shift for a local news station. I decided to go on a smoke break right around 3:00 AM. I exited out the back door. The only thing in the back is grass and woods. I have seen small and distant sightings before but nothing like this.  As I’m smoking my cigarette, I looked to my right and as soon as I turned my head, I saw a bright, shiny light coming around the corner of the office building. I also noticed an orange light inside of the bright light.  The bright light appeared to be extremely blurry and moving at a very slow speed. It is very hard to explain and to put into words. The shininess of the light almost made it appear as if it was floating water or a jelly-like substance. It was extremely low to the ground and got as close as thirty feet from me before shooting up. The object didn’t shoot up much higher than it already was, but it was high enough to have to look up at the object. It then began moving West before disappearing.  During this time, I am also tried to take my cell phone out to take try to record the object. I opened my camera and switched to video mode. The grid appeared on my screen and the object was in clear sight on my phone. However, as I’m trying to press the “record” button, it will not record. I pressed it several times trying to get it to record until it disappeared.  Once I lost sight of the object, I thought that it had disappeared. All of a sudden, the light zooms back at a much faster pace right above me before heading northwest. All of my previous sightings have never been reported. I would see them and keep them to myself. This sighting was much different. When I saw the light, there was a huge and unexplainable rush of excitement that overtook my body.  I walked back into the office almost in a trance-like state. I went straight to my computer and noticed that it was 3:30 AM. A whole thirty minutes had gone by. Smoke breaks are only five minutes and ten minutes at max. I used the Internet to find the number and called the local Baton Rouge Air Patrol. A lady answered the phone and informed me that the tower in my city closes at 11:00 PM. She went on to ask more questions and was very intrigued with the details. She also mentioned that there were multiple sightings within the month that had been called into Air Patrol but nothing like mine in regards to how close it all happened. This sighting was as real as it gets and I will never be the same because of it. It left me completely speechless.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295

It was not a shooting star because it would have burned out quickly.   The bright light was silent as it passed over, I continued to watch for any signs of a crash.  To me it appeared as an airplane entering back into the atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the sighting occurred on Saturday, July 12th, 2014, but we have no means of contacting the witness, who elects to remain totally anonymous, and who provides no contact information.

Bright light over Amite River @ Bayou Manchac.;2014-08-19 21:20:00;10 seconds;Bright light over Amite River @ Bayou Manchac It was a really bright light shining down (maybe the same elevation as small plane/crop duster).  I saw the bright light for a few seconds then it shut off but I could still see a dim light.  I did not hear any engine noise.  The aircraft then traveled in an upward/Northern direction. I could no longer see it after about 4 to 5 seconds.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
At least 20 bright orange/gold lights moving across the sky in Baton Rouge.;2014-11-20 21:30:00;10 minutes;At least 20 bright orange/gold lights moving across the sky in Baton Rouge. As I was driving down Airline Highway in Baton Rouge at about 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 20th, I saw several orange/gold lights up in the sky to my left.  Then I noticed there were many of these lights.  They were not blinking.  Once in a while, they would appear to twinkle.   Since I was driving, I couldn't tell if they were moving or not, so I pulled into a parking lot to watch.  The lights were moving, all to the northeast.  As I watched, more lights appeared from out of the southwest, and moved in the same direction as the other lights.   These lights were larger than the size of the planet Venus when it can be seen shining brightly in the sky--probably three times the size.   Once they moved past me, I would lose sight of them, but more and more kept coming.  A plane or helicopter with flashing lights appeared and seemed to be going in a wide circle in the area.   After about 10 minutes, no more lights came out of the southwest.   I don't know exactly how many lights I had seen, but at least 20.   I have no idea what these were, and I have not seen any news reports locally about these strange very bright orange/gold lights.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
Multiple orange lights on 17th, one blue/purple on 16th, Baton Rouge, Highland/Jefferson.;2015-01-17 21:00:00;2 nights (16th);Multiple orange lights on 17th, one blue/purple on 16th, Baton Rouge, Highland/Jefferson. I was at a friend's on January 16th.  He had been trying to tell me about these lights in the sky around his home.  They appear consistently every night.  I never paid attention. He called me outside, and I had my first experience with this when I saw a light that was approximately 4-5 hundred yards away.   It hovered, floated and was neon purple and blue.  Almost like a firework in its brightness. It was absolutely silent.  It changed from purple to blue. It rose up in the air above the treeline and went left about 200 yards. The, went back right.  It then hovered for a while and sank below the trees.  We have video of this. The next night I was home but he called me to tell me there were up to 20 orange ones, some in formation and some not.  They were going into formation, then breaking away. Some were going in circles.  They appear out of the middle of the sky and disappear the same way.  This is a common occurence for them.   I did an Internet search and several, several people saw the same thing.  I am attaching video of what he saw on the 17th.  It is very impressive.   My question as a skeptic is why in this world, are we not trying to explain and find out with government resources what these things are?   And on a side note-I went to Thailand personally and saw with my own eyes Chinese lanterns.  They are not the size of small cars.  And they do not move like planes.   And they are easily followed with the eyes, as they rise from the earth where they are let go.  And Chinese lanterns are illegal in Louisiana.   Could someone please explain this?;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
