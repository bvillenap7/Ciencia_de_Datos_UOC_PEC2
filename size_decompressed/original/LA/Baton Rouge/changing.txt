Stationary but too low for a star and changed shape continually.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Venus.  PD));2015-10-03 02:00:00;1 hour;Stationary but too low for a star and changed shape continually. About 2am was going to bed and looked at night sky from our second story balcony.  Saw what I thought to be a star but noticed it was low.  It was almost due EAST &gt far away but too low for a star. I got my binoculars and watched it change shapes and seemed to have lots of lights.  It would change from a circle to a serpent type shape.  I watched & watched but I was getting sleepy.  I was telling myself it was a satellite. I just went to balcony again tonight 10-5-15 and stars are out in the sky, but that UFO is GONE !!!!;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
