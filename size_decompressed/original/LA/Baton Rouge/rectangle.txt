Low altitude square cloud with vapor trail photo’d in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.;2011-02-08 13:25:00;Minutes;Low altitude square cloud with vapor trail photo’d in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. While driving pass the Woman’s Hospital in Baton Rouge I witnessed a square object in the sky that looked like a perfectly square cloud.   I slowed and shot a photo from my driver’s window.  The square was distorted some in the photo probably due to the brightness.  It appeared as though there was a light puffy cloud trail behind the square.   I continued to drive on and the object was stationary in a perfectly clear sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Photo indicates a large blotch of white light, against a blue sky.  We wonder whether the light might have been the reflection of the flash on the camera, but the witness claims to have seen the object, before he took the photo.  We do not know what the object is.
