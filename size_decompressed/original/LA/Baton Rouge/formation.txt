Solid lighted aircraft flying in a V formation.;2008-10-08 20:50:00;< 1 minute;Solid lighted aircraft flying in a V formation. The aircraft were flying in a V pattern moving very fast at a high altitude from north to south disappearing over LSU campus.  The craft appeared to be solid white lights.  They did not have flashing like typical aircraft.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295

I was outside with my parents and we were loading a washing machine for a family member.  I looked up and saw one bright light.  The light was brighter than the stars.  It cycled between white, blue, and red.          At first, I thought it was a helicopter, but I looked closer and it was cigar shaped.  Then, following directly behind it was another craft, that was bright white.  Then, once the clouds cleared, there was at least ten craft in a diamond formation.   The white craft was the front point of the diamond.  The other craft were pale blue in the formation.  I got to look at them for at least 15 seconds, but then clouds covered them up.  The first craft I saw was bigger than the rest, because I could see its shape.  Its light was also brighter than the ! other craft. It could possibly be a mothership.

White lights flying in a string very fast and very high due North.  ((anonymous report));2018-03-22 21:15:00;10 minutes;White lights flying in a string very fast and very high due North. The formation of white lights appeared very much like a flying flock of white birds, only flying much higher and much faster than an airplane.  They sort of looked like a string of jellyfish in the sky, flying in a curved/almost v-shape formation.  I saw approximately five of these formations fly by over a span of approximately ten minutes, and they were all flying North.  It was a fairly clear night.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
Line of light moving across the sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 20:50:00;5 minutes;Line of light moving across the sky Witnessed a line of circular lights coming across the sky from the direction of Venus heading south. Visible dots of light moving in a perfect line formation. Each dot followed the one before it in a single file, perfectly spaced pattern. They continued to cross the sky in this manner for approximately 5 minutes as we watched. We estimate there were approximately 20 dots of light. At some point a plane was descending at the nearby airport underneath the procession of lights and appeared much lower in the sky in comparison.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
