Bright Green Fireball followed by a tail of orange sparks;1998-11-03 05:00:00;1-2 secs;Bright Green Fireball followed by a tail of orange sparks While taking a smoke break outside at work, just before dawn, I saw what I first thought was a Roman Candle, or some kind of firework, then I realized: 1, it was the wrong time of year 2, it was too high in the sky and far away. I'v worked nights for 13 years, and have seen many shooting stars, but none like this. It was a Bright Green ball, followed by a trail of orange sparks. It was about softball sized, to the North, falling from West to East. It disapeared behind the building next to me after only a sec or two. The sky was very clear and starry, and although the siting was brief, the image was very clear.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
Flaming Ball over Baton Rouge;2007-08-04 20:30:00;7 minutes;Flaming Ball over Baton Rouge On August 4th around 8:30 PM myself and 3 others were in my car on the corner of Monterrey Blvd and Greenwell Springs Road in Baton Rouge, Louisiana when we saw a huge flaming mass traveling south over Baton Rouge. From our vantage point it appeared to be above the Siegen Lane area however it was most likely over the Gulf.  The mass was over the size of several airplanes in my opinion. While we were observing, it broke into 4 separate pieces that appeared to be the size of an airplane.  Now to put some size reference on what I mean by the size of an airplane, when you look up into the sky and see a jet flying overhead at the highest point you have seen one, then you understand what I mean by the size of an airplane.  Unfortunately we did not think to whip out our cell phones and take a picture, we were in awe of what we were seeing. I have yet to see anything on this in the news. We did not see any other streaks across the sky that may have given us the thought that it was just a meteor shower.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295

Fire Ball object with comet like tail changing directions and dropping flares over Baton Rouge;2008-08-08 23:00:00;10 minutes;Fire Ball object with comet like tail changing directions and dropping flares over Baton Rouge While traveling in my automobile west bound on Interstate I-12 just before the I-12 ,I-10 split in Downtown Baton Rouge at 8:30 PM I noticed a bright object in the night sky. The object at first appeared stationary at an altitude of approximately 4000 feet. Then the object began dropping flare like objects that were falling directly towards the ground. It appeared as if it were an object that was on fire and breaking apart. Similar to an aircraft and/or a spacecraft re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. However, the object began changing directions moving at a slow speed. Then object then developed a comet like tail but much shorter in length than a normal comet. The object resembled a fireball but it never appeared to lose altitude. It remained at the same height and speed. The object flew directly towards the West approaching the Mississippi River and then turned to a Southerly direction. It would make very sharp turns, in fact, the turning radius was such that the object appeared to almost cross paths with it's on fiery tail.  The object would drop flare like objects intermittently similar to a military aircraft dispersing flares. Again having the appearance of an object on fire and breaking apart but the object continued flying at the apparent same speed and altitude. It made several complete circles and then reversed it's original course of due west and began traveling back toward my direction at an Easterly heading. The object had no visible navigation lights. No blinking lights or anything indicating that it were any form of a known aircraft. The fireball object continued in the Easterly direction directly over the city of Baton Rouge and then slowly headed South until it disappeared over the horizon.  The object was clearly visible to anyone in Baton Rouge looking up. I noticed that other vehicles traveling on I-12 were reducing their speed as I was perhaps because they were gazing at the object. I had my cell phone with me and attempted to take a picture but was afraid of being involved in an accident.  For the record: This is my fourth experience at witnessing something very unusual in the night sky. The other incidents were the typical bright objects traveling at a huge rate of speed and then sharply changing directions. However, this recent incident is different. I'm very skeptical of it being any U.F.O. because of the flare like objects dropping from it. But it confuses me as the how the object appeared to remain intact, never losing altitude or speed and flying off into the horizon.  One final note: here is a link to a UFO Map where you can other testimonials of people who have witnessed the same object over Baton Rouge.   http://www.ufomaps.com/city/Baton+Rouge   Peter Duffield;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
Fire in the sky;2008-08-09 22:00:00;3 Minutes;Fire in the sky *Aware of the meteor shower, I was outside in my friends front yard facing east and noticed what appeared to be a very large meteorite.  It was inclining at a very slow speed.  After about 30 seconds of it's presence, I ran into the house and got everyone outside to view what I was seeing.  Moments later it started declining, and resembled a plane on fire going down.  It split into 4 pieces which appeared the same size, and the fire disappeared.  You could see dim red lights which led us to believe that an airplane had exploded.  A few seconds later, the remaining pieces flared back up and started weaving in and out of each other in a horizontal fashion.  They slowly dropped towards the skyline, but the whole sighting lasted about 3.5 - 4 minutes.  We all came to the conclusion that it was not an airplane, and from my experience in astronomy, definitely not a meteorite.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
Fire In Sky-- Baton Rouge, LA;2009-08-08 21:15:00;3 to4 min;Fire In Sky-- Baton Rouge, LA Response to below (08/09/09) Baton Rouge, LA  We saw the exact same thing that the post below describes.  At first, I thought it to be a meteor shower/falling fire.  I was turning left in my car and lost sight of the sighting.  I immediately turned my car around in order to track what was going on.  Once visible again, it seemed the objects fell rapidly but quickly aligned.  However, at some point the lights quickly disappeared with one moving quickly to the West.  Don’t believe in UFO’s.  Any rationale explanation out there?

Disappeared then came back going a different direction. Some would dim then fade out. Lights were soli Noticed 5 fireball like objects (red/orange) floating, going the same direction.  The seemed to be heading the same direction at first then would disappear one after another.  Then they came back almost in a linear pattern then became more like a large U, but in a different direction, almost like they were circling around.  Only 4 lights visible this time.  Then the formation changed and they disappeared up to two then none.  There were planes visible going the opposite direction.  The light from these object was very distinct compared to the light of the plane.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
Neon-orange orb light, slowly floating across the sky, until disappearing.;2015-08-28 22:40:00;2 minutes;Neon-orange orb light, slowly floating across the sky, until disappearing. I was walking outside of my apartment complex located on River Road, along the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge.   My friend and me automatically noticed a bright, neon orange light in the sky.  We knew it was not a plane or satellite.   We continued to watch for about 2 minutes as it slowly floated across the sky, eventually getting smaller and smaller until it just disappeared.   There was no sound or trail, just the glowing orb.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
