After a storm, while on the bleechers watching a football game, we noticed a bright long light above some clouds. Because it was so far away it would be too large and too long to be a Blimp. It wouldn't move so it couldn't be a plane...so I took some pictures with my digital camera. Then it just dissapeared. When I got home, I enlarged the immage and it is clearly a cigar shaped allumminum looking thing.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
A stationary, upright cigar shaped object with multiple lights flashing in quick succession.;2014-10-24 01:18:00;1+ hour;A stationary, upright cigar shaped object with multiple lights flashing in quick succession. 120 degrees SE of 30°20'34 N 91°7'60 W   A tall, stationary, upright cigar shaped object that had multiple flashing lights that flashed at quick intervals.  I could not make out a shape, but the object did not seem to move at all and I couldn't find anything on my star viewer app that corresponded to the location of the unidentified object.   I just looked on http://www.radarbox24.com/ to see if there are any current flights in that direction according to the FAA, but the nearest flights are JBU775, between Slidell, LA, and New Orleans, and a BLOCKED flight from Santa Monica coded C25B, which is currently E by SE of Lafayette, LA.  Neither planes are within the visual field where I spotted the UFO.   I made a short video of the object with a point and shoot camera, but the focus was poor.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
Hovering, long object with bright green lights quickly shot off into another direction at a high speed.  ((anonymous report));2018-04-12 05:45:00;15 seconds;Hovering, long object with bright green lights quickly shot off into another direction at a high speed. As I exited the interstate at approximately 5:45am on 4/12/18, I noticed a hovering object with a bright (neon) green light (non-flashing).  It was above the tree line, but lower than you’d typically see an airplane flying.  It slowly started moving and then quickly changed direction and shot off westbound.  It took off at a very high speed and either its lights went off, or it “vanished,” because I couldn’t locate it in the sky after it changed direction.
