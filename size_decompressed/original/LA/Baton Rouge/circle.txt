A giant black orb, looming over Baton rouge.;2002-11-13 01:20:00;10 seconds;A giant black orb, looming over Baton rouge. I pulled into a Burger King. I was about to get out of my car when I saw a big black object in my rearview mirror, at first I thought the mirror had something on it, put when I got out of the car and looked at the sky I saw a big black sphere hovering in mid air. Then, after a moment, it just vanished.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295

Looking up to check the weather/cloud coverage I noticed an odd shape just floating through the sky. I kept staring at it because it was round and pink/orange colored and it just seemed so out of place. I asked my boyfriend if he saw it too but he was standing about 5 feet higher than I was (on the back of a moving truck) so before he could follow my pointing finger it dissapeared in the clouds.It didn't blink/flash and was not anything I have ever seen in the night sky before. Before it vaished in the clouds it seemed to leave a little trail of sparks. It looked very much like the image on the home page, but I wouldn't discribe it as a fireball, because it kept changing colors.(pink/orange) Did anyone else see this thing???;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295

((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been looking at Sirius.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
Unknown round object followed by two jets over Baton Rouge flying northwest at approx 11:00 AM;2011-06-17 10:50:00;45 seconds;Unknown round object followed by two jets over Baton Rouge flying northwest at approx 11:00 AM Near midday, blue sky with scattered clouds.  Single round shiny object with contrail traveling northwest.  Did not observe any lights or erratic behavior. Object maintained steady course and speed. The object was followed by two jets.  The object was slightly wider than the fuselage of the jets. The jets did not leave contrails.  The jets trailed the object flying in formation.  The second jet flew to the right rear of the lead jet.  The jets were not fighters and appeared to be larger.  Possibly the size of large corporate jet. The distance between the first jet and second jet was approx the length of three of the aircraft. The first jet accelerated and caught up with the object.  The second jet remained behind the object and never adjusted speed. The first jet passed the object then decelerated to its original speed.  Clouds briefly obscured the three but they quickly reappeared maintaining the same heading.  All three eventually flew out of sight. I tried to take a picture with my camera phone but have not downloaded the photo and a review the photo on the phone is difficult. My co-worker and I are both former military.  I have flown on a variety of military aircraft in the army and my co-worker was in the navy.  He remarked that the round object displayed no wings or characteristics of known aircraft.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
Round white orbs seen over LSU.;2013-01-15 20:30:00;30 seconds;Round white orbs seen over LSU I was driving on I-10 heading to Gonzales to visit my children when I saw the orbs over the LSU lakes, facing the campus.   I couldn't stop because of the traffic behind me.  The orbs where perfectly round and not moving. They were staggered and in a formation.  They were bright white and not blinking.  That same night, at around 23:00, I went back the same way to see if they were still there, or to see if maybe I could debunk what I saw, but they were gone.  There was nothing that came close to resembling what I had seen.  Is there anyone out there that witnessed what I saw.  It's been over a year and I'm still puzzled.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295

4 disks with red glow seen over LSU going due west on 12/17 at 7:30;2015-12-17 19:50:00;1 minute;4 disks with red glow seen over LSU going due west on 12/17 at 7:30 At 7:30 pm on the 17th, I was in the back yard of my home just outside of the LSU campus.  I looked straight up, and rite away, saw 4 circle disks in formation moving due west.  They had an orange red glow that was faint and covered each disk entirely.  If you drew a circle around the formation, it was aprox. the size of the moon.   As they moved, the formation changed with 2 crossing over to the other side of the other 2. There was plenty of normal air traffic in the distance, all with typical blinking lights.  These did not blink.  The low glow to them came from the entire disk looking almost organic.  They were smooth moving and made no sound.  Fading out a minute later again heading due west over the Mississippi river.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
Large black “balloon” spotted over Baton Rouge, LA, USA;2020-01-21 16:54:00;10 minutes;Large black “balloon” spotted over Baton Rouge, LA, USA I saw a large black object in the sky while driving home from work.  I tried to watch it as it hovered, trying to peer and see if it could’ve been a hot air balloon, so I took a picture zoomed in as much as I could so I could look at it when I got home.  I didn’t see a basket below the object.  I looked up weather balloons, and it didn’t look like that. It moved very slowly and was in the process of descending when I saw it.  I was driving east on I-12 in Baton Rouge.  I only saw one large roundish black object at 4:54 PM on 01/21/2020.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
lights, orbs, spaceships, and drones all following me for months;2020-12-01 20:00:00;all night;lights, orbs, spaceships, and drones all following me for months Hello I have been experiencing strange phenomenon since last year. I thought it was spiritual and I even had a paranormal investigation. Lights have followed me for months and I thought it was spirits. I have hours of videos of weird spacecrafts I will release whatever you need. They have now started flying over me while I drive everywhere I go. I am very worried. I have a link I can send with over 100 videos and that isn't even scratching the surface. Please let me know what I should do. The objects are round lights that start small and disguise as stars. when they approach they grow in size. There is 4 or 5 different crafts I have seen. some very large some small like drones. There are two lights that always follow me and I believe they are a ship that is disguised as stars. The crafts in the videos seem round and some seem square and flat.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
