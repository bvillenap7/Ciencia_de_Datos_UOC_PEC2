I left my apartment to go to the laundry room. I was walking and turned the corner, and there was 3 illuminated orange triangles, flying in formation.  One in the front and two on the rear, forming like a triangle. But they were 3 seperate triangles.  I noticed them quickly, because they were so low to the ground. About two of the apartments stacked high. 50 feet up (or low).  They moved slowly and silently towards a church between the two buildings I was standing between. They slowly turned around and slowly came back towards me (with my mouth wide open) and then they slowly got higher and then they shot off and disappeared.  They had to be traveling at the speed of light. 45 minutes after the one of the wildest things I've ever experienced I went back outside and I saw 3 small engine planes flying around the area(within 2 miles). I don't know if somebody else saw but someone had to have.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295

Two were smaller with 3 lights each,1 larger craft with a circle of lights in the center. The two smaller crafts were to the westside,one ahead and one behind, the larger craft. They were moving very fast,with no sound, and no flashing lights. All the lights were dim and white. The lights that made-up the circle on the larger craft had a little blue tint to them,there were about 5 lights to the circle.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295

A V shaped object with 5-6 lights running on either side and a solid mass in the middle flying over Baton Rouge on September 6, 2008.;2008-09-06 22:00:00;1 min;A V shaped object with 5-6 lights running on either side and a solid mass in the middle flying over Baton Rouge on September 6, 2008. I was staying with my friend’s house in Baton Rouge, because they were lucky enough to have their electricity restored after hurricane Gustav. I was standing out front of my friends house, for a smoke break, around 10:00 p.m. or 10:30 p.m. (I am not sure of the exact time). It was a very quiet night due to the fact that after hurricane Gustav most of the city doesn’t have power and also we had a curfew that no one should be driving or out cruising starting at 8:00 p.m. The only sound you could hear were the sounds of generators in use. So, the sky was clear, stars visible, but dark, that eerie dark without the glow of street lights and house lights. I was looking up when I noticed out in the distance what looked like a flock of white birds, in a V formation heading my direction. It caught my attention for how white the birds were. But as they were flying overhead to where I got a better look, I realized they were not birds but rather something I don’t know how to explain. It was a V formation but it was, not necessarily lights spread apart but more like a reflective surface? If it were lights they would just have to be very dim I suppose. Not anything so bright that would have made it stand out in the dark sky. It was probably 1000 ft up, but honestly I could not gauge the distance because I was still trying to figure out what it was I was looking at. Also, noticed that it was a solid mass between the lights. It moved at a good pace and made absolutely no sound. After it flew over me and crossed over the neighbor’s house it was gone.  I don’t know what I saw but I know it wasn’t an airplane or a helicopter. I do not wish to speak to anyone or have my name or information published. I am curious to know if there were any stealth bombers flying over but wish to remain anonymous. I am not crazy and not on drugs, just wanted to pass this information on in case it is useful or important to your research. And am hoping I am not the only person to have seen something strange over the skies of Baton Rouge that night.  I am providing my email address if you need confirmation of my account.  Thank you.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295

The balls appeared, dissapeared, reappeared and so on as the two triagles moved across the sky at a speed of probably 50mph.  Each ball seemed about a hundred yards apart.  Each triangle was several hundred yards high.  The height did not appear to change as the triangles traveled across the sky in a NE direction.  Of note, a college football game (lsu vs south carolina) is going on, 5 miles away, with the stadium lighing the night sky. There is a blimp above the stadium.

At some point, the red lights which were on the outside if the triangle would disappear and the blue lights which were in the middle were visible then you would  see the green, then the red would appear again with the blue and then green.   Not sure what it was but is was dark and it was high enough in the sky I couldn't tell.;30.4287277955271;-91.0997691693295
