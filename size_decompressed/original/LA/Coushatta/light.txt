two orange lights in the stars;1997-06-03 23:00:00;10 minutes;two orange lights in the stars the objects were small orange lights. there were two of them seemed like they were within the stars. i live were there are no lights so i can observe the sky without light polution. i was watching satelites go by then something cought my eyes. i saw a small orange object, seemed higher than the satellites. it was moving very slowly then all the sudden the other one, same size and color, just shot after this other object and they both just shot around the sky playing with each other, like a dog fight between two jets but these objects would do a 180 and never slowed. they turned a 90 degree angle just like that. they were going at each other, dodging  but this was so far away i never had to move my eyes to watch them. since i was 5 years old i have been watching the sky and this is a first for me. ive done some investgating and there is nothing i can think they could be but other craft not from this world. i kind of scared me because i was acually witnessing something different. i wish i could find someone who has seen something like this. about 10 minutes later one just shot off so fast it just disapered and the other one went off at a slower speed and then disapered halfway across the sky. i just layed there and they never came back. ive been looking and havent seen them yet but hoping to witness the same thing this time with a camera.
