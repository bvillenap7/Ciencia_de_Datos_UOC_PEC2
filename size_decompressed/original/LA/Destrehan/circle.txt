I rubbed my eyes because I was seeing things then I watched what I counted as 10 of them fly like bees in and out of the clouds.  Slowly I saw one come out of the clouds that was bigger.  Seems the smaller ones were circling the larger ones.  By this time I was laying on the back side of the levy.  They were not jets, and were thousands of feet up going back n forth and round in immediate changes of direction.  I was in disbelief.  Lasted about 5 minutes or so then the big one took off so fast it looked like a shooting black star across the sky and disappears.  The other small ones one by one went just as fast in the same direction.   I have never seen this again and have not stopped looking in the sky's for them and I am now 42...I was 17 then. Never told anyone but my mom and wife but both don't believe me.  This happened and I will die with this experience and the knowledge that there is another being here with us or watching.;29.9605;-90.3629
