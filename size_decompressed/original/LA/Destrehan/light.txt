I came home about 10 pm.  It was a clear night. I went to our roadside mailbox to check for mail.  I looked up and saw a slow moving reddish light moving west to east in the southern sky. As I tracked the light visually, it all of a sudden split into two smaller lights of the same color and intensity. No tails were noted. These two smaller lights then travelled in different directions. I am a registered nurse. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));29.9605;-90.3629
