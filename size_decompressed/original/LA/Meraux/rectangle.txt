Rectangular shaped flying Huge box kite looking thing (about 15 ft across);2000-04-15 22:00:00;about 1 minute;Rectangular shaped flying Huge box kite looking thing (about 15 ft across) I was laying on my back in my backyard looking up.  Silently, coming right over the roof of my house this dark, almost black looking rectangle shaped object, resembling a chinese box kite about 15 feet across and maybe 4 feet thick, passed directly over my head.  It was hard to see if you didn't know it was there. It was very low just above the power lines and trees.  It made no sound what so ever.  I was trying to figure out what it was.  I had never seen anything like it.  When it was about 40 ft passed me, it turned down the street next to mine keeping one corner fixed then just turned the corner kind of the way a marching band makes a turn.  I watched it as it went away and then the weirdest thing happened.  I saw a very dark, deep, blood red, hard to see light seemed to glow from the back.  It appeared to change shape because the red glow went from being across the whole back to being like on the two ends of the top of a T or V and one being at about the base of a T or V.  I could not tell if it changed shape or split in three seperate things.  Weird.  It then went behind some tall trees and I never saw it or anything like it again. I have just read some reports online that were similar and it blew me away.  I have asked people for 5 years if they ever saw anything like it and they think I am nuts.  It was the same color as the night sky and was so close to my house.  I can't help but think it is some sort of spy plane.  It did not look like something from out of this world, just weird and like nothing I have ever encountered in my life.  I would love to see a photo or drawing of what others have seen and see if it is the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));29.9363;-89.9228
