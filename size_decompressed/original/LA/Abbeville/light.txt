BRIGHT LIGHTS IN SKY.;2013-12-10 18:00:00;20-30 minutes;BRIGHT LIGHTS IN SKY I was driving down the road and something caught my eye and i looked up in the sky and there was two things with lights all around them.  One looked smaller and was off to in the distance and one was bigger and a little lower then the other.  I knew it wasnt a plane or helicopter because when you see those they are moving.  These objects weren't moving. They had lights all around them, very bright lights.  I looked away for a split second and the little one was gone but the big was was still there.  I was so amazed i even pulled over on the side of the road and looked behind me and there was 1 more car pulled over looking and another pulling over looking at the same object as me.
