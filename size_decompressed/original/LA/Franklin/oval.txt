I got to the stand early and it was still very dark.  The sky was filled with stars.  I observed a light moving west to east across the sky.  My first thoughts was that it was a high flying plane but I realized it was moving much to fast for a plane that high up.  It also did not display any flashing lights which is common when you see a plane at night.  I picked up my 10x50 binoculars and focused in on the object and was surprised to see that it appeared to be a clear orb with white lights encircling the whole edge of the object.  The lights did not flash and I observed no colored or flashing lights of any kind on the object.  It disappeared in about 3 minutes.
