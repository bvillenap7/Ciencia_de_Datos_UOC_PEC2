Walked out of the house.  Looked in the sky and saw one huge object with about 6 green circular lights and a centered red light above the green lights.  The green lights were so pretty.  The object was traveling northeast.  I saw the object from the back. In about seconds the object seem like it was 10 miles away.  I saw it make a sharp left turn at a slow pace then gradually speed up and instantly came to a stop.  The object did not tilt while turning.  Then made a super fast right turn at an alarming speed not seen before and fell down.  It popped back up, took off, then disappeared before my eyes;29.7821;-91.504
