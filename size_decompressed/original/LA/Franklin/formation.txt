Lights of large object over Franklin, Louisiana.;2014-10-16 20:00:00;5 minutes;Lights of large object over Franklin, Louisiana. Two lights perpendicular to each other in the shape of a colon move from the horizon in a 45 degree angle towards the sky followed by another set and another completely synchronized with each other.  I'm not an irrational person I immediately took into consideration possible explanationshowever what I couldn't explain was that the top row of lights never moved out of alignment with the bottom it remained in the shape of a colon signifying a solid object the lights came in sets distanced a few seconds apart until there were roughly twenty to thirty pairs of lights moving perfectly in sync with one another like the world's largest plane taking off from too sharp of an angle not one light dimmed or strayed from the shape it kept structure until it moved into the zenith and was no longer visible.
