My family saw 15-20 UFOs that appeared as lights for 3 consecutive nights.;2001-01-30 22:00:00;3 nights (at least);My family saw 15-20 UFOs that appeared as lights for 3 consecutive nights. My husband saw them first then asked me to come out to see.  We saw objects very high in the sky near the constellation Orion.  We went out to look every so often between 9:00pm and 10:30pm.  They were there the whole time.  The UFOs were brighter and seemed to be closer than the stars in Orion. At first they seemed to be stars but when we took time to look at them we could see there were two lights very close together.  Every 10-30 seconds (approx. it varried) a sparkling light would shoot out from each craft. They remained mostly stationary but we occaisionaly saw one move  a short distance, suddenly. The second night, we saw them again in about the same places.  We invited our 19 year old son out to see them. One seemed larger, brighter, (we assumed it was closer) but the second night everything was about the same as the first night.  Tonight, 2/1/01, the third night, there were clouds early in the evening but some of them (5-6) were still visible, even though Orion was not visible.  The one that seem closer than the others was now even closer.  Later in the evening, 10:00pm the sky cleared.  At that time the one that had been close was gone and only 4 remained. My husband and I are educated and our son is in college, we are a stable, Christian, family.  My husband works for a department store and I work in a college library. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with these witnesses, and they seemed quite sincere.  We believe they may have been looking at bright planets, or twinkling stars, but we are not certain.  That would not explain the number of objects they allegedly witnessed, and it would not explain the objects that allegedly were reportedly ejected from the lights.

It has bright lights that move in a zig zag, up and down, and around type movement.  Its position is to the left of the Big Dipper handle.   It has been in the same area for more than 2 hours now.
