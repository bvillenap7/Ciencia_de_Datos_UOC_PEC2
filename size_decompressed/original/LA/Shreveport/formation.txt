There were many trucks in the lot, so it is possible it was more than just he and I who saw the lights. His coordinates were appx 32.380257,-93.659467 (Google maps) looking out to field to the east, slightly north towards the bend in the Red River between the industrial area and Taylortown (seen in Google maps screen shot). He flipped his video around to back camera and showed me a formation of lights (seen in second screenshot)  There looked to be 5-6 lights which ran in slightly staggering line about 3 finger widths up from horizon (from his distance).  They say each finger width is appx 15 min each when measuring time before sun goes down, do however high up that would be. He stated that they were just hovering for quite some time, but began to move very slowly to what appeared to him to be to the south/southeast.  He listened for helicopter noises, but heard nothing of the sort.;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752
