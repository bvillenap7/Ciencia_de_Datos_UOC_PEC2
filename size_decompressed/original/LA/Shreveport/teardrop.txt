A green light in the sky...;2007-06-13 22:00:00;a few seconds;A green light in the sky... I am a 31 year old father of 2. I was outside smoking a cigarette. I happen to gaze up in the sky towards my neighbors house when I saw a bright, neon green light shoot across the sky at a rapid rate. My first thought was that it may have been a spotlight because we have casinos near by. I noticed that there was no light trail to the ground and that the object seemed to be BEHIND the thin layer of clouds. I looked for it to loop back in case it was a spotlight, but nothing ever came. I stayed out looking for it to come back or ANYTHING, but nothing ever came. There was NO NOISE to suggest it was a plane or any type of aircraft. It flew in the general direction of the air force base.;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752
Grey teardrop shaped craft spotted above I-49.;2015-09-13 17:45:00;20 seconds;Grey teardrop shaped craft spotted above I-49. Driving on Interstate 49 a few miles before the Southern Loop exit along the furthest outskirts of the city, a flat grey craft shaped like a teardrop hovered about 75 feet above treeline approximately ~1 mile from our vehicle.   Object remained in sightline for several seconds before either disappearing behind the horizon OR descend into forest.  Was not spotted again despite traveling in same direction.;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752
