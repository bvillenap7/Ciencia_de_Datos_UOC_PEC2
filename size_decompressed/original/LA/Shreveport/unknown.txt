I WAS DRIVING HOME ONE NIGHT FROM FEEDING MY HORSE WHEN I LOOKED UP AND SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A LARGE PLANE FLYING ABOVE THE TREES.  I COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING BUT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS LITTLE OBJECT ABOUT ONE-FOURTH THE SIZE OF THE PLANE CAME FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AND STARTED ROTATING AROUND THE PLANE.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT THEY WERE FIGHTER JETS FROM BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE, BUT NOTHING COULD HAVE ORBITED LIKE THAT OBJECT DID.  WHEN I GOT HOME MY FATHER WAS OUTSIDE AND I TOLD HIM WHAT I SAW AND HE SAID HE SAW IT TOO.  HE IS A VERY INTELLIGENT MAN AND WAS IN THE SEVICE FOR A LONG TIME.  HE TOLD ME HE HAS NEVER SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE.;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752
2 different objects seen in Louisiana;2006-10-03 19:30:00;6-8 minutes;2 different objects seen in Louisiana I actually saw 2 separate objects this night. They were actually at 2 different times. Also I need to point out that I live close to an air force base. There are times when I've seen obvious unknown military planes and one would suspect these as being UFOs. As we all know, not everything seen can be said to be from another planet.  The first object i saw was in the middle of a large amount of air traffic. I was in the backyard taking my dog out and happened to noticed how much air traffic was flying over. There are several distinctive paths where the airlines fly and over the years I've come to know where in they sky they usually are. There was plane after plane. Probably about 5 minutes apart in sightings. All of a sudden there was this one object that came across the sky in a totally odd flight path. It had lighting like what you see when several windows of a commercial plane is glowing. There was probably 8 double windows down the side. It sort of had a banana shape to it actually. There were no other lights. No red blinking light underneath. No landing geat lights either. Just these lights. It seemed to hold some reflection from the ground as there was a slight glow. Not a glow as if it were from the object, but just reflected up from the ground. It didn't really have a feel that it was flying straight either. I got a sense of a tumbling while watching it. It went over in an S shape too. It came from the north flying southwest, then southeast, then back southwest. It was wide curves and not sudden direction changes. I couldn't say there was no sound either as there was still many other planes flying over.  The second object came a few hours later. I decided to go back out to see if I could see something else. Just something you do I guess when you see an object like that. Sort of a hope that you see it again I guess. As I was looking up I noticed a star out of place straight over head. I know the constellations pretty well so I knew this light shouldn't be there. About that time I noticed it was actually moving. It was really slow. Iwas traveling from the west heading East. It's the path that I generally see satellites when they are illuminated by the sun. I had thought that's what this was too, but it was moving so slow I felt that was worth ruling out. It kept travling the same path and became dimmer and dimmer as it move toward the Earth's shadow. It was just like a satellite in everyway, just extremely slow. The complete time of seeing this object would be around 12 - 15 minutes.  Both of these object could easily have other explainations rather than UFO. They are UFOs though in the sense that I had no clue what they were. I don't think any other regular average person could have said either. But I thought this was worth reporting. I would have sent info in sooner but I had teken pictures of the first object and was trying to get something to show up. I used a digital camera and had the settings wrong. All I got was a blurry dim light in one photo and nothing in the others. I tried to increase the brightness and played with the contrast but was unable to get a shape. There wasn't anything worth sending with this report.;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752

Craft with 2 large colorful light like orbs. changing from array of different colors as it flew by at an incredibly fast speed;2015-09-19 20:00:00;10 seconds;Craft with 2 large colorful light like orbs. changing from array of different colors as it flew by at an incredibly fast speed In my back yard about 8:00 pm.  Watching all the stars start to come out with my daughter.  And a very fast, colorful, and silent object was flying low over what looked like my roof top.  I got my phone and started to take pictures.   It was moving so fast it was hard to get a clear picture.  But a few turned out.   We know it wasn't a helicopter or plane because there was absolutely no noise.  It was traveling in an up and down like manner.   We watched it fly away into the horizon, then it just disappeared suddenly;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752
