Mandolin shaped soundless craft, with colored lights on belly, and red sequence lights on side, two white light on front.;2010-04-08 22:00:00;ten minutes;Mandolin shaped soundless craft, with colored lights on belly, and red sequence lights on side, two white light on front. Craft well above tree line on left of highway 71, approaching our vehicle.  Appeared as two bright white lights.  As it neared vehicle and crossed in front and above it had a line of red lights flasing in sequence in a row. Craft crossed to left of road and hovered well above our vehicle above pasture ground.  Higher than a radio tower.  Shape of craft vaguely mandolin. Small Greenish blue light on belly, also red light on belly. A number of white lights, also rather small interspersed.  I would estimate no more than 6.  Craft made no noise and seemed to drift slowly in air.  Another car following behind us in the night must have also seen it, as we slowed down and so did the car following, which appeared to drop way back to study the UFO.

Boomerang object spotted;2014-05-06 22:15:00;10 seconds;Boomerang object spotted me and my fianc√© where in our front yard gazing at the half moon, I then spotted something move. thought it was the clouds, but it was moving fast.  I pointed at it to her to witness also, we both watched carefully.  The object made no noise and was huge.  The color was almost clear and parts of it was white.  It was in the shape on a boomerang. and for it to go across the sky to a disappearing point, took about 10 seconds.  I personally thought it was a person hand ((sic.  Hang.)) gliding.  But nah!!!  We both agree it was not.;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752
