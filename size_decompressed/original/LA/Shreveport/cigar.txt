There was a slight aura surrounding it. It appeared narrower on the ends than in the middle. It appeared to be vertical. There were 2 dim flashes of light to the upper right side of the object. The object then made a very quick, sporadic movement down to the left side and appeared to have turned horizontally. It held a steady position, with the entire object continuing to glow intensely. After about 10 min, it vanished completely.;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752
