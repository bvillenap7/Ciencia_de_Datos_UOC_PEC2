large triangle thing over Shreveport;2003-07-21 21:30:00;1 minute;large triangle thing over Shreveport I was driving home after picking up a pizza and while going down the road I thought I saw some kind of helicopter or maybe a few of them infront of me in the sky.  I thought they looked strange because their lights were so dim.  After I looked a little more closely I realized it was just one large craft.  It was triangular with rounded edges and it had really dim lights going around it, maybe 10 to 15 of them. They weren't blinking or changing at all.  The appeared to be pretty large and far away and it moved lateraly very easily.;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752
Something out of the ordinary..looked like a flying constellation to me..but not to him...;2004-11-08 09:20:00;one minute;Something out of the ordinary..looked like a flying constellation to me..but not to him... Two people both saw this UFO yet both say it looked different.  Both agree that it flew in a swift horizontal line across the sky.  One person described it as a flying constellation int he form of a triangle...the other said he saw no lights resembling a constellatiion but more like a dark mass shaped like a cigar.  Both saw this shape in the same direction at the same time.  It flew slow enough to see it yet fast enough to determine that it was something out of the ordinary.  Once it went behind a tree it was too difficult to find it in the sky agin because of it's ability to blend in with the sky.;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752
Flying Triangle craft observed over Shreveport, Louisiana, on night of 27 May 2015.;2015-05-27 22:15:00;00:05;Flying Triangle craft observed over Shreveport, Louisiana, on night of 27 May 2015. Shreveport, Louisiana, around 10:15 pm CDT  Duration of sighting:  5 minutes  Angle of view: 45 degrees above horizon  Estimated altitude of craft: 5,000 ft gal  Estimated speed of craft: 50 mph  A triangle shaped craft was observed flying slowly and silently over Shreveport on a northerly heading, most likely flying directly over Interstate 49 which is a north-south highway in the city. I was observing from a distance of one (1) mile east of Interstate 49 with a clear field of view, in the southeast section of the city.  Weather conditions were clear and calm. At arms length, the craft appeared to be the same size as the width of my thumb, which is an average-sized adult male thumb. I was also able to view the craft using a high-quality pair of 10x50 binoculars that gave an enlarged and more detailed view. I could not discern any distinct structure, but did observe that background stars disappeared from view as the craft passed in front of them. The shape of the craft was an elongated deltoid triangle with a single blinking red light centered underneath, and non-blinking white lights on each of the three corners. There was no green light, which is normally required on the right wingtip of all aircraft. With the binoculars, a row of three dimmer non-blinking yellowish lights could be seen along the starboard leading edge of the craft just aft of the most forward non-blink white light. I surmise that these were windows. I observed the craft as it continued to fly north of the city until if became obscured by trees on the horizon in the distance. The speed and altitude seemed to remain constant during my observation. There was no audible sound at any time. This is the sixth time in the past year that I have observed such a craft flying over my city at night, and it has always been seen in this same way, in the same place, flying in the same manner and direction. The next time I see this craft I will be prepared with my Nikon DSLR and f/1.8 lens along with my Panasonic PV-GS300 low-light capable miniDV camcorder. I am a lifelong aviation enthusiast and airplane spotter and am certain that this was not a conventional aircraft. I would welcome a reply, but am not requesting one.;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752
White / Orange Orbs In Triangle Formation Shreveport, La;2019-07-31 21:00:00;1 hour;White / Orange Orbs In Triangle Formation Shreveport, La UFO Sighting -  Date - July 31, 2019  Time - 8-9pm CST hour  Location - Shreveport, Louisiana  # Of Sightings Experienced - 1, second hand  # of Persons Involved / Witnesses (number of those present, not their names) - Two (brother, neighbor)  Description of events leading to, during and post sighting - Asked my brother on 8/1 if he'd ever seen a UFO and he laughed and said Last night and that he'd gotten a photo of it on his phone.  He explained that it was three lights in the sky.  I interjected, triangle shaped? and he nodded, agreeing. He said he and his friend (a neighbor at the end of the drive) were outside talking last night and saw this formation of three lights. The neighbor is the one who'd taken the photo with his cellphone (don't know what kind). It remained in place for awhile and then vanished.    Neighbor forwarded the photo to my brother's phone and it was accidentally deleted. He texted the neighbor with my number and asked if he'd forward the photo to me. Neighbor did so. Description of UFO/UAP - Three bright white orb lights or glowing orbs hovering not too high over the condos across from neighbor's.  Remained in the sky for an unknown amount of time before they noticed it.  Vanished = one second it was there, the next it wasn't.     No further details.
