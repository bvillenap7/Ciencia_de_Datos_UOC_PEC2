Initially the craft were in a triangle formation facing northand still.  They changed formation and moved to the south and one was very visible with the other two farther up in the sky.  The saucer ring in the middle had a greenish hue.   We have never experienced anything like this and I can honestly say 'freaked out, if you will.   My dogs are acting very scared and worried.;32.4651425655976;-93.7727772594752

My son witnessed a saucer shaped object flying in the sky in a horizontal line, somewhat slowly at first, then quickly speeding off and disappearing.  It appeared to be high in the sky, but large, and clearly a saucer shaped craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
