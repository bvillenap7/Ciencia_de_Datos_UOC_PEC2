Some type of craft of light speed.;2014-03-16 07:00:00;<5 seconds;some type of craft of light speed. I'm a professional truck driver I was coming through at the state line of Louisiana on the eastbound side of interstate 20 as I look to the right Southside around exit 8 I seen the wind speed of light coming from the ground within seconds to disappear into the clouds  I am un aware of what this was but it was not of one of our aircraft  it was 7 a.m.   The light that it was producing bright white light looks almost like a year or bright star coming from the ground up into the sky almost as fast does a bullet  I reported it to 911  they said that they were going to do.
