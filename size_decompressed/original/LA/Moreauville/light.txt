Possible UFO in Moreauville, LA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from police office, who also is amateur astronomer.  PD));2011-06-18 23:15:00;8-10 seconds;Possible UFO in Moreauville, LA On the above date and time, I was on patrol and had my patrol unit parked facing Northeast just off of LA-451.  According to my hand-held G.P.S., my exact unit coordinates were North 31 degrees 02.972', West 91 degrees 58.536'.   At that time through my windshield I observed a steady yellow light in the sky at about the height of an airliner. The exact distance from me is unknown.  The light was traveling south. As I continued watching the light, it began to fade.  At that time I assumed it was an airplane with its landing lights being turned off, so I continued to observe the object awaiting the wing lights to start blinking.   Object faded to an extent to where I could no longer see it with my naked eye.   I immediately grabbed by binoculars and exited my unit for a better few.  I was able to quickly focus in on the object and at that time, object faded completely.  I scanned the sky attempted to locate the object again but object never re-appeared.   During the sighting, I noticed an airliner in the vicinity traveling East, but was a good distance from the object.   On my time off, I am a novice astronomer and I know for a fact this object was not a meteoroid due to its constant speed and slow dimming light.;31.1021;-91.877
