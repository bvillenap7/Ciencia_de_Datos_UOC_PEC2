Crazy UFOs moving in circular and zig-zagging formations, very fast!;2008-03-21 01:15:00;around an hour;Crazy UFOs moving in circular and zig-zagging formations, very fast! Me and a few friends decided to visit my family's new house in the country of north Louisiana. The house wasn't completely finished internally, but there was a pool table so we did have a pastime. The time we arrived was somewhere around 9:00pm-10:00pm.  As the night progressed I became bored and decided to get some fresh air outside.  The sky was very clear that night so the stars were very visible.  I looked upward and saw the strangest thing I have ever seen in my life.  A bright blue light was in the sky and at that moment it started moving at a speed that reminded me of how fast a satellite falls when it falls out of orbit. Then all of a sudden it just stopped completely. Although it was far in distance away, it was plainfully seen as a UFO right above the treeline. It started moving in circles and flashing strobe with colors that can be compared to a rave. It also seemed to be shining light from its belly towards the ground..maybe a beam? It was that moment that we noticed there was another one of these things in the sky a short distance away in width, but this one was a farther distance away.  They continued zig-zagging and moving in a circular formation for around an hour and disappeared. It looked as though one may have landed. What we saw cannot be explained. I do know that no aircraft in this world could do what was seen. Since then a friend and I have seen crazy things in the same vicinity. It feels awkward to tell people when they think your crazy.;32.5088036585366;-92.1794219512196
