bright orbs of light in the sky;2010-04-08 00:00:00;1 hour;bright orbs of light in the sky At first I thought it was a bright star then I notised it was flickering red, green and white.  I was it two nights in a row.  First night it was just one hovering low in the sky lasting for about an hour.  The next night (tonight) I saw it again at a different location and a second one appeared about an hour after the first one was hovering.  The second one was parallel to the other and brighter and flickered red and blue like a firecracker.  When the other appeared the other faded away and then the second one flew over my head slowly with out any sound just flickering red and blue and white slowly flying into the distance.;32.5088036585366;-92.1794219512196
Bright red orange fireball on July 6th at 9 pm;2012-07-06 21:00:00;2 minutes;Bright red orange fireball on July 6th at 9pm My husband, me and our 2 neighbors were standing outside talking after 9pm.  I saw an red orange glow from behind them as we were talking. It got closer and I mentioned it.  We watched it as it went over us.  It made no sound and was moving fast. It went on out of site.  It had come from the south and moved toward north.  We talked about what it was or could be.  A few minutes later, another one came from the same direction.  It only showed for a few seconds then it just completely disappeared. Both looked to be about a mile high. Just a bright red orange ball as it moved.  Like a fire ball.;32.5088036585366;-92.1794219512196
