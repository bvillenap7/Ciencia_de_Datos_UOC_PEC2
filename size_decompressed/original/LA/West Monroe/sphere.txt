Whil on the way home My daughter and I saw something;2009-01-31 13:00:00;2-3 min;Whil on the way home My daughter and I saw something Sat 1/31/09  1 to 2 PM. Location ,West Monroe,Louisiana  While driving North on Hwy 34 entering West Monroe,La.  I noticed an object in the sky to the west of me hovering for a few minutes .I could not tell if it was an airplane or a helicoptor it was just too far away. About another mile up the road at a redlight I noticed it was still in the same position.I pointed it out jokingly to my daughter theres a ufo!,figuring it was just a plane or helicoptor. I watched it out of my window on and off for about another mile or two  This is where it gets interesting, After passing the Red Roof Inn on Thomas Road I looked again and it was still there. I looked at traffic, proceded through the red light on the south side of the Thomas Road I-20 overpass, (distance of about 300 yards to the top of the overpass) and thought I was going to get a good look at the object but it was totally gone!!  I pointed this out to my daughter and she was shocked that it was gone to!  I have no idea what the object was, it was not flashing lights of any kind it did not leave an exhaust trail and it did not seem to move and was only visible to me for a maximum of 2 to 3 minutes .There is absolutly no way an airplane could have moved from the last position, to not being able to be seen ,a distance of 300 yards drivin from a stop light!!  I hope my daughter and I are not the only ones to report this. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));32.5088036585366;-92.1794219512196
