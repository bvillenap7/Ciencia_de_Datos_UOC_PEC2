White cigar shaped object with one pointed end seen in the early afternoon.;2015-07-24 14:00:00;5 minutes;White, cigar shaped object with one pointed end seen in the early afternoon. While walking home across the street from a neighbor’s house, my wife saw a white cigar-shaped (with one pointed end) object up in the sky to the south.  She watched it for a few minutes.  She said it looked like a jet with no wings or exhaust moving rather slowly (but it wasn’t a balloon).   I called the sheriff department, but no other sightings were reported.   We are sharing this story in case there are other sightings of a similar object.;31.5826;-93.4612
