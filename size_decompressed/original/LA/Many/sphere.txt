Metallic sphere with smoke/steam tail, very bright.;2004-06-18 17:20:00;5 minutes+;Metallic sphere with smoke/steam tail, very bright. Driving down Hwy 171, North, my son and I saw an object that was very bright, going through the sky.  It had a tail of smoke/steam, not like a jet that leaves a trail, it followed it like ait was attached.  It appeared to be on fire and when the sun hit it, it was VERY bright, like metal.  We watched it for several miles and then it disappeared behind the clouds.  It was traveling downward.  I assume it was a satellite or something of that nature.;31.5826;-93.4612
