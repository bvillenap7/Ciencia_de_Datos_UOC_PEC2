flying light similar to venus, but venus does not move );2005-09-20 07:30:00;one minute;flying light similar to venus, but venus does not move ) I look at the stars all the time, im somewhat of an expert, not to brag, anyway. i look up to a bright light that i have seen once before outside of the city limits, but this was at my house right before you get into town. i look up and see this bright light looked similar to venus moving downward verry verry slowly and moving side to side, but just barely, i watched it untill it fell below the tree line. the event in which i saw this light before was verry different, it moved over head then back to us lowered down, we looked away for a second and it was gone. this light does not blink at all it moves with grace unlike anything that i have knowledge of.;31.5826;-93.4612
