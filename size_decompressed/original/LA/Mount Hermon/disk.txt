As soon as we got out onto hwy 38 we noticed about 4 disc shaped craft with multi colored lights above us and spread out from each other.  As we continued to drive other craft appeared to phase in equaling around 8 craft total eventually forming a sort of semicircular configuration.  They were fairly spread out.  As we were watching the craft a separate triangle craft with multicolored lights flew low underneath the others.  There was no sound from any of the craft.;30.955;-90.2729
