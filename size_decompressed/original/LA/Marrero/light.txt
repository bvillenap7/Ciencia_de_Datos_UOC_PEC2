Two Blue Lights/ Unidentified Flying Objects seen in the sky over Marrero, LA.;2014-01-04 18:00:00;30-45 minutes;Two Blue Lights/ Unidentified Flying Objects seen in the sky over Marrero, LA My husband called me on the phone around 6:10 pm and stated that he was observing two blue lights in the sky.  It was dark at this time.  He said he was driving towards the City of Westwego and was in the City of Marrero at the time.  He was so startled he stopped the van and got out to look at what he was seeing.  He said the objects seemed to be following each other as they were going in circles, going straight up into the sky and then down, they also were traveling at a very fast speed and seemed to be traveling from Westwego to almost where I lived which is in Terrytown, La.  I immediately went outside to see if I could see anything but didn't have a good view of the sky because of trees and other houses in my way.  He was on the phone with me for almost 45 minutes telling me about what he was seeing.;29.8639;-90.1066999999999
