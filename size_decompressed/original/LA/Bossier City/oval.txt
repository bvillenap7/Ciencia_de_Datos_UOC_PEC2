3 Bright oval objects observed by at least 4 witnesses in NW Louisiana.;2002-02-20 20:00:00;20 minutes;3 Bright oval objects observed by at least 4 witnesses in NW Louisiana. Riding home to S. Bossier, Husband and I noticed 3 very bright oval lights in stair-step formation, each one a slight distance above the other and were stationary at the time. The light from these 3 objects was very bright white and slightly pulsating. We passed a young man out on the main road in front of his house observing these objects as well and pointing. A truck on a side street nearby pulled over. We pulled over farther down the road to observe. The objects were about the size of a green pea held at arms length. No sound evident at all. We watched these 3 objects for about 10 minutes when 2 seemed to blink out and disapppear. We started our truck and headed for home and the 3rd object passed directly over us at a very low rate of speed, N. Easterly heading, no sound, bright white oval shape but upon close observation, could see band of red/green lights around center of object. A second object appeared and seemed to be a companion but was higher in altitude and appeared to be a triangle shape with white, blue, and green lights. The oval object may have been around 3,000 feet in altitude...hard to discern at night. No sound from either objects. ((name deleted));32.5264268041237;-93.6944030927836
Very loud, noisy craft, intense orange-red color, goes over my house in early a.m.;2005-10-12 01:15:00;30 seconds;Very loud, noisy craft, intense orange-red color, goes over my house in early a.m. Was having a fitful night of sleeping and was awakened to a very loud roaring sound.  I could hear the sound coming from a very great distance and kept listening.  I soon realized that the sound was way too loud and taking way too long to advance over my area/house.  It was so loud, the rumbling/roaring seemed to be re-verberating...could swear I could feel vibration of the house/ground relevant to the approaching noise.  By the time I decided to get up and go from the one end of the house to the other, where the back door/deck was located, for the best view of the sky, I was able to just get a good glimpse of whatever it was going over the tall trees in our woods, on a Northeasterly heading.  It was a very intense, bright orange-red color and about the size of a dime held at arms length...though more oval in shape.  I could hear the craft for about 30 seconds more or so, as it was leaving the area.  The noise was most unusual and disconcerting.  The woods animals reacted vigorously with howls and screeches and such.  Some dogs reacted as well, with barking.  Feeling very unsettled now since the incident/sighting.
