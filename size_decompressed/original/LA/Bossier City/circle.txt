When I was looking I saw a bright circular item stationary looking towards the the north west sky and I was looking up at about a 65% angle.  I saw the bright white object in the sky.  It looked like a light from an aircraft pointing straight at you. then the light went out.  I could see a faint silver object still staionary.  Then it just vanished.  No jet trails no flashing lights.  I looked al over the sky to relocate it with no luck.;32.5264268041237;-93.6944030927836
I have not told anyone, afraid of being labelled a nut.;2006-03-13 23:00:00;10 minutes;I have not told anyone, afraid of being labelled a nut. about 40 lights moving in a southward position, some moved in a 90 degree angle.  One was a triangular shape.  It was cloudy, but in a break in the clouds gave us vision to the lights.  my wife and I and another couple saw it.  I am a history buff, and I do not know of any craft that can turn like they did. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD));32.5264268041237;-93.6944030927836
Bright white light traveling fast.;2013-12-31 20:51:00;~5 minutes;bright white light traveling  fast i whent outside on 12/31 around 8:50pm to whatch the fireworks that where popping around at that time, i noticed to my right a bright light moving from east to west which at first i thought was fireworks but it never went down seemed to be in a straight line headed west. thought it was a plane but i never heard any noise and it was traveling way to fast!!   also light was brighter than any plane i had ever saw (bright white). after about a minute i pulled my cell phone out to take a video of it  when i looked up its like it had turned to the north headed away from me.  i took a video of that for several minutes and  it was changing colors at that time like it was different , maybe because it was headed away from me ? ,then it just disappeared.  I have lived hear for over 13 years and i have seen shooting stars and all kinds of planes from the air-force base but honestly this i have never seen.  i don't think it was a plane cause i never heard any noise maybe a! meteor or something i don't know?;32.5264268041237;-93.6944030927836
