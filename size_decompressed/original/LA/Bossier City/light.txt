Bright blue/white light flies silently across evening sky.;2002-06-16 20:30:00;3 to 5 minutes;Bright blue/white light flies silently across evening sky. I was sitting in my backyard swing when I noticed a bright blue/white light flying across the sky from the north. The light appeared to be at low level, I would estimate not higher that 5000 feet. The light flew slowly across the sky in a straight line until it was almost due east of my position then it turned at about a 45 degree heading toward the southeast. There was no sound, which I thought odd because of the low altitude. The object was the same blue/white color as a mercury vapor street lamp with no apparent red or green navigation lights and no strobe. A few minutes after the object had disappeared behind the tree line, a commercial aircraft flew over at an estimated altitude of 30,000 feet and it's engines were clearly audible. I'm a retired aircraft mechanic with 20 years service in the Air Force and I am quite familiar with most of the aircraft that frequent Barksdale AFB and the Shreveport airport. This is a first for me. I don't know what it was.

Aerial orange/red light.;2013-06-23 21:00:00;10 minutes;Aerial orange/red light UFO Sighting in Bossier City, Louisiana on June 23rd 2013 - Aerial multiple-lights  At 2100I was standing outside with my wife looking at the supermoon rising in the east, when I saw an unusual orange-reddish light due NW that brighter than any stars or antenna masts markers in the sky.  It was slightly moving N-NW , then stopped for about 45sec, then traveled SE, then changed direction instantly moving NNW again,  it was at an unknown distance, but no more than a mile or two away at a 45 degree angle. Itâ€™s orange red color was steady for about 3 minutes while traveling NNW, then became a little dimmer as it changed direction south, then dimmed and resembled a star for a minute and was stationary, then became even brighter and began traveling NNW again. But not as fast as it was originally for about 2 minutes.  The light then dimmed and resembled a star for about 3 minutes, then disappeared entirely.  My home is directly above the landing path for Barksdale AFB, and being prior military and having B-52s and all kinds of other planes flying and approaching at all times of the day and night I a certain this was not a plane or jet. There is no jet engine or strobe light in the world that can put out the light we saw, or move and hover like this.  My wife and I had our suspicions about the UFO, but on my way to work the next morning the local radio station KVKI DJ was talking all morning abouta UFO that approached Barksdale AFB airspace, the tower hailed it 3 times to no avail and dispatched fighters. Who knows what they saw, but this area, particularly the AFB has had numerous sightings over the past few years & with the base housing half of our nuclear bombs & missiles, why not come check it out?  I have seen some weird things in my life in thesky as I work outside in remote locations, but nothing like this before.  (via mufon.com);32.5264268041237;-93.6944030927836
Orange orbs spotted;2013-07-14 21:20:00;15 minutes;orange orbs spotted the light appeared in the western sky at first when first saw it, the light looked like a plane coming toward me on fire. when it got closer i could see it was like an orange looking orb very bright it the proceeded to turn northwest and got very dim like a small red light.  at that point another one appeared in the same location it did the same thing. then a 3rd light. at the closest point the light was the size of a quarter in the sky.  i was in a grocery store parking lot my daughter and a man and his children saw it as well.  it was very odd and i have never seen anything like it before.   it made no noise and had no smoke or anything coming from it. i live right by a air force base  but the lights were in the opposite direction as the base. i have seen fireballs, shooting stars, meteorites, nothing compared to this. very slow moving each one took about 5 minutes to due its course.;32.5264268041237;-93.6944030927836
