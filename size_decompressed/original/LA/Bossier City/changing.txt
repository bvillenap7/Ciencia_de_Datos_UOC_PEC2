My friend and I were on our way to her house when we noticed this object floating over us. At first we thought it was a plane, but it wasn't making any noise and it wasn't moving. We kept on driving and it started following us. The object got really low beside some houses on my friend's side. She could see it really close by her window. She said that to her it looked like a circular object. What i saw, it did look like a circular object. Then it moved onto my side where I was driving. Then it seemed to have changed shape as it flew ahead of me over to my side. It then started to look like a rectangle that had two wings that looked like two block ends. There were no nose or tail on the object. The lights were not blinking, but they were solid and motionless. I turned to my friend to ask her to look at it and when she did it started flying toward a field at the end of the street. It flew into the field and started moving like it was bouncing up and down. While we were sitting in her driveway, it was still there. When we walked onto her front porch, thats when they dissapeared. We then saw them again later that night, looking out of the window by her bed.;32.5264268041237;-93.6944030927836
