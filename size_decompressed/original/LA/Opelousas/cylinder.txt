Oblong shape suspended in southern sky to the south and west of Opelousas, Louisiana.;2018-10-21 15:15:00;20 seconds;Oblong shape suspended in southern sky to the south and west of Opelousas, Louisiana. I was driving back home from checking on my farm, when I saw an oblong shape suspended ahead in the southern horizon.  I estimate this shape was 8-10 miles away from my position.   I pulled off to the side of the road and observed the shape for 10-15 seconds. It did not move.  It was perfectly still, and was at a slight angle in the sky.   After that, drove to my home, approximately 1 mile from where I was parked, to retrieve a pair of binoculars.  I could not see the shape from my house due to the trees, so I drove back to the spot I was at.  I estimate this took me 4 or 5 minutes.  By the time I got back to the position I last saw it, it was not in the sky.;30.5178000000003;-92.0878000000002
