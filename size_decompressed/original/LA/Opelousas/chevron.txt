Wing- shaped, low altitude, very fast, very large, completely silent, no running lights, black-colored.;2000-09-17 20:55:00;6-10 sec;Wing- shaped, low altitude, very fast, very large, completely silent, no running lights, black-colored. Flying-wing shaped object moving North to south.  No running lights.  Four or five very faint reddish bands visible fore-to-aft.  Very large.  Two other aircraft with running lights visible - one before siting and one immediately after.  No sound was heard  from object but other aircraft were audible.  Total viewing arc approx. 90 deg. Size estimated as width of outstretched hand. (About width of a 747 wing at 3000 ft.) Black in color, no reflected light observed.  Passed in front of two stars.  Overall impression was a very large, dark, wing-shaped object silently moving at a low altitude and a very high speed.  Reddish fore-to-aft light bands were very dim but marked the edges of the object quite well.  Any guesses?  Tell me it was a B-2 and I'll be happy.;30.5178000000003;-92.0878000000002
Completely silent enormous V shaped craft;2010-12-15 22:00:00;30 seconds;Completely silent enormous V shaped craft I am 49 years of age, married with 3 children and a practicing attorney.  On December 15, 2010 at approximately 9:20pm I was outside enjoying the cool evening and waiting for my oldest son to drive in from school. About ¼ mile from my house is a local high school.  The stadium lights were on since there was a soccer match being played.  I was looking south in the direction of the school when I noticed a fairly large light to my right about 1 mile away heading from west to east. It was on a track that would take it between my house and the school. At first I thought it was a plane but then I realized it was far too low. Then I thought it may have been a helicopter but as I continued to watch this light I noticed that there was no sound at all coming from the direction of the light. The light continued to move in an easterly direction at an amazingly slow speed. As it neared my location I could tell that it wasn’t just a single light. It was an enormous v shaped ! object with 3 almost blindingly bright lights on the under side of each “wing”. This object passed slowly between my location and the school at an altitude of less than 1000 feet. It continued moving east until it got just passed my location. As I was watching this object it simply vanished. Literally in the blink of an eye it was gone. The next morning as I was dropping my youngest son off at school I was stopped by the religion instructor who is a friend of mine. He excitedly began to tell me about the object he had seen the night before. His sighting lasted considerably longer than mine. He was driving back from a function when he saw this object. When he first saw the object it was moving very slowly in a southerly direction at less than 1000 feet. He watched the object for several minutes until it simply vanished. Within just a couple of seconds it reappeared at a distance my friend estimated to be at least 1 ½ miles away. My friend drove toward the object’s new locati! on and actually got to a point where he was nearly directly un! der this object. He confirmed that it had 3 lights under each wing and that it was an enormous v shaped craft. He also confirmed that it was completely silent. He continued to watch the object moving now in a westerly direction for another 30 seconds until the thing vanished again. That was the last time he saw it. My friend later learned that at least 10 kids who are students at the school also saw this thing.;30.5178000000003;-92.0878000000002
