Large fireball traveling to the ESE at 22:00 on September 8 in Southeast Louisiana;2015-09-08 22:00:00;2 seconds;Large fireball traveling to the ESE at 22:00 on September 8 in Southeast Louisiana At approximately  22:00 CST ((sic.  CDT)), a round yellowish white object moved very rapidly from WNW  to ESE and disappeared below the eastern horizon.  I was looking to the NE at the constellation Casseiopia and spotted it directly overhead.  I am not sure of the size but it was at least 20-100 times larger than an aircraft traveling in roughly the opposite direction at the same time.;30.443;-90.4386000000001
