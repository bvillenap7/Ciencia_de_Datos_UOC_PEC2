Bliding Bluish Light...;2008-11-09 20:40:00;3 Seconds;Bliding Bluish Light... My husband and I were sitting on our front steps.  Our lot is almost completely covered with very large, tall pine trees which obscures much of the sky.  I was looking down and he was looking upward when this flash of blinding blue light came from the tree tops.   We quickly looked around to determine if one of our neighbors had a spotlight or flashlight out, but the rest of our street was quiet.  There was no noise associated with the light and upon running to the end of our driveway, to have a look at the clear night sky, we did not observe anything, identified or not.
