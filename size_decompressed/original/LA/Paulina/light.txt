This area is in St. James Parish, Louisiana.  It was a clear night with a beautiful bright moon and the objects were moving west to east in a scattered pattern. They seemed to be moving about 30 miles an hour because we were able to follow them.  I then stopped the vehicle and got outside to see if we could hear any noise.  At that time all but one of them just disappeared.  We watched the last one and then it disappeared.  We did not hear any noise.;30.03;-90.7395
