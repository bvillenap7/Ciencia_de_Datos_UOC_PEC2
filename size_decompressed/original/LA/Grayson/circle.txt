There were three over all we saw the first two that had no light we could just barely see them in the sky and the last one was a gold orb shape and was traveling fast and then would zig-zag, moving 3 times faster than a normal commercial air plain.  I'm fascinated with the stars and I've never seen anything like it.  Plains don't move like that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));32.065;-92.173
