30 star like objects across clear night sky, incredible, once in a lifetime!;2015-10-02 20:37:00;10;30 star like objects across clear night sky, incredible, once in a lifetime! Was incredible, saw 30 to 35 star like objects moving in the sky.  Flying north to south, visible at Louisina to Texas border by Sabine River.   No formation noted, looked like stars, but with binoculars looked boomerang shape.  Where bright as stars or brighter.  Three adults, only one drinking and one child saw.  The objects moved south till they spread out in a line in an upward formation and disappeared slowly one by one.   The background was a clear night sky with a million stars, clear night.   Three adults saw them from front porch and went through the house to the back yard were we have 9 acres of clear sky.  Incredible!;31.9952;-93.9598
