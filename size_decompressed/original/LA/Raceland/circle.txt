One of the kids we were playing with said look at that and pointed to the ufo. although young at the time I knew what airplanes and blimps were and this was neither. As we were making comments on it and jumping with excitement  it seemed to implode on itself.Or left so fast we could not track its departure.This sighting was in the daylight sky but maybe a few months earlier me and my family were apparently chased in our vehicle at night on a deserted road by a circular light which seemed miles away at first then began to get larger and nearer as per to make my mother apply full acceleration away from this now very near and large approx 30 ft across bright circle. Later on in life my curiosity in the ufo mystery in which started out as a witness to incredable phenomanon but would later see my ufo documented on video in a Florida sighting. When I showed my brother the video he agreed it to be the daylight ufo we had seen years earlier. What disturbed me about our conversation he felt that there was something more to our sighting than we could recall. He suggested hypnosis. there are none here so the idea for that type of follow up unatainable. We are sure of what we saw and would take any test you want to prove our sincereness.
