Kids witness a UFO before school;2012-03-29 06:25:00;Before School;Kids witness a UFO before school Before school on the morning of 3-29-12. Myself and other students awaiting the bus were watching the stars. We had watched several stars move across the sky as the earth rotated. We knew they were stars because of their twinkle and the direction they were moving across the sky. We also saw a plane flying south and we could hear the sound and see the lights blinking.  Then over a thin sheet of clouds we saw a small light. It seemed to be a satellite.  As it passed over another sheet of clouds is disappeared.  It was moving relatively fast compared to the stars and planes we had seen. Also it was not moving the same direction as the stars due to the rotation of the Earth.  Within a few seconds the same light appeared again and had turned a 110 degree direction. We all witnessed the light as it moved slowly then stopped.  It moved and stopped several times. It moved over another sheet of clouds and we could not see it. We were all pretty confused by what we saw.  However, we know for sure it was not a helicopter because of how high the light was.  There were no sounds or other lights with it. The light never blinked or turned colors.;29.9755;-92.2983
