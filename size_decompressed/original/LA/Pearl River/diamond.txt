On Monday April 22, 2013 at 11:30PM, the same night of the meteor shower event, was an unidentified flying object appearing low in altitude. In the night sky the moon illuminated much of its light.  In addition, the clouds traveled in a fast pace manner in the direction, diagonally, towards this object. For clarity, an x shape could be formed in terms of the clouds and object.  Furthermore, this object seemed to be a diamond/imperfect circular shape.  A bright white light in the front glowed as it moved toward my direction. It moved at an incredibly fast speed with no sound following.  And had a short tail of vapor, not smoke, coming from the back end in the shape resembling a drawn out triangle.  This vapor dissipated rapidly.  When it approached directly overhead of my view I determined the shape and saw green and yellow lights going around the craft.;30.3987;-89.7823
