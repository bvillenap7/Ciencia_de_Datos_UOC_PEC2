Strange bright blue object moving erratically through night sky!!;2014-09-21 04:00:00;2 hours;Strange bright blue object moving erratically through night sky!! At 4 am, I looked out my bedroom window and seen something strange.  I watched for 2 hours trying to figure out what I was seeing.  It was bright blue and sometimes flashed to yellow.  The object was moving erratically and zig zagging around.  I recorded several videos and showed a few people and no one has any idea what it could be.  Definitely not anything man made.  It also seemed to change from a circular shape to cigar shape and a few times it disappeared completely and reappeared in another part of the sky.  It was a very clear night and this thing stood out very brightly.  Very interesting!!;30.3987;-89.7823
