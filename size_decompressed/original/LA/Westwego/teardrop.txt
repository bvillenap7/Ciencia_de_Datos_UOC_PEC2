Appeared to have crashed in the vicenity of Bayou Signette State Park, Westwego, LA.  Did not pursue nor investigate further nor disclose.  News did not report downed hellicopter nor other small aircraft.  Not a avid UFO follower, my concern is that this may be a drone launched from the Gulf.  I am not available to contact further regarding this.  This is being sent from a dynamically acquired I.P. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));29.8973;-90.2033
