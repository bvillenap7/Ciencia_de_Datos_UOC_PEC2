I then said to myself Thank You Lord for allowing me to see that. It was a beautiful green shooting star.  Then, it disappeared in the darkness.      When I got closer to Joor Road to turn, I noticed a ball of fire appear out of nowhere.   It stayed hovering there just above the tree lines for 10 minutes.

It had no smoke no flashing lights no noise and was able to move side to side towards and backwards.    It looked as if it was being flown....;30.5526;-91.0302
