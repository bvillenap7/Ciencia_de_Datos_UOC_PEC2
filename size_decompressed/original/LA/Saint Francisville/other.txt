4 aircraft machines with 5 large, round, blue lights flying just above the trees.;2014-09-17 20:00:00;1 hour;4 aircraft machines with 5 large, round, blue lights flying just above the trees. I had gotten off work a couple of hours before and went outside to talk on the phone, as there is poor cell reception where I live. First, I saw one of these and I was in complete disbelief.  I never looked away, but I tried pulling up my camera. I was just about to head inside after it had passed over the trees, but then I saw another.  I was so transfixed by what I was seeing, I couldn't bring myself to come to my senses and get my camera ready, and I figured it would have been really difficult to see anyway. There were 4 of them one right after the other.  It's hard to describe what they looked like, and I'm hoping they're just some form of aircraft I've never seen before. There were five large, round, blue lights: one in the center and one on each end of these rectangular-shaped wings.  They seemed to be black, and flying not much higher than the trees in my area.  They were fully symmetrical (even though it's hard to see in country darkness) and flying very low to the ground. Once all 4 had flown by and I the sound started fading in the distance, I rushed inside to see if anyone else had seen or heard them.  Perhaps 10 minutes later, there were maybe 20 other aircraft flying at a much higher altitude which we all just assumed were military jets, though that would be unclear.  They were extremely loud and were going in the same direction as the aircraft that had initially passed by. I have yet to be offered an explanation as to what the first 4 were and I'm hoping I can find someone who might be able to tell me what they were or saw the same thing.  I did leave out one minor detail to see if anyone else can vouch for what I'm saying here.;30.8732;-91.4227
