Black circular object illuminates orange light, and then flies away without sound.;2009-07-14 23:00:00;20 seconds;Black circular object illuminates orange light and then flies away without sound It was dark out and there was little light pollution. I was at a stable with horses and their trainer, when they started acting agitated and panicked.  I looked around to see if anyone was driving up, as vehicles are a common thing that spooks these horses.  I looked up and a perfect circle appear about the size of the moon in the sky just about a thumb's length away from the moon if the hand were to be held to the sky.  It was a bright orange color a faded into a more red color during the event.  The way it appear was almost like a rapid moon phase, with one side appearing as a crescent and relatively quickly opening up into a full circle.  It was stationary for about 10 seconds before moving around in the same general area in a quick, almost erratic way.  As the red color darkened, it disappeared in the same manner it had appeared, but in the opposite direction.  A faint black circle was left in the place of where the lights had been, but it was no longer illumina! ted or emitting a halo effect.  The black object accelerated rapidly towards the tree line.  The entire event was silent, and upon the disappearance of the object the horse were calm again.  I have returned to the site a few times over the years and have not seen the object ever again.;30.8732;-91.4227
