Spheres in naked eye visuals and in developed photos as well, in NW Louisiana.;2002-08-11 14:00:00;4 seconds;Spheres in naked eye visuals and in developed photos as well, in NW Louisiana. Two spheres appeared in developed photos taken of sky, clouds, and trails. Was not any naked eye sighting involved. However, I did have a naked eye visual of one sphere later on, coming directly from exact East to West heading. Sphere was a bright golden/yellow color, with the light source appearing to be from the object itself and not reflective light from the sun. The weather was stable, not humid, and fairly clear sky, save for one small cloud formation. The sphere was about the size of a b-b held at arms length. It traversed  across about 1/3 of the sky in about 5 seconds, then entered the one small cloud and never exited the cloud. The sky past the cloud was very blue and clear and unobstructed and a good visual of the sphere sould have occurred had it left the cloud formation. It either blinked out in the cloud or perhaps ascended straight up?? There was no contrail coming from the sphere, no sparks, and it flew rapidly in a very straight trajectory. No sound  evident from it. Was  exactly the same type sphere as those in the photo I emailed to you and I  consistently have these sphere type objects show up in other developed sky photographs of mine, as well. Have had many anomalous craft appear in other photos, as well as visual sightings that I have reported to NUFORC and other organizations through most of my life. I have other sphere photos that may be of interest. The one I emailed was best for clarity.;32.3886;-93.4981
