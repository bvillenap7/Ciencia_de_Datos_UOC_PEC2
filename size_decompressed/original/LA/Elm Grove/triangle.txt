The craft was large, well lit, and no sound whatsoever. The size upon first spotting it was about the size of an inch at arms length. As it moved closer, it was evident to be quite large, no sound whatsoever and hovered for a time and then moved very, very slowly to the Southeast, then, did a very slow, graceful U turn and heading was North after that. Was in view for quite some time. Called out husband to observe also. Had Large, bright white light at nose, smaller green and white lights at the back of the wedge shape. Seemed very long, narrow, and large, yet no sound. Continued slowly beyond the trees until out of sight. Thought this was interesting in light of the earlier sighting we had earlier this same night of 3 bright oval objects at 20:00 not too far from our home. We were riding home and in a nearby town. Others were observing the oval objects as well. The wedge shaped craft was very graceful and beautiful. ((name deleted));32.3886;-93.4981
