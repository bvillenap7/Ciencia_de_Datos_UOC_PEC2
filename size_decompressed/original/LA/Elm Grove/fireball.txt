Fiery object sighted  in NW Louisiana;2002-05-10 21:30:00;6 seconds;Fiery object sighted  in NW Louisiana Observed a bright orange/white object about the size of a B-B held at arms length. It had a bright light trail behind it but not vapor trail or smoke following behind...just bright light streak on a North West heading seeming to be passing over Barksdale AFB. Seemed to look larger as it got lower and was expecting to hear impact sound...none followed though. Some other unusual lights and groupings of lights in the area flying slow and low.;32.3886;-93.4981
