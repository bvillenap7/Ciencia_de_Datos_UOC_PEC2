MY SON, WIFE AND MYSELF WITNESSED A LARGE HEXAGON SHAPED OBJECT IN THE NIGHT SKY. COULD NOT TELL THE EXACT OUTER SHAPE. IT WAS COMPOSED OF SIX HEXAGONAL SHAPED LIGHTS, ARRANGED IN A HEXAGON SHAPE. NOT BRIGHT, BUT CONSTANT IN BRILLIANCE. THE LIGHTS WERE A DIFFUSED COLOR. (THE INTENSITY OF A LAMP SHADE, LIGHT CREAM TO TAN). I NOTICED THAT I COULD NOT SEE ANY STARS IN THE SKY BETWEEN THE LIGHTS. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE OF SINGULAR ORIGIN AND NOT SIX INDIVIDUAL. THE CRAFT (S) WERE ON THE SAME WESTERLY DIRECTION AS THE AIRLINE. THE REASON I NOTICED THE OBJECT WAS DUE TO THE PASSING OF AN AIRLINER JUST BEFORE AND I WAS WATCHING THE PROGRESS OF THE IT MOVING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION. THE UFO LATER USED THE SAME PATH. COULD NOT TELL THE ALTITUDE OF IT, BUT SEEMED TO BE AT THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE AIRLINER. HOWEVER MUCH LARGER. (THERE WAS NO NOISE OF ANY KIND) I LIVED AT THE TIME RIGHT NEXT TO THE NAVAL AIR BASE IN BELLE CHASSE AND WAS WONDERING WHY NO MILITARY AIRCRAFT WERE ALERTED TO INTERCEPT THIS UFO, LIKE THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO CHASE EVERY UNKNOWN OBJECT IN THE PASS. I LATER ASSUMED THAT IT COULD BE A SECRET TYPE OF CRAFT OWNED BY THE MILITARY AND KEPT HUSH HUSH ABOUT THE OBJECT. I FELT ODD ABOUT REPORTING THIS IN THE PASS, BUT FINALLY REALIZED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY EITHER NOT SEEN ON THEIR RADAR OR THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE LIKE THIS BEFORE OR SINCE. I WAS IN THE AIR FORCE DURING THE LATE FIFTIES AND I THE RESERVES IN THE SIXTIES. I STUDIED ELECTRONIC AND HYDRAULIC UNITS FOR AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES. I OWNED A CESSNA IN THE SEVENTIES AND HAVE SEEN OTHER THINGS THAT WERE CONSIDERED UFO SIGHTINGS WHILE FLYING, BUT COULD HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED AS EITHER NATURAL OR MAN MADE TYPES. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF ANY ONE HAS SEEN AN OBJECT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN THE PASS OR RECENT HISTORY. I HAVE OFTEN WONDERED WEATHER THESE UFO OBJECTS ARE FROM OUT FUTURE OR ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM.
