Bright light changing colors about 20-30 miles in the night sky.;2003-11-30 18:30:00;15 minutes;Bright light changing colors about 20-30 miles in the night sky. I was on waiting on the Belle Chasse bridge because it was up.  It was a clear night and about 20 stars were visible above, but in the distance towards the south my girlfriend and me seen a light.  She thought it was a star the whole time until it disappeared.  The object was about 20 - 30 miles away.  All I could see was a white light stationary in the air changing from bright red to white to green.  It would get bright then dim then bright.  The bridge was up for a while and I kept watching this object.  I looked to see if anyone else was watching the object and they were not.  I turned around and it was gone.;29.8345;-90.0076
