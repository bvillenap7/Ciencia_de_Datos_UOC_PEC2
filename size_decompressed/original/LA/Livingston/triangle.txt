BRIGHT OBJECT SPOTTED IN THE NIGHT SKY IN LIVINGSTON, LA.;2007-02-17 19:00:00;5 MINUTES;BRIGHT OBJECT SPOTTED IN THE NIGHT SKY IN LIVINGSTON, LA. THE NIGHT WAS VERY CLEAR AND COOL.  I WAS TELLING A FRIEND ABOUT A SIGHTING THE PREVIOUS DAY.  WE JOKED ABOUT WHAT I HAD SEEN AS ILLUSIONS OR DELUSIONS.  THEN AS I WAS EXPLAINING WHAT I HAD SEEN A BRIGHT LIGHT APPEARED IN THE EAST. I POINT TO THE LIGHT A EXCLAIMED  WHAT THE HELL IS THAT !   MY FRIEND THOUGHT I JUST JOKING, BUT WHEN HE TURNED AROUND, HE SPOTTED IT ALSO.  MY SON ALSO SPOTTED THE LIGHT.   THE LIGHT BEGAN TO SPREAD A GROW TO FORM A PERFECT TRIANGLE.  IT APPEARED TO BE IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE OR LOW ORBIT.  IT STAYED ILLUMINATED FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES THEN BEGAN TO SLOWLY FADE OUT.  IT DID NOT MOVE FROM ITS ORGINAL LOCATION.   THIS WAS A VERY STRANGE COINCIDENCE BECAUSE I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF EXPLAINING TO HIM A SIGHTING THAT I HAD JUST SEEN THE DAY BEFORE.   I HAVE NEVER EXPEIENCED AN UNEXLPAINED PHENOMENON BEFORE THIS.  I AM VERY LEVEL HEADED AND BELIEVE THAT THEIR IS A REASONABLE EXPLANATION.;30.4723;-90.771
triangle shaped UFO viewed over Livingston Loisiana heading due North;2010-08-24 20:40:00;5 mins;triangle shaped UFO viewed over Livingston Loisiana heading due North object had 3 white/yellow lights forming perfect triangle, and 1 red pulsating light in center.  It moved from south to north just in and below the low clouds.   The craft made no sound. I could not make out a clear outline of the craft, but it apeart do be triangle in shape as it passed in front of the moonlit clouds. I have several years experience working in aviation both military and civilian, and this fits with no previous observation of FAA aproved aircraft lighting.
