Very bright ball of light seen above the tree line on I-12 in Louisiana;2005-10-29 22:00:00;3 seconds;Very bright ball of light seen above the tree line on I-12 in Louisiana It was a very bright ball of light that was visible above the tree line on the northern side I-12 in Louisiana between the cities of Hammond and Baton Rouge (probably close to Livingston or Walker).   It moved extremely fast and was only visible for about three seconds, but not because the view was obstructed--it just disappeared.   We thought it was a meteor, but it was moving horizontally, and was in the Earth's atmosphere much lower than a commercial jet would normally fly.;30.4723;-90.771
