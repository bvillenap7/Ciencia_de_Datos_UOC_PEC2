Silver reflective object that immediately disappears!;2020-11-12 08:10:00;5 seconds;Silver reflective object that immediately disappears! 1 shiny silver, slightly disc-shaped object that reflected the sunâ€™s light.  It could have been metallic.  I thought it could have been some type of plane at first or possible helicopter due to it being closer to the ground than anticipated.  I attempted to dismiss this as something known.  Stayed in place for approximately 5 seconds and then immediately disappeared without a trace.  It disappeared faster than I could process what I had seen.  I contacted a close relative later that night and reported this UFO sighting.  I was informed by the relative that the night before around 6:30pm in the same area they had witnessed an object flying straight up in the air which seemed to come from the ground.;29.6636;-90.9759
