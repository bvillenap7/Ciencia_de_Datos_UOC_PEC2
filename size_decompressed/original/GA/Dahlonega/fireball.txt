Driving home on a winding mountain road at night I saw a very bright large green fireball object traveling from east to west streak across the sky leaving a red tail or streak behind. It almost looked as if there were two of them but perhaps it was the same red streak from the fireball I witnessed. It was about the size of 1 1/2 full moons. It was very bright and caught my eye even though I was driving on mountainous roads from Blueridge, Ga. to Dahlonega and then home. I keep a cell phone in my van at all times and it was turned on lying on the passengers seat connected to the AC adapter which emits a light on the phone. At the same time I saw the fireball in the sky my cell phone cut off. I could tell this last fact easily because the light was off. I tried to turn the phone on but could not and it stayed off for about 30 seconds. Then I was able to turn it on. I could not tell if the fireball type object had fallen to earth because I was traveling on a narrow state highway with trees on either side. It was an exciting event to witness;34.5317204819277;-83.9721277108434
