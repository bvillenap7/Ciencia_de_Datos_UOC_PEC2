A stationary bowl shaped object with colored lights.;2000-09-09 22:30:00;at least 1 hour;A stationary bowl shaped object with colored lights. At 10:30 PM a flashing object was noticed in the southeastern sky. The object appeared to be just below the moon and yet was clearly visible. With binoculars we could see red, green, purple, and white lights. At times these colors seemed to spin around the object as it took the shape of a bowl. At other times the object appeared to have no shape just flashes of color. There was very little movement. We watched for about 1 hour before retiring. It was an extremely strange thing to see and I will never forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Description seems not inconsistent with a celestial body, but we did not see it.
