Unidentified Black Diamond Shaped Flying Objects Seen;2011-03-17 19:00:00;2 minutes;Unidentified Black Diamond Shaped Flying Objects Seen In  Dahlonega, Georgia, at around 19:00 hours on March 17th, 2011,  my son called me to the front door of my home and pointed out a loose formation of black diamond shaped objects flying a quarter or perhaps even three quarters of a mile away at low altitude (i.e. 500 â€“ 1,000 feet).   Initially we thought that they might have been paratroopers parachuting, or a squadron of Black Hawk helicopters (from the nearby Ranger base) or perhaps birds.  They had no running lights, there was no sound whatsoever and they were too large from a distance to have been birds.  Although I described them to be in a loose formation, the first several were in formation, the others not so.  I have never seen anything like this.;34.5317204819277;-83.9721277108434
