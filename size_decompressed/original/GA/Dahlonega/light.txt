Unknown lights over Dahlonega, GA.;2014-03-20 23:30:00;6 minutes;Unknown lights over Dahlonega GA Very bright lights flashing across the width.   Noticed it sitting in one spot facing directly west from the eastern side of Dahlonega.  Lights appeared high in the sky and just parked in one spot.   After a couple of minutes it moved directly away from us heading west at a low rate of speed.  It eventually went out of view.   The lights were reddish orange and seemed to pulse rather than blink.  Very interesting to watch! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.5317204819277;-83.9721277108434

I was on the phone with a friend of mine and was looking out the window of my bedroom when a light appeared heading north from the top of the window.  I thought at first it could have been a plane but there were no flashing lights and it was moving around the sky erratically.  It was heading in a general northern direction but was curving to the left and right in ways that a plane couldn't have.  I then thought that maybe it was a drone but those too have flashing lights and it seemed close enough that I would have been able to see them.   Once it got about three quarters' down the length of my window it stopped moving and then just disappeared.  There were no trees or anything that it could have moved behind.  It was just in the sky, and it just blinked out and was gone.;34.5317204819277;-83.9721277108434
