A large, white moon-like object fell out of the sky, disintegrating as it fell.;2003-11-22 20:20:00;10 seconds;A large, white moon-like object fell out of the sky, disintegrating as it fell. This may have been some kind of military thing because we live fairly close to the Army Ranger station.  This is what we saw.  It was a very clear, starry night.  We stepped off our front porch to take a walk.  We live in the mountains, so our horizon is high.  I glanced toward the west and saw a big, very bright full moon hanging several degrees above the mountain ridge.  We were looking through a lot of bare tree branches.  I remember wondering how the moon could be setting in the west when it was fairly early evening.  I looked away and then glanced back.  The moon began to fall rapidly toward an area behind the mountain ridgeline.  It was surreal - how could the moon be moving that fast?  Then the bottom of the moon started to disintegrate into lots of white dots.  The disintgration process went from the bottom of the disc to the top, but it fell behind the ridgeline before I saw the whole thing disintegrate.  It did not break up into lots of smaller spheres like what I have heard people report.  It actually disintegrated into hundreds of tiny lights that fell as the disc fell, but they streamed below the disc toward the earth.  It was sort of like watching the sand drop from the middle of an hour glass, only the sand was coming from the rapidly disintegrating disc.  There was no explosion or any kind of sound reaching us.  That was all.;34.5317204819277;-83.9721277108434
Bright orange sphere.  ((NUFORC Note:  Source remains anonymous.  Possible hoax, we wonder?  PD));2014-01-21 19:30:00;15 seconds;I was walking down a sidewalk during the evening, and saw a bright orange sphere.  It was too big to be a plane, it did not flash like a plane and it was too bright to be a star.   Then after seeing it for about 12 seconds it slowly vanished.
