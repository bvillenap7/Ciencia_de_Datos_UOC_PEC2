Formation of lights (possibly connected) moving across sky erratically.;2014-10-17 23:30:00;3 days;Formation of lights (possibly connected) moving across sky erratically. Sighted a group of five or six lights moving in formation across the sky over a field.  They seemed to be connected to form some kind of craft, though it was hard to tell unless you looked very closely.  Some of them were colored red and green. The movement was irregular, it almost looked as if the craft was swimming or crawling. Pointed them out to my partner and we watched for a good hour or so.  We returned to the same field for two more nights, and the formation/lights were still there, though the object moved less and the lights seemed dimmer.;34.5317204819277;-83.9721277108434
