Bright blinking light that just disappeared into thin air;2007-10-20 09:20:00;10 mins that pm;Bright blinking light that just disappeared into thin air myself and two others were pulling into someones driveway when this particular star caught all of our eyes. It started as a dim blinking light which then turned very bright and then disappeared. It never moved while glowing so it couldn't have been an airplane. What it was, we really don't know, but we definantly know it wasn't an airplane!;33.5368;-83.3435
