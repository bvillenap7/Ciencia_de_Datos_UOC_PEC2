I was outside driving on an Atlanta highway near 8 PM when I looked in the sky and saw what appeared to be a triangular shaped aircraft flying in a massive circle around the city with what appeared to be a fighter jet trailing it.   At first I suspected it was a military plane or commercial aircraft, but there were five lights in a triangle formation that clearly allowed me to see the shape of the craft and it looked like no military plane that i had ever seen.   It was certainly not a commercial aircraft.;33.5368;-83.3435
