low hovering large flat object with very loud roaring sound.;1980-06-01 21:00:00;10 seconds;low hovering large flat object with very loud roaring sound. My mom, sister and I were returning from a softball game and stopped to get the mail from our rural mailbox. All of a sudden there was an extremely loud roaring vibration and I looked up through the windshield and then stuck my head out of the window. What I saw was a very large flat surface right above the tree tops. It appeared to be metal and was visible at night though I did not see particular lights. They may have been above the craft and I could only see the bottom. It hovered above our car but was extended over the trees on both sides of the highway.(Highway 22 East). It was very large and very loud, then in an instant it was gone. It either disappeared or took off at such a high rate of speed that we could not even see the direction that it was travelling.  What makes this so real is that my father was in his truck 2 miles behind us. When he came in we were standing in the kitchen staring at each other and he said you are not going to believe what I saw. He described exactly what we had seen. He called the Air force Base at Warner Robins GA but they said they did not know of anything in the area. The neighbors a quarter of a mile away also said the saw something at this same time.;33.0162;-83.5412999999999
