Daytime metallic silver oval object in McDuffie County (Thomson) GA.;1995-06-15 11:30:00;15 seconds;Daytime metallic silver oval object in McDuffie County (Thomson) GA. Traveling down the highway in the backseat I had this weird feeling and I looked out the window and my eyes went directly to this beautiful metallic silver oval object with no windows or anything on it, It was around the size of probably a small home and at the altitude of a lite aircraft, not far away at all really. It just seemed to be stuck in time not moving at all. I watched it intently almost as if I had no control... until it bolted into the only cloud in the bright blue sky not to return. The speed it traveled was unreal, more of a blur really and at a sharp downward angle. Amazingly it's speed seemed to be instantaneous. Example: like going 0 mph to lighting speed. No one else has ever mentioned seeing this object in the area or County, nor was it in the local town newspaper but it did indeed occur as clear as day.  (Object was located over the Belle Meade Country Club Golf Course right passed the local Airport, we had a private plane at one time and trust me this was no plane.)
