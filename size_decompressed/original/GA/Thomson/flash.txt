I've seen a bright flash of light three times in the same area.;2003-10-29 00:15:00;3-5 seconds;I've seen a bright flash of light three times in the same area. Last August around O:00AM I was working down at a pump station on Lake Thurmond. After doing my work at the station I locked up and headed back to the main pumping station. On my way back I witnessed a flash of bright white/blue light all around me (outside...in the truck with me). The light was so bright I stoped the truck right away and had trouble focusing (kind of like the effect when someone takes a picture with the flash on). After rubbing my eyes and regaining my focus in my eyes, I continued on my way. It scared me but after thinking about it, I passed it off as lighting.  A few months after that the same thing happened again. Bright flash of light, only I wasn't in the truck I was walking to the truck. Needless to say it scared me once again. Being the second time, I said something to my co-worker about it. After telling them, they  told me a guy who worked there before me had told them once about a bright flash light.   Now the reason for me reporting tonight. Earlier tonight around 0:15AM I was on my way down to the pump station and again I saw the bright flash light.;33.4801;-82.4906
