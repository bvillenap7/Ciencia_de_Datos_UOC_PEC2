If so, it would have been triangular.  No noise.  Flying very slowly almost hovering.  After several minutes they faded away.  Never seen anything like it.  One light at the end or tail was further back than the other lights.   Has anyone in the Thomson area seen this.  Can't believe we were the only ones who saw this.;33.4801;-82.4906
