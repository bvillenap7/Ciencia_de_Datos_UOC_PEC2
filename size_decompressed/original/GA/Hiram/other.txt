lights brighter than stars in west;1999-05-14 21:00:00;1 hour;lights brighter than stars in west I live west of Atlanta Georgia.  When I stand on my back deck and look southwest, you'll see a light that's brighter than any other star.  At first I thought it was a star, but it moved vertically and horizontally.  Sometimes it changes colors.  About 2 weeks ago it was flashing red, green, and white.  This light is out there almost every night.  It's pretty weird.  My wife, father-in-law, and 2 neighbors have witnessed it. It's been there almost every night since I first saw it starting about 1 year ago when I stated to put on my pool deck. I am in the flight path of Atlanta Hartsfield Airport.  But it definitely not a plane or copter.  It just looks light a bright star that moves and changes colors.;33.8683;-84.7736
