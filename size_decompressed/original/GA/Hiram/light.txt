Four Check mark shaped lights seen in the night sky over Georgia, traveling west to east.;2006-11-19 02:30:00;3 to 5 seconds;Four Check mark shaped lights seen in the night sky over Georgia, traveling west to east. While watching the sky to get a glimpse of the meteor shower caused by the Leonid Meteor, I observed 4 lights travelling from west to east in a set formation.  The lights maintained the same heading and did not break formation or streak like a shooting star.  The lights seemed very far away and were sort of dim, not bright and piercing like plane lights, but more like the glow of a low watt bulb.  Although the lights were travelling at a high altitude, they crossed the sky in seconds.  I did not witness any vapor entrails but it was night and the city lights in the distance did not allow for a good star-watch night.  To imagine what the lights look like, make an upside down check mark.  The three points of the check mark would signify a light, but the long side had three lights evenly spaced.;33.8683;-84.7736
Hovering light seen over Hiram at 5am.;2015-09-11 05:00:00;15 minutes;Hovering light seen over Hiram at 5am. I was driving alone down Nebo Road heading towards 92 past the Ingles Gas Station, when I saw a light too bright to be a star and too low and bright to be an airplane.   It was only  hovering for a solid 15 minutes, before disappearing, but I did not see where it took off to.   Other cars were in driving the road so I don't know if others possibly saw this event as well.  Hope to see more, they're coming back.

02/23/2017:  2 bright light sightings in Hiram, Georgia, Paulding County along 92 east between 8:30 - 9 PM.;2017-02-23 21:00:00;20-30 minutes;02/23/2017:  2 bright light sightings in Hiram, Georgia, Paulding County along 92 east between 8:30 - 9 PM. UFO Sighting: 2 lights moving  It was Thursday, February 23, 2017, about 8:30 PM driving home from bible study, about a 15 minute drive home with my three minor children and my friend.  As I turned right off the Douglas-Hiram road, route 92, I noticed two moving objects with bright lights that just moved horizontal across the sky.  They were not close together but distanced apart but moving at the same level across the sky.  I said something to my friend.  She then saw them as did my children. As I drove along we all watched.  I turned into my subdivision and onward to my house in the cul-de-sac. Trees blocked my view into my subdivision to my first left turn up to my right turn onto my street.  Just at the intersecting streets, the view was clear.  We could still see these two bright lighted sightings just gliding across the sky at the same eye level and same distance apart.  The two lighted sightings didn't seem to be very high in the sky but distance enough to just see the lights which appeared to be linear horizontals.  We watched as long as we could on the tree lined street into my cul-de-sac before I reached my garage. I am not sure if this was reported by others, and we did research the Internet to see if anyone reported this.  I just really find this strange. I myself have witnessed three UFO sightings in Baltimore, Maryland in the summer during the late 60s and early 70s.  Those sightings were witnessed by several people where the sightings just seem to be suspended mid air about I'd say about 400 feet off the ground having what appeared to be lights circling the flying object having flown very close to our community recreation center viewed through the paneled windows some 22 feet from the floor.  At that time, 20 plus people saw this on movie night.  The sighting ended over the field on an elementary school property, Bentalou Elementary, to be exact.   I would see two other sightings from my home on Lexington Street, Baltimore, Maryland.  I say this to say, I believe there are UFOs which makes me sensitive, alert and observant to anything flying in the sky.  These two lighted sightings just struck us as odd. Curious to find out if anyone saw what we saw on February 23, 2017;33.8683;-84.7736
