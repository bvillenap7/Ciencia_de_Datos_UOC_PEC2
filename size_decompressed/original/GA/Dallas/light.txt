Flashing disc followed us, blinked back at our flashlights, lights died, and fiance was zapped to the ground.;2006-10-29 02:00:00;about 1 hour;Flashing disc followed us, blinked back at our flashlights, lights died, and fiance was zapped to the ground. Toward the end of October my fiance & I had been seeing odd things in the sky a lot. we tend to be night owls and we would go walking between midnight and 4am regularly.  She lived with her sister at that point & a new subdivision was being built about 500 yards down from their house.  Over this new sub we regularly saw lights and strange shapes darting about. As we were walking down the street (Benson rd) we saw a disc shaped object approximately a quarter mile ahead of us and probably around 10,000 feet up  It seemed to spin, and white lights shining from it began to blur as it spun around.  We kept walking and it appeared to follow us as we walked.  This all tripped me out due to the fact i was a new believer in UFOs, but she wasn't intimidated by the craft. she decided to blink her flashlight at it to see what would happen. after flashing the light at it, the craft fired off blue, green, and red flares in the same pattern as the light blinked.  We continued our walk, occasionally shining the light skyward with the same results as before.  The craft would also follow the light if we moved the light around. As we headed back to the house, we shone the lights skyward again, illuminating the craft once more.  Suddenly the lights died, and it was not batteries dying.  Both light had freshly charged batteries before we left the house.  As we walked back, we kept looking  back to see the craft following us.  I cannot remember what the neighbors dogs were doing, but it was likely not their typical come out and challenge us behavior.  The craft had followed us all the way back and as it was over the neighbors house, my fiance  felt as if she was shaking or having a seizure.  As we got into the front yard, she suddenly collapsed to the ground.  I helped her to her feet and we went inside.  A final look out the front door showed the craft hovering above the front porch.
