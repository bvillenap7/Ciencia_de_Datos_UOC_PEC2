For a second, I believed I was seeing a star, and then it started moving closer.  Then another reddish orange object came up to the side of it, and it was circular in the center, but it also had tendrils of orange around it and was moving forward also.   They both hovered for a minute and then disappeared in the same direction they came from.  I almost believed for a minute that they were bombs coming from the sky.   I don't know how else to explain them.  It definitely shook me up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.906702097902;-84.842195804196
