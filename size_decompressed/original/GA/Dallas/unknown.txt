Two white dots at high altitude traveling very close to each other.;2017-04-25 21:30:00;1-2 minutes;Two white dots at high altitude traveling very close to each other. My son and I were outside walking our dog.  I happened to look up in the NE sky directly above us and saw 2 dots tracking in an easterly direction.  They appeared to be at an extremely high altitude and traveling faster than a normal aircraft at such a high altitude.  They continued to track together.   Neither my son nor I saw navigation lights flashing but only two solid white dots.   What was so unusual was that the dots were too close to be aircraft traveling that fast with no navigation lights.;33.906702097902;-84.842195804196
