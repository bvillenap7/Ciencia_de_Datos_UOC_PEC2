It appeated to be spinning and hovered for about 15 minutes. I was going to be and happened to look out my window. I saw an unusually bright star i the western sky. This one appeared to have been spinning with colors that I could make out to be red, yellow, blue and white. I called my husband and he came and thought it was a star. We both went out side with a video camera and taped it. It appeared to be the only object in the sky at the time meaning no planes or helicopters with flashing light. It just hovered in sky for about 15 minutes. All of the dogs that live around here were barking. It was really cold so we went inside. I got on the internet to see if there had been others who had seen it. It had been about five minutes since we had come inside and my husband told me it was gone. we went back outside and it was gone but a similar object was now in the eastern sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  However, if it was not distinctly below the clouds at any time during the sighting, we feel that the first possibility to be ruled out would be a celestial body, perhaps a twinkling star, or a planet.
