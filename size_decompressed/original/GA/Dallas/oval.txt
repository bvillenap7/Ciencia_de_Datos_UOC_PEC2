Looked up and saw these beautifull lights.  First they were whiteish mav color that were going around,1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4, then at the same time bulegreen lights were make the  same pattern.  1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4.  There was a third color looked like it was in the center and it was solid.  Then they started a reverse pattern. It was headed from east to west. From atlanta to Alabama direction. It was or looked like it was around maybe 1000ft to 1500 ft high, and it was moving really slow. There was no sound it just kind of floated  right over my head, and it was, looked like it was spinning very slowly.  It was oval or like an elongated egg.  One end was fat the other was noticeably smaller.  I had a flashlight and flashed at it but it just keep move and went over the top of the trees.  I dont know what it was but it was very pretty.  It was very cool to see.;33.906702097902;-84.842195804196
