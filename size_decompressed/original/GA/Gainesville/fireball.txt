Several more followed  Hovering slowly in a pertern moving from Northwest to southeast.  Each was spaced about 1 minute apart.   They looked to be flying low under the heavy cloud cover.   Objects didn't appear to be very steady, like they were slightly shaking.  They were very bright. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Where I live we have the bright orange street lamps illuminating our streets and parking areas, this was pretty much the same color and intensity except it glowed as an open flame not a light. While watching television, out of the corner of my eye this moving light caught my attention outside my french doors leading to my porch.  To get a better look, I went outside and observed the object traversing about 45 degrees above the horizon in an easterly direction from where I was standing.  The object was flickering as though on fire, the way a flame appears to the eye. While living in Florida I've seen many rocket and shuttle launches from the Cape, the glow emitted looked very similar, but there was not any smoke or exhaust trailing the 'fireball' that I observed as it flew by, also I was unable to hear any sound as a jet, helicopter, or prop aircraft would make.;34.3128800120058;-83.8343698079261
