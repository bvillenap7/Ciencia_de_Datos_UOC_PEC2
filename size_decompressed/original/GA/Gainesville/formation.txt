On February 6, 2008 at about 7:15 p.m. my 6 year old son and I were on our way to pick my daughter up from ballet class.  It was dark out.  We were driving down Green Hill Road in Gainesville towards Ledan Road and right up in front of us just above the trees was a large group of white lights.  They were very bright and  very still.  They were lined up all in a row horizontally very close to each other.  I remember there being about 5 or 6 of them, my son says there were 5.  There was a plane flying around them to the right.  The thing that was so striking was how still they were.  They just totally didn’t move for the minute or so that we came down the road.  The plane flying around them was moving all around but the objects just hovered there.  I am not good at all with size or distance, but I’ll tell you what it looked like from where I was.  It was about 6 inches long, only about 6-12 inches above the tree line and appeared to be less than a mile from me.  I am a 35 year old stay at home mom of 2.  I am not sure that I have ever really believed in U. F. O. s before, but I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I immediately called my husband at work as soon as I turned onto another road and could not view them anymore and told him all about it.  On our way home from picking up my daughter, we looked in the same exact area and nothing was there.  I have been racking my brain trying to figure out what they could have been.  I came right home from picking up my daughter to search the internet to see if anyone else in my area saw something strange in the sky tonight.  My 6 year old son was also a witness and he was amazed by the sight too.  He counted the lights and remembered there were 5.;34.3128800120058;-83.8343698079261

My sister yelled what is that and pointed up we looked and quickly noticed six or seven red lights.;2015-08-25 09:45:00;3 minutes;Me and my family were going to the store when my sister yelled what is that and pointed up we looked and quickly noticed six or seven red lights in the sky in almost a c shape, but they looked connected to each other.   I pulled my phone out but the picture is to blurred to make the lights out...but it took about 3 minutes to go out of sight.  Did anyone else see this?;34.3128800120058;-83.8343698079261
