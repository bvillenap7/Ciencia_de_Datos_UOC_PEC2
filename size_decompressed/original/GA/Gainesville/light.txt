Bright white lights over Gainesville, GA, doesn't move for 30 minutes.;2006-03-14 06:00:00;30 minutes;Bright white lights over Gainesville, GA, doesn't move for 30 minutes. I woke up at 6:00am this morning and the first thing I saw out the bedroom window was an extremely bright white light in the dark sky.  It was not moving and was the only visible light in the sky.  I could not see any stars.  I kept watching it.  Eventually, I went to get the binoculars for a better view.  I could see five or six square lights in a row: the middle light being the biggest.  Inside or behind these six lights was a brighter light that moved from the middle to the far right side.  There was no rhythm to the movement of the brightest light.  Sometimes the whole object would fade away, like it was going away from me, not across the sky like an airplane, but move back from me in depth.  I did see clouds moving across it.  The object stayed there in the same spot in the sky for at least 30 minutes.  I did not see it leave because I had to get in the shower however, I did make my husband get up and he saw it too.;34.3128800120058;-83.8343698079261

Large bright white ball of light flying through local area.;2008-09-17 23:00:00;5 - 10 Seconds;Large bright white ball of light flying through local area. I was taking a walk in my neighborhood and looked into the sky and saw a rather large bright ball of light. The ball of light was moving slowly through the clear night sky at about the speed and height you would see a normal aircraft move. The ball only stayed at this speed for a few seconds and began to accelerate and instantly shot off and disappeared into the night sky.  There were no clouds in the area for the light to go behind and there was no mistaking this for an airplane.  Like I said the movement the ball made when it disappeared into the sky was instantaneous.    I proceeded to call a friend five to ten minutes later when I reached my house and decided to walk back outside.   Just as I was describing the ball of light over the phone it returned with the great speed it had left with.  The ball of light had shot back into the nearby sky and began to hover for a few moments in a circular motion. I then grew tired and watching the object and went inside to report the sighting.  I am 21 years old and a junior in college and have lived in this neighborhood for almost my entire life.;34.3128800120058;-83.8343698079261
