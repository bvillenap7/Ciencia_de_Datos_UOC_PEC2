TRIANGULAR FORMATION OF LIGHTS MAKING A 90 DEGREE CHANGE IN COURSE THEN TRAVELING N. ((anonymous report));2017-12-31 19:05:00;60 seconds;TRIANGULAR FORMATION OF LIGHTS MAKING A 90 DEGREE CHANGE IN COURSE THEN TRAVELING NORTHBOUND NEAR GAINESVILLE, GA ON SUNDAY 12/31/2017 WHILE DRIVING SOUTHBOUND ON I-985 JUST NORTH OF GAINESVILLE, GA AT APPROXIMATELY 19:05 HOURS, MY WIFE & I WITNESSED AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT MOVING FROM WEST TO EAST IN A DIRECTION THAT WAS PERPENDICULAR TO OUR COURSE.  THERE WAS NO BEAM OF LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE SOURCE, JUST THE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT WHICH APPEARED TO BE TALLER THAN IT WAS WIDE NOT A RECTANGLE, BUT ROUGHLY THAT PRIMARY SHAPE. THE LIGHT WAS AS BRIGHT AS THE LIGHT GENERATED IN A LIGHTNING BOLT. AFTER TEN SECONDS THE LIGHT CHANGED DIRECTION NINETY DEGREES SUCH THAT IT WAS MOVING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH & DIRECTLY TOWARD OUR COURSE ON I-985 SOUTHBOUND. AS THE LIGHT MOVED VIRTUALLY OVERHEAD, IT BECAME OBSCURED (OR DISAPPEARED) & A TRIANGULAR FORMATION OF CIRCULAR LIGHTS, DARK GOLD IN COLOR, BECAME VISIBLE. THE LIGHTS WERE ONLY AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE TRIANGULAR SHAPE. NO NOISE OR SOUND WAS HEARD. MY APPROXIMATION OF THE ELEVATION IS NO MORE THAN 1000 FEET. MY ESTIMATION OF THE SIZE OF THE TRIANGULAR LIGHT FORMATION IS BETWEEN 75 & 100 FEET WIDE AT THE BACK END OF THE TRIANGLE 200+ FEET ON THE SIDES TO A POINT IN FRONT. MY ROUGH ESTIMATION OF THE SPEED THAT THE FORMATION WAS MOVING IS LESS THAN 50 MPH. THE LIGHTS WERE NOT RIGHT UP AGAINST EACH OTHER, BUT HAD AN EVEN AMOUNT OF SPACE BETWEEN THEM.;34.3128800120058;-83.8343698079261
