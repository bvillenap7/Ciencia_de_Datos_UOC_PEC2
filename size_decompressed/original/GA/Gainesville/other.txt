They were extremely bright, flashing almost strobe like back and forth from blue oneastern sider of craft to red on western side.  About 5 smaller bright/white flashers in between.  No sound, appeared very large, but was dark so can't be sure.  As craft passed over head, going due south the rear end had two very bright white flashing strobe lights - pulsing about every 1/2 second.  My guess it was oblong, oval, sort of like Hans Solo's craft in 1st starwars ??? This went deliberately north to south, no sound whatsoever.;34.3128800120058;-83.8343698079261
One object with bright white lights remained still for about thirty minuts;2016-11-22 07:00:00;30 minutes+;one object with bright white lights remained still for about thirty minuts One brightly lite object was seen in the western sky.  The lights were too bright to tell the shape.It stayed in one position for about thirty minutes, until it  was too cold to remain outside and watch.  The lights on the object would go dim and at times disappear then reappear.  After one hour it was gone.  My husband said that was a real one wasn't it?  The same object appeared on 11/24/16 in the same area and stayed for about one hour, until finally moving westward out of site.;34.3128800120058;-83.8343698079261
