Caught a UFO object in a photo.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a bird in flight.  PD));2008-07-04 15:00:00;Don't know;Caught a UFO object in a photo During the summer, I was walking up my street just taking some random photos. There was an empty for-sale house on my street and the sun was above it, behind some trees, so I thought it would make a good picture. I snapped a few photos and moved down and then went back inside. I downloaded my pics onto my laptop. I noticed as I was looking at one that it looked like a UFO in the top right corner. ( I will email the picture). The other photos I took didn’t contain the object. I think it looked like a flying saucer…there was no one outside that day and the house was empty at the time, and there is nothing but miles of woods behind the houses, so it wasn’t a Frisbee. I don’t think it was a spec or dust particle because I think I wiped my camera lense off before taking pictures. And if it was, the spec wouldn’t appear like that on the photo. The object is blurred, so obviously, it was moving fast. Although I don’t believe it is a bird, it very well could be. I really want some second opinions on my photo. It was taken with a Nikon CoolPix L14 7 megapixel digital camera. I don’t remember the exact time but it was on July 7th. I didn’t see the object in the sky when or before I took the picture and I never saw any birds flying by. What do you think? Please take a look at the photo in the email! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  Object in photo is a tiny, blurry, indistinct object, located in the upper right part of the photo.  The shape of the object suggests to us that it is a bird in flight.  PD));34.3128800120058;-83.8343698079261
Disk or saucer shaped craft with amazing bright lights on it which lit up the sky and the side of my home in Georgia.;2011-10-16 11:40:00;30 minutes;Disk or saucer shaped craft with amazing bright lights on it which lit up the sky and the side of my home in Georgia. Background of Observer:  Legal Services/Sales  This past Sunday evening, October 16, 2011, it was somewhere around 11:40 p.m.  I was sitting on my back deck.  I had gone inside for a minute, and when I came back out I saw this amazing bright light in the sky to the north, maybe a little northwest of my home.  It was your typical looking UFO from what I see in pictures, not triangular like some describe, but more like disk or saucer shaped.  Inside of it were what appeared to be 8 to maybe 10 round super bright lights shining.  It hovered in the sky for a little bit, with an amazing haze of light around it and these round bright lights shining, all white, I did not see any color.  There was no sound. It then appeared to be coming closer toward me, would hover there for a few minutes and then retreat back to where it originally was.  It did this several times.  I called a friend and was describing it to them.  This went on for about 25-30 minutes.  And it just disappeared, retreated the last time and was gone!  I have no idea what cows and aliens have to do with one another, other than the things I have read about them doing surgical procedures on cows and other such gross things I have read and seen on the internet.  But I do have a pasture with cows and horses just at the back of my property line, to the west of my home. I have 3 dogs that I made go inside while I sat out and watched it.  I took a picture with my 3G iPhone, which has no flash.  That's really about all I can describe about what transpired.  I have lived in my house for over 6 years and have never seen there, nor anywhere else in my life, such a thing as amazing as this.;34.3128800120058;-83.8343698079261
ENORMOUS disc-shaped UFO with band of lights spotted 5/6/21 at 22:40 hovering over Lake Lanier (Gainesville, GA);2021-05-06 22:40:00;5 min;ENORMOUS disc-shaped UFO with band of lights spotted 5/6/21 at 22:40 hovering over Lake Lanier (Gainesville, GA) On Thursday, May 6, 2020, my friend and I were fishing on Lake Lanier near Brown’s Bridge at about 10:40pm on a cloudy evening. We began to see a series of lights passing over in the clouds across the water a good distance from where we were tied down.  I started filming so I could zoom in to see what they were. Suddenly the clouds parted a bit and we could see it was not a series of lighted separate objects, but rather a series of lights around a huge disk-shaped object that was hovering in place. It had one light on the top and a series of lights rotating around the outermost edge. The scale of the object was enormous, particularly given that it was above the furthest edge of the lake from us, all the way across the Chestatee Bay.  I got a text that disrupted my filming, and I looked down at my phone to start it again, but the clouds closed up again and it then disappeared.;34.3128800120058;-83.8343698079261
