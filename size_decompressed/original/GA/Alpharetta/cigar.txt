Cigar shaped object shrouded  with amber flames/haze over North Atlanta on July 4th, 2010.;2010-07-04 23:08:00;2 minutes;Cigar shaped object shrouded  with amber flames/haze over North Atlanta on July 4th, 2010. At approx. 11:07 PM, our group was gathered outside in my townhome parking lot after a fireworks show.  I noticed one object in the sky moving southeast to northwest at a very low rate of speed.  I am not schooled in aviation, but the object appeared to be moving far below the normal altitude of the everyday commercial and miltary flights that are frequent over my location, for Hartsfield Airport and Dobbins AFB. It resembled a cigar shape/zeppelin,  It made no sound and appeared to have no running lights on the underside, but looked like the top was either on fire or illuminated with an amber-orange haze that surrounded the top half.  It made no deviations in its flight path. I am an amateur astronomer spending many nights with my eye on the sky and this object does not correspond to anything I have ever encountered.  The event was witnessed by at least 7 people in my group.;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
