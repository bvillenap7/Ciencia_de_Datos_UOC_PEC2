Tarnished bronze sphere hovering in close proximity to a radio tower;2003-10-29 17:45:00;30 secods;Tarnished bronze sphere hovering in close proximity to a radio tower I was travelling NNW on Old Alabama Connector toward Mansell Road.  I was stopped at that intersection and was looking NNW over the North Point Mall toward the horizon.  On the horizon are two towers, a cell tower to the left and a radio tower just north of it.  I noticed what I thought was a globe on one of the guide wires, similar to the globes that are sometimes placed on high tension wires to prevent them from touching each other during high wind conditions.  I paused because this seemed unusual, but at that point, the traffic light changed and I had to continue driving.  Later upon reflection I realized that the size was completely off, and that the sphere was actually about 3 times the width of the radio tower.  It was approximately 1/2 of the way up the tower and about the same distance from the tower to the east.  The color of the sphere was tarnished bronze, bronze tarnished almost to the point of being brown.  It was motionless while it was under my observation.  I went back later to verify that my perception was correct and the sphere was no longer there.  I am certain that the sphere was not a tethered baloon of some type.;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
White Sphere flying below and at right ange to an airliner.;2004-05-06 09:52:00;20 seconds;White Sphere flying below and at right ange to an airliner. Glanced out the window of my office and observed a white sphere passing below and at a right angle to a commercial jet.  The jet was at cruising altitude and heading from the SE to the NW.    The sphere was heading from the SW to the NE.  It looked like it was several thousand feet below the airliner and travelling at about the same speed.  The jet was leaving a short contrail, but the sphere was not.  I continued to observe the sphere until it disappeared into the distance.;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
About a dozen silent pulsating reddish-orange orbs in the sky;2012-06-05 21:35:00;3 minutes;About a dozen silent pulsating reddish-orange orbs in the sky When we first noticed them, there were between 8 and 12 pulsating reddish-orange lights in the sky, moving slowly and silently to the northwest.   The pulsation from brightest to dimmest did not seem to have an particular pattern.   Some would pulsate once per 3 seconds and others would seem to stay bright, making them all seem to have their own brightness at any given time.  This could be due to cloud obscuration, but the sky was clear, for the most part, in the direction I was looking.  The lights appeared to gain in elevation, as well.   Then the lights began &quotwinking out&quot a few at a time, and before I was able to get my video camera going, there were only three left, and they quickly disappeared.  I managed to capture the three remaining lights on my video camera, just before they disappeared...about 30 seconds of footage. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Please see video posted to the NUFORC homepage, taken by witness.  We express our gratitude to the witness for sharing the video.  ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport,   I did some research on the wind data for the time period of my sighting.  I checked several stations in the general area and they all reported minimal wind (between 0 and 4 mph), all in an easterly direction, during that time period.  Most of the graphs looked like the image I've attached, named winds_06_05_2012.jpg.  The jet stream image I've attached also indicates this easterly direction.  I've attached the closest data point to the hour in which I reported the sighting (adjusted for UTC timezone).  However, the data for the hours before and after showed pretty much the same thing: the wind was minimal (between 0 and 60 knots), going in the same easterly direction.   From the video, you can tell there was not much wind where I was standing.  I am pretty sure the direction in which my camera was pointing was almost due south (I will validate this with a compass, as soon as I find one).  From the video, using the tree top as a static reference, you can see the lights moving to my right.  This would indicate the lights were moving, at least to some degree, to the west (against the direction of the wind).  I hope this helps. ((END ADDENDUM));34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
While driving up GA 400 heading N, above the tree line I seen a orb that just hovered there for 2-5 min..;2017-07-16 19:00:00;2-3 minutes;While driving up GA 400, heading north, above the tree line, I seen a orb that just hovered there for 2-5 min after the curvature of the road cause me to loose site of it I didn't give it much thought but after the road realigned so I could view it again.  It was still there and in two blinks it shot off and disappeared.  It was not a balloon or drone.   I worked in the USAF and can recognize object in the sky very easily. this was nothing I've seen before.;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
Very fast sphere of light falling out of sky and travelled south and disappeared behind tree line.;2017-11-25 00:32:00;1 minute;Very fast sphere of light falling out of sky and travelled south and disappeared behind tree line. Bright spherical light seemed to drop out of the sky above a tree line and then abruptly made a 90Â° direction change to flying south.   All happened in a matter of a second or 2, and then disappeared as it bolted away.;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
