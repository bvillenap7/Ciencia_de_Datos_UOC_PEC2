A boomerang shape that disappeared in the night sky;2007-02-16 20:00:00;20 seconds;A boomerang shape that disappeared in the night sky I was sitting with my sister on the back porch of her apartment about 8 in the evening.  She pointed to the sky and said look at those birds.  But as we looked we realized that those were not birds because the formation was wrong and there was a light coming from them.   They clustered together in a boomerang shape but we could tell there were about 50 individual lights to the cluster.   As it headed towards us from the North West area it started to gracefully arch towards the North and broke into a triple arch shape and disappeared.  It was something we have never seen before!  We are both very logically people I am a college advisor and she is a fashion designer.   We wanted to report this because it was unbelievable!;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
