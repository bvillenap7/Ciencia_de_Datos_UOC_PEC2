Tiny white light spec during sunrise;2021-05-27 06:46:00;20 seconds;Tiny white light spec during sunrise Date: 05/27/21 Time: 06:46 AM Location: Cogburn Road Park, 12825 Cogburn Road, Alpharetta, GA 30004 U.S.A. Direction: East Conditions: Clear sunrise, with light cloud canopy Circumstance: While capturing a photograph of the sunrise with an iPhone 12 a small white light was captured near the center of the photograph. At the time, the phenomenon was not directly observed by me. Rather, when I looked at the photographs, (6 were taken), I noticed an odd white light in the image and zoomed into the photo to see what it was. Each of the 6 photos show a slightly different image of the phenomenon. The raw image photographs were transferred to a computer and further examined at high resolution. The point of light turned out to be a series of lights forming a partial circle around a center light. No visible object around the lights can be observed. Also, there are approximately 7 lights arranged in two pairs, around a center with another light along the circumference, and another light showing movement away from the concentric circle cluster.  Evidence: Six iPhone photographs captured in Apple’s “RAW” HEIC camera mode which can be processed and saved as JPG, PNG, TIF, or other file formats. Note, the camera RAW image is an unprocessed file and therefore, provides the most accurate image capture of the object. RAW Image Size: 4032 x 3024, 8Bit, RGB, 72ppi.
