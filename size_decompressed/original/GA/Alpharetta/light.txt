Three strange lights moving irregularly close together and at high speed.;2007-08-14 10:10:00;2 min;Three strange lights moving irregularly close together and at high speed. Facing west, we noticed three dots of light traveling in a triangular formation at very high speed and very close together. I compared their speed to obvious planes moving in other areas of the sky. They were not flashing, but rather constant. All three lights were traveling from north to south about four feet off the horizon moving into the horizon more than across it. The peculiar thing is that the lights seemed to be kind of weaving instead of moving in a straight line-very odd movement. I have never seen anything like it. After about 30 seconds and grabbing my brother from inside to take a look, they disappeared. My guess was that they were too high and as they got closer to the horizon we lost them in the light, but it seemed really abrupt. As we stood there dumbfounded, there appeared another light with a smaller, fainter red light traveling right next to it. These two traveled along the same line as the first three and at the same speed. They also moved in the same strange way-not in a straight line, but more like in a wave. I have to say that it gave me chills!;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
Orange lights, smoke or fog.;2009-09-20 03:56:00;5 Minutes (apporx);Orange lights, smoke or fog. At 3:56AM I woke up and glanced at the digital clock on the night stand.  I picked up the remote and clicked on headline news and propped my head up on two pillows.  My patio faces a southern direction.  There is glass paned door onto the patio off of the master bedroom to the left of the bed.  Looking at the television, the door is reflected in the mirror on my dresser.  The weather had been stormy but was quiet at this time.  Directly behind my home there is a small protected wetland.  While watching the news I became aware of a bright orange light, past the patio, illuminating the glass panes on the door.  I first saw it through the reflection on the mirror.  I turned and looked at the door and could see it at an angle through the door as well.  I looked back toward the mirror as the view was more directly at the door and saw clouds of smog or fog drift in front of the orange light.  Both the light and the smoke disappeared briefly and then only the light reappeared for a few seconds and then it was dark as if nothing had happened.  At no time was there any sensation of heat and there was no sound.  The smoke/fog first moved upward, and then from left to right.  I have never seen or experienced anything like this.  I did not feel fear.  I thought to myself that it might be a premonition of a fire but the dismissed the thought. Oddly at one point I thought I should get up and look out - but then decided I didn't need to worry about it.  Very strange.  This morning there was nothing outside that looked amiss.  An internet search did not find any others reporting a similiar incident at the same time although there was a rocket on the east coast that caused some odd lights, but that is too far from me to be related.  There did seem to be a pattern of orange lights and crafts reported in this state.  While I have no idea what this actually was, I feel compelled to report it somewhere, that it may be important.

I saw a glowing, red object fly through the sky, slowly headed in a SE, then E direction.;2010-05-02 20:00:00;about 1 minute;I saw a glowing, red object fly through the sky, slowly headed in a SE, then E direction. I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  After I finished smoking my cigarette, I decided that it was nice enough out to merit staying out there.  I decided to lie on top of my car and look up at the sky to watch the clouds pass by.  I sat there for about a minute before a saw a red light out of the corner of my eye. It grabbed my attention so i sat up to get a better look. At first, I dismissed it to just being a plane I see a couple pass pay each day.  Then, as I continued to watch it I realized it couldn't have been a plane because the entire object was red, almost glowing like a light.  Then, I tried to say it was a a meteor, or some type of fireball, or a flare but there was no trail of smoke left behind, nor was there a tail on the object.  It was just an glowing, oblong figure. It flew at a relatively constant speed a little too slow for a plane, though.  It was high enough so that it was above some clouds, but below others. When I initally saw it, it was fl! ying from the north-west and headed towards the south-east.  However, I lost this figure behind the clouds for a moment and when I regained sight of it, it appeared to be headed east at least a 30 degree change in flight path. I lost it beyond the horizon shortly after. I'm reluctant to call it a UFO just because I like facts and tangible proof.  I wasn't able to clearly see this object, nor was I up close to it.  The I'm posting this report now is because it seems as though there is no other explanation. When there are planes flying overhead, I hear noise.   There was no noise. It was too bright for there to be stars out.  Plus, it was much to large and oddly shaped for it to be a star.  It was moving too slowly to be a meteor or a fireball.  And, there was no trail of smoke as there would be with a flare. As much as my logical, fact-based mind hates to admit it, I think this could have been a UFO. The thing that really made me post this report, though, is perhaps the most unsettling thing. I came inside to research what it might have been and all that kept appearing in my search results were links to people talking about UFOs. I ended up on this website and decided to look at what other sightings have happened in my state. I came across a report in which the poster said they were on States Bridge Rd. near a subdivision named Double Gate. By car, I live not even 5 minutes away from that subdivision.;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
Slow moving, steady, bright orange light flew over and disappeared.;2012-08-25 23:00:00;3 minutes;Slow moving, steady, bright orange light flew over and disappeared. A steady orange light made its way across the sky.  Relatively low.  Flying at about the same height as most planes that fly over.  Absolutely no engine sounds heard.  As it flew over the house it disappeared all of a sudden.  No tail or smoke trails typical of meteors or aircraft.  Flying far to slow to be any type of aircraft.  Only a single, bright orange light.  No blinking or pulsating.  Very strange.  Never seen anything like it in my entire life.;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
Green light n Southern Sky.;2014-04-23 21:00:00;4-8 seconds;Green light n Southern Sky I was riding in the passenger seat of the other witness' vehicle driving South on Main Street about 2 miles north of Old Milton.   It had green lights, one main elongated light (the shape of an eclair) and several surrounding lights all bright green much like a glow worm in adult state.  We witnessed the lights in the southern sky around the time of 2100 hours.   It made an accelerated falling motion, from my peripheral top right to the center of my range of sight facing ahead, at an eighty degree angle and slowed to a stop for half a second.  It then immediately changed directions and either blinked out of sight or accelerated at a rate so fast that it appeared to teleport away.   Immediately after this event, I saw multiple human aircraft taking off towards the same direction.;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
2 lights flying with abnormal way, similar to an insect;2016-02-29 01:46:00;10 seconds;I just went to my backyard and watched 2 lights flying with abnormal way, similar to an insect, one behind the other.   No sound and so fast!  WoW!!!!;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
