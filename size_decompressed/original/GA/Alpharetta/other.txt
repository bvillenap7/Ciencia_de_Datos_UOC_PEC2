Incredibil fast lights.....;2005-12-24 12:15:00;2 minutes;Incredibil fast lights..... I've seen  3 bright lights on the sky that were flying around, moving very fast.  The speed that they were moving must've been incredebil takeing in consideration the distance and the altitude these objects were flying.  I like to watch the plains flying on the sky and I know that for the eye they seem to be very slow and in the same time I know they are flying with the speed of 550-600 miles per hour. These objects were 15-20 times faster then any airplane and were doing 180 degrees manovers from left to right and from right to left. I don't even know if I can call them objects because all I've seen was just very bright, shiny, silvery lights or maybe reflections of light. I don't know what I saw but I know that what I saw can't be human unless the technology has developed to a level that is unknown to me or the rest of the world.;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
Boomerang shaped object, completely white, hovering in the sky;2017-12-27 07:45:00;2 minutes;Boomerang shaped object, completely white, hovering in the sky Hello, I did not know about there was a place to officially report these sightings or else I would have done this sooner. I was on my way to work in the morning, and it was winter, 2 days after Christmas.  The trees were bare and the sky was clear with no clouds, so I was able to see fairly far.  I saw in the air, some distance away, a boomerang shaped object and the ends were facing downwards, so it could even be described as an upside down ‘U’.  It was completely white, but since it was in the open sky, I have no frame of reference for how large it was. I did my best to keep my eye on it, but since I was driving I could not take a picture.  The object did not move and just hovered in the sky.  After about 10-15 seconds, I had to take my eyes completely off of the object to go thru a roundabout circle on the road, but when I looked up again it was gone. I kept looking and as I proceeded down the road, I saw it again but it had moved a very large distance away within the 5-10 seconds that I had lost it.  The ends of the U were still facing down and it was hovering again, without moving.  I was able to keep my eyes on it for another 5 seconds or so and then lost it again.  I was not able to find it after that.;34.0726751515153;-84.2775270707074
