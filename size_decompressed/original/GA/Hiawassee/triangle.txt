Hovering Black Triangle;1990-01-15 12:30:00;1 minute;Hovering Black Triangle Driving down the road, I spotted a dark object hovering above the tree line just over 1/2 a mile away.  As I got closer it still hadn't moved I was going around 40 miles a hr so this took at least a min.  When I ended up in front of it I could see clearly that it was a black triangle about 100 yrds off the road and just above the trees.   I stopped for just a second and saw that it was about 40ft across the back and maybe 30 ft from front to back but maybe only 8ft tall if that.you could see the outline of lights in the corners but they were not on and there was no sound at all.  I went on pass it 1/10th of a mile and stopped on a bridge and got out to look back and it wasnt no where in sight.  Since then Ive seen 1 more on Jan 29 of this year.  A bright light coming down the same ridge at midnight.  Set my cellphone on camera looked up and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
