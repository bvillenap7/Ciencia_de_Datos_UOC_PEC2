It would change locations, when looking through the binoculars it appeared to have 4 lights with beam coming down.   Also, when looking through the binoculars, the object had a light trail following it.   I was far away over another mountain and had a red light that would flash on top for brief periods of time.   It disappeared and about 4 plans were fly in the area!   Very interesting experience.;34.9056;-83.7319
