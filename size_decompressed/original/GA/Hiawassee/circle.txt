They were orange like and very bright lthat seemed to move in all concentric motions.  They were right over the National forest where no one lives, it's a wooded area.   We have never seen anything like this!   They seemed to be forming triangles.  The lights were amazing!   We did not hear any noise coming from that area.   We would say they were 5000 ft high.  It was really cool!;34.9056;-83.7319
