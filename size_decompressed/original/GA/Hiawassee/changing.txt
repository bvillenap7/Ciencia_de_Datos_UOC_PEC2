Dark object or Aircraft that has the ability to change or shift-shape.;2018-07-05 18:55:00;10 minutes;Dark object or Aircraft that has the ability to change or &quotshift-shape&quot My wife and I observed the craft for approximately 10 minutes.  I was able to view the craft with binoculars and observed the crafts ability to shift its shape.  I personally do not believe that this was a drone being that I operated drones both as a hobby and professionally.  This was the first sighting of an object that I could not identify in my lifetime.   I’ve worked around aircraft for several years now at Atlanta’s Hartsfield Jackson International Airport and feel that I’m familiar with how most aircraft operate.  This craft appeared to be static but also appeared to have control of itself which leads me to believe that it was not any type of weather balloon.  I was able to snap a few pictures with a cell phone camera for what it’s worth.;34.9056;-83.7319
