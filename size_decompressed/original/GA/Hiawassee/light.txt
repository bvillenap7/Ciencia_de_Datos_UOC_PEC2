SPEEDING LIGHT ACROSS THE SKY;2009-11-30 03:00:00;30 minutes;SPEEDING LIGHT ACROSS THE SKY I let my dogs out of the house and walked to the North end of my front porch. The night was clear and very cold. I had a clear view of the sky. A light caught my attention since it appeared to be a shooting star with it's light trail. This shooting star came to a complete stop. It was motionless for about 20 seconds and sped off in a verticle climb and stopped again. It continued to speed off in different directions, leaving a light path as it did, and would come to a complete stop, wait for 20 to 30 seconds and speed of again. The distance was extreme which made the speed with which it moved incredible. The show continued for about 30 minutes and I had to return inside due to the cold.
