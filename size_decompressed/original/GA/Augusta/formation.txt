I noticed the lights in the sky while at the corner of Kissingbower Rd. and Walden Dr.  There were two distinct lights that blinked off and on then disappeared completely.  As I stopped at a store a on Deans Bridge Rd. I saw them again.  This time there were 3 lights in a formation that disappeared on by one.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
