((HOAX??))  Quad-chopper sighting, perfect straight path for aprox 6-8 miles.;2014-02-19 11:00:00;15 minutes;Quad-chopper sighting, perfect straight path for aprox 6-8 miles, Was looking out the window of Medical College of Georgia hospital what I believe was around 11:00 AM.   I saw a quad-chopper (looks like the drones Amazon wants to use for delivering packages) fly over the south wing at about 200-300 feet in the air and head north-east.   It kept a perfect straight path with what seemed to be about 30-40 MPH for about 10 minutes.  Stayed straight until it went out of view range.
