Flasing triangular lights in rural Georgia;2008-04-16 12:45:00;10 seconds;Flasing triangular lights in rural Georgia    On I-20W I was driving heading towards Atlanta. I had just stopped in Augusta to get gas  at least 15 minutes before. I saw deer and put on my high beams in order to spot them in the road. After driving 15 minutes I saw a triangular shape on the opposite side of the road facing me. It flashed its lights (which were under the aircraft) and then it was darkness for about 2 seconds. Then it flashed its lights again and I got a clearer look at it. The Aircraft was hovering over the tree on the opposite side and it seemed to standing still. The aircraft appeared to be very high tech and it made no noise as I passed. I didn't fear at all I just kept driving but I knew it was not from here.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
Triangle of moderately bright white lights;2012-01-18 23:05:00;1 minute;Triangle of moderately bright white lights Light that got larger, brighter than airplanes have been, at first looked like a planet, but it the light rapidly got closer in a very short timeframe.  The light seemed to turn into a triangle as it got closer, and it stayed static in one place long enough for others to exit home and see it, but rapidly, and fluidly, exited line of sight laterally across the sky, which was seen by me and 2 other adults.

Three bright lights appear in the shape of an equilateral triangle.;2012-01-24 19:18:00;about 1 minute;Three bright lights appear in the shape of an equilateral triangle. At approximately 7:18pm on January 24th, 2012 my mother and I were driving down Old Evans RD, towards Bobby Jones Hwy. We saw a stationary grouping of lights (larger and brighter than stars) in the area of sky on our right side. The lights were in an equilateral triangle formation and not moving at all. After only a few moments, perhaps 45 seconds, one of the lights went away it appeared to have been turned off.  It reminded me of how a bulb still glows slightly for a split second once it has been shut off.  After about 5 seconds, the remaining two lights went out at the exact same time (and in the same slow manner). The lights were not seen again. bright flash in bellingham area. A flash of light lit my whole house. My dog freaked out.  At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out aswell.  I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.  I have never seen a UFO and don't nessasarly beleive in them, but I can not think of another explaination.  My girlfriend has witnessed a similar occurance.  Winter lighting??? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I saw three bright white lights hovering in the same spot in a triangle formation.;2014-03-03 21:00:00;15 seconds;I saw three bright white lights hovering in the same spot in a triangle formation. I was in the passenger set of my car as we were driving north bound down Boy Scout Rd.   To the left of my car I saw three bright white lights in a triangular formation.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but there was little to no motion.  The lights just hovered in place, keeping a triangular formation.   We kept driving but I could see the lights still in the same spot behind us.  Unfortunately, we drove far enough that I could not get another look at the lights.

Black triangle with white lights at corners hovering over Furys Ferry Road in Augusta, Ga.;2015-02-21 19:30:00;2-3 minutes;Black triangle with white lights at corners hovering over Furys Ferry Road in Augusta, Ga. Driving home from dinner with my wife and son, saw two bright white lights maybe 500 feet off the ground ahead of us.  I asked my wife what she thought and she said new cell tower.  I said they normally had red lights not white and we continued to watch.   As we got underneath it, we could see it was a dark triangle with bright white lights at the corners and a small blinking red light in the middle.  It was hovering just over to the side of the road, not moving, not making any sound.   I slowed down and watched it, it seemed to be tilting as I watched.  There was a median so I couldnt turn around right away, came back at it from the other direction less than a minute later and it had sped off, quickly heading north, if I'm not mistaken.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998

Triangular-ish shaped thing in the sky with white and red blinking lights, really big, almost silent;2020-10-15 19:50:00;1 minute;Triangular-ish shaped thing in the sky with white and red blinking lights, really big, almost silent I was driving down the road and saw this thing in the sky. It was dark outside It was almost silent, and huge. I think it had three white lights that blinked, along with two red lights that also blinked,but not in any particular pattern. It was really hard to make out the shape, but it looked like triangular/boomerang-ish. It went the opposite direction of where i was headed, and it was like once it got across the street, it went to the right real fast. The light I was sitting at changed green, so I didn't see much else of it afterwards.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
