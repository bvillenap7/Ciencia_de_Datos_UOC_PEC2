Silver cigar shaped object crosses Augusta, Ga, sky silently around 7:15am 11/5/2013;2013-11-05 07:15:00;5 minutes;Silver cigar shaped object crosses Augusta Ga sky silentlyb around 7:15 am 11/5/2013 While outside taking snapshots of the morning sky, I had seen a silver cigar shaped object in the eastern sky, no sound emitted, cross the sky from east to west keeping same altitude, estimated altitude around 25,000 to 30,000 feet.  The object was moving at the same speed during this sighting am guessing around 300 to 400 nmph. This object also gave sun reflection as it passed overhead, no sound whatsoever, then the object continued its westerly direction at same speed until disappearing from sight all while I was attempting to film this sighting. The filming showed nothing but the blue morning sky according to the first playback, my zoom was not on at the time though I had thought it was, my zoom only goes 4x, when I realized it was off, I had turned it on and set it to max, by then the object had traveled moreso to the west therefore a dot may appear once enhanced.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
