And noticed a fireball similar to the one I witnessed in Pittsburgh.  And as I reported it to my drill sargent, he thought I was a lunatic.  Then, just about 10 meters outside his tent I viewed an object stealthily coming above me.  It would stop directly over my head, as if it were observing me, and I would stand there just looking back at it.  Originally, it had lights on, and I stood ther just looking and thinking.   I was armed and never once did I think of shooting at the object.  For me it was all time had stood still for this brief moment.  The object turned it's lights off and stayed hovering above the trees and me for a few more seconds and then it just suddenly took off at a speed unimaginable.  Then, i didn't understand it, but today I would consider it a blessing, to view these objects.  And I would live all these years never forgetting.  The siting in Pgh. and in Ga are just two of many I would go on to witness..  My next siting would occur in Texas, some time later, at Lake Belton, in Belton County, TX.  This siting was a cigar shaped object and looked like a lit up bus.  There was no sound as it passed over head.  Then, as with now there was no known technology, that could explain these events. I know, firsthand, because I was in the Military Intelligence community at the time and viewed all known Strategic Initiative Technologies, under the then Jimmy Carter, (Carter) Administration.  I would then and now still look to the skies, for more events i have witnessed in my youth. In Georgia the shape was a fireball at first.  And upon my closer encounter, it was rectangular in shape.  It had lights brighter than the new halogen lights of today.  And when i first haeard of the new stealth bomber, i looked forward to seeing it's shape.  i felt it wpould maybe appear to be the rectangular shape I had witnessed earlier in my life, but it wasn't.  And I would imagine that the lights that folded into the craft I had witnessed in Georgia, were not there on the stealh bomber.  Rodriguez was from America, probably from the western half of it then.  Where he might be today is unknown to me.  I'm sure he never forgot this night, in GA, either.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
Silent black rectangle flying over highway Augusta, GA;2009-08-05 05:45:00;30 seconds;Silent black rectangle flying over highway Augusta, GA I was driving to work this morning traveling west on I-20.  It was about 5:45 and it was still dark, but the sky was a monarch blue color before the sunrise, so it was not completely dark. I was between Washington Rd and Bobby Jones exits when I saw a dark shape in the sky flying at about 2 o'clock to the right of my car.  It zig-zagged and started coming toward the highway. I thought...wow! That is a huge bird!...and by the time that it got over the highway, I thought that it might be a helicopter, but it had no tail and no propellers.  It had no lights and was completely silent. It got close enough for me to tell that it was black and looked like a rectangular pod of some sort and definitely mechanical-looking. I could see side pipes and what might look like vents on it.  Although it was difficult to tell just how high it was, it was not too high...as I looked to the left over my shoulder as I saw it go across me over the highway, it looked like it just skirted the tree line before it disappeared.  I was not scared, but had a car behind me and I did have to be careful, because I did not want to run my car off the road.  If it was a plane or a helicopter, it would have had lights.  Due to the low altitude, if it had been either of those, I would have heard it.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998

With dim lights hover about 20 seconds and then just drop down behind.  A huge pine tree. It made no noise.  it just disappeared.
