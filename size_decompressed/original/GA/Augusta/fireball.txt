I'm in my late twenties, with a solid career and a family, so it feels strange to relay this account of a UFO. But upon exploring your database, I was prompted to. My mom, brother, sister, a friend and myself were coming home from a football game one evening. My mom, who was driving, suddenly stopped the car in the middle of the street we were on and just stared up and out of the windshield. I remember her saying what is that? and pointing. I got out of the car immediately and looked toward where she was pointing. They were impossible to miss. Three round objects hovered perfectly still in the form of a triangle. They appeared to be burning but there was no heat or cast-off light or even any noise. I guess their color was something like red-orange. We finally drove down the street to get a camera and tell my dad about the objects but they were gone when we looked for them again.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
whole city witnesses falling light (not meteror, nor plane distress flare);2004-03-02 09:00:00;unknown;whole city witnesses falling light (not meteor, nor plane distress flare) I wasnt actually a witness but its been on the news and radio for 3 days straight and they said no one reported it so i will. they said it was a falling light that ressembled a plane distress flare but after investigation authorities found out that no plane launched a flare nor distress signal.  then people said that the light crashed in phinizy swamp, when authorities investigated the area with infrared helicopters and other means nothing turn up. But the whole city made calls in that night seeing the falling light over the city of Augusta;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
7 flying bright orange balls of light on the sky at 9:20 PM.;2014-03-19 21:20:00;30 minutes with breaks;7 flying bright orange balls of light on the sky at 9:20 PM. Me and my friend were studying and then behind the window I noticed 7 objects moving around in different directions, they were kinda yellow/red, for sure not planes, they were blinking a little bit but they were bright and moved in very different directions and then disappeared.   We called our 2 other friends to come to our apartment.  Then we've seen 4 of the same objects in the different part of the sky, just staying close to each other, looked like formation.   After ten minutes we noticed two of them, just for 3 seconds.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
