One disc streaks in contacts another disc, both speed off.;2003-12-20 23:45:00;<5 mins;One disc streaks in contacts another disc, both speed off. Was driving down Gordon Hwy. going home, had just got off work. I spotted a disc moving very slowly across the sky. Then out of no where, I saw a bright green streak heading towards the disc.  I then realized the green streak was another disc. The green glow seem to spread out and vanish. The green disc then game to a dead stop and it seemed to send flashing signals to the first disc. They both moved in the same direction, then they just sped off in seperate directions, one looked like it was going straight up while the other disappeared off the horizon.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
