What was this? I've never seen anything like it in person.;2015-01-10 18:30:00;I don't know;What was this? I've never seen anything like it in person. I took my daughter to the mall shopping for her birthday coming up.  As we were leaving, my daughter pointed out a light in the sky and said, Hey mom, what is that?  Let it be known, I have never seen a UFO, though I have studied the phenomenon in depth.  My children are teens and are aware of this too.  We are always skywatching when we are out and about but don't take time out of our day to do this.   I'm always looking up due to what I know has been occurring around the world in increased frequency.   Anyway, it was far enough away to not be able to make out a true shape but very large.  It was not a star, it was not an airplane, it was not a tower, airport, anything like that.   I'm a huge skeptic so I went through all of the possibilities internally...nothing fit.  There was a smaller light that seem to be fading in and out and zooming into the craft and away again.  We decided to follow it.  It was only hovering at first but then it began to move slowly away. I finally found a dark road and have two pieces of footage.  The craft was further away from us at this point and began to change colors from green, red, blue.  The little light (possible craft) was still going away from it and going back in to it but at this point it was so far away it could have been a star.   At the mall, it was pretty clear and large.  Well clear enough to know it wasn't a star, satellite, or anything remotely close to what I've ever seen in the sky on earth.   It was hovering again on the second footage.   I would like to have this footage analyzed.  How can I get someone to do this?  I want to know what this was?;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
