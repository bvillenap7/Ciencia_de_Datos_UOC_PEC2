Lights in the sky;2002-09-17 20:30:00;over 3 hours;Lights in the sky Five points of light that where flying in and out of cloud cover at unbelievable angles and turns.  They were flying close to each other and making moves and turns I've never seen (or thought possible) by any kind of aircraft.  During accleration, they became brighter with a blue-white (exhaust-like) glow and dimmed when going slower.  The speeds and angles at which these things were moving was unbelievable.  They looked like dueling fireflies the way they speed and stopped and zipped around each other, almost as if they were chasing or performing acrobatic manuevers.  At one point, two flew into the cloud and the cloud lit up like an explosion (a bit like lightning), but there was no sound, no thunder. (It is now 11:30 pm here and the objects are still visible right now) ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the lights could have been caused by advertising lights.

High altitude bright strobing light moving at a very high rate of speed.;2002-10-03 06:00:00;>30 seconds;High altitude bright strobing light moving at a very high rate of speed. I was walking outside to get the morning paper, and I looked up to admire the stars in a clear sky. I saw a flash or light that appeared to be at a very high altitude. The light would flash rather brightly every 1-2 seconds, as the object moved across the sky at a very high rate of speed. The object flew in a straight path with no unnusual maneuvers. What really got my attention was the intensity of the light flashing, and the high rate of speed of the object. I am a licensed commercial pilot, and I am familiar with the flight characteristics of both civilian and military aircraft, and I am not familiar with any aircraft that can travel at that rate of speed. The flash of light was different than the high intensity strobes you see on aircraft. It was more like a yellowish/red pulse. The object was not visable between flashes, but it was amazing the distance that the object traveled between flashes. The object traveled from the west to the east, and the trees finally obscured my vision. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION))  Thank you for your interest. The object (light) was moving from the West to the East. The object appeared to travel in a straight path. The speed of this object makes me doubt that it was a satellite, or other debris in orbit. When I first saw the object as it flashed, I fixed my eyes towards that location as it disappeared. I was shocked to see it reappear much further away from where I had originally seen it. I have had two other unusual sightings in the past, so I am kind of keep an eye out for unusual activities in the sky. One of the sightings was in the 1980s when I used to fly a considerable amount. We were flying a Piper Navajo to Key west late in the afternoon and we witnessed an unknown craft of rather large proportions at 10000 feet. It was partially obscured by the clouds but seemed to be stationary. It was definitely not a Lenticular cloud. The sighting was very brief. The other sighting that I had was in 1997. I was traveling on Hwy 278 Near Savannah River Site in South Carolina when I saw a glowing object maneuver at low altitude at a slow steady speed, and abruptly shoot straight up into the sky. Again the sighting was very brief.  This about sums it up. Thank you for your attention. Regards,  ((name deleted)) ((END FOLLOW-UP));33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
Group of flashing rapidly moving lights;2006-04-08 23:00:00;few seconds;Group of flashing rapidly moving lights I have been seeing this for roughly a year. What happens is at certain times of the month several lights will appear, moving around the sky in unison and flash on and off while doing so. I have had several other people see it with me at times and they all agree with me that it seems like it is being flown in such a manor, definatly not stars or weather balloons or aircraft ( there are several airports in this area including one that has some military craft at it). I finally decided to file this in the hopes some else around here is seeing it.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
2 reddish/orange glowing objects in southwest sky, approximately 1500 feet above ground.;2006-04-11 20:40:00;@30 seconds;2 reddish/orange glowing objects in southwest sky, approximately 1500 feet above ground. I took a short break from my job in the designated break area. I was sitting at a picnic bench, when I saw one object fade in, glowing with a reddish/orange light, and a few seconds later, another glowing object appeared to the right and slightly lower to the first object. From my location, the objects were southwest from me. I noticed a co-worker staring in the same location, when I asked if she was seeing what I was looking at, and she confirmed that there was something there. The objects did not move, and after @ 30 seconds, the first object simply faded away, followed by the second object. The weather conditions were a clear sky, no wind, the sun was already beneath the horizon, and it was almost nightime.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
Star like light moving slow with some impossble movement.;2012-12-27 23:00:00;2 minutes;star like light moving slow with some impossble movement we saw a star like object move low and slow then it made 3 or 4 up and down movements that should be impossible for a aircraft. It laster looked to split into two lights but it was too far away for me to see it well after.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
Bright white star like light and smaller red light alternated fading and blinking out and on under ceiling of solid cloud cover.;2013-02-26 12:30:00;20 minutes;Bright white star like light and smaller red light alternated fading and blinking out and on under ceiling of solid cloud cover The sky was solid overcast 2/ 26/13 at 12:30 a.m. a bright white star-like light seen west of Augusta, GA.  No other stars, the moon, or objects in the sky were visible at this time.    It was seen for 20 minutes.  At first it was a single white light that was unmoving.  I thought it was an airplane but the light was in the same place for 10 minutes.   In the past plane lights would move into the landing pattern at either Bush Field or Daniel Field.   At that time a smaller red light was observed slightly south of the bright white light. The red light faded and blinked out then came on again. Just after that the larger white light faded and blinked out for 2 seconds and came on again.  The red light and white light repeated this two more times.  Then the red light blinked out and did not come back on.  The larger white light moved sharply up, down, left and right as if it were hopping or dancing.  Then stopped in prior position and was steady for another 2 minutes.   It faded off, came back on brighter than before, blinked out and then on two more times then faded out and was gone.  The observer has experience watching airplane traffic for 48 years.  The observer has been interested and an avid watcher of commercial and private aircraft, hot air balloons, meteorites and, meteor showers.  The observer is very familiar with the airport approach patterns in the Augusta, GA, area (Bush Field and Daniel Field).;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
Driving home on I-20, see really bright silver light/object in sky, seems motionless, look for a few seconds at it, then its gone.;2016-09-15 18:00:00;10 seconds;Driving home on I-20, see really bright silver light/object in sky, seems motionless, look for a few seconds at it, then its gone. Driving home on I-20 towards Atlanta.  Sun is still out.  As I'm about to cross over Washington Road on I20, I look to my left to check traffic on Washington road and up in the sky a really bright silver object/light catches my attention.  Such a bright silver color/light that I cant make out its shape.  I stare at it for atleast 3 seconds.   Traffic is busy on I20 heading home so I check the cars around me and in front of me.  I look back to where I saw the bright silver object/light and stare at it for another 3 or so seconds wondering ((what)) it is.  It's very high up in the sky.   I check all the cars around me once again but the third time, I go to look at the bright silver object/light, its gone. No clouds in the sky that day.  I've never seen a plane have sun light reflect off it so brightly during the day.  No clue what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Large white, red and blue blinking light that moved left to right back and forth, then blinked out.;2018-09-01 05:58:00;2-3 minutes;Large white, red and blue blinking light that moved left to right back and forth, then blinked out. I walked outside to let my dog out, and looked up at the sky while waiting for her.  I saw a rather large light.   I thought at first that it was a star, however it was too big for a star, and began blinking red and blue.  I thought then, that perhaps it was a plane, as that would not be uncommon.   However, the light began to move left to right, back and forth.  I attempted to grab my phone to record it, but my phone would not pick the image up.   It lasted 2-3 minutes and blinked out.  There was no more activity.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
