Leaving for home while driving by Daniel Village Airport, notice a object hovering above the south end of the air port. Est. this object was approximately two to three hunderd foot above the airport, was able to see 3 color windows in the object. As I went to stop and position my car to get a better look at the object, it took off to the south-east rotation as it, seems as I stopped, It new someone was watching it! The sky behind this object was somewhat fogged, this may it hard to determined the distance away the object was, just guessing about 300 - 450 yards away! Windows were down in my car and no sound or any thing was heard as the object left the air port and the area!;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
Jetblack/Triangle/cone shaped/I could hear it before I saw it/No markings 10-20,000 ft altitude.;2015-05-18 14:00:00;45 seconds;Jetblack/Triangle/cone shaped/I could hear it before I saw it/No markings10-20,000 ft Altitude I went out back on the deck to get some fresh air after an argument with my wife and saw a black plane, I could hear it that's what caused me to look up, I have 20/20 vision very high def I saw what appeared to be a spy or recon plane at around 10-20,000 Ft.  Watched it for about 45 seconds then it disappeared into the clouds.  No markings just jet black, with no tail and was wing shaped I actually thought it was a hawk at first but definitely was an object.  I would have grabbed another witness but I was in temporary shock I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  I wasn't going to tell anyone since this sighting I was the only witness but I ended up telling and reporting it anyway.   My wife is Airforce it could be a security issue so I am reporting the incident.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
