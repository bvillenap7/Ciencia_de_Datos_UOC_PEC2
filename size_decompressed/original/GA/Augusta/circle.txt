Tonight while heading West/Northwest on I-20 towards Atlanta I saw a circular object  with 9 lights (that light up in a domino effect) light up within 1 second.  It disappeared and reappeared about 2 seconds later in a differnt point in the sky (headed Northwest) in the same sequence. It disappeared and I pulled over on the side of the road and asked the people that were following me if they had seen it.   Of the 5 people that were following me 2 others claimed that they saw it, and described it (in detail) exactly as I had seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, a professional driver, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent and objective in his description of the sighting.  We have the impression that he is an exceptionally good observer, and a very reliable witness.  He is a former member of the U. S. military.  PD));33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998

Flying circular craft in Augusta Georgia.;2014-06-20 16:45:00;2 minutes;Flying circular craft in Augusta Georgia At approximately 4:45 pm, while driving down Interstate 520 going south right past the 520/20 split, I saw coming east towards the south west a grey circular object.  It made no sound.  It was possible within 100 feet above my car.  I did not see any lights or markings on the craft.  At first I thought it was an airplane.   After it moved in front of my vehicle, I saw it was not a plane.  Just as I went to take a photo of it with my phone, it shot straight up into the sky at a tremendous speed.  I did not see it any longer.;33.4580600000001;-82.0363509999998
