Fixed light in daytime sky.;2020-02-22 13:00:00;30 minutes;Fixed light in daytime sky Saw a fixed light in broad daylight that looked like a star above Dobbins Airforce Base in Marietta.  However, it looked like it was reflecting light in the sunlight.  It did not move. It was extremely bright and reflective, very high in the sky.  Upon watching the video it looks like a bright star with other crafts going in and out of it.  There are dots that circle it, go in it, and things moving around it.  It seems too bright to be a daytime star.  After watching it for 30 minutes, I went inside, and when I came back out I could not find it again.  Possibly lights were circling it, or it was the camera picking up the reflection of the object.  I have a video of this event and can provide it.;33.8764560032233;-84.5042042707473
