My friend and I were walking towards a carnival in the parking lot of Belmont Hills Shopping Center (located on the corner of Windy Hill Road (then Cherokee Street)and Atlanta Road in Smyrna, Georgia in the late Spring of 1974. I glanced up into the sky above the shopping center (the sky was dark, probably around 8 p.m.) and observed a disc-shaped object with a row of sequentially blinking circular lights traversing a large angle of the sky repeatedly. This back and forth path covered an angle of maybe 80 degrees or so and was at a low altitude maybe 150 ft or so above the shopping center. Since the sky was dark the lack of reference points made a size estimation difficult, but it appeared maybe 6-8 feet in diameter. The object was totally silent and rapid in its motion. It was witnessed by a couple walking away from the carnival. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.8764560032233;-84.5042042707473
Very bright orange/red lights on disc shaped craft heading due south over Atlanta on New Years Eve;2014-12-31 23:30:00;15 minutes;Very bright orange/red lights on disc shaped craft heading due south over Atlanta on New Years Eve Spotted an unusually bright orange/red light flying north to south over the house on New Years Eve - much like a fireball but without a tail.  Flew directly over Dobbins Air Reserve base towards my residence, (which is perpendicular to their runway).  Solid flare - no colored side lamps, no blinking lights, much brighter than other planes nearby, easily a -6 brightness.  Absolutely silent, left no contrail.  Moved faster than a plane but slower than a meteor.   Was clearly disc shaped as it passed overhead/perhaps more like a donut (darkened center underneath).  As soon as it passed another appeared on same trajectory, then another and another evenly spaced - counted 8 of them in 15 minutes, with one slightly off to our west but still heading due south.   This is highly unusual for regular air traffic because the standard holding pattern from Hartsfield-Jackson airport in Atlanta is to cycle planes to our west heading due north instead.   Could not be lanterns - wind was blowing NNW and these were much larger than anything else in the sky.  Five witnesses.;33.8764560032233;-84.5042042707473

I approximately recorded 2 minutes of the scene.  So the one on the left appear to morph and started to blink one single time the two object where blinking from a bright neon dark orange to just a bright white light as the object on the left dispear it was only blinking the other object know the right was by it's self I keep on recording until it did the same thing as the other I observed not recording and it appear one was comming toward me in a curved I stood still for q sec and then I ran home I wasn't scare nor afraid but I began to have a headed afterwards no sound was made ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
