Fireball over Smynra Georgia USA 4/1/2008 21:30 falling straight to the ground over Dobbins AFB;2008-04-01 21:30:00;15 seconds;Fireball over Smynra Georgia USA 4/1/2008 21:30 falling straight to the ground over Dobbins AFB I live in the City of Smyrna, GA, USA and about 9:30 EST this evening I was sitting on my deck looking due North and saw something falling from North to East towards Marietta and it appeared to be falling over Dobbins.  It looked like a fiery ball, not a meteorite or shooting star.  I've seen meteorites and shooting stars and supposed UFO's, this is nothing like that.  It appeared to be within the atmosphere, but there was no sound.  Has anyone reported this and did it appear on radar?  Thanking you in advance.
