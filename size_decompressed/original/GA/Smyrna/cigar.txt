Very shiny cigar shaped object north of Smyrna, GA around 2:50 pm.;2009-06-29 14:50:00;1 minute;Very shiny cigar shaped object north of Smyrna, GA around 2:50 pm. As I was headed east on South Cobb Drive, approximately 2:50 pm, I came to a red light at the intersection of South Cobb Drive and Spring/Concord Road.  I was probably the fifth or sixth car in line. The light had just turned red so when I came to a stop, I just started gazing at the surroundings.  I noticed what I thought to be a plane north of where I was heading.  At first, I was intrigued at how shiny this plane was.  It was so chrome that it was reflecting.  As I sat there staring at it, I noticed that there was no rear stabilizer.  Just a chrome cigar, sitting there.  I turned to see if traffic had started to move and it hadn't, so I turned back to the object and it was gone.  Just like that!  I looked all around to see if I could spot it but there was no sight of it what so ever anywhere.  I kept searching, hoping to find but the person behind me started blowing their horn because traffic started moving again.  That's when I thought to myself if I was seeing a UFO, so I came home and found this website to see if anybody may have posted something so I wouldn't think I was nuts.  Sure enough, there is a posting on the second of June of a sighting in Canton, GA around the same time, although that is described as oval.  this may have been, I don't know.  What I do know is that is was long, very shiny and if I had to scale it, I would say that it was roughly about an inch and a quarter, maybe and inch and a half in length from where I was sitting.  Amazing.  I will try to retrace my steps around the same time tomorrow and see what happens.;33.8764560032233;-84.5042042707473
