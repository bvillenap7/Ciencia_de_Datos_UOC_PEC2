While driving east on Cumberland Blvd a black or very dark object, rectangular object appeared in my front about 30 deg up and 15-20 deg. right (south) of the sun.  It was not moving horizontally or vertically but definitely was rotating very slowly.  First impression was that it was a strange kite,  Next thought, maybe an airborn, floating piece of plastic or paper but there was definitely no wind.   I slowed to a crawl,  got a good look and it had very sharp corners and was in sharp contrast against the sky...definitely a rectangle.  There was definitely no wobbling or any movement that would indicate that it was teathered or suspended.  It was slowly rotating and changing shape or showing a more angular shape.  My last impression was that it was rectangular but with an arrow shaped point on each end of the rectangle. Really cool as grits !;33.8764560032233;-84.5042042707473
