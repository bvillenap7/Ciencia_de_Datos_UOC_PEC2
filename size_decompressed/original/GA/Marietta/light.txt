No sound, no additional lights as angle changed. I never thought I would contact you twice in one week(I called about a 2nd-hand report of a blue light over Atlanta earlier in the week.) I am not what you would call a trained observer, but I am familiar with the basic characteristics of known conventional aircraft and flight, and I can tell when something is out-of-the-ordinary. I am a very poor judge of height/distances/size, etc., but I am good with spatial relationships and observe things from that perspective. I have the benefit of a college education and have a critical and questioning mind. If this was indeed a sighting of a non-human or non-manmade craft, then it was VERY SUBTLE. It was about 5:45 A.M., and I had just returned home from work (I work at night), and was out walking my dog, who often stops and sits down in the driveway if she feels we have not spent enough time outside, so I was standing there with her and star gazing. I turned and faced North looking at a group of stars in the Northern sky (I do not know which constellation) when I noticed one of them (what I first thought was a star) was moving. This star-like light was EXTREMELY high up, to the extent that it looked about the same size and brightness as the stars behind it. It was moving in a straight path at a fairly slow speed, much like what you would expect to see from a regular airplane(in other words, no abrupt movements or turns, etc.) At first, I began thinking about what it could be, perhaps an airliner VERY high up, a satellite (seemed too fast for that), or some other type of spacecraft (I am uninformed about what is up there in orbit right now). As I stared at it, however, it slightly veered off its straight course and began moving more in line with my line of sight/where I was standing, and was getting brighter. After a minute or so, I could tell that it was getting brighter because it was descending. It was a very cold and perfectly clear night, so I had a ski-cap and coat hood over my head, so I began taking everything off to listen for a sound, and there was none. As the light began approaching the point of being overhead, and since it had veered off course slightly, I figured that as it passed, I would be able to see additional or blinking lights if it was a standard airplane, and at the very least I would hear a sound as it passed overhead, neither of which happened. The light, though brighter, maintained its basic appearance of a white, star-like light. As it got closer it seemed to level-off, but was still very high, and I got the feeling that it was coming down to look at or look for something (monitoring/patrolling?). At this point, I thought it might be a morning traffic or news chopper, but that was highly inconsistent with its original altitude when I first saw it. After about 30 seconds of flying at this height/speed, it seemed to increase its speed to what was approximately double its original speed, veered back left to its original path, and began to ascend rapidly. This is where I began to feel funny about this object, as its ascension seemed to cover an extreme vertical distance in a relatively short amount of time, which seemed like highly unlikely behavior from any type of conventional aircraft. Again, this with NO SOUND and NO ADDITIONAL LIGHTS-by this time it had already passed overhead, and there should have been some defining features if it had been a conventional airplane. As the light continued to traverse the sky, it was obviously climbing faster than it was moving horizontally, because it got so high that I could not see it anymore looking straight on. I offset my eyes slightly and continued tracking the light in my periphery, but after a about 60 seconds of this, it was completely out of view (UPWARDS, NOT ON THE HORIZON). In other words, it went so high up that it was no longer visible, and never fully traversed the entire skyscape from horizon-to-horizon. At this point, I had a very odd feeling about what I had just seen. Although it was not very dramatic, just the basic behavior of this object did not, in my mind, conform to any behavior, attitude, or flight plan that would be expected from any type of aircraft in near-space or in orbit. It seemed that the ascension (and as I later concluded, the first descension) was just too extreme for a conventional aircraft. Adding to that the missing sounds/additional lights that accompany traditional craft, it added up to be a very unusual sighting. Plus, I just felt strange after seeing it.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
2 luminous objects seen traversing sky(space?) @high speed, VERY high altitude;2003-10-17 06:40:00;Approx. 10 seconds;2 luminous objects seen traversing sky(space?) @high speed, VERY high altitude NOTE: to aid in the description of this sighting, I have prepared a graphic/star chart for the time of the sighting, depicting the positions of the celestial bodies, as well as the general positions/trajectories of the objects being described. If there is a place to upload the graphic on this form, the graphic will accompany the report. Otherwise, please email me at the address provided if you wish to view it and I will email it back to you.  I would like to start this report by welcoming Mr. Davenport back to the Coast  program. It has been great hearing him again, and his updates have been missed.  I will also preface this report with this general statement: this is not a very dramatic account. It is, I believe, a sighting of non-natural objects in (or outside)our atmosphere, but is only qualified as such by the confluence of observational details, the character of which seems to add up to something unusual or non-natural. I have had one other sighting in the past, which I reported to NUFORC, which shared many of the same characteristics with this one. While relatively uneventful in a comparative sense, I personally feel that this was a sighting of non-natural objects traveling through our atmosphere (or perhaps, outer space) at fantastic speeds. At this stage of the game, however, such a sighting might be viewed as mundane, and it is anyone's guess as to whether these objects are ours or theirs. I'll leave that judgment to you.  Here goes:  I was standing outside in my driveway at approximately 6:40 A.M., facing East. It was still dark, and the pre-dawn sky was crystal clear. Looking up, I could see the half-Moon directly overhead, with Orion positioned W/SW of the Moon, just over my right shoulder. Looking Eastward several degrees past the Moon, I was just stargazing, staring in the area of Procyon and Pollux, when I noticed an object moving in a linear trajectory from N/NW to SE. I briefly focused on one of the nearby stationary stars so that I could be sure that this was indeed a moving object. It had the appearance (size/luminosity) of a dim point of light, not unlike one of the smaller/dimmer stars that I could see that morning. In fact, it looked like just that&#8230a moving star. The quality of luminosity was consistent and regular, with no flashing, twinkling, flaming, sparking, etc. the object appeared to be very, very high up in the atmosphere at first, but as I watched its traverse across the sky and focused more on its position relative to other bodies in the sky, I became certain that this object was at the very least in near-Earth orbit, if not farther away. As the object moved through and past the Pollux/Castor region of the sky and began to pass the Moon, I began to lose it from direct vision. I attempted to continue tracking the object in my periphery, and was able to hold it for a moment, but lost it in the glare of the Moon (due to the extraordinarily clear sky, the Moon, though only half-lit, was still casting a nice glare). At this point, I was not sure whether the object was beyond the Moon or not. It was not on a trajectory close enough to the Moon to tell whether it would pass in front/behind it. By the time the object reached a position that was past the Moon&#8217s position in the sky, I had lost sight of it completely. This seemed odd to me, because I thought I would be able to pick it up again as it moved past the glare of the illuminated half-Moon. Nevertheless, I lost track of it.  Just as I was about to write the object off as a near-Earth object of some terrestrial construction, I picked up more motion in my left periphery. I was still staring at the place where I had lost track of the 1st object, when I noticed a 2nd object coming in from the N/NW, following an identical trajectory as the 1st object. It had the exact same appearance, size, and luminosity (that of a dim star) as the 1st object, and seemed to be the same distance away, but was moving at roughly twice the speed as the 1st object. It almost appeared to be in pursuit of the 1st object, or moving to catch up to it, at least. This object continued at this pace until it reached the same general position of the 1st object when I had lost sight of it, and I lost track of the 2nd object in the exact same place. As with the 1st object, I focused on the place where I lost sight of it in hopes of picking it back up, but did not.  As I began to turn to my left, I thought I caught a streak of light (much like that of a meteorite) in my periphery, moving from the spot where I lost track of the 2 objects and streaking toward SW, but I cannot be sure of it. I assumed this was probably an optical illusion, as I had no direct view of whatever it was. It is, of course, very possible that the streak came from further movement of one of the two objects, but I do not know. I saw nothing more after this.  To give you an idea of the speed of these objects, I offer the following (please understand that I am not informed in the calculation of relative speeds, but I understand that it can be done, and this type of information helps in doing so): v	As the Moon was directly overhead, it appeared somewhat small, and could be completely obscured by holding a nickel over it in my outstretched hand (I have an arm span of 6&#8217, so approx. 2.5&#8217-3&#8217 in one hand from my eyes). v	The 1st object traversed a path in the sky from about the position of the star Capella to the position of Procyon in about 3.5 seconds. At my arm span (6&#8217), and holding my arms outstretched and pointing my index fingers at each of these positions (like scoring a field goal), the distance between my fingers was about 2-2.5&#8217. v	The 2nd object traversed a path starting well before Capella (when I first noticed it) and ending somewhere around the position of Procyon in about 4.5-5 seconds. Estimating the point where I picked up the 2nd object and pointing one finger there and one to Procyon again, the distance between my fingers was about 4-4.5&#8217. v	So, the 1st object spanned a length of 2-2.5&#8217 in 3.5 seconds, and 2nd object spanned a length of 4-4.5&#8217 in about 4.5-5 seconds.  Again, understand that these are all estimates, as I had to reconstruct positions and times/distances against the star chart after-the-fact, and some of my star references could have been mistaken at the time. Also, I have no good way to estimate the distance of the objects. I am not a mathematician or what you could call a &#8220trained observer&#8221, but I have observed airliners flying high in the atmosphere by day and at night, and I have observed traditional near-Earth objects (satellites, etc.) at night with the naked eye, and I am quite certain that these objects were neither of those things. Though not a great judge of distances and measurements, I am also quite certain that these objects were much higher/further out than those common ones just mentioned.  For the above reasons, it is my opinion that the objects seen had to be non-natural objects that were extremely fast and were extremely high up. Due to the consistency and quality of the light emitted, the linear, airplane-like trajectories, and the speeds at which they apparently were traveling, they almost certainly had to be intelligently piloted craft of some design, capable of distances and speeds not possible with known traditional aircraft.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
Slow moving bright light that faded out seen before dawn.;2004-08-01 06:05:00;10-25 sec;Slow moving bright light that faded out seen before dawn. It was still before dawn and there was a full moon when this sighting occurred. I had gone out on my deck and was enjoying my spa when I notice a light coming from the west going to the east over the tall trees in my back yard. I didn't actually see this object until it was pretty high in the sky due to the trees. It was going slow, like the speed of a single engine prop plane, and was bright like a planet such as Venus. The jets were going in my spa so I don't know if it was making a sound or not. What is strange is that it didn't have any flashing lights like a plane. There is airplane traffic that does come from this direction at about this speed, but as they get closer you can see the nav lights. It looks like it is pretty high up and I am thinking that since it is high up, has no nav lights, and is pretty bright then maybe its a satellite and its being illuminated as it heads toward the sun that is still below the horizon (sunrise is at 6:50). Then it slowly fades at a steady rate until I can no longer see it. It never changed speed or course, was going much too slow to be a meteor, but just dimmed out just before it go directly overhead. There were some high, wispy clouds in the sky, but not enough to obscure this bright of an object and I can see other dim stars in the same area. I looked farther east, over my house, waited for it to reappear in a totally clear area and it never did.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
2 Red lights moving quickly across the sky in unison;2005-08-12 00:30:00;5 minutes;2 Red lights moving quickly across the sky in unison Looking to the east, I noticed a few star-sized red lightsfaintly appearing and then dissappearing. These were behind trees and difficult to see. NOTE: these may or may not be involved in sighting so this part could have just be speculation, thought I did see faint lights behind the trees. All of a sudden I realized two red lights were moving vertically parallel quite quickly at a steady rate across the sky together until they stopped. They couldn't have been an airplane because the lights where exactly parallel the whole time and a little too fast.  They stopped and looked like they were coming forward. There was a little bit of discernable shape around both lights, so I'm unsure if this was an illusion or if it was two objects seperate or one together.

Three orange lights in sky on New Year's Eve in Marietta, GA;2012-01-01 00:03:00;10 minutes;Three orange lights in sky on New Year's Eve in Marietta, GA Shortly after midnight, we observed three bright orange lights in the sky.  At first, it appeared as if they were helicopters, but there was no sound, they didn't have red or green navigational lights, and the lights were bright orange, not white. Given the date and time, one may easily dismiss these lights as part of a fireworks display, etc.  However, the lights were clearly not fireworks, as there was no fireworks display in the area, the lights moved completely across the sky in perfect formation - one right after the other.  They also didn't dissipate or lose altitude, as is common with fireworks, flares, chaff, or skydivers with lights. The second witness with me thought that the lights were only about one hundred feet in the air, or slightly above the tree top level.  I, however, believe they were at least 1000 feet high. These were three separate lights moving slowly from west to east, and then north and out of sight.  This was a very strange way to bring in the New Year.

Light appears in sky the suddenly flashes brightly before streaking in different direction in night sky;2017-06-08 22:00:00;5-8 seconds;Light appears in sky the suddenly flashes brightly before streaking in different direction in night sky I was taking the trash out, and on my way inside, I was looking at the moon and the stars.  There were some clouds but not many.   I then saw what I thought was a dim satellite flying across the sky, and within seconds, it went black, when suddenly a very bright flash appeared, and the object flew off at an incredible rate of speed in a different direction.  I have never seen anything like this and I'm hoping by posting this someone else will come forward who saw it also.  I could not tell what shape it was because I could only see what appeared to be one light.  It was not flashing which is why I thought it was a satellite.  No satellite has ever moved like that though. I immediately ran inside with goosebumps on my arms and told my wife, and then called my brother to tell him what had just happened.

Erratic and fast moving green and yellow bright lights in West Cobb County Marietta, GA,  Early AM Jan 20 and Jan 21.;2018-01-20 01:44:00;>2 hours;Erratic and fast moving green and yellow bright lights in West Cobb County, Marietta, GA, Early AM Jan 20 and Jan 21. 20Jan2018 and 21Jan2018 Marietta, GA.  I am in West Cobb, several miles from Kennesaw Mountain, and yesterday morning, around 1:44 AM EST, I looked out my bathroom window and saw two erratically moving bright objects high in the sky.  One object was to my right, emitting green light, lower in the sky than the other and moving more slowly. The other was a bright pale yellow, much higher to the left and moving rapidly and erratically in a wide path. I cannot tell the shape as I am mainly seeing bright light but the light appears to be circular or oval. I am in a flight path for both McCollum Field and Dobbins Air Reserve Base so initially I thought it might be a helicopter or small plane, but the way the object was moving I do not believe would be possible for a known aircraft. I did see the green object sparkling brightly but barely moving again to the right around 8:26 PM last evening (20Jan2018) and hoped it was just a star in the very cold and clear sky. This morning, around 1:26 AM I again saw the yellowish object to the left.  It was moving up, down and across in the same rapid and erratic pattern as the morning before.  This time however, that object was suddenly joined by a bright green object.  I did not see the green object arrive but it was not there when I first saw the yellow light.  The objects seem to be circling each other but not in any organized fashion.  They are darting back and forth. There appear to be small red lights around the edges of the green object.  I don’t know if the green object is the same one I saw to the right the morning and evening before. I checked McCollum Field’s flight schedule, and there are no scheduled flights or arrivals at this time.  There was only one flight, an arrival at 12:05 AM from Scottsdale that might possibly be heading over my area.  I don’t know how to contact Dobbins to ask whether they have any planes in the air.  Do I need to report this to the police or to Dobbins?  As for my background I am a 56 year old female, currently unemployed but have been a Pharmaceutical/Bio-Tech Project Manager for the past 15 years.  I usually try to find a logical explanation for everything but I also strongly believe there can be no common explanation for some events.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
Several strange lights along with strange sound and electronic disturbance.;2018-08-14 21:20:00;20 minutes;Several strange lights along with strange sound and electronic disturbance. I went in my back yard around 9:15 pm to check and see if the Amber light that has been in the Southwestern sky for the last several nights.  When I went to look it was there along a ball of light in my front yard (southeast), one directly south above a tree and there was a light directly above me,  In addition to those orbs, crafts, lights, or whatever you want to call them, I witnessed an orange/Amber ball of light float above the tree that already had an occupant and then it disappeared (this was the south side of my yard). After that, I started feeling a little nervous and began to go back inside and as I was about to walk in I took another glance at the object in the South East and a light floated down and past the object in the sky. and floated along to the Northeastern corner of my yard behind the trees.   I took several photos and videos of the event with my cell phone so the quality is not that good. I forgot to add that there was a weird horn sound on one of the videos that I took and last night while taking it I didn't notice a sound but it was recorded.  My phone was also malfunctioning a bit saying that there was a strange magnetic field.  A little while after I went inside I heard helicopters. I would really like to know what is going on. I live about 8 miles from Lockheed Dobbins.  I assume there is a lot going on.  What I don't understand is how no one else seems to notice or see them except for a select few people.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
