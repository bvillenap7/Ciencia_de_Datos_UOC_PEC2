Green ball off light;1999-05-11 04:35:00;2-3 seconds;Green ball off light On Tuesday, May 11, at approximately 0435 AM, in Marietta, GA (several miles northwest of Atlanta, GA)  while out jogging, I saw a green (similar to the color of a pre-color  computer screen) ball of light.  I was  proceeding approximately due  south  from Terrill Mill Rd. into the North x  Northwest Office Park when I saw what I believed at first to be a meteor.  The object was moving from  northwest  to southeast (approximate bearing 150  degrees), had no tail (unlike a meteor),  had a clearly defined edge, was  visible for about 1 to 2 seconds and  then disappeared  from a relatively clear sky (particularly clear in  the direction of the object (light ball).  The phrase  winked out describes the way it disappeared.  There was no  noise  as it passed by and no apparent explosion when it went out.  The diameter of the ball  was approximately 1/5 to 1/10 the size of a full moon with a circular shape.  The elevation and speed of a light that  are nearly impossible to estimate at night  against a dark sky. I frequently tape the Art Bell show and Friday (May 14, 1999) listened to a segment  taped earlier that  morning which  included a    description by a woman on the Leaky Leaky Highway in Hawaii.  Aside from the size and proximity her description  was close to what I saw.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
flashing blue-green lights in marietta,ga;2006-12-01 06:15:00;3 minutes;flashing blue-green lights in marietta,ga Around 6:15 am Myself and a friend saw a blue-green cricular light with orbs around it flash outside of a window for about 10 seconds. It appeared as if it was right on the other side of the window. It didn't move- just a ppeared, flashed, and disappeared. My boyfriend was not directly in front of the window but heard a humming and felt a vibration. When we walked outside by the window nothing was there. It was very windy and had been raining. We went out the front door and my boyfriend saw the sky light up wit a blue-green light, but didn't see a specific object. The next door neighbor felt a strong vibration in her bedroom and saw a flashing light.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128

U.F.O. over or very near Dobbings Airforce Base in Marietta, GA. with multi color changing lights.;2008-05-05 04:00:00;5 minutes;U.F.O. over or very near Dobbings Airforce Base in Marietta, GA. with multi color changing lights. n early Sunday morning, May 5th, around 4:00 AM, I witnessed a u.f.o this object was absolutely not a commercial or private airplane. The movement of this vehicle and the color scheme of it's lights ruled out any possibility of man made classification unless top secret.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I was star gazing for a couple of hours prior to this experience. A friend of mine was   also looking at stars and planets both of us were using telescopes. Around 4:00 or so, a bright round object north west of my location caught my attention. The area and placement of this immediately struck me as very unusual. I grabbed my binoculars and focused in on it. The craft seemed to be changing colors in sort of a loop fashion repeating. At first, this color dancing thing led me to believe I was looking at a certain object that I've seen many times prior with similar color change pattern. After just a few seconds I realized this object was not anything I'd seen based on the intense colors being emitted in a pattern or loop and also how it was moving. I feel the object was more round than anything else the color behavior held my attention greatly. Please let me know if anyone else reported a sighting on this date or any other over this area I will email a picture of my viewpoint and where the u.f.o. was exactly. P.S. I'm a 31 year old male native to Atlanta,Georgia. I have a degree in network administration. I Iive on the 18 floor(top) of a building in Buckhead. The view is spectacular. I can see the downtown Atlanta area plus,4 other counties. I've spent many nights star gazing on this roof and I've never seen anything even remotely close to this.

Several reddish/orange lights in formation seen by two witnesses north of Atlanta, GA (Marietta, GA) on Dec. 24, 2016.;2016-12-24 19:55:00;1 minute;Several reddish/orange lights in formation seen by two witnesses north of Atlanta, GA (Marietta, GA) on Dec. 24, 2016. On the way to a store on Dec. 24, 2016 (7:55 pm), several red/orange lights were observed in the sky by two witnesses as they traveled by car.  They appeared a little larger than the stars in the background.  They had a circular shape and did not blink.  There seemed to be two batches of lights.  Each contained five to six lights per group.  The second group formed a square with one light in the middle.  They moved slowly (if at all), then disappeared suddenly.  It was as if they sank behind the tree line.   Note:  There was an airplane off to the left that could be seen at the same time.  The airplane displayed the normal characteristics of white light with blinking lights and was moving at typical airplane speed.  The red UFO circles clearly appeared much different then the normal aircraft flying off to the left.  The red UFOs where bigger in size as well.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128

It was a dark color and no sound I was in my backyard and I saw some planes passing by.  As one passed by a dark circular shaped object was floating stationary off in the distance . I stared at it for many seconds and tried to capture it on my phone and my video wasn’t working at that moment.  For some strange reason.  It remained stationary then I got up to get a closer look.  And it began slowly moving to the left and then poof disappeared!;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
