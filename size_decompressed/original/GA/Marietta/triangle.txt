Triangle shaped craft hovered over trees and then disappeared into nothing;2001-04-30 15:47:00;10 seconds;Triangle shaped craft hovered over trees and then disappeared into nothing As said, there were two witnesses to this 'craft'. I have never reported anything of such before, mainly because I do my own research, but this needed to be heard. Two of us were in a car driving up a road from where I live, and we saw what first appeared to be a helicopter flying very low, the person with me even remarked that it was in fact one, but it was only a few feet above the trees, no more and no less. The altitude of this craft was amazingly low, and when I finally caught it with my own eyes, it had a triangular shape to it I could not find any evidence of blades on the craft. Now, of the one thing I am certain...it was not any type of helicopter mainly for two reasons. First, it made no sound, and second there would be some type of physical activity in that general area of the craft for it being that low in altitude. (Mainly, the wind velocity causing branches to sway, etc...) After seeing the craft, it seemed to have had a 'sense' of something and it finally darted back behind the trees (Tall pines). It did not take us more than 3 seconds to drive to where we could see behind the trees and into full sky view where any normal object would clearly be in view. It was gone...there was nothing. From going back to the 'site' I have not found anything, all I know is that I consider this one of the greatest sightings I have seen myself in quite a while. Certainly, I have not witnessed one that close. Broad daylight made it that much more spectacular. There was not a cloud in the sky, and you could see the metallic sheen of the craft. It truly was fascinating...And my eyes will be open to maybe capturing the image of it soon, if in fact it does show again.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
I saw two pink triangles at about 4:30pm in Marietta, GA, on April 24, 2004, which moved in unison then disappeared into the clouds.;2004-04-24 16:30:00;30 mins.;I saw two pink triangles at about 4:30pm in Marietta, GA, on April 24, 2004, which moved in unison then disappeared into the clouds. April 24, 2004, in Marietta, Georgia, was a beautiful, sunny, spring day.   At about 4:30pm, I was lying on my bed, just looking up through my bedroom window (which has no blinds or shades), at the clear blue sky and a few puffy white clouds.  All of a sudden, I noticed TWO PINK TRIANGLES way up in the clouds.  I could not judge the distance, but it was very high...high enough for airplanes to fly, as I have seen many times before...but I knew these were not airplanes!   Continuing to watch the TWO PINK TRIANGLES as they moved in close proximity to each other...I was trying to figure out what they were.  I knew that they were not balloons...as they did not move with the wind...nor were they kites...which could easily be blown about as well.  These either stayed stationary, or they moved in unison to the left, then right, and then up.  Finally, they disappeared into the clouds. Immediately phoning my cousin in Darlington, PA to report what I had just witnessed, a short time later while still on the phone, I was astonished to see the TWO PINK TRIANGLES reappear in the sky.  I observed them again, for about 5 or 10 minutes, and then they disappeared into the clouds, never to be seen again. Having seen many programs on TV about UFO's, I knew that what I observed were very unusual.  Never before had I heard of a UFO described as a PINK TRIANGLE.  But I knew what I had seen was NOT an airplane, balloon, kite, or anything else I have ever seen before.  I felt in my gut that what I had seen was very definitely a UFO!   I am a Doctor of Chiropractic and I live and practice in Marietta, GA.  I have no history of hallucinations, nor of seeing UFO's.  My professional education has taught me to make objective observations of scientific evidence, and not to jump to conclusions until all the facts are in.  However, I am quite convinced that what I observed on April 24, 2004 were, in fact, TWO PINK TRIANGLES THAT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN UFO's.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128

Black triangle hovering in one spot with one red light on a corner and white lights on the others.;2010-07-08 22:30:00;Five Minutes;Black triangle hovering in one spot with one red light on a corner and white lights on the others. Thursday, July 8th, 2010.   I would have reported this earlier, but I wanted to do a little research first.  I was driving home from a gathering with friends in Marietta, Georgia.  The time was approximately 10:30 PM and I was traveling west on Whitlock just before Kennesaw Mountain Battlefield Park, when I noticed a large, black rectangular object hovering just above the tree line.  It had one red light on the corner and two white lights on the other corners.  I had the window down and I didn’t hear any noise.  As I reached the park, I could see that it was actually hovering at the tree line on the edge of the park.  What had initially caught my attention was that it was not moving at all.  I turned around after I passed the park to get another look, but the object was gone.  We are near Lockheed, so I thought perhaps it was an experimental craft of some sort, if they perhaps have some kind of silent craft capable of hovering in one spot.  I thought I’d go ahead and report it since it didn’t fit anything I’d ever seen.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
Triangle in Marietta near Barret and Dallas highway.;2010-08-31 21:30:00;5 Minutes;Triangle in Marietta near Barret and Dallas highway. Driving east on dallas highway past Barret Parkway not too far from Kennessaw Mountain.  Triangle (3 lights on formation at approximatly 45 degree angle from each other) hovering above the tree line near Avonwood drive, there is a subdivision near by.    We saw driving it east and thought maybe it was a cell tower but the lights were too far from each other.  We turned around to go west and find a near by street to get a closer look and it had disapeared in the few minutes it took to turn around.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
Slow-moving triangle aircraft visible in night sky.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-27 22:20:00;3 minutes;Slow-moving triangle aircraft visible in night sky. Sphere ball of light in the night sky that caught my attention while I was driving.  I thought it was a cell tower light but knew there wasn’t one near by.  The ball of light continued to move and then I lost a visual on it.   I come to a red light, looked for the ball of light, but then see a slow triangle aircraft flying close to the ground and moving slowly.  It had red,blue, and green lights and was only in my line of sight for about 10 seconds.  It seemed odd that an aircraft like that would be flying so close to the ground when the local airport is several miles away.   I was not able to video record any of these since I was driving, but it did spook me enough to look online to see if anyone else had witnessed it.

A triangular shaped aircraft with a light on each corner that made no sound and was extremely low flying.;2019-09-26 22:30:00;1;A triangular shaped aircraft with a light on each corner that made no sound and was extremely low flying. Driving north on I 75 passing through Marietta at night. One other vehicle nearby (a trucker) when a silent, triangle shaped aircraft passed overhead, very low near the interstate.  It appeared to be preparing to land but there was no airport nearby and it was moving much too fast.  There was a light on each of the corners of the craft.  It disappeared as quickly as it appeared, never making a sound and leaving no trail behind it.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
