I saw a silver cigar in a clear blue sky over Marietta, GA.;2004-03-10 14:20:00;3 minutes;I saw a silver cigar in a clear blue sky over Marietta, GA. My husband and I were driving north on Johnson Ferry Road at about 2:20 in the afternoon. I was on the passenger side and looked east out the window into the clear blue spring sky. Due east, at about 45 degrees, I saw what looked like a silver airplane with no wings (just a silver tube). The sky around it shimmered in kind of a circular pattern. It didn't seem to be moving at all, and there was no sound. After watching a couple of minutes, I wondered why I couldn't see the wings. I'm slightly nearsighted (20/40) so I put on my glasses to see it better. It looked the same - still no wings. I watched about another 30 seconds or so then it disappeared as I watched. It didn't get smaller like it was going away, nor did it go behind a cloud. It just kind of clicked off. I told my husband that I think I just saw a UFO. We got home about 5 minutes later. After a couple of minutes, I heard military jets overhead. I don't know if the two events were connected. (Don't know if they scrambled to chase or if the jets were coincidentally there a couple minutes later.);33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
Three silent white cigar shaped objects floated across the sky at 10:30 to 11:30 Sunday morning.;2016-10-09 10:30:00;1 hour;Three silent white cigar shaped objects floated across the sky at 10:30 to 11:30 Sunday morning. My granddaughter and I witnessed an object that was travelling from southwest to northeast that was white and appeared the size and shape of a jumbo jet minus and wings.  It made its way silently across the sky until it reached the horizon.  The really strange part of this story is... this sighting repeated three times over a period of one hour. I'm assuming it was three different craft because it moved so slowly across the sky. We are not far from Dobbins Air Force Base and no fighter jets were scrambled (several years ago I witness an orange ball of light moving across the sky that was chased by a fighter jet) but nothing as dramatic as that occurred.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
