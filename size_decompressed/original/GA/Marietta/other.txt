Big Object In the sky in Georgia (North-West of Atlanta) In Late July 2008;2008-07-23 22:55:00;4-5 minutes;Big Object In the sky in Georgia (North-West of Atlanta) In Late July 2008 While traveling to work on Cobb Parkway north bound at the I-285 junction overpass just outside of Atlanta, Georgia in the Marietta city limits I saw in the direction north of Kennasaw Mountain a large object in the sky shape like a large unfamiliar type ship. The front was triangle or pointed in shape with the rear blocked or square in sharp and the center was rectangle with a ark like shape. It was tilted in a 35-45 degree angle with no movement. The color was a metallic dark gray. The object remained stationary in the air for several minutes. It had no vapor trail. It just remained in the air suspended. I know I was not the only person who saw it due to it not being dark and there was a fair amount of cars heading in the same direction on Hwy 41 plus it was so obvious. At first you would think it was a blimp and I was hoping it was but it wasn't. I never seen a blimp shape like a block shape battle ship. Whatever it was it was large, heavy, and solid. It was just hanging there like it was docking calm and peaceful. No movement at all. I just watched it as I was alert enough to avoid not hitting another cars at the light. wondering when or if it was going to move. After I stopped and got my lunch for the evening and at local restaurant when I can out it was gone with no vapor trail that hinted in its direction of travel. If the U.S. has something like that in its garage tax payers need to be mad and ask for an goverment audit. We have technology but we don't have that type of technology yet. This thing was amazing.
