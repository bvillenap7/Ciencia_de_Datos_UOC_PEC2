I NOTICED A LARGE OBJECT IN THE SKY IN THE SHAPE OF AN OVAL.;2000-05-01 04:00:00;unknown;I NOTICED A LARGE OBJECT IN THE SKY IN THE SHAPE OF AN OVAL. MY STORY I AM A WOMAN OF FMTH. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE MINISTERED IN CHURCHES FOR THIRTY (30) YEARS. WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU IS TRUE. EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE HIGHLY UNUSUAL TO THOSE WHO PRACTICE FAITH IN GOD AND A CHRISTIAN LIFE STYLE, IT HAPPENED TO ME. I SAW WHATI SAW MY HUSBAND AND I LIVE IN A LOG HOME ON TWO ACRES OF WOODED LAND THAT BORDERS ONE SIDE OF ATWO ACRE LAKE. ON SUNDAY NIGHT APRIL 30,2000, WE ARRIVED HOME FROM CHURCH AND A CHOIR SOCIAL ABOUT 9:30 PM. WE PREPARED FOR BED AND WATCHED SOME NEWS BEFORE RETIRING FOR THE EVENING. OUR USUAL TIME FOR BED IS ABOUT 11:00PM. SLEEP CAME QUCKLY BECAUSE OF THE EXHAUSTIVE DAY AT CHURCH. AT 2:59 AM, MONDAY, MAY 1,1 LOOKED AT THE. CLOCK AS I RETURNED FROM A TRIP TO THE BATHROOM. IMMEDIATELY, I WAS ASLEEP AGAIN. I AM NOT SURE OF THE TIME THAT I AWOKE THE SECOND TIME. BUT, WHAT I SAW OCCURRED WHEN IT WAS STILL DARK. DAYLIGHT BEGINS TO ARRIVE AROUND 6:00AM EDT AT THIS TIME OF YEAR. I ESTIMATE THE TIME HAD TO BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 3 AND 5AM. ABOVE OUR BED IS A SKYLIGHT THAT WE ENJOY ON A CLEAR NIGHT AS WE OBSERVE THE STARS AND MOON OF GOD'S BEAUTIFUL HANDIWORK. ON THIS NIGHT, IT WAS NOT THE STARS AND THE MOON THAT CLAIMED MY ATTENTION. WHEN I AWOKE THIS SECOND TIME, I NOTICED A LARGE OBJECT IN THE SKY ABOVE THE SKYLIGHT. IT WAS MORE OVAL IN APPEARANCE THAN ROUND. IT WAS TURNED UP ON ITS SIDE IN A VERTICAL POSITION WHERE I COULD SEE THE TOP PORTION OF THE. OBJECT FROM A SIDE VIEW. THERE WERE THREE (3) WINDOWS VISIBLE ON THE SIDE OF THE TOP PORTION AS IT WAS TURNED IN THS VERTICAL POSITION. THE WINDOWS WERE TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE AND FILLED WITH LIGHT. WHEN I OBSERVED THE OBJECT, IT WAS MOVING TOWARD THE EARTH. AS I WATCHED TFIROUGH THE SKYLIGHT, THE OBJECT MOVED DIRECTLY TOWARD THE SKYLIGHT. IT MOVED AT A STEADY RATE OF SPEED MAKING A SOFT SWISHING SOUND. THE SWISHING SOUND SEEMED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOCKWISE MOTION OF THE EXTERNAL PART OF THE OBJECT. WHEN THE OBJECT WAS NEAR THE SKYLIGHT, THE CLOCKWISE MOTION STOPPED AND THE OBJCT STOOD STILL, BUT CONTINUED TO MAKE THE SOFT SWISHING SOUND. AS IT MOVED AWAY FROM THE SKYLIGHT, THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MOTION OF ANY PART OF THE OBJECT, THE SOFT SOUND CONTINUED. AS THE OBJECT MOVED ACROSS THE SPACE OF THE SKYLIGHT, I OBSERVED THE BOTTOM OF THE OBJECT. THERE WERE A SERIES OF LIGHTS EMBEDDED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE OBJECT. THESE LIGHTS WERE WHITE AND RED. THE FINISH ON THIS SIDE OF THE OBJECT WAS A GREY METALLIC FINISH. THE OBJECT WAS SO CLOSE AND THE LIGHT WAS SO BRIGHT THAT I COULD SEE THE DETAIL OF THE SURFACE. THE NIGHT WAS AS BRIGHT AS DAY AS THE OBJECT STOOD STILL OVER THE HOUSE. THE OBJECT STOPPED MOTION BRIEFLY AND THEN PROCEEDED MOVING PAST THE SKYLIGHT. AS IT MOVED, IT CONTINIJED TO MAKE THE SWISHING SOUND AND THE DARKNESS REAPPEARED. USUALLY MY FIRST RESPONSE WOULD BE TO AWAKE MY HUSBAND. BUT, I WAS SO CAUGHT UP IN WHAT I WAS SEEING THAT THE OBJECT WAS MOVING AWAY BEFORE I COULD THINK CLEARLY ENOUGH TO TAKE ACTION. SO, I JUST LET IT GO. I WAS SO STRICKEN WITH SUCH AWE, THAT I COULD NOT MOVE. I WOULD HAVE JUMPED UP AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AS IT MOVED AWAY, BUT FEAR LEFT ME MOTIONLESS. MY WHOLE BODY WAS MOTIONLESS.  I DID NOT LOOK AT THE CLOCK WHICH IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL. I ALWAYS CHECK THE CLOCK WHEN I WAKE UP DURING THE NIGHT. BUT, I JUST LAY THERE IN THE DARK STARING INTO THE NIGHT UNABLE TO MOVE A MUSCLE. AS SOON AS MY HUSBAND AWOKE, ABOUT 6AM, I TOLD HIM I HAD SOMETHING TO TELL HIM BEFORE HE WENT TO HIS STUDY TO BEGIN HIS DAY. HE IS SORRY HE MISSED SEEING WHAT I SAW. THIS IS MY STORY. I KNOW I SAW WHAT I SAW. YES, I WAS AWAKE THEN AND A LONG TIME AFTER THE INCIDENT.

I looked up in the sky about halfway between 0and zenith and there was what appeared to be an oval shaped golden beige craft hovering still on the sky about a mile out.  It stayed there for about five minutes.  I knew it was there because the sun reflected light off of it.  Within a two second time frame the craft began to disappear from left to right and then it was gone almost as if it knew it had been spotted.  Very strange.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
Tri-colored phosphorous looking oval gliding effortlessly and silently over-head.;2016-04-24 22:30:00;2 seconds;tri-colored phosphorous looking oval gliding effortlessly and silently over-head. As my custom, I took my dog out the front door into my lawn for one last break before retiring to bed.  Customarily I use this time to look over-head to check the night sky.  Peering into a beautiful, clear, cool night sky, I spotted a glowing oval shaped craft which appeared to be tri-colored and emitting a phosphorescent glow as it glided silently over-head.  The object appeared to be two inches in length if held at an arm's length distance.  If I had to venture a guess I would say the object was approximately 400-600 feet elevation at an angle of 60 degrees.  The duration did not exceed 2 seconds in length, but will last a lifetime in my memory.  I was stunned at the fluidity of it's flight and it's complete lack of sound.  If I had a camera posed and ready to shoot, it would have been a miracle to capture this swift flying object.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
