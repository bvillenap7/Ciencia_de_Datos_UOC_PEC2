Weather clear, sunny, and blue sky's. While working in the yard (north side) I was watching two commercial jets as they were flying over the  Atlanta / Marietta area, at a (high altitude w/ com trails) clearly not local Hartsfield traffic. I noticed a shiny round / spherical object at a higher altitude then the two intersecting commercial jets. The object did not appear to be moving a first but after observing it for a moment or two I realized it was tracking very slowly from north to south/west. After a few minutes I went for the binoculars and was only able to view it for a moment before losing track of it. I could not tell any details other then realized it was larger and still metallic looking.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
Bright orange sphere in the sky.;2012-12-15 00:00:00;1.5 minutes;bright orange sphere in the sky Last night around midnight, I was out smoking on my deck. I saw a bright orange sphere come from the east.  I saw it through the trees as it broke the plane of my tree line.  It was a bright vivid orange color. It slowly changed directions and curved to the left.  It was a gradual change in direction. It followed the top of my tree line as clear as could be. then it slowly changed direction again toward the west and eventually passed below my tree line.   I estimate this object to be about 3-7 miles away, it was hard to tell.  The way it moved was very smooth almost gliding like...no speratic shifts or jerking..  For as far away as it was, it still had a good size to it.  There was no wind outside and it was absolutely silent.  I am 40 years old.  I would consider myself a skeptic to things like this.  I am not saying that it was an alien life form, but I am  saying that is was nothing like I had ever seen and I could not even begin to guess at what it could have been .  I am interested to see if anyone else saw what I saw last night.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
EMERALD GREEN ORB PUTS ON LIGHT SHOW IN MARIETTA GA.;2017-05-07 21:00:00;6 seconds;EMERALD GREEN ORB PUTS ON LIGHT SHOW IN MARIETTA GA. The wife and I were sitting on our deck, looking at the stars and the waxing moon.  It was around 9:00 P.M. on a cool Spring Sunday night.  The sky was clear and cloud free. The moon was @ 95% full.  I was looking over the roof line of my house towards the south and east.  My wife was looking south and west.   Suddenly there was a flash of light over the roof line in my sight of vision.  It was an intense, luminous emerald green color.  It looked like electrical sparks with arcing shards of current.  It appeared to be 3 or 4 times larger than the moon.  From the center of this matrix emerged what appeared to be a round or slightly oval orb with what looked like a lightning bolt trailing it.  The short trajectory of the object curved @ 180 degrees (like the letter C) and it stopped at that point.  The trailing energy field that followed the orb was visually sizzling (no sound) like the fuse of a firecracker and eventually subsided.   The orb was standing completely motionless at that point. If the moon was a basketball this orb would have been a softball.  I yelled at my wife to look at the object and she stood up in time to see it begin to pulse and speed away.  It shot into the tree line and disappeared.  I have never seen anything move so fast from a dead stop.  It seemed to me the pulsing of the object correlated with it's rate of acceleration,.as if the pulsing was a proponent of it's propulsion.  The angle of the sighting was at a 45/50 degree angle.  It appeared to be moving laterally due south.   My personal opinion is that the object made a dimensional shift, like a car running off the road.  The initial light show appeared to be a force field that had been breached.  As the object stood motionless, after its introduction into our world, it appeared to get its bearings and re-enter it original flight plan.  That's just my take, or maybe it was here to stay.  I hope to make a computer model in real time of the experience.  This is something the wife and I will never forget.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
