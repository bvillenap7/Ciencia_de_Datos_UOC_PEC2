Purple and pink colors and a defined round white center moving around the morning sun.;2019-11-03 09:10:00;30 minutes;Purple and pink colors and a defined round white center moving around the morning sun. ON NOV. 3, 2019 AT 9:12 AM, I WAS WALKING MY DOG AND STOPPED TO NOTICE HOW THE VERY BRIGHT SUN WAS SHINING EXACTLY AT AN OPEN SPOT IN A TREE NEAR MY HOME. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE SUN BECAME A LIGHT PURPLE COLR AND ABOUT ONE MINUTE LATER, IT BECAME A PINK COLOR.  I DECIDED TO OVE MY POSITION TO SEE WHAT COULD BE CAUSING THIS ANOMALY. THE SUN WAS BLINDING, SO I DECIDED TO GO HOME QUICKLY AND TAKE A PHOTO SO THAT I WOULD NOT HURT MY EYES BY STARING INTO IT ANY LONGER.  FROM THE PORCH, I TOOK SEVEN PHOTOS AND THE RESULTS CAPTURED THE EVENT CLEARLY. A COLORED OBJECT WITH A BRIGHT BALL-SHAPED CENTER MOVED AROUND THE SUN AND THAT IS WHAT CAUSED THE COLOR OF THE SUN FROM MY VIEW. PHOTOS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.  NOTE: I LIVE CLOSE TO DOBBINS AIR FORCE BASE WHERE MANY SIGHTINGS HAVE OCCURRED.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
My wife and I were in our backyard with our two toddlers, and my wife saw something in the sky at approximately 4:10pm eastern time.  S;2021-02-24 16:10:00;2 minutes;My wife and I were in our backyard with our two toddlers, and my wife saw something in the sky at approximately 4:10pm eastern time.  She told me there was a white light moving across the sky and asked if I could see it. I didn't see it at that time. Then she began to record on her phone, and that's when I focused on the sky and saw the object as well. We saw two white objects moving across the sky very quickly, and only one was caught on video. Our first video she was trying to capture the first object, and she didn't get it on camera, however the second object appears in the lower right corner of the frame. She noticed it and began recording again, and caught the second object moving and then disappearing into the sky. We really thought nothing of it at first, but then around 2 or 3 minutes later a military jet zoomed past in the same direction the objects went. We watched the videos together later on after our babies were in bed, and we realized it was so! mething out of the ordinary. I paused the first video when the object appeared in the lower corner, and I zoomed in and took a screenshot of the object. It appears to be a saucer shaped object, and we believe it to be a ufo.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
