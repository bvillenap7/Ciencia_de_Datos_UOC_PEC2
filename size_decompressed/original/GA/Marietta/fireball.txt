Fireball over Marietta, Ga;2011-12-23 20:18:00;1 minute 30seconds;Fireball over Marietta, Ga The fireball moved very slowly across the sky. I was driving north on Johnsons Ferry Rd at the intersection of Sewell Mill Rd.  At first I thought it was a helicopter, then noticed it looked more like a flame.  I pulled over in a neighborhood to get a better look.  It appeared to be a fireball very high in the sky.  The fireball moved south towards 285.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128
Green Fireball in my neighborhood;2012-03-07 22:00:00;10 seconds;Green Fireball in my neighborhood My brother and I were running outside at night and after our jog we always do some push ups and crunches in the street near my driveway.  After finishing my crunches I laid there on the road and I looked at the sky then looked behind me and to my right and saw a green fiery ball coming down almost looking like it landed in my neighbors yard.  We tried to get close and see if it landed but his whole yard is fenced and I couldn’t see in the back yard.  I first thought it was a shooting star but there’s no way, it was WAY to close.  It almost looked like fireworks but there are no kids in my neighborhood and especially not in the house that it landed behind.  We couldn’t even hear people talking. It was dead silent.  This is the 2nd time I’ve witnessed this green fiery ball but never this close.  The first time was in my girlfriend’s neighborhood in Acworth, GA but it was a lot further in the sky, but again you could tell it was NOT a shooting star, and it was definitely not fireworks because of the length and size of it.  Not to mention it was GREEN and it was FAST.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128

They were obviously not helicopters as they made no sound.  You could clearly make out the rounded shape of the craft on the bottom half.  They were in a straight line formation with the last 4 in a circular pattern.  I pulled over and observed them for about 5 minutes and then drove on.  When I returned to the area 15 minutes later they were gone.;33.9683919449902;-84.5182383104128

((NUFORC Note:  No information provided by witness.  PD));2015-07-10 22:00:00;5 seconds;((NUFORC Note:  No information provided by witness.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) The object looked like a small Sun, but not as bright.  It did not have a trail but it did have a wide tail that looked like it might have moved so  fast that it just appeared to have a wide tail.  It was in the eastern sky, well above the trees.  It moved up and swerved to the left. I saw it for a few seconds before it vanished.  I could tell that it was pretty far away, but it had to have been huge and close to Earth.
