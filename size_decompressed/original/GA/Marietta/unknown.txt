Brilliant white object over Marietta GA  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of a twinkling star.  PD));2011-07-30 02:00:00;3 hours;Brilliant white object over Marietta GA Friday evening in Marietta, GA the sky was extremely clear.  The sky was full of stars.  Noticied object with bright lighting in the sky around 2:00 a.m. Saturday morning.  Object appeared to turn in different angles and also could move fast.  It is hard to say how far in the air the object was located.  This object hovered above in the sky for over three hours.  Lighting very bright white and it almost looked as if at times it had lights coming down.   I also noticed smaller objects a couple of times around the object headed towards the object and those disappeared.  I took several pictures and also recorded videos.   After reviewing the pictures on my cell phone it is clear that the object was changing angles in the sky.  One looks round, one looks almost boomerang shaped.  Object did not land and I was not able to stay awake long enough to see it leave or disappear.  I watched the object until after 5:00 a.m. Saturday morning.

Streaking greenish-bluish light, moving quickly and disappearing.;2012-03-16 21:00:00;10 seconds;Streaking greenish-bluish light, moving quickly and disappearing. Greenish-Bluish light streaked through the sky from East to West somewhat low on the horizon. I thought it was a meteor, but find no reports on the news.  This makes me think that it was a more localized event than I originally thought. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
