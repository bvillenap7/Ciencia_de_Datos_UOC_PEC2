Erratic movement, flashing colors, and multiple lights are hovering over over my North Georgia home.;2016-04-08 23:20:00;1 hour;Erratic movement, flashing colors,  And multiple lights are hovering over over my North Georgia home. Another witness and I were sitting inside our house when I glanced out the window to see what I thought to be a pulsing star.  I watched it for awhile, noticing that it would disappear and reappear.  It also changed colors ranging from blue, violet, white, to bright green.   I told the other witness to come outside to see it clearer, and we saw it rotating counterclockwise then procede rotate clockwise.  It then made very small and erratic movements, jolting from left to right and bouncing up and down.  It was the other witness who pointed out that there was another one to the right of the main one.  It was slightly smaller and  less bright, located almost even with our house but still just as far as the main one.  Two other popped out of seemingly nowhere to the left of the main one and flashed bright green and moved torward each other.  This  continued for 30 more minutes until they all slowly faded away.;34.4592;-84.4789
