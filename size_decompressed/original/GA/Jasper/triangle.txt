It happpened on September 21, 1986 around 6:30 a.m.  I was in the bed fixing to get up to go to school (the 6th grade).  My mom woke me up all upset saying she dreamed of a tornado.  She woke up and looked outside and saw a UFO.  She said it was low on the ground making a beeping noise like it was in trouble and changed colors.  Suddenly it took off.  I laughed at her and said, yeah right.  I got up and looked out the window.  It was back!  I saw it too!  My body was in complete shock and couldn't move.  I saw that it was about 3 feet hovering above the ground, and it looked like a triangular shape.  It was a solid white color for a few seconds.  It didn't make a noise when I saw it.  It was next to our big tree and mail box about 3 feet above ground on our dirt road (back then it was very remote).  Then it changed colors from white to red and took off and dissappeared with a second! ! I got the courage to go outside to try and find evidence.  I couldn't find anything and went back in the house.  I know it had to be something (either something from the government, a real UFO, or who knows).  I still think about it till this day.  It changed the way I think about things now.  I still believe in God, but I do think of things more scientifically as well.  I forgot the camera because I was in total shock!  I truly thought in my mind that they may know if I took their picture.  I certainly didn't want to be killed at 11 years old.
