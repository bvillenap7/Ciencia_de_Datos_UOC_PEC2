White triangular formation in the night sky over Metter, GA;2011-12-08 00:00:00;5 minutes or less;White triangular formation in the night sky over Metter, GA My girlfriend and i was going home last night around midnight traveling on Hwy 121 coming through Metter, GA in route to our home in Statesboro, GA when i noticed 3 white lights in the shape of a triangle in the sky.  I thought it was shooting stars at first but it kept on going for approx 3 mins.   My girlfriend was driving and i pointed it out to her and she saw it as well.   We continued on Hwy 46 going towards Statesboro and I kept looking behind us and up in the sky and the 3 white triangular shaped lights appeared again briefly only to disappear within a minute.  I reported it to the Metter Advertiser to see if anyone else noticed this event.  They said no one has reported anything as of this am.;32.4021;-82.061
