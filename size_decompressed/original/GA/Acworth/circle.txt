Circular object , crimson in color, maybe 10-20 ft. in dia., hovering maybe 20' above ground, appeared to be non-solid/holgram;1995-07-15 05:30:00;20-30 seconds;Circular object , crimson in color, maybe 10-20 ft. in dia., hovering maybe 20' above ground, appeared to be non-solid/holgram I was working part time cleaning carpet. One Friday? night, I was arriving home later than usual, about 5:30 am. Still dark outside. I lived one house from the cul-de-sac. Behind the last house was a large field, with a large house maybe 200 yards up on the hill. I usually make a wide turn (just made it easier to turn into my driveway). As I was going in to my turn, that's when I stopped. What I was seeing was so unexpected, I think I was just mesmerized for a moment. I kept the object in my view for maybe 10 seconds. Here's where I screwed up. I thought I would park the car in the driveway (about 20' from the road) and run out to get a better look. Don't ask my why. You know about hindsight. I did this. The object was gone. There was never any sound. The object  appeared to be circular, maybe 10 - 15' in diameter. But the wierdest thing was that it had a yellow strobe (like on a DOT vehicle) somehow attached to it. But the object did not seem to be solid, more like a holgram or ball of plasma or just a ball of light. No one else saw this to my knowledge, being the time of day. I reported this to MUFON via the web, but did not here back. Not sure when I filed the MUFON report, as the web had just came into being I think in '95, I just had purchased my first PC compatible computer and was just getting hooked up to the web around the same time as the sighting in June of '95. Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.076772368421;-84.6268
Saw a bright light disappear then reappear closer, then slowly fade to dark.;2012-02-22 19:44:00;4 mins;Saw a bright light disappear then reappear closer, then slowly fade to dark. I just stepped outside and was on the phone and looked up thinking it's been awhile since I've stargazed and saw what I thought was a bright star, maybe the north star.  I was staring at it and it went dark.  I live in the woods so I thought maybe a tree branch had got in the way and I walked to another part of my porch, clear of branches.   I stared up but did not see anything, then the light came back on. it was bright again and it appeared to be closer to my house.  I kept staring and it went dimmer but still visible, then went out again.  I should've stayed out longer to see if it would have ca me back on but honestly got freaked out and went back in.  It happened at 7:40  and lasted until 7:44. It's 7:59 now and im going back out to see if anything else pops up.  I'll post again if anything appears.;34.076772368421;-84.6268
Brilliant white orbs moving slowly across sky in north Georgia.;2014-07-14 22:35:00;25 seconds;Brilliant white orbs moving slowly across sky in north Georgia. I was out smoking a cigarette before bed.  I was looking up ar the sky seeing flashes from fire flies and noticed a few stars.   About half way through my smoke, I noticed the star has moved from where I was sitting from directly above a tree to the right.  I continued to watch this star move from east to west.  It was a bright brilliant white circle/orb.  It moved from a complete stationary position to moving slower than a plane a high altitude.  It moved across the sky for about 25 seconds before vanishing into a clear sky.   This is the third time I have seen this.  Im always looking to the sky and use my Mobile Observatory by Wolfgang Zima (Kreapp) and I'm very familiar with astronomical events.   I can say this was NOT a plane, ISS, a meteor or an asteroid.  I've seen one with my girl friend that pulsed like magnesium burning in the sky moving from east to west also but this one slowed down and shot off like a laser at a 90Â° angle and disappeared.  I'm curious to see if anyone else in north Georgia has seen these brilliant white orbs treating the sky like a playground.  I believe hands down without a doubt that physics does not lie and what I have seen are truly something from the outskirts of our solar system, a UFO.;34.076772368421;-84.6268
Was not a plane or fireworks!  We could clearly see the shape of it!;2015-07-04 22:00:00;15 minutes;Was not a plane or fireworks! We could clearly see the shape of it! We noticed a red light flashing in the air moving at the speed of a small plane but no noise, about 1000 feet up.  There were 7 lights following each other in the same path, they were from 1 minute to 3 minutes apart from one another!  We got out some binoculars and it was shape like a black or gray cloud with the light underneath.  No wings or sound!  The last one went by and the light went out on it and it disappeared!;34.076772368421;-84.6268
