I was on my way to my aunt's house when I just happened to look up to the right and immediately I noticed a dark cigar shaped UFO in the sky.   It was kinda far away, but I knew that I was not looking at a plane.   All of a sudden, it was like the UFO began reflecting the Sun, and it glowed a very bright orange.   At this time the object became obscured by trees, and when it became clear again, the object was gone.   I searched the sky for several minutes looking for the ufo, but I was able to find it again.;34.2371;-83.8861
