3 triangle objects in Hall county GA;2020-01-03 21:50:00;10 seconds;3 triangle objects in Hall county GA I was out for my dog to putty, it was foggy outside.  Suddenly I noticed two triangle shaped objects in the horizon which were moving with constant velocity.  Each of them had a bright bluish light in the center and yellowish on two end edges.  The first two were short from each other 1 mile or less, the third one was 5 miles behind but following the same route.  All the were lost in horizon after 10 seconds.;34.2371;-83.8861
