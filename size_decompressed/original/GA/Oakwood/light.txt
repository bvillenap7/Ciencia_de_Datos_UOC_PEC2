As we came near a town called oakwood,ga a light about 3 to 5 miles away shot down at around 35 degrees, from left to right. The highway only has to the sides just trees. But the weird part was that it never hit the ground. the light apeared like a firefly does and it shot a clean even light at an estemated 35 degrees and again disapeared like i said a firefly does with its light. not a flame or any smoke was seen. it was not a plane the plane would of crashed. not a meteor or shooting star becase it was a even light so clead and shooting so cleanly. It was the clearest night sky.  It did not look like it was out of control but at a high speed very high. The light was i say the size of a van and even from front to back. the light shot the length of one side of the highway to the other side. It was a four lane highway. I saw it my brother in passenger seat saw it my girlfriend had a scare she was all nervouse all night long. None of us believed i still dont know what it was. Do u? please to calm me a bit give me an explanation. please. there was no trail or smoke. other cars saw it because when it happened other cars put the brakes on!;34.2371;-83.8861
Oakwood;2011-07-20 01:00:00;one hour;Oakwood I saw a series of lights crossing the sky in the exact direction at approximately 5-10 minutes apart.   They were small lights white/blue/red in color.   They were definitely not planes or any other recognizable aircraft.;34.2371;-83.8861
Three Bright White Lights observed in morning sky...OAKWOOD, HALL COUNTY Georgia JULY 1st.;2012-07-01 06:00:00;6 to 8 minutes;Three Bright White Lights observed in morning sky...  OAKWOOD, HALL COUNTY Georgia JULY 1st. Early morning of July 1, 2012, making the 6.4 mile normal route to my job i observed three bright white circular lights to the north of my east bound direction i was traveling.   A shower and breakfast thirty minuets earlier, had me wide awake and ready for my workday.  My first thought was that it must be stars still visable in newly lightening  dawn sky.    I continued  my normal route for another mile and could still see the three bright lights in the distance.  I then pulled into the almost empty wall mart shopping center parking lot and stopped at a point where I could view the lights with no obstructions.   The viewpoint at this time looked as if the three lights were lining up perfectly in the distance in a verticle line.  It appeared as if they were becon lights on a new super tall cellular tower or something of that nature.  Thinking for about thirty more seconds as i continued to observe the lights, that becon lights for towers are red and flash so that wasn't it.   The bright white lights dissappered all at once. I obsreved the skies in that direction for about three or four more minutes and saw nothing else, but the beautiful morning sky.  I have no idea what the objects are, or were.  I can honestly say it was very cool and made my day whatever it was.  I have lived in this area for my whole life and it was really unusual for the morning skies around here. I am forty one years old and am usually up early so it was really an event unlike I have ever observed.  Thank you;34.2371;-83.8861

At the heig;2019-05-25 21:30:00;15 + seconds;At approximately 9:30 p.m., I noticed an orange light moving in the night sky.  I could not hear any sounds coming from it.  At the height that it appeared to be, it seemed a lot larger than an airplane.  It continued moving until it changed and got smaller.  Then it disappeared.  It occurred on May 5, 2019, at approximately 9:30 p.m. and lasted 15 or more seconds.;34.2371;-83.8861
