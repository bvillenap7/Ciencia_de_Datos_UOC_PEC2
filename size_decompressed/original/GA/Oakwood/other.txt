UFO hovered, moved over us slowly, then disappeared;2007-03-03 20:00:00;About 2 minutes;UFO hovered, moved over us slowly, then disappeared During the evening of March 3, 2007, I and some friends observed a large UFO hovering over a construction site in Oakwood, Georgia. We had just finished cleaning up after a yard sale fundraiser at school and were on our way to get something for dinner when we spotted this large, flat v-shaped craft hovering low over the new Wal-Mart construction site across from the traffic light.  It had several lights of different colors spaced randomly along the bottom side--many more than would be on a typical aircraft - and it was at least 100 yards across.  It began moving overhead very slowly and didnâ€™t make any sound at all.  My friend that was sitting in the passenger seat of the car started panicking, and we sped off as soon as the light changed.  I glanced in the rear view mirror as we started down the road to see if it was still there, and it had vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));34.2371;-83.8861
