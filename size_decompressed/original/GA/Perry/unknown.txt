Bright red light flying low to the ground over a popular interstate.;2011-03-14 21:00:00;10 seconds;Bright red light flying low to the ground over a popular interstate. In March of 2011, I was riding in a bus down I-75 near Perry, Georgia, when I looked up and saw a bright red light fly low between us and a nearby cell phone tower.  It was too low and close to the road to be a helicopter or plane, and flew too perfectly horizontal to be swamp gas or a flare or firework of some kind.  It was too dark to make out any shapes of the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witnesses elects to remain totally anonymous provide no contact information.
