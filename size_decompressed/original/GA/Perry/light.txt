Me and my sister were watching tv and I got distracted by this very bright light from the sky outside our window. i was thinking ohh its just a plane since we live near a military base, but this was different.  It was VERY bright but not that large and I called my sister over and she saw it also.  We went over to the window and watched it.   It was moving very slow (like a snail in the sky) heading south then it turned and started heading west, still moving extremely slow.   It traveled a small distance then all of a sudden it just disappeared into thin air and we couldn't spot it anywhere.;32.4599;-83.7244
