Unusual objects moving parallel to I-75;2006-12-27 18:25:00;15 minutes;Unusual objects moving parallel to I-75 I was sitting observing the Sunset at approximately 6:30 p.m.(18:25) There was a jet just above the horizon leaving a contrail. The jet was traveling from North to South. I noticed at the jet's 2 o'clock position a small cirrus cloud. As I glanced at the cloud a small egg shape was travelling in front of the cloud. The shape was dark and the cloud sillouetted it well. The object was traveling North to South at about 10,000 ft. parallel to I-75. The object moved at a fast rate of speed. I was able to watch the object for about minute. It adjusted it trajectory slightly to the Southwest and I lost sight. One good comparison event happened as I watched the object: a bird flew in line of sight of the object for a second and I was able to compare and the object and bird was definately different. A minute or so after the object disappeared a small plane(single prop cessna-type) flew from the Southeast to North/Northwest at about 2500 ft. Very different shape also.  At approximately 6:40, at near the same point in the sky.(At this time I was trying to compare what I saw to other planes) a flash of light caught my eye. The flash was the setting sun reflecting off a mettalic object. I caught sight of an object very similiar to the first. Approximately 10,000 ft, traveling to the North parallel to I-75. Moving at a high rate of speed. The object slowed for a moment then sped up and I lost sight of it. I did not see anything else. Just to the Northeast is Robins Airforce Base and we see alot of jet traffic. I have seen f-15's and 16's and this was totally different from those aircraft. There was no contrails or noise with either event. I did not have a camera and the object was to small for my camera phone. Unfortunately, all I have is anecdotal.;32.4599;-83.7244
