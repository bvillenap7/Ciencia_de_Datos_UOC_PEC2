Craft was traveling on a heading of approximately 170 degrees.  Heading was checked with compasses based on horizon landmarks.  Brownish gold in color and silent.  Appeared to be a sphere with 4 small apendages attached to the center in a pattern of a square.  When first sighted on the horizon, you could only see 2 apendages but when it went overhead, you could see 4.  Shape was not fluctuating or changing like a bunch of balloons but remained steady.  It seemed lower than planes approaching Atlanta Airport.  It seemed to be travleing over 100 miles an hour.;33.584;-84.2751
