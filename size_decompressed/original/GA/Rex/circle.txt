Hovering craft near Rex Georgia.;2013-10-03 05:30:00;15 minutes;Hovering craft near Rex Georgia Me and my husband were staring at it for about two minutes thinking that it was a bright star.  But, then it moved to the left an then right and then in a bit of a zigzag southeast of our place.   My husband pointed out the Big Dipper and made a point that starts don't move unless they are falling.   The more we looked I noticed blinking green, yellow and white lights and the craft appeared to be hovering and moving left to right front to back.   I've, well we've never seen anything like this before. It's both facinating and a little scary!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
