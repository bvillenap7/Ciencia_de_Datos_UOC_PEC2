White flying cigar.;2016-11-28 06:51:00;1 minute;White flying cigar Saw a white cigar shaped craft, slowly flying over head.  Just under th clouds.  Seemed glossy white like a commercial air craft.  No markings.  It sounded like a jet and a helicopter in one.  It had two wings and 4 smaller cigar shaped what looked like engines or where a props would be.  Never seen a craft like this and once I read other people had seen something similar I wonder wtf it was/is.  The weather.....?  Weather drones....?
