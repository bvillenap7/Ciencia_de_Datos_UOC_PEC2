Extremely fast-spinning elliptical with blue spindles and red lights attached to the end.;2017-10-21 01:50:00;10 minutes;Extremely fast-spinning elliptical with blue spindles and red lights attached to the end. I was sitting outside because I remembered there was supposed to be a meteor shower and I saw a star that looked like it was twinkling, so I looked more closely and it looked like there were blue spindles with red lights attached to the end spinning extremely fast.  I thought it might have been an airplane but it was way too big and it wasn't moving from where it was.  I went inside to turn off my porch light and came back to see it more clearly.  It didn't move, just spun extremely fast in the same place.  I looked really closely at other stars to make sure I wasn't just seeing something, and I wasn't.  I think it was a circular shape but it was angled strangely, so I saw more of an oval/elliptical shape.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
