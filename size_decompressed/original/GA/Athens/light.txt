Reddish-orange glowing object, multiple witnesses, athens, GA, July 4th, possible UFO.;2008-07-04 10:00:00;4 minutes;Reddish-orange glowing object, multiple witnesses, athens, GA, July 4th, possible UFO. On July 4th at approximately 10p.m. me and my girlfriend saw a red glowing light in the sky moving suspiciously slow and somewhat low in the atmosphere.  We observed this for close to five minutes. It did not have any differentiating lights on it besides the red glow. This caused us to wonder what it was since helicopters and planes usually have other lights distinguishing it as such.  It did not make any noise.   I know of many other people who saw the same thing we did on the same night as well as witnesses to the object on different nights. There are also videos of it from different parties on youtube. They all are of the same thing, a reddish-orange glowing object.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
Red orb drops white orbs at night;2008-07-04 10:30:00;1 minute;Red orb drops white orbs at night We saw a red orb-like light in the sky.  It was moving slowly like a plane, but it was much brighter.  It was during 4th of July so we thought it may have been a firework, but it moved in a northerly direction without falling or fizzling out.  It dropped two white orbs out of the bottom that we thought were fireworks at first, but they dropped without fizzling out and much slower than a firework would fall.  The orbs continued toward the ground and then the red light kept moving for another 20-30 seconds before it disappeared.  The sky was dark but clear.  We did not see it again.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
I saw a silent orange/red pulsing light move across the sky slowly, hover, change color twice, and disgorge a smaller pulsing light.;2008-07-05 22:30:00;3-5 min;I saw a silent orange/red pulsing light move across the sky slowly, hover, change color twice, and disgorge a smaller pulsing light. I was working the Saturday night shift at the bar when a friend from the restaurant next door ran in and said that there was a ufo outside. He said he had seen the ufo for the last 4 nights. I was skeptical, but followed him out to the parking lot. In the sky to the southwest was a hazy ember-colored light moving slowly to the east. The light pulsed evey two seconds and was about the size of a pea held at arm's length. Two other restaurant workers joined us. We remained mostly silent in order to try to hear the object- at no point did we hear any sound. I tried to sight it on my camera phone but could not pick it up. After about a minute, the object turned white for about two seconds and then resumed its initial color. The light did not illuminate any structure such as wings or a gondola and never blinked. There was a fairly uniform overcast at about 2-3000 feet and at no point was the light obscured by the clouds. After moving east for a few minutes the object decelerated and hovered. At this point I called my wife and told her to look south. The light moved slightly to the north and then turned white again. A soon as it had turned white, a smaller orange/red evenly pulsing light dropped from the white light and descended at an even rate until it disappeared from view behind the treeline. About half a second after the small light disengaged from the larger one, the larger one vanished.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
Stationary or almost stationary bright red light turns white and drops a smaller red light that moves away.;2008-09-03 22:00:00;3 minutes;Stationary or almost stationary bright red light turns white and drops a smaller red light that moves away. This evening, while my neighbor and I were taking the dogs for their nightly walk, we noticed a bright red light high up in the sky. It looked similar to the red lights on radio towers, it was that bright, but it was not blinking and it seemed to be stationary, or moving very slowly. As we watched, trying to decide if it was moving by gauging its position in relation to some telephone lines, it suddenly turned very white, then a smaller red light dropped down from it. As the smaller red light dropped away, the white light disappeared, but for a few seconds both the white light above and the red light dropping away were visible. Then the white light went out and we could see nothing of it. The red light then moved away and we watched it until it passed from view. I believe the light was high in the southeastern sky, then the red light that moved away was moving east. The whole event lasted maybe three minutes from the time we noticed the bright redlight until the smaller red one passed from view.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
Ascending Orange Light;2010-11-16 19:00:00;5 seconds;Ascending Orange Light I was standing on a street corner and glanced into the Northern sky when a orange light visibly  the size a of a star appeared.  The light was ascending at a constant speed when suddenly two orange or yellow lights appeared above and below the first light.  The light below turned and traveled directly down as the light above turned and traveled  directly up--both lights disappeared simultaneously.  Once the secondary lights disappeared, the first light's speed increased and it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Close bright light with hovering trajectory in Athens, GA.;2011-10-16 21:30:00;10 minutes;Close bright light with hovering trajectory in Athens, GA. We saw a light emitting the same luminosity as a bright star, only slightly bigger than the biggest star visible on a clear night and with a very subtle yellowish hue.   The flying object passed across the sky with passenger planes behind it and the rate at which it flew and lack of flashing lights is what gained our attention.   Farther above and in the distance were passenger planes, giving us a frame of reference.  It seemed to be much closer yet flying much slower than the passenger planes and it was maintaining its flight trajectory.  Its flight pattern seemed to be a linear hovering rather than conventional flight movement. The event duration was conducive upon the obstructed visibility of the tree line.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
Bright at first and then dim. Turned to fast to be a airplane.;2013-10-26 19:00:00;5 minutes;Bright at first and then dim. Turned to fast to be a airplane. It was bright and far away southeast in the sky. It had no colored or flashing lights. It start off bright moving northeast and then turned southeast and got dimmer until the light went out.  I used my shaft phone that has sky guide app and pointed at it to see if it was a satellite but it wasn't. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
