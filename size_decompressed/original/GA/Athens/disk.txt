As I was waiting I was looking at the cloud formations because the sky was a beautiful blue and the clouds were a puffy white.  I noticed a shiny, silver colored object very high.  The clouds were very high also and the craft was above them.  It resembled an airplane initially but as the object got near a rather large puffy cloud it dipped on one side and slid into the cloud.  I watched for several minutes and it never exited the cloud.  When it dipped on one side I could see that it had a plate formation below the shiny upper portion of the craft.  I did not have binoculars so I cannot give an exact description but I would say it was very large, at least the size of a 747.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
