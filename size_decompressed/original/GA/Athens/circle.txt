One bright red curcular object descended and hovered about 1000 feet over the screen of a drive-in movie. It remained for about three minutes and then took off at great speed to the NW from which direction it had come. There were no blinking lights or contrails.

It was a Saturday night, after 9 p.m., and we were sitting on the back porch. I thought I had seen a shooting star, so we were both watching the sky for more. All of a sudden a bright ball of white light lit up the sky in front of us. It was approximately 100 feet over tree-top level. Comparitively, the UFO was about the size of a baseball in the sky. It then travelled quickly from a west to east direction at high speed, leaving a tail of light behind it like a comet. It made no audible sound. It was a wooded area we were in, so it was out of sight quickly -- we only witnessed it for a matter of seconds. We both stayed out for an hour afterwards hoping to see it again, but it never came back.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
