Pure white light flying in such a way that no earthly craft possibly could.;2021-09-02 21:00:00;10 seconds;Pure white light flying in such a way that no earthly craft possibly could. A bright white light flying relatively low to the ground flew halfway through my observable sky from the cover of the tree line behind me at a tremendous speed, proceeding to take an almost perfect hard 90Â° left turn without slowing down at all and then vanishing out of my line of sight at an unfathomable speed. All of this occurred without the craft making any sound whatsoever.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
