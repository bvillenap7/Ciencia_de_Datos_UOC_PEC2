I scrambled for my phone, by the time I got it out, there were four lights, in a diamond pattern. I took 3 pictures in rapid succesion, as I went to take the fourth, all 4 shot up into the sky and disappeared.  There was a bright streak of light as they rapidly ascended.  As I was taking the pictures, I noticed they moved closer together, before shooting off into the sky.  They made absolutely no audible sound whatsoever. Just vanished. I was skeptical about the idea at first, but having seen it first hand now, I believe.  No question, whatever I saw did NOT originate on this planet.  Very unsettling.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
