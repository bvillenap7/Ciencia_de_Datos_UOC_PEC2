Black Triangle in athens Ga 3 in the morning moving slowly in a south eastern direction over mckey court Athens GA;2001-09-01 03:00:00;2-3 minutes;Black Triangle in athens Ga 3 in the morning moving slowly in a south eastern direction over mckey court Athens GA I was outside my house on Mckey court, Athens, Ga at about 3 in the morning I dont remember the date pretty sure it was in Fall 2001.I was smoking a cigarette on the back porch when I heard a very low frequency droning sound.  I looked up and saw a red light begin to appear from over the roof. I am not sure how high this thing was but I looked huge it covered the whole sky over head . If it were an aircraft it would have fallen out of the sky,   As it moved overhead in  a southeastern direction very slowly. I could see that it was triangle shaped and  had large red lights at each tip of the triangle and one in the middle.  It made no sound accept for the very low pitch droning. Seriously it was almost inaudible. It made its way overhead and I could see the back end of it had three red lights like the ones in the bottom on the rear of it.  The lights glowed red like the moon on a lunar eclipse or like the plasma engines in star trek really weird. that’s about it i! t moved really slowly went past the tree line and out of sight.  I don’t have and photo’s or anything but I can draw it and send it in an email or something.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
the only thing you could see was 3 lights in the shape of a triangle, floating slowly over a field near some houses.;2003-09-28 01:30:00;about 1 min.;((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed the three satellites that fly in formation, which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite surveillance system.  PD)) the only thing you could see was 3 lights in the shape of a triangle, floating slowly over a field near some houses. OK, THIS IS KIND OF ODD FOR ME TO BE WRITTING THIS, BECAUSE IM NOT REALLY THE KIND OF PERSON WHO BELIEVES IN UFOS, BUT THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IVE SEEN THIS THING. ONCE I SAW IT IN MY HOME TOWN, AND IT WAS NEAR THE INTERSTATE, PEOPLE WERE PULLING TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THAT NIGHT TO LOOK AT IT. IT MOVES TOO SLOW TO BE A PLANE. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY IT MOVES MORE LIKE A BLIMP OR SOMETHING. IT DOESNT MAKE ANY NOISE, AND YOU CAN ONLY SEE 3 LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM OF IT IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE. INFACT IT WENT RIGHT OVER THE TOP OF ME AND MY YOUNGER BROTHER AND A FEW MORE PEOPLE WONDERING WHAT THE HELL IT WAS. THAT WAS ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO. TONIGHT ON MY WAY HOME I SAW THE EXACT SAME THING OVER A FIELD NEAR ATHENS. BUT THIS TIME THERE WAS ONLY A FEW CARS EVEN IN SIGHT, AND I WAS ALONE. NO ONE WAS PULLING OVER THIS TIME THOUGH, SO MAYBE I WAS THE ONLY ONE PAYING IT ANY ATTENTION. THE SKY WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR, BUT, STILL THE ONLY THING I COULD SEE WAS THE 3 LIGHTS IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE. I STARTED TO SLOW DOWN TO SEE IF I WAS REALLY SEEING WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS SEEING. IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME THE LIGHTS WENT OUT, AND I NEVER SAW ANYTHING ELSE. I KNOW IT WAS ALMOST 2 AM WHEN I SAW IT, BUT IM NOT TIRED, I HAVENT BEEN DRINKING, OR DOING ANY DRUGS, BUT IM ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE I SAW WHAT I SAW, AGAIN!;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881

Black triangular craft hovered without noise then was gone.;2012-05-01 19:30:00;00:01;Black triangular craft hovered without noise then was gone I was at a stop sign and when I was looking for traffic something caught my gaze at the corner of my eye.  I looked up and at the height of a tall tree was a solid and black triangular aircraft.  It didn't have any wing engines like passenger planes have. It had bright white lights on the bottom lining the edge of the bottom.  The lights were big and didn't blink.  The whole object was about the length of a pickup truck and at the widest part was about as wide as it was long.  I looked away for a second to a nearby bus stop and two other people were looking up at what I was.  I don't know who they were so I can't give their contact information but they were pointing and looking up at it.  It hovered for about a minute and then banked to the right and it was gone in seconds.  I had my windows down and it didn't make any noise.

Triangle-shaped object the size of a go-kart with blue/white lights.;2013-10-03 00:10:00;5 minutes;Triangle-shaped object the size of a go-kart with blue/white lights. My wife and I were driving back from her dad's office along Gaines School just after midnight when she saw some slow-moving lights a few blocks away.  I figured it was an airplane or something, but as we got closer it stopped moving entirely.  So when we got alongside it, I pulled into the parking lot where K-Mart used to be.   As we got closer, it seemed no bigger than a go-kart, with 3 bright blue-white lights forming a triangle.  I pulled underneath it, and it was up, maybe 150 ft. in the air, but the instant we got under it, the object started to move north.  At this point, we assumed it must be some kind of remote-controlled aircraft (with lights?) and looked for someone operating it as we drove.  We saw no one.  It began to move faster and I continued through the long strip mall drive following behind it.  We lost sight of it when it went over the Jittery Joe's, but by the time I got on the other side, it was completely gone.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
