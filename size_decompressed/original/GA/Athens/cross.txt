Red Sky over Georgia;2005-08-11 19:00:00;5 min.;Red Sky over Georgia I was watching TV around 7:30 PM EST in north east Georgia.  My youngest daughter came running in the house saying come look!   I got up and went to the back door with her to see what she wanted.  The whole yard was a bright orange / red color It looked like you had a red spot light on the yard.  I called my wife to come see.  She said get the camera we need to take a picture of this!  After I got back outside and looked up the sky was glowing red and looked like what I had seen in pictures of the northern lights. Red glowing and streaks of dark and light red moving across the sky in kind of like waves. It moved from NW to SE over the house in about 5 min.  It was like it was being pushed across as the sky it turned back to dark blue behind it.   We took pictures off the back porch and some more from the side yard as we live in the woods we wanted a better view.  There were some clouds in the area about 25 to 30 miles away and it had just started getting dark but the sky over us was mostly clear but no stars could be seen yet.  We can back inside after it was over to put the pictures on the computer as we had never seen anything like this before.  I have lived here all my live (40 years) and never seen anything like this!  We put the pictures on the computer and started looking at them.  It was then that we found we had not only had taken a picture of the red weird glowing sky, but also something (looks like a triangle craft in the blowup of one of the pictures) moving with the red glow.  I have 3 -4 pictures taken with a 5mp digital camera SVP type that shows the craft as it moved closer/larger in each picture.  The last one you can see it very well as it is glowing yellow in the red glow.  We went back out to see if it was a star or something but no stars could be seen.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
