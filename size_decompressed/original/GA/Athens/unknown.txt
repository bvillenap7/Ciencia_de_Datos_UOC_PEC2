My brother and I were looking at this solid red light moving very slowly across the sky. It took about 8 minutes before it disappeared. There was a few times where some white lights fell off of the red one and almost instantly disappeared. There was also a time where a piece fell off and then it turned orange and split into pieces again, then it had disappeared.  At one point you can actually see an airplane fly in the same frame as the red light.;33.9463829076627;-83.4102694007881
