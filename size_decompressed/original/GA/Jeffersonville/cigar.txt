Flying glo-stick;2005-02-12 23:00:00;5 sec;Flying glo-stick While sitting by a campfire in rural central Georgia, I looked up to gaze at the stars when an object that appeared to be about the size of a bird appeared. It was a flourescent green object similar to a glow-stick. The light appeared and traveled at a very high rate of speed about 30 feet over my head. It probably went 40 to 50 feet from my right to left. The light then just vanished. I have no idea what it was. It was too close to ground to be a meteor crossing the sky. It seemed as if it were just above the tree tops. I could clearly see the outline of the object to be a small cigar shape.;32.7424;-83.387
