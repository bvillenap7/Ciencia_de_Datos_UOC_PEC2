V-shaped object with brite white lights running all under it. Flying East to West;1999-03-03 21:00:00;2 minutes;V-shaped object with brite white lights running all under it. Flying East to West I went outside to walk my dog @ approx 9:00 looked up at sky & saw a small plane (could tell plane because it had the familiar white on one side red on the other blinking).  Then out of the clouds, I saw what I believed to be a large plane descend straight down & glide across overhead traveling from East to West.  It made no noise & was large & V-shaped. Lots of big bright white lights running underneath its V-shape. Tried to get someone from in my house out to look at it before it was gone.  By the time anyone else came out with me, it was gone.;34.4801;-83.7856
dragonfly shaped light;2010-06-13 23:15:00;10 minutes;dragonfly shaped light My boyfriend and I were standing on our back porch around 11:15pm on June 13, 2010.  My boyfriend said to me do you see that faint glow in the north west direction of the sky?  It was very low and at the tree line of our landlords home.  It was about 10 miles from the actual sight, but the size of it made it look closer.  It was bigger than the moon from our view.  We looked eye level with it, it never went over us, it just stayed in the same area. The faint glow turned into a bright orange-white dragonfly shaped, very very bright beam.  It had a body &  tail like a dragonfly without wings.  It zig zagged back and forth slowly for about 10 minutes before turning back into a faint glow and finally disappearing.;34.4801;-83.7856
