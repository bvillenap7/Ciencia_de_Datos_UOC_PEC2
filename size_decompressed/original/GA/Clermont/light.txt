I was on my way home from a town just north from my house by about 5 miles when i got within a mile from my road and saw something very strange in the sky nearly above where my house is positioned.  I couldn't tell for sure how far away it was from me but it seemed just farther than my house and above the small town nearest to where i live about a mile south from me.  I saw it and thought, Wow!  That is a huge shooting star! but I realized within a second that it was stationary and many different bright colored lights all together in a ball. It was getting close to around 7 p.m. and in August it is still fairly light that time of day in the summer, but it was growing dusky.  So, this bright ball of light was very pronounced in the sky as it was incredibly bright compared to the rest of the sky.  I would say it was like a bunch of colored lights all melded together and rapidly changing because there is no other way to describe it.  I immediately grew very nervous becuase it was so large.  It was about the size of a baseball to me from around 2 miles away.  I had a friend in the car with me and she saw it as well.  We both stared at the object until all of a sudden it rapidly fell or flew or by some means moved very quickly downward to the right and then vanished.  I have never in my life seen anything like this before or after.  The only conclusion I could come out of it with was that it was some sort of UFO.;34.4801;-83.7856
