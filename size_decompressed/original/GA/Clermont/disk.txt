Wish we knew what it was.. No noise at all. It stayed just North Northwest of our house for about 45 minutes then very slowly traveled north towards maybe Dahlonega GA? We do not believe this to be any other type of plane we ever saw before. My husband, daughter & I saw this object. Nxt time will travel to see if I can see more. Wish others would report if they also saw it.  Would really like to know what it was... We were on the back porch. Husband told me to get binoculars, saw other planes traveling in sky (very clear nite) but none too near this object which was very low in horizon to the north - northwest of us.  It was not that far away, but w/ binoculars it looked like a round, flat, circular object w/windows of light. No sound & traveling extremely slowly. I think for a while (30 min) it just stayed in the same place.  We watched it for about 45 minutes until it finally did move off to the north - northwest towards maybe Dahlonega in Lumpkin County, I think. My husband, daughter & I all saw this object.;34.4801;-83.7856
