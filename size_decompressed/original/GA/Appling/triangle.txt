Two triangular objects just above the tree line.;2009-01-28 22:00:00;15 minutes;Two triangular objects just above the tree line. This just happen!   My son & I walked outside from our house & instantly noticed two bright white light formations just above the tree line to the east of our home.  My son went to the garage bonus room & brought out his girlfriend to witness what we were seeing.  The objects were clearly triangular in shape, made no noise at all, & no movement.  I walked inside to retrive my cell phone as to take a picture in which I did but they look like faint white lights at best.  I called my daughter whom was upstairs yet before she could make it out side we watched these objects rise about a 1/2 mile straight up & then shoot of to the right at a speed that I can only explain as immpossible.
