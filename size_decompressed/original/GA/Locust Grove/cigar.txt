Cigar ufo over Locust Grove,Ga.;2007-06-07 00:00:00;2-3 minutes;Cigar ufo over Locust Grove,Ga. I had set up my telescope in front yard for star gazing. I usually set up on back porch, but the dog would not co-operate times prior. Went back inside to get note pad & calculator etc. looked up & this craft started to appear... it was so low to the groung I thought it was toughing the top of the tree line. I was shall I say bewildered. It was a crystal clear night. This cigar shaped ufo was 300 ft long & 75 to 100 ft. width with a row of brilliant yellow light down the length of the side. It was barely moving, but no noise, no wind blowing leaves on trees underneath. It was right over my head. It gets a little fuzzy after that. I woke up the next morning in all my clothes & telescope still in front yard. I remember the time, month & year, but not the day. I cant remember if my daughter was home or not.I can remember watching it moving away from me though. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
