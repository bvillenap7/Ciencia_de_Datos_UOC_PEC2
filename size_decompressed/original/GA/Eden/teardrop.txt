Green teardrop splits in two and flies off at incredibly high speed;2008-07-13 23:00:00;3 seconds;Green teardrop splits in two and flies off at incredibly high speed Three members of my family and I were sitting on my front porch with the light off.  The sky was clear with few clouds and the moon was almost full.  We were sitting in a half circle when I happened to look into the sky.  I saw a green light shaped almost like a teardrop with a green aura coming off of it moving at an incredibly fast speed. I pointed to it as it shot out from behind some trees. Everyone saw it. My first thought was that it might be a falling star but I’ve seen a couple of falling stars and this thing seemed different. First off, it was neon green. It didn’t just have a greenish tint it was the color of a lime. As we were watching the green light, it split in two and flew off into the sky leaving behind a line of smoke from where it had came from. The trail stayed in the sky for just a couple of minutes before it vanished.;32.1756;-81.402
