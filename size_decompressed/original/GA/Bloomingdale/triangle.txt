Triangle shaped silver object hovering 100ft above tree line on Hwy 80 tilted downward and shot off;2008-03-03 21:45:00;5 minutes;Triangle shaped silver object hovering 100ft above tree line on Hwy 80 tilted downward and shot off Driving down Hwy 80, saw triangle shaped object with lights on the points of the triangle. Was hovering above the trees approxitametly 100ft.Silver looking in color, I rolled down the window and could hear a low humming noise. I turned around and as I did it tilted in a downward motion and then shot off. I had a similar sighting about 2-3 weeks ago on I-16 on the way home, but had thought I was seeing things. This time I am 100% sure of what I saw.  Once I arrived home I looked out into the night sky and saw a flickering light up in the sky.   Defintely not an airplane, because it remained still. It was changing colors, emitting an amber glow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));32.1201;-81.3049
