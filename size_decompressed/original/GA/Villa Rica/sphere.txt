I zoomed in on a particularly odd r I was filming the clouds over villa rica because I kept seeing ufo holes in the clouds.  I zoomed in on a particularly odd rainbow.  The rainbow had a very large orb nested within the clouds.  It had a large opening at the base and what appeared to be port holes around the top portion of the orb.  It actually looked as if the sunlight was refracting off of gasses that it was emitting.  The colors were pink and teal.  Photos and video secured.;33.7224;-84.9303
