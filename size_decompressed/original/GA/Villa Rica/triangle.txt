A buddy and I were on the way to Atlanta.  When we got on I-20 coming from the Carrollton/Villa Rica exit, I immediately asked him what we’re these three lights sitting directly over the interstate and not seeming to move at all. The three lights moved slowly to the right side of the road and at this point we started trying to rule out any and all explanations. The lights then started moving over the interstate and we got a full visual of the shape.  There was three bright white lights with small lights leading to the center.   After we noticed the first three crafts we also noticed two more of the same crafts flying off into the distance.  Although the three original crafts were still together they started to make formations.  The first formation was a perfect triangle of the triangle ships over the Lee road exit.  We lost sight because of the trees shortly after we got to around six flags.  This formation of the same three crafts was in a perfectly straight line with two of the crafts heading towards Atlanta and one was heading back towards the the Lee Road exit. I thought about this until my head literally hurt and I’m still lost at to what we saw.;33.7224;-84.9303
