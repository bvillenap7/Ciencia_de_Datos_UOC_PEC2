14 Fire balls at a very high altitude with very little movement red and yellow in color Seen from West Ga USA;2010-10-03 16:30:00;15 min;14 Fire balls at a very high altitude with very little movement red and yellow in color Seen from West Ga USA We were tossing a ball with our son about 6:30 PM. We had plenty of bright daylight which made this seem kind of odd. We live just 35 miles west of Atlanta, Ga. we see lots of aircraft from the airport and we are amazed at the number of flights coming in most days. This was most assuredly NOT a plane or even a single craft. The sky was very clear and I don’t recall a cloud in sight. I glanced upward kind of in a southern direction and saw what I thought at first was a star and immediately realized it was not a star as my understanding is that stars twinkle so then I thought a planet and it must be Jupiter since it had been in the news that it was very close. Keep in mind these thoughts flooded my mind in just a couple of seconds. As I was processing what I was seeing I realized that I could see a cluster and to my amazement  a geometric shape took place and I was really not believing my eyes at this point. The shape “connecting the dots” so to speak would have been a six pointed star. All of the other “Fire balls” were somewhat inside of the main area. I had a tough time with the count because at least two of them seemed to be interacting or moving very closely together this movement was very obvious to me but all the others either had no movement or it was undetectable. Also most of the “fire balls” were yellow but several of them maybe four or five were red or orange in color but had the same shape and size as well as amount of light intensity. It became harder to see the objects as time went so I would say the faded rather than moved in a horizontal direction. But the main star outline remained the entire time. My wife came over to where I was standing and said she could see about five of them. I went in to get my camera and when I returned I had a hard time getting my eyes to focus at first but I did see them again but my photo did not show what I had hoped and so I have no other evidence. I would like to add that if this had happened at night it may well have went unnoticed to the untrained eye, namely me. We know we saw something but as to what we could not really say. UFO or US military makes no matter to me because I have never seen anything like it before. I do hope I get the pleasure again.;33.7224;-84.9303
FIVE PEOPLE SAW 10 TO 13 FIREBALLS LOOKING LIKE FLAMES THE SIZE OF A SMALL AIRCRAFT WITH NO SOUND FLYING BY AT EVEN INTERVALS.;2014-05-17 21:00:00;>5 minutes;FIVE PEOPLE SAW 10 TO 13 FIREBALLS LOOKING LIKE FLAMES THE SIZE OF A SMALL AIRCRAFT WITH NO SOUND FLYING BY AT EVEN INTERVALS. MYSELF AND FOUR OTHER PEOPLE SAW THESE - THERE WERE AT LEAST 10-13 AND MAYBE MORE BALLS OF FIRE MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE TREETOPS ABOVE LAKE TARA, VILLA RICA, GA, AT 9 PM SAT MAY 17TH FROM EAST TO SOUTH...  THEY MADE NO NOISE AND IT WAS SILENT WITH A CLOUDLESS DARK SKY AND NO MOON.   STANDING ON MY BALCONY, THE FIREBALLS MOVED AT EVEN INTERVALS APPEARING OUT OF THE TALL PINE TREES ON THE LEFT AND DISAPPEARING BEHIND THE TALL PINES ON THE RIGHT, TRAVELING SLOWLY JUST BEYOND THE BOAT DOCK, THEY APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL AIRCRAFT, BUT NO SOUND EMANATING FROM THEM.   LOOKING LIKE FLAMES, MY CAMERA SHOWS THEM TO BE ROUND.  ONE PICTURE WAS TAKEN WITH THE ZOOM.  THE OTHER PICTURE ENLARGED ON A COMPUTER SHOWS A FIREBALL WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE A CAPITAL LETTER N IN THE MIDDLE.  THREE PEOPLE SAW THESE FROM THIS ADDRESS.  A PHONE CALL WAS MADE TO A NEARBY NEIGHBOR AND TWO OTHER WITNESSES AT THAT ADDRESS SAW THEM ALSO.;33.7224;-84.9303
