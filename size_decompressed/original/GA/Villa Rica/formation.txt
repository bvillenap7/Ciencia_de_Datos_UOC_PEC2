Video taken and one picture.;2013-11-28 21:00:00;3:29;Video taken and one picture. While sitting outside with my daughter my dogs became alerted to something in the skies, I don't think they even knew what they heard, it alerted us to look out when we saw a stream of lights come from the west just above the horizon, at least 5 of them trailing in and up in the sky.  They were amber colors bigger and brighter than planes.   They then flickered in and out of the sky (no clouds sky is clear) making the shape of a triangle the quickly making a slanted line and then disappear would one or more â€¦ 5 then 4 then only 2 lined up and down.. then planes came from the east.  One plane went to the top and one plane went under the lighted object ..  as the planes flew towards one object took off down to the horizon as if hiding.   My daughter was afraid of what she saw she is 21 yrs old.  I have some of this on my tablet video, it is the oddest sight and I can't stop looking out the window to see if they are back;33.7224;-84.9303
