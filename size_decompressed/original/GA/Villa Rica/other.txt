Driving north on highway 61 toward Dallas.  Saw object right side of highway approximately 1/4 mile ahead.  Was moving horizontally just above a group of pine trees.  Object was moving fast and descending slightly.  Object was circular, metallic and smooth with no creases visible.  Was shiny silver in color.  Looked for object again when I got to area where seen but saw no sign.  Mostly rural area but there were a few houses nearby.  Based on distance estimate object approximately 10-15 ft in diameter and 6-8 ft in height. Shape was like a wash tub turned upside down or a crown.  Object was not an airplane since it had no wings or landing gear.  Object was not floating like a balloon and there was no wind to propel a balloon at the speed this object was moving.  This is a fairly well travelled road but I noticed no other cars at the time.  Would be interested to know if anyone else saw this object.;33.7224;-84.9303
