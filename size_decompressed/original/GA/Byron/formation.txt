They went in a line and at one point three of them moved into a triangular formation.  Eventually they faded out into the horizon.   Thinking they were done we looked away.  About that time more began to come across the sky.  This lasted for about 15-20 minutes.   Someone else must have seen this.  Also there was not any noise coming from the objects.;32.6181;-83.7890000000001
