For the past 3 weeks every time I go out onto my porch at night, I see a flashing light.  It flashes from red to blue, sometimes a greenish and yellow color.  The first time I witnessed it, it was a very intense blue and red.  I noticed that it would randomly seem as though it just 'went out'.  Also I noticed that it was not stationary.  It would move up , above the pine trees in my neighbors yard.  My brother, and my boyfriend were on the porch with me as well.  They really did not pay it any attention.  They just glanced up and chalked to up to be a dying star or something.  About three days ago I was sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette, when I saw it again this time it was moving to the right.  I was watching it for about 2-3 minutes when it literally shot straight up and vanished.   Today is my 22nd birthday so my boyfriend and I stayed up basically all night.  This time he actually noticed it and saw how it was not only flashing but it was moving.  He seemed utte! rly shocked at what he was witnessing.  We watched the object for at least 45 minutes.  Also I dark markings on my toes that are not coming off.  It looks like brake dust or something it is really odd.   Tonight I am going to start documenting this events.;32.6181;-83.7890000000001
