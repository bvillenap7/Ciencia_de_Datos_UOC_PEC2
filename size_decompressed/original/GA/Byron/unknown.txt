One higher than the other,thought they were drones, but after a hour,I knew they could not be.the lower one had a red dot on the side of it.  i was standing my drive way watching,and a passing car with its head lights pointing at me before turning from the road across me lite me up the craft was lower like it was coming at me and then 10/20 seconds was back to its spot.  But i never seen its movement .  When it was lower i could see like a leg of the craft from its light making a shawdow.  But this thing saw me an move toward me so fast but stop. The top one i guess was guessing two times of a crop duster flight, the other one just under it ..when the lower one came down it was about as high as a crop duster .  The top one i never saw move.  Their lights were so bright ,  never seen anything like that before.  Never once did i hear a sound.;32.6181;-83.7890000000001
