White circular formation with staggered multiple flashing white lights.;2011-03-08 03:00:00;3 min;White circular formation with staggered multiple flashing white lights. Left my house in Midway GA, at 0300AM 03/11/2011 to go to work.  It was a nice clear sky as I looked up to check on weather clouds, plenty of stars out.  I looked to the North and noticed a formation of flashing lights not in sequence in a circular formation at about a 30 degree angle of view and a single flashing light trailing the circular formation.  I would say about a dozen lights or so. There was a pattern of the flashing white lights that appeared to be those of white NAV lights of airplanes or helicopters.  The single trailing light was close to the formation at first and as I kept watching for about 3 minutes until the circular formation disappeared behind the trees the single trailing light trailed even further traveling in the same path.  They were moving relatively slow to be airplanes. I would say the formation and trailing light were at high altitude and rather far from my location I would guess 30 miles or so towards the Savannah area.  I am prett! y sure they were not military helicopters or aircraft as they were just white lights and no red or green.  I was a crew chief on helicopters in the army and flying NVG there would be no lights on aircraft or if flying unaided all lights would be on including the green and red.  Formation flying in that formation I have never done was usually staggered left or right or V formation. I canâ€™t explain what I have seen but I have not seen anything like this.;31.8052;-81.3882
