It was a clear night and I could see all of the stars. I watched a helicopter pass. This is common because at my dad's house we live under the military's flight path between bases and it is used every day. these aircraft normally approach our house from the West, turn above our home and depart to North. The chopper was doing just that. Except it was going much faster than normal. Not to far behind it was a plane. I couldn't tell what kind as it was dark outside. The plane was obviously going to pass the helicopter eventually but it was to far behind it for me to see it when it would pass it becoase it would already be out of sight by then. What was behind it was what is strange. A triangle shaped craft. It was perfectly silent and was speeding toward the plane. But it was still to far behind the plane for me to still hear the plane's engine(s). The craft had three sides all the same length. It had white strobe lights on each of the corners and one red strobe light in the center on the bottom. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.
