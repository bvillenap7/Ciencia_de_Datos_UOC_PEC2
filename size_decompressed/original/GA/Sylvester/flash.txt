Shooting Star or UFO?  ((anonymous report));2017-04-12 20:15:00;2 minutes;Shooting Star or UFO? While traveling north on Highway 33, I noticed what seemed to be a falling star.  Being that I've seen a ton of falling stars before, I expected this one to fade out.  It didn't fade immediately.  The altitude of this object was much lower than any falling star I've seen.  Once I had my eyes locked on it, it sped across a field.  It disappeared briefly, and out of nowhere, it was on the other side of the field.  It then change direction in mid flight, and zoomed back in the opposite direction.  I lose sight of it after that.
