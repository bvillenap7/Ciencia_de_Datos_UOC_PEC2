Looked like and airplane w/o wings, was there for a few seconds and the vanished into thin air!! My dad and his two brothers were working outside around 12 to 12:30 and they seen an object that looked like an airplane but with no wings. He said that it looked silver, but he is not exactly sure and that you could see the windows and the sun was giving a glare on it. He and his brothers were watching an airplane way up in the sky, he didnt really know why the airplane caught there attention, but then out of no where an object appeard and then it was gone. It was higher than the airplane and the airplane was about as high as one can get. The object was way bigger and it looked like it was gonna hit the plane, but it was above the plane. He said it was only there for a few seconds, about 4, and poof, it was gone. He said it was like it just vanished into thin air. It was the coolest thing that he ever saw and if it were not for his two brothers who also seen it, he said it would be hard for even him to believe!!!;30.9898;-83.8761
