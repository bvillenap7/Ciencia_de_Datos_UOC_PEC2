Almost three year's ago I had just started sky watching as a pastime hobby.  So I did not think anything of it at the time.Being a newbie to sky watching I thought maybe I had been shaking the camera a little, which could have caused light of a star to blur and be all over the place.  This past week I was going over a lot of my photo's and recording's from the past couple of year's and I came across these picture's of these lit up UFO's.  I have poured over them all from Oct.17, 2016.  Now after two year's of observing and recording all kind's of unexplained craft and or possible drone's.  I now know that what I photographed was some sort of craft or device stationary in the air.  I photographed these UFO's in different direction's. that evening I photographed some in the west, east,south,and south east. Yes I know this report is almost three year's later b! ut recently I was watching a UFO show on t.v. and saw these same looking type UFO's someone else in the U.S.A captured also.  Also i had previously reported this to M.U.F.O.N. at approx. the two year mark from the actual film time which I spoke about above.  Maybe someone can look these peculiar.;30.9898;-83.8761
