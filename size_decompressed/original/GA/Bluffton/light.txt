I’ve seen these light before 4 times over 2 years. First i though it was maybe a jet reflecting the sunset or either a satellite. I don't think its either now. There are no flashing lights or sounds. The other times i saw the red light it was usually low on the horizon in the south or west sky with little to no movement while dimming and brighten. I’ve also seen it disappear and reappear. I even had a chance to view it with my telescope and it looked the same. It looks like a star through the telescope but brightens and dims. my girlfriend has also witnessed the strange light.
