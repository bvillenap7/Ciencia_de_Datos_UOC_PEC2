It was the most amazing and skeptic turning event of my life.;2011-07-03 21:15:00;4-5 minutes;It was the most amazing and skeptic turning event of my life. My family and I were outside shooting off bottle rockets... my daughter and I were just sitting back and watching when she pointed out two large redish tiger blood maybe color spheres.  They were heading north north east, our family began running down the road we live on to catch up with them.  As they reached the clearing a third one caught up to them and they continued on into the tree line.  Two more where coming up into the clearing behind the three that had disappeared.  They lingered in the clearing about a min to two mins where they either began to fade or fly away and then they disappeared right before our eyes.  As they were starting to get smaller a commercial jet flew a little beneath them.  There were many people gathered in the streets watching all of this occur.  To begin with the ones we first witness were approx half the size of a full moon... as they traveled they became smaller.;33.8332;-84.6031000000001

Five flying red spheres above Mableton, GA;2011-07-03 21:15:00;4-5 minutes;Five flying red spheres above Mableton, GA On the night of July 3rd, 2011, my family was outside standing in our driveway.  At approximately 21:15 EST my daughter asked if we could see the red lights behind the treeline.  The sky was not completely dark at this time.  We began to observe to the direct northern sky, two red, sphere like objects that seemed to be moving to the northeast.  At the time they were fairly large, similar to a silver dollar if held up to the sky.   As they passed the treeline there was a third identical object that began to catch up to them.  These three objects continued to the northeast and just disappeared into the distance.  While the first three objects began to disappear two more were seen coming from the west.  They were intense red in color and identical to the initial sighting.   They continued along the same path as if they were following the first three objects. During the time the last two objects were heading northeast, we could see a plane that was in the sky which appeared to be lower than the objects we were observing.  We walked further down the street to get a better view.  By this time the neighbors began to come out into the street to observe these strange lights.  The final two lights appeared to stop in the distance and then just disappear. We have seen the chinese lamps before and these did not look anything like those. My wife, daughter and her boyfriend all observed these lights together.  We are a normal family that has not seen anything like this before.  I am an IT System Administrator my wife is going to school to be a psychologist and our daughter is 15 years old. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness and he seemed to us to be quite credible.  His description of his sighting was objective, and we presented cogently.  We suspect that the source is an excellent witness.  PD));33.8332;-84.6031000000001
