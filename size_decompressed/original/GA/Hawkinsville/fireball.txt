Two fireballs parallel to each other, with one stopping and the other moving in zigzag pattern.;2014-10-31 19:30:00;20-30 seconds;Two fireballs parallel to each other, with one stopping and the other moving in zigzag pattern. While traveling south on U.S. 341 from Perry towards Hawkinsville, I observed two fireballs heading in a southeast direction. Initially, there was one fireball, but within a couple of seconds, another appeared parallel to it and to the left.  The first fireball that appeared then ceased movement and remain stationary, while the other fireball began moving in a uniform zigzag pattern. After ceasing movement, the first fireball seamed to fade, and the second fireball move towards the location where the first fireball had been.  The second fireball then disappeared as well. They both had long ‘tails’, and looked like actual fire, not just light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));32.275;-83.4981
