Bright light appears and then vanishes in mid Georgia two consecutive mornings.;2015-06-07 05:30:00;5 seconds;Bright light appears and then vanishes in mid Georgia two consecutive mornings Having coffee on my patio and observed object in the eastern sky.  Object appeared suddenly and was very bright.  Round in shape and resembled the stars around it but was much closer and lower to horizon.  I have seen meteors before and this object was not a meteor.  It was moving fairly slow to the north and in a straight line (not falling).  I watched for about 5 seconds and then it just vanished.  It did not speed away, it was just no longer there.   This event repeated again on Monday 06/08/15 everything was exactly the same, except it occurred about 6:00 just before daybreak.;32.275;-83.4981
Object appeared to be a star for 30 minutes then moved.;2016-09-15 05:00:00;90 seconds;Object appeared to be a star for 30 minutes then moved. My sighting occurred one morning in mid-September 2016.  I’ve been so bus, I keep putting off writing this, but realize I should still make the report.   I live about 30 minutes west of an air force base.  I know commercial and private air craft have blinking lights, so I discount those.  I occasionally see lights that don’t blink but I assume military aircraft aren't required to have blinking lights?  So I discount those unless an extreme maneuver or other highly strange activity is noted.  Therefore, the only other report I ever made was 06/2015 about a bright flash just after day break that appeared from nowhere and then vanished.                                                                      For this report , as most days, I woke up early and had coffee on my patio which faces east.  I was on my patio about 430 am and star gazing as usual.  Nothing strange or eventful, plenty of stars out including 4 bright ones that were 10 degrees south east of straight up.   About 5 am, movement caught my eye,  What I thought was one of the stars began to move at a medium pace and crossed the sky traveling south east to north west and was out of sight in about 90 seconds.  It was one of the 4 brighter stars I noted when I first sat down and seemed to be same height as the other 3 stars.  It had been motionless about 30 minutes.
