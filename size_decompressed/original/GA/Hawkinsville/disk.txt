Each one had different colored lights on them . They spun in a circle and then one by one they dissapeared in a flash of multi colored light. ((NUFORC Note:  The description makes us wonder whether the incident might have been the result of an advertising light in the vicinity.  We are not certain that is the explanation, however.
