Unmoving Fireball with smoketrail UNDER it.;2003-06-01 22:00:00;8 minutes;Unmoving Fireball with smoketrail UNDER it. I saw a fireball in the sky but it wasn't moving. It had a trail of what I think is smoke underneath it. If it was something that was falling, I would imagine the smoke would be above the fireball.  I was driving and was afraid to stop on the road alone. It was over part of Fort Stewart Army Base so when I got home I called them to make them aware of it. At first, I thought it was a helicopter on fire but it never moved.  Later that week, my ex husband's friend (also a US soldier) saw the same exact thing from his home.
