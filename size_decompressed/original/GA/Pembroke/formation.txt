String of 5 to 6 equidistant red to orange lights moving north east across I-16 above Pembroke, Georgia, near Ash Branch Road exit.;2015-10-20 20:00:00;10 minutes;String of 5 to 6 equidistant red to orange lights moving north east across I-16 above Pembroke, Georgia, near Ash Branch Road exit. I was traveling westbound on I-16, just west of I-95, on a very clear and star-filled evening around 7:55 pm.  Rather low to the horizon, I spotted a moving row of blinking lights similar to small airplane lights.  I was curious as to how the 5 to 6 planes were traveling so precisely one right after the other and as I got closer I realized they weren't airplanes but flashing lights of some kind.  I exited I-16 at Ash Branch Road to try and get better view.  It was as if they were on a string equidistant from one another.  The row of lights was traveling north west to south east over I-16.  Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield are in the general vincinity. This had little soto the north to north east direction.;32.1807;-81.6646
