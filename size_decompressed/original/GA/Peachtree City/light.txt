This object was not a star, plane, or helicopter!  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a possible sighting of Sirius, but that is a guess.  PD));2005-04-23 23:00:00;approx 30 minutes;This object was not a star, plane, or helicopter! I always look at the stars on clear nights when I can, and that's just what I was doing the other night.   I noticed an object which was slightly brighter than the rest of the stars which I thought might have been a planet.  Most of the time it was white but it would at times seem to have blue and red in it.  It was very far up in the sky I'd say at least 40,000 feet.  But it moved unlike a star would or a plane for that matter.  It would move in very small movements from left to right and up and down.  So slight I could hardly tell it was moving but it was because I would stand still and after a minute or two it would move behind a tree branch out of site.   The object also would dim to NOTHING!  Then light up again.   Like nothing I've ever seen.  It gave me a weird feeling as I was watching it.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a possible sighting of Sirius, but that is a guess.

Bright object dimmed then vanished in sunset, retained position in sky until sun went down then faded away.;2014-10-09 06:30:00;2-3 hours;Bright object dimmed then vanished in sunset, retained position in sky until sun went down then faded away. Husband was at work in Newnan, saw two bright objects in sky, called me at home in Peachtree City.  I only saw one, trees may have obscured second.  Tried to find with home telescope, unsuccessful.  Object dimmed quite noticeably as sun set.  Object stayed in same position, then was gone after sun set.;33.3962218390804;-84.5694908045978
