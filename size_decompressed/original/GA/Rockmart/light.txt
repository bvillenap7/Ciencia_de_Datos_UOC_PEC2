Bright light seen with strange motion.;2019-06-02 23:15:00;5 minutes;Bright light seen with strange motion. Bright light going in a circular motion then would leap out a short distance from where I first saw it, continue in a circular motion, leap back in the opposite direction and continue the circular motion.  Strange propulsion.  It was light orange in color.  The sky was mostly clear with very thin, scattered clouds.  An airplane was spotted in the vicinity of the object on a known flight path.  The duration of the sighting was approximately 5 minutes.  I ran in the house to grab my phone to record it, rushed back outside and object was gone.  I had a strange feeling while watching the object.  My heart began racing.  I watched the object from my front yard while out walking my dog.;33.9941;-85.061
