A couple people and i were driving up the highway from Cedartown, Ga to Rockmart, Ga and  I noticed a very, very bright, big star at the left of us, but it was very far away. I kept studying it, and studying it and as we kept driving the light would shine through the trees. The person in the backseat said that it was a star but i was thinking that it was too bright to be a star. So my eyes never left the object in the sky.  As we got closer to my house we got closer to the object.  I then noticed that a little red light was flashing on the right side of it.   Then i started to look under it to see if it was a telephone tower but nothing was under it. I could see like sometime dark under the light that it was giving off and i kept saying &quotit looks like its hovering, it looks like its hovering&quot and then i pulled in my drive way and noticed police blue lights behind my house and then i stopped looking at the object. It kind of scared me because i followed! it with my eyes for a good 2-3 miles and it stayed in the same spot it looked like.  However the sky was clear that night. It was hovering right over a red light and a neighborhood.  One i got close enough to it to see, it looked like it might of been moving very slowly, but like i said almost hovering.  However there was what looked like an airplane a lot higher above it.;33.9941;-85.061
