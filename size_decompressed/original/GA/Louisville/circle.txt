At this time it appeared directly ahead at a distance that what not discernable.  After 2 minutes, the light re-appeared, coming on, almost appearing to float downwards a small amount.  It then dissapeared and reappeared a bit further left, once again falling before reappearing closer to the clouds above it.  Since it was now closer, it was evident the object was only around 500 ft in the sky.  Having stopped the car on the side of the road, we were able to hear a faint noise sounding somewhat similar to a helicopter.  Checking local flight radars, I saw no flights in the area, and with the distance to it being less than a thousand feet, a helicopter would not have been as quiet.  The lights seemed far too bright to be a drone.;33.0194;-82.3885
