I did not have to turn on my halogen head lights.  I looked into the sky at what I first assumed to be an aircraft flying over.  However, I notice that this craft(s) lights were not the normal pattern of an aircraft.  These very, very, intense halogen appearings would almost burn out one by one, still appearing to move in the air.  Once they would burn out.  I couldn't see any solid shape and I heard no noise.  After all the lights disppeared, I continue to search the skyline and after another minute I just saw one light again and it slowly burned out again.  I reported a similar incident in this county approximately 1 year ago about 12-15 miles outside of this city.;32.9762;-82.8422
