I would like to know what I saw.;2010-12-06 08:00:00;2 min;I would like to know what I saw. I observed a bright metallic object that I first thought was an airplane moving Southeast at an apparent high rate of speed.  I was Deer Hunting and had seen hundreds of Air Planes fly over over the past 27 years at this property.   The object appeared to be at a high altitude such a a commercial aircraft.  The object was cigar shaped and  had no wings and there was no vapor trail coming from the craft.  There was no noise.   I am 63 years old and served in US Airforce and I have never witness anything like this.;32.9762;-82.8422
