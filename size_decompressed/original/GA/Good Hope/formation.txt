My friend lived in the middle of nowhere, a farming community-type situation, so there was a beautiful clear view of the night sky. I don't remember who noticed the lights first, but I remember just being confused by them. There were 5 or 6 golden/white orbs way out in the distance they weren't in any particular formation shape, but I could best describe it as an almost staggered, round formation. They hovered in that spot for quite some time while slowly shifting around in the formation.  I also remember it being hushed like all the bugs and frogs had ceased their chirping. I don't remember much else because the sight was so relaxing that I eventually just fell asleep, and I believe my friend did as well. I'm trying to find my friends' information to ask what they remember. We did ask their mom about it the following day, an! d the mom dismissed it (we were 10, so I get it).;33.7613;-83.595
