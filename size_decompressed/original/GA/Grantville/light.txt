Mysterious Lights that seemed to have landed and taken off again;2005-09-25 23:18:00;3 minutes;Mysterious Lights that seemed to have landed and taken off again I was lying in bed watching the 11:00 clock news, when I saw some bright white flashing out of my double window which faces the south. At first I thought it was the tv glaring off the window because it isn't covered with drapery or blinds, I watched for about 10 seconds, then I got up and went to the window. It was very cloudy and dark so I could not see an object, just the lights. It appeared to be 3 or 4 bright large white lights that were flashin with a small red one. Since I had on no clothes I went to my closet which is next to the window grabbed my robe and went on the back porch which is only about 15 feet from my window(faces the southern sky). I turned on the poch light and saw that the wind had began to blow and at the same time the lights faded as if the object was lowering. I didn't see anything else so Iwent back to bed. I was so startled by what I had seen I kept an eye out the window. At 11:21 pm I saw the same lights in the same spot as if they were rising. I ran to window so fast that it woke my husband and he came to the window also, although still half asleep he saw them also. They stayed very low near the tree tops for about 20 more seconds then ascended to far up for me to see. By this time I was too scared to look from outside on the porch, so I cannot tell which direction they went. I know that this was not a plane because it was too low and stayed in the same position for too long, it was too close to have been a helicopter or I would have heard it.;33.2473;-84.835
