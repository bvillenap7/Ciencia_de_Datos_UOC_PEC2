2 Large triangle shape flying objects directly over my house.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-10 22:30:00;10 seconds;2 Large triangle shape flying objects directly over my house that were loud upon approach but quiet underneath and behind flying slow. I was sitting in my house folding clothes and heard a loud noise and I thought something was about to crash in my back yard.  A plane, a rocket or an asteroid.  I was scared it was that loud and close.  Then I heard it pass by the back of my house so I walked out in the yard and looked up and there were 2 triangle shapes so low to the ground I thought I could throw a baseball and hit them.  They had a yellow light on either end and a red light in the middle of the back.  I expected it to be so loud because of what I heard coming towards me.  But looking up under it there was barely any sound.  It was also traveling slower than anything I have seen that large travel in the sky.  I started searching this morning online and come across this site and had to report it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
