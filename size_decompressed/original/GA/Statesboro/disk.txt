saucer shaped craft hovering above tree tops,multiple witnesses.;2009-12-28 06:00:00;5 minutes;saucer shaped craft hovering above tree tops,multiple witnesses. It was early dawn,as we had already seen strange objects prior to this one earlier that night me and my brother were looking out the window when I spotted a saucer shaped object hovering over some pines due east or at our 11,I asked my brother  what the hell is that?,he looked in the direction I was pointing and got a visual on the object,his girlfriend was also present and I called to her to come look,at this point we were all hanging out the window in disbelief.I would like to mention we were on the second floor of a two story house that sits on a slight hill with a good view of the low lying land. The distance of the object I would guess was roughly a thousand feet from our location and hovering about fifty to seventy five feet off the ground and just off the tree tops.It wobbled slightly and moved slowly from side to side.It had blinking lights on its side and at least one on top.It was a metallic grey in color.We continued to watch the object for about five minutes before it slowly moved out of sight.There was also no sound.The object was roughly seventy five to a hundred feet across.
