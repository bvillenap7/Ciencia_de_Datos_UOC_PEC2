In 1978 I saw six star-like objects sit stationary in the sky and then take off at an extremely high rate of speed;1978-08-15 20:30:00;7 minutes;In 1978 I saw six star-like objects sit stationary in the sky and then take off at an extremely high rate of speed I have never officially reported this until now...I was 17 at the time this happened and I am now 43.  I will never forget it...It has been one of the most profound events of my life, and I think about it every so often....I was out running sprints up and down the street practicing for a high school track meet... The night was calm and clear...I ran about 150 yards or so and when finished put my hands on my hips and looked upward while gasping for breath...I immediately saw six star-like objects that appeared to be at an altitude that a small cub plane might fly at or even less...I was immediately transfixed and just stared at them for about two minutes...A car came by and I ran over to it to ask them to come and be a witness to this but they thought I was some kind of nut and just kept going...I ran back over just 30 yards or so back to where I was and stared at them some more...I knew in my heart and mind that this was something unique, and I began to feel as though I was having a religious experience-- I remember saying to them,  Take me, but please bring me back...  Then all of a sudden, two of them left the irregular grouping and slowly traveled upward a little ways above the other four, and then they just stopped and stayed...I watched them even more intently then for just about 30 seconds or so, and then ( I will never forget this ) all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, these six star-like objects went from being totally stationary to taking off and getting in a single file formation while at a speed that was just totally unearthly...The only thing I can even compare it to is like watching fireflys fly...There was no noise, no sound, no flashing lights, no sonic boom, just simply an unreal experience...I estimate that they traveled 25 miles in less than 5 or 7 seconds...I have no way of knowing that, it is just a guess...I saw them travel in a southerly direction following Highway 301 South in the direction of a town that I knew to be 22 miles from where I was...It appeared t! hat they had traveled that far in that short amount of time as I watched them travel for as far as I could see with my naked eye on a clear night....They were like miniature stars, very bright white, but with no color or lights...They were silent and could move slow or EXTREMELY fast-- I know enough about physics to know that if there was a human being inside one of those objects, his body would have exploded like jello due to the G-forces ...But human beings in association with this event have never entered my thoughts-- I knew then as I know now and will always know, that these were not of this world...;32.4449139240506;-81.7624164556961
Silent green light traveling at an unbelievable speed.;2001-11-17 22:00:00;approx. 20-25 sec;Silent green light traveling at an unbelievable speed. At approximately 2200 hrs., Myself and two other's were outside to see if the reported meteor shower had begun. While looking off into the southern horizon, I noticed a green light. The light first started as a white light and slowly changed to a light green color. There were no Flashing lights or red lights, as associated with aircraft. Also the light stayed on a straight path, and was seen for miles. The light also was moving at a speed which seemed out of the norm for local aircraft i.e. jet fighters. There was no sound with the object which made me think it might have been an early meteor, but as the object continued into the distance, I noticed there was no dust trail as seen with meteor's. Also the object did not appear to be Burning or a Fireball. The light continued into the distance until it became to small to see.;32.4449139240506;-81.7624164556961
Amber lights appearing in a line, then fading as a new one appeared.;2006-11-28 23:30:00;30 minutes;Amber lights appearing in a line, then fading as a new one appeared. We were driving home on Old Riggs Mill Road when I saw a line of lights across the sky. They were amber, not green. One appeared, then as the next one appeared right beside it, the first one burned out, until four lights in a line appeared and burned out. Not disappeared appeared to fade. The phenomenon happened again just a short distance away. All three of us saw it. As we continued to drive, we saw similar occurrences at different spots in the sky - just not always four lights once it was two, once it was three. I am a news reporter. I posted a blog on our web site (www.statesboroherald.net) and several people responded, claiming to have seen the same thing.  One woman from Screven County called me to report a similar, but more detailed, sighting where the lights appeared in a V-formation and seemed to be performing a show.  There were no trails and the lights did not fall - they were NOT meteors or flares.;32.4449139240506;-81.7624164556961
A bright white light moving at supersonic speed in northern sky of southeastern U.S.;2007-04-21 22:00:00;5 seconds;A bright white light moving at supersonic speed in northern sky of southeastern U.S. I left my brothers residence shortly before 2200 hours.  As I was walking to door he stated he had to go outside to turn off sprinkler.  I then departed to return home as I drove into my yard I observed unknown in northern sky and appeared to be app. 5 miles away at app. 5000 ft. altitude moving at supersonic speed (700/1000 mph) with no noise of any kind, it very rapidly was obscured by tree line on my property.  My brother also lives on this same mutual farm property and we are seperated by this same tree line and about 300 meters distant.  I knew my brother had just went outside to turn off irrigation I immediatly called him to see if he had also observed.  My brother had also observed and reported that craft had also disappeared beyond tree line.  I have a background in sport aviation and I consider myself to be knowledgeable of aircraft types and am not fooled by things such as landing lights or military aircraft and I have observed many meteors and manmade debris entering atmosphere and this had a markedly different appearance in the very few seconds I observed.  The object was bright white illumination(not burning) w/flat trajectory and no debris was falling off as in space junk   I have previously seen(if norad releases any statement on this please contact me with info);32.4449139240506;-81.7624164556961
