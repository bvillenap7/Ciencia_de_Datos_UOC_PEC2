Large formation of red lights with lead light being white.;2014-12-03 20:55:00;5 minutes;Large formation of red lights with lead light being white. Saw 4/5 red lights and one white/yellowish light in front flying in formation (guess it could have been just one ship but huge)over pine mountain between Thomsaton and Meansville Georgia.  They did not change shape and kept in one direction. heading northwest from Thomaston.  I though it was one ship, my wife thought it may have been more than one flying in formation.  If it was one ship it was a mile long at least.  It was far from us however we had a good view.  I wish I could have gotten video of it, but feared it would have been gone by the time I went into the house to get camera.;33.016;-84.3181
