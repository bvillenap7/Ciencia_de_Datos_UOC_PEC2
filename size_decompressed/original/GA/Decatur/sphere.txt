Small silver sphere motionless in blue sky.;2007-04-30 19:00:00;15-20 minutes;Small silver sphere motionless in blue sky. UFO sighting 4/30/07 7:00PM EDT  I was lying in my hammock in the back yard taking a brief rest. The sky was bright blue with no clouds. Directly in my line of vision was a silver ball motionless in the sky. It was either very small or very high. I figured that it was either a planet somehow visible during the day or a satellite. My main concern was in trying to identify the object, so I went into my house and got my binoculars and digital camera. I got back into the hammock and attempted to look at the object through the binoculars. Because of the hammock’s movement and my arms moving I couldn’t keep the object steady in the binoculars. The image was moving back and forth so fast that I couldn’t really tell much about it except that in the binoculars it looked more cylindrical with some sort of darker areas at the ends. Getting more frustrated at not being able to see the object better, I got down on the ground and tried again to get it in the binoculars. About this time I noticed that without the binoculars I couldn’t see it at all. I grabbed my camera, a Canon A610, and ran the lens out to maximum zoom including the 4X digital zoom. I took a series of 12 pictures of the area where the object had been. One of the pictures has a bright white spot that I’m sure is the object. Another picture has a small black dot that may or may not have anything to do with the object. The whole period of time that I was able to see the object was approximately 15 to 20 minutes. It never moved during that time except to fade from view at the end.;33.7534755555555;-84.2726235555553
Bright moon like shape seem hovering in the clearing in trees behind my home that would fade and reappear.;2020-04-06 04:00:00;30 minutes;Bright moon like shape seem hovering in the clearing in trees behind my home that would fade and reappear. I noticed a bright white light through my blinds where the trees are thick behind my home. It was above the large cleared area in the trees. It is typically very dark there. I looked through my blinds and saw a light through the trees. It was an almost sphere like shape at times shining very bright and seemed to be hovering in one spot, but movement was noticeable as it hovered. I could hear a low humming sound. At times the light would appear to have a beam and other times it would fade and dissapear. When the light reappeared it would become very bright. It looked similar to a near full moon hovering lower than the tree tops, but it was not the moon.;33.7534755555555;-84.2726235555553
