Approx 2 years ago, I was driving home in Decatur, GA. I saw what I thought was a helicopter hovering about 25-35 feet above the road.  I slowed down as it had a bright light shining. I thought it was a police helicopter searching for a suspect and given the proximity to the ground, I thought they had him cornered.  It was so close it looked as if it were going to land, so I slowed more.  Not hearing any noise, I opened my window and noted that there was still no helicopter sound nor the strong gust of wind from the blades and there were no police cars around or sirens.  Realizing that it was not a helicopter, I quickly sped up as I passed underneath while looking back (sideview and rearview mirrors) I traveled about 40 yards, and it was gone.  I then drove down and made a u-turn and looked back, nothing. I sped home, about 1/4 mile away and scanned the area, and nothing was there.  I got my son's telescope from inside (about 30 seconds to get) and came out and surveyed the area especially in the direction of the police station where the copter is kept. No helicopter, no lights, nothing.  ITS APPEARANCE: Since I was looking for it to be a helicopter, my description will not be that good.  I noted it was large but cannot give dimensions but I could appreciate that it was blocking out more sky than it was supposed to be.  It easily spanned 2 lanes and had height.  I recall a bright light and seem to recall three, but at the time, I thought it was the police with a searchlight so I focused on 1 light and where it was shining.  I only became suspicious after noting that neither it nor my surroundings were behaving consistent with a closely hovering helicopter and it was too big.  No trees were blowing either. visibility was clear.  No clouds.  It was behaving as if someone was steering it.  Were that not the case, it would have struck the tall trees or poles near it.  Unusual movement:  Its movements were smooth and it moved side to side slightly.  BTW I drive that way daily and looked for anything else that c! ould explain it.  I stand by my conclusion.  That's it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.7534755555555;-84.2726235555553
