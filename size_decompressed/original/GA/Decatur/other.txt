Strange, small star-like lights moving in erratic patterns alternating in speeds.;2007-09-14 21:00:00;2 hours;Strange, small star-like lights moving in erratic patterns alternating in speeds. On the nights of September 14th and 15th and 16th (tonight), 2007 I have noticed strange lights in the sky over the city of Atlanta.  I am not sure whether they were ufo’s or not, but I can’t think of any other explanation for what they might be.  There were 5-6 of the objects.  They were small and resembled very dim stars so I believe they were very high in the sky.  They fluctuated  intensity in their brightness as they moved in very erratic patterns.  They would seem to drift for a moment or two, then all of the sudden they would fade and take off in a totally different direction at many times an accelerated speed and then slow down again.  They were not moving in unison.  This activity went on for hours until I had to go to bed.  This is not the first occasion  that I have witnessed this same phenomenon.  The first time was in 2005, For several weeks following Hurricane Katrina.  On these occasions my roommate at the time witnessed them with me.  This year, however, she was not with me and this is the first time I have seen them since. I would like to submit a photo, but unfortunately I do not have a good camera so the objects were too small/far away to capture.  I don’t know if anyone else has reported these or not, but I would like to know whether what I saw were in fact ufo’s or not.;33.7534755555555;-84.2726235555553
