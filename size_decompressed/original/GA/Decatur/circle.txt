Gray stationary object seen over Tucker area.;2012-10-22 07:11:00;1 minute;Gray stationary object seen over Tucker area. I saw a dark circular object in the sky over the Tucker, Georgia area as I was waiting to turn onto I-285 in the morning on my way to work (at exactly 7:11 am, still dark out).  I was at the traffic light facing north and noticed the object which appeared to be a great enough distance above the tree line to make me wonder what exactly it was as it did not appear to be a tower, billboard, planet, etc.?  The object was stationary and almost looked like the silhouette of a really tiny planet but obviously within a few miles of my position and not in outer space, at least as far as I could tell. I snapped a couple photo’s with my iphone before the light changed with the thought that I’d relook at the area at another time when it was lighter out and compare my photographs.  I retook the photo this morning (10-23-12) when the sun had started coming up (7:23 am).  I definitely could not see anything in my second photo that could have been the object in my first photo (btw, I am going to try and attach the photos to this word document). In true “UFO Photo” fashion, the picture is grainy and the object looks far off.  For all I know this was some planet or something else obvious.  Either way, I found it interesting and wanted to share. Did anyone else in the Tucker/Decatur area see this thing?  The object I am referring to is the small dark gray circular object in between the two green lights just above where I put an arrow.  The other spots are just reflections on my windshield and stars.  And no, this was not a spot on my window.  I bothered to stick my head outside my window just to double check. Next day photo.  I didn’t see anything that could have been the dark circular object.;33.7534755555555;-84.2726235555553

The light was getting bigger and bigger when we realized we were getting closer to this object which it wasn't moving.  We were still thinking that could be a helicopter but when we were under this object we started to scream because it was something oval and huge.  I was trying to find a place to park the car and when I finally could this object flew away.  When we looked it was in a diagonal position and than it was gone.  We still run to try to follow it but there were so many airplanes on the sky that we couldn't recorganize the object anymore.;33.7534755555555;-84.2726235555553
