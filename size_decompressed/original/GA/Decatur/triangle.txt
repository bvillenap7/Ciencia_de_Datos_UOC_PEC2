WE (MY SISTER) WERE ON GLENWOOD AND COLUMBIA DRIVE WHEN WE SAW THIS TRIANGULAR SHAPE IN THE SKY MOVING SORT OF SLOW ACROSS THE SKY WHICH WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO SHOOT A BB GUN AND HIT IT.  WE THOUGHT WE WERE IMAGINING SOMETHING WHICH WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE WE BOTH WERE DESCRIBING THE SAME THING.  WE DROVE TO MY MOMS HOUSE WHERE WE BOTH LIVED AT THE TIME (SOUTH COLUMBIA PLACE BETWEEN MACAFEE AND GLENWOOD).  WE GOT OUT OF THE CAR WENT IN TO GO ON THE BACK PORCH TO SEE WHAT WE COULD SEE, THE THING JUST HOOVERED OVER THE HOUSE AT A CLOSE RANGE.  CLEARLY WE COULD SEE THAT IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE.  IT START MOVING AWAY.  WE BOTH GOT IN THE CAR AN DECIDED TO FOLLOW THEM.  WE WENT SOUTH ON S COLUMBIA DRIVE TO MACAFEE HEADING TOWARDS COLUMBIA DRIVE TOWARDS SNAPFINGER RD AND IT STARTED MOVING OUT OF SIGHT.  WE WERE FLABERGASTIC, IN AWE WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO, WHAT TO SAY OR WHO TO REPORT IT TO.  PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE MAKING THE WHOLE THING UP.

Triangle of lights, spinning counterclockwise, in sync. hovering. no sound. center lit up.;2014-01-31 20:00:00;5 minutes;triangle of lights, spinning counterclockwise, in sync. hovering. no sound. center lit up. I was walking down the street, at night, wearing noise canceling headphones. From the corner of my eye, I saw what looked like multiple airplanes in the sky.  I then looked towards them and saw three lights in the shape of a triangle, spinning counterclockwise. I took out my headphones expecting to hear a noise like airplanes or something but heard nothing.  I couldn't make out whether or not it was one object or three separate objects but, they were all in sync, hovering.  There were no cars on the road.  I was the only person in sight. So, instinctively, I ran back home as fast as I possibly could.  I looked back a second time before i made it down the stairs to my complex to see if i was really seeing this and I saw the middle of the object start to light up as if it were getting ready to move.  It looked like something in a movie.  I told my mom what i had saw and she told me to stay inside.  I wanted to go back outside to see if it was still there but, she said not to.;33.7534755555555;-84.2726235555553
