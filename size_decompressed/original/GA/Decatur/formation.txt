12 orange balls of light fly over Atlanta.;2013-02-09 00:00:00;5 minutes;12 orange balls of light fly over Atlanta. On February 8th going into the 9th, sometime around midnight, I witnessed 12 orange lights in a string formation moving SW coming from the NE of Atlanta in the night sky.  They were headed toward ATL Int'l airport right into the flight pattern, but lower than the usual airliner, and so I thought they were probably a group of military C-130s.  Problem is, they made absolutely NO sound and traveled at an estimated speed of 400-500mph.   I am a former Air Force aircraft mechanic and aviation enthusiast, and know all forms of man made aircraft very well.  Either what I saw was classified military aircraft, or something otherworldly.  And so far my attempts to contact anyone at ATL's ATC for information, has failed.  They keep giving me more phone numbers to call.   I only checked NUFORC's site because after I told my brother about the event, he recommended I take a look at the similar reports.  I was shocked to find so many, and am now convinced I saw something unidentified.;33.7534755555555;-84.2726235555553
