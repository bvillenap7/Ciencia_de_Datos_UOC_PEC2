Multiple red circles still, but also moving;2020-10-25 20:00:00;20;Multiple red circles still, but also moving I saw a bright red circle in the sky. It caught my eye because of how bright it was and I thought it was a planet.  But then I realized there seemed to be 5 or 6 of them.  All still, not moving, not making noise.  Periodically they would move to a different location, but then were still.  I watched for about 20 minutes until the clouds covered them.  It also looked like periodically fire would drop out of the bottom then evaporate in the sky.;33.7534755555555;-84.2726235555553
