Anyone else see this?;2011-04-13 18:30:00;10-25 seconds;Anyone else see this? Was in the drive thru at Mcdonalds yesterday, I looked up at the sky and saw a round object, that I thought was mars just looking like it was slightly larger/brighter than normal or just a bright star, no sooner did I think to myself wow that's pretty neat, it took off in a visible blur and went straight up.
