As we were leaving I looked toward the Flint River.  In the sky were 8 red dots in the formation of the Big Dipper but upside down. The lights were slightly blinking.   As I watched all but one of the lights started moving, all in different directions.  As the lights moved one by one they disappeared.  The last sight of it I had there were three dots left, two moving and one stationary.;31.5616019512195;-84.1904170731707
