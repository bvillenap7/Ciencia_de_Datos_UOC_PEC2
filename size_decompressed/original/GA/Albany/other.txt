Oblong shaped object with light on bottom and completely silent.;2008-02-28 03:40:00;10 minutes;Oblong shaped object with light on bottom and completely silent. O.k. heres my siting info.  At 3:40 Am I was driving on Philema Rd in Dougherty Co GA when I noticed a weird looking light just over a tree line in the distance. Probably about 1/4 mile away. I thought it might have been a helecopter flying low.  I drove closer to the light and it started to travel parallel along the tree line.  I followed it at about 50 mph.  It stayed just ahead of me but I could make out an oblong type object.  After about 2 miles it stopped  over a residential neighborhood and hovered in an open area without too many trees.  I pulled into a gas station and got a good look at it.  I got a spotlight out of my car and shined the light on the object.  The light barely hit it but I could really see it good.  It was an oblong type shaped object.   It was a clear cold night without any clouds.  As the light hit it, the object turned towards my location and flew at a very high rate of speed.   I rode the area for the next 30 minutes or so but never saw it again.  Also the light was on the bottom of the object shining down like it was looking for something.  The object was completely silent without any noise at all coming from  it.;31.5616019512195;-84.1904170731707
I could only see it in the flash of the lightening.;2011-12-25 04:54:00;2 seconds;I could only see it in the flash of the lightening. Coming home from a visit to Moutrie, GA., my daughter, neice and I were traveling east toward Albany just before reaching the Sale City highway. It was still day and in the distance a cloud was approaching.  Where we were it was clear.  In the distance about six miles away the lightening flashed.  At that moment I could see what had obviousy there all the time.  To the left of the car a huge space ship hovered over the trees.  I could only see it for the duration of the light from the lightening.  I wondered if I really saw it and shook my head.  At that time my neice yelled OMG!  I kept driving.  Some of the ship purtruded into the road.  It was a metalic with lights in front and stories as a high rise would have.  It was not moving.;31.5616019512195;-84.1904170731707
