I saw one tubular, white object in the sky.  It was too high to be an object on the ground.  I saw it driving east around 4:30pm.  It was above the treeline.  It wasn't moving.  When I turned the corner going south, I then turned into my driveway facing east again.  I got out to snap a picture, but it was gone.  From the moment I saw it to the moment I lost sight of it, it was only around 30 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
