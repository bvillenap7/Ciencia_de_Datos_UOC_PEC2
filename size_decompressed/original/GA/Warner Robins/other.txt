Rose-colored blob w/ lights.;2006-07-06 03:30:00;1 minute;Rose-colored blob w/ lights. Travelling north on GA Hwy 129, a bright, rose-colored blob caught my attention, as it changed shape in the sky to the east.  It was about 1000 ft in the air, and at first seemed like a capsule shape.   It then had several spheres that bulged out of it, but never entirely separated themselves from the rest of the object.  This thing was huge.  If a C-130 flew by it, this thing would be about 10 times as large.   Like I said, it started ot as a capsule shape, and then appeared to become a blob, as all the spheres were coming from it.   At the time I was about 4-5 miles south of Robins Air Force Base.  I pulled over and stopped to watch it.  And with my passenger window rolled down I could see it.  As soon as I came to a complete stop, it vanished, (or at least it turned off its lights).;32.6026804878049;-83.6409593495934
