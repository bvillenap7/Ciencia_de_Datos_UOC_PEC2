The;2006-09-20 21:28:00;3 seconds;I was driving home from CDL class at the Technical College.  My friend was also driving next to me.  We were on a four lane road.  The Robins Air Force Base is very near by so when I first saw the light I thought that it was perhaps a small light from a jet, yet, it was moving way too fast for even a jet.  The light moved from right to left in the sky and then just took off.  At first I thought only I had seen the object but then my friend rolled down her window and said, Did you see that?  We could not believe it.;32.6026804878049;-83.6409593495934

Orange reddish object and white lights observed for 45 minutes.;2016-09-27 22:00:00;45 minutes;Orange reddish object and white lights observed for 45 minutes. About 10 p.m. on the night of Sept 27, 2016, I was in my back yard smoking a cigar and watching the sky when I noticed an orange reddish light to my West to a little Northwest streaking down from high in the sky to down low in the horizon.  The object began to move back and forth in a way that was not conventional away from me until I could no longer see it.   Then another identical light streaked down and did the same thing as the first light and after I could no longer see that one a third one streaked down and did the same as the first two, each time this happened it took maybe 10 seconds each at most from streaking down, dancing and disappearing.  Then I saw nothing for about 10 seconds and I threw down my cigar and rushed into my house to get my phone to see if I could get any video of this.   I ran back outside into my back yard and waited about 1 minute and the light returned but this time suddenly appearing motionless like a star in the horizon and then moving down low like before but instead of moving into the distance away from me the light danced up and down and back and forth sometimes appearing in two places at the same time. I tried to shoot video but I can see nothing on it but lights from a manufacturing plant across the street and some traffic.   After about 15 minutes I then noticed to my Southwest a group of 3 white lights appear and streak across a small portion of sky and immediately followed by small groups of white lights moving streaking sideways across the same small portion of sky sometimes as many as 5 at a time in some weird formation.  I thought theses lights were a long way from me maybe around 10 miles out but then one moved between me and a telephone pole that was only 30 feet away from me.  I thought at first that my eyes were playing a trick on me so I moved away from the pole and only one of the white lights to my Southwest moved and for about 15 seconds stayed between me and the pole.  This scared me sli! ghtly so I moved completely across my back yard to put some distance between me and the light which and I tried to get my neighbor up to have a second witness but she was in bed.  In the meantime the orange reddish object is still doing the same thing as before but now there is one white light with it and they dance up and down and back and forth sometimes appearing as 4 or 5 objects at one time and then quickly back to two one on the left was white the one on the right was orange reddish.  If all that was not strange enough for a few minutes these lights mimicked my movements both up and down and back and forth, this further scared me but I am a muscular masculine man who will not scare easy but that was weird.  I am 51 years old and have been a sky watcher since I was a child and I have witnessed some things that were hard to explain but with proper homework I have explained every weird thing I have ever seen in the sky until last night.  I tried to convince myself of drones, birds, bugs, laser pointer and even cobwebs but this was none of these things.;32.6026804878049;-83.6409593495934
Light in sky increases in brightness and then disappears;2016-11-25 01:30:00;15 minutes;Light in sky increases in brightness and then disappears My boyfriend and I were sitting on the back porch just hanging out. I looked up into the sky to star gaze, when I noticed what I thought was a star increase in brightness and disappear. I said to my boyfriend What was that?, he did not seem to interested and I went back to looking up at the sky but this time at the location that the light occurred. Then just a short distance from the original location another light grew in brightness but not as bright as the first, then immediately disappeared. I again said What was that? It did it again!, this time he looked up and said I do not see anything, then he went back to his phone. I looked back and at that time I saw a light shoot across the sky just below both locations of the original lights. I said There goes a shooting star!, but I am not sure that it was and could be related to the first two lights. The initial light was blended into its surroundings by looking ! like a star. When it grew in brightness there was an outside ring of white light with a center white light of a solid circular shape. The second increase of light was of the same make-up but dimmer than the first. The shooting start was a solid white light shooting across the sky from right to left. The night sky was clear with no clouds in the sky and no obstructions visible from my backyard to the sky.;32.6026804878049;-83.6409593495934
Two lights following in the same SW trajectory.;2018-07-04 21:00:00;15 minutes;Two lights following in the same SW trajectory My wife and I were standing in our driveway in western Warner Robins, watching Fourth of July fireworks all around us, both from our neighorhood and from large fireworks displays further away.  There were some large fireworks off to the NE that we could see, at which point we spotted a light flying in our general direction.  At first we thought it was an ember from the fireworks, as it was the same color as a flame, but embers usually burn out relatively quickly.  We concluded it must not be when it kept on going and didn't lose its luminosity. It didn't make a sound as it flew over our neighborhood in a straight line towards the SW at a speed of approximately 15-20 mph and an altitude of approximately 3/4-1 mile.  We watched it as it flew off into the distance until we could not see it anymore.   A few minutes passed, and another object, exactly the same as the first in every way (same altitude and speed) came from the same location and followed the same trajectory.  This time, my wife was able to find my spyglass and I got a closer look at it.   It was very dark outside by this point so I could really only make out the light, but there was just enough sunlight where I thought I could make out a dark shape around the moving light, like there was more to the object than just the light.   I am not 100% sure about this as it was pretty far away and very dark by the time I got the spyglass.;32.6026804878049;-83.6409593495934
