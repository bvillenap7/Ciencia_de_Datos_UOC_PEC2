When I turned the object disappeared. I saw the object while riding on Elberta rd in Warner Robin, Ga. The object was about 300 feet above the tree line. I was a triangled shape and had three yellow lights in each angle. It was moving at a great speed and it looked as it was moving parallel with our car. When the car turned to go south on Houston rd. the object just disappeared into the night sky without a trace. The object was about 9 and 1/2 feet on each angle. After I saw the object I was stunned and surprised. I did not tell anyone else in the car what I saw becuase i did not want to be ridiculed and taunted becauseI was young at the time. I believe what I saw was of un-earthly orgin because I have never seen anything like that before. I am also not the type of person to lie or make things up. I am a strait A student and am at the top of my class too. People always can trust me. I know what I saw and it is not made up!;32.6026804878049;-83.6409593495934
There ARE UFOs over Robins AFB, Ga.;2001-11-27 19:30:00;10 1/2 hours;There ARE UFOs over Robins AFB, Ga. There were 6 things in the sky. At first, we thought they were airplanes over the AFB, but they were stationary and didn't have the usual lights one sees on planes at night.  When we looked at them through my daughter's binoculars, we could see them better.  They were triangular-shaped, but without the bottom of a triangle - they were like upside-down V's.  There were two larger ones and three smaller ones.  They were just hovering over Robins AFB all night long.  I kept getting up to check to see if they were still there and they were. Around 1:30 am one of the big ones just left - it was there and then it wasn't & when I got up to look again around 3:30 am, there were only two small ones left. Finally at 6:22 am 11/29/01, there was only one left.  This is not the first time that I have seen strange things over the base, but it was the first time that I ever had a chance to see them with more than my naked eyes.  These things are sometimes long and oval-ish with orange lights on the underside, and I have seen some weird looking round ones, too.  They never show up in the late spring-early summer either.  They always start coming in late November and you can see them 2-3 times a week until as late as the last week of February/first days of March. ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from the Air Force base for this date.  The fact that the objects have been seen repeatedly, and for up to 10.5 hours (as indicated in this report), suggests to us that they may be celestial bodies, but that is only a guess.
