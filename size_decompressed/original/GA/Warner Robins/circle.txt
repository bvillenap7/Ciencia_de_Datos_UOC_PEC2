I have never seen anything like this before;2001-05-16 22:14:00;2 minutes;I have never seen anything like this before I was in my back yard in northern Houston county near the Bibb county line.  I was stargazing and I saw an object that caught my eye because it was not a planet nor a star.  It seemed too bright to be any of these and I doubt that it was a supernova.  I was watching it for about a minute--it seemed to be a bit wobbly when finally after 45 seconds after I watched it, it then burst in to two smaller objects of the same size.  They did proceeded to move in a strait line from where the initial object was.  They were moving very slowly and they were both travelling in opposide directions-- one going southwest, the other going northeast... watched the object for another minute or so and then watch it go over the tree line.;32.6026804878049;-83.6409593495934
