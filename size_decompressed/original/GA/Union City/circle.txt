I look to my west and see a extremely bright white light circle shape.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2020-03-21 22:25:00;2 minutes;Cloudy and slight fog out.  I was on my back patio smoking a cigarette like I do every night when I look to my west and see a extremely bright white light circle shape.  I live near airport so lights in the sky are normal.  This light was different was extremely bright and didn’t move.  Was too high to be a helicopter and to low to be a star.  It did not move.  I called my son to come look at what I was seeing.  At this time the light wasn’t as bright but was still white and big.  When my son came out he was seeing it as well as we watched it for a minute it started to go in and out the light then turned red and disappeared.  Was weird to say the least.
