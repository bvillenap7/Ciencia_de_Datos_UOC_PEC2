UFO sighting on Nick-a-Jack Road on Lookout Mountain 9/29/13.;2013-09-29 21:00:00;Several seconds;UFO sighting on Nick-a-Jack Road on Lookout Mountain 9/29/13 My mom and I saw a UFO last night ( Sunday September 29, 2013) while driving up Lookout Mountain on Nick-a-Jack Road near Flintstone, GA. The object we saw had small red lights underneath with a larger, white light bean out front.  It appeared to be hovering above the road (about the height of a cell phone tower).   The shape looked to be a “v” or maybe a cross.   It was pitch dark out, so we could not see any other details.  It did not appear to be moving.   We slowed our car to look for several seconds.  We thought about turning around to try to video it, but we were a bit scared and continue on home.   The object was still there when as long as we could see.;34.9335;-85.3794
