Huge circle couldn't see the sky on either side.;2016-03-15 00:00:00;3 hours;Huge circle couldn't see the sky on either side. I was sitting out by the campfire in a field with some friends and noticed the moon wasn't out and was strangely dark.  I looked for stars, until I spotted a row of them at the edge of the tree line.  The more I looked I realized it was a perfectly curved line going in a circle around the mountain.  From where I was I could see the valley on either side of the mountain and the circle of lights took up what I'd guess was a 10 mile stretch.  They flashed an orange green color all in sync for about three hours.  We went to the house for food and heard a loud hum. when we came back out the moon and normally seen stars were out and the blinking lights where gone.  While it was In the sky my tv and radio went out.  I saw the same thing again last night, November 27th, 2016. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.9335;-85.3794
