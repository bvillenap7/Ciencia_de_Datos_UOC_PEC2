Slow moving white light UFO disappears.;2018-10-11 20:21:00;5 minutes;Slow moving white light UFO disappears. Me and my fianc√© were sitting on our porch looking out at the night sky and talking when between the trees I saw a light traveling from north to south and straight at us but at same time a slightly crurved path toward our home.  It was traveling slower than an air craft and it did not blink. It was a  pure singular white light.  We ran out into the yard to watch it as it flew over our home.  After it went over our home it continued to move upward into the sky and vanished in seconds.  It looked a star but brighter and bigger.;34.035;-83.2190999999999
