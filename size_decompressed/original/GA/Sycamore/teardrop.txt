We came upon our residence and to our south was one big bright light. As I scrambbled to see what it was, I saw the second light off to our southwest. They were about the same altitude and same size. We noticed the colors kept changing from whitish to orange, green, red and various colors in between. I got my telescope out and looked at it. It was then that I could see the shape and how the colors swirled from the inside of the object. The colors changed like that of our fiber optics. It was fascinating to see. The object made no sound and hovered in the same spot for 5 in. or so. The object to our south went red and got very small and appeared to drop straight down. Then it was gone. The second object that we had watched for so long did the same thing and then reappeared after a min. or so. It remained there for a few more min. and the slowly descended down behind the treeline across the field. About 10-15 min. later we were going to town and the first object had reappeared and was there for about 1 min. and turned red, shrank in size and was gone. I have never seen anything like this in my entire life! It was awsome! And on my birthday! If anyone else from the area saw this please respond!;31.6553;-83.6064
