Large Cigar-shaped UFO sighted near Atlanta.;1999-10-03 23:15:00;10 Seconds;Large Cigar-shaped UFO sighted near Atlanta. I never even thought to report this, as I thought it had been too long. I know what I saw and it was definately not a conventional aircraft by any means. Three of my close friends and I had been walking around my neighboorhood late in the evening. We had become tired as the loop in the neighboorhood was two and one-half miles, and we had circled it several times. We stopped by the neighboorhood poolhouse to get some soft drinks, and take a seat nearby on a picnic table. We were chit chatting, when I had noticed an object in the sky. I called it to their attention, and all of us were in awe. I honestly do not know how large it was, but I speculate it to be quite large, as it was definately higher than the treetops, making it at least 45 feet long in my estimation, more than likely larger. It was a full moon, so the craft had illumination upon it. It was a gunmetal colour, and had two bright lights on either end, and it was shaped like a fat cigar. More like a slug. It is hard to describe, but it was like a cigar that had been overstuffed. In the center of the craft was one light-emitting porthole. The craft moved incredibly fast, and no signs of propulsion were present. No thrust, no propellers, the craft was dead silent except for a rushing of air sound.
