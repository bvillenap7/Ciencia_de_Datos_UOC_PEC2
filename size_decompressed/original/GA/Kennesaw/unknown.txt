Single blinking red light, then green light, then disappeared completely.;2014-01-25 20:00:00;20 seconds;Single blinking red light, then green light, then disappeared completely. We saw what we thought was a helicopter with a single flashing red light go to the left over Jiles Road, then it immediately turned into a green light and went back to the right.   It traveled about a half a mile away and then disappeared into thin air.;34.020232330827;-84.621397744361
Three large white bright lights hovering less than 100 feet above the ground.;2014-11-17 23:00:00;<1 minute;Three large white bright lights hovering less than 100 feet above the ground. Around 11:00pm on Monday night, I was driving home talking to my wife on the cell phone. I was driving west on Chastain Rd. towards Canton Rd. Just after passing Chastain Meadows, I noticed 3 large, white lights in the sky, apx. 100 feet or less above the ground and probably just 20-30 feet above the trees the lights were above.  The lights were sitting above the trees above the homes that appear to have been built in the 60’s or 70’s on the west side of the Bell’s Ferry if you had turned right onto Bell’s Ferry from the direction I had been driving.   The lights appeared to be apx. 20 feet apart from each other and I noticed a much smaller red light between the left and center white lights.  The red light was also sitting lower than the large white lights.  The lights were not moving or flashing. I am very familiar with this intersection and knew that the lights were not coming from a permanent fixture but I could not figure out what it was or see any object or shape from what was creating the lights.   As I drove through the intersection on Chastain, I continued to look to my right and knew it was not normal and I was really seeing something strange. I pulled a u-turn at my first opportunity to go back and get a closer look.  When I got back to the intersection it was no longer at the spot I had seen - it was now over near the Suzuki office in the Chastain Meadows business park. I took a left onto Chastain Meadows and at the point it was gone - I could not see it anywhere. What initially got my attention was how low and bright the lights were and that they were not moving. Whatever the object was, it was hovering or sitting still for at least 30 seconds. There are several houses right there and I am really tempted to go door to door in that area and ask if anyone saw anything strange. It was just too obvious to ignore. I cannot forget what I saw and I am posting my experience here in hopes that someone else saw it too and will be motivated to say something after reading my experience. After this, I will be much more attentive and conscious of the sky. I cannot say what it was, perhaps it was some kind of military craft or something along those lines but I do remember the sensation and the confidence I had when I saw it - it was not normal and I had never seen anything like it.   I did a quick search and it seems like other people have seen similar things in this exact same area… Thanks;34.020232330827;-84.621397744361
Monotonous mid-tone pitch and sound for 15 min from no certain direction (loud). Neighborhoods heard it.;2019-10-09 22:50:00;10-15 minutes;Monotonous mid-tone pitch and sound for 15 min from no certain direction (loud). Neighborhoods heard it. All surrounding neighborhoods (based on chatting input online while it was happening) heard this monotonous sound that encompassed the sky from no certain direction. The pitch remained the same, and volume fluctuated very little (loud). middle tone for the entire time. After approx. 15 min, it stopped.  It was dark outside with just a few stars. Looking up, I couldn't see anything, but my full view was blocked by trees and I was uneasy, so I went back inside.;34.020232330827;-84.621397744361
