hovering lights;2003-10-01 18:00:00;dusk til dawn;hovering lights All of the following occurances have been taking place on a nightly basis since october of 2002. Besides myself, they have been witnessed by my wife, our eight year old boy, and my wife's non english speaking mother who was living with us at the time. I bring to point that my mother-in law does not speak english because that shows the level of communication that she and I have. When she first saw the lights in the sky, she led us out into the front yard and asked if we(my wife and I) were in some kind of trouble. The frequency at which they had appeared had became so upsetting to her that she assumed that it was some type of law enforcement watching over our subdivision. -My home is located about one mile northeast of Kennesaw mountain, and about five miles due north of Dobbins Air Force Base. a huge cell tower sits close to our house and a railroad train right next door along w/ a man made lake (that serves no purpose in our subdivision due to the lack of up keeping). -The bright white balls of light come up vertically from behind the tree line about a half mile south of my house in direct line of sight with Kennesaw mountain. They come up very slowly in groups of three and post positions equal distance from one another approximately 1500 ft off the ground. They then slowly move one after the other in a single line formation towards and then over my house. I know the height that they are from the ground because I have a cell phone tower IN MY BACKYARD which when they pass over they barely clear. These objects make NO SOUND when moving, and never move faster than approx. 30 knots (the landing speed of a piper cub). From below they look like a triangle shape similar to the stealth F-117 with three lights that would be at the respective nose and two wing landing gear formation. These craft come up in groups of three hover for approx. 5-10 minutes at their posted position then depart with a second group coming up in the same fashion. We have witnessed up to 12 craft in a one hour period on a nightly bases. It apprears that when all craft are airborne they then equally distribute themsevles throughout the marietta/atlanta city areas. This has been going on since october of 2002, maybe i'm just seeing things. ATTN: NUFORCE personel please contact me by email only as I am currently reloacting due to employment changes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate. It would be unusual, we believe, for bona fide UFO's to make nightly appearances in the same location.  We believe that lights associated with the nearby military base would be the first possibility to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witnesses were observing UFO's.
