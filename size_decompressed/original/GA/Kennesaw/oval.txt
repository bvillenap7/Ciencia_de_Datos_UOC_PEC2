Bright white light, stationary in the sky for at least 45 minutes, it was too low to be a plane, too high for a helicopter.;2018-11-16 06:00:00;45 minutes;Bright white light, stationary in the sky for at least 45 minutes, it was too low to be a plane, too high for a helicopter. I left my house to make the drive to Atlanta (26 miles) and in the sky I saw a very bright white light.  At first I assumed it was an airplane as we live near a small municipal airport, it was too low and  large to be a star.  As I got closer to the highway I realized the light wasnâ€™t moving.  I watched the light hang in the sky for my entire 45 minute drive south to Midtown Atlanta.  The light always staying on the left side of the highway.  At times the light was brighter, almost pointing in my direction and then it would be duller as if it turned from my line of sight.  When I got to my building and up on the 30th floor I walked all around to see if I could get a better look but by now the sun was coming up and it was nowhere to be found.  The shape was round in the center like this O very bright in the center and smaller lights on each side which initially made me believe it was an airplane.  But not moving for 45 minutes I believe it was something else.  Wish I could have captured a picture of it.;34.020232330827;-84.621397744361
