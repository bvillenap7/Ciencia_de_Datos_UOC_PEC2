Silver disk over Kennesaw, GA;2004-03-13 11:00:00;30 sec - 1 min;Silver disk over Kennesaw, GA On Sat. Mar. 13, around 11am, I was driving westbound on Ernest Barrett Parkway. Blue skies and a few white clouds. Suddenly, ahead of me (at about a 45 degree height) I saw what looked like a silver saucer doing acrobatics. It moved erratically, turning and dipping, then sped off a little to the right and stayed stationary. It stayed in this position another 10-15 seconds, then disappeared. I don't know how to judge the distance, but with my arm extended, I measured the distance that it filled between my thumb and forefinger (about a quarter inch.) A couple of days before this, I saw a different silver UFO about 10 miles east of here in Marietta. Very surprising.;34.020232330827;-84.621397744361
