Bright orange light began moving and flashing;2012-04-22 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Bright orange light began moving and flashing I was sitting in my car in a public parking lot eating and I saw a very bright orange-reddish light in the sky. Immediately I thought it was Mars, but then it started moving really slowly and the light dwindled and it started flashing a crimson color.

((Advertising lights??));2020-01-09 18:05:00;10 minutes;3-5 white balls of light circled around, met in the middle, and continued this pattern for about 10 minutes. There were about 3-5 white circular shapes swirling around in circles and then meeting in the middle. They were very light and not very noticeable unless you were consistently looking at them, so it helped that it was already dark out. They were the most visible when they went across clouds.  It continued this pattern for about 10 minutes before I went back inside, so there’s no telling how long it was going on. I’m the distance there was one central ball of light behind some clouds, but that may have been the moon. At first I thought it could be a lamp causing it, but it was moving across the sky as I walked so the idea of a lamp is unlikely. Also, I looked around and saw nobody with a lamp. As I was walking, a fellow student turned to me and asked if I saw them too, so I know I wasn’t imagining things.;34.020232330827;-84.621397744361
