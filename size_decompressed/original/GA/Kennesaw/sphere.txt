Stars that run when you see them?;2002-11-14 04:35:00;1min;Stars that run when you see them? After comining home from work. I went down stiars to get on my turn tables like always. At about 4:30am or so I wanted to smoke a cig, but they were out side in the truck. So I then went to get them. As I walked out of the front door I felt like I was being followed. As I got to my truck I looked up into the cold night and saw what seem to be a bright star high above my house. As I got my cigs out of the truck I then looked back up at this bright star when it started to move. It moved side to side at very high speed and then started to back away as if it knew I had seen it. As it moved side to side it started to back away from me and get very tiny as if it didnt want me to see it anymore. Then it was gone. Not sure about what I had just seen I got very scared and ran back into the house. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We believe that celestial bodies would be the first possibility to be ruled out.  PD));34.020232330827;-84.621397744361
