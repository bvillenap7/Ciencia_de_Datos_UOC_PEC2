Mysterious light traveling North over Kennesaw, GA;2007-09-18 01:58:00;1 second;Mysterious light traveling North over Kennesaw, GA I was traveling North on Cobb Parkway (US 41) when I saw a streak of white light go across my sunroof. I thought to myself, cool a shooting star, except when it came into view in front of my windshield, it had no tail. Just a glowing sphere like object with no sound. I thought for something to be moving that fast it would have a loud sonic boom. It was traveling north at an extreme rate of speed. Probably well over 1000 mph, and then it went over the horizon. This lasted no more than one second. I thought to myself there is no way I just saw what I think I saw, maybe it was an just an airplane. I was within a half of a mile of the airport, so I drove by it to see if there was a plane on the runway. When I got there, I remembered that McCollum Field or Cobb County Airport only has one runway running East and West, no North and South runway. I pulled up the airports’ website and they are not even opened from midnight though six in the morning. I have seen hundreds of shooting stars before and I know what they look like. My house is across the street from the airport, so I have a good idea of what comes in and out of it. I have never believed in UFO’s or sophisticated intelligent life outside of Earth, but whatever I saw tonight was definitely not from around here. I have no idea what I saw but at age 20, I probably will not be going outside at night by myself for a long time and I will never sleep with my window open ever again. My description is that I am 20 years old, male, a junior at Kennesaw State University with a 3.4 GPA and currently a finance major. I enjoy hunting, fishing, trapshooting, and I spend the majority of my summers on the lake, I am a very outdoors person.;34.020232330827;-84.621397744361
