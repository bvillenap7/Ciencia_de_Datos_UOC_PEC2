saw black bell-shaped object hovering over I-575;2010-09-29 19:00:00;3 minutes;saw black bell-shaped object hovering over I-575 As a friend and I were driving home around dusk, we noticed a large, bell-shaped object hovering over I-575. There had just been a storm and we were noticing how strange the sunset looked when we first saw the object. It moved relatively slowly from side to side and at one point appeared to be spinning or doing some type of maneuvering. We ruled out the possibility of it being a bird, as there were no wings and it was quite large. It was also obviously not any sort of balloon or toy. I had never seen anything like this before. We tried to pull over, but by the time we did, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.020232330827;-84.621397744361
Witnessed two giant pulsating lights in sky over Kennesaw, Georgia;2012-07-28 22:45:00;5 minutes;Witnessed two giant pulsating lights in sky over Kennesaw, Georgia Since I live in Georgia, I tend to water my garden at night. While I was watering I hear my girlfriend yell &quotwhat the bleep is that in the sky?!&quot When I turned around and looked up there were two balls of pulsating light hovering in the sky. They pulsated from a deep red to a bright orange. At first they were motionless, lined up one on top of the other. Then, the one on top slowly descended to the lower one and they came very close to touching. It was obvious these things were being controlled/maneuvered.  There was no sound at all. They hovered for what seemed to be about 3-5 minutes and then slowly dimmed and flew off, changing speeds from very slow to rather quick movements. I checked for any reports around this area, something i've never done before and I have noticed that more people are seeing similar things around this area. I know tonight there was a meteor shower, but these objects were not meteors or comet debris. I spend enough time star gazing to know the difference.  These objects descended then ascended, never fully disappearing until they flew away. I have never seen anything like this in my life and it was a rather disturbing experience for my girlfriend.;34.020232330827;-84.621397744361
At approximately 12:55 pm, I was standing in my kitchen, near a window, when a bright flash of light appeared just outside the window.;2015-12-08 12:55:00;2-3 seconds;At approximately 12:55 pm, I was standing in my kitchen, near a window, when a bright flash of light appeared just outside the window.  It was as if someone was standing outside the window with a camera flash.   My daughter was in another room of the house, and also saw a bright flash of light from outside the front windows of the home.  It was a sunny day, no clouds in the sky, no rain anywhere. There were no people or vehicles outside the house that could have caused this.   I listened for reports on local news, but heard none.  Still unsure as to what this was.
