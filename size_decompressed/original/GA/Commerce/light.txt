White light over Jackson County/Commerce Georgia.  July, 2007.;2007-06-07 04:45:00;3 to 5 minutes;White light over Jackson County/Commerce Georgia.  July, 2007. I went for a walk about 4:40 AM.  My fiance works late, so we keep late hours.  I was about to go inside when I somehow felt I needed to walk to the end of our road.  I looked up, and thought, I don't remember a planet being in that part of the sky last night...  As I starred at it for a minute or two, it seemed to turn in on itself and wink out.  Now, being a rational person, yet open minded, I stood there and thought It must be a helicopter, but why don't I hear anything?  There was no sound at all, no aircraft in the area, and it was a crystal clear night.;34.2065470588235;-83.4412823529412
