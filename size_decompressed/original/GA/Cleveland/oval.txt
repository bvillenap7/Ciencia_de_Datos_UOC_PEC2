The Bus Stop;1999-02-20 07:00:00;5 minutes;As I walked to the bus stop at the bottom of the hill, I saw several lights, blinking in a sequence just over the trees.  The lights were different colors: red, green, yellow and blue.  The lights were arranged in a line diagonally.  The object was very close, but because of it still being dark out it was hard to make out the exact shape of the aircraft. I didn't tell a soul for several months afterwards.
