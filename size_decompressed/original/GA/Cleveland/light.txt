We were driving alone Hwy 129 towards Cleveland when we saw a green ball of light come down from the northeastern part of the sky, and ;1998-11-07 20:44:00;about 1 minute;We were driving alone Hwy 129 towards Cleveland when we saw a green ball of light come down from the northeastern part of the sky, and then it just kind of traveled in a downward, diagonal direction towards the southwest part of the sky.  It didn't look like a falling star...but if it wasn't a falling star....then what was it.  The sighting lasted for about a minute. A friend and I were traveling back to college from her home in Gainsville Georgia, we were talking on the carphone.  We both saw the green light come from the northeastern part of the sky and move to the southwestern part of the sky.  She hung-up on the person we were talking to and we looked at each other and asked did you see that?.  The light was traveling fast, but not as fast as a falling star.  It had a more 'determined' movement to it.  It was green in color and just looked like a ball of light.  It had not really a tail, but the color made a streak in the sky, like when you take a bright light and wave it in front of your eyes.  It leaves kind of an imprint.  After we saw this and made sure that we both saw the same thing we hurried back to school and asked our friends if they had seen anything wierd...they said no.;34.5875;-83.753
