I gauged the movement from between two power lines.  It only moved slightly over but did change positions for me to see a triangle shape to a line of changing color lights, which included white, green/blue, orange/red.   As I saw the triangle shape, I could only see white lights at each tip.  However, when it turned sideways, I could see a variety of colors but they did not have a certain changing pattern.   I took pictures from my iPhone, in which you can see the change in positions but the phone couldn't pick up the change in color due to the distance.
