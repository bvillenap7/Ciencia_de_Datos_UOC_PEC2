silent large titanium colored craft with black windows;1999-11-18 18:00:00;10 sec;silent large titanium colored craft with black windows Was standing in my yard looking at 5/8 moon.  As I looked there was a craft moving from left to right.  At first,  I thought it must be airliner,  but no vertical stabilizer, then no wings, no engines.  No sound,  no trail.  Figure it was 10 thousand ft altitude,  maybe 5 miles away. Almost a thumb width at arm's length. The color was that of a titanium golf iron or wood, very polished and seemed to be reflecting the sun.  But the sun was nearly down,  and the craft was not in a position to reflect any sunlight towards me. Craft was moving NE to SW  climbing at say 20% and accelerated out of sight. I've seen a drawing of this craft somewhere,  probably a book.;34.5875;-83.753
