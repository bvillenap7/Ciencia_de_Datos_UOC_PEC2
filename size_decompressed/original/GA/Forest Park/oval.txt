Unknown object seen in photo after download;2011-10-09 08:00:00;0;Unknown object seen in photo after download On the early morning of October 9th, T and I were driving away from the airport, I noticed a particular cloud formation not usually seen, and we were in awe of the big circular formation cloud in the lower right hand of the picture.  (It looked more beautiful than the picture shows)...   I asked T to take pictures of the circular cloud as I was driving (she tried to focus on the circular formation cloud on the lower right side of the picture).  When I downloaded all of my pictures today from my camera to my laptop and casually looked through them, I am uncertain as to just what was to the right of a plane captured in the left hand side of the picture?  This object is not in the other pictures she took so it can not be from the windshield...  I have other pictures and the object is not in them!... Just wanted to share and see if anyone else wanted to take a more in depth lookâ€¦;33.6143;-84.3716
