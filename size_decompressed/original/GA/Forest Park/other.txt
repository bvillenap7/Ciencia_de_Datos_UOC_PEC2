Stingray-like drone shaped craft, solid bright white, no engines, no windows, no wings, no rudder, no exhaust, no markings flying low.;1979-07-03 08:00:00;15-30 seconds;Stingray-like drone shaped craft, solid bright white, no engines, no windows, no wings, no rudder, no exhaust, no markings flying low. Driving home from work one morning (1979), I saw a UFO.  It was bright solid while, shaped like a (modern drone), stingray or maybe an egg.  It had no lights, no markings, no windows, no wings, no tail rudder, no visible rotors or engine, and no visible exhaust.   It appeared to be flying low and slow in and out of low white cumulus clouds on a bright sunny blue sky day.  I saw it for about 15 to 30 seconds, and then it went into another cloud and did not come out the other side as I expected.  Until now I have only told a few people, I just wanted there to be a record.  This was in the summer of 1979.  On or about July 3rd, around 8:00 am.   Best regards. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.6143;-84.3716
