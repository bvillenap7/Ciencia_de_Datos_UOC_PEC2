Large white light falling at a fast rate that produced orange and red flames that just disappeared.;2011-10-24 19:21:00;15/20 seconds;Large white light falling at a fast rate that produced orange and red flames that just disappeared. It stared off as a very large round ball of light in the northeastern sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane light.After watching it for 4 or 5 sec.and seeing other airplanes to the south of it that were extremley smaller, I noticed it falling down at a very fast rate.  It was just left of a bright star or planet in the eastern sky.It was about 4 or 5 times as big as the star / planet.  As it fell it started producing a burnt orange and red  flames on the bottom giving the appearnce of it being bigger on the bottom.Just above the treeline it just disappeared.  I thought a plane had gone down but there were no fragments, it just disappeared.  I even called the airport to see if a plane had gone down.  They just kind of laughed and said no.  Watched the object maybe a total of 20 seconds.  On the 25th I even called nasa to see if a large meteorite had fallen, but no response.;33.667;-83.8717
