6 to 10 blinking lights moving at different speeds;2013-10-18 21:30:00;1 minute;6 to 10 blinking lights moving at different speeds My girlfriend and I were out looking at clouds at night.  We noticed there were many blinking lights moving in the sky.   Our original thought was that they were stars, then we noticed they were blinking.   Then we thought it was one craft, but they were all moving in different directions at different speeds.  Some were moderately fast and some were very slow.   This was in the small park down Wesley Street from Haygood Hall. (Oxford College of Emory University);33.667;-83.8717
