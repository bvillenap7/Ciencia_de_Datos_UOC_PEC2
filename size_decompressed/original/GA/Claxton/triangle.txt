Simular wing lines to the War of the Worlds movie.;2008-02-20 13:30:00;about fifteen to twenty m;Simular wing lines to the War of the Worlds movie. My friend and I were hunting beaver for bounty. We drove to a place near Edgar Hodges road southwest of Claxton, Ga. The object at first appeared to be atationary for the first ten minutes or so as we watched. I looked at the craft through a rifle scope and binoculars.  The craft itself appeared to be of a gray color.  It quartered away to our left.  It's shape was odd in that it was triangular with what was visible with bowed sweept wings from its center.  Although it was less than a mile to the object at a guess from us.  Totally silent.  The flashing low level lights made the rear of the craft appear rounded. The flashing white lights were just around the uderedge of its wings.  You couldn't quite see anything but the light itself and the little of the craft that was visible in this light.  It looked like the light was a by product of its propulsion.  It didn't much look like it should be flying at all with the trailing edges of its wings being so rounded.  The flashing intensified when the claft started to move away from us. A light at the end of each wing just around the edge of it.  A center light that had this same peculiar appearance of being just around the edge of the craft.  There were probly three or four smaller flashings between the center and each wing tip.  These also just appeared to be around the edge of this wing.  The intensity as well as the time cycle of this flashing also inceased as the craft moved silenty away to the west, I think, from us.
