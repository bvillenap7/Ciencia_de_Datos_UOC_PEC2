White light following large jet.;2015-09-21 21:30:00;15 seconds;White light following large jet. I saw a jet airplane flying much lower than normal and in an unusual direction (almost straight west instead of the usual southwest direction toward Atlanta).  Approximately 1/4 mile behind it was a white light shaped like a teardrop.  Much smaller than the plane itself.  I watched it until it reached the tree line and the light seemed to be getting closer to the jet as it left my sight.;34.0861;-83.7840000000001
