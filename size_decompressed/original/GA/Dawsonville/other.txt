Metallic balloon shaped object hovering in a beautiful blue sky.;2007-10-21 14:00:00;15 minutes;Metallic balloon shaped object hovering in a beautiful blue sky. We were watching a red single engine plane circle around an object. The object, seen through binoculars, was a large metallic balloon shape.  The balloon glared like it was made of metal.  It had a rod of some sort coming out of the bottom. The object was a silvery white.  The wind was blowing hard at the ground but this thing did not move, sway or rise like you would expect a balloon to do. The rod looked metal.  We watched for about 15 minutes then it began to move north. Then the object disappeared.  The single engine plane was only there for the first 5 minutes then it flew away.;34.4512;-84.153
((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star.  PD));2009-07-11 23:00:00;30 minutes;As me and my friend were walking around town, we were in an open field and we looked up to the stars. When my friend noticed a twinkling star that looked a little out of place. It had seem to be moving in sporadic movements. then it had started moving across the sky in a zig-zag pattern and started blinking. Then on the other side of the sky we had saw another object just like it and they moved towards each other. Then when they had met they started to circle around each other and things had started breaking off of it in all directions. Then both of them had slowly dissipated into the sky. And a few moments later an object that had seem to be invisible but still noticeable had 3 lights and was HUGE and moved across the sky and disappeared into the lights emitting off of shops and other things in the city.
