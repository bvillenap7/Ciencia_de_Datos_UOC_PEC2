There were lights covering it and it made it hard to make out the exact shape, but as said before, It imitated a large drone.;2019-01-24 21:30:00;5 minutes;I was in bed, watching TV around 9:30 PM when I heard these loud choppers flying very low. I got out of bed to look outside and sure enough, there were two military choppers flying very low over my house. I watched them fly by and went back inside. When I still heard the choppers, I turned to look out of the windows on my front door. Thatâ€™s when I saw strange lights in the sky.  I walked outside and saw some sort of aircraft flying very low, at first the aircraft kind of looked like a large drone.  As it approached closer, I realized it was much too large to be a drone.  It was shaped more like an octagon from what I could tell and had red and white lights all over it.  There were lights covering it and it made it hard to make out the exact shape, but as said before, it imitated a large drone. It was the size of a commercial aircraft, flying not much higher than the trees and making zero noise. I watched it fly over my house, it made a circle over our property and then flew in the same direction that the choppers flew in.  I was completely freaked out. I was not a believer in these until now.  I noted that my dogs responded to the event because they were missing for hours (until right after the aircraft passed through).  They never leave our house far enough to not come when I call them to come inside (especially in 30 degree weather). As soon as the aircraft passed by, they were back on the porch.  I am beating myself up because I left my phone in the bedroom and was not able to capture a picture.;34.4512;-84.153
