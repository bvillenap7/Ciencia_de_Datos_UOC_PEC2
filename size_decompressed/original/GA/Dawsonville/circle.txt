Glowing green ball of light moving across the sky near Lake Lanier.;2014-06-19 21:30:00;5 seconds;Glowing green ball of light moving across the sky near Lake Lanier. I was sitting outside of the lake house on Lake Lanier just off of Nix Rd.  I was looking up at the sky when out of nowhere I saw a (one) green glowing ball that just appeared and it was moving slowly but steadily across the sky until my view was blocked by tree lines.  It was not leaving any trails but I could definitely see a solid green ball in the middle and it was glowing green all around it.;34.4512;-84.153

Green orb over Lake Lanier.;2014-08-24 23:00:00;5 minutes 1minute;Green orb over Lake Lanier. Sitting on dock at lake lanier, on Nix Rd, my girlfriend & I witnessed a total of 5 orange lights & 1 green...something. Over the horizon to our east, 3 orange lights appeared to be rising, all in a vertical line, the top light circled counter clockwise & disappeared, followed by the other 2.  Then another came up, followed the same course.  Then another. Maybe 20 min later, as we were leaving, I saw a bright light coming from my left, bright enough to cast shadows from the trees around me.  I turned to see...a large green orb/ball slowly moving over the lake, just behind the tops of the trees, which are no more than 60ft tall.  I only saw it for a couple of seconds before it disappeared.  It had no tail & made no noise.  I turned to ask my girlfriend if she had seen that, but she was about 20 ft behind me...& had been watching this green orb/ball move across the tree line for maybe 100 yards.;34.4512;-84.153
Bright white circular light doing figure 8 motions, oval motions, and straight dir. motions.  ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial object.  PD));2017-02-01 23:00:00;2 hours;Bright white circular light doing figure 8 motions, oval motions, and straight directional motions. At 2300 hours, I looked out my bedroom window and noticed a bright white star shaped object moving slightly in the sky.  I then showed my wife who agreed the star was moving.  I put on a jacket and went outside for a better look and noticed this star/light was moving alot. I held my hand up to the sky and measured with my fingers 2-3 inches in diameter that this light was moving.  It was doing figure 8 motions and oval motions and also straight directional motions.  I woke my mother to come look, she could not identify it.  I stayed outside for 2 hours with my mouth open watching this strange phenomenon.  It continues now even as I write this.  I will look again tomorrow night to see if it is still there. ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial object.  PD));34.4512;-84.153
UFO sighting in Dawsonville Georgia;2019-11-18 18:15:00;5 minutes;UFO sighting in Dawsonville Georgia We saw what looked to be a light strung up high in the air, at first we thought it was a helicopter due to how low it was but then we noticed it was a circle shape. And it did not move at all, so we thought it was a light, but there is nothing that high to string it up from. Thought maybe a drone, but no movement.  Then it slowly started moving, then after a bit of time (maybe 3 minutes) we lose it as it seemed to travel upwards and got smaller and smaller. Then disappears.  We got it on video.  But the video does not show what it looked like in person.;34.4512;-84.153
