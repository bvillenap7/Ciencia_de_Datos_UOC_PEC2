Unusual;2013-09-28 19:45:00;30 seconds;unusual Walking dog with husband at appr 7:45 pm in Loganville, Ga   Noticed a silent,  slow moving  round bright white object in sky.  Seemed to be closer than aircraft normally travel in this area.  It was traveling in an eastern  direction.  It suddenly seemed to break apart into appr 5 more spheres that were evenly spaced and traveled for appr 15 seconds before disappearing.  From my first encounter the duration was less than 30 seconds.  Could have been longer but I didnt notice.;33.878;-83.8923
