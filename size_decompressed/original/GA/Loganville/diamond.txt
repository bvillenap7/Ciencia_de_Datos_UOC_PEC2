Diamond Shaped Metal Object in Broad Daylight;2016-10-17 10:35:00;12 minutes;Diamond Shaped Metal Object in Broad Daylight I spotted something metal in the sky on my way to school. I had to pull over for gas very close to the place that I spotted the thing.  When I pulled into the gas station I continued to stare at the sky trying to figure out if I was seeing things.  I tried to rule out anything rational ie balloon, toy, kite, etc.  The entire time I was staring at it, it hovered in the same place.  It was a dark metal color.  It looked like a diamond or a square turned on its side. It appeared to hover for a few minutes and I saw what looked like a dark red blinking from one portion of it.  Not like a light but as if the entire portion was flickering in a code.  I watched it hover like that and then it went straight up and eventually out of view.  After this I texted my mother and my husband.  Neither of them had a comment.  I am well aware of how crazy these things sound to people who’ve never experienced it.  This is the first solid object that I have seen.  I have noticed many things! in the night sky, recently, that move at speeds and heights that don’t fit with what we are educated about in this country.  This is the first day-time, full view and solid object I have experienced.;33.878;-83.8923
