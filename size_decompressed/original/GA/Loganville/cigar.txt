Cigar shaped silver object larger than schoolbus, witnessed by kids and bus driver;1969-04-01 07:00:00;15  sec;Cigar shaped silver object larger than schoolbus, witnessed by kids and bus driver My mother was on a school bus, it was dawn but still dark. They picked up a little girl who was hysterical, she said an object bigger than the bus was above the pond across the road from her house.  When the bus came up over the hill, the object began to ascend.  The bus driver and all the kids on board exited the bus and saw the object. It was cigar shaped with three lights.  Mom says it was silver.  It was still rising then the three lights separated and shot off into different directions.  When they arrived at school, no one believed the bus driver or any of the students.   Mom saw this same little girl now an adult years later and asked if she remembered the event and she said she did and would never forget it.  There is some confusion as to if the object rose from the pond. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));33.878;-83.8923
