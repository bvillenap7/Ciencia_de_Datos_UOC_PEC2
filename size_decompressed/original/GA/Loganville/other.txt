lighting the whole woods up 3 times as bright as the moon.;2004-05-20 02:00:00;25 min;A partner and myself were walking in the woods one night training in a martial art known as X. After an exhausting train session, we started to walk home and thats when things began to get odd. With no flash light we followed by the light of the moon dogs began to bark, through out the woods, and through the neighborhood (ahead about 25 min. walk). I pulled out some kiwi and coconut and we began to eat while walking. About to the entrance of the neighborhood we looked up just about the time it happened and an orb shot up toward the moon leaving a light streak when it paused it had a huge flash of light, lighting the whole woods up 3 times as bright as the moon.;33.878;-83.8923
