Running south west parallel the rode pointe drive.  White orange orb, fire ball. 20 to 40k feet Look I don't know what I saw...but I have looked to the skies my whole life and this doesn't fit with anything I know...my first thought was to call 911.... I live in loganville ,ga.  The sky is always full of planes etc. I am sitting on my back porch watching tv...( don't blow me off for this part ) I have had a couple ,3 beers..  Relaxing after work.  I have never in my life seen anything in the sky that doesn't fit there.....until tonite...  Not a believer, or nut case about extraterrestrial visitors etc. but the whole idea of so many stars etc, how can we be the only planet to have life etc.... I don't know but I am leaning way towards thinking there is something to this.....I stepped outside into the grass off the patio, and saw a white orange orb shape moving south almost parallel with rose pointe drive , to the east.  The color at first made me think it might be a firework or something...as it passed behind the trees on the back yard I got that it was wrong because there was no arch....and it seemed to be moving too fast at a too high altitude....  I quickly moved a half dozen stepps into the yard to see it come out from behind the trees...  And I was sure this was all wrong ,to all I know ...  It continued at a great speed level and right until it disappeared.  My cell phone battery is the only reason I didn't call 911.  I am sure beyond any doubt this object what ever it was...  Is beyond the technology I understand we have today.;33.878;-83.8923
