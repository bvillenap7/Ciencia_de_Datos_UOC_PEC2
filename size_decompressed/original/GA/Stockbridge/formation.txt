There were three lights in the sky. The lights were very close together in a triangle formation.  They were too close together to be planes and there were no flashing lights like planes have.  The lights darted off in different directions one went up the other two went side ways.  Two disappeared and then one of the lights darted back to the original position.  The single light hovered for a few seconds then darted off to the right and disappeared after a few seconds.;33.5636999999992;-84.2112000000019
