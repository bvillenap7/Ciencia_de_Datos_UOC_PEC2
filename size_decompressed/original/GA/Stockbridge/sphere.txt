Spherical metallic object hovering over Stockbridge;2014-10-10 15:00:00;1 hour;Spherical metallic object hovering over Stockbridge While in our backyard this afternoon, my wife and I saw a shiny object that appeared to be hovering/floating well above aircraft altitudes over our house.  It was mostly stationary, but slowly headed in a southerly direction opposite cloud movement.   We attempted to take pictures, but the altitude was too high to get a good picture.   Looking at the object with a rifle scope, it appeared to be a perfect sphere in shape and either a white or metallic color as it was reflecting light from the sun off of it.   After observing it for about an hour, we lost interest and went back inside our home.;33.5636999999992;-84.2112000000019
