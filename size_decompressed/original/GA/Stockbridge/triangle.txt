green lights in triangle pattern hovering above trees and strange dreams for 2 months after.;1999-10-15 23:00:00;1 minute;green lights in triangle pattern hovering above trees and strange dreams for 2 months after. Travelling south on I-75 in stockbridge, just as I came to where I-675 merges into 75, there were three green lights in a triange pattern hovering above the trees between the two interstates where they came together.  The light was coming down from the clouds as if the source of the light was just a few feet above the bottom of the clouds.  They hovered in the same spot for at least 30 seconds, rotating the whole time.  There were three other people in the car with me that saw it.  It was absolutely amazing!!  The only that that bothers me about it and makes other people critical about it when I tell them, is the fact that for about 2 months after I had strange dreams.  In the dreams, I was lying on a metal table in a dark room.  The walls were grey, and there was one lamp shining down at my body from behind my head.  I saw at least five humanoid silhouettes standing around me, and I could hear them talking, and I could tell that they were talking about me, but it sounded like mumbling, so I couldn't tell what they were saying.  One of them on my left side leaned over to get a closer look at me, and his face went into the light a little, so I could see him pretty good.  I could tell it was a male because of his presentation, and he had some male human characteristics.  Immediately after his face went into the light, he was scolded by the person standing next to him, then I seemed to be able to understand their language by telepathy, and I could hear them telling him that they would have to send me back because now I know what they look like.

bright lights hover then hit warp speed then go separate ways;2005-06-15 22:00:00;30 sec.;bright lights hover then hit warp speed then go separate ways That night I was driving to work and saw 2 bright lights in the sky directly in front of me.  Both seemed to be hovering motionless which seemed a little unusual so I watched them closely.  Both objects simultaneously accelerated at a rate which I did not know was possible.  Then both objects in unison slowed down to normal speed and crossed paths to go their separate ways. 	 About 5 to 6 minutes later in town I saw a triangle shaped craft overhead.  I have been around airplanes, both military and commercial for 15 plus years and have never seen anything move at those speeds!  The only thing I can compare it to is going to warp speed like you see on T.V. 	 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We saw definitively a black craft in the rough shape of a triangle, moving very slowly at a low altitude in silence that night.;2009-11-13 20:00:00;2 minutes;We saw definitively a black craft in the rough shape of a triangle, moving very slowly at a low altitude in silence that night. My father and I were driving down the road heading towards an intersection with what appeared to be what we could only guess from a distance was a helicopter.  I made a comment that the police must be looking for somebody because it appeared to have very bright lights, my assumption was spotlights.  We got to the intersection and it still was it seemed maybe a 1/2 mile away still, so we took a left on our intended route.  I kept watching it however and it was slowly moving towards us.  After a short time it passed directly over the top of us.  I turned the radio off and let me window down as my father opened the moonroof on the car and slowed.  It was maybe 500 ft. up and moving VERY slowly, approx. guess would be 40 - 50 miles and hour, with ABSOLUTE silence.   As it passed we could vaguely see the outline of the craft in the dark sky, which we can only describe as somewhat stealth-like and in the rough shape of a B2 bomber.  It had a very bright light on ! the front of the craft (or at least the part that was in front) and a light on each other corner.  All were white.  It did not spin or move off course in any way, almost appearing to have been fixed in its course, but once again, in dead silence and a constant speed that could have easily been kept up with in our car without breaking any speed laws.  It was very dark, I could only guess black.;33.5636999999992;-84.2112000000019
