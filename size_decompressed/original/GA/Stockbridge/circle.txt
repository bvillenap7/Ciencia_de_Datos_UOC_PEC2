Facing South, I was watching a plane leaving a trail through the sky when I spotted what looked alot like a star in the daytime sky. I watched it hover in the same place for well over 15 minutes.  Several planes passed during this time but this object stayed still.  Then slowly moved very slightly toward the West and I lost sight of it in a dark grey cloud, in an otherwise clear sky with occasional white puffy clouds.;33.5636999999992;-84.2112000000019
Amazing sightings on Fourth of July!!;2014-07-04 21:50:00;10 minutes;Amazing sightings on Fourth of July!! The UFO's that we saw were circular.  Two had an orange glow & one had a red glow all of which had a foggy circular fog around them.   They all seemed to move very fast & in the same flight pattern!!  Exactly the same flight pattern!!   They flew sideway in the sky & contained to move upward until they disappeared in the sky.   They were two fast to be an airplane or helicopter & DEFINITLEY not anything to do with fireworks!!   The fact that they could move side to side extremely fast was crazy!!  It was AMAZING!!!!;33.5636999999992;-84.2112000000019
It happened so quickly. I was sitting in the car and had been outside since I got out of school watching my show on Netflix.My sister k;2016-05-03 21:06:00;25 seconds;It happened so quickly.  I was sitting in the car and had been outside since I got out of school watching my show on Netflix.  My sister knocked on the car window and said mama want you to come in so I got my things and while I was walking into the motel room and going into the room walking past the car and I heard a air hissing, roaring, whirring (indescribable) and it floating over me and stayed there for about 7 seconds as long as I was able to stand it.  so I yelled my mom's name and told her I saw a UFO and I left back outside.. and me and my siblings saw it just shoot up the sky and when it made it before our eyes we saw that when it went far enough its colors two that stay red and one that was a slow but bright green.  It went far where to me by a bright star and we we're still able to make out the colors which is a long way by the time it shot less that 5 seconds into the air that its light made a triangle..  I was and still am shocked.  I was distinctly able ! to make out it's shape and there we're planes around..  I know what a Plane or helicopter looks like and it was so unbelievable I would think nobody ever believed me and I wish that I weren't the only to see it while it was visible to my eye..  I wish I could have video recorded it but if I could just see it againâ€¦;33.5636999999992;-84.2112000000019
