My wife and daughter returned to the house after getting something to eat to bring back home. My wife said to me immediately when they walked in the house that her and our daughter witnessed something but they dont know what it was. She said if you dont believe me our daughter(10yr old) saw this too, my daughter spoke up promptly saying its true and proceeded to describe a flash of light that crossed the road they were traveling on in the car. My wife was following up on her description as both of them were exicted to tell me. As it was approx. 9:50 PM returning home on a road that has a small wooded section within our populated city a brite flash  oval like object scoured across the front (approx. 6-8 feet) of the vehicle from left to right. The light even reflected off the front of the minivan and traveled at eye level horizontal from one section of woods to the other side. As it happened very sudden my wife described a stretched white bright flash oval object about the size of our computer screen which, is a 17 screen. It was difficult for her to describe as she never seen anything like this. Our daughter described the same details but she caught a better glimpse. She described a odd shape oval that was very bright itself with a glow of less light and a cast of light from the glow. I had her sketch a drawing to show me what she saw. I will definitely keep the drawing for our records and send a copy to the reporting center. After they told me I drove out and traveled the same route but, did not notice anything unusal. I may go back during daylight and take look around.;33.5636999999992;-84.2112000000019
