Very Shiny, Possible V shape and traveled very slow.;2010-12-02 03:15:00;5 minutes;Very Shiny, Possible V shape and traveled very slow. Went out on my back deck to retrieve some batteries that I had placed in the sun to recharge(Saves Money). While I was getting the batteries I saw a very bright shiny UFO traveling WSW at a very slow pace. I watched it for about 2 minutes.  I then went in the house and told my wife she had to come see what I was looking at. We both stood there for a couple more minutes and I told her I was going in to get the binoculars to get a better look.  The UFO was about a 1/2 mile to a mile from us and approximately 1000 to 1500 feet off the ground.As I was focusing in on it my wife heard a jet from behind us.  We both turned our heads to see where the jet was and when we turned back around the UFO was gone.  We didn't see where the jet went because went back inside after the UFO disappeared.  No clouds no sound, not even a dog or bird made any noises. Cell phone showed a blur. The UFO was Very shiny ,no wings no light could be seen. It was bigger that a 747 jet and traveled slower than any plane could have.;33.7722;-85.0143
