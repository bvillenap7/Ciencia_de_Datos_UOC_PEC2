Bright red light in sky in same spot over 10 mins with no sound.;2020-08-16 21:00:00;10 minutes;Bright red light in sky in same spot over 10 mins with no sound. Bright stationary red light above home.  Light would stay on approximately 10 seconds then completely go out for around 3 seconds then re appear.  There was no rhythm to the light.  Sometimes it would stay on longer over a minute then go out.  It flickered on and off very fast a few times.   After about 10 mins it started to move very slow behind the trees and we could still see it behind the trees but then eventually disappeared as the light went out and never come back on.  Through this whole sighting there was never any other blinking lights on or around this bright red light to indicate it was an airplane, drone, helicopter or blimp.  There was no sound coming from this object.;33.7722;-85.0143
