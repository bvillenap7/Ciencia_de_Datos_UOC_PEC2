Green ball of light with orange tip falling from the sky.;2014-11-20 21:20:00;5 seconds;Green ball of light with orange tip falling from the sky. On the drive home from the gym my mother and I saw a large green ball falling from the sky with an orange light in the front.   It looked like it was going to land on the earth but it disappeared behind the trees before we could see anything more.   It was between a quarter and a third of the size of the moon.;33.8440893617021;-84.0165808510638
Flaming craft head towards me from the north then stalls and heads east.;2017-08-26 10:31:00;5 minutes;Flaming craft head towards me from the north then stalls and heads east. An object in the sky approached from the north and appeared to be flying at plane height.  As the object approached it appeared to be engulfed in a large flaming ball.  The o ject stalled the headed east and travelled slightly erratically, not flying straight.  I snapped a picture with my phone then started to take a short video.  I began to be sure it was flames engulfing the object then i ran to grab my wife.  She and i watched the object head east slowly.  The flames appeared to gutter out and the object went black.;33.8440893617021;-84.0165808510638
