Observed silver top in sky and then blinked out.;2006-12-15 11:43:00;10 seconds;Observed silver top in sky and then blinked out. The sky was clear blue and it was 11:43am EST on December 15, 2006.  I was driving down Hwy. 78 West in Snellville, GA and I leaned forward to look out my windshield for no real reason. The traffic was had slowed a bit.  I saw what looked like a top and it was silver way up in the sky.  There were no contrails nor any noise. It looked like it was going vertical and I strained my eyes to get a better look at it.  I looked away for one second and when I looked back it blinked out. I did not see any lights.  It happened so fast that I thought I had imagined the whole thing but I know what I saw.;33.8440893617021;-84.0165808510638
Fast object traveling west seen around 9:30, bearing red lights;2008-03-17 21:30:00;<1 second;Fast object traveling west seen around 9:30, bearing red lights It was a beautiful night, with a ¾ moon with thin cloud coverage coming and going. I was relaxing in a hot tub in my back yard and just staring up (at an estimated 65-75 degree angle) when I happen to look directly at a fairly large (estimated school bus-sized) object with red lights appear, then quickly disappear (at an estimated 50 degree location) in the sky. It was obviously traveling at speeds faster than an airplane, which I admit, I am in an area where planes fly by frequently, but this is how I know it was not an airplane. One of the most odd things I noticed about the object was it’s motion. I seemed to be making very close swerves, like a back and forth motion. They were not large movements, but noticeable in spite of it’s speed and duration of appearance. I also noticed that the object was below the cloud coverage, or seemed to be. I was very sure of this detail at the time, but looking back I question whether it was only my eyes telling me that, due to the thinness of cloud coverage. Accordingly, if it were not below the clouds, it would have been much larger than I thought. The object was traveling West-southwest.;33.8440893617021;-84.0165808510638
blue light/craft(?), erratic movements, incredible speed, seen in distance in night sky;2019-11-06 18:30:00;10 seconds;blue light/craft(?), erratic movements, incredible speed, seen in distance in night sky I don’t have much information as I saw this distant in the sky. However, it was nighttime so it was easy to see. All I could see was a blue light or ufo (don’t know whether there was an actual craft, it was too far away). It “flew” in an erratic movement in the sky- like how cursive writing looks against paper, and it just “disappeared” (I put that in quotes because it might not have disappeared so much as it “flew” out of sight with such incredible speed that it didn’t display a gradual dimming of lights as you’d customarily see when a car drives out of sight down a road, for example.);33.8440893617021;-84.0165808510638
