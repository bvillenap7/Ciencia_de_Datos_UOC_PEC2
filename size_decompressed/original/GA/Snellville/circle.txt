Red silent light far up in the sky going at a fast pace;2012-04-09 22:00:00;late night walk;Red silent light far up in the sky going at a fast pace My mother and I was out doing our nightly walk with our dogs and she called me over to where she was.  She saw what she thought were two stars, but they started getting closer together.  Eventually when I got over there, one of them just took off and I saw the other one which was red in color move at a fast pace along the sky.  We see airplanes come and go often since we aren't that far from Hartsfield/Jackson airport in Atlanta.  We did not hear any noise at all like when regular aircrafts go over.  The red light eventually vanished.;33.8440893617021;-84.0165808510638
Moving light sphere.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of a star or planet.  PD));2016-12-07 19:15:00;105 minutes;Moving light sphere. I saw what I thought was first a star.  As I looked, it appeared to be sort of too spread out to be a star.   I then went and got my binoculars.  It was definitely was not a star.  It moved very slowly and was dropping further behind the tree and descending.  It was initially high in the sky and then started descending.   I then went and got my wife's phone and took a couple of shots and a video from a distance because I had to walk down the road to maintain my view.;33.8440893617021;-84.0165808510638
