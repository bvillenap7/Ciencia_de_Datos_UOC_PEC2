Loud and large (size of football field), rectangular (black) aircraft over Snellville, GA;2014-08-29 21:50:00;15 minutes;Loud and large (size of football field), rectangular (black) aircraft over Snellville, GA I was getting food at Del Taco’s drive through in Snellville, when I heard a loud noise overhead that I thought was a large helicopter (or maybe more than one helicopter as it was so loud).   Driving off, I decided to stop in the adjacent parking lot so I could watch the helicopter.  Got out of my car to look up into the sky (it was dark as it was almost 10 pm) and what I saw made my jaw drop!   It was a very large aircraft – probably the size of a football field (or at least half of one!) – Definitely rectangular in shape, dark – probably black.  It had an orange blinking light at the center of the base of it and a few other lights around it.   It moved very, very slowly.  In the distance, I could see it turn to the left, almost hovering as it did so.   I thought it might have been military, but in case it is not.  I wanted to report it in case anyone else saw it.  Anyone out that night would have seen and heard this monstrosity in the sky!  I thought it was the StarShip Enterprise, only it was of a black, rectangular shape – no wings or anything else protruding at all.   Very, very eerie!;33.8440893617021;-84.0165808510638
