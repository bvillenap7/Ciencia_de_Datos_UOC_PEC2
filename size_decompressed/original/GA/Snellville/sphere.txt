Glowing Orbs over Snellville, GA, on July 4th, 2014.;2014-07-04 21:00:00;5 minutes;Glowing Orbs over Snellville, GA, on July 4th, 2014. The area park across from City Hall, in Snellville, GA, was packed full of people enjoying a variety of food vendors, bands, and festivities, before the crowning event fireworks display a little later in the evening. I was standing in line to buy an ice cream when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.  Looking up, I saw two red glowing orbs moving very slowly towards us.  There was no sound - although if there were, I probably wouldn’t have heard it above the music – just a gentle pulse of warm light. I asked the boy in front of me what he thought they were and he just shrugged.  The orbs then stopped and just hung in the sky for a couple of minutes and then, moments later, the two objects took off in the direction from which they came at what seemed to be warp speed because in a millisecond they had become just two tiny points of light before disappearing.  I’m not sure if anyone else saw them or not as I didn’t see anyone else besides myself and the boy looking up.;33.8440893617021;-84.0165808510638
