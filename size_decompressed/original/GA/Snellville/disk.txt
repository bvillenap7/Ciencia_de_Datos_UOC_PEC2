Could see strange lights coming down in a unnatural pattern.  As if flickering white fire. Thought it was a plane falling from the sky at first.  Object got closer to the woods and it was obvious at that point it was disk/saucer shaped.  Seemed as if it was spinning, but in complete control.  The lights dimmed significantly as it got closer.  Object  did not make sound as far as I know but our dogs were absolutely losing it.  Stuck in awe.  By the time we reached to record the object, it made sporadic movements forward/ backward/side/side but then appeared as if it just vanished.  Against our better judgement, but we were searching woods to see if it shot up or is hiding in lower tree lines.;33.8440893617021;-84.0165808510638
