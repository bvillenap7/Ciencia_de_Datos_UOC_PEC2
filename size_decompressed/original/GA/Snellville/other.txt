Daylight Meteor / Space Debris;2001-09-23 10:30:00;30 Seconds;Daylight Meteor / Space Debris On Sunday September 23, 2001 at approximately 10:30 AM EDT my wife and son saw what appeared to be a daylight meteor or space debris traveling from NNE to NNW. They were located between Stone Mountain and Snellville, GA at that time. The object had a forked white tail that resembled that of a comet. The head of the object was pencil point size and the forked tail about 2 inches long and the width of a pencil at arm's length. It appeared to traveling downward and took approximately 30 seconds to pass from overhead to below the horizon. They didn't hear any noise.;33.8440893617021;-84.0165808510638
