Hovering Sphere;1975-01-01 19:00:00;5 - 10 min;Hovering Sphere Late one evening my family and I were traveling to/from Ellaville Georgia, when I saw a very large glowing sphere (moon-like) hovering about 200 feet above an open field and less than a 500 feet from the road we were traveling on in Waverly Hall.  I do not recall that it made any sound, but at moments it appeared to be elliptical and the intensity of the light it emitted would rise and fall as it changed shape.  I do not recall the exact date but I couldn't have been more than six years of age.  I am now 34 and I remember it as if it were yesterday.  This may be related to a simular report which I have included below. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting above is approximate.  PD))  Occurred : 2/1/1971 18:30 (Entered as : 02/01/71 1830) Reported: 6/17/1998 18:35 Posted: 3/21/2003 Location: Waverly Hall, GA Shape: Circle Duration:45-50 minutes saw bright circular object almosr directly overhead and moving down to hover 200 yds to our right and about 100 ft above ground. Ist thought it was moon but crescent moon was just above horizon. Object paralleled us as we drove slowly, stopping when we stopped going when we started again.  we drove about 5 miles slowly but took old Warm Springs Rd. instead of 4 lane into Columbus. As dusk was almost complete I got out and walked toward it and watched for some 10-15 minutes. Suddenly I had the feeling it was gone but the object simply faded slowly as if it left behind a mist. Within the haze red green and bluish lights could be seen moving but did not seem to be spot lights, more like flood lights. It was strange that it stayed with us for so long staying the same distance and height above the trees from us except when we turned off it crossed eaterly to the opposite side of the road. Although the timeframe was long neither my (now ex-)wife noticed any missing time. it was truly remarkable to us from when first seen it was so bright and moved rather rapidly but as it slowed and paralleled us through this little speed-trap town it got dimmer and changed from the bright full moon shape to the definite football shape. It seemed to us we were seeing it edge-on as it paralleled us. Numerous other cars behind us should have seen it also but noone stopped and watched but us. I had a camera with me but had used up the film. On a recent get together in Ga when my mother died, my ex-wife and I discussed this event and she seemed to remember it the same as I remember it. Later that month we moved to Texas. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.6773;-84.7438
