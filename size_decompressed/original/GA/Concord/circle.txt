I was walking toward my friends house to shoot some bats.  I was getting close to the house but then a circle shaped saucer flew right by me I have no video or pictures but my description is good enough.  It was also redish orange about the size of a frisby.  It was freaky man. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax??  PD));33.0968;-84.4468
