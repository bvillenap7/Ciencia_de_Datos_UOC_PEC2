Was not a plane and lights where extremely bright.;2012-01-28 20:50:00;6 minutes;Was not a plane and lights where extremely bright. While driving on 88 west from Wrens and about 2 miles from Wrens.  I saw to my right bright shinning lights.  The object had 2 red lights parellel to one another in the center and white light forming either a diamond shape or a triangle shape of white lights with the 2 red lights in the middle.  I was driving at around 55 mph and the object seemed to not run ahead of me as I stayed with it.   When I came to tree lines and valleys as I drove I would lose site of it.  Each time I again saw it the lights had moved more ahead of me.  The last good look at it was when it was just past the lighted tower on Gamble Mill rd.  I went down in a valley and lost site of it and when I got to where I had last saw it,it was gone.I sped to 80 mph and finally saw it again miles ahead and over the tree line.  It then just vanished into the clouds.  Called my friend who lives near the tower and she said her dogs had just started barking and went crazy on them.  They had never done that before so they checked outside but seen nothing.  I know other people saw it as there where other cars on the road.;33.2125;-82.3829
