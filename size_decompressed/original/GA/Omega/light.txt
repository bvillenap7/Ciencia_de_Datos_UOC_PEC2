Reflection of tower light seen over field in rural Georgia.;2011-04-24 22:30:00;1 minute;Reflection of tower light seen over field in rural Georgia. In April of 2011, I was driving home on the Omega-Ellenton road near Omega, Georgia, when I looked up and saw what I thought at first was a shooting star.  However, it left no trail and the edges of the light twinkled as the craft ran a long curve downwards and parallel to the velocity of my truck.  After following the object with my eyes for a mile or so, I saw where the source of the light was coming from.   A nearby cell tower was producing light of the exact same hue and color.  I came to the conclusion that the flying object was reflecting the light from the tower rather than producing its own light.  When a line of thick trees began to build by the road, I lost the object and when I came out on the other side of the grove of woods it was gone.  It was suggested that maybe it was a plane landing in Albany however, no such aircraft could be spotted from 55 miles away, the location of Albany relative to Omega.
