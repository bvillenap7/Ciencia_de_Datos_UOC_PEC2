Fireball that vaporized?;2012-11-11 07:00:00;~1 minute;Fireball that vaporized? Driving on Old Pendgrass Road, crossing over Hwy 129 towards children's school.  Object appeared to be a very bright yellow fireball, shaped like a crescent moon.   As it descended lower, object rapidly decreased in size and turned blue.  It eventually disappeared into the air.   My children ages 9, 6, & 6 would love to know what this was.;34.1151;-83.5748999999999
