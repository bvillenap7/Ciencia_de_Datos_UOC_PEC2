Weird shaped object seperated by a single black pipe connection.;2012-12-12 16:30:00;10;Weird shaped object seperated by a single black pipe connection I was leaving Athens after the death of a family member at a local hospital last night about 4:30pm.  As I was traveling up 129 back twards gainesville were I live.  I saw this large object which I though was a helicopter with carrying something.  As it crossed the rd It looked like a hammer top with the teeth end forward and then at the bottom was a upside down peace that looked like a hammer top with the teeth end in the same direction but pointing up.  They were seperated by a single tube looking object.  They were silver in color but the peace conecting them was black.  I was about a quarter mile away from the object that was large in size.  When I got a good look at it it looked like something from a movie.  I have been in the military for 6years and never saw anything like it.  I came across this site while googleing the event to see if anyone else saw it.  I saw anouther simular siting on the site from last year in jefferson.  It had no sound and was ! in laming terms very interesting.  It was deff not anything that anyone has ever seen flying in the sky befor.  It was a cloudy day and it was very low in sky maby a few thousand feet above the ground.  It diaapered behind a high bank that was beside the rd and disapered behind Jefferson High school.;34.1151;-83.5748999999999
Bunches of lights like stars moving slow and fast and staying in the same spot but swaying or spinning for over a hour.;2015-09-19 01:30:00;>1 hour;Bunches of lights like stars moving slow and fast and staying in the same spot but swaying or spinning for over a hour. It was a little after one in the morning 9/19/15.  I went to take the dog out and I look up and looks like bunches of stars more then I ever seen in the sky.   Then I seen  some move slowly and take off really fast but not go far.   So I called my wife from in the house and she looks at them and some would move or looked like they was swaying or spinning but there was no noise and we watched for over a hour getting attacked by mosquitos just wanted to watch bc it was so amazing and its like they knew we was watching them;34.1151;-83.5748999999999
