I TURN TO MY RIGHT AFTER A LIGHTNING STRIKE, AND I SEE AN OBJECT FLYING INTO THE STORM CLOUD.  THEN ABOUT 5 SECONDS LATER, IT WENT BACKWARDS OUT OF THE CLOUD.   IT HAD 2 SECTIONS.  BOTH WERE SILVER & EGG SHAPED.  BUT THEY WERE NOT THE SAME SIZE.  1 WAS BIG AND THE OTHER WAS HALF THE SIZE.  THEY WERE SEPERATED BY WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS A SHORT BLACK TUBE.   IF THERE ARE OTHERS WHO HAVE SEEN THIS, PLEASE SAY SOMETHING. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Date is approximate.
