bright light changing colors hovering in the sky;2014-10-01 21:00:00;25 minutes;bright light changing colors hovering in the sky I was outside talking to my wife when I noticed a very bright light in the sky to the West. I pointed it out to my wife and she noticed immediately it was not moving.  It Sat in the same spot for 15 minutes.  I went to get our binoculars and could see it was changing from white, blue, green, orange, red.  We called the neighbors and they came out to see it also.;34.1151;-83.5748999999999
South of I-85 near Jefferson, GA, I saw a bright light fall from sky no sound.;2017-04-17 04:56:00;4 seconds;South of I-85 near Jefferson, GA, I saw a bright light fall from sky no sound. While driving south on I-85, I saw a bright light fall from the sky to my left (south).  It was the about the same brightness as a helicopter running light.   It went down behind the tree and I really expected to see an explosion and fire, but nothing.  Maybe this was a meteor?;34.1151;-83.5748999999999
Strange flashing light, no rhythm, and wildly varying intensity, moving west to east.;2017-07-09 04:30:00;5 minutes;Strange flashing light, no rhythm, and wildly varying intensity, moving west to east. I went out to have a smoke at around 4:30 AM.  I do this often, and am always looking up for shooting stars, satellites, etc.  I saw a slightly yellowish/white light in the Western sky flash dimly then go out.   I kept watching the same area of the sky, and several seconds later, the light appeared again, but about 5 times as bright, and the light stayed on for at least 3 seconds, and had moved some distance toward the east.   It then flashed dimly several seconds later, then again dimly, then very brightly and for a longer duration.  There was no rhythm to this flashing at all, it was very random, and definitely was not a plane.  I’ve seen many satellites, and this was very different.  For one, it was much slower, and secondly, on a strange west to east path, thirdly, satellites don’t flash.  The strangest thing though, I went out the very next night, and saw the exact same object, same trajectory, only slightly further south in the sky.   I don’t know what it was, but it was definitely unidentified by this long time sky watcher.;34.1151;-83.5748999999999
