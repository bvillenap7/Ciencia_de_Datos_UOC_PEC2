Small submarine like structure spotted;2008-05-05 21:30:00;1 min 30 sec;Small submarine like structure spotted It was around 9:00pm and I went outside, only intending to look for the Little and the Big Dipper, but could hardly see anything because there were clouds covering most of the sky. Before I went back into my house, I spotted a submarine like structure (I donâ€™t know how else to describe it.. it was the same form as a sub but there was a major size difference: it was probably about the size of a small pop-up camper and it was flat, but it was in the shape of a sub.)  There were no lights.  It was darker than the sky. It flew about 10 seconds and then veered west toward the town of Toccoa on highway 17.;34.5701;-83.3091
