Four bright white lights attached to a football shaped glossy black object.;2014-09-18 21:35:00;15 seconds;Four bright white lights attached to a football shaped glossy black object On September 18, 2014, around 9:35pm my friend and I were traveling on Hwy 25 south.  On Hwy 25 about four miles outside of Millen, Georgia city limits I notice something out of the corner of my sight on the right side.  I look and there was 4 bright white lights spaced apart in a curved downward shape.  The lights were apart of a very large football shaped glossy black object.                                                                                                      I yell to my friend look at that.  An instant fear came over both of us as we watched.  In a time frame of around ten seconds the bright lights turned off one by one starting left to right.   A few seconds after the lights went out the very large football shaped object vanished. it didn't fly off, it vanished into thin are in front of our eyes.                                 At that moment my friend and I both had all the hair stand up on our bodies and goosebumps all over.   Also, I remember after seeing the object vanish I could see the lights of an airplane off in the distance behind it.  After seeing this we turned on the emergency flashers and sped all the way to my house;32.7871;-81.9577
