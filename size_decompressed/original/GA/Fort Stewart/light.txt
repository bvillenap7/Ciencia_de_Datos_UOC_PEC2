ONE UFO OVER TANK RANGE AT FORT STEWART GA.;1988-08-01 00:00:00;20 MINUTES;ONE UFO OVER TANK RANGE AT FORT STEWART GA. I WAS IN THE GEORGIA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD FROM 1984-1997. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT DATE. MY TANK BATALLION WAS OUT AT ONE OF THE LIVE FIRE TANK RANGES FOR LIVE FIRE TRAINING DURING OUR ANNUAL TRAING. I KNOW IT WAS IN AUGUST. IT WAS A VERY CLEAR NIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE THE STARS VERY GOOD. WE WERE PROBALLY 20 MILES FROM THE MAIN POST. SO IT WAS REAL DARK AND WE WERE NOT USING ANY LIGHTS DUE TO LIGHT DISCIPLINE. THE CLOSEST TOWN IS PEMBROKE FROM WHERE WE WERE LOCATED. THERE WAS ABOUT 15 OF US GROUPED TOGETHER AND I LOOKED UP AT THE STARS LOOKING FOR SHOOTING STARS. I SAW A LIGHT THAT APPEARED TO BE AN AIRCRAFT ABOUT 160 DEGREES IN THE SKY. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AIRPLANE. BUT AFTER WATCHING IT FOR A MOMENT IT LOOKED TO BE TO HIGH OF AN ALTITUDE TO BE AN AIRPLANE. ALSO THERE WAS NO NOISE. I BROUGHT THIS OBJECT TO THE ATTENTION OF EVERYONE IN MY IMMEDIATE AREA. WE ALL STARTED WONDERING WHAT THIS OBJECT WAS. IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SHOT 1/2 WAY ACROSS THE SKY IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. WE ALL KNEW IT WAS NOT A WORLDLY CRAFT. IT WAS WAY TO FAST. FOR ABOUT THE NEXT 15 MINUTES WE WATCHED IT ZIG ZAG EVERY 2-3 MINUTES ALL OVER THE SKY. NEVER MAKING A SOUND. IT WAS TO HIGH IN THE SKY TO MAKE OUT ANY KIND OF SHAPE. ALSO IT APPEARED TO HAVE ONLY ONE LIGHT. IT LOOKED LIKE A CONTINUOUS SHOOTING STAR. I DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS OBJECT WAS NEVER REPORTED, AND I HAVE TOLD ALOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT IT. I WAS WATCHING UFO FILES ON TELEVISION TONIGHT AND THEY MENTIONED THIS REPORTING CENTER, SO I FOUND YOUR SITE AND THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE MY SITING.;31.88885;-81.59915
