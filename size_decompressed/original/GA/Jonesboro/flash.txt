All the lights flickered and then they all went out. I was a little worried but i did not think anything of it. I went outside to see if the street lights had gone out as well and i noticed that they had.I began to walk back into the house when i heard a noise that sounded like a train. It was very loud and i thought it was coming from the sky so i looked up and i saw a bright flash of light. It was so intense that i turned away and i remember the sensation of falling.The next thing i knew i was opening my eyes to find the light from the street lamps shining on me. I thought that i had just passed out but when i went back into the house i noticed that it was four o'clock. I do not know what happened but i think i was abducted. There are numerous bruises on my body. Some on my neck but most around my genital area. I also had a powerful urge to piss but i could not.;33.5130130434782;-84.3659
