One lower than the other. Heading south towards Macon ga. Large burning fire ball that left no trail of smoke or debris! Bubbling hot glowing flames like lava! Came to a stable altitude, each one, and started cooling off at the same time maintaining it's current cruising speed until it cooled quickly,less than 30 secs each one and disappeared in the dark minless night sky! They always do this. This is my second time in 5 yrs seeing this! Atlanta hartsfield airport had to pick them up on their radar because they came in directly over the airport! This is my second time reporting but I'm sure even reporting this it won't be covered or explained! I'm sure by the creation of this site you guys know what's going on and probably just gonna make a fool outta the people that report them. There's no way this is happening and it's not being taken seriously unless you guys wanna keep it secret! NOW WTF IS GOING ON?;33.5130130434782;-84.3659
