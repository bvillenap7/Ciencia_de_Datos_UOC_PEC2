Triangle shaped object with round balls towards the ends of each point, viewed over highway 1941, moving towards Atlanta airport.;1996-07-01 17:30:00;2 minutes;Triangle shaped object with round balls towards the ends of each point, viewed over highway 1941, moving towards Atlanta airport. I was traveling home from work around 5:30, going south on 1941.  As I had proceeded south, just before the Southway shopping center, (it was actually above the waffle house, which is now closed) I glanced out my driver window which first seemed to me as a radio tower top but I had noticed the object was free floating.  I was just passing the Happy gas station when I noticed the object and quickly as I could, I traversed my car to the turn around lane adjacent to the waffle house, never trying to take my eyes off the object.  I made a complete stop in the turn around lane, stepped out my car and closely viewed the object. It was triangle shaped, gray in color and each corner had a round ball towards the end of the corner.  I would say about 30 seconds of looking at the object after stepping out of my car I viewed the object move quickly towards the Hartsfield Jackson Airport location.  I specifically remember the object moved reasonably fast but also seemed to almost vanish at times while moving.  When I arrived home I told my girlfriend and mother what I had seen.  Several days later I had told a friend and he told me he heard there had been sightings in the Fayette county area on the same day.  This happened 22 years ago and I will never forget.  Figured it was time I shared my experience.;33.5130130434782;-84.3659
