My family and I (the four of us) we're at the Buggs concert in the park and I looked up to see several pinpoints of light flying through the sky at different angles and speeds.  I asked the rest of my family if they were seeing them too and they all said they could.  It looked almost as if some of the stars had come to life and were parading around in the sky putting on a show.  We would see them come in and out of focus, blink occasionally, disappear and reappear.  These tiny light points came at different times in different locations all over the sky above us.  I hadn't seen any in a while, so it was quite an enjoyable experience for me.  It continued until we left the concert, and maybe for longer, but we watched them fly across the sky for at least 30 minutes before we left.;33.5130130434782;-84.3659
