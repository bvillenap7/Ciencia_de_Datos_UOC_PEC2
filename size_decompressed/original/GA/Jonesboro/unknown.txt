Bright moving satellite;2004-04-25 21:00:00;30 sec;Bright moving satellite while walking back to the house from the driveway,just happened to look up at the sky. My eyes became fixed on a bright star,while i was walking. Then it dawned on me that the star was moving.I stopped and watched the object move across the clear sky at a very high rate of speed. the objects path was northwest to southeast. I watched the object until it moved out of sight. It could have been a satellite but was not a aircraft. ((initials deleted));33.5130130434782;-84.3659
