It had light behind it as if it was a comet!  Was bright dusty glowing light!  But it was too low to be a comet AND NO IT WASNT AN AIRPLANE!  THE ONLY COMET I COULD DETERMINE THAT MIGHT BE SEEN WITH THE NAKED EYE WAS (SO NEAR) CJ2020.  RE CHECK ME IF IM WRONG! I HAVE NO VIDEO IM SORRY! IT WAS HEADED NORTH OVER JONESBORO COMING FROM THE SOUTH FROM MACON!  OK ATLANTA AIRPORT SHOULD HAVE IT IN RADAR!  IT WASN'T A PLANE!!;33.5130130434782;-84.3659
