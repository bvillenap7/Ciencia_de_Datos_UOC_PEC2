An intense periodic flash of light occurred about every 5 seconds as it passed overhead. I saw no object, heard no sound, and there were no green or red lights. I have no idea what I saw. At 10 PM I went out to the back porch to put back the mat that I had rinsed out earlier in the day. As I carried the mat from the line to the porch I noticed a flash which made the trees and yard apparent - kind of like it does when there is lighting, but it was perfectly clear and I could see the stars. After another flash which I did not see directly happened again I walked around the corner of the house where the porch light wasn't shining and looked up and waited. I saw about 8 more flashes directly, each flash occurring at about 2 palm widths apart. At first I thought it had to be something in orbit but nothing I've seen glints like that. This was an intense flash of light on the landscape. I never thought it was any aircraft since there was no sound or other lights usually seen on wing tips or the tail. Could it have been a lightning bug? I thought no since they usually leave a yellowish trail of light. This was a high intensity flash. I don't know what I saw. Anybody between Jefferson and Athens see anything like this around 10:05 PM on Wed Aug 4?;42.3332;-8.5922
