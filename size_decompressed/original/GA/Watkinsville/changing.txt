Thi;1999-11-27 21:00:00;3 hrs 45 mins;Family  & Friends camping out observed a set of 3 neon lights that came together into 1 bright light with approx. 5 pointed edges.  This UFO constantly changed shape and size and darted to higher altitudes for more than 3 hours. Everything was caught on videotape. At around 9:00pm eastern time, 10 friends and family members were camping out and hunting when 1 of the family members observed 3 small lights (green, orange, blue) that were zig zagging as one. As these lights were moving they eventually came together and changed into a small shape that was a circle at one end and star shaped at the other end. The craft appeared to come towards us extremely fast as a huge rainbow colored ball that was spinning extremely fast. While closer to us, it changed back into the star shape very bright light. It was moving so fast and changing into so many shapes that it is difficult to accurately explain what was happening. ((NUFORC Note:  We talked to the witness who has submitted this report, and are satisfied that the events she describes here cannot be ascribed to the optics of her camcorder.  We await the video tape, and will report here what we observe in it.));33.8519000000001;-83.4120000000001
