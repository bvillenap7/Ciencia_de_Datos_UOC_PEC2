This object had no sound, was completely green in color.  It moved slowly across our nighborhood.  We watched it go over and then waited for the sound but there was no sound. The object came from the northeast sky and continued to the southwest sky.  It was going very slow.  It was a darkish lime green color with no flashing lights.  At first we thought it was a jet, but no sound or flashing lights came from this object.  We watched it continue across the sky for approximatley 3 to 4 minutes.  It had a circular shape but could possible be oblong or V shape.  We thought it could possibly be the STEALTH, but we realized that in order for the quietness it would have needed to be going a certain speed.  This was going slower than a normal plane. When looking at the object, we were unsure exactly how large it was, because of the depth of the darkness compared to the shape.  No vibrations, no sound, no humming, nothing but complete silence.  We had children trick or treating in our yard with friends, and our first instinct was to get the children inside.  We were very unsure of what this was.  My husband and I felt that you should know this.  We plan on contacting NASA also.;34.0208;-83.8252
