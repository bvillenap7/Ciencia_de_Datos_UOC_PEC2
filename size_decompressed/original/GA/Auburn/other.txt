It was similar to a laser pointer being moved around. Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be multiple stars and they maintained vertical distance and consistent speed. It was far too slow for a shooting star and far smaller than a typical aircraft light signature. They were not in a straight line. They were consistent in their movement and near the cloud line (at times appeared to be just below, than in the clouds than just slightly in the clouds). As a pilot, I would say they had the same altitude. They were not fast moving, but I can not really estimate how quickly they moved. I have no explanation, but contact AFRCC and they advised me to contact you.;34.0208;-83.8252
