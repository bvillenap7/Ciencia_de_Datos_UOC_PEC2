3 UFO's meet up and fly off as a group.;2014-07-03 22:05:00;5 minutes;3 UFO's meet up and fly off as a group. We saw 2 lights traveling together south to southeast & then moved west.  As the two moved west a third one came in continued with the first two going west until we could not see them any more.  They looked like white balls of light & did not blink like an aircraft.   They were very high in the sky & did not travel in straight flight paths.  They slightly wobbled & were moving faster then any typical airplane flying through the sky.  Both witnesses are ex-military that work directly with aircraft.;34.0208;-83.8252
