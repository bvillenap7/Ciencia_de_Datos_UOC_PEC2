Okay so my cell phone goes off at 6am 4/2/2014I  look out my window and see this triangular shaped object glowing and pulsating and moving slightly up and down.  It hovered about an hour.   I decided to take a pic around 7:00am or so an as it turned daylight it was still there and I took the photo with my camera phone.  If you blow the pic up you can actually see something a right light with a light trail.   It actually moved slowly out of sight and that was about 7:24am.;33.92132;-84.1906743589742
