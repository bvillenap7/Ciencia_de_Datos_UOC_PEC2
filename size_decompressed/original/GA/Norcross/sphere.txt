Several others saw it as well, possibly more from other cross country teams. Beleive it is was a weather balloon, but after about 10 minutes it disappeared, one second it was there then it just wasn't.  Other craft (airplanes) flew by it, leading me to the conclusion that this was a weather balloon.;33.92132;-84.1906743589742
