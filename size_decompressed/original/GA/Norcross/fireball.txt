triangle of lights and fireballs seen heading down Peachtree Industrial Boulevard;2011-04-10 22:00:00;10 minutes;triangle of lights and fireballs seen heading down Peachtree Industrial Boulevard My wife and I were driving down Peachtree Industrial Boulevard heading home towards Lawrenceville.  We saw what appeared to be 4 lights in the sky way ahead of us.  They were in the shape of an isoceles triangle only where there should have been a light at the bottom left, there was none.  The lights slowly dissipated.   We then both saw what to me looked like what you would see if hot air balloons flying at night, but the angle was all wrong, and my wife noted that there was no outline of any balloon against the night sky.  There wasn't.  We watched as they slowly moved across the sky above us.  I pulled over into a mortuary parking lot and we got out of the car to watch them as they moved overhead in a linear direction slowly.  I can't say how fast.  We watched two of them until the first one seemed to burn out until there was only a pinpoint of very dim light floating.  The second light did the same thing, burning out until there was just a pinpoint of ! dim light.  I lost it in the streetlight and was not able to visually aquire it again, after that. Initially, we thought the triangle thing was airplanes in formation waiting to land, but they weren't moving.  Then, after the lights started disappearing, we knew it wasn't airplanes.  The lights were a red color. They looked much further off than the second set of lights we saw. I don't know how the other lights we saw are related to the triangle.;33.92132;-84.1906743589742
Orange Fire Ball Disappears.;2014-08-11 22:45:00;3 seconds;Orange Fire Ball Disappears. I just drove onto Ga 141 @ Peachtree Blvd & just above my car, out the front window, I saw a orange fire ball flying on a path that curved to the left for a few seconds.   Just as it apeared, it just disappeared into nothing.  When it disappeared, it looked like a very minimal distortion of light happened but it happened so fast it was hard to discern.   It has a bit a regtanular shape to it & it was not very high. I want to say it was under 2000 feet.   It was flying in a North East path.;33.92132;-84.1906743589742
