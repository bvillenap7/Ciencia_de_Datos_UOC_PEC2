Fireball looking object during lighting storm;2012-07-10 10:02:00;2 minutes;Fireball looking object during lighting storm I walked out of my house to take my girlfriend home when i noticed a light in the sky.   I thought it was an airplane at first but i got out and ran to get a closer look in my backyard.   As i approach my neighbors are outside and notice as well and we see the fireball looking object dim a bit then light up some more, then the light went out completely but the circular ball was still visible and kept floating behind the trees.  There was a lot of lightning but no rain. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.8907;-84.6999999999999
