Very Bright Blue Star;2003-10-29 19:15:00;15 minutes;I was spending the early evening observing Mars (which was in the SSW) when with the naked eye I saw a very bright blue star directly beneath Mars (about 10 degrees below). I was excited, because I thought it was Jupiter, and I thought This is cool, planets lined up. After about 12 minutes, I was distracted by my cat, and when I looked up again it was gone. I checked the sky and saw nothing like its color or magnitude in any other quadrant. It completely disappeared, after being stationary in the sky for more than 10 minutes.;33.8907;-84.6999999999999
bright light fell from northeast sky, where a circle of lights hovered for 15 minutes;2008-01-24 19:15:00;15 minutes;bright light fell from northeast sky, where a circle of lights hovered for 15 minutes I was teaching my daughter how to drive on Jan 24, 2008 at 7:15 pm. I was in the passenger seat. We stopped at a stop sign facing the southeast sky. I saw a huge bright light “fall” in an arc path from left to right very quickly like a streak.  I thought it was a falling star, so I drove in the direction of where I thought it fell. As I drove toward the area, I reached a clearing in the sky so a good part of the sky was not occluded with trees etc. This was about 2 or 3 minutes after seeing the light.  When I looked up, there was definitely a circle of lights. My mind was thinking “falling star” so I thought they were helicopters that were around where it fell, but as I watched them, they were all in a perfect circle, all completely still and there were at least 6 or 7 lights.   The circle was covering a huge area in the sky.  We continued to drive in the same direction, but we weren’t getting any closer to the area or the circle of lights, so we went home. I called the local news station to see if anyone else had reported something, or if an aircraft had gone down.  The person who answered the phone said I was the second person to call, but then I never heard anything else about it.  This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.;33.8907;-84.6999999999999
