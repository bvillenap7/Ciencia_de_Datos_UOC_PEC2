Bright Sphere of light witnessed by five in Powder Springs, Ga.;2020-08-07 22:14:00;~15 minutes;Bright Sphere of light witnessed by five in Powder Springs, Ga. I, personally, was not involved. The witnesses were my father, his cousin(C), his sister(W) and her daughter(E), and my mother.  All of whom I trust in their testimony whole heartedly. This describtion is directly as W explained to me. E had been seeing weird lights in the pasture all evening.   When we got ready to leave, C asked what's that weird light in the garden.I(W) turned to look but he(C) said it's gone.  I(W) said, well,I'll take a picture and see if we get anything...,the garden was pitch black, no lights.  When my(W) phone camera lit up, you could see this big ball of SUPER bright light sitting on the ground.  I(W) never saw it shoot up, it must have done that just as the picture snapped. Faster than lightening!!!!!;33.8907;-84.6999999999999
