Drove from house to our workshop (approx. 500ft) to start a fire.  Saw 3 bright red lights moving relatively slowely, heading south (close to I-75).  2 of the red lights were close to each other, while the 3rd red light trailed at some distance.  I jumped out of the truck & pulled out my phone & began recording simultaniousely telling my girlfriend to look at the sky.  At that time the trailing 3rd light zoomed up to the first 2 lights, which created a perfect triangle.  She started freaking out, so we went back up to the house.  I ran to tell my dad & we went back outside, but the lights were gone (approx. 2 minutes after first sighting).  I pulled my phone out to show the video but nothing was recorded.  We didn't actually see any type of saucer or craft, just bright red lights that each seemed to be an individual craft.;33.2871;-83.9838
