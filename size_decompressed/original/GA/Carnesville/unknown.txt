Very fast half-moon object over Georgia;2004-01-11 17:10:00;20 seconds;Very fast half-moon object over Georgia I filed a report from this same local last month. The report was of 20+ objects circling one another in a funnel until they disappeared into the atmosphere.  Well, again today I was outside on the trampoline with my two sons. We like to watch the planes as they pass over from time to time. We saw am airliner coming south (toward Atlanta) leaving a condensation trail. As we watched it, a craft came out of the west heading east and passed over us. It was white and I was able to discern that it had no wings and was sort of half-moon shaped. What struck me was the speed of this object. In the 20 seconds I observed it went from one horizon to the other and out of sight. The airliner wasn't even over our heads by the time this thing was gone. It made no sound and left no trail.  I couldn't tell how high it was. It was a good distance up, but not as high as the airliner.  A couple of minutes later we saw a jet or two fly over. They were going faster than the airliner, but couldn't hold a candle to the speed the UFO displayed. They were also leaving condensation trails (not chem-trails).  Overall the speed, shape, silence, and no trail made this object stick out like a sore thumb to me. Again I was in no position to run inside the house and retrieve my video camera. I think I'll make a habit of taking it outside with me from now on.  P.S. I called the local newspapers and law enforcement and was told that no one reported anything like what we saw last month.;34.3654;-83.2556
