Comet-like object moving across sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));2007-12-10 19:30:00;1 hour;Comet-like object moving across sky Total observation time: Approx. 1 hour, from 19:30 to 20:30 EST.  Object description:  To the naked eye, appeared as a gray hazy patch, mostly circular but flattened on one side. Approximate magnitude 1 to 2 at initial sighting, approximate size ¾ degree across.  Through binoculars (10x50) & telescope (6” F5 reflector) was shaped very much like a water fountain spraying straight up (or a mushroom cloud, pointed at the base). Through the telescope I noticed a point-source of light traveling with the cloud, near the tip, or base.  This point-source varied up and down in magnitude slowly, averaging around 5th magnitude, but every so often (between 10 and 60 seconds or so) it would flare to perhaps –2 magnitude, instantaneously, as if sunlight were reflecting from a flat surface, as is observed with tumbling satellites.  Movement was in a straight line. At initial sighting this was approximately 3/4 degree per minute. Object speed slowed as it progressed across the sky, indicating to me that it was traveling in a straight line, as opposed to orbiting Earth. The brightness of the cloud diminished as well, though more rapidly than the point-source.  At the end of the observation the cloud was no longer visible, only the point-source, which by this time had faded to average magnitude of 10 to 11, still flaring to magnitude 4 or so. Movement had slowed to about 120 arc seconds per 10 seconds.  To summarize, object was first sighted in Cassiopeia, approx Alt. 65 degrees, Az. 5 degrees (R.A. 0h10m x Dec. 55 deg.). After approximately one hour, final sighting was in Lynx at approx Alt. 40 degrees, Az. 60 (R.A. 6h40m x Dec. 55 deg.) Object traversed approx 55 degrees.  I have sketched the view through the telescope, indicating the location of the point-source of light, the direction of travel, and the direction of North. I will e-mail the sketch.  Also I took several photos with a 35mm SLR, ranging from 30 to 60 seconds each on ISO 200 film. When I get it developed I will send those pictures. The film had been in the camera for a long time, hopefully the pictures will come out okay. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));34.3654;-83.2556
