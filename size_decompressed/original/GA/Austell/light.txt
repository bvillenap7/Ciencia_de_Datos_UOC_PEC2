Bright object in sw sky of austell, ga;2003-12-17 19:05:00;45 mins;Bright object in sw sky of austell, ga I just came home from the movies and I noticed this bright light located about SW to my apartment complex.  At best some one would describe it as a bright star or a commercial plane coming towards you.  There is considerable aircraft traffic where I live and usally you can see objects such as these that turn out to be planes.  Here's the problem the object never moved or a least seem to stay in the same place for a least 45 mins.  When I first saw the object it seem to have a solid white light to it.  As the time pass by the color seem to change to an orange red, but still keeping it's intensity.  I would have to say it was 20 to 25 feet above my visual horizon, but keep in mind the light was some distance away from me.  Towards the end the object seem to get lower and eventually went below my visual horizon.  One more thing, the light seem to move from side to side.  But it could have been my eyes playing a trick on me...  Did anybody else see this???;33.8018133333333;-84.6097366666667
very bright non moving light.;2013-11-08 19:00:00;6 minutes;very bright non moving light Around 7:30 this evening my Son and I arrived home from grocery shopping.  Upon getting out of the car I happened to look up and see a very big bright light in the sky..  I cant really describe the shape, it was just so bright.  And way to big to be a star.   I watched it for a couple of minutes got creeped out and went inside.  About 2 min later I went back out to the car to grab another bag and noticed it was no longer there.  This all took place in less than 10 minutes.;33.8018133333333;-84.6097366666667
One bright green light (similar to traffic light green) moving straight downwards at a fast, but controlled rate of speed. No contrails;2016-09-22 21:30:00;20 seconds;One bright green light (similar to traffic light green) moving straight downwards at a fast, but controlled rate of speed.  No contrails or blurring.   Multiple aircraft arrived soon after. Slower than a shooting star, but faster than any commercial aircraft.   Lost sight of it as it continued downwards beyond that tree line.;33.8018133333333;-84.6097366666667
