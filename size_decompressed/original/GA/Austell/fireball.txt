Bright light falling to earth.;2014-09-23 21:25:00;5 seconds;Bright light falling to earth. I was driving west on I-20 when a very bright light began falling from the sky.  It fell fast and was very bright.  When the natural moment of impact should have taken place, all of the drivers on the interstate hit their brakes at the same time.   The light, as it got to its brightest, disappeared right before it would've hit the ground.;33.8018133333333;-84.6097366666667
