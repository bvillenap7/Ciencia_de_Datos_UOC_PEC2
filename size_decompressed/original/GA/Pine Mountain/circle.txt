Strange sighting of soft orange light.;2015-10-10 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Strange sighting of soft orange light. During a family camping trip to Pine Mountain for my kids dally break we all were sitting around the fire roasting marshmallows and talking when my mother inlaw pointed out an object that appeared at first to be a plane on fire it was flying above the tree tops and not losing altitude but was gaining speed.  I listen to try and hear something but nothing came of it, so I watched as it disappeared over the tree tops headed straight toward Columbus, GA.  The next day I searched to see if I could find anything about a plane crash, but all I found were reports of the same thing being spotted all over the east coast from Michigan to Florida.;32.8722;-84.8985
