Bright spotlight looking object slowly moving across the sky;2020-06-13 05:27:00;5 minutes;Bright spotlight looking object slowly moving across the sky I turned left onto Mt.Laurel dr. As soon as I turned on the road up on the left side of the rd I saw a bright light that kinda looked like a spotlight shining down. I drove about 700 feet down and stopped and took a couple of pictures. At first I thought it was stationary but as I sat still watching it I realized it was moving across the sky slowly.  At this point I changed from picture to video. Not a great video but if you look close on the steady parts you can tell it is moving. About half way through I kinda felt like I was exposed as my headlights was on in all this darkness so i turned them off. This is where you can really see how it is moving.I videoed it till it went behind some trees. I kept filming because I could still see some light behind the trees hoping it would become visible again. I realized it would not so I drove around the curve in the rd to get a better shot behind this set of trees but it was completely gone. No lights or anything any! where. As slow as it seemed to be traveling I should have saw it again around the curve or down the road some. Never saw anymore light or anything.;32.8722;-84.8985
