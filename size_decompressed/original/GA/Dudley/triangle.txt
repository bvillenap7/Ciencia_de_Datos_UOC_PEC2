Amber colored lights, dropped straight down to tree top altitude triangle in shape Laurens County, Georgia;2014-03-26 20:45:00;2-5 minutes;Amber colored lights, dropped straight down to tree top altitude Triangle in shape Laurens County, Georgia. I was heading home to Dublin, Ga, from Cochran, Ga, on the evening of 3/26/2014 at approximately 8:45 PM.   I noticed directly in front of my car a blinking amber series of lights.  These lights appeared to be dropping very rapidly in altitude and I thought that they may be a series of meteors.   These lights took on a triangle shape and leveled off at what seemed to be tree-top level.   These lights were distinctly craft shape and I thought that they may be large cargo planes headed to Robins Air Force Base.  I have seen large cargo planes like the C-130 heading on this flight path many times, but never this low or with lights only amber in color.   It appeared that there was at least two crafts which leveled off and accelerated at a very rapid pace, which seemed impossible for any cargo plane I have ever seen.   I have three other people who saw these same crafts at the same date and time from different parts of town.;32.5283;-83.093
