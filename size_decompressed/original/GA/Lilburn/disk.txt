I noticed shadows from the trees moving closer to me, I smelled somthing similer to electricity and heard small popping noises.  I looked up and and saw a small circuler object directly above me, it did not stay exactly the same shape all the time.  It followed me as i backed into the woods to gain cover.  I noticed I was deeper into the woods than I realized, I think I lost a little time.  I became very scaed and ran directly towards the streetlights.  When I emerged onto the road I was a half mile away from the trail entrance.  I ran home w/out looking up or back.  I have never told anyone.
