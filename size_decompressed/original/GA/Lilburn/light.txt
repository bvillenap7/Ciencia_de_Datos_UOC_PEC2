At approximately 6:30 PM EST (local dusk), a bright orange/yellow light was observed travelling slowly E/ESE, and gave the appearance of heading toward the observers. The light was seen while motoring west on U.S. highway 78 approximately 2 miles east of Stone Mountain Park, GA. This area is a densely populated suburb of Atlanta, GA. The local temperature was approximately 38 degrees F with clear cloudless skies and a brisk wind from the north. The light was approximately 20-25 degrees above the local horizon, was mostly circular and yellowish at its center fading to orange at its perimeter. It had no noticeable irregularities in shape, had no visible tail or contrail, was approximately 4-6 times the diameter and brightness of the brightest star, and was visible for approximately 15 seconds prior to its sudden and silent explosion. Upon exploding, the object split into two fiery fragments which rapidly descended toward the ground. Smoke was visible around the area of the original object and behind the descending fragments. The smoke appeared dark against the dusk sky and expanded in an irregular inverted triangular pattern. The two fragments descended southward toward a line of trees and disappeared from sight prior to reaching the horizon. This event was observed by one adult female and two adolescent male children. Many other motorist were traveling along the same route and appeared to slow down to observe the event.;33.852;-84.1152000000001
