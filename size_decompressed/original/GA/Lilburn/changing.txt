Driving to a restaurant we saw a cluster of what looked like very bright stars moving slowly.  They were out of sight until we got to the parking lot.  The lights were now in a straight line expanding to approximately 20 lights, some red and some white/yellow. The lights were still moving northwest of where we were.  Three of us went inside to eat and the other stayed out to have a cigarette.  When she came inside she claims to have seen multiple airplanes fly towards the direction the lights were traveling. When we got out of the restaurant, a star filled sky seemed almost empty, like smoke or fog was covering it.  The stars and the line of lights seemed very faint.  It wasn't clouds covering the sky because we could see the very few clouds that were there in the horizon. When I got home I heard multiple airplanes and helicopters flying fairly close to the ground.  I went on Facebook and saw the status updates from multiple people saying things like does anybody else see what I'm seeing  or what are those lights in the sky??   I wanted to go back out and check it out, but I didn't.;33.852;-84.1152000000001
