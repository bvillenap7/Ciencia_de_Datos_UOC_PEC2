soft-white glowball;2004-10-03 03:00:00;5 seconds;I previously emailed you about my experience when I was 12 in Centerville, Ohio, in 1973..you should have that on record already.  I briefly mentioned at that time the experience on 10/3/04.  First, it is important that you know that the experiences I have had over the past 31 years since the initial event in 1973 have been in a dream-like state.  Not deep sleep, but a dozing off state.  The older I get the more aware of these visits I am aware of.  The last one happened on 10/3/04 in a light dozing at 3:00 am.  I saw in a vision/dream whatever you want to call it, a light appear in the trees in my backyard.  I levitated up to it, was paralyzed for about 5 seconds, got back in my body and was aware at this time.  My body was cold and shaking.  I closed my eyes, and saw an afteraffect of a light in my eyes while closed.  (Look at a light for awhile, and close your eyes, you will see the afteraffect of that light.)  It was 3 am, no lights in the room for at least 5 hours.  DARK.  Then this happened.  The light afteraffects were in my closed eyes for about 30 minutes.  What happened was real because you do not see afteraffects of a light in the dark.  What I think the UFO phenomonem is about is dimensional.  PLEASE FIGURE THIS OUT.  DIMENSIONAL.  Every scientist out there is looking out in the sky when it is here in our own backyard.  It has been 31 years for me.  My life, a nobody, a somebody to some, is telling you that the UFO you want to find is dimensional.  You may see a craft in the sky, you may see crop circles, you may see things unexplained, but the REAL essence of the UFO is in the soft-white glowball that enters the body and returns for whatever experimental means it wants through a dream-like, subconcious state.  Please have an investigator call me.  Thank you.;33.852;-84.1152000000001
A fireball or ring streaked the sky to the north of Lilburn, GA lasting less than 2 seconds.;2020-11-01 20:00:00;00:00:01;A fireball or ring streaked the sky to the north of Lilburn, GA lasting less than 2 seconds. My husband and I were driving west southwest. The bright ring of light appeared towards our right making it to our north. It started about two tree heights above the tree line and descended rapidly at about a 15 to 20 degree slant from vertical  from our perspective.  It appeared quickly as a flash of brilliant white which changed to a bright white-green and I saw a little blue. It left a trail of bright green behind it that faded to white  quickly before disappearing. The whole incident was over within 2 seconds. No sound was associated with this bright meteor (if that is what it was).  My husband reported that he thought it was more of a ring than a ball. I couldn't verify the exact shape seeing that I was driving.;33.852;-84.1152000000001
