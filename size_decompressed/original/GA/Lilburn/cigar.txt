The end of the wings pointed upward and there were two very small engines on tail.  It was moving very slowly directly in front of my car and seemed very low for its size.  No noise but I was inside my car with windows rolled up.   The way it was flying was very strange because the wings were moving in a way that looked like it was floating.  I suspect it was some sort of drone but I am unsure.;33.852;-84.1152000000001
