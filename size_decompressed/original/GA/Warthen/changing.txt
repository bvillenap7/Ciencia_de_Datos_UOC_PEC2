I was driving along South Sparta-Davisboro Road, and suddenly about 5-6  bright lights appeared above many pine trees.  These lights were moving in an southeastly direction.  They appeared to be flying in some type of formation.  The light were very bright and flew at medium altitutde.  Once I thought that the lights were coming in the direction that I drove in.  At this time, I began to get scared and panicky.  I began to stop my car and the lights appeared at a stand-still in the sky.  At this time, I saw at least 4 to 5 lights and they appeared to have a battle.  I did not hear any sound.  These lights appeared to be shooting at each other.   After each light launch some type of explosive at the other, all the light simply disappeared before my eyes.  I have never seen them again.  Days later, I experienced swelling in my ankles and at times my voice echoed when I talked. ((NUFORC Note:  If the lights were not associated with an advertising display, then we don't know what the witness observed.  PD));33.123;-82.8056
