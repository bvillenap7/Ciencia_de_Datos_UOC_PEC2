I believe that it is some secret government military craft of some sort.  Or maybe just sometime that God is trying to tell or show me.;2010-11-17 18:50:00;4 minutes;At approximately 6:50 pm Eastern, I was in my driveway and was distracted by a bright light in the Southeastern skyline.  The one large yellow light suddenly became 2 large yellow lights in the sky parralel to one another quite a distance from each other.  Suddenly, the 2 lights disappeared and just as suddenly, 1 large yellow light appeared further to the left on the same level as the other 2 were.  And just as soon, 2 large yellow lights appeared together on the same level in the area where I had seen the first one.  They were stacked one above the other.  There were now 3 lights visible.  Then the farthest left disappeared and immediately showed up somewhat closer to the other 2.  They all disappeared and a split second later, the 2 that were stacked, re-appeared.  They soon disappeared and I no longer saw them. This is the third such encounter that my wife and I have seen in this area in 2 years.  There is no sound associated with these encounters and they never last more than a few minutes.  I am not a believer in space aliens but I cannot wrap my hands around what I have seen.  I believe that it is some secret government military craft of some sort.  Or maybe just sometime that God is trying to tell or show me.;33.123;-82.8056
