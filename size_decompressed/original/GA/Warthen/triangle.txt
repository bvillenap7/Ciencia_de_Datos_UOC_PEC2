I filed a report on last week.  I recently revealed my sighting to a neigbor and he reported seeing the same thing around the same time period.  He states that the craft acted as if it was going to cross the road and did not.  Instead it increased its altitude from just above the tree line to an increase of about 2000 feet in a blink of an eye.  He also said that one of the lights had streaks coming from it, and with in minutes they all disappeared and the sky became darker in a matter of seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
