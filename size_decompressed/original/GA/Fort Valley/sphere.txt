White ball of multicolored lights left 2 foot circle burned in grass;1979-08-01 00:00:00;10 minutes;White ball of multicolored lights left 2 foot circle burned in grass At the age of 5 or 6, while lying in my bed (near the meeting of highway 41 and state route 96) a star appeared to be coming closer. It was at first white, but upon arriving outside my bedroom window different colored lights were visible. It was a perfect sphere with a window and two heads visible (albeit slightly obscured by the bright light in the middle of the night - they did have eyes, but I don't remember anything else) looking out the window at me. They proceeded to speak to me, though there was no way I should logically have been able to hear them. They were calming and reassuring. I was not nervous at all. I wanted to go outside and see them, but before I could think that far they jetted into the starry sky and disappeared. At that young age I thought they must be angels and was afraid to tell anyone about my experience. The next morning I awoke and assumed it was all a dream. However, while playing outside I found a circular burn mark about 2 feet wide next to my window. The grass was burned in a perfect circle that oddly lasted for several years. I returned there about 5 years ago and the circle was gone. Thank you for listening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));32.5484;-83.8852
