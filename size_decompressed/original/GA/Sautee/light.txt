13 Red and White Flashing Lights in formation.;2017-12-09 20:03:00;3-5 minutes;13 Red and White Flashing Lights in formation. At 8:00pm on Dec 9th, 2017, I witnessed numerous red and white flashing lights coming over the mountain tops.  It looked like they were in formation and the event last around 5 minutes.  The lights were moving north west at that time at a steady pace.  I did notice a plane fly above them, maybe 5000 ft above them.  But my depth perception of these objects was not good though.   I tried to film a video on my phone and still have it but for some reason the lights do not appear.  I think you could make a case that this was a military event, however our rural area was out of power at this time and I didn't hear a sound while these objects were flying over.  That was very strange to me.  I didn't have any sense of fear, mostly just one of wonder.   Very cool experience. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  The sighting occurred at night, so we have corrected the time above.
