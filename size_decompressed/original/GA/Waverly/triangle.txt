Tonight when mom and I were driving home from Savannah Georgia to Kingsland Georgia we noticed a large red ball of fire or triangle shaped with a tail I’m not sure exactly what we saw I know for sure that it was not an airplane it was very visible to me and my mom who’s just had Lasix surgery and has 2020 vision.  We both saw this large red mass in the sky east of I 95 going east and seemingly further up into the sky I pulled off of the highway at exit 26 Dover Bluff and it disappeared completely the entire event lasted about a minute we were both trying to figure out what we had seen.  I know for sure that I have no idea what it was that we both saw it and it was real and it completely disappeared in a very clear sky.;31.0397;-81.5721
