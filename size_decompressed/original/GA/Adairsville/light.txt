Felt something watching me, as I went to get something from my truck.  Looked up to see a bright light with four points of light coming off of it quickly dim into a red/orange ember type light and completely disappear, only to reappear as a bright light in the same spot.  Then it slowly made its way across the sky before slowly fading to the ember and disappearing by getting smaller and smaller.  Moved in a wavering pattern stopping and starting again as well as moving in a wave like pattern.   A smaller light was traveling around it and looked to be farther away like maybe a data light and it made a verticle flight path before disappearing behind trees whereas the brighter light was traveling horizontally.  Smaller light did not change colors.;34.3599;-84.9194
