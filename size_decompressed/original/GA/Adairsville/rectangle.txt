There are always amber Street lights and billboard lights visible, but we'd never seen a light like this before, nor in that area or at the height at which we viewed it. We saw what appeared to be a bar of red light. I could see individual lights made up the bar, but my cell phone camera didn't quite catch it with enough clarity to see this. I stared at it for a solid minute before I watched it fade, one light at a time, from my left to the last light on the right, before completely disappearing. When I returned home that afternoon, I looked to see if any buildings, signs, etc matched the height of the object in that direction, and I couldn't see anything but trees.;34.3599;-84.9194
