Me, my father, and my younger brother saw a intensly bright white light in the night sky. I ran and got my binoculors when I looked through the binoculors there where four lights when I looked at with just my eyes there was only one light. So I am guessing there were four lights on the object spaceed close together.I am going to say it was about a third to a full mile away or more. This is a very rough estimation of how far away it was. It was the brightest object in the sky even brighter then the star sirus. I also counted six to seven airplanes flying by it. Then it very slowley deceded down behind the trees so I dont know if it landed or not.I said it lasted ten to thirty minutes, but it is hard to guess how long it lasted when something like that is happing.

While looking out of an upstairs open window, directly to the south, I observed three lights in an echelon formation.  They were pointed directly toward me at a height of appx 50' and a distance from me of appx 150 yards.  They were on the other side of a border of tall pines on the edge of an open field.  They  either had to go up and over the pines to continue advancing toward me or turn.  The lights  on each craft were like two car head lights placed together.  I say on each craft because as I observed them, they each  in succession turned off to the west.  The lights were not extremely bright, nor were they a focused light.  As I said, the window was open and there was no sound or noise associated with the UFO's. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
