2 bright circular lights seen hovering at dusk in Barrow County, Georgia (Second sighting in 1 week) ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2010-03-19 20:05:00;20 minutes;2 bright circular lights seen hovering at dusk in Barrow County, Georgia (Second sighting in 1 week) Driving West at dusk on Highway 316 we noticed a bright white light hovering low in the sky (same object as report filed on 3/15/10).  Stopped car to take a picture and look through binoculars and then continued driving on 316 toward the light. It appeared to travel slowly northwest. We then noticed a second light to the South that was identical to the first and it seemed to fade and disappear.  They both seemed to flicker and occasionally change to red and then back to white. We will email photos to the address given below. ((NUFORC Note:  The photo indicates a bright, star-like object near the setting Sun.  We suspect that the object is Venus, which is quite prominent in the western sky at dusk, currently.  PD));33.9616;-83.5866
