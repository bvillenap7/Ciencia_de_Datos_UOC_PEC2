Black triangle moving slow with 4 bright lights on back and no noise;2006-03-13 23:15:00;5 Min;Black triangle moving slow with 4 bright lights on back and no noise I seen 2 bright lights as I was traveling down hwy 11 going home and thought that a plane was really low. Then I noticed that it was not moving very fast. As I got further down the road I was coming along the side of it. Once I got to the side of it I noticed it was moving very slow and I heard no noise. I could see an outline of a black triangle shape. There was alot of moon light out. It started to turn and as it turned there where 4 bright lights on the back. It was still moving slowly. I slowed to about 5 mph and watched it moving and then turned around to go the same direction it was moving. As I turned around it started moving up into the sky but the body of the craft stayed horizontal. That was the coolest thing I have ever seen.;34.9739;-85.4301
