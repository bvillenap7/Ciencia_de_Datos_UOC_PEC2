I quicky paid my bill and exited the building hoping to find some Anbesol in my glove box to help with the tooth ache. I got about half way to my car when I noticed that the tooth ache was subsiding. At the same time I noticed that a faint humming sound in my ear. I don't know what made me do this, but I looked up at the sky, to the northwest I believe, and noticed a tight formation of 5 aircraft. At first I dismissed them as military planes doing training maneuvers. But as I continued to watch them, they did some pretty remarkable things. The three that were closest to me (5 miles?) suddenly descended from about 25000 feet to about 500 feet.  The other 2 craft, in the rear, simply disappeared. A bright beam began to shine down from one of them. That is when I blacked out. I came to about 30 minutes later in a farm field 10 miles away. I felt refreshed. (I still had my receipt from the Waffle House in my pocket. The time on the reciept showed what time I had left the resturaunt.) What happened during that 30 minute period is beyond me. I can't remember a thing. Anyway, I found a nearby road and was luckey to find a farm house with a light on inside. The farmer gave me a ride back to my car. It was then that I noticed the my tooth was missing. The strange thing was that there was no blood. It had completely healed over as if I had never been born with a tooth there in the first place. This is what prompted me to visit your website. Looking at my arms and legs, I notice nothing unusual except that there appears to be some kind of injection mark with a lump about the size of a pea on my left bicep. It doesn't hurt and it seems hard. My vision seems a little blurred. In the back pocket of my jeans, I noticed a piece of paper that has a type of hieroglyphics. One last thing to note, the farmer said that he saw a bright light about 5 minutes before I knocked on his door. He said that it was probably lightning though. I asked him if he had heard if there was any thunder, He said no. ((NUFORC Note:  We were somewhat surprised to learn that there is, indeed, a Roswell, GA.  It is straight north of Atlanta, and northeast of Marietta.  We will try to get this case to a MUFON  investigator there.  PD));34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426

Crowd of people walking as I pointed everyone said that has to be something people will report.  When we approache our car, the objects in the sky were gone.  The sky was a fairly clear sky and the orange round objects were in an exact formation.;34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426
