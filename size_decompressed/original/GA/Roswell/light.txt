It was within view between two trees, then it disappeared. This is about when I got a bit startled. A few seconds passed when it reappeared, it looked like a twinkling star this time, except it was changing colors rapidly, and it looked like it was completely at random. By this point I was thoroughly freaked out, so I sat back down on the couch to watch TV. After 30 or so minutes I got up and looked out the window again, the twinkling light was gone. I would also like to note that I have been seeing UFOs and such almost every day here in the Marietta/Roswell GA Area.;34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426
Pale blue light streak across windshield in Roswell 11/02/08.;2008-11-02 23:03:00;2 seconds;Pale blue light streak across windshield in Roswell 11/02/08. I was driving down Hardscrabble road nearby the intersection with Chaffin going due west.  At the top of the windshield appeared a streak of light which I originally registered as a shooting star.  It was a pale blue green light fairly bright, consistant with perhaps a trail from a firework, but without any smoke.  It streaked across my vision from the top of the windshield straight due west and possibly down and escaped my vision behind some trees.  It was going far to fast to be an airplane, and it was not a reflection since I have driven that road many times at night and never witnessed the same phenomenon.  The only logical explanation I could come up with was perhaps a firework remain, but I didn't see smoke and it was an unlikely day and time.   I tried to turn down the radio to hear anything but it was probably too late.  The one thing I did notice was a slight increase in static on the radio which grabbed my attention before I saw the object. ADDENDUM TO REPORT: Correction to previous post.  It was pale in comparison to the lights of the street. However then again, there were no stars visible and it was much brighter and larger than any shooting star I have seen. Also since it was dark and I'm slightly nearsighted it was difficult to tell whether it was moving parallel to the ground  or downwardly. There was also no clouds that night at the temperature was about 14 degrees Celsius.;34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426
Bright flashing lights in pattern formation with one bright light zooming off.;2014-05-14 21:45:00;3-5 minutes;Bright flashing lights in pattern formation with one bright light zooming off. I was on my way back from the movies when my sister and I pulled into our neighborhood.  Nearing our cul-de-sac I noticed multiple lights flashing one after another over the tree line. It seemed to be a circular shape.  It slowly moved out of sight.   Then, after continuing to look in the sky I noticed what looked like a similar light (same brightness and shape) burst off into the sky and disappeared.
