I always sit outside every morning.  This morning the birds got quiet as a sound got very loud.  You could literally feel the sound and the light wind went quite.   I grabbed my iPad to snap a picture but nothing could be seen as it was cloudy.  The sound just started above me and went north and south a few times.  Almost as if I could hear it creating a circle above me.  Very different than an airplane or helicopter.  I did take video of an empty sky and it still haunts me as I listen. In the past 4 years I hadnâ€™t heard anything like this.;34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426
