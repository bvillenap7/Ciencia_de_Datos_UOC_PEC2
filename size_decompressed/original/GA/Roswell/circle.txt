When it dropped down it looked like a orange type circle moving across the sky moving swiftly across the sky.  Then disappeared.  There was what looked like a shooting star that was near it.

huge object with glowing lights flies over;2011-06-15 01:00:00;one minute;huge object with glowing lights flies over The time in which I saw the craft was very short. I wad sitting on my couch late one night, and while looking out the window I saw many lights, least four. I know there was definitely red, yellow and possibly green lights. This was unusual because the object was huge and blocked out the sky over the tops of the trees. It was huge and had many lights on it, so I then proceed to run out into the yard to get a better look, but by the time I got there it was going over the side of the house and I could only see a glimpse of it as it passed over.  I'm still confused about what I saw. It was no plane, it was extremely  huge and was not  shaped like a plane.  It was low flying, right over the tops of the trees and it blocked out the sky.  There were many lights coming from it.  I still baffle over what I saw ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426
Firey orange ring on July 4th before sunset in Roswell, GA - could have been seen by hundreds of people.;2012-07-04 18:30:00;3 minutes;Firey orange ring on July 4th before sunset in Roswell, GA - could have been seen by hundreds of people Sitting amongst hundreds of people waiting for the City of Roswell fireworks display to begin.   Sky was partly cloudy.  I was facing North, and a single firey orange, slightly pulsating ring traveled slowly at a steady speed from West to East.   It was partially obscured by light cloud cover, and it began to climb into the clouds where it became then completely obscured after 3 minutes in view.    This could have been seen by hundreds of people, many of whome had cameras to record the upcoming fireworks.   I am a systems/mechanical engineer.  It was creepy.;34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426

Intense white/ blue light  in the sky for only about 5 seconds;2014-08-23 00:00:00;5 seconds;Intense white/ blue light  in the sky for only about 5 seconds Took my dog outside.  Witnessed an intense bright light.  Thought at first I was about to get hit by a lightning strike (the light was so intense).  Incredibly bright, but in a limited area.  It was gone as fast as it appeared.  No sound. No clouds in the sky.  I am 61 and have never seen anything like this.;34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426
