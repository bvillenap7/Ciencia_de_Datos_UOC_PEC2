Atlanta New Years Eve 2010 object.  ((NUFORC Note:  Highly qualified witness.  PD));2010-12-31 23:25:00;3 seconds;Atlanta New Years Eve 2010 object Was looking through my skylight and noticed an object moving across my vision that I though was a meteor but quickly noticed no fire trail and then saw that it was a cylinder object round at each end that was almost a transparent electric blue moving at teh same speed across the sky.  Seemed like it was just in the low hanging cliud cover.  Almost looked like a skylight you might see at a night club  shining into  a low cloud ceiling. I know its New years eve and I can hear the fireworks going off in the surrounding nieghborhoods, but niether before or since have there been any rockets of any kind to be seen in my sky.   I have watched the sky my whole life and can usually tell what something is pretty quick.   I have also lived near Army, Navy, and Air Force bases my whole life and seen some very unusual things in the sky, but this thing really freaked me out once it hit that this was something I had never observed before.   It wasn't a plane, or firework.  It wasn't and reflection of light or meteor.  It was an object of some sort like I have never seen.   I am 44 years old and very well read. I have lived in Europe, The USA, and Asia.;34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426
