Small craft - separated into 2 - sped off quickly.;2014-11-15 17:00:00;5 minutes;Small craft - separated into 2 - sped off quickly Noticed moving craft in sky @ 5:20 heading toward me at approx 5-10,000 feet. At one point the craft became 2 separate crafts.  They swirled around each other.  Craft continued to move in a non linear fashion. Craft came to complete stop and remained stationery for several minutes. As i tried to drive closer, i continually watched the craft hover. Suddenly, the craft sped away in a south west direction very very fast. I would estimate 5000 mph minimum.;34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426
