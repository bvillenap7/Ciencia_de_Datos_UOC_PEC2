I pulled my car into the tennis courts of my subdivision, up on a hill and watched until it came back into view.  I have a video of it.  it looks oval in the sky but on video more round. white illumination.  Hard to tell at night the size of this.  I'd say it was 1000 ft. up in the sky.  It was dark. Lasted for about 10 min. This is the third time I've seen this phenom.  The last time was off of highway 120 which is abut 2 miles from this area. I'll be happy to send an email.;34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426
