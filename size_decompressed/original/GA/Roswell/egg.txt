REFLECTIVE EYE SHAPED ORB SPOTTED DURING THE DAY.;2006-11-28 09:32:00;5 SECONDS;REFLECTIVE EYE SHAPED ORB SPOTTED DURING THE DAY. I WAS DRIVING DOWN hWY 9. ON MY WAY TO WORK AND NOTICED AN EYEBALL SHAPED SILVER METALIC OBJECT IN THE SKY POSSIBLY AT 15,00O FT DUE SOUTH EAST. I FOCUSED ON THE OBJECT AND THE OBJECT REFLECTED THE SUN LIKE A MIRROR. WITHIN ABOUT THREE SECONDS THE OBJECT ROTATED UPWARD LIKE AN EYELID WOULD OPEN. BUT, IT DISAPPEARED AS THIS HAPPENED. THE SKY WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR ON THAT MORNING NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY.;34.0336860962566;-84.3638481283426
