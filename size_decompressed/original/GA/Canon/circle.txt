He went and looked through his Zeiss binoculars at the star.  The STAR (or whatever it was), seemed round in shape.  It flashed the colors red, white and green.  I suggested that we compare the star to the other stars around the sky.  There were also at least 7-8 others ones.  Some seemed further away. They were stationary and only moved as the earth rotated. We have looked at the stars at other times using good quality spotting scopes and these were definitely not stars.;34.3447;-83.1239
