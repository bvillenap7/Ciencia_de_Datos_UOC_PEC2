Possible saucer like shape sighted over Ball Ground, GA, USA with one bright and one dim white light, and one red light. 1/2 mile long.;2009-01-09 19:00:00;<1 minute;Possible saucer like shape sighted over Ball Ground, GA, USA with one bright and one dim white light, and one red light. 1/2 mile long. At approximately Seven PM today, I was on my way home from a high school robotics team meeting. As I pulled into my subdivision, I noticed three lights moving close to one hundred miles per hour around a thousand feet. The one leading the craft(s) was a bright white, almost like a spotlight, the middle was less bright, and the third was red. That was all I could see. My subdivision cuts between two major roads, and on the other end of the subdivision, about 20 seconds away, there is a huge clearing. Once we got to the clearing, the craft was gone. We drove to a local convenience store where my friend was in there getting something to drink. He told me he was driving from Nelson along Hwy 5 when he saw this flying saucer. That is the only clue I have as to its shape.;34.3385;-84.3741
