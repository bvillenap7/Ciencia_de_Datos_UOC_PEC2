I was watching tv in my living room when I started to feel a shaking. At this time I did not hear anything unusual.  However I started hearing an eerie noise that sounded like a bomb dropping. I became alarmed and stepped out onto my front porch. I looked up (expecting to see a low-flying plane) I saw a plane shaped object that was very large and flying at low altitude.  I know that it was not a normal aircraft due to the fact that there is no airport large enough anywere even close to us. It had red lights all around the bottom outline of the frame. It had alot of oddly placed strobe lights and it was heading South.  The next morning I checked with a friend who lives just South of me if he had seen or heard anything strange the previous night and he described the exact same thing to me.;34.3385;-84.3741
