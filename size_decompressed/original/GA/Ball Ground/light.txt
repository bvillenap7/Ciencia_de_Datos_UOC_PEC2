Large diameter bright white orb (security camera video recording);2017-01-08 02:18:00;45 minutes;Large diameter bright white orb (security camera video recording) Reviewing security video, from last night, due to my dogs barking last night. When I was reviewing the security video I noticed a very bright orb enter the left top of the frame.  Almost the diameter of a full moon. The diameter of the object is surprising.  From the time of entry into the video frame, to loss of site behind the treeline is 45 min.  I don't know the scale, but about an 3/4 of travel in the video. I have never seen a planet nor a star with that much luminance, nor the diameter. We live in a heavily wooded area.  This video was taken through a dense tree line. The density of the orb overcomes this without distortion to the intensity until it dropped below the distant mountain tree line;34.3385;-84.3741
