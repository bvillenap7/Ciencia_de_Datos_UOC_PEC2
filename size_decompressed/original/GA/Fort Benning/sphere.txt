Benning, half our platoon came back going on and on about a UFO.  I thought the were just being stupid.  The other half of our platoon went out to do our portion of the training.  While out we heard a loud buzzing sound. Two people who were there the day before start yelling, It's coming, it's coming.  That's the sound we all heard before it appeared yesterday.   Sure enough, a metallic sphere, maybe the size of a beach ball or maybe a little bigger than a basketball, appears from behind the tree line, maybe 50 to 100 feet over the tree tops.  It hovered over us for a minute, or so (no doubt in my mind it saw us and was following and reacting to our presence) then, while keeping us in line of sight went out as far as a half mile or so.   Then it started coming close and backing off almost out of sight multiple times.  This entire time since it happened I thought it was a military drone.  I mean I never heard of a UFO making such a loud sound.   It sounded like it was running a motor to stay aloft.  Though it looked like a solid chrome metal sphere, which is like no drone I have heard of.  I was sure one day I would find out it was some experimental drone being tested on Ft. Benning.  To this day I have seen nothing of the sort.   I'm sure you'll read this and go duh, it's some drone that never saw production and that they get confused with ufo's all the time.  So if that's the case sorry for wasting your time.;32.3923;-84.9315
