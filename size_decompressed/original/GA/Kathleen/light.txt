What appeared to be a larger than normal flickering star began to slowly move down.;2019-11-23 18:30:00;Unknown;What appeared to be a larger than normal flickering star began to slowly move down. It had just cleared up from raining.  My significant other was closing the blinds for the day upon entering the dark kitchen before turning the lights on.  He was looking out of the dining room window which faces directly south, and noticed what appeared to be a very bright star.  He called to me to come look because we are normally moon & star gazers, and enjoy the evening skies.  It was slightly larger than what a star appears, but looked just like one to us.  We don't normally see that particular star so it seemed odd.  We watched for several minutes and began to realize it was very slowly moving down.  It eventually fell below the treeline where we could no longer see it.  We probably watched it for about 10 minutes or less.;32.4672;-83.6127999999999
