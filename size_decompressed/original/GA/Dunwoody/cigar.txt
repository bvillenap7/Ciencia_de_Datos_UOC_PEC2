shiny silver cigar shaped object seen in sky of Dunwoody Ga.;2011-02-08 15:00:00;10 seconds;shiny silver cigar shaped object seen in sky of Dunwoody Ga. I was traveling down 400 South between Holcomb Bridge and Northridge and observed an object in the sky that appeared out of no where. It was pretty much cigar shaped, it had a silver color...it reminded me of the color of mercury in a thermometer. It was very shiny. It dissapeared and then became visible almost instantly but it was further down the sky, then was gone. It definately was quicker than any airplane I have ever seen. As for my background.   I work in the hospice field and have a degree in psychology.;33.9462;-84.3346
