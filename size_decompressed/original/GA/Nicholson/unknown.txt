At approximately 21:40 on Friday October 20, 2006 a light flashed due south 50 degrees or 11:00.   The object was stationary or appeard to be so.  The flash was white.  The sky conditions were clear with many stars visible.   Commerical air traffic from Hartsfield International was traveling east.  Satellites were observed as non-blinking constant tracks.   The flash was noticeble because it remained stationary.  It did appear to flash in a diamond shape in the sky. The diamond shape being one flash and then the flash would appear to be slightly lower in the sky. This could have been an optical illusion.   The flash was a constant brightness and flashed at 5 second intervals for nearly five minutes.  It did not appear to be moving.  There was no sound such as would be made by a helicopter.  There were no other colors visible.   The flash was the brightness of a bright star. The intensity of the flash began to fade and then the flash stopped all together.   The event was observed by my wife as well.  I noticed it first and then called her over to witness and verfiy the event.;34.0955;-83.4175
