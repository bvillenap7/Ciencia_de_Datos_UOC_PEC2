very bright, with a beacon light too high to be helicopter,couldnt be airplane;1998-05-15 23:00:00;1 min;very bright, with a beacon light too high to be helicopter,couldnt be airplane Above trees, it was very bright, couldnt tell the shape. some witnesses thought maybe a helicopter,but it was to high up for that. What really caught our attention was the light that was comming form it,like a searchlight. but it didnt reach the ground just halfway. The light from it was moving unaturally,too fast and in odd directions.... It didnt stay very long for about 1 minute. but we didnt see where it went either.;33.3745629921262;-84.7983230314956

One red light moving across sky.;2013-02-13 22:30:00;15 seconds;One red light moving across sky. Went outside and looked up in the sky and saw 1 dark red light above, heading south-southwest.   Wasn't flashing, blinking, or anything, just stayed the same color moving in one direction at quite a fast speed.  I live about 30 min south of atlanta airport and i know what the planes look like, this was not a plane....just one dark red light...vantage point was from directly beneath and it moving south, didnt see any other lights with it.  No sound.;33.3745629921262;-84.7983230314956
I look and it's like a helicopter spot light is aiming directly at the house, but it is making zero noise.;2016-11-19 12:05:00;20 minutes;This is the second event, but both were identical.  The weather is cool out so we sleep with the window open. My wife called me to the bedroom and states that a bright light is shining through our window.  I look and it's like a helicopter spot light is aiming directly at the house, but it is naking zero noise. I went outside to inspect and it's just a hovering light like a bright white mini silent sun.   Each time it slowly fades and then disappears.  It is definitely within range to hear if it was a plane or helicopter.  No flashing lights.  Just a solid light.   I attempted to examine it through my tifle scope, but it was too bright to determine what it is.  Following its disappearance what seems to favor a fox bark has occurred each time.  That part could be a coincidence, but a rather strange one if you ask me.  We can't be the only ppl seeing this.  It obviously isn't attempting to stay hidden.

Small quick moving object emitting green light disappears;2019-08-18 20:55:00;4 seconds;Small quick moving object emitting green light disappears While driving down the road, my friend and I observed a small extremely fast moving object with a green light blocking the appearance of the object.  It was moving towards the ground, but out of nowhere, the green light disappeared and the object was no longer visible.  We both said, “Holy ((deleted)), did you see that?”;33.3745629921262;-84.7983230314956
