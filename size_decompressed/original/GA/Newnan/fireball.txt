Silent glowing fireballs flying in formation south of Atlanta, GA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from airline pilot.  PD));2011-11-19 18:35:00;3 minutes;Silent glowing fireballs flying in formation south of Atlanta, GA I was about to walk in the front door of my house in Newnan, GA, at 6:30pm on November 19, 2011, when I just happened to look up at the sky and see five or six (I was so surprised that I didn’t think to count the exact number) glowing orange fireballs in the sky.   They were moving from North to South in a long formation that was almost single file.  They were almost flickering like a fire seen from a distance, but they maintained a constant orange color throughout my observation.  I watched them move silently at a moderate speed to the south.  As they passed behind my house, I thought that I saw one of them make some erratic movements, but it might have simply been a distortion effect as there were some thin tree branches in the way on that side of the house.  They made no sound throughout the event.  An airliner passed to the west at about 15,000ft, maybe 20 miles away, and I would think that the crew probably would have seen it well if they had been looking in this direction, but during the busy time of an approach, they may not have noticed.  My house lies right under the arrival corridor for aircraft coming in to ATL from the Southwest, which is a very busy arrival, so there may have been other aircraft in the vicinity that I didn’t notice. Regarding my background, I am an airline pilot for a large airline based in Atlanta.;33.3745629921262;-84.7983230314956
Streak and bright flash over Newnan, GA, sky lastnight.;2014-08-23 23:00:00;15 seconds;Streak and bright flash over Newnan, GA sky last night. I was outside with my Friend talking around 11 pm on 8/23/2014 on the east side of Newnan, GA, when a streak of light grabbed both our attention.   It then flashed brightly and quickly faded away.  This was the strangest thing I have ever witnessed.  No sound at all came our way so it was not lightening or anything real close to us.   My wife happened to be driving a few miles away at that same time and said she saw the flash of light at that same time, but thought it was lightning.  I have seen hundreds of shooting stars over the years, but none ever brightly flashed like this.;33.3745629921262;-84.7983230314956
