Dark triangle object flies across Georgia sky;2017-10-30 22:45:00;6 seconds;Dark Triangle Object flies across Georgia sky. It was Oct. 30th, around 10:50pm. I had just pulled into my girlfriend’s apartment complex and got out of the car to greet her. As we walked towards her building I pointed out how perfect the night sky was, there was not a cloud to be seen and all the stars were shining brilliantly. We took a minute to gaze in wonder at some of the constellations. It was at that moment I noticed a dark mass speed into my field view from my left to right. There was no aura around the object, no blinking lights, no emitting beam, and no sound being made.  I could hear only the night. As the object flew across the sky in front of us, it was briefly illuminated by either the moon light above it, or light from the ground. But again, there was no light emitting from the object in question. I was able to make out more detail within the few seconds dim light was cast upon the object. It was without a doubt triangle shaped. It was just dark as the night sky surrounding it. There were numerous white/opaque circles that dotted the inside perimeter of the triangle shaped object. But again, there was no light being emitted.  Or at least it seemed. To me, it looked like the surrounding light made it possible to see the circles.  It was very dim but you could see the contrast within the triangle shape. Seeing it move away from us, it appeared to be a rather flat triangle. It did not stop or make any change in direction, but appeared to stay on a straight path the entire time. It looked to be at an altitude a small plane would at if it were coming into land. However, the object carried on in a very straight line, very rapidly. This whole encounter happened very fast. it lasted maybe 6 – 10 seconds. But it left both my girlfriend and I completely dumbfounded and awestruck as to what we had both just witnessed.;33.3745629921262;-84.7983230314956
