Making absolutely no noise whatsoever. these 3 crafts were very low in the sky. I was standing outside my house with my brother and two long lost friends (NO DRUGS). tHESE WERE THE MOST DIFERENT SHAPED OBJECTS I'VE EVER SEEN TO THIS DATE. They look as far as we could tell in the dark , except for the lights which gave us an idea as to the shap. The shape was that of a furnace flying slow with white and blue almost an electrical blue on the top. Around the center were an amber colored litebut sharper a color I've ever seen.Now , On the bottom the only lites i seem to remember were spot lights that I could see hiting the tops of the houses at the bottom of the hill. It was really weird ! I was almost scared. These were at tree top level and never made a sound. I'll never forget that long as I live. Incredable is all I can say. Thanks for your time !
