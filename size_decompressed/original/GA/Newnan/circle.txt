I saw a red light at first. It looked like a spec in the sky.  I thought it might be an airplane on fire in the night sky.  Red color was pulsating from the source. It appeared to come closer and got larger than any other star in the night sky.  I was facing east and after about 2 minutes it seemed to get further away and then disappeared completely.
