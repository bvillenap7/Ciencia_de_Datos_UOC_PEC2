On 02/23/00 at 2255 hrs I noticed that the two lights I had been watching had got much closer and bigger,i was on the south west side of the perimeter looking over the prison to the north east,I drove to the parking lot and turned around now going in a clock wise direction as i turned the corner now heading north I was looking straight into the lights i drove on to the next corner and before turning east I stoped the truck because the object was directly in front of me and hovering about a hundred yards above the trees and about 1000 yds. behind the prison.as I got out of the truck it started moving toward me very slow i watched as it passed over top of me.it looked like a very very large triangle with lights outlining its shape and one seemed to be in the middle blinking I did not hear any noise at all, the night was clear, cool and still from the time I first saw the lights untill it passed over me was about 30 min.(Something else when i took post at 2150 hrs the Air Force Jets were flying over the prison I didn`t give that much thought because they do that every now and then.) I waited a while before I radioed main control and reported what I had seen because I knew they would think I was crazy,she laughted and wanted to know if I needed to be relieved even tho I had only been on duty one hour.I have no idea what this thing was, but it could hover, it made no noise,moved off very slow and was the biggest thing I have ever saw.You may contact me if you wish to do so.;32.7213;-82.7272
