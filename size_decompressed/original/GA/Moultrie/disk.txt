Orange, hazy light that was moving very quickly then dissaperd.;2011-01-04 19:40:00;10 Minutes;Orange, hazy light that was moving verry quickly then dissaperd. I was standing out side of my house when i saw two jets fly over my house.  I looked toward the north star and i saw what looked like to be a plane light at first.  I told my dad hey look at that plane, how come it does not have a blinking light?  Then he said it is gone. I tried to find it and it was gone.  If it was a low flying plane it would have still been seen in the short amount of time.  I tried to call my friend on my cell phone and i had no service.  I usually have service where I was at the time.;31.1487269662921;-83.7368977528091
