Local DJ reports UFO above radio station.;1971-06-01 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Local DJ reports UFO above radio station. IN 1971 I was a DJ at local radio station in Moultrie, Ga.  A week prior we had damage to the control room so we rented a 40' mobile home to broadcast out of until repairs were complete.  It was parked about 10' from the back door of the station were the all the power supply were kept.  Back then, the meters had to be read and written down on the hour and half hour. I remember it was 9 pm.  I announced the call letters, put on a 45 record, grabbed my notebook and proceeded out the back door of the mobile home.  As I opened the door, i looked up, then dropped everything I had.  Above the mobile home was a bright cigar shaped object with different colors going all around the outside perimeter of the object.  I could't tell where one color stopped and another color started.  It was as if they blended perfectly.  No sound was made from the object and if hovered just a few feet from the top of the mobile home.  If I were standing on top, I could have touched it with ease.  It scared me so bad I raced back inside to the mic and made the announcement.  Cars begin to pull down the 100 yard lane off the main highway that lead down to the station which was blocked from the main highway by a tree line.  By this time I had returned outside and had joined the gathering crowd.  At first it moved up slowly about 200 feet and stopped.  Then repeated that same move.  On the third time it went up about 100 more feet and took off at a slant so fast, all we seen was a flash trail from it. Everyone stood still for a moment, then started talking to each other and finally left.  I went back inside and told again what we had seen.  I was told a few days later by three men who came to the  station that it was just a weather balloon.  The local newspaper did a story the next day and that was the end of it.  I know what I saw.
