Two lighted objects were moving very fast across the night sky when one caught up with the other and it fell from the sky.;2014-06-19 22:45:00;10 minutes;Two lighted objects were moving very fast across the night sky when one caught up with the other and it fell from the sky. On June 19, 2014, from 10:45 pm-11:00pm, my husband and I witnessed two lighted objects in the sky that were very close together.  The objects caught our attention because they were very close to each other, had lights that resembled airplanes, and were moving very fast.   They were moving from east to west in the sky.  The first lighted object, which was in front, had white lights.  The second lighted object had red, green, and white lights, that were bright and constantly blinking. The second lighted object caught up to the first and for a couple of seconds they appeared to be one lighted object.   Then, the white-lighted object appeared to fall from the sky and we lost sight of it behind the trees. The brighter blinking object immediately reversed its direction and headed away to the northwest.  We watched this object until we could no longer see it. This was the most unusual thing we have ever witnessed and I am compelled to report the event. My husband is a surgeon and I am a homemaker.  We are in our mid 50â€™s.;31.1487269662921;-83.7368977528091
