The stars are alive;2006-07-26 06:01:00;45-50 seconds;The stars are alive I was driving home from getting coffee this morning,and noticed two stars,one bigger than the other, well I thought it was stars. I was about to turn and then the bigger star moved, I mean enough to get my attention and make me pull over and get out. Time seemed like it paused for a while,a man and his friend was walking up the road and they started pointing up. The regular size star just stood still while the bigger one moved towards the north. Just when I was going to pass it off for just a falling star, the big one started moved sideways and faster. It flickered, and then vanished and reappeared back by the spot by the regular looking star. A hugh square of the sky around the two objects went black and the big object sort of disappeared in the darkness, but the smaller one still shined like a star. One of the people that were watching began walking away saying that he had seen enough, I stayed.The big object seemed to appear grayish as it reappeared from the darkness. ( and that was the strangest part to me, you could see color at 6:00am in the morning, that far up in the sky.) In about 40 secs the big object started away from the small one and seemed to go faster and faster away. Then the big object turned grayish blue and vanished.;31.1487269662921;-83.7368977528091

I told her to look at the crept star and then we went in house.  We came out later to see it gone and when we saw a plane overhead we seen that so called star following and hovering near it we kept watch until they both flew through clouds.;31.1487269662921;-83.7368977528091
