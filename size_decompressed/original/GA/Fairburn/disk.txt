UFO sighting in Fairburn, GA around the fall of the year.;1981-09-01 19:00:00;Few minutes;UFO sighting in Fairburn, GA around the fall of the year. The object seemed to follow me as I ran to the back porch of my grandmother's home. I screamed for someone to let me in and that there was a UFO outside. My uncles were standing in the front yard and the object resided there for a few seconds. The lights on the saucer moved opposite of counter-clockwise. They seemed to chase each other much like chasing lights you see at Christmas time. The object hovered around the front porch of the house for a few seconds then disappeared. It moved that fast. There one minute, gone the next. The surface area of the craft was bigger than my grandmother's house--her house was average sized, somewhat big. My uncle called the local airport to see if there were any testing going on in the area. None were reported and no weather balloons had been released. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));33.5631;-84.5832
