What first caught my eye was it looked like the stars were moving and as I looked closer, it appeared as a boomerang shaped flying object, possibly the size of a football field.  It seemed like it was like a chamelion and taking on the stars patterns overhead, but we could definitely make out a shape.  It was totally silent, just gliding overhead.  It was headed toward the full moon.  When it got probably a couple of miles away from us it stopped and appeared to flip on its side and one end of the boomerang folded in on itself and it stayed there the entire time during the eclipse.  The three of us who witnessed it, 2 are registered nurses and 1 is a computer programer. All of us are older, 42, 45, and 55, and we had not been drinking or partaking drugs. We were just out to watch the lunar eclipse.;34.692;-85.2602000000001
