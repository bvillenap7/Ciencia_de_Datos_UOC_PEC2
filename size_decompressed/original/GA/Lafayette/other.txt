A small globe descended from beneath the larger craft.;1991-10-01 22:00:00;15 min.;A small globe descended from beneath the larger craft. I am a lifelong resident of LaFayette and work in the offices of a local manufacturing plant.I have told this experience only three times, one of those being a report to MUFON. I will state for the record that the date of the sighting is an extreme guess and I did not review my report to MUFON to make sure both dates matched. I was sitting on the front porch facing South. As I glanced upward I saw a craft moving North to South. The craft was triangular, but with smoothed corners.The underside was in three segments of different colors. There was absolutely no sound. As for the size, I am not astute at gaging distances and sizes.The object was either very large or quite low.I have thought about this a lot and my personal conclusion is that the object was quite high and large. As I sit on the poarch quite often,I see a lot of military and civilian aircraft moving between Chattanooga and Atlanta. This object was moving too SLOW to be a jet or airplane. A helicopter is ruled out for reasons mentioned earlier. The craft seemed to float almost like a blimp. I watched the craft for approximately 7 minutes float? in a straight line. At that time, a small white globe? descended from underneath the craft. The globe? stayed close to the larger craft and seemed to play around it. This was the point I became a little nervous, because this action reminded me of  animal behavior, like a bear cub frolics aroud its' mother. The two crafts then turned (not sharply, but in a long, slow arc) and retraced the exact path the larger craft had used. I had never seen anything unusual beforehand and have not since.
