A triangular-shaped huge object (the size of a football field) hovered just above the tree tops with flashing red lights.  It made no sound and then vanished.  Approximately 10 minutes later what looked like the same or an identical object hovered over my house, moved very slowly and disappeared again.  Approximately 10 minutes later we saw what appeared to be the same object but was miles away in the sky and we recorded that on video.  You can only see the red flashing lights from the video.;31.9587;-83.781
