I do not know what this was, but it looked like 2 objects side by side entering our atmosphere going east to weat passing over Atlanta GA,  Each object had two tails coming from them like an inverted V.  Sure would like to know what this siting was..  It lasted too long for a plane and too short for a comet.;33.5637;-83.1702
