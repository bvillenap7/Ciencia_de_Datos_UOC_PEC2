Pulsating slow moving white light in northeast sky.;2013-08-26 04:40:00;5-7 minutes;Pulsating slow moving white light in northeast sky. Saw a circular, pulsating object in the northeastern sky from my position near Greensboro, GA right off of Hwy 15.  It appeared to be moving from north to east.  It was slow moving.  It was pulsating from a bright whitish light to almost a non existent light.  I lost the object in some cloud cover. I have been out at this time of morning for over 15 years.  I have seen aircraft with landing/takeoff lights on at this time.  They are steady brightness.  I have also seen stars that flicker.   This did not follow the patterns I have seen established for these types of objects in my many years on the go at this time of morning.;33.5637;-83.1702
