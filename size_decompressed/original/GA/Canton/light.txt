I decided to smoke a cigarette next to my window so I wouldnt blow smoke in the house.  I noticed a bright light in front of my house so I looked at it not thinking anything about it, the sky is pretty dark right now.   As I looked at it the light got a bit brighter and it went off to the right.  It went across my view in about a half a second and vanished out of my view.
