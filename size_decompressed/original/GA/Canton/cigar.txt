Hi, my wife and I have withnessed over 100+ unknown aircraft all flying from the south toward north and North East within the past 2 hours. They all have a bright golden yellow color and red color light and they all move 10 times faster than any aircraft Ive ever seen.  Then some will hover in the same spot for about 15-20 mins then instantly Fly away at a super fast speed.  They do not have any sound from them at all. I wish I knew what was going on here.  We figure it's maybe the Government Sending out some sort of Aireal drones for some reason.  Due south about 35 miles is Dobbins Military Air Force base.;34.2235174193549;-84.4529929032261
