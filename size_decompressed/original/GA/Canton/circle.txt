Saw entire underbelly clearly.  Read description. At around 3:00 am, I awoke and walked in the dark to the front room which has a turret shape to it, with near floor to ceiling windows.  As I walked to just in front of the small desk that sits directly in the center of the 3 windows, for I was concentrating on the center window and was going to look out to the yard and street, as I had done before, hoping to see deer passing.  However, as I stopped just in front of the desk in the dark, to my immediate right and just over my 3 car garage was a huge round dull silver saucer shaped craft.  It was no more than 30 feet off the ground and engulfed the rooftop of the garage, with about another 10 feet sticking out beyond the roof.  I could see most of the craft and its underbelly very clearly.  The underbelly had sectioned bars that radiated the underside much like you would section out a pie.  Between the sections and on the edges of the slices or between the bars, were round white soft lights.  The ! lights were not illuminating toward the ground as a spotlight would.   I stood there studying the craft in utter amazement and wanted to not take my eyes off it or call out to the others sleeping in the house for I knew this was a fleeting moment and wanted to take in exactly what I was seeing.  I then saw it start to very slowly move from above the garage to just over the turret that I was standing in.  As it moved I leaned to the far right window to watch it go overhead.  All the curtains were open, as they always are, but as it went over the turret section of the house, I could no longer see it.  With my peripheral  vision, I tried to watch all windows to see any movement, but that was all I saw of it.;34.2235174193549;-84.4529929032261
