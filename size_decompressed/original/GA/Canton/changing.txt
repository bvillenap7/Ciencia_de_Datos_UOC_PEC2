They appeared to be a brillant white color but at times would flash green and blue in to the globe part.  there were no lighted distractions in the sky and they stould out clearly beyond and of the other stars around them.  As we traveled it felt as if they followed our path.  They also like to be just beyond the treeline like they are playing hide and seek ..... these lights have started appearing in October and they're still here in November.  They will change direction and flash while they follow you.  once i arrived home - there they were again.  just hanging out in my night sky.  Can they be planets beginnging the alignment we are all hearing about - OR could they be some type of ufo - they're definetly something.;34.2235174193549;-84.4529929032261
