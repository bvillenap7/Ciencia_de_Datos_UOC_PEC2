Black spec passing in front of the moon several times.;2006-10-03 21:00:00;a few seconds at a time f;Black spec passing in front of the moon several times. I was looking through my telescope that my mother gave me tonight ( i dont know anything about telescopes) and while i was fascinated by the lunar surface i saw a tiny black spec zoom across the surface of the moon, it only lasted about 2 seconds and then it was gone, the moon was more than three quarters full. i watched and waited for about 7 mins and i saw it again. (now i cant be sure but i think it changed direction while passing between my telescope and the moons surface.) i watched for this again and saw it three more times. i then went into the house and told my wife what i had seen. oh my god, your an idiot she said. i talked her into watching for the same thing. 5 mins i told her. just 5 mins. she agreed and actually saw it after about 5 mins of moon gazing. she thinks it was a bug crossing the glass of the telescope, so i waved my finger in front of it while she looked through and could not see my finger. so i asked her how could she see a bug? she thinks im crazy but i think this is a craft of somekind and that it had to be extremely large to see from my puny telescope. anyone one else see this?;34.2235174193549;-84.4529929032261
2 bright beautiful Orange circles.  Canton, GA.;2015-05-08 23:00:00;5 minutes;2 bright beautiful Orange circles. canton ga witness with me!  2 people saw this together 5/8/15 11pm Canton, GA.   We just saw 2 large slowly moving bright beautiful orange circles going strait then vanish.  No clouds.  No tree lines.  We saw the first one and we have pictures and video. Our dogs and the coyotes were all barking right before it happened and it went silent.  The second one did the same thing as the first.  We used a scope to look and clear as day each object was a dark center circle with a very bright glow.  Was not far away.   I have never seen anything in my life make animals go crazy like that.  Our dogs woke us up and we went outside and the coyotes were making so much noise and before I know it I am watching the most majestic thing of my life.  Watching what I just saw, I will go to my grave defending this and I have 3 videos I want professionals to look at.  No joke.  No bs.   We we just saw was the best thing that ever happened to me and I will never forget this. When we came inside our tv was not working and both of our phones would not let us use the internet or data.  The dogs sat silent with us outside.  With my own eyes, I watched our dogs looking at the sky in silence.;34.2235174193549;-84.4529929032261
