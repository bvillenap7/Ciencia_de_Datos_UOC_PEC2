Green fireball seen early morning in Cherokee County.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a long-duration meteor green possibly from copper.  PD));2012-03-24 06:46:00;8 seconds;Green fireball seen early morning in Cherokee County. Saturday, 3/24/12 , I was driving on my way to work when I saw a brilliant green fireball shoot across the sky , south southwest along the lower part of the horizon.   I knew it was a meteor, but it was the first one I have ever seen that was so relatively close as far as size.  My guess was approximately 20 miles, but it was large enough that you could see the light reflect off the tree tops, it was very bright, one of the most beautiful sights in the sky I have ever seen.
