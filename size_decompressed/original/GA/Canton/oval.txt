One second it was there and then the next it was just gone.;2009-06-02 14:00:00;3 minutes;I was outside during my lunch break and noticed a dark round object in the blue sky. What really drew my attention was that it wasn’t moving.  It stayed in the same spot for about 2 minutes and then I saw a flash from the object like a reflection perhaps and then it just disappeared. One second it was there and then the next it was just gone. I didn’t see the way it went it just wasn’t there any longer. It was very high in the sky. Location of object was Canton Ga;34.2235174193549;-84.4529929032261
Black oval craft emitting a orange light trail completely silent.;2013-05-09 21:45:00;10 seconds;black oval craft emitting a orange light trail completely silent. Streak of orange light approx.10 to 15 yards in length with black oval shaped craft in front of the light.  Completely silent.  Had a unusual distortion around the craft.  Like a shimmering of the air around it.  We saw its for approximately 10 seconds before completely disappearing right in front of us.  We were about 500 yards away from the craft.  I am self employed, my wife along with two neighbors witnessed the craft.;34.2235174193549;-84.4529929032261
