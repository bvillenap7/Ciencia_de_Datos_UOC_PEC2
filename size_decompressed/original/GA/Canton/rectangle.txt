Two adult males witness two quadrilateral objects in the daytime sky.  Objects just suddenly disappear.;2017-09-27 08:52:00;2 minutes;September 27, 2017.   UFO  Reporting   Early morning  on September 27, 2017,  waiting for Farm Bureau rep to inspect my daughters Roof for damage.  Farm Bureau rep pulled into driveway, getting out of car I noticed he was looking toward the garage roof , I looked upward toward roof  and saw two small trailer-looking craft.  We both looked at each other and said well we did not see this a UFO. No noise was coming from craft,  they were very bright silver in color.  At one time stood Motionless in sky.  I got my iphone camera out, was on live view so did not get the pictures I thought I would get.  What I saw with my eyes was not what the iphone recorded.  Do not understand this.   Again the Farm Bureau rep talked we agreed we would write this off who would believe us. The UFO  was trailer shape   20X40 at the most  no noise or lights.  Speed leaving was not from this world, gone in the blink of the eye. I did call Cherokee Sheriff dept  , they came out   gave report. Called the FAA at 10:54 and talked to Torrance L Branch  operation mananger  770-210-7622.  Also sent him pictures of What I saw.  Again  they turn up as little bright patches in sky, this is not what your eyes see. When you first see a UFO  you do not know how to react, it is something the mind does not Know how to sort out. Contacted National UFO Reporting Center, talked to Peter Davenport by phone and filing this report. Awaiting word from FAA if this was in radar in the Atlanta,Ga area.  We are not alone. Thank you ((personal information deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be quite serious-minded.  PD));34.2235174193549;-84.4529929032261
