PD));2005-04-17 23:00:00;45 minutes;Object appeared to be a star at first glance sitting low on the horizon I noticed that the object seemed to be pulsating different that the other stars. night sky was extremely clear. using binoculars, I looked first at the object and noticed that it was, while always staying bright white, it was emanating smaller bursts of green,red, and blue bursts upon it's constant white background. using a reference point, a telephone pole, I observed the object stay in one spot, never moving. I used my binoculars to look at some other stars and compare them to object. all the other stars were nothing like the object I was observing, except that they were'nt moving. around 2355, went inside to get camera and came back outside to discover the object had completely dissapeared. At least 2 aircraft were observed in the vicintiy of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the report is not inconsistent with a sighting of the star, Sirius.  PD));33.4485;-82.2011000000001
