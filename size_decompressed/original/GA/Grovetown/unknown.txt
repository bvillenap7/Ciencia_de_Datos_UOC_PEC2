Gordon.;2004-11-18 22:45:00;1 minute 30 seconds;Observed a strange sequence of multicolored lights hovering silently in the sky approximately 1000 feet away, just outside Ft. Gordon. Some time in November 2004 at approximately 10:45 PM, three of my friends and I were playing basketball in the street of our neighborhood. Shortly after one of my friends walked inside his house one of us pointed out a strange sequence of lights that seemed to hover in place roughly 300-400 feet up and 600-700 feet south of where we were standing, slightly west of the gate 2 entrance of Fort Gordon Army base. We observed approximately 9 circular lights evenly spaced a few feet apart on a horizontal plane, blinking in random sequence, each emitting multiple colors of red, white, yellow and green light. The lights lit up in no particular order or color, sometimes one at a time, sometimes all at once, from right to left, left to right, and in pairs from the outermost toward the middle. It stayed in one place for approximately 90 seconds and was completely silent. The lights did not drift, tilt, rotate or move from their position in the sky until the very end wh! en they abruptly moved further southwest in a straight trajectory slightly up and to the right, distal to our position, at an unnatural rate of speed. The object seemed to move without inertia, instantly achieving a very high rate of speed as it moved away toward a higher altitude, never passing over the horizon, and covering a great distance in just a few seconds until we could no longer see it. We could not see the outline of a craft, only the lights themselves and their shape and color.;33.4485;-82.2011000000001
Glowing orange lights South of Augusta, GA.;2013-12-10 18:30:00;1-2 minutes;Glowing orange lights South of Augusta GA. At approximately 1830 I was standing in our driveway in Grovetown, GA, and witnessed some unusual lights to the south just above the tree line.  The lights were a dark orange in color and seemed to be very large however I have no reference point by which to make any claims to their actual size.  As a light would begin to glow it would gradually increase in intensity and after a second or so, begin to decrease in intensity as another light in close proximity to it would then begin to increase in intensity.   It seemed there were four of these lights in a row and they would sequentially glow on and off in sequence until all four had lit up.  Then we wouldnâ€™t see any activity for a few moments until the light sequence would begin again very near the previous location.  After seeing this for a couple of iterations, the activity stopped.  I observed a single orange light glow and increase in intensity and then decrease again at the very beginning of the event and at the end.  My wife also witnessed this activity and we attempted to film it, however we were not fast enough and were only able to capture the single glowing light at the very end of the event.;33.4485;-82.2011000000001
