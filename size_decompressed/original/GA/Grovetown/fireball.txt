They were moving relatively slowly and very bright. I have never seen anything like it before.  I've seen Drones before and this was NOTHING like that in comparison.  I watched them for about 3 minutes, one disappeared, and the other remained climbing to higher altitudes until it was no longer visable.;33.4485;-82.2011000000001
