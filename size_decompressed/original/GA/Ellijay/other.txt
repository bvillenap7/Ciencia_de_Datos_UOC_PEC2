A vertical line of flashing lights.  A rhythmic flashing then just started spazzing out. ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of several reports submitted on this date, some of which appear to us to be possible hoaxes.  We cannot be certain about each individual case, but it appears to us that either an individual, or perhaps a group of people, submitted a number of reports in rapid sequence, all of which seem to bear characteristics which our Center has come to associate with hoaxed reports.
