We were riding through an older part of the area which just seemes to be in use for the bypass we were taking to get into the city of Hiram GA. I was watching an airplane go across the sky when I noticed what looked like a black blur, I will say ,very close to the plane. I thought at first it could have been another plane farther back but in the same scope of site, however the said object after moving in the direction of the plane began to move directly away from the plane a considerable distance and moved behind a cloud. I watched for the object to reappear and it did so, however at this point I could make out that the craft seemed to be less a blur now and more crescent shaped. It almost looked as if the craft could have had some form of wingspan. It was moving back and forth in a very small area of space and the feeling I received or felt was like it was motioning as if to say Look at me. Then the object dissapeared beneath the same cloud and we made a turn off that road towards our destination. I have to say I am a big believer in U.F.O. phenomena as my Mother had extreme experiences but I have never actually seen one until this day nor have I ever heard of this shape or color of craft.  Thanks for listening.;33.7655;-84.6468999999999
