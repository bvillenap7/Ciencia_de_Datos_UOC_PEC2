I called him to look but in seconds it dissapeared. Then over the period of about an hour I saw 3 more like it all moving in different directions which he was also able to see. I believe they moved too quickly to be satelites but I won't rule it out, but each one seemed to move not in any straight direction but seemed to snake along ..especially the second one we both saw. I am also requesting information on how satelites would appear from earth in speed and direction. I live near hartsfield airport and I didn't notice many planes at all tonight. Anyhow , thanks for listening .;33.7655;-84.6468999999999
Light moving west to east.;2020-06-26 23:00:00;~30 seconds;Light moving west to east. Solid white light with very slight blue hue, spherical. Light traveled west to east at a steady pace. Speed was faster than an air plane but still easily observable. Light moved in a fairly direct path, linear, but some slight ups and downs, and gave an impression of floating rather than a planes motion whisp like. My first thought was that it could be a drone, but no blinking lights at all, and I had a feeling of excitement, like it was aware of me. (I actually waved) It was pitch dark out last night, and looking at the horizon and tree line today it must have been just above the tree line from my perspective, and must have been rather large or very close. Closing thoughts either drone with no blinkers at all, or ET/Spirit. Feeling leans toward non-drone. Also, it was quite stormy around the time of sighting wind was up, and rain had recently abated.;33.7655;-84.6468999999999
