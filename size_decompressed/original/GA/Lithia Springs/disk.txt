When i saw a light off in the distance .We were talking and didnt think anything about it but we were going straight toward it. i will tell you every thing so,i ask him (my friend )if there was a house on this dirt road and he said no . the light was still in front of us.We were traveling toward the light so i said that it must be a range tower. We were talking and laughing but the light was till in front of us. we were still driving toward the light.We went down in a dip in the road and came out to see the light again. and i said off the top of my head that it was a UFO and we both laughed. We went down in another bottom and when we came out we were looking at a UFO . This ufo was tree top high and was 30 to 40 feet around with lights that blink around the object.We were in a 66 chev, i rolled down the window and climbed out on the window ceil. looking straight up at this ufo We were still driving down the road with the ufo right above us. there was no sound,this went on foraround 5 min.then like a sparkler at night that you swing around you seeing  the light trail the craft was gone. We were not going to say anything to anyone when we got back home but when we got to my house our wifes wanted to no what was wrong , the 11:00 news was on the TV . Os we started telling them and as we thought they laughed well at that time the news man told off a state patrol officer crossing over six flags and the river sighted and reported a ufo.things where different after that?

Object was moving very fast and headed South at cloud levels. Object suddenly changed direction and moved out of sight. Object was apparently moving out of visible range from an airplane(Passenger Plane) flying in its path. Object made incredibly fast turns as it changed directions. Object was observed out of a window from inside my home and was visible to the naked eye. Object had a hazey appearance but was clearly disc shaped. Unusual noise or sound was not observed. Weather was beautiful and the sky was partly cloudy. End of Report.;33.7655;-84.6468999999999
