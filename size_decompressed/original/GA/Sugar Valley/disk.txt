The craft seen was a silver disc, approximately 15 to 20 feet in diameter. It seemed to float from behind a very large tree. As it moved from behind the tree, it hovered about 8 feet above the ground, but began to elevate and increase it's speed. It slowly moved toward another tree. Both witness had blue light shining on them. They also lost conciousness for several minutes. When they regained conciousness, they were standing in different locations and positions. When the craft reached the other tree it tilted onto it's side and began to wobble. It appeared that the craft would tip over on top of the two witness, so they began running away. They then turned back to see the craft shoot away from the tree at a very high speed out over a feild and then dissappear. The craft was silent while hovering, but made a very distinct noise as it shot away. The following day, the witnesses returned to the sight. They discovered distinct and unusual markings on the ground and tree correlating to what they experienced.;34.5511;-85.0312
