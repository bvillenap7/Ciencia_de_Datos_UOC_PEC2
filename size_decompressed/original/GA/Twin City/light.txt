Slow blinking horizontal lights that disappeared over a field.;2015-01-08 20:00:00;45 seconds;Slow blinking horizontal lights that disappeared over a field. We were driving home from dinner. myself, my husband, and my two young sons.  We were less than a mile from our home when we came to an opening over a field, and we saw 6 bright lights just over the field, but still knew that it was on the other side of the highway. They were in a horizontal line.   The lights alternated blinking, however it was clear that there were 2 sets of 3 lights.  They were bright, round and yellow.  Each light would slowly fade in and out and they each did it at different times.   We stopped the car to try to figure out exactly what we were looking at.  As we did, the 3 lights on the right side each took a turn lighting up seperately, only to never re-light.  Then the one on the left followed suit.   The sky was completely clear and empty.  No clouds.  Just stars in the distance.  No noise.  It just complelty disappeared.  Or seemed to.;32.6109;-82.1997
