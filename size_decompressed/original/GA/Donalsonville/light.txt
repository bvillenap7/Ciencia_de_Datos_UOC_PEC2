July 22, 2019 I have brain cancer and couldn't sleep.I walked out to my back porch that over looks lake Seminole in Donalsonville,  Ga.  As I was looking at all the stars in the sky I noticed what looked like a larger star , that is until it moved!!  I went inside and woke my boyfriend up to come look at it to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  When we both came back outside,  the object shot a bright white light that traveled across the sky then exploded right above the tree line over the lake without sound.  I was so shocked I pulled out my phone and stared recording the object and caught the object on video.  I have coordinates and video to provide. * please excuse my language in the video. I could not believe what I was seeing!!!! Still can not! These are the approximate coordinates taken from our bedroom. We did not go back outside after this video. Still in shock by what we experienced. 246° SW 30°49'25N 84°52'1W 80ft elevation;31.0506;-84.8876
