Multiple lights seemingly interacting.;2014-04-21 05:30:00;Hour;Multiple lights seemingly interacting. At 5:30, I went outside to smoke a cig.  It was a clear and silent morning.   I love to look at the constellations and noticed 2 lights in the distance.   I figured planes or choppers but they were stationary then lost altitude, and gained it they moved back and forth.  The bright blue white one was a constant color and shape.   The other however changed color and vanished.   After seeing this I woke up my in laws.  They pointed out others.  They looked Like planes all headed the same way.  Whenever they passed in the bright one's vicinity, they slowed down and dipped. This went on for an hour.;33.8289;-85.1478
