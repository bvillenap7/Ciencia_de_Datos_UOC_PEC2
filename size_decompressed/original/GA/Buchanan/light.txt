Peculiar  flashing lights over Buchanan, Georgia!;2006-10-14 22:00:00;3-5 Minutes;Peculiar  flashing lights over Buchanan, Georgia! It was an extremely clear October night approximately 10:00PM or so.  I decided to go out onto the back deck of my house and enjoy the clear and crisp night air.   I must have been out for no more than 10 minutes or so when I decided to turn around and view the stars that were behind me, toward the southern sky.  As I did, a bright white light caught my eye.   At first, I thought nothing of it as I believed it to be nothing more than a flickering star.  However, the more I stared, the more I realized it was much more.  At first, the object was stationary in the sky and began flashing every 5-7 seconds.   After about a minute or so of this activity, another object to it's left flashed once.  Then, the object I initially viewed began moving toward the north.  For whatever reason, it then moved back to it's orignal location.   It continued to move back and forth a couple of times and I took this opportunity to run into my house and tell my fiance.  He then came out and he too witnessed the object move and flash, one last brilliant flash and then one final faded flash. It then disappeared.  We never saw the object again after that, although we did look for it.;33.8289;-85.1478
