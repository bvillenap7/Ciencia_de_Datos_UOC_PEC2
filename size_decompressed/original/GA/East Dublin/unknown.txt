Unexplained lights in East Dublin, Georgia.;2007-11-26 20:45:00;20 seconds;Unexplained lights in East Dublin, Georgia. My wife, friend, and I saw a line of 3 lights. Each of these lights had a yellowish-oranginsh glow. The lights seemed as if they were traveling at a downward angle from left to right at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. I would guess that they were at an altitude of 1000ft. The light to the far right began to fade but soon reappeared.  After this, they all disappeared. It didn't seem as if they flew away, but rather dissapeared.  At first, I believed this to be the result of cloud cover.  After I stopped the car to get a closer look, we noticed that there were no clouds in that particular area.  Although this was at night, I am confident that there were no clouds in the area of the aircraft.;32.5522;-82.8721
