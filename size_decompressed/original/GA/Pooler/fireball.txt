It flew across half of the sky in about 4 seconds. It did not have a tail of ANY kind. It was just a huge ball of light. It did not look like ANY shooting star I have ever seen. It did not make any sound. I lost sight of it once it went past some trees. Ok, I am a 17 year old teenager. I have been intersted in UFOs for years.
