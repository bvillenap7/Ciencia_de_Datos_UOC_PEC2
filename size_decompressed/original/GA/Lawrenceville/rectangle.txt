Driving past the rail road I saw a bright white light up in the sky over a wooded area.  It was  was betweeen a rectangular and an oval shape.  Being suprised, I turned my car immidiately around and parked on the side of the road to look.    I watched his light for about another 2-3 minutes.  It did not move up, down or to either side.  It just stayed in the same place.  Then it began to slowly fade awa.  It just became dimmer and dimmer until it was completly gone.     I am not by any means saying this was a  UFO, Alian or other.  I do not believe in UFOs, Aliens, the Easter bunny, or  God.   However, I saw this light and could not identify it other than to say I never say one before in my 38 yrs.  Two other vehicles passed , one while it was there and the next while it was fadding away. I do not know if they saw this too.
