The craft approached with a golden glow, however when it began to hover it changed to different colors of the rainbow.  It went from an indigo color to aqua, to green to yellow, yellow to orange, and orange to red.   After several minutes of hovering over the same area it appeared to fly away but it appeared as it was landing at the same time because the light was the same brightness.    Several of the witnesses tried to record the sighting on their phone, but the object did not show up on video.   I’ve always had a suspicion UFOs are real, but having other witnesses by my side assured me that I’m not crazy.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
Stationery Rumbling in Sky for 10 minutes.  Not a plane or helicopter.;2020-03-10 08:45:00;5-7 minutes;Stationery Rumbling in Sky for 10 minutes.  Not a plane or helicopter. I heard what I thought was a plane flying overhead (which is not uncommon) but it seemed to last for a couple minutes so I went outside on my deck to look but only heard what sounded like a very, loud blow torch in the sky behind my home which backs up to woods.  It was very overcast and cloudy so nothing could be seen.  This went on for 5-7 minutes.  I heard a plane fly over during this time so you can hear the difference.  It was not a helicopter which we also hear from time to time.  The sound moved away briefly and could still be heard and then returned and stayed for several more minutes and then just stopped. I checked my local neighborhood communication board and there was a similar noise the night before at 10:50pm about 3 miles away.  There was also a similar posting from last April.  I had not seen these postings before.  All were explained as a Rumbling in the sky.  I have several minutes of video.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
