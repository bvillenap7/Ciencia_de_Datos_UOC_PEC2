Strangely behaving Light in the early evening;2010-02-27 20:00:00;5 seconds;Strangely behaving Light in the early evening While driving on hwy 120 going from Discover Mills Mall towards the town of Lawrenceville, a light caught my eye which behaved very strangely.  Firstly, it was not a dot of light.  It seemed larger, and palely lit.  It was circular.  It went up like a flare, and behaved very much like that, however, this was clearly not Fire.  It was just a pale round lit up object.  What happened next was what was strange.  It shot off away from me and across the horizon like a meteor. I’m hoping someone else saw this, and had a better look at it.  I’m guessing there is a normal explanation for it, but the last time I saw something like this was a large meteor, and it was clearly just that, and had pieces of it coming of in the tail. This behaved in a similar manner, but with no tail, or fire-like characteristics whatsoever.  I only saw it for seconds, but it seems like it went up, then off in a different direction.  Very strange.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806

I watched for a few minutes and it never moved.  It was reddish orange and seemed to pulse slightly.   After a few more minutes I looked away for approximately 5-10 seconds because the crowd became excited by a play that happened.   When I looked back the light was gone.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
