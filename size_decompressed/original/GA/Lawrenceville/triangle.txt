A football field size triangular object with a fire-burner on the very back floated, with no sound, over my counsin and my head.;1999-10-25 21:00:00;2 min.;A football field size triangular object with a fire-burner on the very back floated, with no sound, over my counsin and my head. After the football game at the high school in Lawrenceville, GA., my cousin's daughters school, my cousin and I were waiting for her husband to get the car and drive around the very crowded lot to pick us up, I looked up at the sky, as I so often do, and floating above us was dark, like the night sky, triangular object, I'd say at least the size of the football field in length and nearly as wide.  It blocked out the stars, and was low enough that I could see its shape, just like something totally black against a nite sky, ie: just black enough to be darker than the sky. It had absolutely no sound. I said to my cousin, Look at that.  What in the hell is that?  She looked up and said, I don't know.  She seemed less concerned, interested, at the moment as she was watching for her daughter and husband and saying hi to friends from the school, other parents, etc.  I was visiting there.  But I was so in awe of it I kept looking at it.  It just floated over us and all the people leaving the game and over the football field and stands. The back of it had a huge round what I would call like a fire burner that I have seen in the past on the back of fighter jets.  Don't know if those still exists or not, as I haven't seen one in years.  It was round with firelight.  NO SOUND AT ALL, tho, that I could hear.  Even hot air balloons have a kind of swooshing sound as they use the burner, or whatever, to push hot air up into the balloons, which I have heard at the annual balloon race in St. Louis.  I kept calling my cousin's attention to it and she would look up and comment so I know she saw it, and we did talk about it later, but she was preoccupied watching the traffic, etc.  Two things really amazed me---I was incredibly in an awestruck state of mind, and I felt no fear, but alot of curiousity.  AND noone, with all those people around us, seemed to notice or be looking up or anything.  I am amazed that I didn't call out to look at that---but I was so in awe--almost trancelike, tho I was in no tr! ance, observing it in amazement. It drifted off.  I saw no lights on it other than what I call like the big fire red burner on the back of it.
