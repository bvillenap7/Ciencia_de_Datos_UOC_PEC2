Observed very bright green light eye-brow shape move silently across early evening sky.;2006-11-28 18:30:00;5 seconds;Observed very bright green light eye-brow shape move silently across early evening sky. My wife and I were standing on our neighbor's porch waiting for them to come out and drive us to a meeting.  We observed very bright green shape or shapes(s) moving across the clouds at a very high rate of speed without sound.  The shape was eye-brow looking, and we could not tell if it was one or two side-by-side, but may have been masked by the clouds. My wife and I are both in our 50s, professional people, and would be tagged, your basic average everyday neighbor. :);33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
Daylight object at about 20 miles, traveling at 200+ mph, roughly ovoid in shape, metallic color.;2008-04-25 09:48:00;3-4 minutes;Daylight object at about 20 miles, traveling at 200+ mph, roughly ovoid in shape, metallic color. Saw unusual object traveling from SW to NE at about 9:48 AM. Estimated distance of about 10-20 miles. Object appeared silver in color with a slight yellowish cast to it. I estimate it was traveling at 200-400 mph in a steady , straight line. I observed it for approximately 4 minutes. Tried to take several photos but only 3 were in focus enough to actually see any details. Camera was a Nikon Coolpix 8700 (8MB with a 8X optical zoom.)  I have attached the 3 photos that I took.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
9 UFOs seen over Lawrenceville/Grayson area May 19th 2012;2010-05-19 21:00:00;15 - 20 minutes;9 UFOs seen over Lawrenceville/Grayson area May 19th 2012 I was called out to our back deck by my wife to see something she was pointing at. I could see a very bright object coming thru the night sky just above tree-line. My wife was very excited and said one just shot off overhead before the other one got to us.  The object stopped almost in front of us as it pulsated dark orange to light orange.  It seemed to be shaped vertical with 3 evenly spaced enlarged areas.  No sound was heard.  They seemed to move slowly at first but disappeared very quickly.  We were able to watch them for about 15 minutes.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
Strange, unexplainable  blue and red flahing lights with weird force around them. Over 20 seen.;2012-01-18 18:00:00;over 2 hours;Strange, unexplainable  blue and red flahing lights with weird force around them. Over 20 seen. On January 18, 2012 at around 18:00 I saw what I believed to be a UFO. Not necessarily aliens or even a space craft, but I definitely saw allot of objects in the sky at the multiple times sometimes alone, and other times with more than one.  First my friend sitting nest to me outside in a car had seen a strange shooting star in remained in the sky visible for about 10 seconds.  I tried to look, but my vision was blocked by trees.  about 10 minutes later A set of flashing blue and red lights appeared. They were strange but I assumed it was a normal airplane and paid it no attention. This passed by and then about 3 minutes later another plane appears in the same general area. This time I paid more attention to the detail of the plane. I could not tell exactly what the flashing lights were. There was no plane shape near, I could also see a strange Ora or force around the flashing lights as it gradually and steadily moved forward from the lower left middle ! of the horizon at about a 45 degree angle up and across horizontally  towards the  upper right. at first I thought this was a trick of the eye, but as I continued to look, I could clearly see a surrounding area of the sky that was moving with the light, and had a very very slight difference in appearance than the rest of the sky. It was almost like a perfect camouflage with the night sky, it only could be detected with keen attention being paid to a seemingly average airplane in the sky. I observed about 20-30, maybe even 40 objects in the sky within the next 2 hours. I saw multiple shapes. Some were very small and had a similar shape to a blimp, except more rounded and less ovular. I saw large roundish saucer shapes. I saw one that has abrupt square edges. All of there are the shapes of the outer force or Ora around the flashing light. These obects were following each other in the sky. One would be far away and appear as a single light in the lower left distance. A mediu! m sized flashing light would we moving horizontally across fro! m left t o right at about the middle of my line of vision. This medium one was clearly made up of more than one blue and red flashing light. The third flying thing would be towards the upper right on the horizon. you could see the outlining force around it once it reached this point. Also I heard a low humming noise, similar to the sound of a car in neutral except more quiet and muffled. This appearance of one after the other lasted for about 30 minutes. I probably had seen about 20 objects during that time. After 2 hours of watching, I went inside. I peeked out the window several times and have spotted flashing lights at least once every time. Also, A friend from the far end of the neighborhood confirmed the sighting of three bright white lights in triangular form. Another friend in a further neighborhood confirmed the sighting of multiple objects in the sky at once. Several of the objects seen were clearly visible aircrafts but many others with not. I attempted to mkae video footag! e, but my cell phone camera's quality was too poor to capture the lights in the dark.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
9 very bright, deep orange, silent and  pulsating air objects disappear at light speed;2012-05-19 21:00:00;15 minutes;9 very bright, deep orange, silent and  pulsating air objects disappear at light speed May 19, 2012 at approx 2100 I walked outside my home and looked up in the sky. Just above tree-top level and approx 1/2 mile away, I saw a very bright deep orange pulsating light that appeared to be a 3 tiered row of lights surrounding a verticle object. This object in the sky was about 1/2 mile away from my property but appeared to be as large as 1/2 or full football field. The object sat motionless briefly, and no sound at all. As I realized the enormity of what I was looking at, I started yelling to my family to come outside and tell me what was in the sky. As 2 other family members arrived on the deck, a second object was seen approaching from the north, very low on the horizon, could be seen between trees. It traveled in a straight line from about 4 miles away in 4 seconds. The first object shot upward to the right at about a 45 degree angle to completely disappear in 2.5 seconds. As the second object reached the exact same location as the first, anothe! r could be seen approaching from the left. Two other family members joined us at that time. The second object shot upward also at the speed of light to be gone in 2.5 seconds. This continued for 6 more times exactly the same each. As we stood in silence looking and listening, each of us were astonished at what we had witnessed and began talking about the light show. Approximately 3 minutes went by and a family member said look... here comes another one. #9 object followed exact path and slowed over us while pulsating (much like a heart beat)then followed all the other objects in the sky at a 45 degree angle. The night sky was completely clear, warm, quiet. Not even my 5 dogs barked. No airplanes or helicopters were seen before or after for about 20 minutes. Only the usual night time airplanes were in the distance.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
Double Columns of light in lawrenceville, ga  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible contrails??  PD));2012-11-09 17:00:00;15 minutes;Double Columns of light in lawrenceville, ga At approximately 1700 hrs on the evening of 9 November 2012, this person and his wife were exiting Sugarloaf Mills Mall when the two of them saw what appeared to be two very large columns of light side by side in the West/Northwestern sky.  The lights appeared not to be reflections, but emanating from whatever the craft was itself.  They looked perhaps like the fire one would see from a jet propulsion engine, but they were vertical rectangular/cylindrical in shape.  No trail, as one would see with a con-trail from an airplane, was left.   The two witnesses thought perhaps it was the international space station, although it looked to be too large and too close to be so.   It drifted slowly from the West/Northwestern sky to the Northern sky as its distance became greater.   The two witnesses watched as the craft went between the clouds and the horizon, in front of the clouds, so the two witnesses realized it must not be anything too far in the sky.  It appeared to be flaming, as a comet would.   As it drifted further away, the two witnesses conferred that it could still be seen at a distance of at least fifteen miles. END REPORT.

We saw reddish-orange orb-like round lights about the size of softballs in the sky moving at a low altitude in two distinct groups of 5;2013-10-18 21:33:00;3 minutes;We saw reddish-orange orb-like round lights about the size of softballs in the sky moving at a low altitude in two distinct groups of 5 to 7.  The first lead “vehicle” was more in the shape of a triangle or diamond with orange/red/white lights on the points.  Following on behind were orb shaped things that looked like balls of fire.  They were not meteors.  They were moving west to east in a distinct pattern and flying very low, just a bit above the treetops. When I finally got my mind straight I started taking photos but when the flash of the camera went off several times they made a very sharp left, not a left that an aircraft could make and then disappeared from the sky. Once the first group went disappeared another group came along behind it 30 to 40 seconds later and where in the very same pattern as the first with no jet or motor sounds at all – everything was totally quiet during the whole time. After all this happened we viewed the photos and the orbs showed up white on the photos although what we were looking at was very much reddish/orange. As my daughter left the subdivision she noticed others outside taking photos.  So we were not the only ones to see this happening.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
