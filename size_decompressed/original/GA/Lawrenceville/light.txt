A UFO over Lawrenceville, GA travelling due South which faded as it crossed the sky, followed by an aircraft.;2005-12-03 05:45:00;5 minutes;A UFO over Lawrenceville, GA, travelling due South which faded as it crossed the sky, followed by an aircraft. Once spotted, the white, star-looking object was about 10-15 degrees South of my Zenith in Lawrenceville, GA.  The UFO was travelling the exact direction away from me, due South.  It's magnatude was around 2.0 (about the same magnatude as the stars in Ursa Major).  As the UFO continued south, it's magnitude diminished.  The UFO was no longer visible at about 20-30 degrees above the horizon.  When I could no longer see the UFO I spotted an aircraft that sounded like a commercial airliner.  The aircraft was travelling at the same speed(from my viewpoint) and parallel to the UFO.  The aircraft was about 5 degrees East of the UFO's trejectory, and also lagged the UFO anywhere from 40-50 degrees.  Both the aircraft and the UFO travelled in a straight path.  At 23 years old, I am an amateur astronomer who has always taken an interest in looking at the stars.  I became extremely dedicated to observing about 2 years ago, which is when I was trialling a nice pair of binoculars to see if I wanted to invest in a telescope.  Currently I own 2 refracting (60mm & 70mm) scopes and 1 reflecting (130mm) telescope.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
Moving green light split into two then disappeared;2013-02-14 23:23:00;5 seconds;Moving green light split into two then disappeared There was a huge green light (first seemed like a helicopter) that seemed to hover slowly to the west which then split into 2 smaller green lights.  After it split into two, the lights disappeared.  The huge green light didn't blink or flash and it looked like a teardrop moving sideways.

((HOAX??)) I was sitting outside in my driveway, and I see a red light/dot coming out from the tree line, it raised, then stopped.;2016-05-08 21:40:00;5-10 minutes;I was sitting outside in my driveway, and I see a red light/dot coming out from the tree line, it raised, then stopped, and did that until it just stopped.  And I freaked out if course.   It hovered there for around five to ten minutes, then slowly lowered back to the tree line. You could see two separate dots, but really close together.

Bright white light over Lawrenceville/North Georgia;2016-08-11 21:30:00;2-5 minutes;Bright white light over Lawrenceville/North Georgia I glanced up and noticed the object in the sky, tracking from west to east. From my vantage point it was in the ladle of the Big Dipper.  It was quite bright, pure white light.   At first I thought it was a helicopter.  It stopped moving and grew intensely bright.  I was looking for the flashing navigation light on the tail rotor (if it was a helicopter) and did not see any, nor could I hear the chopping of the air.  It was so bright that it hurt my eyes. After about a minute like this it began to dim.  As it dimmed it began to track north, becoming more dim as it picked up speed.   I kept my eyes on it until I lost it in the haze of light pollution.  By the time I lost sight it was moving quite fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
