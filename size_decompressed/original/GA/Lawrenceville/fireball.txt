It stop flashing disappeared moved to the right and started flashing again.  Really far out, could easily be mistaken for a flashing star.   At some point I saw another pair of red flashining lights go really fast flying to the left.  I'm a bit direction challenged but I'd say the flashing one was moving towards the south and the other one north.

White star-like object grew larger, dropped, disappeared, reappeared, and continued dropping until gone.;2017-07-13 12:33:00;10 seconds;White Star-like object grew larger, dropped, disappeared, reappeared, and continued dropping until gone. I was in my car with my son and was able to see a bright star-like shaped light just above and to the right of an easily noticed plane flying by.  I initially thought it was a bright star until it instantly grew bigger, as if it was moving forward while it became even brighter.   Suddenly, it dropped straight down while growing a little larger and seemed to disappear for a couple of seconds re-appear in the same place.  This object then continued to drop in the night sky until it disappeared as if to have landed someplace. My son confirmed seeing the same as I saw and we could not believe it.  We compared possibilities to agree this was not normal and, definitely, no falling star. We are still at awe and my son is an adult too.  We immediately had to get online to find possible reports posted.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
