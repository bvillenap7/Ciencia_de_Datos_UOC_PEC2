Spotted strange tubular shaped cloud about 2 PM ,and took several photos (8). Afterwards , while examining the photos I didcovered 2 small dark objects nearby and, in one photo, a brilliant blue orb. The cloud object seemed to move into and then through the other clouds.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
Silent white capsule-shaped object seen over Lawrenceville, GA;2011-07-23 19:30:00;4-5 minutes;Silent white capsule-shaped object seen over Lawrenceville, GA I was out walking, about 7:30 in the evening, but there was still plenty of daylight.  A flock of birds caught my attention, and behind the flock of birds, in the distance, I see what I originally thought was an airplane.  I watched it, not because it was doing anything interesting, but because it was in my line of sight.   As it came closer, I couldn't see any wings, and so continued to watch it, to see if it was jet plane, or a propeller plane, whatever... just idle curiosity.  So I watch this thing coming closer to me, which is completely silent, by the way, and notice as it gets closer that there's no wings, no tail... no nothing.   It looked like a white Tylenol gelcap, complete with a thick black seam down the middle.  I stop walking completely at this point, this thing has my full attention now.  It's to the south of me, and passes at a slight diagonal from my left to my right (east-by-southeast to north-by-northwest), moving at a pretty good clip, not mak! ing any turns...still silent...steady speed and altitude and then disappears behind some trees.   SOMEWHERE within that 4-5 minutes while I was watching it, and my viewpoint changed as it moved, I should have seen wings or a tail.  Or a cockpit, or windows.  I see nothing, except the black seam in the middle of it.  I realize I should have taken a picture with my cell phone, but by the time my brain kicks in and tells me that that really ISN'T a plane I'm looking at, it's already over the trees to my west and it's too late.  So now I'm looking for fighter jets flying after it, or Fox Mulder lurking in the bushes, but nothing.  It was no zeppelin, the shape was wrong and it moved too quickly.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
I saw one metallic colored, cigar shaped object, comparable to the size and shape of a commercial passenger aircraft, but had no wings.;2014-09-21 13:00:00;1 minute;I saw one metallic colored, cigar shaped object, comparable to the size and shape of a commercial passenger aircraft, but had no wings.  My friends heard me say an expletive word, and saw me looking up.  He saw it too.  Moving slower than a plane but not as slow as a blimp. I just don't understand how this was able to stay airborne going that slow, with no wings. I told my friend to take a picture with cell phone.  The first vessel was gone by now, but I told him to snap a few pictures anyway...   Then another craft came, heading south in direction of first craft.  He took three pictures, and said he saw the craft in his phone when he took the picture but they did not show up when we looked at them later.  This definantly was not a plane, blimp, or someone's toys.  I understand we aren't supposed to give our name or contact info, but I'm sure y'all can trace this back to me.  Please, can u tell me what this was?  Thank u;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
Small dark shadowy figure with no lights, moving quickly in the light of the moon and shaped like a fat cigar with 2 small fins.;2018-10-19 22:55:00;5 seconds;Small dark shadowy figure with no lights, moving quickly in the light of the moon and shaped like a fat cigar with 2 small fins. UFO occurrence  Tonight, around 10:55 pm, I saw a strange dark object gliding in the sky.  It had no lights what so ever. I live in the suburbs of a large city several miles away.  There is some light distraction causing the inability to see all the stars, typical.  There were thin and high altitude clouds moving across about a 3 quarter moon.  I could still see the moon brightly through the thin layer of clouds creating a silhouette of sorts.  I often look up to Southern sky in an opening space of 70 feet or so, between some tall pines. As I looked up to see the moon, I also noticed how fast the clouds were moving, mostly from West to East.  I was only gazing up for about 15 to 20 seconds, when very quickly, small shadow type object, moved East to West just below the moon.  I only saw it for about 4 to 5 seconds.  It was the oddest thing.  It no lights on it at all.  And probably, I would’ve notice it at all if it did not fly across the lower and bright silhouette of the moon.  It actually took about 20 seconds for me register in my mind what I actually saw or didn’t see. There is a busy airport several miles away and often I see high airplane traffic.  I also use to practically live under a landing line of an airport for years.  I know the difference between an airplane at night or something else.  This was definitely something else. To summarize, I saw a small dark or shadow type object, moving east to west.  It appeared to be high in the sky as a solid object.  I could not differentiate whether the object was above or below the thin fast moving clouds.  Perhaps, the only reason I saw it, was by the light of the moon.  The object was probably only 1/32 the size of the moon.  Considering the short period of time, I viewed the object, I can recall it being the shape of a laid-down fat-in-middle cigar with a small fin on top and bottom of the back-end and not a long object.;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
