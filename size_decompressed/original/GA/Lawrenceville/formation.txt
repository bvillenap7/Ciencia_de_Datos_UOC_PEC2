9 or 10 lights in perfect (silent) formation in a trapazoid pattern moving around 30 mph in front of us at approx 500  feet above us.;2003-10-04 19:58:00;3 minutes;9 or 10 lights in perfect (silent) formation in a trapazoid pattern moving around 30 mph in front of us at approx 500  feet above us. Object(s) moving approx 30 mph just in front of our car. Formation took up 1/3 of front windshield of Rav4 -approx 500 to 1000 feet off ground. Very large! Very distinct unchanging pattern of white lights moving silently in front of us. We stopped and got out of the car but could not hear any noise whatsoever. The far left light was blinking on and off (slowly) - all others were bright and unchanging. The formation that we witnessed matches almost exactly with a previously reported incident in Phoenix, Arizona in 1997 (reference Dr. Lynne D. Kitei)which, when I saw the exact pattern (as re-created on the television documentary) prompted me to write this report as there are no pictures. Object(s) remained in view for approx 3 minutes as it continued to move in front of our location in a Norherly direction- we ran out of roadway in which to follow it further. The location of this sighting corresponds to the intersection of Web Ginn Road and Moon Place and was first viewed between Moon Place and Ronald Reagan Parkway (about 1/2 way between these two roads and moving parallel to Web Ginn road before it turns to the right at the intersection of Moon Place. My daughter drew what she saw in the lower half of a piece of paper. I then drew a picture of what I saw on the upper half of the paper (without looking at her drawing first) and then we compared the two drawings. This is included in this report along with a painting she made (also from memory) for my birthday the following month as a memory of what we saw. She also wrote at the bottom of the painting Some things are just not to be said... or explained...;33.9653628140704;-84.0137432160806
