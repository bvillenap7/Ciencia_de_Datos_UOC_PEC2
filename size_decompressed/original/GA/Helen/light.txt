Straight line across the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-26 22:00:00;5 minutes;Started by us noticing the beautiful clearly lit sky full of stars.  Moments later, looked up to see a beam in the sky a very distinctive straight line across the night sky.  At first it looked like an after glow of a shooting star.  Along this straight line were orbs or lights traveling single file one behind the other.  The orbs or lights varied in intensity.  It looked to me as if something coming or going.  Many object in this sighting traveling together in a energy beam, I have never witnessed anything remotely like this? ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));34.6866;-83.7399
