Triangle shaped ship over Georgia in the 1980's.;1986-09-01 00:00:00;about 5 minutes;Triangle shaped ship over Georgia in the 1980's. I do not have any idea what month, or day this happened, as I was a little girl, but it had to be during the months school is in session, because I told my best friend the next day.  No one talked about such things back then, especially in the narrow minded south. I woke from a sound sleep in the middle of the night, and sensed something.  My windows were high on the wall of my bedroom, so I stood on the bed to look outside. There, hovering over the woods next to my house, was a triangle shaped ship.  It had lights that ran along all 3 sides, outlining its shape.  It was at a distance of less than 3 tenths of a mile.  I watched it, too afraid that if I looked away, it would disappear, for several minutes, until I lost the feeling in my feet.  Then, it did an almost instant 180 degree turn and shot off into the night.  Traveling east to southeast, I guess.  It made NO sound, but there was that kind of sensation you get from something that you don't so much hear as feel. I turned on all the lights and refused to go back to sleep, to ensure that I had not dreamed the whole thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
