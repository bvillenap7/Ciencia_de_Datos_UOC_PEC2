After star gazing, me and my dad were packing up my telescope when a circular flying object came floating by.  We thought it was a plane at first but it was making no noise and then we realized it was only about 200 feet from the ground.  It was too dark to make out what it was put the lights on it were flashing in a circular shape.  When it came into the moonlight it was no longer circular but square. I thought it was a kite and I thought I saw a string but that could not be true because it floated miles away over a river with no one following it.  We thought it could have been a balloon but it was moving much to fast and there was no wind blowing.  It was also to dark to take pictures.;34.1137999999993;-83.9991000000008
