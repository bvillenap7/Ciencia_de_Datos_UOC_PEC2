Three orange orbs in night sky.;2017-05-29 21:00:00;20 minutes;Three Orange Orbs in Night Sky Driving into my neighborhood and saw 3 neighbors looking at the sky. I looked up and saw three very bright, orange orbs in the sky, sort of in a line.  Not a straight line, more of a loose scalene triangle.  2 of the orbs were much brighter than the 3rd.  They didn't move. I went inside my house and came back out 15 minutes later.  The fainter orb was less visible but the three orbs were now closer together, forming more of a typical triangle.  I drove back past my neighbors who said they tried to look at the orbs through binoculars but the orbs were too fuzzy. As I left my neighborhood, I looked up and it appeared that the orbs were moving quickly away.  I tried to locate them again 2 minutes later when I turned toward the direction they came from, but they were gone.;34.1137999999993;-83.9991000000008
