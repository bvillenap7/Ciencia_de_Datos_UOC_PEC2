Comet like fireball;2014-05-15 21:30:00;30 seconds;Comet like fireball I'm pretty sure it was a meteor, but it was very slow moving.  It came up from the tree lines to the right of the road very suddenly, and I thought it was a firework, but it hit the point in the sky that it looked like it would descend or blow up, but it them moved to the left across the road in a slow straight line.  Giving off a tale very much like a comet does, except you could see it seem to be breaking apart and leaving a beautiful trail behind it, it then disappeared behind the trees on the other side of the road.  But it seemed almost too low in the sky that when I was driving under it it did not seem much higher than the trees it just flew over.  That sky was dark, the moon had not come up yet, and it was actually beautiful.;34.1029365591396;-83.9783361290328
A orange/ yellow fireball  going across the sky from a slow/steady moving object over Buford Ga .;2015-05-30 21:00:00;2 minutes;A orange/ yellow fireball  going across the sky from a slow/steady moving object over Buford Ga . We were sitting on the deck, enjoying the evening, when we looked up and noticed a object with a fireball glowing orange and yellow.  It was moving slow and steady across the sky.   As we watched it top the tree line across the street the fireball flame seem to go out.  A dark object could still be seen moving as it disappeared above the trees.   A minute or so later we saw the same thing appear again coming from the same direction as the first one.  Again with a orange yellow fireball.   There was no sound to be heard.
