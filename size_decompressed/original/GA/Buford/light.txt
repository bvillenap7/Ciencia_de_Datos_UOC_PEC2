Red lights over Buford, GA.;2013-06-14 21:40:00;10 minutes;Red lights over Buford, GA. At approximately 2130 tonight I received a call from a co worker to come outside and look at the sky. I went outside and seen about 10 round glowing red lights that would change to yellow but with some red still in them. They were coming from the east flying over I85 towards I985 then flickering out behind clouds over Buford but not showing up again. Except for 2 that we saw to the west of us that disappeared quickly. However, several more kept coming from the east. I would say I witnessed at least 5-8 more lights that came from the east after the initial 10. These objects did not make any sound. My coworker said there were probably 20 more he saw before I made it outside. There were several aircraft in the sky as well, but none as close to us. These aircraft were distinguishable as they had the typical white flickering light that normal aircraft have. I have film on my phone of the last 3 or 4 of these lights. You can see the lights but barely on my phone.;34.1029365591396;-83.9783361290328
