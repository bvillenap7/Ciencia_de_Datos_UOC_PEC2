NOT A UFO!;2005-07-07 23:07:00;3 minutes;NOTE: THIS WAS NOT A UFO! It was a Stealth aircraft, but I wanted to alert the center in case of sightings related to this craft under mistaken identity. I was taking my trash to the curb in my subdivision which is in a residential/agricultural community. Coming from NE to SW is a regular flight path for commercial aircraft coming into and leaving Hartsfield in Atlanta so the distant lights and noise are normal to me at all hours. We also have a local airfield in Lawrenceville, GA which accommodates helos and twin-engine craft for the private as well as business sector. However when I first took the bin to the curb I noticed in a more northerly direction a rather intense bright white light twice the size of the North Star usually seen. I stared at it for a moment then returned to get the recycling bin which took perhaps 30 seconds at most. When I looked up again the 'light' had become a huge light within a vast black 'triangle' to include a slowly flashing red light and green light in the respective lower corner angles. In the middle and slightly into the craft was a very swiftly flashing red light. I'm really bad as far as judging distance so here goes my method: Holding my hand up at arms length, and pinching the object = the commercial jets way up are about 1/4 but this craft was about 3! So it was very close to earth in flight. And it was totally silent! I watched it go over the roof of my house in the normal flight route and ran to the back to watch it disappear over the treeline to the SW about 30 degrees more than the commercial flight paths. My husband is in the Navy so I called him before getting excited about a UFO. He told me it was a Stealth Aircraft probably heading out toward Texas. He couldn't elaborate on anything further and I understood. I have had only one other encounter with a triangular object such as this and when I explained that one to him, he said it was most definitely NOT a Stealth aircraft! I shall report that incident next although it took place in MA back in the early 90's. I just wanted to let you know that if anyone reported this object from the past week. I would also appreciate the confidentiality of the Stealth flight pattern as it is a matter of national security...just wanted to alert you to mistaken reporting. Thank you!;34.1029365591396;-83.9783361290328
What is a red triangle under the left arm mean?;2008-06-06 00:00:00;15 mins;What is a red triangle under the left arm mean?   I was having trouble sleeping. After tossing and turning, I just turn on my back and looked up at the ceiling. I have a one room appartment. My bed is next to the kitchen. I notice a triangle shape light object on the ceiling next to me ( 3 feet away). I imediately looked for reflections or light comming in through the window - then I pinch myself to see if I was awake. I was!! The inside of the triangle was moving. I watched. At the cornors, the smalliest white light came on. A question was asked of me. I answered. Then one corner turn red and I went to sleep. When I awoke , the was a red pin point triangle under my left arm. I took a picture and it showed other marks. (not red) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
