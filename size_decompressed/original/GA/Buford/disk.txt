I am a War vet stationend on the USS Coral Sea from 1973 to 1976 ,I worked on the flight deck as an ABF ,So I know a little about aircraft.What I saw was not an aircraft of military or civlian origin.Only the passenger in the right side front of the car saw the craft.The driver said he did not see it.;34.1029365591396;-83.9783361290328
