At first he thought it was a star, but he called me outside to look at it and it at first looked like a star but it was so bright in the sky and in a location where we have never seen a star like that.   I got the binoculars to look at it but it must have been far away because I could not make much out except at times it looked like many tiny lights (kind of like a fireworks configuration) through the binoculars, but it looked like one light without the binoculars.   We don't know what it was.   I went outside about 2 hours later and it was not there.;34.1029365591396;-83.9783361290328
Strange non-alian aircraft above buford ga.;2012-12-06 00:30:00;5 minutes;Strange non-alien aircraft above buford ga. A friend and I were sitting in my living room when we heard an engine whine sound outside.  I told him I had heard it before, but had never seen it due to its only at night and always above the cloud cover.  We went outside to see an object with lights on it in the sky, this time flying no more than 100ft above the tree tops.  My friend said it was a helicopter at which time I told him to listen closely. no chopping could be heard once it came into view.   It sounded more like a hover craft. the chopping was due to the sound bouncing off of the other houses as it was approaching. the lights at the tail end of plane were consistent proper aviation code, green and red. the light at the front of the aircraft was white as if a spot light, but did not project itself to the ground. it lite up the sky in front of the craft as well as the tree tops in a wide fashion.  Both me and my friend agreed this was nothing like anything we had ever seen or heard about.  Maybe someon! e there knows something.;34.1029365591396;-83.9783361290328
Green, red & white alternating lights hovering and moving horizontally and vertically.;2014-05-03 23:10:00;5 minutes;Green, red & white alternating lights hovering and moving horizontally and vertically. We observed an object with oscillating green and red lights (similar to navigation lights but very different than anything we've ever seen) rising and falling vertically for a period of 5 minutes in a northeasterly direction from Holiday Marina at Lake Lanier, Buford, GA. When we first noticed the object, it appeared very high in the sky and was a stationary red light.  It didn't appear to move for 20-30 seconds after we noted it.  The object then began to descend and alternated a couple of times between green and red light.  The object appeared to float in an unusual hover pattern and then randomly moved (very quickly horizontally before returning to its ascending and descending pattern.  The light would periodically switch from red-green and then to white. The object climbed and descended a range of  20-30 degrees on our horizon at an indeterminate distance, but at least several miles away.  It appeared to be the ‘type’ of maneuvering a helicopter might make, however we have never seen a helicopter appear to move in that manner.  It was almost floating and then would go straight up/straight down very slow, then very fast.  Sideways also.  It finally disappeared below the horizon.;34.1029365591396;-83.9783361290328
