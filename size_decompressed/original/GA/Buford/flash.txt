strobing lights appear near mall of georgia, go on for hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Possible hoax.  PD));2007-10-22 01:00:00;4+ hours;Strobing lights appear near mall of georgia, go on for hours. Around 10 PM on october 21, my sister and I were driving home to my dads house in buford, near the mall of georgia, and on a road we have traveled countless times, up ahead we saw nothing that we have seen before when driving.    about a mile ahead of us, in what appeared to be a field, were strobing lights. the bottom one from our vantage was about the size of a mcdonalds sign, and this was from a distance. and above it was a slightly smaller one, and then a smaller one.   and they were strobing, the bottom would flash then the middle then top. and we looked around in the sky and saw dozens of small pinpoint sized white flashing dots, all over the place. and they werent moving, they were all sitting still and flashing.    then when we get home, we looked around where our house was and could see nothing.   then at about 12:30 or 1 am on october 22nd i looked out my window and saw in the distance the same thing, but could only see the top two strobing circles, and off to the left of them about 50 feet apart was another flashing circle, but it was much smaller and much less bright.   and it keeps blinking in succession with each other. it was high above the furthest house we could see, and it slowly sunk down lower, and finally settled at the location it is at now. i never actually saw it stop, but i fell asleep around 2 am and woke up around 4:30, still saw them there, then fell back asleep until about 8 am, and couldnt see them anymore.   then at around 2 am october 23rd i looked out my window and saw nothing there, so i went to sleep.   well tonight, technically the morning of october 24th, it is almost 2 am and i looked out my window before heading to bed and there they are again, same place they were two nights ago, doing the same pattern.   i have searched for news of something going on around here, but have found nothing.   im not exactly sure what this is, but i would like to find out.
