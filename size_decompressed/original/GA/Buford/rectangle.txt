4 craft in Buford, Georgia;2007-01-03 23:15:00;3 minutes;4 craft in Buford, Georgia My friends and I were driving to my aunt's home from a sporting event on Highway 20, when one of the girls in the backseat pointed to the right and told us to look. There were four, rectangular craft flying pretty close to the ground. They were changing colors every few seconds all over their surface, except for a central, dark spot. We pulled over into a parking lot and got out of the car. They would zoom ahead and then slow down, often retracing where they had just flown. The traffic was really light, and we couldn't hear them making any noise, and we were pretty close to them. Then, they broke their formation suddenly and went in different directions, dousing thier lights suddenly.  We drove away.
