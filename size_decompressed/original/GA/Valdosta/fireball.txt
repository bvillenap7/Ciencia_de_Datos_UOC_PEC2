Fast bright fireball that changed directions.;2013-07-05 21:30:00;3 minutes;Fast bright fireball that changed directions. We saw a bright illuminating object.  It was far away but looked like it was slowly coming toward us.  Then it turned right suddenly.  After it turned right it picked up a little speed.  After a few more seconds of going that same direction, it very quickly left the atmosphere.  It looked like a house shaped fireball.

Green meteor crashes into Valdosta.;2014-06-09 20:30:00;5 seconds;Green meteor crashes into valdosta I was driving on the highway, after leaving the theme park, when I saw a giant green flame go across the sky and strike around where the university is located.  I thought I was seeming a meteor or weapon landing and braced myself for contact tremors, or fire and wind like you see in movies.  Nothing happened and I looked around at other vehicles they seem to continue normally.   The next day I saw nor heard anything in the news and to this day I know what I saw, but I'm not sure what I witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.
