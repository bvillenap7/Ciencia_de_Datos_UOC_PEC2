I observed directly overhead just above tree top an Chevron shaped Aircraft with no fuseluge (No it wasn't a Stealth) pass ever so slowly above us.  I could make out two rows of lights on the bottom of the wings (eight lights each row) white light almost recessed into the wings.  The object made very little noise it was not engine noise neither was their any vapor tail.  Across the road (Rte 7) was the north end of Moody AFB, and F4 (D) Phantom jets were making their approach to the flight line, this object headed directly towards those landing F4's.  I was half expecting some collision but the Chevron object flew directly above the F4's and amazingly the F4's never aborted or broke from their landing approach.  The above craft was about 40 foot long. My background at that time I was 22 years old, sober and a Senior Airman enlisted in the Air Force at Moody AFB, located at Valdosta GA. Today I am a Senior Debug Techician up in Massachusetts, (Won't mention company name).  The object was Chevron shaped. Not pointed on the ends but rounded.;30.8769975247525;-83.3023014851486
