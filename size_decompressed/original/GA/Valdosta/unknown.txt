Constant green light, flying south over Gerogia.;2009-12-29 20:40:00;2 secs;Constant green light, flying south over Georgia. Me and my sons saw a low flying green light traveling south and appeared to be flying, 300-600 feet.  The light was constant (no blinking) and disappeared from view as soon as we reached a clearing in the direction it was traveling.  No sound could be heard, though it was cold and we were traveling with the windows up. Only the light could be seen, so a description of the object is unknown.   Our background was a clear and cold night sky with a full moon in the 11:00 position. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
