Round object with red and white blinking lights. It moves around a little bit in the sky. There is no noise coming from it.;2013-07-30 01:00:00;half hour;Round object with red and white blinking lights. It moves around a little bit in the sky. There is no noise coming from it. I have been seeing this object in the night sky for about a month now.  I stand in my back yard and look up in between the trees.  I see a round object that moves and flashes red and white lights.  It also stays in one spot for a few minutes. I had my flash light with me one night and moved it back and forth in the air.  The object moved in sink with my flash light. It stops moving for a few minutes then starts moving again. I haven't seen  it for the past few nights but just saw it tonight a few minutes ago while I was out side having a cigarette. It's not a star nor a planet because it moves around with the blinking lights.  It's not an airplane either.  But, I have seen airplanes fly by this object.  I tried one night last week to get it on video using my camcorder.  I did catch it on video but it's not too clear and my hand was shaking a bit. It appears in the same area of the sky, between two trees in my back yard each time.  I'm pretty sure it sees my flash light as it seems to move a little while I shine my flash light at it.  I don't know if it is from Moody AFB as the base isn't all that far away from here.  But, it doesn't look like an airplane.;30.8769975247525;-83.3023014851486
Burnt-orange sphere lights in Valdostsa/Clyattville.;2014-08-13 22:00:00;8 seconds;Burnt orange sphere lights in Valdostsa/Clyattville. I was driving down white water rd when I spotted a bundle of burnt orange lights over the field at first I didn't pay much attention I assumed it was planes due to the fact they are always in the are.   But the closer I got the more I became confused as to what it all together it was about roughly 22 or so lights   I was trying to get closer to make out what it was but then it was like some had shut of the light switch and as soon as that happened it was a flash of red.

Small ball of white light moving very fast across the sky with no sound or contrail;2021-04-13 23:30:00;10 seconds;Small ball of white light moving very fast across the sky with no sound or contrail On April 13th 2021 at around 10:30 PM I was out on my back porch sky gazing when I saw a small round light moving from the southwest toward the northeast much faster than an airliner say at 33,000 feet.  Based on an airliner speed of 400-450 knots at altitude moving across the night sky, I would estimate this object was moving close to 1200 knots.  I’ve seen what a satellite looks like moving across the sky, but this object was nearly 4 times the size of what a very small satellite looks like in the sky.  They are very difficult to see.  This was very easy to see.  I don’t believe it was a satellite.  There was no sound associated with it, no anti-collision lights, nor a contrail and it flew in a straight line northeasterly and dimmed out of view.;30.8769975247525;-83.3023014851486
