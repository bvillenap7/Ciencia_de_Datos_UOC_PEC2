This aircraft was going faster than our truck and had a halo around it, plus a vapor trail very simular to the tail of a comet. I called it to my wife's attention and she replied that she had never seen such a craft. Suddenly it appeared to stop, but then it got very small with no vapor trail. As it disappeared we both realized it had gone into deep space. I know of no human aircraft that can perform such as this vehicle. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of several reports submitted by same source.  PD));30.8769975247525;-83.3023014851486

Happens every night, round objects that move around. Just about the same area every night as well.;2013-08-05 22:01:00;10 minutes;Happens every night, round objects that move around. Just about the same area every night as well. I went out last night to have a cigarette. I was looking up a the sky and saw 2 round objects.  They were in circular form, moving around the night sky.  One was moving back and forth, the second one only moved a little also back and forth. I lit my cigarette lighter, waved it back and forth then put the flame out.  They seemed to respond to it.  They both moved around, one went behind a tree to where I could hardly see it. This goes on every night just about the same time as well. I have been seeing one every night.  But, last night there were 2 of them. It seems to me they are curious as to what the flame is on my lighter as that's when they start to move around. I have tried using my camcorder to film them but I can't hold the camera still.;30.8769975247525;-83.3023014851486
My friend and I saw the same orbs of lights from opposite ends of a entire city.;2017-02-09 05:15:00;0:0:20;My friend and I saw the same orbs of lights from opposite ends of a entire city. At about 7:15-7:20 a friend and I saw what appeared to be an orange/golden orb.  When that orb disappeared, three more appeared and formed what could be best described as a diagonal shape.  All within a span of 15-20 seconds, before all lights disappeared at the same time.   NOTE:  My friend and I live on opposite ends of the city and live about 10-15 minutes of each other.  I called Moody Air Force base and they told me that it was a plane (we all know that's not true).  I couldn't hear anything coming out of the objects at the time.;30.8769975247525;-83.3023014851486

The radar signal showed the clouds changing as if a pebble was tossed into a still pond. The radiating waves from the object caused the radar or the clouds to ripple out in a circle.;30.8769975247525;-83.3023014851486
