A small dark triagle object traveling at a high rate of speed;2001-09-21 12:00:00;A few seconds;A small dark triagle object traveling at a high rate of speed On Sept. 21, 2001 about 12:00P.M. my brother-in-law and I were at the river fishing.  We noticed quite a few buzzards swarming.  We were staring at the sky talking about why they were swarming in the area.  Then suddenly just above the tree tops we saw a small dark triagle shaped object(about the size of a compact car) traveling at a extreme rate of speed.  It was not making any noise just the sound of it breaking through the wind.  This was like no other object we have ever seen before.  We were very upset over this sighting due to all the terrorist activity. ((NUFORC Note:  Source remains anonymous.  PD));30.8769975247525;-83.3023014851486
