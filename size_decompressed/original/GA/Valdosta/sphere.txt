The object was small, round and glowing a golden white. It was roughly the size of a softball. After failing to identify the object, I pressed record. Upon doing so, the object moved to the opposite side of a vehicle, leaving a tail indicative of its flight path across the windshield. It made this maneuver within a single frame. I'm hoping to find someone capable of estimating the speed of the anomaly using the footage I managed to capture.;30.8769975247525;-83.3023014851486
