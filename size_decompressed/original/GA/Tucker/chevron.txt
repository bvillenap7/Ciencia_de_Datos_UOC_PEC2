Flying wing spotted in Atlanta;2003-01-16 07:30:00;30 seconds;Flying wing spotted in Atlanta At 7:30am I received a call from a friend, who excitedly urged me to go outside to see the paths the normal jet traffic was clearing through a low level cloud bank.  It was amazing to see a narrow swath of clear sky showing through the clouds as several jets passed overhead, and burned away a clear path. This alone was a phenomenon that I had never witnessed in 54 years. But, as I was watching is facination, I saw what looked like a shadow moving through the cloud bank from north to south.  The shadow was the shape of a flying wing . I desparately tried to get my friend to see what I was seeing, but was unsuccessful. Although the object appeared as if a shadow, it could not have been, insomuch as, it was approx. 5 degrees from the vertical, and the sun was less than 5 degrees from the horizontal. I have no idea what the object was, but it was there, and it will remain unforgettable!;33.8595644859813;-84.2158831775702
A sideways boomerang-shaped UFO was visible above La Vista Road for about ten seconds.;2009-02-22 19:45:00;about 10 seconds;A sideways boomerang-shaped UFO was visible above La Vista Road for about ten seconds. While driving down La Vista Road, I looked out my window at the sky to see a very strange object.  It was moving at about the speed of a helicopter, and it was shaped like a boomerang. It appeared to be moving sideways.  It was pretty low to the ground, at about the height of an airplane about to land. There were lights running along the perimeter of it, from what I could see.  I could only look at it for about ten seconds before it disappeared from my view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
