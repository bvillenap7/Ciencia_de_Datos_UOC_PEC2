I saw a small group of lights floating slowly very high up in the air in a northeast direction. I was standing in a parking lot with one other person. As time passed the object changed shape as if it were an amorphous blob floating across the sky. I noticed this because I looked up to see what was making a loud noise and saw two military helicopters fly by travelling southeast. I noticed the blob at the same time. The blob was a group of small white lights. Then I saw what looked like a shooting star starting slightly east of the object. It went over the object and dissappeared and then the object itself faded away. I am a 24 year old married female and the other witness is an 18 year old male. We both work for a delivery service.  I think the shooting star was the object as it was leaving because immediately after i saw the shooting star the object faded away.;33.8595644859813;-84.2158831775702
