I was at work on break,and I looked over the tree tops.And high above them I saw a redish orange ball of light on what seemed to be a vertical flight patteren.Its movements were strange because it moved in a up and down motion real fast but it did not go a fare distance.The speed it moved through my eyes off on it's accual shape it was most likely round.It was a very clear night the star's were bright,and it appeard to be the same seize as the closes star's.It was not of our world in my opinion,a strange feeling came over my for days after I saw it.I still cant explain what it was,sometimes I really dont want to know.you could not see through it and it was not real bright.maybe someone knows, what it is, but I truely can only call it a ufo.

A UFO was seen overhead changing shape and making my cellphone turn off.;2009-02-11 22:30:00;1 minute;A UFO was seen overhead changing shape and making my cellphone turn off. I was driving north in the middle of Columbus, GA on Wednesday, February 11, 2009 at 10:30 pm and then I saw what at first seemed to be a passenger airplane at low altitude and low speed traveling west. It passed over head and then it began changing shape at about a mile away. It had red lights that didn't blink in the middle of it and other lights where wings would be but in triangular distances from each other. As it changed shape, the red lights didn't move but the other light moved from their position from the sides to the direct top and bottom! Then it was very strange to look at for a number of seconds because it looked like an airplane flying on it's side at low speed and low altitude. Then, the lights began to turn off. I lost track of it as it passed away from me beyond the tree line. I traveled straight to the only airport in the area just in case it was a plane trying to make a hard turn back to the airport, but then there was no airbourne vehicle to be found heading to the airport or in the area for that matter. My cellphone began turning off by itself about a half an hour before until an hour  after I saw this UFO. It was at half battery life and not low at all. I have never had this problem with my cellphone before this sighting or even since then. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
