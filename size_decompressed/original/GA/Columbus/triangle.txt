He called me outside the building and stated there was a low flying aircraft headed from the north towards our building.  Several workers stepped outside and after a few minutes, realized it was a low flying black triangular shaped craft passing overhead.  The aircraft was approximately 200 yards from rear corner to rear corner.  There were white lights on each corner, a total of three lights.  There were no other lights visible.   The aircraft was so large and so low it felt like we could have thrown a rock and hit it.  There was absolutely no sound emitting from the craft.   It flew overhead very slowly and headed towards the main area of the Fort Benning military installation.  I should state that our location was almost adjacent to the military installation boundary and the craft was moving parallel to the boundary.  It continued moving in south trajectory, until it disappeared.   We all looked at each other and asked if anyone knew what we witnessed.  Everyone stated that they did not know what it was.  I was a UFO skeptic up to this point in time.  I do not make a judgement as to whether it was extra-terrestrial, or terrestrial, in nature.   I am reporting this because I want your organization to have the data in your files to accumulate your raw data and be able to compile it and have another data point to evaluate in comparison to other data.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
