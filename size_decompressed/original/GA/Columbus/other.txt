2 orange lights near runway seen by young but experienced observer;1970-02-20 19:30:00;1minute;2 orange lights near runway seen by young but experienced observer We moved to the residence at ((number deleted--XXXX)) Emily Drive in Columbus, GA in 1964. It is located near the local airport which services both airlines, general aviation and some military training flights so I was used to seeing aircraft of all types take off from many, many vantage points, including the front living room where I was this Saturday night (i know it was a Saturday becasue my parents and my dad's boss and his wife were playing pinochle in the kitchen as they did every Saturday night). We had a large picture window and as I watched out of it, I saw two orange (not red) lights leave from the vicinity of the runway and rise in a very shallow takeoff. Halfway up, they made a sharp lateral 45 degree jag (not the usual banked turn but a true 45 degree right hand veer in their horizontal course) and immediately made a return to their original horizantal position (that is made a similar but counter 45 degree jag to the left). They then promptly changed attitudes so that their climb was about 60-70 degrees and left the area. There is a road 1 house down from ours that could have casued car tailights to reflect on the glass with a gust of wind making it appear as if they deveated from their path. However, again, the lights were orange, not red as expected on tailights or position lights of aircraft. Additionally, I did not see any vehicles on the second road before or after I saw these lights. I was watching out the window as I listened to albums so was not distracted.

The military transported an acorn shaped object the size of an old Volkswagen  Beetle to the Columbus Metropolitan Airport.;2006-11-29 16:30:00;1 minute;The military transported an acorn shaped object the size of an old Volkswagen  Beetle to the Columbus Metropolitan Airport. While driving down the road next to the Columbus Metropolitan Airport, I saw a military flatbed type of vehicle drive fast down the road to the airport entrance while I drove the opposite direction.  As we crossed paths, I saw that they were transporting only one thing.  It was acorn shaped with only a tarp and straps to hold it in place.   I believe that my sighting is related with this UFO crash in Columbus, GA.  The night before, I heard on the radio from a CNN news update that a plane crashed near Macon Rd. earlier that day.  At the time, I did not link the two because they had reported it as a plane.  I did some private investigating into this UFO crash after finding out that it wasn't a plane about 6 months after it happened.   I'm really sorry to the readers that I didn't submit my report sooner and didn't get any pictures of the acorn shaped object, but I've met up with a key witness and I do believe I've located the crash site. The key witness saw the metallic object in the air and then saw it crash.  He thought it was a plane crashing even though he didn't see any wings.  There is a crater about 40 feet wide there at the crash site.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
I have pics!;2016-03-30 21:00:00;3 minutes;I have pics! Object descended was red ball slight tail.  Moved erratically but not too fast. Changed color, direction and speed.  The KEY element here is I have five photos taken from cell phone that are pretty definitive.  The last of the five shows round object with crescent lighting.  You can see distinctive round or disk shape.  The initial color was red then multi-colored, then white and final color was green (the crescent lighting) before it slowly eased out of view behind roof of hotel I was staying at.  Pics show hotel in foreground to give a point of reference, size wise.  Lasted about 3 min. went around hotel to see more however it was gone.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
