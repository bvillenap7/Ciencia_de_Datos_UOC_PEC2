2 red lights in formation with 2 other red lights traveling very slow at low altitude. 15 minutes later a light pulsating like crazy.;2009-03-03 20:30:00;2 minutes;2 red lights in formation with 2 other red lights traveling very slow at low altitude. 15 minutes later a light pulsating like crazy. I was driving west in the middle of Columbus, GA. I saw a helicopter with the usual bright white light and a couple of other lights with one blinking. To me, no big deal. 6 minutes later as I headed north, I saw 2 red lights not far away from 2 other red lights. There were no other lghts on these UFOs. I tried to get closer, but as I got closer they started to fly further and further away. I had my video camera with me and I tried my hardest to at least get some video, but I could not. I drove after them but I lost them. About 15 minutes, I saw a single light pulsating like crazy. I pulled out my camcorder that was turned on, but it some how turned off by itself so I had to turn it back on. As I drove toward that UFO, it flew away as well.

UFO seen not moving in the air for at least a minute then I got closer to it but it flew away from me.;2009-03-21 02:30:00;6 minutes;UFO seen not moving in the air for at least a minute then I got closer to it but it flew away from me. I saw something in the sky at low altitude that wasn't moving at all. It had a bright red light and a couple other white lights but none were blinking. I parked my car after seeing it and waited for a minute to see it move, but it didn't. I noticed that 2 police officers were outside looking at it. There were many more people around but they did not notice it. It seems that most people don't see UFOs when they do show up. I started to get closer to it but then it started to move in the opposite direction. I chased it down the highway going 60 miles per hour, but I still couldn't catch it. After a mile down the road, it turned of all white lights and it only had its red light on. Again, no lights ever blinked. I was the person who reported the last 2 sightings in Columbus, GA. It's a shame that I've been the only person reporting for the whole entire city. I'm a very honest person and take these events very seriously. I videotape every sighting that I can, but unfortunately only have caught 1 UFO on film.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
Bright amber lights travelling toward airport and army base;2013-05-23 23:00:00;60 seconds;Bright amber lights travelling toward airport and army base I was in the process of getting a few items out of my car before going into the back yard and sit by the pool, admire the full moon, and make a phone call.  I don't recall why I looked up into the sky but I looked up and there were two amber colored lights floating across the sky.   A small airport is 2-3 miles away so I am accustomed to seeing objects in the sky but nothing like this. I have been an airplane buff since I was a kid and, even as an adult, I still look up to the sky when aircraft pass over.  I know that airplanes have red and green blinking lights and that's what caught my attention, the fact that they were steady lights and amber-colored.  They looked to be fairly low-flying, perhaps no more than 500 ft above me and flying over the spot 200 yards away from where I was standing. As I saw these two lights coming in my direction, at first I thought, That is something big, because I was thinking it was the lights on the front of a plane's landing gear.   But then I could determine space between the two lights, with sky in the background, and I realized it was two separate entities. I listened for sound but heard absolutely nothing.  No propeller, no jet engine, zero sound.  Even with the light of a full moon, I could not determine the shape of any sort of craft.  They just looked like two bright lights floating across the sky. The lights were traveling at a steady velocity and did not deviate from each other. They were traveling towards the southwest, directly at the airport.  Also in the southwest direction, a few miles beyond the airport, is a large U.S. Army base.  Thus, at the time, I thought I was seeing some sort of experimental military aircraft. I watched the lights for as long as I could see them. They seemed to slow down as they approached the approximate vicinity of the airport but that may have simply been an illusion as they got farther away from me. Eventually, they were hidden by the trees and I could no longer see them so I don't know what direction/action they took once they reached the airport.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
