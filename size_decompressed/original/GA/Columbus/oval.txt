Two lightish green/blue oval shaped objects traveling in a north to south direction, covered my visible portion of the sky extremely rapidly, flying in formation, no sound came from the objects, they seemed to be at about 3000-5000 ft altitude, moving constantly in a straight line, they seemed to be almost transparent except for the brighter color in the middle of each object, I moved quickly from my chair, to follow their path and watch them disappear over my horizon (neighbors trees and house).;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
