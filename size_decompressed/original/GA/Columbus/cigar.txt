8 Objects in the sky over Columbus, Georgia.;2007-12-07 17:45:00;2-3 minutes;8 Objects in the sky over Columbus, Georgia. Outside of the Hamilton Road area, a friend and I glanced up at the sky to notice 8 objects...or what we thought was originally 7. We watched for a minute and saw the object on the right was actually two as if it seperated to make a total of 8 objects. After it separated it elevated without changing direction. After a couple of minutes they faded away. It was nearing sundown. While they were in the sky most of them stayed idle in the sky or moved slightly except for the one on the right that moved up quite a bit. There was no bright colors or anything coming from them. No explanation.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
