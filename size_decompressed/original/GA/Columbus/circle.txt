Moving white star light with flash in Georgia sky.;2016-06-26 23:18:00;2 minutes;Moving white &quotstar light&quot with flash in Georgia sky. At approximately 11:18 on June 26, 2016, I looked out the bedroom window, as I often do. It faces east.  There were stars, as usual.  I noticed a pair of stars.  They were shining and then one just “went out”.  I thought maybe a passing cloud blocked it, etc..  But the sky was clear.  About 25 seconds later the “light” switched on again, a little farther south.  Then it went off again. twenty seconds later, it appeared a third time a little farther south, then off again.  Finally a flash, much larger than the tiny, “star light”.  It was lower on the horizon.  It was almost like a small explosion of white light or a camera flash, very bright, brief and then it disappeared.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
Round, shiny objects flying in formation moved in ways not consistent with aircraft, balloons or anything else.;2016-10-06 14:30:00;4-5 minutes;Round, shiny objects flying in formation moved in ways not consistent with aircraft, balloons or anything else I was in an industrial area of a large Southern city that boarders a very large military base.   Around 14:30 I was standing in a large lot looking up at the completely clear sky.  Almost immediately I saw two groups of 4 each objects approximately 500-700 feet in the sky moving in two formations of 4 each on Y shadows with the bottom of the Y being the lead in each group.  The objects were very shiny and each had a prominent white, thick, round, white circle within each object.  Both groups were moving East to West.  At first, I thought they might be balloons, mini-helicopters or drones.  But each group would move in formation and then suddenly completely stop, then shoot up, down, backwards and then race forward at amazingly speed.  Then at one point, both groups shot up until they could no longer be seen.  During these maneuvers  several times one object in each formation would break away;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512

Milgen Road is the location where the object was sited by four witnesses.  This certainly doesn't look like a star.  Could be a planet, very, very unsure.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
