as close as a telephone pole;1974-06-30 00:00:00;3 minutes;as close as a telephone pole My friend and I were laying out looking at the stars. The radio was on and there had been several calls reporting ufo sightings to the radio, in the distance approximantly 5 miles away you could see an object with lights going around the edge, I watched it and as it was traveling across and not directly toward us I ran down the street to intercept it as I got to the corner it was directly above me, hovered,  I was the distance of a telephone pole above my head, it made no noise, lights of all different colors flashed around it, then I blinked and it was like a mile away, still no sound.   This was a long time ago, and this is the best I can remember, I never forgot it, I was right under the thing.  It was about cars with across, saucer shaped , and beautiful colored lights.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
Army soldiers see object over Fort Benning, Georgia;1983-08-15 23:30:00;15 Minutes;Army soldiers see object over Fort Benning, Georgia Our Basic training company at Fort Benning, Georgia was doing night training on firing the 81mm mortar. We all looked up when this huge saucer shaped object floated from the south west to the north east It made no noise and had several irregular lights in what appeared to be port holes. The object was spinning in a clock wise rotation about one full turn every two minutes, Its speed seemed to be 10 mph and it appeared to be about a quarter mile in diameter and was about 500 ft above the ground. The object appeared to resemble a space station similar to to the one I saw in the movie Close encounters of the third kind If you remember the scene where Richard Dreyfuss was at the RR tracks and he looked up and saw this spinning space station type object. A master sergeant was mad at us for looking up. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
UFO outside window, waits in backyard;1992-08-18 02:00:00;1 minute;UFO outside window, waits in backyard My cousin was staying with us for the Summer.  We were about 13 and 14, then.  She was sleeping next to one of the windows in my bedroom.  I was on the other side of the room, facing away from the window.  We had just turned the light off.  She said there was a UFO outside the window.  I had seen UFO's before.  I thought she was just trying to annoy me.  She said it again, and I got up and went to the window.  There was a UFO.  I told her to get up and run...outside.  We ran out of my room, through the house, and outside into the backyard.  It was still there.  Did it wait for us?  I was disk-shaped with whitish-colered lights and/or glow.  It hovered above us for a few seconds, then took off.  What is so strange, is that we were in a neighborhood where the neighbor's house was only about 15 feet from the window.  The UFO appeared larger than that.  Maybe they can change sizes?
