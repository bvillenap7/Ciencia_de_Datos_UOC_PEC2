Light grows and shrinks in size, brightens and dims, then disappears.;2000-07-04 03:00:00;10 seconds;Light grows and shrinks in size, brightens and dims, then disappears. I work 3rd shift security at a shopping plaza, outdoors, and watch the sky every night.  On the above date and time, I saw a light that at first I thought was a star. It was about the same height as other stars, and about the same size. Then I saw this light start to move slowly across the sky, and as it did, it started to get brighter and grew to about 5 times its original size. Then it started to dim and shrink until it just disappeared.  This was a single steady white light, not blinking.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
Four individual lights moving rapidly across the night sky,  at common interval, all in same direction;2005-01-01 21:00:00;5 minutes;Four individual lights moving rapidly across the night sky,  at common interval, all in same direction I was walking our dog around the neighborhood, like I do every evening.  It was New Years day and I had heard a few fireworks earlier that evening, but considering the date everything was quiet.  The sky was mostly cloudy, but with areas where stars could be seen clearly.  I was walking down the street in an Easterly direction looking up at the stars when I saw a white light traverse the sky, approximately  from south to north.  There was no object visible just light, illuminating the cloud cover from behind.  The light moved very fast, in a straight line across the sky in about one second.  If I had not been looking up I would never have seen it.  At first I thought it might have been from a search-light, like auto dealers sometimes use, but the movement was too fast crossing, the sky in one direction only and with no visible beam projected from the ground.  I continued watching the area, and within less than a minute the light appeared again, from the same approximate point in the South following a streight course to the North.  Again I continued to watch, ane within less than a minute I saw the light again a third time, on the same course and speed.  I watched a little longer, but didn't see anything more so I continued my dog walking.  As I apprached the end of the street, at a slightly different heading, I looked back again at the sky and saw a forth light, traveling the same path as the other three. I then returned home.  As I stated, there was no visible object with any of these four light sources.  Rather the light appeared to be projected from behind the clouds onto the surface.  The lights appeared rectangular, with rounded corners, dimensionally the length appeared to be about three times the width, although this could have been an illusion caused by the speed the lights moved.  Ther was no sound associated with this incident what so ever.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
Light in the east burning very bright. it was flashing red, blue, white, and orange.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star.  PD));2007-09-30 01:00:00;15min;i was on my poch  trying to get tired when i noticed a light in the east burning very bright. it was flashing red, blue, white, and an orange-yellow. although there was no distinguishable pattewrn to the lights, they were not random. blue always led the series. it pulsated for a few minutes and the went igher in the sky. there it zigzagged in place and proceeded to rise and fall very quickly. at one point i could make out several smaller lights come close to the object and fly off again. at one time it looked like the light was getting dimmer but all of a sudden it burned very white, faded to blue, then disappeared from sight.

Erratic moveing white light in Southeastern US;2008-08-20 23:50:00;25 minutes;Erratic moveing white light in Southeastern US I went outside and sat down on porch steps. I live in a rural area and on this night the sky was very clear. I noticed a white light in the sky that I assumed was a plane. When first noticed it was moving in a straight line but upon focusing on the light I noticed it was moving in an erratic pattern. After watching the light dance around in the sky for about 5 minutes I called my brother outside to watch it with me. The light stayed within my sight for at least 25 minutes and it was at about the same altitude as a plane but did not have the colored signaling lights as planes do. The light would hover in one spot for a while then it would shoot forward very fast. It would also go from right to left and in circles not moving much from its original position.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512

Orange lights each in different brightness in a formation that resembled an inverted little dipper in the dark night sky;2010-10-09 20:15:00;3-5 minutes;Orange lights each in different brightness in a formation that resembled an inverted little dipper in the dark night sky UFO Sighting over Columbus, Georgia. Date: 09OCT2010 Time: 20:15 EDT Location: Columbus, Georgia. 31909 Account as it happened. While driving South on I185 at the exit on Georgia Hwy 80W to Phenix City, Alabama my wife and I had noticed several orange lights in the sky that sort of resembled the little dipper in an inverted position at about a 10:00 position in the night sky. As we exited the Interstate and on to Ga. Hwy 80W we watched the lights stay in the same position or a holding pattern and the lights which numbered at least 12 or more slowly go out one by one in no special order. We were slowed down on the divided highway because of other vehicles on the roadway that were also observing this unexplained sighting. Vehicles were on the shoulder on the West bound side and a car in the median and exit ramp on the East bound side at Bradley Park East exit. Ft Benning, Georgia is South of Columbus, Georgia. I served 10 years in the military and in combat and can say that this was not helicopters, aircraft, night fire training flares or fireworks. The objects in the numbers we saw would no way be any type of aircraft that could hold that position or that close of a pattern and then slowly go out. The only time I saw any aircraft not using marker lights was in a combat theater and there is not any combat operations happening in Columbus, Georgia that would result in aircraft having marker lights on and then turned off slowly. This ordeal lasted roughly 5-6 minutes from our account. We have never encountered anything like this ever in our lives or seen anything quite like it.

Dozens of flickering fast moving lights.;2014-04-25 22:15:00;2 minutes;dozens of flickering fast moving lights Swiftly moving flickering lights in clusters and several formations, several two-by-two.  Headed from the north toward the south.  Mostly bright white, but some flickered red and yellow and white.  No discernible noise.   All lights were moving in relative unison at the same speed.  Looked almost like they were moving down-river as if on a current.  There seemed to be several dozen lights flying not too high above the tree tops.;32.4818159303883;-84.9644448460512
Very bright and flashing light right near the airport 3 times now.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Mars?  PD));2018-07-05 03:00:00;~1 hour;Very bright and flashing light right near the airport 3 times now I witnessed a light on Saturday night near the Columbus airport in a neighborhood close by. I watched it for at least 2 hours and it seemed to move occasionally.  It was much bigger than a star and would pulsate and flash or blink.  Sometimes it would go much dimmer.i took many videos and zoomed way in with a camera app on my phone to took several photoa.  They are not the best quality but the object seems to have a circle in the middle of an x in the visible ones.  My phone kept shutting off as if I had no battery even though it was well charged.   Eventually I left and was wondering what it could have been.  My friend whos house it was didn't think it was a ufo of any kind and blew the idea off.   July 3rd late at night we saw the same light in the same exact spot and I felt embarrassed thinking I must have been wrong about the ufo idea.  It must be a satellite or something else.  I'm not sure but two times in the same spot made me doubt myself.  Then there was last ni! ght July the 4th. I saw the same light again.  It seemed brighter and this time there was also a 2nd one a ways across the sky.   I was no certain something is going on and when I went inside to get my phone to take a picture I came back out and it was completely gone.  The first light remained there and didn't seem to do anything strange.  Aside from the occasional flashes and blinks it never flew or moved.  It seemed to just stay in the same place.
