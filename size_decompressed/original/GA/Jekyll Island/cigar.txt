Two black/dark colored cigar shaped craft.;2019-11-18 15:00:00;1 minute;Two black/dark colored cigar shaped craft. At around 3 p.m. on November 18, 2019. I was at the Southern end of the taxi-way near runway 36 at 09J.  I witnessed two black or dark colored cigar shaped craft with an estimated length of 50' to 60' with an estimated diameter of 12'-15'.                                                                               The objects were travelling from East to West. Approximately 1/2  mile  South of the Jekyll Island Bridge and causeway.                                                                                                                                 The initial witnessed altitude was around 2000'.   Moving at a speed of 250 to 300 knots. The objects appeared to be directly behind each other at a distance of 200'. Suddenly. The object's altitude dropped to around 500' in about 4 seconds. No nose downward tilt. Perfectly level these two objects descended. They continued on the East/West path maintaining speed. The leading craft disappeared/vanished while well in my sight. The trailing craft continued on the East/West trajectory until it was out of visual range. 10-15 minutes later. I noticed what looked like a military helicopter circling around the area near where the leading object disappeared. The NAVY practices helicopter training maneuver's using Sea Hawk's  at O9J regularly. I am well versed in their flight patterns. This appeared to be a Sea Hawk circling over the marsh area in search of something.;31.0763;-81.4111
