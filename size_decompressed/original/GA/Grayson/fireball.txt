4 white/orange orbs seen over Grayson/Lawrenceville GA neighborhoods 11/05/2013.;2013-11-05 18:30:00;5-10 minutes;4 white/orange orbs seen over Grayson/Lawrenceville GA neighborhoods 11/05/2013 I was in a parking lot and looked up toward the north sky.  I saw 4 objects that were stationary and appeared to be a bright white to orange in color.   They were at uneven levels from each other.  Two were close together and parallel to the horizon, one was feet above the other two, and the fourth one was about 200ft from the others.   They were motionless and made no sounds.  They appeared to sparkle or pulse in lights but never went out.   I made a few pictures from my phone but they don't appear as colorful or large as they were to me.   The sky was dark, the air was around 54 degrees.   I looked around to see if anyone else was in the parking lot looking at them but didn't see anyone.   I called home to speak to my mother as I was looking at them because my family and some friends have been seeing a lot of unexplained crafts (UFOs)in our skies over the last 8 years. After I watched them for a few minutes they just disappeared.;33.893;-83.9649
