We lived across from the Milledgeville Country Club in Milledgeville, GA.  I was around 8 yrs. of age and I shared a room with my older sister who was 15.   We were in our separate beds about to go to sleep when my sister said, “Oh my God!  What is that?”  She got out of her bed and ran to our window.  I was afraid to get out of bed, but my sister made me.  What we saw still gives me chill bumps when I think about it.  It was a UFO!  It looked like the cheesy UFOs that you see in those old science fiction movies.  It was disk shaped with many lights of different colors (yellow, orange, red)all around it.  It was hovering back and forth over the golf course, which our window faced.  My sister and I were frozen in fear.  It hovered for over a minute and then disappeared over the golf course.  We ran to our parents, who were still awake watching TV, and told them what we saw.  They were, of course, quite skeptical of their young daughters who came running to the! m raving about a UFO over the golf course.  Our dad went and checked outside and saw nothing.  Twenty years later and my sister and I still talk about it whenever we get together. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));33.0787148148144;-83.2376027777781
