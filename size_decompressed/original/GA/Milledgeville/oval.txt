I was nine years old when it happened, and even to this day I can't understand why the distant memory sticks with me. I remember playing alongside my grandmother's house on a summer day, while enjoying the company of three close cousins.  We had ran around chasing one another until our feet tired, only to seek for shade subsequently after.  I remembered talking a little after that when, after standing up from where I was sitting, saw what looked like a big flock of birds above.  It looked as though they were shaped, or in a oval form like a bigger bird, but they didn't flap instead glided and were very quiet.  I was instantly aware that this wasn't normal bird activity causing me to go into sheer panic.  I ran for my life.  The others, who were left behind, kept starred at it.  Whatever it was I remember it headed east.  It was the strangest thing.  I still wonder what it was exactly.;33.0787148148144;-83.2376027777781

Also would get close at times I was looking out our huge bedroom window and admiring the stars.  I saw 2 very bright lights n 2 different locations.  They were noticable because they where changing colors form red to white to blue.  They also would at times move side to side and up and down.  They also would seem to get closer at times.  At times they almost faded away.  I watched them for about an hour and was mesmerized. My husband has seen them before as well.;33.0787148148144;-83.2376027777781
