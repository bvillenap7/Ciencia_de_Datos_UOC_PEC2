Dark object over old Central State Hospital.;2019-05-12 00:30:00;1 hour;Dark object over old Central State Hospital. Nights of May 9th and May 12th.  May 9th around 12:30am dark figure shape in sky with buzzards moving back and forth fast much larger than the buzzards around it over Central State Hospital.  40 minutes observed this night.  May 12th 10pm second sighting.  Object drops down breaking tree branches.  We went to observe when we seen something in all black around 7 foot in height we assume to be female dart into one of the Central State Hospital buildings.  We followed said object as it entered some type of large concrete and metal pipe tunnel system (old hospital water system tunnel maybe).  We was unable to follow further due to darkness however we heard it continue to travel down tunnels followed by the echo of a metal gate slamming, observed this night 20 minutes.  Phone received power surge damage during May 12th encounter.  Nothing else to report and sky was too dark to make better observation.;33.0787148148144;-83.2376027777781
