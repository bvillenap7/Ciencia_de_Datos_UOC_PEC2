Dim light in the sky like a faint star;2000-09-19 21:05:00;4 seconds;Dim light in the sky like a faint star I was watering plants on my front porch when i looked up in the sky to the southwest. I was looking at the Little Dipper when a light as faint as one of the stars moved from north to south. The light then faded out in the distant light haze. It was probably a satellite or maybe the space shuttle.It was too slow to be a meteor and was not bright at all. The duration of the entire event was 4 seconds.;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
2 different moving lights over Duluth.;2005-09-19 21:30:00;3 minutes;2 different moving lights over Duluth. I was outside playing pool with my sister in-law about 9:30 tonight.  I wasn't playing well, and looked up and asked for help from the heavens, and noticed a star that was moving.  It looked like a regular star and it was directly above us.  We ar right under the flight path for Hartsfield-Jackson airport, so I KNOW it was not a plane, it wasn't even taking the flight path.  It moved east, made a slow turn to the north, back to the east, blinked three times, shot a little red light to it's right side, and blinked off.  In this time, we ran from the back yard, to the front yard, because of trees blocking the line of sight.   As we were returning to our game, I saw a bright light in the sky through the trees to the west, we saw a large orange/red light.  That changed from orange to red to orange.  it was moving slowly to the west, and at first, it was really bright, and then it blinked off and on, but when it turned on again, it was dimmer than when it had started, it kept getting dimmer and dimmer, and before we lost sight of it, it turned red.  it was too bug to be a star or plane, in fact, we saw several planes pass in front of it which were higher than it seemed to be, but looked much smaller than the light.  I'm 2 years new to the area, so I wonder if anyone else saw this, and wonder how often this occurs in such a high air-traffic area.

UFO with 2 White Lights.;2014-04-08 22:28:00;30 seconds;UFO with 2 White Lights. I was driving and stopped at a stop light & saw a moving craft hovering under the clouds. The craft was 2 bright white lights & it moved from right to left slowly.  The left to right movements were dramatic & thats what caught my attention.  It was in the visual range of less then a mile away from where I was located. It was a cloud covered night & you could not see the sky/stars.  It was also a night of high winds, so I dont think any small aircraft or helo's would be flying on a night like this.  The craft was mostly stationary other then the left to right movements. I would like to add I am a navy veteran & worked directly with aircraft & know what an aircraft looks like & how they move through the sky.  This sighting out of the ordinary.;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
Red plane looking light that flashes blue and white, moved horizontally and suddenly flew down;2016-06-21 22:41:00;1 minute;Red plane looking light that flashes blue and white, moved horizontally and suddenly flew down It all started with a walk to the convenient store around 10:10 p.m. I usually observe the sky as I’m walking anywhere.  It was cloudy and I couldn’t spot the moon, but the moon was out because it is on full moon phase.  Odd enough I didn’t worry too much.  About ½ a mile, I reach the shop, buy a cigar, and I leave.   The first thing I see in the sky is Spica, the brightest star in the constellations. Nothing new. I then look to the right and I see the orange moon, looking as if it were an eye that were half closed.  I begin to ramble with myself about the moon, I thought, “It decides to show itself, when it wants to.”   As I continue to walk home the moon unveils itself more.  It just captures my attention!  Closer to home the moon is out of view, but I’m still keeping my eye out for it.   I get into the complex, I see the moon, it’s beginning to look like somebody is wiping their forehead.  I say to myself, “Show me something tonight.”  The moon now looks like a raccoon face or a ninja turtle, a mask over the eyes.  I am reaching home stretch, I then look up and see a red light in the sky, it flashes blue and white.  I think it’s a plane, then I quickly change my mind and noticed it wasn’t moving.  At this moment trees are blocking my view.  I walked passed the white big rig truck and I continue to look at it, it hasn’t moved, suddenly, it dashes to its right, my left, then to the left, (at this time I’m completely shocked), then it literally flies downward out of view.  The moon is no longer in sight.;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
I seen 3 circular lights,one was luminous bright white, the other  ((anonymous report));2018-08-04 23:00:00;1 hour;I was on my back porch, behind my backyard are wetlands (very dense).  I seen 3 circular lights, one was luminous bright white, the other two are luminous amber.  They are at least 30ft high and are in different areas (not together).  They slide from right to left at times and up & down, but very slight, almost as if it's searching or scoping the area.  Definitely not drones.  They have been here off & on for several weeks.  I do have pictures & video for confirmation.;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
