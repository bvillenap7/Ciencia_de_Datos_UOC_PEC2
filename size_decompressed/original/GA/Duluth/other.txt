As ;1998-10-17 19:00:00;30 minutes;I was driving home on the interstate.  I saw a very large bright light in the sky.  I thought it might have been Venus or a plane.  As I got closer I realised it wasn't. Because I was catching up with it and it never moved!  When I was able to see it more closely  its shape reminded me of the bottom half of the space shuttle very similar to a Manta Ray shape .  It had a matte charcoal surface  And their were rows of circular lights on the bottom. I could see a radio tower and it was over and higher than the tower.  I could see the tower and the red lights but there was nothing but air below the object in the sky.  And as for it being Venus, planets are not that large;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
Enormous SR71-like UFO sighting, silhouette in front of full moon.;2000-02-06 23:00:00;2 seconds;Enormous SR71-like UFO sighting, silhouette in front of full moon My father and I were fishing on Cardinal Lake late one evening, trolling around the perimeter of the lake on a paddle boat.  We happened to look to the sky at the same moment, and in front of the moon passed an object.  We both saw it, yet, we did not speak of it for several minutes.  We were both processing what we had just observed.  My father, with hesitation, asked, Did you just see that? ... I confirmed by suggesting it looked like the SR71. Though there were some clouds in the sky, we had a direct line of sight to the full moon.  The UFO passed swiftly, though, the pace was slow enough for a positive visual.  The UFO must have been enormous, as the object was larger than the moon from our position.  To put this in context, if a person were looking at the moon and used their hand to simulate moving an object past, an almond may relatively portray the size of the SR71/UFO - which, of course, was in space.   It was black, sharp and distinct, and a total brute traveling smoothly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
Bright yellow lights moved up and down in a zig-zag spiraling motion then disappeared.;2012-09-05 21:00:00;8 minutes;Bright yellow lights moved up and down in a zig-zag spiraling motion then disappeared. On Sept 5, 2012 at approximately 9PM, I was out with the dogs on the sidewalk in front of our house.  I observed what appeared to be four-five lights in the SW sky.  The lights were a very bright yellow and appeared to have the shape of planes or were 'bird-like' in shape. The moved around in a zig zag and spiraling motion, up and down, and then disappeared.  As quickly as those lights disappeared, another three - four lights appeared, moving in the same zig-zag spiraling up and down motion, then disappearing. Suddenly, there were about three more lights, repeating the same motion and movement. The objects made no sound. I quickly attempted to get another family member outside, but could only locate one person.  The family member saw nothing, but while he was standing there, another light flashed across the sky, but was much further away.  Family member did not see the one light, nor any of the other lights. Family member suggested a meteor shower, but the objects were shaped like planes(or birds), were bright yellow, did not flashe across the sky, and they were all the same shape and size. (I do not believe in UFOs, and before now, would have never thought of reporting to a site like this one. I have seen meteor showers before, and have never witnessed anything like this.);34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
