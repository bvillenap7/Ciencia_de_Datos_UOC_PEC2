It stayed in the same spot,never moving. About ten minutes later I looked away for about 2 seconds...looked back up and I didnt see it.. I said ...i lost it....my friend said it was over here...i looked over and there it was....it went from me looking at it in the 12o'clock to the 10 0'clock pos..in a matter of seconds....for how high it was to move that fast was remarkable...then i looked away after about 5 mins...looked up....it was gone!I've seen the same thing about 12 yrs ago...;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
