Low to mid-pitched frequency sounds in middle of night from heavily clouded sky.;2013-03-06 01:00:00;20 minutes;Low to mid-pitched frequency sounds in middle of night from heavily clouded sky Three low to mid-pitched frequency sounds lasting 10-15 seconds followed by 15 sec quiet, then another round of three 10-15 second low to mid-pitched frequency sounded again, followed by another 15 second of quiet.  This sound & quiet pattern cycled for about 15 minutes.  The noises sounded like electronic frequency sounds.  My attempts to identify the location of the sound lead me outside.  The sound seemed to be coming from the heavily clouded sky.  This sound was eerie, almost like the frequency sound in the movie Close Encounters, yet not as loud.;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
I think this was for my eyes only!;2016-09-03 06:55:00;5 Seconds;I think this was for my eyes only! I had just woke out of my sleep. I peered out of the window to see if the sky had been foggy or not, and as I did, i saw these red and white lights, flying by my window, but they were fading  into transparency, as if they weren't meant to be seen. Picture an airplane, flying reallly low and visibly and it starts to blend in withh the color of the sky. That's all.;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
