Squiggley line of faint Lights.;2015-11-06 17:00:00;1 minute;Squiggley Line of Faint Lights I was on the phone with my wife, walking in my backyard at 6:55 pm (dusk).  The sky was not completely dark yet, and the sun had already set.  High white clouds were still visible in the sky.  I live near Peachtree Industrial Boulevard and Pleasant Hill Rd. I looked up and saw a squiggly line of faint white lights, maybe 20 or so, very close together, like they were on a rope strung together.   The formation was moving about the same speed as Canada geese, and was very high in the sky, too high for birds.   I watched it for a while, about a minute, as it went behind a small cloud, and came out the other side of the cloud, so it was very high.  Finally the faint lights faded from view in the distance.   It travelled from Northeast to Southwest.    I watched it long enough to comment several times to my wife that I was watching something strange and she suggested taking a picture, but my phone was too slow to use the camera.;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
