By the time I saw it (maybe 5 seconds later) it was at about 45 degrees in the sky in relation to my vantage point.  It appeared to be spherical (or at least circular) in shape and black.  I saw no detail at all.  It appeared to be one quarter of the sun's size.  It was moving at a steady pace WSW and appeared to be ever so slightly descending…hard to tell, though.  From the time I saw it until it disappeared behind a building on the horizon, about 10 seconds had passed.;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
very bright circular object, white light, moving to the east;2009-05-28 21:50:00;1.5 minutes;very bright circular object, white light, moving to the east at 9:50 PM traveling weat to east, at about a 95degree heading I saw a very bright light/object. It looked like a small moon but much brighter. I had my binoculars with me in the driveway (15x80) and when I looked at the object through those it was too bright.  More people had to have seen this. As it got further away it sped up and changed to an orange hue.  Not usre if the colr change was caused by a few whispy clouds or not. It was not a plane, Venus, a satellite (way too big and bright) or any meteor.;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675

And the sun was low in the western sky. I was driving South, on Pleasant Hill Road towards 85, when a round, orange glowing object, appeared low on the horizon. The object disappeared, and there was no aircraft, or such visible. I kept looking at the area in the sky, the orange glow appeared three more times, as it moved West. It looked like the reflection of the setting sun, but there was no visible aircraft. I am a 64!year old female, and I have never seen anything like this!;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
