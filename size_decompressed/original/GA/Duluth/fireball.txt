Odd red lights after storm in sky over Duluth, GA;2020-08-21 20:52:00;20 minutes;Odd red lights after storm in sky over Duluth, GA Good afternoon NUFORC,  This past Friday evening (08/21/2020)shorty after a pretty good thunderstorm in Duluth, GA--at 8:45PM, my girlfriend and myself were sitting on the front deck reviewing our week. The storm was past us heading NE (more Easterly),there was a rainbow about an hour prior to what we thought was an odd sighting.  As we looked from the SE to the NE we saw four red (round/cylindrical)close together--almost as if they were in a frame or structure.  But it was not moving, the 2 top red lights would disappear and then return.  Okay, someone as a drone or it's reflection off a cloud. We just had a thunderstorm and we could see the clouds moving pretty quick (20-25kn),then we started seeing commercial flying way below it.  The ATL airport is south of us--see planes a lot.  So we took pictures and video with two different phones (iPhone X & 11).  After 18-20 minutes it was gone. Regards,;34.0072348837207;-84.1477790697675
