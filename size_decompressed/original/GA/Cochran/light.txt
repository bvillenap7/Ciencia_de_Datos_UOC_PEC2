So I did not pay it much attention.  A few seconds later, I looked out again the light was still moving.  I noticed how quickly it was traveling.  I rolled down the window and watched it for a few minutes, nothing real extraordinary.  At this time I exited my car, and watched it fly for about 30 more seconds, when the object started flashing very quickly, exactly like a strobe light.  THE OBJECT UNMISTAKEBLY WAS FLASHING AT A FAST PACE AND HAD STOPPED MOVING ACCROSS THE SKY. After flashing for about 30 to 60 seconds the light disappeared.  Leaving me confused and exited.;32.4011;-83.3202000000001
