Did not move for 2 hrs. then in 10 minutes went behind tree line&gone A round very bright blinking light. Brighter than the northern star. With binoculors you could see it was flashing white,red,green lights. Appeared to be spinning in one spot for almost 2 hrs.in the western sky. Then within ten minutes it seemed to start moving and disapeared over the tree line. But never seemed to get smaller as it disapeared.Looked like the red and green lights were spinning very fast around the white light.
