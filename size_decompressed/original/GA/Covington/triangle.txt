bright spot light and a triangular object;2005-10-26 20:00:00;15 minutes;bright spot light and a triangular object I was driving home Wedsnday night on a back road with few trees and lots of cow pastures and seen this huge bright light in the sky, it looked like someone was pointing a bright spot light out of the sky and it was fairly close to the ground.  I turned around and parked in a side street close to where I had seen it and no longer seen the bright light.   I then seen a huge triangular looking shape (more like the shape of a pool ball rack) with oval shaped lights all around it. There looked to be nothing that the lights were attached to. The lights just sat there in the sky not moving,  I rolled down my window to see if I could hear something and it was dead quite.  After 5-10 minutes of watching these lights just sitting there in the sky I got freaked out and left.  Never have I believed in UFO's but now I believe that there is definatley something else out there.;33.5286505988023;-83.8579811377246
Black triangle with red blue and white lights. Did not move stayed over the trees then turned out its lights.;2011-09-06 21:02:00;15 sec;Black triangle with red blue and white lights.  Did not move stayed over the trees then turned out its lights  My mother and I were on our way home on hwy 212 and I just happened to look up because I saw some headlights. I only looked up because the headlights were really bright and I thought what plane would have bright lights like that.  So I told my mom to look and tell me what it was and when she looked she said she had no clue.  As we drove closer I saw that the thing did not come forward or move at all like a plane would and soon we passed it to our right. It was a triangle with a blue light on the left and a red light on the right with two bright white headlights on the front.  The back had white lights going across the whole back.  When we passed it I turned around in my seat and kept looking back while my mom was looking in the rear view mirror and it still did not move but it did turn its lights out and we could no longer see it.;33.5286505988023;-83.8579811377246
