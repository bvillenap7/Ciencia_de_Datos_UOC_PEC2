Bright light and flashing in covington ga;2007-12-06 00:00:00;20 minutes;Bright light and flashing in covington ga Me and my friend were coyote hunting and it was very windy out.  We were out there for about an hour when we first got out in the deer stand there was a orange light in the distance almost like some one was walking through the woods with a flash light.  Everything was still there was no wind and then out of no where a light lit up the deer stand we were in and we could see everything like some one was standing behind us with a giant spot light. Then after about 10 seconds of looking around it stared flashing like a strobe and we looked up and saw a blue figure in the sky it had no definite shape it was just there and then out of no where it was gone but it didn't leave a streak or anything behind it.It was just gone.It was the clearest light I have ever seen in my life it lit up the whole sky and it didn't hurt my eyes.  I was motionless and I couldn't look away I waited for him to say something and finally he did.I was nautious  but at ease all at the same time I was terrified but I couldn't move I couldn't look away and I couldn't move fast.  I was just there and it was there and my friend and it was like there was nothing else  around we were just singled out by everything.  I am not saying it was a ufo and I am not saying that it wasn't.  I am saying that is an experience that I will never forget and I question now if there is something out there that we don't know about something smarter than us and leaves me feeling very unsettled and I hope to never see anything like that the rest of my life!;33.5286505988023;-83.8579811377246
Bright White Light Flickering and Retracting long lines,  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a star??  PD));2009-03-08 19:00:00;45 minutes;Bright White Light Flickering and Retracting long lines March 8th 2009, here in Covington Ga , me my brother and his wife experienced a UFO siting. . On this date, around 7:00-7:30 pm , i got a call from my brother very excited/worried , telling me to hurry and come over. After I arrived, he didn't put any label on what it was, he just simply asked me what is that up there. . at first glance, I replied looks like a bright white light. . . after this being said, he replied, yeah, but there's no stars out right now . .(it hadn't gotten dark yet) While still observing the bright white light, something happened to convince me that it wasn't just a lone star. I began to see white lines projected in different angles. . and then pulled back in. . (i then closed my eyes and rubbed them with my knuckle to make sure that it wasn't possibly a glare from the light being so bright). . it was no glare. . the projecting lines, or what we called them at the time wings came out and were pulled back in for around 15-20 minutes, sometimes projecting out longer in length than others. . it was aparent that we were seeing the same thing and it was no glare, because when they were at a longer length, we both reacted at the same time explaining exactly what we were seeing. . . After watching this for around 30 mintues or so, we then saw another light going in the direction of the object we had been observing. this I easily identified as an airplane, (due to the flashing red lights) however, when the plane got somewhat close in the direction of the object, we then saw the object take off at a REDICULOUS speed and a weird angle almost arching upward towards the sky. .we watched as the object got smaller and smaller until we could no longer see it. After the plane passes , we're still looking at the same point in the sky that the object was . . and out of nowhere, we saw the object fly back, at the EXACT SAME POSITION and point in the sky as it was previous. . this was amazing. . After calming down, from what we saw, we continued to observe the object as it continued to project the wings, then pull them back in. afterwatching for another 15 minutes or so, we grew tired, and went in the house. Later,a bit after 9:00 pm the object was nowhere to be seen. . My brother is a very straight laced, mature adult (39 years old) and a police officer. . . for me to witness this with someone that i look up to, someone that i believe (if i had mentioned or told him a story like this,that he hadn't witnessed with HIS own eyes, he would NEVER believe me)  I've always been a believer of extraterrestrial , UFO findings etc. . but always had that bit of doubt in the back of my mind. . after seeing this with my own eyes. . AND with my brother being there seeing the same thing, backing me up. . . THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT ALIENS,UFO's,and LIFE on other planets DO EXIST. . . I have 5 , 30 second video clips, plus a picture taken with his Nextel i880 video phone as proof. . not the best quailty, but i'm glad we had SOMETHING to capture some type of evidence that we saw something out of the ordinary. . . I will be recording a video explaining exactly what i saw, this week, followed by all 5 video clips and picture summing up what we saw March 8th  2009, any information of groups or organizations in the Metro Atlanta Georgia area that shed light, investigates, or just has other witnesses of UFO's and extraterrestrial life would be appreciated. Upon request, i have 5 video clips as well as a photo of the occurance  ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a star??  PD));33.5286505988023;-83.8579811377246
Saw a bunch of low-altitude lights drifting overhead.;2013-10-11 20:45:00;5 minutes;Saw a bunch of low-altitude lights drifting overhead. I was driving home and noticed several lights hovering around the altitude you would normally see professional fireworks.  There were somewhere between 6 to 10 reddish orange lights.  I was unable to stop to snap a picture or listen for sounds.  They seemed to be drifting, and after I passed underneath them I was unable to get another look.

Multiple (14) object spotted flying equidistant and vanishing in the sky.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-31 21:35:00;~15 minutes;Multiple (14) object spotted flying equidistant and vanishing in the sky. My wife and I were taking our dogs outside from 2130-2145 on 3/31/2020. I looked up and saw an extremely high altitude object flying a linear flight path from ~240 degrees southwest to 60 degrees NE.  I took note of a commercial aircraft flying substantially lower than the first object I saw, so I know what we saw we not a conventional aircraft.  I pointed out the first object to my wife, who at first though it was an object in orbit.. as we have watched the ISS fly over before.  The object was bright enough to be seen by the naked eye. We were watching it, and it blinked a few times, dimmed, and vanished. There was no cloud coverage at the time, it simply vanished.  One object would not have been that big of a deal.. however, what happened next was certainly a big deal.  My wife and I stood outside and watched 13 more object flying in linear flight paths, from three different origins and end points. I verified the flight paths using a compass on my phone.  The o! bjects were flying equidistant, extremely high, just appeared as orbs of light.  They all flickered, dimmed, and vanished at the same spots in the sky. There may have been more objects, but cloud coverage moved in and blocked our view of the sky. It was astonishing! I hope others saw them too.;33.5286505988023;-83.8579811377246
