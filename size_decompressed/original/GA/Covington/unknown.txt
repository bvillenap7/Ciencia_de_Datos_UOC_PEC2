Unidentifiable flying objects hovering than moving in one direction, either saucer, triangle, or diamond shaped.;2020-11-25 17:30:00;20 minutes;Unidentifiable flying objects hovering than moving in one direction, either saucer, triangle, or diamond shaped. As I was driving, me and my significant other spotted in the sky what looked like multiple unknown flying objects. I did not really count because I was focusing on driving,  but I want to say there was at least about 6 or 8 of them flying towards the opposite direction where I was going. I was driving on SR-212 going towards Covington, GA near Newton County from Atlanta.They either looked like a saucer, triangle or diamond shaped. There was multiples of them. They would hover over sort of low for a couple of minutes and then move in one direction together. They did have lights, red, green, and white. Some of the lights would blink, and some would not, it was just lit up the whole time. The time was around 7:30PM and the date was 11/25/2020. The weather was cloudy and sprinkling rain but the unknown flying objects were still visible to see even in that type of weather. This was my first time ever seeing anything like this. I have multiple videos and I was abl! e to stop for a little bit and capture 3 of them flying next to each other, but I don’t know if the videos will do it justice because Iphone cameras suck and I don’t think my significant other did a great job at recording them. I also want to mention that my significant other claimed that he saw something similar to what we saw on 11/25/2020 last week in Atlanta. Whatever these are, they would just hover for a little bit, and then slowly move together in one direction.;33.5286505988023;-83.8579811377246
