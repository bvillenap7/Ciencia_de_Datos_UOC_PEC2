Dancing light in the Georgia sky;2003-08-22 01:00:00;1 hour;Dancing light in the Georgia sky I noticed a light in the sky south of Mars (which is highly cisable these days). I noticed this bright light that at first appeared to be a star, but it began to move. It wasn't like a plane in the sky, it moved left and rright and up and down. It changed direction very quickly. I made my wife and fathe in law get out of the bed to see it and they confirmed that they were seeing the same thing I was. This lasted for about an hour or so, until I lost visual contact due to cloud cover. I did notice that there seemed to be a change of red to blue in the twinkle of the light ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been observing a celestial body of some type.  PD));32.3777;-82.9688
