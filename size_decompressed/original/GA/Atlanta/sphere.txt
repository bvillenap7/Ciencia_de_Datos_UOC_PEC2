Awakened by a orange glowing sphere floating in my bedroom in 1986.;1986-06-01 02:00:00;2 minutes;Awakened by a orange glowing sphere floating in my bedroom in 1986. This event happened many years ago, but I have never been able to forget it and am reporting it because I would like to know if others have ever experienced anything similar. I was deep asleep in my bedroom when I was suddenly awakened by a orange glowing sphere hovering near my dresser. It was the size of a dinner plate, had a faint orange glow, and was somewhat transluscent. At first I thought it was a beam of light that someone was shining into my bedroom (I was in college at the time), but my curtains were shut.  I noticed that the light rays did not bend when it floated near the corners of my furniture and quickly realized that it was 3 dimensional sphere of light just floating around. I suddenly became very frightened and got a strange feeling that it was looking for something. Here is where it gets even stranger - I bolted out of bed in total panic and ran into the hall to turn on the light. My screaming had awakened my parents, and when I flipped on the light switch, the ENTIRE HOUSE interior lit up in a brilliant white flash (like an enormous camera bulb flashing) and then the electricity went out for several minutes. Although no one else saw the sphere, my mother witnessed the bright flash and became frightened herself. She had been awakened by a strange crackling low hum (as she describes it) about a half hour before my incident, and had actually gotten up to look out the window to try and see where the noise was coming from. She saw nothing and said the noise lasted for about 5 minutes. After reading so many UFO sighting reports that mention a correlation between a UFO sighting and an electrical disturbance, my interest in trying to resolve what I saw in my bedroom in 1986 has provoked me to research this event further. Whether it was just ball lightening or of extraterrestial origin, I need to know.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Daytime sighting of spheres over Midtown Atlanta.;1997-04-04 02:15:00;4 minutes;Daytime sighting of spheres over Midtown Atlanta. I was taking off work early to take pictures of Hale-Bopp in a rather dark part of the state, SW of Atlanta, later that night. I don't recall the exact date, but Hale-Bopp was pretty bright, the weather wasn't too cool and it was mostly overcast and windy (westerly) that day and clear that night (around Columbus, GA). Anyway, I left work in Midtown Atlanta and as I approached my truck I looked up at the sky, hoping it would clear by night and noticed in a clear area first 3 objects that were stationary in a triangle formation and then a 4th object that was nearby them and to the south of the three. I saw these objects as I was facing the west and they were to the NE of me, pretty high up. They where all alike, silver spheres and intially were stationary. They looked like many of the objects in home movies objects seen in Mexico. I framed them against a tall building to see if they were moving and they were not. The wind was moving the clouds at a pretty good rate so I didn't think they were ballons. They seemed above the clouds. Then, one by one, they slowly moved to the south. As they started moving and with all the cloud cover, I lost them pretty quickly. I wished I had a pair of binoculars and the next week I put a pair in the truck. The next week, looking for the objects as I was heading to the parking lot, I saw a similar object that with the naked eye looked like a silver sphere. It was lower and moving faster then the first objects that had seemed to almost drift. Through the binoculars it looked like it had a small red tail. The only thing I could think of is that it was a helicopter. But the original group seemed too high for helicopters unless they have pressurized cabins. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Dark sphere underneath clouds moving east to west - afternoon.;1999-03-30 14:30:00;1 minute;Dark sphere underneath clouds moving east to west - afternoon. Was driving on Howell Mill Rd. that afternoon on the way back to work on Antone St. Saw a dark object/sphere with naked eye that was moving slowly from north-east to south-west. Sphere was to the west of Howell Mill Rd./the Atlanta Waterworks. I stopped my vehicle and tried to find out what this object could be. Then the sphere stopped in mid-air and hung underneath the clouds. I only saw the object with my naked eyes, but it was round/circular and had no wings or rotors or tail or tailwings ... it was just a round sphere. Observed it for about a minute just hanging there. The size of the sphere was at that distance about 1/16 of a full moon. Distance to sphere was about a mile. Dark/black in color. I then very quickly left the area to pick up a camera and binoculars, but the sphere was gone by the time I came back ... (from now on I will try to keep a camera with me at all times). I am a professional commercial photographer in Atlanta, and this is my fourth observation of an UFO over Atlanta. Previous sightings include spheres/stars moving, and a meteor fireball.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Two silver and bronze metallic spheres were witnessed from aircraft approaching Atlanta airport;1999-07-15 16:00:00;5 seconds;Two silver and bronze metallic spheres were witnessed from aircraft approaching Atlanta airport While approaching Atlanta airport, estimating 10,000 to 20,000 ft altitude, two spheres from beach ball size to mabey three times that diameter, flew under the aircraft on the same flight path but in the opposite direction approximately 100yds from the aircraft.  The spheres were metallic in color(silver, bronze, brown) and were traveling toward the aircraft at the aircraft's approach speed or higher.  They were witnessed about 5 seconds apart.  These numbers are estimates only since it's difficult to judge the sphere's speed relative to the aircraft and also the size. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness has considerable training and experience in a technical subject.  We suspect the description above is quite accurate.  PD));33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
UFO fleet of 40 plus objects some connected by tethers float across Atlanta clear daylight skyline.;2001-10-15 13:00:00;10 minutes;UFO fleet of 40 plus objects some connected by tethers float across Atlanta clear daylight skyline. My wife, two guests from Denmark and me were sightseeing in downtown Atlanta.  This was a very bright, clear, deep blue, cloudless day in October a month after the WTC disaster.   We were all standing on a street corner right next to the downtown Atlanta post office and I looked up into the beautiful sky to take in all its glory and as I panned across the top of the Westin Peachtree Plaza hotel something caught my eye.  I saw what appeared to be a fleet of UFO's noiselessly drifting across the sky in a Northwest to Southeasterly direction.  It was an incredible sight to see at least forty or more objects floating at the same speed, silvery white in appearance contrasted against this crisp, beautiful deep blue fall day.   One of the most amazing views of what appeared to be inexplicable objects that I never would imagine I would see, ever.  There is one detail I have left out till now.   I would estimate that from these forty plus objects at least one third of them  there was a similar, silvery white “tether” or “cord” that connected between two of the spheres.  This was a very unusual sight.  From the distance I stood from these craft, estimated at approximately 5,000 feet, the “tether” appeared at arm’s length to be the size in diameter of thread used in sewing.  The objects themselves appeared to be the size of a very heavy “period” one would produce with a pencil on paper, held at arm’s length.  When I called attention of this remarkable sight to a local street vendor I was surprised at his reaction.  There was relatively none.  He could care less.  I thought this to be very odd behavior.  He looked up and as quickly as he looked up he went back to his business of selling handbags and sunglasses without uttering a single word.   Our friends from Denmark saw this and remarked that it looked like someone holding “parachute exercises”.  The parachutes of forty plus sky divers over Atlanta at 5,000 feet up, without a single hint of descendi! ng?   Highly unlikely!   This was a curiosity that has stayed wi! th me to -date and I just wanted to report it here and now.  I listen to you on the Jeff Rense show every single time you are on.  I didn’t want to be one of those 99% you talk about that does not report their sightings.  I always wanted to see the typical saucer shape craft with a dome on top.   Little did I think I would see an entire “fleet” of UFOs.   I’ll keep my eyes peeled over-head in hopes that I will someday catch a glimpse of my ideal saucer.  Until then, thank you for letting me share my experience of some 8 years ago.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  It appeared to be a shiny ball,heading to the southeast at high speed.;2002-05-18 14:00:00;5 to 7 seconds;On the afternoon of May,18, 2002, at 2:20 p.m., I was sitting in a lawn chair enjoying the fine weather. There were a few scattered fair weather clouds floating by, but for the most part the sky was clear and blue. Suddenly,in the northwest,something caught my eye.It appeared to be a shiny ball,heading to the southeast at high speed. Not a disc on edge, but a ball! At arms length, I estimated it to be the size of a BB. If it were manned and surely it was,it probably was at least 8 ft.in diameter. It flew across 50 degrees of sky in 5 to 7 seconds. It was NOT a Mylar balloon or a weather balloon. Its course was straight and true. It must have had intelligent control as it passed over the western edge of Atlanta,Ga. and through the airways and the traffic patterns of Atlanta's Hartsfield Intl. airport.

Fourth object was flashing.;2004-07-19 22:00:00;continuing;4 objects sighted within a period of one hour. Looked like faint moving stars. (Not satellites). Fourth object was flashing. It's still continuing. 3 of them looked like satellites, but no satellites were crossing Atlanta at the time. In other words, they appeared to be faint moving stars. The fourth one was flashing. The first sighting was in one specific area but the other three were relatively in the same area. The last sighting(fourth one) was around 10:35pm Eastern Standard. They appeared to move from South to North.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Similar craft spotted again. Second sighting within a week. Check my first report;2004-07-23 21:50:00;10 minutes;Similar craft spotted again. Second sighting within a week. Check my first report This was similar to my encounter a few days ago, only that each craft moved in completely different directions. The first one was a star-like looking object with a 1 second interval flash very similar to the fourth craft I saw a few days ago. It moved fairly slow from South to North. The second one was identical without a flash and moved from West to East. The third, identical appearance, except it moved freely wherever it wanted. It started from the South and strayed towards the Northwest zigzagging a few times. This time my girlfriend was with me as opposed to my last encounter. She witnessed 2 of the 3 craft. I'm sure it's still continuing because I saw three within 10 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Ring of lights floating over Midtown, Atlanta;2009-08-08 21:10:00;45 seconds;Ring of lights floating over Midtown, Atlanta While out having dinner, seated on the patio of a local restaurant, I saw an object shaped like a circle with a ring of circular lights underneath floating above the tree line. I asked my friend to look, and he too saw the object in the distance. I looked like the object would have be directly above 5th street near Piedmont Ave, but from our view was still close enough that we were able to clearly make out the shape, individual lights underneath, and the color of the lights was white with a slight bluish hint. It moved in a fluttering pattern like a feather would if you drop it. We watched for a couple seconds until it eventually drifted out of view behind some trees. Other people would have had to have seen this object as it was just a little after 9 PM on a Saturday in central Atlanta. Tons of people were out and about.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
I spotted what looked like three UFOs blinking orange and white, which made strange patterns across the sky before vanishing at once.;2009-11-12 08:17:00;2 minutes;I spotted what looked like three UFOs blinking orange and white, which made strange patterns across the sky before vanishing at once. November 12, 2009  My dad and I were driving in Atlanta, GA (Dunwoody to be exact) when I spotted something blinking orange and white in the sky. I knew it couldnt be a plane because several planes flew by and looked much different and closer to earth. The blinking object was making strange patterns across the sky, before zooming away super fast and was gone altogether. Nearby we thought we may have sighted two fainter blinking objects as well. They all seemed to vanish at the same time.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
White spherical orb seen from airliner.;2010-04-23 13:00:00;5 seconds;White spherical orb seen from airliner. I was sitting on a commercial jet flight in a window seat located just ahead of the wing on the left side.  I was gazing out the window when a white object caught my eye.  It was traveling in the opposite direction and about three times as fast.  I lost sight of it under the wing and then spotted the object again as it came back out from behind the view of the wing.  Just then it made a large, graceful, consistent right hand arc and sped away.  I watched it for e few seconds until it disappeared into the horizon. I would describe it as a perfectly round, bright white, featureless ball about the size of a large washing machine.  It zipped by under the left wing about 400 ft. down and was traveling very fast (several hundred or maybe a thousand mph?)   As it arced a turn to the right it didn't deviate in altitude or in speed whatsoever, it just changed direction.  I was struck by how fast and how smoothly it moved through the air.  It looked like it was riding through the air on invisible rails or something.... Just REALLY fast and REALLY smooth... Not jerky or wobbly at all.

5 sphere objects in the sky no lights and moving to slow to be a plane.;2014-05-18 20:33:00;10 minutes;5 sphere objects in the sky no lights and moving to slow to be a plane. Went outside because we noticed a police drone hovering outside over midtown just off our balcony over peachtree street northeast and 11th st.  As we were on the balcony we noticed in the much further distance to the south/southeast very high in the sky 2 then 3 then 5 black sphere shaped objects moving way to slow to be planes.  They also had no lights or anything on them like we can see from the planes circling heading to and from the airport. They continued to move very slowly in the same direction.  Two we lost sight of then remaining three held a perfect triangle shape until a third seemed to disappear in a clear section of the sky and the last 2 moved behind a cloud and then were gone. Objects were to far in the distance to pick up on my camera.  Exact points in the sky can be referenced from buildings and towers in the same direction of the sighting;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Large stationary high altitude object above SW Atlanta Sky in broad daylight;2014-10-10 15:30:00;45 minutes;Large stationary high altitude object above SW Atlanta Sky in broad daylight Mid-afternoon, full daylight I spotted a spherical object in the SW sky. The object appeared to be much higher than aircraft presumed to be flying at approximately 30,000 ft cruising altitude. I would estimate about 50,000 ft and appeared to be larger than commercial aircraft. The object appeared to be stationary.  I site lined the object with the plumbing vents on the roof of my house for confirmation.  A neighbor was in the adjacent yard.  He also saw the object very clearly.  I also called a friend who is a Government Building Inspector.  He was able to pull into a parking lot and also saw the object. My girl friend arrived while the neighbor and I were viewing the object, and she also saw it.  We were amazed that it was stationary for over 45 minutes before the angle of the sun and cloud cover concealed it.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Around 4-5 pm in the middle of an amazing song, everyone was enthralled by, someone next to me pointed to the sky and said balloons.   At first we saw a few balloons...orange blue yellow clearly balloons that colored with strings on them...I turned around 30 seconds later.  And what seemed like a bunch of balloons behind the close balloons all of sudden were white dots floating up down left and right...  Not a ton of movement.  It seemed as if they were watching/listening/feeling the festival.   I've never seen anything like this so and I've always been interested in these kinds of things, so I decided to report it.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
