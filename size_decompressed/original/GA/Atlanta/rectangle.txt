LARGE HIGH BRIGHT WHITE STATIONARY THEN MOVING;2003-06-22 18:00:00;3;LARGE HIGH BRIGHT WHITE STATIONARY THEN MOVING AROUND 6:00 PM, LYING ON MY BACK RELAXING NEXT TO POOL, WITH NEIGHBOR SWIMMING IN POOL. PERFECTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LOTS OF AIRCRAFT BEFORE AND AFTER.  I SAW A PLANE THAT SEEMED TO BE FAR BELOW IT.  MOVING FAST BUT THIS OTHER THING WAS NO MOVING.  SAW BRIGHT WHITE OBJECT VERY HIGH, LOOKED LARGE, MOTIONLESS,. DIRECTLY ABOVE NORTH EAST ATLANTA. TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE ITS SHAPE BUT IT STOOD OUT AS IT WAS NOT MOVING FOR 2 COMPLETE MINUTES WHILE I WATCHED IT.  DURING THIS 2 MINUTES  I POINTED OUT THE OBJECT TO MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR, HE ALSO WITNESSED IT.  I THEN WENT INSIDE TO GET BINOCULARS EXPECTING TO SEE A BALLOON- COULD NOT FIND THEM SPENT ABOUT 3 MINS SEARCHING - WHEN I CAME OUT IT WAS GONE . NEIGHBOR SAID IT STARTED TO FLY SW AND DISSAPPEARED FROM SIGHT AS IT WENT HIGHER AND HIGHER - GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER - HE SWEARS TO THIS. NO CONTRAIL AT ALL. BUT FLASHING LIGHTS - DAYLIGHT, FULL SUN.  HE COULD BE FOOLING ME BUT I WITNESSED WHAT LOOKED LIKE A VERY LARGE VERY FAR AWAY OBJECT - RECTANGULAR SHAPED - NOT MOVING AND IT WAS VERY VERY STRANGE.  CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN THIS PROBABLY MAN MADE OBJECT I SAW YESTERDAY - FLYING VERY HIGH - TOO HIGH FOR A HELICOPTER?  OVER ATLANTA.? I AM SURE IT WAS EXPLAINABLE.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Rectangular Gray Object Seen over Atlanta GA;2009-02-02 14:00:00;approx 3-4 min.;Rectangular Gray Object Seen over Atlanta GA I was exiting the Wachovia Bank at 2942 N Druid Hills Rd NE Atlanta, GA 30329, across from the Toco Hills Shopping Center at approximately 14:05, facing SW.  It was an overcast day, with intermittent showers.   As I was opening my umbrella, I noticed something in the air.  Looking carefully, I see a boxy, rectangular, dark gray shape tumbling through the air.  There was no sound coming from it, and it appeared to be a long way away.  It, for all intents and purposes, looked like a bag inflated with some lighter than air gas that had been released, and yet it did retain its shape rather well.  I reached for my digital camera in my pocket, and took three pictures (I will include these as attachments).  I also took a short video clip (about 1:01), but nothing was obvious when I watched it later.  Approximately 3-4 minutes after I first sighted the object, it disappeared into the cloud cover. I must say that I may not be the ideal witness for such an event.  I am a science fiction fan, as well as an amateur digital artist.  I have also been described as,  slightly out of touch with reality.   However,  I do not make up stories like this.  I am not a glory hound, nor do I believe that aliens visit our planet.  Based on our present understanding of physical law, visiting even a relatively near star (like, say Alpha Centauri, 4.3 LY away) would be a tremendous undertaking.  So, my personal beliefs belie an extraterrestrial origin.  However, It was definitely something that was flying, and I have no idea what it really was, therefore it meets the requirement of being a UFO, in my book.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Orange and green lights in southwest Atlanta.;2014-08-23 23:30:00;3-5 seconds;Orange and green lights in southwest Atlanta My son and his friends were outside last night - which was a clear and cloudless night sky when two bright lights flashed in the sky.   It was extremely bright and flashed orange and green (another friend said orange and blue).   They described it as being as close as the top floor on a twenty to thirty floor building and each light being about the size of a two car garage door.  It was bright enough to lite up the sky.  At least our neighborhood it flashed twice and went away.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
