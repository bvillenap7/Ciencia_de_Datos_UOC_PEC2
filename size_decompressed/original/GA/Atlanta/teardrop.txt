Large green glowing light, size of the moon in the sky over Atlanta GA Travelling NW crossed GA-400 about 02:40 in the morning.  Appear;1999-11-09 02:40:00;25 seconds;Large green glowing light, size of the moon in the sky over Atlanta GA Travelling NW crossed GA-400 about 02:40 in the morning.  Appeared to be travelling about the same speed as an jet but no con-trail, just a glow. It disappeared over the horizon. I may be off by a day 8th vs. 9th as to which morning this happened on but I'm pretty sure it was the 9th. I was going home from work after the a late-shift about 2:30 or so, heading North on GA-400. I just passed through the tollbooth about a mile back and everything lit-up with a wierd green light.  It was like a green flare had just lit up the road all around.  Maybe thats what it was?  If so it was a BIG flare! Anyway, I looked up and saw what looked like one of those little nyquil cold capsules magnified about a million times flying overhead.  It was glowing and radiating a lot of light but I didn't see a con-trail like the jets or a falling-star has. It didn't streak across the sky.  It appeared to be flying steady. I thought, well there's something you don't see everyday. I watched it travel from SE to NW and over the horizon for approximately 15-30 seconds. There weren't any other cars on that 2-4mi. stretch of road with me but I caught up to some traffic few miles up. Well, I just thought this was an interesting phenomena and wanted to see if anyone else had seen it too. Thanks for your time.
