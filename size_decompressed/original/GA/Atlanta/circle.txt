More than 50 bright objects disc-shaped in formations of 2-12 moving towards the North-northeast for a total of about 15 min;2000-11-23 21:30:00;about 15 min;More than 50 bright objects disc-shaped in formations of 2-12 moving towards the North-northeast for a total of about 15 min Formations of between 2 and 12 disc-shaped white-yellow lights (as seen with binoculars), at first bright as they appeared in the sky, then dimming as they were moving towards North-Northeast. All seemed to be of identical shape and size.  In total, over 50 of these lights were seen by 3 scientists (including one B.S. and 2 Ph.D.s), and 2 professionnel high Tech people (including a MBA graduate from Harvard University), and by an 13-year girl.  The last formation disappeared behind clouds which started to move into the area.  The whole episode laster for about 15 min.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Bright, stationary, white light appears low to ground and then vanishes over outdoor concert in Atlanta, GA.;2002-07-30 21:35:00;2-3 seconds;Bright, stationary, white light appears low to ground and then vanishes over outdoor concert in Atlanta, GA. While at a Bonnie Raitt/Lyle Lovett concert at Chastain Park Ampitheater, I saw out of the corner of my eye in the NW sky what appeared to be a low flying helicopter with a bright light on.  I thought this was odd considering that it was in the middle of the concert.  This caused me to look up and directly at it for futher investigation. What I and two other concert goers (sitting in the row in front of me) witnessed was a very bright, intense, circular white light.  It did not emit a beam.  It was restricted to the source.  It was stationary.  There was no sound and no other visible structure.  2 seconds after my full gaze was upon it, it completely vanished.  I searched the sky for an explanation (i.e. other lights, planes, helicopters, etc.) but the sky was completely empty. Clouds were clearly behind the object, much higher above.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Report/description:  Noticed first at approx 45 degrees above horizon at North-west direction. Noticed commercial aircraft flying in vicinity. Had a disk shape and seemed to be reflective--it was flashing at close to regular intervals and sun was to my back. I watched its path in the sky for approximately 5 - 10 mins. i noticed it appeared to travel below the con trails from airliner traffic in vacinity. disked shaped object with no apparent wings. lost ability to track visually when object passed by overhead and traveled away close to sun (combination of object receding from sight and glare of sun preventing me to continue viewing it.) it did not appear to make any sound. viewed from a field within metropolitan atlanta area (georgia tech campus).  Characteristics of Object:  There aircraft in vacinity  Dorm room phone: (404) ((number deleted))  I have reported this sighting via telephone.

Two separate dots in the sky merge into one and continue in straight line.;2006-10-23 14:45:00;~ 5 min.;Two separate dots in the sky merge into one and continue in straight line. I was lying with my 2 year old son on the grass looking at the beautiful blue sky -- one of those cloudless deep blue skys.  We were in the shade of the house.  I noticed a small dot moving accross the sky.  It reminded me of a sattelite that you can see at night moving accross the sky.  This one was pulsing and moving in a straight line high in the sky.  It was very hard to tell how high it was, but it was moving in a general southerly direction. I looked a little further ahead in the path it was headed and noticed a second dot.  This one was not pulsing and was moving much more slowly.  All of a sudden, this appeared to be something spectacular.  The first pulsing dot was moving right toward the second dot!  I watched as it approached, and as the 1st dot got closer, it circled 3/4 of the way around the 2nd dot, then they became one dot.  I don't remember if they pulsed after they merged or not, but they continued at the slower speed of the 2nd dot until I could no longer see them.  The dot moved too far south and I had to get out of the shade of the house, then the sun was too bright to see. At the time I didn't know who to tell.  I wasn't too good on the web at the time.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
UFO over ATLANTA appears near downtown;2007-05-08 08:00:00;10 minutes;UFO over ATLANTA appears near downtown This object was round and small and looked as if it were changing colors or flashing and moving slightly faster and stabler than a helicopter, it was lower and slower than a plane should have been flying in that area and moving away from downtown in a southwesterly direction over the area of town known as Vine City and over and past the A.U. (college) center of Atlanta.  The early morning sky was clear blue as I viewed this object while sitting in my parked car behind the Georgia World Congress Center facing west.  After flying into the distance and getting smaller, it seemed to just disappear.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Witnessed bright stationary object on the edge of a cloud suddenly dim and finally move upon chopper and two jets presense.;2008-07-25 21:45:00;10 minutes;Witnessed bright stationary object on the edge of a cloud suddenly dim and finally move upon chopper and two jets presense. My father and I spotted a stationary object about 20 - 30 degrees off the horizon just above and to the right of Dobbins Air Force Base. This round object was very bright and appeared to be sitting on the edge or lip of a cloud. After a few minutes of video taping this sighting, a helicopter comes into view and upon doing so, the object dimmed it's lights but was still visible. A couple seconds after the helicopter presense, my battery on the camcorder went dead! My father ran in to get another camera as I stayed and watched the object. I then saw what appeared to be two very fast aircrafts come flying out of the A.F.B. up into the sky. A minute or so afterward, the bright object begings to move toward my right (north) about 20 degrees and then toward me (eastwardly). The object then moved right again and out of my view (behind a building). This was the last I saw of this u.f.o. The two aircrafts I saw scramble a few moments earlier then flew back into the Dobbins A.F.B. airspace and looked to be coming in for a landing. Around 10 or 15 minutes after this event, there were a lot of airtraffic in the Dobbin's vicinity which is highly unusual. I videotaped afterward, another helicopter flying around and two big aircrafts (looked to be military ) fly out of Dobbins. I recorded these events on a VHS camcorder and I will convert to digital format and send in.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Piedmont Park: Circular UFO with Blue Lights!;2009-06-26 21:30:00;20 seconds;Piedmont Park: Circular UFO with Blue Lights! We were on our way for dinner, and while on the 10th street near Piedmont Park my sister-in-law pointed out what we are quite sure was a UFO.  We could see it clearly through the left-back-seat-window, as it wasn't very high.  It was moving around quite fast, though smooth and steady enough for us to see that it was circular in shape, and had numerous blue lights on the bottom.  Furthermore it seemed to be of greyish/silverish color.  It was headed for the opposite direction, so we couldn't see it for long and make a video or even attempt to follow it. It is quite unbelievable to us that we may have seen a real UFO.  We have considered many normal explanations including: fancy spot lights, though if that were the case, we should have seen a beam of light under it, which we didn't Likewise even a UFO remote control toy:  I have seen a remote control UFO toy, though I am sure it couldn't move around as fast, or over such a long distance in such straight strokes, besides be able to fly over buildings!  Plus it wouldn't be able to support the extra weight of the blue lights. We tried looking around on the net if anyone else had seen it, because there were many people in cars around, and some even on foot. Who knows maybe some security camera around there filmed it, hopefully!;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Airport...and I was in the passenger seat...I am a business owner and a very reliable person and know the differnce between planes and clouds, etc...I was just relaxing and looking up through the sunroof at the clear blue sky...(No clouds around) when I saw a large Defineately GOLD ROUND CIRCULAR DETAILED METAL OBJECT appear slowly from the highest part of the blue sky,it just appeared to be coming through the blue depths... way up ...must have been the size of 5-10+ planes in width, at that height...(It was motionless...stationary... and just appeared out of the clear blue sky?).... (There were No Clouds anywhere around it)I stared in amazement and did not attempt to distact the driver at that time...thinking maybe this is just something that is explainable...no camera...but...before I could get my! cell phone to take a picture... it seemed to slowly dissappear back where it came from ...with no movement ,except a little fog taking it back up ,into and above, the blue sky??? At first I thought maybe a satellite had come into orbit and then back out??? But this is not possible, and they are not gold and as detailed as I saw... after researching...this thing was big ,it was so detailed and defineatley a large metal object...I am dumbfounded and at the same time want to know what it was... I waited because I am just scared to tell people what I saw....;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Very bright orange glowing object noted Atlanta, Georgia airport area.;2013-05-30 21:15:00;~1 minute;Very bright orange glowing object noted Atlanta, Georgia airport area. 5/30/13: While traveling through downtown Atlanta, Georgia on highway 75 at approx 9:15pm, one bright orange/red light noticed in northern sky traveling south.  Light appeared to pulsate regularly, to a brighter light.   Object was circular, with no sound noted, and was traveling separately from the many other aircraft coming into the airport area at that time.  Appeared to be lower than other planes in area, and not interfering with their flight paths.   Object appeared to ascend into sky, then disappeared.   One observer in car with previous AF history noted that the object was not a fixed wing, or rotary aircraft, saw an orange pulsating light at bottom of aircraft.  He stated that the aircraft itself as an opaque, translucent type material, with darker “lines” ,  egg-shaped, with bottom of “egg” cut off by orange light.    At least five planes noted in surrounding area sky appearing to be on approach to land at airport, but in holding pattern with landing li! ghts on to the north of city.

Completely fixed like a star is in;2015-05-29 18:30:00;40 minutes;We noticed a bright object in the sky during the day.  It was strange because it did not move at all.  Completely fixed like a star is in the night sky and about the size of a really bright star but during the day.  The intensity of it grew at which point a second smaller fixed object appeared next to it.  As the original bright object decreased in intensity the smaller one faded away and eventually the larger one slowly disappeared.  The object had a bright white color with a small amount of orange mixed in it.  Was so unusual.  It did not  move which makes me think it had to be outside of the atmosphere as if it were celestial.   Me and my co-workers were astonished by the event.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Seven 'Light spheres' - in synchronicity moving in the sky - unlike anything my wife and I have ever seen.  Ever.;2016-06-19 02:45:00;30-45 minutes;Seven 'Light' 'Spheres's' - in synchronicty moving in the sky - unlike anything my wife and I have ever seen. Ever. Sunday, June 19th – approximately 245am   Location of sighting:  Midtown, Atlanta, GA, (30308)   My wife and I were (sitting) on our front deck.  Second floor front deck.  In the midst of a conversation we were having about her work department (a rather important natured dialogue), my wife said to me,  “Babe- oh my god-babe.. look” (verbatim).  She stood and pointed directly past me – west, north west – I got up and turned toward the direction she was pointing at – the direction toward the sky. I turned and looked and saw SEVEN (I eventually counted) rotating lights in the sky- I (we) immediately thought they were Hollywood style sky spotlights – the ones you would see in the sky for a premier of a show, a movie.  But they were not: too late in the morning –way too late. We continued to watch these “light-spheres” and could only make them out –with the eye –when they passed through the moving puffy clouds.  Meaning that they only made themselves apparent when passing through the clouds.  When they didn’t pass through the clouds there was ZERO trace of them.  They passed through the clouds in incredibly bizarre formations-they bounced off one another–we watched for 20 minutes (approx.) until the clouds passed. It was simply surreal.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
