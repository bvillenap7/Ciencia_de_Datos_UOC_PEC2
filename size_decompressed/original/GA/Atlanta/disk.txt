While driving SE on Ashford Road, my brother and I saw the outline of a saucer-shaped craft just barely above tree level to our right (heading South). There was no sound and there were 4 porthole-size lights blinking in sequence from left to right: blue, white, red and yellow. The craft disappeared behind some trees and that was the last we saw of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
A saucer shaped ship was seen from about 50 yards away.  It hovered.;1978-10-14 07:00:00;15 minutes;A saucer shaped ship was seen from about 50 yards away.  It hovered. That evening I saw bright lights in my window through closed dark curtains.  I opened the curtains to view a perfect flying saucer. It was shinny, like seemless stainless stell, or chrome.  It was still daylight, so it was crystal clear, and a beautiful day.  It was approaching dusk, so the light was perfect.  The ship hovered directly over my neighbors house, which was directly across the street. It had round or oval lights runninig around the bottom, and a blue mist drifting from the center bottom area.  This was daylight so the blue light was only clearly visible when it moved up, and away.  When I saw the disk I stood inshock for a minute, but then I ran into my parent's room (wher they were laying with my little sister with them watching TV) and screamed to them to come look.  When we opened the front door the ship was still above the neighbor's home, but started to move east after a 30 second viewing by my 3 other shocked witnesses.  It took off West, but then zoomed striaght up at dramatic speeds, and then zig zagged off onto the horizon.  It was silent.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Fast Silver Craft  over Atlanta May 15th 1999. Saw craft through binoculars. Speed near Mach 3-4. Craft seemed to self-illuminate. Dayl;1999-05-15 18:27:00;7-10 seconds;Fast Silver Craft  over Atlanta May 15th 1999. Saw craft through binoculars. Speed near Mach 3-4. Craft seemed to self-illuminate. Daylight. I was sitting outside my studio in the sun reading a magazine. After a while I put it aside and leaned back looking at the blue sky with some great clouds moving around in no particular direction. I wore Vuarnet Skilynx sunglasses which has a deep yellow filter that enhances the sky beautifully. Half an hour later I discovered two dark objects floating upwards on the distant sky to the north. I brought out my binoculars (Bushnell 10x50 wide angle, 341 ft at 1000 yrds) and could see two sets of three black dots that seemed to dance upwards on the sky. Figured in the end that these must have been some kind of balloons. As I was following these objects with my binoculars there was suddenly something that streaked across my field of vision. Something bright. I quickly followed the thing with my binoculars and managed to keep my eye on it for 7-8 seconds. It looked like some sort of silver colored self-illuminated craft that was shaped like a wedge, and it had darker flowing lines running along the ... fuselage. Front to back. The front end was pointed and the rear was somewhat rounded. It looked like a formstudy from design school. Furthermore it had no visible wings. Nor did it give any exhaust. There was no sound from the craft. The color was silvery and shiny - even with the sun behind it. It lacked normal shadows. The speed I can only estimate to Mach 3-4. Maybe somewhat faster. It flew in a straight line from north to south. Its altitude was around 10.000 to 15.000 feet. It eventually went behind some clouds, but did not come out on the other side. My location was 1/2 mile north of Atlanta Waterworks on Antone Street, and the event took place west of me. I have also submitted a recreation of the event in a photo-digital format to the UFO Reporting Center.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Base to watch the jets make there mid- night runs. as I waited I kinda thought hum i'll just sit on my hood to get a better view. So after about 10 min. a c-5 Cargo jet came in and landed , as it did i noticed a few army choppers landing as well. I thought to my self man there's alot of fuss over that c-5 i wonder whats up w/ that thing. so i walked across the street to get a better look and view so i waited 30min or so to let it get stopped in front of the hanger at the middle of the run way. As the c-5 stopped i noticed guys in what looked like a light grey army fatiges run around the plane and hanger. thats weird i thought. why would they be acting that way well while this unfolding the wind had blowing about some all night. and as they unloaded this large craft like cargo the tarp caught wind and lifted just enough for me to see a round shaped craft that seemed to glisten in the hanger lights almost like it had a slight glow or some thing and quickly the soldiers covered it up and a unloaded in to the hanger and thats it i feel crazy writeing this cause nobody believes me they say you saw a jet but i know what i saw and that was no jet no way.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
The saucer was flying south, parallel to I-75;2003-04-26 17:00:00;30 seconds;The saucer was flying south, parallel to I-75 While riding north through Atlanta on I-75, I noticed an object just below the clouds and flying south.  At first I though it was a plane until it rotated and it did not have wings that I could see.  Having observed planes flying into the Atlanta airport all afternoon, this object stood out because of the altitude it was flying at, and its size, which was smaller than a plane would have been.  After observing this for approximately thrity seconds, it changed direction and went west, and that was the last I saw of it.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

The best way that I can describe the craft is…if you hold out a coke bottle at arms length…that’s about the size it was. It was gray in color and did not move. I went to grab my phone to snap a picture of the craft. When I got my phone and looked back up it was still there. I drove under a sign that hangs over the interstate, once past this sign the object was gone. Never did see it again. The weather was perfect. No clouds in the sky, bright sunny day. Air temp around 60 degrees.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Disk shaped aircraft with bubble top illuminated from within, orange pulsing light on underneath, hovering south of I-75 near Atlanta;2010-10-22 20:00:00;continuing;Disk shaped aircraft with bubble top illuminated from within, orange pulsing light on underneath, hovering south of I-75 near Atlanta Friday evening at night fall I was driving north on I-75 (Atlanta, Georgia) but was still south of Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport.  To the west of I-75 I would say a couple of miles or so away – difficult to judge distance when the object is in the air – I saw a large illuminated craft hovering in the sky.  At first I thought I was seeing an airplane coming in for a landing I was driving and trying to look at the same time.  It was evident that the object was NOT an airplane although it could have been the size of a small plane.  The object was disk shaped and looked to have a bubble top.  There was an orange colored light on the underneath side that pulsed maybe every 10-15 seconds.  I was intent on getting to my destination in Atlanta so I did not pull over or exit the Interstate to investigate – wish I had.  I look for a logical explanation – have never seen an object in the air that I could not identify and thought that this object should be a! blimp or an advertising attention getter.  I was told that there has been a blimp in that area for around a week, but I saw that blimp and it is the wrong shape, not illuminated from within, and the light it has is on top of the craft and pulsates more frequently – and the blimp is on the move, not hovering.  I never saw this other aircraft move.  I was only able to observe it for probably 2 – 3 minutes as I was driving, but it was unusual to the extent that I thought I should report it.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Large disc over downtown Atlanta.;2015-08-10 23:00:00;30 seconds;Large disc over downtown Atlanta. From my window, on the 7th floor of my apartment building in downtown Atlanta, I noticed the dark silhouette of a thick disc shaped object over the Westin hotel, it appeared creased in the middle, and hovered.  Judging from the distance from my window to the Westin I could approximate the height of the object as being 1000 ft or so from the ground.  I shined a staples laser pointer at it, and it slowly flew south west over the city and banked out of view to the West. Also judging from its height and flight trajectory over buildings I know the distance to, I think it was at least 30 ft in diameter and perhahps 8-10 ft tall.  I also noticed some odd looking red flickering lights in one of the adjacent skyscrapers while the disc was present.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
What is it?;2016-11-04 09:31:00;Picture;What is it? I do not know what this is but would like an expert to look at it.  I was at Atlanta airport in one of the smoking rooms.  Likely concourse A or C.  The picture is taken through glass.  I did not notice this in the photo until now and I did not see it the day i took the picture. I don't recall round lights being in the smoking room however there could be and it may be a reflection.  Just seems odd.  You can see the shadow of me in the glass.  It is not in the picture taken a few seconds before.  About 20 seconds apart.  I am emailing pictures.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
