Several bright disk-shaped objects moving North across the sky;2000-11-23 21:30:00;15-20 minutes;Several bright disk-shaped objects moving North across the sky Several disk-shaped objects moving North across the sky.  Bright at the onset which could not be cleared positionned due to trees and then slowly fading away such as when reflecting light and moving away from the light source.  The first sighted objects (2) were followed by a formation of about 8 to 12, then a pause and then a new formation, this repeated several times.  The object were moving against the wind in the upper atmosphere above the cloud covering which was coming over the Atlanta area at that time.  The fading away of the object could have been due to the clouds.  It is not possible to define if the brightness of the objects was due to their own light or if it was reflection from the sun.  The objects were disks shaped as seen with low powered binoculars.  No noise but this may have been due to the distance.
