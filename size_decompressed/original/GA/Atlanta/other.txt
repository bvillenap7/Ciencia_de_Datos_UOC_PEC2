It was about 2338 when I was backing up into a dock.  I had my window down.  The tail of my truck was facing due north and I was facing due south.  Atlanta airport is close by and several aircraft are circling to land.  Something caused me to look up and saw a cresent shapped object streeking across the sky.  It was bright white and was leaving a brief trail behind it.  It started going streight but then appeared to go upward.  It lasted about 3-5 seconds at most.  It appeared to be gaining speed and slightly rotating.  It then disappeared.  Sorta agh struck.  Only though was Kewl what ((dleeted)) was that? Oh, there was no sound at all and it was about 1/3 the size of the moon.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
ME AND MY FRIENDS WERE AT THE PARK AND WE SAW TWO FLASHING UFO'S IN THE SKY;2001-01-23 09:00:00;30;ME AND MY FRIENDS WERE AT THE PARK AND WE SAW TWO FLASHING UFO'S IN THE SKY WE WERE SITTING AT A PARK AND I NOTICED A LIGHT SITTING ABOVE THE TREES. I DIDN'T PAY IT ANY ATTENTION AT FIRST. THEN IT VANISHED. I THOUGHT IT WAS A PLANE SINCE IT WAS GONE. THEN I LOOKED IN THE SAME AREA AGAIN AND THE FIRST ONE  WAS BACK WITH ANOTHER ONE BOTH GLOWING REAL BRIGHT AND FLASHING GREEN BLUE WHITE AND PURPLE. I TURNED TO MY TWO FRIENDS THAT WERE WITH ME AND I POINTED IT OUT TO THEM. THEY SAW IT TO AND WE WATCHED BOTH OF THEM STAND STILL AND FLASH. THEN ONE OF THEM STARTED MOVING SLOW WHILE THE OTHER STOOD STILL. THE ONE THAT WAS STILL WAS FLASHING AND GETTING BRIGHTER AND BIGGER IT SEEMED. THEN THE ONE THAT WAS STILL STARTED MOVING AND STOPPED AND THEN MOVED AGAIN. IT KEPT DOING THIS FOR A WHILE. THE FUNNY THING WAS THAT THEY BOTH LOOKED LIKE THEY KEPT ON DISAPPEARING AND REAPPEARING. BUT THEY WERE NEVER GONE FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE. WE WATCHED THEM FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. THE ONE THAT WAS MOVING THE WHOLE TIME WE WAS THE ONE WE SAW LAST. IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS MOVING AWAY FROM US AND GETTING HARDER TO SEE. THE OTHER ONE VANISHED ALL THE SUDDEN. WE DIDN'T SEE IT MOVE, IT JUST VANISHED. THE CRAFTS LOOKED LIKE CIRCLES THAT WERE FLASHING.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Hovering still curved boxy  20x25 ft. solid dark object over Atlanta freeway.;2008-02-16 12:30:00;2 seconds;Hovering still curved boxy  20x25 ft. solid dark object over Atlanta freeway. In full bright daylight I observed a curved boxy matte black solid object floating stationary in mid air 50 feet above the freeway in midtown Atlanta, GA from my 5th floor window. It was slightly above my eye level, 200 - 400 yards distant. The object was still. It just appeared and then disappeared without apparent motion 2-3 seconds later. The object was a fluted boxy cylinder, the side I observed had a matte black or very dark grey finish, with 4 vertically aligned portholes 1/3 down from the slightly curved dome at the top. The sides were parallel with fluted curved sections each with a shadowed porthole, matte black and indented. Each of the curved panels was 5-6 feet wide, each porthole 3ft wide by 4 ft high. The object had horizontal ovals 2 by 5 foot at the bottom of each fluted panel, which extended slightly below the bottom plane of the boxy thing, all the way around. Its overall height was about 20 ft. from top to bottom.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

I was on Delta flight 1307 from Richmond to Atlanta.  I was sitting on the left side of the plane in a window seat.;2012-09-23 19:30:00;2-3 seconds;I was on Delta flight 1307 from Richmond to Atlanta.  I was sitting on the left side of the plane in a window seat.  About seven minutes prior to landing I saw an object outside the plane.  It was moving at a good speed and passed under the wing.  It seemed close to the airplane but not close enough to hit the plane.   It had a circular, aqua colored top that appeared hard and a light, silver colored, narrow cylinder coming out of the bottom of it.  In terms of size it was not larger than the wing of the plane.  I’ve Googled weather balloons and it was definitely not a balloon.   I told the people beside me I saw something weird and they started joking around and making reference to the X-Files show.  I laughed out of nervousness.   I reluctantly asked the guy behind me when we landed if he happened to see anything odd from the plane and he said he said he saw it as well and that it freaked him out and that he was just going to pretend he didn’t see it.  He said he was ex military and it was definitely not a stealth probe.   He agreed to go to the pilot afterwards with me.  We told the pilot and the flight attendant at the front of the plane what we saw.  The pilot said it was probably a balloon (which it was not) or a tower on the ground (which it was not) and that they would check it out.   The other witness and I were surprised that they didn’t ask for our names or info.   Let me state that I have never believed in UFOs, etc. prior to this.  I don’t know if this is something being tested by our government or another country or if it was really other-worldly.  I can only describe what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be exceptionally eloquent, and objective in her description of the sighting.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.  PD));33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Craft releases smaller object which then vanishes into thin air above Atlanta, Georgia;2015-09-13 15:30:00;1 minute;Craft releases smaller object which then vanishes into thin air above Atlanta, Georgia This craft, black in appearance seemed to be a curved craft.  It came out of the clouds, hovered, dropped a smaller object which after falling a short distance from the mothership, seemed to vanish into thin air.  I saw this report on youtube, which includes pictures and a video.  A link in a comment under the video leads to a very clear picture.  A friend of mine has a friend who may have seen this.   I will update with more info soon. Link to youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geWuVytGqPw;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Extreme speed across the sky from a long distance, not the ISS.;2019-07-24 22:30:00;15 seconds;Extreme speed across the sky from a long distance, not the ISS. A relatively faint light, looking like a night time distant star moving very rapidly across the night sky from north to south.  It was not the ISS as I looked at the schedule.  I have seen the ISS fly over my house and even though it seems to move quickly across the sky, this object was noticeably faster.  If it was an aircraft at high altitude it was moving extraordinarily quickly!  I have never seen a distant object move this fast across the sky, including the ISS.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
