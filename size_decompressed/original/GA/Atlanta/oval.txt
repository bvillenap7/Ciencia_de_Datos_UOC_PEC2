Fastest moving object ive ever seen;2002-07-03 17:00:00;2 seconds;Fastest moving object ive ever seen I was walking down the street with a couple of my freinds and I just happened to look up and saw a green pulsating object slowly hovering in a backwards j type movement as soon as i noticed the object it stopped the pattern it was flying in and shot off towards the sky not straight up but at and angle untill it dissappeard out of veiw the whole thing happened in less than 2 secounds and before i could say to hey look at that it did not make any noise or seem to even disturb the air around it. this object was at about low helicopter hovering altitude. never in my life have i seen an object move that fast and ive seen shooting stars, comets and jets blimps every thing I am an extremly rational and skeptical person but that day changed my perception on this UFO phenomena foreever i don't know what they are but they are very very real ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Sighting during Atlanta morning rush hour;2004-07-15 07:00:00;6 seconds;Sighting during Atlanta morning rush hour Driving to Atlanta, the morning after my wife’s brother died, for my wife’s brother’s funeral with 3 children in the car, it was about 6:30-7am. We were at a standstill in morning traffic on the main interstate coming from Florida. It was a clear morning with no clouds in the sky.  Not moving in the traffic, I glanced up in the sky to my left and saw, very clearly, a shiny silver, object about the height and size as if a helicopter was hovering over the morning traffic.  This object had no propellers though and no wings. It hovered in that position. I turned my head to watch the slowly moving traffic. Then I quickly turned back to the object. It didn’t occur to me what I was seeing.  The shape was that of a blimp, but smooth, shiny and reflective like polished chrome.  I turned to watch traffic again and move as needed. When I turned back to see the object it was gone. I looked around and didn’t see it near by.  If this had been a plane flying into Atlanta’s airport it would still be visible making its way as would a helicopter.  This object disappeared from sight altogether.  My wife’s son also said later that he believes he saw the same object.  With thousands of cars stuck in morning traffic, I can’t believe that I was the only one to see this.

They all had blinking lights and were round in shape via the orientation of the bright orange lights when I took photos.;2012-10-21 22:00:00;45 minutes;I saw several craft emerging in ones and twos, all from an area south of me and going in the west direction, passing the city skyline.   They all had blinking lights and were round in shape via the orientation of the bright orange lights when I took photos.  Some were appearing to be large upon entry from the south but then the got smaller in diameter when passing the city skyline.   Some of the craft doubled back towards the direction that they initially came from and some just hovered in certain spots.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Light in the sky close to North Druid Hills.;2014-06-21 23:00:00;5 minutes;Light in the sky close to North Druid Hills. I was working my dog when I headed back home when I looked up in the sky and saw two lights following very close to each other.  When the lights passed me in the sky not more than 15 seconds later, two more lights followed right behind them and then two more lights a total of six lights.  If they were planes they were following very close to each other very close.  But I didn't hear any plane noises.  They were yellow and red in color.  I never saw anything like it these six oval shape lights were very close to each other ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I saw a bright dot in the western sky, two attached circles white and silver visible only with binoculars.;2015-08-03 08:00:00;10 minutes;I saw a bright dot in the western sky, two attached circles white and silver visible only with binoculars. I was looking for birds from my deck with a binoculars, and I stumbled on this bright dot in the western sky.  I could barely see it naked eye, but it was Ok with the binoculars.   My wife and niece watched too.  It was hoovering and moving a little bit left and right (south and north).  I couldn't make out very well the shape, which looked like a to spheres attached one to the other.  The color appeared to be white and silver.  It was very far high in the sky.    That day there was a good amount of commercial airplanes flying from East to West, south of my observation point.  It doesn't happened every day to see that many planes in that point at that time, it might be a route that is taken due to weather or else, and by the way the weather was perfect that morning.  Anyway, at a certain point I am not sure where it went but it was not there any more.   I don't know what I was looking at, my niece (21 y o) doesn't either, but she says she saw a UFO.  It was a UFO to me, at least, I don't want to jump to conclusions.    Considering the shape (to spheres attached one to the other) and the fact that it was not moving and it appeared to reflect light (at that time 8 am the sun was low in the eastern sky and was shining toward west hitting this object which was reflecting the light).  It was very difficult to spot, I saw it by accident.  I don't expect many people having seen it too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
