TIME & PLACE: The event happened Saturday morning approx. 3:00am December 5th 1998. Did not have a watch at the time, but estimates that to be the correct time span. Came home from work and had just parked my car. As I walked toward the apartment I saw this bright light coming from ABOVE TOWARD THE GROUND. This event took place South-West (correction) from MY location in the North-Eastern Buckhead area which is about 6 miles north-north-east of downtown Atlanta. LIGHT & SOUND: The object was glowing red, and as it streaked toward the ground the tail seemed to ignite. The colors of the tail that followed were bright neon blue at its core, and toward the yellow and red spectrum closer to the edges of the fire/explosion. The tail seemed to ignite after the object had passed through the same space, and remained glowing in the sky for about 1 to 1.5 seconds after the main object crashed all the way toward the ground. The object itself was glowing bright red. I estimate the brightness to be one large sized unit of exploding fireworks. Maybe even somewhat brighter. I heard no sound (contrary to what others witnessed two days later Sunday night with another fireball). There was no streetnoise otherwise in the area. SIZE: The size of the red glowing object was no larger than 1/16 of a full moon, and the streak was approx. 12 inches in length from the edge of my hand when outstreched in front of me.((Name deleted));33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Saw five of them. Winessed 5 fireb Witnesssed 5 fireballs streaking across the sky in the Atlanta area on 12/14/99 between 21:30 and 22:30. About 5 seconds each from different directions. alls streaking across the sky in the Atlanta area between 21:30 and 22:30 on 12/14/99. Came from different directions and lasted only about 5 seconds each. Saw a bright fireball in the night sky about 21:30 in the north Atlanta area.  It was Yellowish-orange  with a little blue on one side.  Very bright and moving incredibly fast- much faster than the planes in the area.  It appeared out of nowhere and disappeared from view within about 5 seconds.  Biggest, brightest, fastest moving thing I've ever seen in the night sky. I thought the meteor showers were over for now, but that's what I would have guessed it to be. Went inside.  Came out an hour later and saw two more within a few minutes of each other.  They came from different directions and were slightly smaller and less bright than the first one-or perhaps a little further away. My husband saw a fourth one- more like a flash of light.  We then saw a fifth one, much smaller and white instead of yellow- looked more like a shooting star. I am guessing there were probably many others which we didn,t see, since I was indoors after the first one, and didn't come baack outside for a hour, when we saw the other four.  Also, there have been heavy contrails made in this area every day in x and circular patterns- all day.  When I drove from Atlanta to Nashville last week, there was heavy spraying the whole way- kept hoping to outdrive them but they were all the way to Nashville-even over the rural and mountainous areas.  What,s going on up there? Lots ofpeople getting sick and staying sick in both areas, as well as in Virginia where there is also heavy chemtrail spraying- They're calling it the 100 day cough in Virginia.  Any connection between all these things?.  I have heard about UFO's before, but never was sure I believed it.  But these fireballs were really there-quite beautiful actually. ((NUFORC Note--The annual Geminid Meteor Shower, which was particularly bright this year, peaked on this night, and the night before.  The direction of flight of the object described here is not inconsistent with a meteor from that event.);33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Green streak of light sighted in Atlanta, Ga. around 9:30 p.m. on Monday, October 20;2003-10-20 09:45:00;2 seconds;Green streak of light sighted in Atlanta, Ga. around 9:30 p.m. on Monday, October 20 I happened to see reports about a green streak of light sighted on Monday, October 20, 2003 around 8:45p.m. in Raleigh Durham. My wife and I saw the same streak of light around 9:30 p.m. just for a couple of seconds. It looked as if it was heading towards the ground. We dismissed it as a firework, particularly a Roman Candle.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Fixed bright white dot seen near Atlanta Airport, Feb 28 from aircraft.;2007-02-28 18:00:00;40 minutes +;Fixed bright white dot seen near Atlanta Airport, Feb 28 from aircraft. I had a window seat on a small 50 person passenger plane.  We were making our approach to Atlanta Airport, but still about 75 miles out.  I saw a bright dot outside the window that I took for Venus because it was sort of scintillating.  Despite the fact there was complete cloud cover that night, I still thought it was Venus somehow breaking through.  It was too bright to be another aircraft, unless it was pointing a landing light right at us.  But it couldn't be Venus, because we were moving in relation to it.   I watched for 15 minutes, on and off again, as we passed it.  It must have been as far as 50 miles away, so it took time, but it wasn't fixed like Venus would have been.  And, it didn't move at all, like another aircraft would have. 20 minutes in, we were coming in for a landing and I could still make it in the distance.  Even at that distance it was brighter than all the other incoming planes.  It was mostly a bright white dot, but I could make out shades of red and yellow that occasionally shifted.  Waaaaaaay too high up to be a radio tower of any sort.  I had a camera, but thought what's the point?  It would just be a dot. P ease contact me if there were other reports or if there is a logical explanation.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
glowing red spaceship flys at car;2010-01-02 23:47:00;3 seconds;glowing red spaceship flys at car  500 Lights On Object0: Yes It began with a flash of bright light in the sky. at first i thought a plane had malfunctioned, caught on fire and was falling out of the sky. But it started to curved towards our car. At this point, as if by magic, our car had shut off, including any lights that were in the car.  Also, our friend in the backseat was thrashing around and mumbling some wierd language. If the ship had not have come so close to our car, i would have passed it off as a government test or somthing like that.  But then the ship started to gradually speed up and change it course so that it was aimed directly at us.  Our friend in the backseat was thrashing so violently now, the car felt as if an earthquake was centerd directly next to us. Suddenly, right when the ship was about to hit us, everything went white. I couldn't feel or hear anything besides a high pitched ringing in both my ears. It was like i was dead for 10 seconds. I can honestly say it was the scariest moment in my enti! re life. When we all came back to our senses, the entire car was extremely hot to the touch. The ship was gone but I can still remember the glowing red surface of the ship though. If you're wondering, the friend in the back was there, sitting straight up. He still isn't the same person he used to be.

Green  fireballs 2 different sightings over Atlanta.;2013-08-27 17:00:00;5 seconds;Green  fireballs 2 different sightings over Atlanta saw this same greenish fireball with a long white tail 5 months before this sighting near 285-S/20-E (15 mile distance from my first sighting.  I've noticed I am always alone when seeing this, bit I inform my mate and he says I am delusional.  I wish like I didn't have to try to prove I'm not crazy.  Reading everyone else's reports has comforted me and literally has me frightened...... I had a nervous breakdown now having knowledge of what it was that I saw.
