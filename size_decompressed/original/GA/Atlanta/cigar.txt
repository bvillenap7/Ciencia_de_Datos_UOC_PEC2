Driving down Houston Mill Rd (near Emory University/Emory Village) around midnight, perhaps a little before, my friend nd I saw an intensely bright light in the sky directly ahead of us.  We assumed it must be a low-flying plane, but it was extremely bright and as we speculated on what it could be (I suggested a helicopter searchlight--it was that bright) we drove under it.   Again, at first we thought it was a plane, but then we realized it had no wings and was simply a dark, oblong shape in the sky (could not tell if it was moving or not) with five green and red lights around the edges and a bright light in the front, or what I assumed to be the front.  We kept driving and soon could not see it.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

As my greyhound bus was entering Atlanta, GA, from Tampa, FL, (while escaping hurricane Irma), I saw it fairly low in the sky and close enough to see clearly.  It seemed to be hovering in one spot and it looked like it could have been larger than a passenger aircraft.  There was no distinguishable front or end to the craft, it looked as though the ends of the cigar shaped craft were flat.   It did start to look like it was drifting farther away from the greyhound bus, but not because were were on the highway, but because it was drifting directly away from the highway, going Eastward, even though it was pointing North/South.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

What really made me report it though was the distance it was covering.  Like 15ish miles a second and when I did some calculations that would be close to 60000 mph.  Which is ungodly fast, there also seemed to be some intelligent maneuvering going on which makes me believe it wasn’t a rocket.  (It continually changed direction) although I’m no expert in weapon systems.  It could have been nothing but it seemed odd, odd enough that I wanted to research and report it.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
