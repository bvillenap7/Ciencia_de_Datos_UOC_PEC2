dark, smokestack like objects jutting above clouds, seen from an airplane;2005-12-19 12:00:00;10 minutes;dark, smokestack like objects jutting above clouds, seen from an airplane 15 minutes south of Atlanta in a plane, looked out window to the west - complete white cloud covering - looked like 2 thin dark smokestacks and 2 larger cylinder type objects jutting through the clouds.  I thought they were smokestacks but then realized we were far too high (didn't land for another 15 minutes - commercial jet).  They weren't moving.  I kept watching as we passed and looked to see if anyone else was looking out the window (no!)  Have no idea what it was....;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Space shuttle with chemi-trail head upwards;2012-05-10 18:30:00;5 minutes;Space shuttle with chemi-trail head upwards Was driving I-85 south by 14th street. Looking west it look a single splotch of isolated chemi-trail. Looking closely it looked kind of like a conventional NASA style space craft traveling up wards. But the  trail only went so long and never longer. I think there were four boosters.I even have a crappy picture of it. It appeared to just sit still in the sky which makes Me think it was real far away.maybe it was a satellite or something.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Cylinder object seen near Downtown Atlanta.;2013-06-21 20:00:00;1 minute;Cylinder object seen near Downtown Atlanta My girlfriend and I were heading home when she noticed a strange object in the sky. She told me that the object wasn’t like an airplane, since we live near Hartfield International Airport.  I looked for a place to pull over to get a better look.   As we came to the top of the street near an open field, I exited the car to look for the object.  Between two trees, slightly below the treeline, facing East, I saw a white/silverfish cylinder shaped craft/object hovering in the air.  It looked to be metallic because of the way the sun reflected the light.   From the distance I observed it at, it had to be nearly ½ mile long.  It hovered without a sound for a few seconds, shifted to the right slightly, shifted to the left then shot out of sight to the left (towards the South).   I just stood there amazed.   The object was gone before I had a chance to get my camera up.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
