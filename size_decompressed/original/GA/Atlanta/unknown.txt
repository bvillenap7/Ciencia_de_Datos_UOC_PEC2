Orange colored beings thats possibley from another planet;1984-06-30 12:00:00;aliens;Orange colored beings thats possibley from another planet what i remember is around 1984 when i was in (Sally K) pre-k we where on our way on a field trip. There was maybe about 10 of us on the van with 2 adults.   Into our long road trip when i noticed that we made a wrong turn down this rocky area i saw big spins of electrical wire, big rocks and a small like maybe a security both.  The driver of the van all of a sudden paniced and spinned the van around in a great speed. As i looked out the window of the van i saw 2 but maybe could have been more.  i cant remember if they where short or tall but they where orange colored people dressed in all white suits.  Their heads where big, and it was plain as day that they where not from this planet.   This memory pushes my intrest in the UFO phenomenon and i would really want to know what it was i saw;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Fast moving white light;2005-11-26 13:15:00;1-2 seconds;Fast moving white light I guess this wasnt as interesting as most sightings and there was no reason to suppose it was some alien spacecraft. I am just trying to figure out what it could be. I was in my car, driving about 30 MPH and I was the only car on the road. I was in the city and it was too cloded to see any stars at all. I just saw this white speck.It looked a lot like a light on a faraway airplane...very bright, white light.I couldnt really tell how far up it was but it traveled in a trajectory from right over my car straight in the direction I was facing and behind the buildings in front of me. It was only visible for a second or two, so it must have been traveling some incredible speed, Id say 10-20 times faster than an airplane. There was no sound and no trail. I second guessed myself that it was some reflection on the window but really I could tell that it was not, I saw it very clearly and its velocity seemed to change perfectly inverse with its distance. Considering downtown was roughly to my left it seems it was traveling west. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

While sitting on the swings i noticed a large Red/White/Blue light pulsating about 25 miles away in the sky. I figured it just to be a plane, and i asked my girlfriend, ((name deleted)), what she thought it was and she figured it was the light pole on top of Stone Mountain. The object's lights where in a pattern just like this... Red  White  Blue. I still thought it was an airplane, until the lights all fused together making a brilliant shade of red and green. The object then began to move left to right in paterns that no modern day aircraft could handle. The object dissapeared behind trees, but reappeard seconds later much closer to us. The object seemed to be about 200 feet off ground about 200 yards away. As soon as it appeared it dissapeared behind the trees. When it reapeared it had to have been 60 yards away at about 150 feet off the ground. I was trying to capture this in Sarahs camera phone, it was moving slow, and made absolutely no noise at all. I could only see the two lights on either side of it. Then it vanished.  I could no see the object very well, but the light formation leads me to believe it looked something like this..  o<^>o  o = Lights V I have never seen anything like this, it was probably one of the most amazing events to ever happen in my life. WE managed to get a photo of the object on my girl's phone, but it is only a camera phone and does not offer very detailed quality.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Two bright crafts hovering & moving together in clear mis day;2011-03-13 15:00:00;4:00 Minutes;Two bright crafts hovering & moving together in clear mis day I went to my local driving range because it was a fantastic spring like day. I popped the hatchback to sit and put on my golf shoes.  As I was putting them on my attention was drawn to the really large American Flag almost directly above me.  I could see a normal chem. Trail going right behind it and thought it was cool looking.  This is why I was looking up. I have (knock on wood) great vision. 20/20 – And I saw two objects in the sky near another jet (not the same one that had the chem.  Trail behind the flag but a similar jet that I see in Atlanta all the time).  These crafts seemed very silver – at times the sun reflected off them – and slowly.  They seemed small, but far and very silver.  I knew right away that they were not normal crafts that I see in the air.  They were very very high in the sky.  They hovered like helicopters but didn’t look or move (left, right, up, down) like a helicopter would.  The other point I really want to underscore is they moved tog! ether.  They seemed to keep the same distance from each other and traveled in the same direction – but that direction was not just east or west – more like zig-zag –quite slowly.  I never saw anytime of spinning or jets – they were real still. I watched them as far as I could as they got smaller.  It was something I will remember forever.  It was such a clear day and such a clear image to remember. And so unlike anything I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Sometimes there was an aura coming off.   It was flying south past Piedmont Park, then turned west.   Two more followed.   It is a clear night.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Lights are elaborate on craft.. reminiscent of a diamond flickering in the sunlight.. always near the airport;2014-10-19 01:00:00;20 minutes;Lights are elaborate on craft.. reminiscent of a diamond flickering in the sunlight.. always near the airport Craft sits perfectly still and flashes multiple colors( like a diamond flickering in sunlight ) near the flight/landing track the planes take going into the airport..  I stay near the Falcons stadium.. the planes come in and make a huge U-Turn from heading eastbound toward the south.. at first I assumed that it was a a helicopter.. but i've seen helicopters leave from near Grady hospital and there is usually just one yellowish light that is on.  These lights on this craft flash in color from white, to red, to blue, to yellowish, to aqua..  i've seen this same craft a few times in the distance as the planes come in on their track toward the airport.. Hopefully i'm not misidentifying this this craft.. it could be a helicopter with an elaborate light fixture that monitors the planes landing and has lights to make sure its visible to all planes coming in?.. I will try to send a video next time I see this.. i've seen it a few times.. I've also witnessed a satellite ! in passing.. I have a keen eye and i'm able to discern what can be explained and what can't..;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
White dot spotted in the sky stationary for a number of minutes then zoomed off.;2016-10-25 15:45:00;3 minutes;White dot spotted in the sky stationary for a number of minutes then zoomed off. While out for an afternoon walk with my wife and 3-month old twins, we noticed a white dot in the sky.  The object appeared to be in a location that was not the place for a plane or helicopter to be.  The object also seemed to be too big to be a drone.  I own a couple of drones and so I am familiar with their shape, size and flight characteristics.  This white object was stationary for a number of minutes and then zoomed off.  We lost it behind a building.  A video (sorry, iPhone only) was taken at the time.
