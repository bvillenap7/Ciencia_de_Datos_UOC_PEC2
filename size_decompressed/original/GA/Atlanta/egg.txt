An unusual large black cloud had been exahausted from engines (and twirled by the aircrafts prop wash) and continued as a trail of black smoke was following the copter (traveling south slightly east of hartsfield airport).  Thinking that the aircraft was in trouble I has some interest in watching it.  The sun was coming up and illuminated both the copter and exhaust trail.  I then noticed a small (egg) object at what appeared to be a very high altitude (1:00 very high). I thought it was probably a jet flying directly over Atlanta and catching the sun, but it was unusual because it did not have the usual contrail and was traveling south very fast (same direction as aircraft but at what appeared to be a much higher altitude). The object was reflecting the sun like a mirror.  The object disappeared for a second and then reappeared (or I saw a second similar object) traveling east (12:00 high) at a high rate of speed.  The object zoomed east and out of sight in less than a few seconds. Time is an estimate +- a few minutes.  Sunrise was just starting.  Objects appeared to be very very high.  Aircraft was thumbnail size and appeared to be very high for a cargo type helicopter. Egg shaped object was about one quarter of thumbnail size (very small).  *If* the object had not moved so fast and *if* the object had a contrail, I would have thought it was a military jet traveling at such altitude you could only see the sun reflecting of the aircraft.  BUT, this object was small and FAST.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Floating, silent panel of lights;2003-09-17 20:30:00;3-6 seconds;Floating, silent panel of lights My wife and I were jogging last night around 8pm. As itâ€™s been getting dark earlier, we decided to jog through our own neighborhood. At about 8:30pm we were heading west down Old College Way. I glanced up and saw a panel of lights almost directly overhead. It was moving slowly and silently from west to east. It seemed to be approximately 1000-2000 feet off the ground. There was no erratic movement at all. After a few seconds the lights dimmed out, almost as if they had sensed me watching. The sky was very clear and once the lights went out, I could not make out any dark silhouette. My wife had not looked up in time to witness anything, but suggested maybe I saw a shooting star. As we looked at the sky, a small private jet went overhead, heading almost due north. It was quite audible and its black silhouette was easily identifiable. It did not appear to be chasing or even aware of the lights. My wife repeated that it must have been a shooting star. However, the lights were very clearly defined. They were three horizontal rows of six lights each. The lights were perfectly round and almost looked light a panel of stadium lights floating in the sky. They were very 3-D looking. They appeared to be angled over the ground at about a 30 to 45 degree angle. There was a definite dark shadow behind the lights like a short, stubby cigar, though the lights themselves seemed to be flat on the same plane. My most immediate thought was that I was looking at the Goodyear Blimp, but the moment the lights dimmed out, the black shape vanished as well. From my experience at football games, I have been able to hear the blimp even over the crowd noise. Whatever this was, was dead silent. The image I have included is a rendering in Photoshop of what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally lucid, objective, and credible.  We have invited his wife, who also saw the object briefly,  to submit a report, as well.  The witness was certain, he said, that the object was not any type of blimp.

I then went unconscious and woke up on the ground 800 yards from my house with a scar on my leg and one on my stomach as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
