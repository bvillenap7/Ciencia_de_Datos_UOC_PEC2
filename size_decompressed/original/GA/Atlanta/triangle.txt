We were looking in the sky for the moon and couldn't find it.  We were watching a low flying, large airplane that was flying overhead which is unusual for this area.  My daughter looked down to talk to me and at that time I saw 2 triangles sort of adjoining or maybe it moved so fast it just looked like two.  It just suddenly appeared (maybe it was behind a cloud?) and before I could tell my daughter to look into the sky, it sped off at a right, upward angle into the night.  As far as the size, it is hard to describe because of how high it was, but compared to the airplane it was about 1/4 to 1/2 the size of the low flying ,large airplane that had already passed us.  It did not look like it was following it - but who knows it disappeared rather quickly.  I could see a trail of light as I watched it, but it didn't leave a trail in the sky.  I am truly amazed and blown away because I have always wanted to see something like this.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Triangular light followed by red ball of light seen in Atlanta, Georgia;2011-07-28 08:30:00;4 Minutes;Triangular light followed by red ball of light seen in Atlanta, Georgia My friend and I were sitting outside stargazing when something captured our eyes.  We had already been outside for about 15 minutes when we saw a bright light coming towards us across the sky from a distance.  It was traveling much faster than any man made aircraft or jet plane would travel at. At first we had not a clue of what it could be but at this point we knew for sure it was not an airplane or human made aircraft of any kind.   As this object passed right above us it slowed down at a very speedy rate.  The object first turned out as a large orange ball of light going at a tremendous speed, but as it got closer it appeared to have the shape of a triangle.   We could see a large orange triangle shaped light in the center. We could also see that there were 3 blue lights moving in a circular motion around this bright Orange triangle light.  We felt almost as if something in this craft were watching us back. This object was the brightest flying object we had ever seen in the sky in our life.  The object hovered for about another minute or so and disappeared within the blink of an eye.  Not even 30 seconds after this craft disappeared an enormous solid red ball of light passed by in the same path as the other UFO we had just believed to witness.  These objects were completely silent as well and flew about 500 feet above us.   My friend and I remain baffled.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Irregular triangle cluster of 3 very bright white lights low to the west 6:35 a.m. - Southside Atlanta.;2011-08-12 06:34:00;1 minute;Irregular triangle cluster of 3 very bright white lights low to the west 6:35 a.m. - Southside Atlanta. On my way to work this morning, noticed very bright white lights fairly low to the west.   As I was driving along (north on Stanton Rd.), trees and buildings would block my view, got to a spot where I could clearly view it and stopped in the road to see if it was moving.  It was hovering but appeared to drift a bit to the south.  No sound was heard, too bright to be an airplane or helicopter, 3 bright white lights in irregular triangle formation.   A vehicle approached from my rear and I had to proceed as it is fairly narrow road and there was nowhere to pull over.  My first thought was ISS and then blimp but no structure could be discerned.  Sky was still mostly dark - I cannot begin to say what it was.   As I pulled onto the entrance ramp for Langford Frwy (166), I glanced back and saw 3 dim white lights moving at speed overhead to the east - I can only assume it was the same object as I had not noticed any other air traffic in the area.    Object  initially was approx. 35 degrees above horizon, maybe half mile away, maybe 1500 feet altitude or more.  Lights werre not spaced uniformly.  Diddn't appear to be any more than 10 feet across, if that much.   It is difficult to give good measurements as sky was dark and lights were very bright and in a triangular cluster rather than spread out as along a wing.  I have reported this also to MUFON.   I contacted Fulton County Airport (Brown Field) to see if they had a  blimp launch from there this morning (object was to their southeast).  Airport Mgr. replied my e-mail -  he has forwarded my info to the ATC tower and will let me know if they have any info.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Daytime UFO sighting, odd shaped and slow moving craft vanishes behind cloud.;2012-06-07 14:00:00;20 minutes;Daytime UFO sighting, odd shaped and slow moving craft vanishes behind cloud. The UFO was slow moving and shaped like half a triangle It was metallic - very shiny.  It was directly above me so I watched it until it moved behind a cloud but it never came out the other side I waited sometime for it to cross the cloud but it didn't  (The cloud wasn't too big so it shouldn't have taken but maybe 5-10 seconds at the speed it was moving That's it - that's what I saw - it was an airplane or Any other typical air craft - I have never seen that Shape before or the slow moving of the craft Ill swear on a stack of Bibles that I witnessed this.

Triangle with green light over Atlanta, just north of downtown.;2014-02-01 21:09:00;2 minutes;Triangle with green light over Atlanta, just north of downtown The object moved across the interstate highway as I was driving on a side road alongside the highway.  The object was triangular in shape.  My guess of its altitude is about 3000 feet.  When I lowered my window, I was unable to detect if it made any sound as the highway traffic was heavy.  Had it been an airplane, though, it was low enough that I would have heard its engines.  The light on the object was green, but it was solidly on--as opposed to an airplane light which blinks. Pulling my vehicle to the side of the road for a better view, in the moment it took me to open my door, the craft has disappeared.  I continued to look for it for several seconds, but did not see it again.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Triangular shaped cluster resembling Stars;2016-08-09 22:37:00;20 minutes;triangular shaped cluster resembling Stars First I noticed, then my wife noticed and verified and photographed a triangular cluster of three stars far above 30000 feet above the approach path for airplanes 4 Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta.  What appeared to be a triangular cluster of stars moved apart then move back together.   Could not have been a helicopter because they are not allowed to fly in this airplane pathway.   Could not have been a blimp because these were far too high. Could not have been a meteor or asteroid because they would have been inflamed when entering the Earth's atmosphere and moving.   Was definitely not a plane because we watched the lights in a stationary orbit.   We then photographed them as they separated and came closer back together.   Could not have been a drone because for a drone to be seen and that altitude, it would have to be huge and larger than a 747.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Triangle shaped black craft spotted near Atlanta, GA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness suggests Boeing drone.  PD));2017-10-26 11:30:00;2-5 seconds;Triangle shaped black craft spotted near Atlanta, Georgia. While flying from Atlanta, Georgia, to Minneapolis, MN, spotted a solid mat black triangle shaped craft flying at a speed of approximately Mach 2 at an altitude of 31,000 feet.   The aircraft was  flying towards the commercial aircraft I was in and passed on the right side of the aircraft approximately 500 yds away and 1000 ft lower than my aircraft's altitude.   Triangle shaped craft bore no markings and no stabilizers or visible fins.  The craft appeared to be smaller than most fighters or personal aircraft and appeared to not have a cockpit of any sort.   The craft appeared off the forward right side of the aircraft I was in and then disappeared under the right wing. As far as I know I am the only one to see the craft.   I am in the military and I study aircraft that are operated by the U.S. Military.  This craft does not match any current operational military aircraft. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, I did not inform the aircraft crew of the sighting.  For some reason the thought never occurred to me.  I have done some research however and I have found a prototype aircraft that is very similar to the aircraft I spotted.  The craft that I found is the Boeing Phantom Ray which was produced 7 years ago in St. Louis, Missouri.  I hope this helps some.  Thank you for your consideration of my report and timely reply.
