Light stationary in sky then ascends at incredible speed at abt 45 to 55 degree angle;1993-02-03 18:15:00;Less than minute;Light stationary in sky then ascends at incredible speed at abt 45 to 55 degree angle Can only give an approximation, but know it was before Feb 4, 1993, possibly on the 3rd.  Don't remember the exact time but it was early twilight so probably between 6 and 6:30 PM(?),  the sun was below the horizon, no glare remaining, just a gradated deepening evening blue.  We were heading west on Ponce De Leon toward Midtown and I was a passenger in the car, front seat.  I was not on any medication, nor had I had any alcohol.   A bright white light appearing to hover near a Midtown skyscraper eventually caught my attention, about a mile distant.  Don't remember the light's  approximate elevation as far as stories go but it was to the right (north) of the skyscraper, several stories lower than the skyscraper's height but above any other buildings in the vicinity.  We were on a hill going toward Midtown and I was looking pretty much straight ahead at the light, not having to peer up into the sky.  I watched the light without thinking anything about it, then began to think about it and imagined it was the bright beam of a helicopter.  As I watched it struck me that it wasn't appearing to move.  By now I was curious because you expect the beam of a helicopter to waver as the vehicle moves and to grow brighter as it progresses, and imagining it a helicopter I had begun to watch for this as it hadn't happened yet.  I was still expecting it to be a helicopter, and so had  mentioned nothing to the driver  about it, when suddenly the light ascended at an incredible rate of speed into the sky, to the north, at about a 45 to 55 degree angle. Before you could snap your fingers it was gone, that fast, from what seemed an absolutely stationary position in the sky.  No trail.  No sound. There appeared to be no acceleration.    The amount of time I spent watching the light before it zipped off may have been as little as 30 seconds, probably no longer than a minute.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Oval shaped bright light.;1994-11-15 21:00:00;apprx 20 seconds;Oval shaped bright light. I saw similar in Georgia a few years ago. Mine was, I thought the moon until I realized it was moving horizontally right at the tops of the trees very slowly. It moved from the left side of my property to in front (I lived on a hill in a very rural area of Georgia). Impossible to tell how close or how large it was. Couldn't have been far or I couldn't have seen it thru the trees. Was also about 9pm at night, clear night in November. I did call a UFO org and a very nice fellow came up from Atlanta to talk to me, he took notes but came to no conclusion. Didn't dare call the local cops since I could just guess their reaction.  When the thing came around to the front I was so creeped out I went inside. I just didn't like the looks of it and I was isolated and alone there on the property. No neighbors within sight or hailing distance and 1000 acres of lumber company land to my right (where it was heading).  Memory gets less trustworthy thru the years of course but I would guess it was about the size of a quarter held at arms length. What the rising moon would look like at any rate, pale, no flashing lights or sound at all.  Updated information to above sighting report below:  It was in Banks county Georgia, I'm about 50 miles above Atlanta.  I had gone out to bring the cats in, around 9:00 in November, clear as a bell outside and saw this thing thru the trees. I thought 'oh how lovely the moon is' until I realized it was moving horizontally and not at all in the right place for the moon, I of course said something like 'oh s*' and just stood there in total amazement and watched it very slowly circle my property from the left of my house to the front, across the pasture.. The trees were bare so I could see it clearly and it stayed right at basically the same level. You are right it was too big for a helicopter and a solid softly glowing object, no flashing lights no noise, So not a blimp and too close to the trees for that also.....I wracked my brain trying to come up with some sort of perfectly ordinary object and failed.  Why is it they are so creepy? You mention that too. When it came around to the front of my house I went inside, I honestly felt I didn't want to be around if it got closer. I don't worry about airplanes and I wasn't nervous living out in the boonies by myself (humans would be my major worry there), but that thing made me nervous after that, about wandering around at night. On one hand though you want to see it again because you just can't believe its not something known, and perhaps the second time it might reveal itself.  I enclose a picture of approximately where it was when I went inside, it was about to go into the trees to the right and I figured I would either lose sight of it or it would move toward me. In reviewing this picture it was probably more the size of a dime held at arms length rather than a quarter...at any rate MUCH too big to be a star....hmmm swamp gas maybe....but what the heck is swamp gas -)  Don't forget me if you get some ideas, and God Bless for taking those sightings. Its important to get them down and believe me it helps to discuss these weird things with someone else. I would like to thank this witness for her report, as i very much appreciate you sending it into me.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

A  blue grayish kind of light.;1997-10-15 03:00:00;5 min;Summary : A  blue grayish kind of light. It was sometime in October when I spent the night at a friends house. Sometime in the early morning hours, I had awakened and looked out the window and saw this blue-gray light that had the apperance of drifting. (No unusual noise at all.) The diamater of this light looked to be the same as a pencil. I could not see a beam of anykind, but when  I started to get up to investigate, the light turned towards me (Clockwise looking down.) and shined in my right eye. The light was not like any I have seen before. It wasn't like a doctor's pen light, the light did not cause me to squint. The light didn't have to search for my eye, it went right to in a fraction of a second. Looking into the light, I could not see around the edges and in some way it reminded of chalk. The best I can remember, I only looked at the light about 1 second. Next thing I remembered, I didn't want to get up and go to the window anymore to investigate what was out there. That isn't like me, I am the type that would be the first one there, but after the light, I kept on  thinking to myself I can get up and look, but I don't want to. I didn't at that time felt that I was held back in any way. BTW, I didn't see any kind of craft.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

The object was moving slow but it may have been moving fast but just so high about 2 feet at arms lenght for about 5 sec,  I have a very good pair of binoculars I had them in hand with in 15 sec after the light blinked out( thats just what it looked like blinkeding out) I scanned the sky for 5 min and never saw anything I was looking for navigation lights thinking that it could have been a very high flying aircraft, I saw nothing, I believe that this was strange, I do not have the math skills to figure out how high an object would have to be to reflect light two hr's after sunset, it was almost 80` in the sky almost over head. My impression was that this object was large and in space. I was not going to report this matter but after listening to you on Jeffs show I think on 4/16/00 I decided to, I had not thought that it was any big deal because of the lack of details but I had noted the date and the time in my head because of the strangness of and after listening to you the other night and you saying that it's just a story unless you report it and log it< i have decided to do so.

I did not personally observe this craft, however it was reported on the WSB TV evening news by the weather reporter Glen Burns.

It was reported on the 18:00 newscast on 03/15/01 that the station had recieved numerous call form viewers that observed the Mir spacestation and also observed another object with multicolored lights on a parrallel course with the spacestation. Mr. Burns also stated that he had contacted several agencies and noone seemed to know what this object was. It was also reported that a pilot had observed this object also, and had stated the object appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 100 miles.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

I had a schedule at hand and a good pair of binoculars. At 01:10 GMT, what appeared to be a satellite showed up in the southwest, moving to the northeast.  Unbelievably, it instantly made a 90 degree turn to the northwest. After making that instant change in direction,it began to slow down to a stop! Then I saw another,coming from the southeast on a course to join the first craft. As #2 was approaching #1, #3 showed up in the far northwest. It was not as bright as the other two and appeared smaller, but was very fast.I followed it for about 5 seconds and when I looked for #1 and #2, they both had disappeared.

white light source changing from pinpoint to much brighter size(possibly rotating space debris catching sunlight);2003-11-19 05:00:00;5 minutes plus;white light source changing from pinpoint to much brighter size(possibly rotating space debris catching sunlight) In the southeast sky about 5:00 am, approx. 60 degrees vertical I noticed a intense white light source.  The source of light did not move the entire time(5 minutes plus) and it would fade to a pinpoint then increase to a white(as though reflecting sunlight) source several times its previous size.  The duration of change was regular and it did not move so I would believe that it might be some space debris reflecting sunlight as it moved in it's position.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Single light that morphs into line of lights or triangle, then back to a light and speeds away.;2006-08-13 23:30:00;3 hours;Single light that morphs into line of lights or triangle, then back to a light and speeds away. I am a sixty year old Marine corps veteran who has watched the skies since I was a teenage Civilian Observation Corps volunteer.  I do not drink nor take drugs which would interfere with my vision. I hesitated for several weeks to report this anamolous phenomenon because sky conditions have not been ideal -- thunderstorms and clouds, not to mention the urban light scatter that makes observations in Atlanta difficult.  However this sighting has repeated itself a dozen times in the last few weeks and I felt compelled to report it.  In each occurance several hovering lights have been observed out of my bedroom window which faces almost due east.  This view looks out on a main air traffic corridor in and out of ATL (Hartsfield-Jackson International) and PDK (Peachtree Dekalb).  On these evenings I would observe the normal comings and goings of the aircraft, with their landing lights, wing lights, strobes, etc. and what I observed was obviously not an aircraft.  I would see one perhaps two lights hovering in position from just above the horizon, perhaps ten degrees, up to almost directly above.  On one or two occasions the light would appear just after a flash like a strobe,  On others the strobe flash was diffused by a high overcast.  The lights, which varied from a reddish white to a bluish white, would remain stationary for thirty seconds to five minutes, then would fade and in their place a line of lights would appear, usually canted from the horizontal, like a wing making a turn, or sometimes three red lights would appear in the same spot in the shape of a triangle, equilateral or isocoles, then would morph back into a light and move quickly, probably too quickly for an aircraft, to the northwest or southwest, DIRECTLY ACROSS the flight patterns of two airports.  It is extremely difficult to estimate altitude but would not be surprised if they were manuvering over fifty thousand feet.  As I mentioned the cloud cover made it difficult to track them completely across the sky but the consistency of the pattern is remarkable.   It did not seem to exhibit the flight characteristics of an airplane (unless a Harrier jumpjet which is highly inprobable) or a helicopter or a satellite.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Bright Red Pinpoint Of Light Traveling Across Sky;2007-07-16 01:54:00;35 seconds;Bright Red Pinpoint Of Light Traveling Across Sky I just had twins and I no longer smoke in the house and late last night while smoking and  sitting in a zero gravity recliner looking straight up I saw a pinpoint of red light moving slowly across the sky. It was very bizarre looking A tiny, tiny speck of brilliant red light traveling across the sky. Is it possible this was a satellite? The intensity of the light was incredible but the object was definitely in space, well above our atmosphere, I am assuming because of its size (it was as small as a pinpoint at arms length) and the time it took to cross the sky (I can only view about 40 degrees of the horizon in my backyard due to the trees and roof of my house) .;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

It moved slightly over the 20 minutes observed but not fast enough to be an aircarft.  The object was also far too high in elevation to be a helicopter.  It would be considered by anyone to obviously be brighter than any star or planet in the sky on even a clear night, but the clouds behind it tonight(and sometimes briefly masked by) proved it to be closer in.  The brightness and then dimming was also not the result of the clouds becasue it did this even when clear. We also caught several minutes of the light on video that reflected the pattern.

As a mechanical engineer, and a long-term skeptic, I promptly rushed to her aide, understanding that she was entranced by satellites or mesmerized by underlit bats. Much to my surprise, at my arrival at SunTrust plaza, located at Peachtree & Baker, I watched as what appeared to be stars swirled and danced, diving into one another, playing in my indigo southern sky. The lights that differed from stars only in their locomotion and lack of twinkling, were clearly above the cloud level, as they frequently would dim or disappear behind the occasional lazily passing cumulus. I can find no rational explanation for these playful sources of lumination.  From aircraft to projections, from critters to carefully-mounted LEDs, my scientific mind boggles at the concept.  They would rush from one end of the sky to the other in seconds, turn back, swirl curved paths, and even hover on the spot.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Bright object in sky;2012-02-05 20:00:00;about an hour;Bright object in sky So during the super bowl on Sunday I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and looked up at the sky as I usually do and saw the brightest what I thought to be a star.  So I called my mom outside to see it. Well upon further observation I realized that it was not a star because it was a lot lower than any of the other stars. In fact, it was in the air space as many planes flew by it and it, I live in Southwest Atlanta off of Sylvan Rd.  The object was moving at a slow pace and the thought of it being a plane was quickly dismissed because the light did not match the direction in which it was headed and there were no additional lights.  The object was in my view for a good 45 minutes to an hour before it was no longer visible.  I do have a video recording and picture that I will send as soon as I find out how to upload it from the camera to the computer. On Monday 2/6/12, I saw the same object again also during the eight o’clock hour.  I again called my mom to verify that she saw it and then called my aunt who lives a few blocks away, to look outside and see if it was visible to her.  She didn’t see it so I went to get her so she could have a look and give me her thoughts of what it could be.  She saw it and we presumed to follow it to try and get a closer look, but we were unable to keep visual contact due to the object moving and trees blocking the view.  We did spot it again hit and miss with a clear view when we got to Cascade Rd. The only reason I am reporting it is because we could not come to a consensus of what it could be and thought maybe someone else will help us figure it out.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

When it vanishes their are no clouds in the sky. I have also seen white streaks in the sky that resemble jet fume, but I never see the actual jets that  could create the streaks.

Verified oddity;2012-10-16 22:15:00;15 seconds;Verified Oddity I am a UFO enthusiast. So, I spend a lot of time star gazing. I've never before seen anything out of the ordinary. But the other night, while driving, something caught my eye. A stationary blinking light that appeared to just hover and blink. The road I was driving is quite curvy, so I slowed, and watched for about four seconds.  The blink then reappeared very far away toward the east, then once again, then I never saw another blink.  I did not mention this to anyone, my friends already ridicule my UFO enthusiasm enough.  But walking with a close friend, who absolutely does not believe in UFO's, she reported seeing something &quotweird&quot in the sky around the same night of my encounter.  She proceeded to describe the exact same event.  I found out she, though in a different car, was on a nearby road, driving the same direction, at the same time.  She described all of this to me BEFORE I told her of my encounter.  Her description matched all of my details, incl! uding a stationary blinking white light, two blinks toward the east, then no more.  She, however, was not driving and had more time to really observe this object.  I find it most unusual she told me this, since she cringes every time I try to show her anything on UFOs.

I have a video below so let me know if anyone has seen anything like this before. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SyVNa5gwAc&feature=youtu.be ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two Triangular bright white lights , and one long object lighted , all very bright. All somewhat close to each other .;2014-10-20 08:25:00;2 minutes;Two Triangular bright white lights , and one long object lighted , all very bright. All somewhat close to each other . I emailed Atlanta Fox  5 to see if any saw these lights. I have been driving this route to work for over 10 years and never seen this before.  I know someone else had to see this. I was trying to get a good picture  - but I was being honked at. By time I could get a snap of the lights  - I didn't see the lights but had snapped a shot anyways.Did not see any cell tower or building or weather balloon. Interesting and I want to know what it is.  Two bright white lights both the shape of candy corn (Triangular) shape and one longer looking light to the right of them . This was north east on 285 Interstate near Roswell Road but before the exit and past the  river . The Military base is not far from location however I didn't hear any noise - like it may have been droids.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

I observed a moving light through an aircraft's window over Atlanta, Ga.;2015-07-01 22:33:00;1 minute;I observed a moving light through an aircraft's window over Atlanta, Ga. I was on Delta Airlines Flight 1667 flying from Atlanta, GA, to Myrtle Beach, S.C.  The aircraft was a MD-88 and I was sitting in seat 19E on the starboard side of the aircraft, several rows forward of the wing, which I could see on the right side of my window when I leaned forward.  We took off an hour late at around 22:29.  There was an overcast of Cirrus-stratus or Alto-stratus clouds.  The full moon was not visible through this layer.  There were no lower clouds and city lights were plainly visible without obstruction during the initial climb out after takeoff.  There were no reading lights in use near me.  There were also no electronics in use with illuminated screens nearby that would have reflected on the inside of the window. Shortly after takeoff the aircraft leveled out and the lights of the city were plainly visible with a definite darker area extending out to the horizon visible under a slightly lighter sky over that.   At this point I was looking down at the city lights, when I noticed a light separate itself from the rest and begin to move.  It was a banana yellow color and was moving upward at a slow and steady pace.  There were no other details to it.  I could not judge its distance from us.   As it moved, it appeared to be heading on an opposite course to ours and was climbing at an angle of approximately forty five degrees.  From my perspective it moved from the lower left of the window to its upper right corner where I lost it to view.   The light became obscured by the leading edge of the wing and then reappeared over the rear upper edge of the wing or wingtip.  All this time which was probably a minute or so the light did not change in brightness or flicker.  The color stayed the sa! me and so did its speed of ascent.  I was unable to observe the object further as it went out of my limited field of view even by shifting my position. I don't know if anyone else on the aircraft saw this.  There was no apparent reaction. The young man sitting next to me on the left was listening to music and not looking out the window.  This whole thing occurred to quickly to try to get anyone's attention. During the initial takeoff before we leveled out there were other aircraft visible.  This light or object did not exhibit their characteristics.  I have flown numerous times at night and have seen plenty of aircraft leaving or arriving at airports.  This was not one of them. Its apparent point of origin was not from any airport. It was an urban environment.  Shortly after this we began to ascend again and banked for a course change.  I checked my watch and it was now 22:35. I am sixty two years old, male, and was travelling alone returning home from a family related trip.  I am a retired social worker and business manager.  I am an amateur astronomer and avid sky watcher.  I have no clue what this was.  I only know what it wasn't.  I considered raising this issue with the pilot upon landing at Myrtle Beach, but decided to avoid that and take this approach instead.  I don't know how he would have reacted, but I did speak with him about the natural fireworks of distant thunderstorms visible to our south during the flight at higher altitude which he was also quite enthusiastic about.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Spotted 12 solid red lights flying in the formation of a triangle slow moving across the night sky.;2016-06-19 00:16:00;6 minutes;Spotted 12 solid red lights flying in the formation of a triangle slow moving across the night sky. 12:16:00 am - June 19, 2016.  Approximately 200 to 300 feet in the air, I spotted three solid bright red lights flying in the formation of a triangle slow moving across the night sky from the southeast toward the west.  Another similar formation of three lights followed the previous three lights.  I observed the set of objects (6 lights total) make a deep (simultaneous) turn right toward the northwest and disappeared from view. No sound was heard. 20 seconds later-Another second set of lights (6 lights total) in same triangle shaped formation appeared from the same direction (southeast moving toward west), made the same precise turn toward the northwest and disappeared from view like the previous six. All the observed objects passed below the full moon. 20 minutes later a nondescript helicopter with red and white flashing lights came from the same direction and race off toward the northwest, too.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Saw one bright white light while grilling dinner move from SW-NE possibly bright white. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.  PD));2017-01-29 18:47:00;45-60 seconds;Saw one bright white light while grilling dinner move from SW-NE possibly bright white.   I immediately called kids outside, to see the Space Station, but realized this was much lower maybe 10K feet?  There were no other lights.  Even my eight year old daughter said its only bright white not another color to be seen for duration. I have heard you for years on shows to say to report these as we see them, and I have usually not done so, but now that time has passed. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.  PD));33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Bright light in the sky-HUGE object, going faster then anything I've ever seen, then disappeared on I-85 S.;2017-03-11 23:15:00;15 seconds;Bright light in the sky- HUGE object, going faster then anything iv ever seen, then disappeared on 85s My fiancé and I were driving down 85 south, we were speaking casually when all of a sudden a HUGE bright light went from Left of my windshield to Right.  It was going down in a slanted motion but incredibly fast.  At that moment, we were both like, Are you seeing what I'm seeing!?  It looked as if the object would crash but just disappeared.  This was a light so bright we immediately knew it wasn't a shooting star.  It wasn't a plane (nothing crashed) it also had no streak tail in the sky and no sound.  It looked way to large to be anything logical.   We couldn't believe what we just saw.  My fiancé is not a believer and was in shock from what we had seen.  NOTHING like it.  There would be no way nobody else driving on the interstate could have missed it.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Bright orb descending over I-20 at Wesley Chapel Road;2018-09-20 20:45:00;2 seconds;Bright orb descending over I-20 at Wesley Chapel Road I was driving on I-20 east away from Atlanta and a bright condensed white light caught my attention ahead and to my right, so that it appeared to be south of I-20.  The light was like a shooting star but about 20 times as bright.  It was descending rapidly at a slight angle, and disappeared behind the trees.  This was definitely not a shooting star, it was moving more slowly and deliberately than that and was too bright.  As I kept driving there was an accident that had just happened on I-20 not far from where the light was headed, although the light appeared to be heading more south away from the interstate.  Also, the trajectory was as of a plane crashing at a steep angle, or a flare coming down.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Blue light bounces across morning sky then disappears.;2019-03-29 06:40:00;15 seconds;Blue light bounces across morning sky then disappears. Stuck in downtown Atlanta morning traffic going 75 north, a blue light appears out of no where and darts across the dark sky.  The light was bouncing up and down as if it was loosing control.  Looked like someone’s headlight in the sky except it was a blue foggy light. Looked like the light was coming from behind clouds.  Happened so fast all I could say was wowwww.  Was not a plane.  The light was to big and bouncing up and down while traveling at an unexplainable speed then disappeared out of nowhere.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
Bluish-Green oblong light traveling at high rate of speed.;2019-03-29 06:52:00;2 seconds;Bluish-Green oblong light traveling at high rate of speed. Bluish-Green linear light moving at high rate of speed from east to west approximately 3 miles North of Hartsfield (Atlanta) Airport.  Crossed path of commerial flights taking off from airport perpendicular to flight paths.  So fast that it made commerial jets look motionless!  I estimate altitude at approximately 1,000 feet.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071

Red lights moving in sky In my direction, slow down rapidly then stop.;2020-05-19 21:28:00;90 seconds;Red lights moving in sky In my direction, slow down rapidly then stop. I was talking on the phone with a friend, using a Bluetooth headset.  I decided to walk out on the balcony of my 17th floor condo to finish the conversation.  While talking, I noticed that there were a few bright stars or planets in the western sky.  As I was looking at them, 2 red side by side lights to the left of the stars caught my attention, flying in my direction, west to east.  I thought it was a plane, but I rarely see planes come from that direction so it was a little unusual.  I didn’t think much about it and continued my phone call. At this point something unusual happene.  The two lights began to slow down rapidly and came to a stop.  They stopped just before they would have flown over my building and out of my view (the building I live in has 46 floors).  I thought maybe it was a drone but it seemed kind of high in the sky and I did hear any sound coming from it. The person I was talking to said I said “WTF is that?”  I told him what I was seeing and he told me to take a picture of it.  I remembered I was on Bluetooth and my phone was on the kitchen counter.  I rushed inside, got my phone, came back outside to take the pictures.  When I looked up to find the reds lights, there was now only one small red light visible, still stopped in the sky.  I took 4 pictures of the sky where the light was, brought the phone down to switch to video but when I looked back up the light was gone.  So I took a picture of the western sky where the bright stars or planet were. My friend on the phone was listening to my commentary while this was going on and said I sounded like one of those people on those UFO shows while it was happening.  We laughed if off, I couldn’t explain what I saw so I decided to drop it.  About and hour later I decided to look at the photos I took.  I realized then that I captured the red light in the photos.  I zoomed in to get a better look at the red light and took screenshots of the object in the photos.  I don’t know what it was and didn’t want to jump to conclusions.  I will email the photos.;33.8195268320961;-84.4205505102071
