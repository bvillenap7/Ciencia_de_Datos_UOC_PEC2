Bright, white object easily seen with naked eye NOT moving;2016-06-16 11:45:00;45 minutes;Bright, white object easily seen with naked eye NOT moving Went outside of office at 11:45 am.  Casually looked up and noticed bright white object in sky.  Grabbed my 10X binoculars and saw that it was circular, concave and a bright, opaque white color.  Initially thought it could be a parachute but it never moved.  I then assumed it was a weather balloon, but again, it didn't move for 45 minutes and it was very windy today.  I did grab my camera and captured many images of it and was able to zoom in on the pics, but I still can't positively identify the object.;34.5209;-83.5453
