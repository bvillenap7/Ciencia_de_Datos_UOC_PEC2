Strange objects in the sky ove Alto, GA.;2009-06-12 15:30:00;15min;Strange objects in the sky ove Alto, GA. On Friday, June 12th, 2009 I and my girlfriend witness something in Alto, Ga. At first there where a groups of airplanes flying in groups of three.  They did not appear to be military.  These planes appeared to be escorting the objects.  After about ten minutes a group of planes appeared and 2 of the objects broke off and came directly towards us.  As they got close, we could see a haze around the objects and would look like a round object with a light in the center. They were about 10 ft above us, and as the shifted away, a cloud or fog started forming and covered us.  She ran and I don’t know how much time went by, but I could smell a strange odor.  I still don’t feel right, my legs hurt and I feel strange.  My stomach is upset and repeated trips to the restroom.  I do not want any kind of media coverage, I want answer.  I know someone know about this event, why NASA scrubbed the launch on Sat. I am a professional and don’t make false claims about this type of event.  Please help me understand.;34.454;-83.6031
