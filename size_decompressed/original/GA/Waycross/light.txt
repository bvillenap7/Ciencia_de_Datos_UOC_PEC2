Moving Northwest and suddenly just goes out. A bright redish orange light moving north west slowly.Solid light no blinking at all.As i gazed at this light and the oddness of it,after 2 minutes it suddenly goes out.The sky was moon bright and up and i kept watching because the thing would eventually pass directly over me as the speed and direction it was going. It was moving with normal plane speeds i guess enough to tell it was coming on .But i saw Nothing.Yet planes were flying in both directions in same area.I went and got my wife to come see but it never reappeared.I had to go to work at 2300 and left.;31.22557;-82.3672650000001
