Observed bright lights just above treeline.  Watched it turn and move south. Disappeared below treeline, 30 seconds later it was moving north, gaining altitude, stopped, and shot straight up, disappearing from sight.  Second object was on north side of the road, again just above treeline, was visible between trees for about 1 minute. When view cleared past trees, it was gone. It appeared as if light from the ground was reflecting off bottom. But that area is very wooded, no known lights in that area. Goldish yellow in color. Approximately 300 feet across and two stories high. Lights across the back end when it turned.;31.22557;-82.3672650000001
