((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))   A weird large orange light with a tail seen and then part of it breaks off;2005-04-29 20:55:00;15 minutes;A weird large orange light with a tail seen and then part of it breaks off into two and one of the light sends out rings that look like While driving to a bluegrass concert, my husband and I saw the weirdest thing we've ever seen in our lives. We hope others saw what we did so people wont think we are crazzy or on drugs.  Well...I saidlook! pointing to sky. We pulled over and what we saw may be a once in a life time thing. This is not a lie!!!! We saw this huge orange light with a tail like a comet coming to hit the earth...then the tail faded away and the orange light grew smaller almost as small as a star in the sky with a even bigger white glow around it.  As this object moves across the sky it all of a sudden divedes into two little star objects. One of the objects continues to move while the other all of a sudden lets of these rings that grow larger around the small object and it seemed as if that object exploded but with no sound. It also seemed like it set of millions of tiny other objects.....or like some type of wave.  we then jump in the car thinking that the world is about to end...this freaked us out..but also excited me...The object that was left then continued to float across the sky....during all this there where several airplains in the sky and I wounder if anyone eles saw this. It was a beautiful thing tho see. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));31.22557;-82.3672650000001
