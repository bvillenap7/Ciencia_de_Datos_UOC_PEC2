Red lights in the sky;2010-02-18 09:00:00;2 minutes;Red lights in the sky There were 3 red lights blinking, not flying in any particular formation.  I do not know if they were helicopters, or UFOs, or what.  Initially we thought they were helicopters, but then realized that we couldn't hear anything.  Then, we saw another bright red light fly across the sky that was not blinking.  It was flying at a very fast speed and was brighter than the other 3.  My entire family saw this.   About an hour later (around 10:10), I saw a red blinking light in a completely different place in the sky.
