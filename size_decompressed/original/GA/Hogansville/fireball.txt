Fireball floating in the trees.;2017-08-05 00:00:00;20 seconds;Fireball floating in the trees. Behind barn, in tree line, half way up the tree, a round fireball was floating.  The fireball was completely visible, until a plane was headed in the direction of the fireball.  When the plane was almost over the fireball, the fireball went out.  When the plane had disappeared, the fireball started to reappear.   It was small and grew bigger and bigger until it was back to the original size.  Another plane approached and the light went out again, this time it did not come back.;33.1644;-84.9309
I clearly saw a light streak from the sky down to behind the treeline in the distance.  ((anonymous report)).;2019-05-18 22:30:00;Seconds;Driving home from work late that night.  Coming down Hwy 29 from LaGrange heading into Hogansville, and I clearly saw a light streak from the sky down to behind the treeline in the distance.  It was quick, but not moving quite as fast as a shooting star would, I've seen those many times in my life.;33.1644;-84.9309
Bright star that moved very rapidly toward the horizon.;2019-05-18 23:00:00;2 seconds;Bright star that moved very rapidly toward the horizon. There was a fairly large star that fell toward the horizon.  It moved extremely fast through the sky, so there was no way it couldâ€™ve been a satellite, meridian flare, shooting star, airplane, drone, or space capsule.  It was very far away from us in the sky.  We ruled most of those things out because there was no fire under or around it.  It just looked like a very bright star.;33.1644;-84.9309
