The object hovered in the sky and seemed to bounce.  It would move up and down and then sideways with no pattern to it and then it darted off.  After about 20 mins it returned with 2 more that were exactly like it and bounced around some more.  The objects floated in a triangle pattern.   I took video with my phone but it is not the best quality although you can see the objects flashing of colors. On July 5th the objects returned only this time they were floating over our house and this time in a straight line.  Two of them darted off after about ten mins which left one bouncing alone.  He vanished after 5 more mins.;34.645;-83.5243
