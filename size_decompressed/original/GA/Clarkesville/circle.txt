Two circular orange objects just floating in the sky, much lower than any a/c could’ve been.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-26 22:15:00;2 minutes;I saw two circular orange objects just floating in the sky, I mean much, much lower than any airplane could’ve been, especially since these circles didn’t make a noise.  After about a minute of hovering, they zoomed halfway across the sky visible to me, hovered another thirty seconds, and then just disappeared.
