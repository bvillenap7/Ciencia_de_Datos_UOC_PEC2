I decided to take some pictures of the full moon catching a tree branch and the ice accumulation that we had experienced from a storm that day, using a flash.  The camera used was a Kodak digital DX6490.  After downloading these pictures two objects appeared in the pictures that I did not notice visually. I took two pictures within seconds of each other, in the same position.  The first picture did not show these objects that appeared in the second picture.  A neighbor that was outside at the same time believes he had experienced an object in the skys.  I was looking north, northeast.  The objects in the picture, the brightest one had a short tail in an upward direction and the other looks stationary.;34.645;-83.5243
