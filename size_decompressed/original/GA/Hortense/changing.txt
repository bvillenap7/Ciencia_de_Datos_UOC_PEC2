It had bright red-green-blue-yellow lights,all seemingly to occur in some sequence. At one point a bright ball of light came from the object and descended into the woods and eventually disappeared.  I followed the object with my binoculars as it moved slowly to my left.  It moved in an up and down short pattern, yet still moving forward.  The lights changed to a red/white pulsing and the  flight pattern changed to a smooth pattern as it moved toward the north.  As the UFO moved between me and the light of the moon, I could see it from the backside and it appeared as a boom-a-rang shape.  It continued to move slowly until out of sight.;31.3188;-81.9568
