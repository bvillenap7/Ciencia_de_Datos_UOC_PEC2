Bright orange light/sphere seen over eastern horizon in Georgia.;2010-09-13 02:39:00;30 seconds;Bright orange light/sphere seen over eastern horizon in Georgia. Late one night, me (19 years old at the time), my sister (21 at the time) and her boyfriend (20 at the time), were spending the night at my parentsâ€™ house, they were out of town and I lived at home so they came to see me.  We were all sober and just hanging out and having a good time.   Around 2:30 or 2:40 in the morning we witnessed an orange light, shaped like a sphere, traveling across the sky, it stayed in one spot for about 5 seconds and then began to move, as it moved along the eastern horizon it gradually glowed brighter and brighter until it was very harsh to look at, this took around 10 seconds.  After the object grew as bright as it would go, it continued to travel along the eastern horizon and dimmed out over a span of about 5 seconds until it was gone.  The whole time it was moving, the object never moved faster than, what I could tell was, about 2mph.   After the object left we just stood there in awe and wondered to ourselves what we had just seen.   My sister has always been a skeptical person and would have never admitted to seeing a UFO until now, her boyfriend believed in UFOs but never paid too much mind to them, I always believed in UFOs and sometimes look up in the sky just to see if I can catch a glimpse of something, but never really saw anything as strange as this before.
