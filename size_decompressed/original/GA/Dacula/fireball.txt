Wife and myself on our way home at nearly dusk on may 5th 2013.  As we entered the subdivision onto flintlock dr, we noticed an orb shaped object that looked as if it were made of fire. It was brightly lit orange in color.  It traveled west to east across flintlock subdivision with a slight direction change just before it traveled out of our field of vision.  Its height im estimating less then 2000 ft, tho my wife thinks it was much lower, closer to tree level.  Im estimating the size near small helicopter size around 30 ft in diameter.  No noticeable blinking, light fluctuation, or color change.   For better mapping, roughly 1/2 mile north of hwy 316 traveling west from dacula toward athens.;33.9916;-83.8900999999999
