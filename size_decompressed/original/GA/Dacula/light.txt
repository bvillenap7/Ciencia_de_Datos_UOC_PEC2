Flashing light moving very slowing up from horizon.;2007-09-23 00:10:00;45 minutes;Flashing light moving very slowing up from horizon. Light was noticed in northeastern sky at approximately 00:15, perhaps 30 degrees above horizon.  It was flashing red and white...through binoculars, appeared diamond shaped pattern of flashing lights. Very far away.  What made this different from an airplane at night was that it did not move at a rate one would expect for a plane...only about 10 degrees upward in almost an hour.  It also appeared to wobble from time to time. While this area of sky typically is in general area of approach to Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta, the light and its extremely slow rise from the horizon prompted this report.  Typically flights stop earlier in the evening, and this light was not a usual sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
