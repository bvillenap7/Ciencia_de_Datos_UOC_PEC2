Strange Sightings;2011-06-30 13:00:00;6 minutes;Strange Sightings About 9 years ago I was sitting outside of my house and saw 3 big triangular UFO's flying in formation at what Looked to be a low speed.  They flew towards my house and then stopped abruptly and held where they were for a few seconds and then they did a slow 180 degree spin and slowly flew up and away.  They had lights on them illuminating their triangular shape.  A couple of years prior to that sighting I saw 3 balls of fire that looked to be a few feet in diameter come down from the sky and then they proceeded to hover about 5 feet off the ground for about 8 seconds and then they took off at a high speed back up at an angle towards space.  I also witnessed a Giant red glowing cloud in the night sky that was circular and visible for several minutes.  I waited awhile to report this but i clearly remember what  I saw because it was not something ordinary.;33.4715;-84.5929
