Similar siting as in Trenton, Ohio - this one in Georgia;2003-06-16 14:00:00;30 seconds;Similar siting as in Trenton, Ohio - this one in Georgia This refers to an object just as described in this report on your website:  Occurred : 10/13/2003 21:30  (Entered as : 10/13/2003 21:30)  Reported: 10/14/2003 12:43:11 AM 00:43  Posted: 10/15/2003  Location: Trenton, OH Shape:  Other Duration:  2.5 to 3 minutes  Strange Passenger Jets  I first thought it was a passenger jet, but it was extremely low over my house.  I, too, heard very little noise, nothing loud enough to be a jet engine.  I even checked out some air force sites, and told myself it must have been one of their low-flying bombers like the B1B Bomber.  We have several air bases in a 100 mile radius.  It was broad daylight on a sunny day around 2pm.  When I read the account of the sighting featured on your website, I realized that I saw the same object as this person in Trenton.  It flew very slowly and I remember the shape was similar to your graphic on the site, maybe a little longer. Thought I post this - maybe the person who posted the other siting will see it.;30.9134409090909;-84.5776863636364
