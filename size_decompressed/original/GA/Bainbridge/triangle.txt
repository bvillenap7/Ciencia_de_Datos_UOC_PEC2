Something caught my eye and I looked up and I saw a craft moving no more than 10 miles per hour.  It was a perfect triangle, deep purple in color, about 40' long and 20' wide.  It made no noise whatsoever.  It was traveling west.  Then all the sudden 3 minutes later it shot up straight into the air at an incredible speed and vanished thru the clouds.
