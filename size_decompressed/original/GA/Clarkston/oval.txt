I was in 3rd or 4th grade, and I know it was the end of summer, and along with other facts, this had to be in 73 or 74.  I was walking home alone to my apartment building around 9 pm going around the side of the building where I would enter the rear.  Our apartment building was next to a large area which had been graded for a new apartment complex, but there were some woods seperating our building from this.   I became aware of something behind me.  I don't know if I heard anything, or saw anything to make me turn around.  An oval object about 20 feet in diameter was hovering above the trees near me.  It seemed to be bathed in an orange light.  I couldn't make out any details on the surface of it, except an orange light, and there seemed to be brighter lights within it which could have been portals.  The object moved away from me deeper into the woods/new apartments site.  I walked along a path i knew trying to pursue it till I reached a clearing, when I noticed other people around me.  I can only remember my brother as one of them, and the others were neighbors who were looking at the same thing I was.  I spotted it far off on the other side of the construction site.  It seemed to be doing some kind of manuevers, slowly rotating, or changing colors or something, hard to remember.  It then just went down, and I didn't see it again.
