Mother ship and small craft  above Atlanta Ga.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));2007-12-10 18:30:00;1 hour 10 mins;Mother ship and small craft  above Atlanta Ga Bright object in sky,at first looked like a comet.  Watching close with binoculars could see it was not a comet but nothing I have ever seen before. This object was white in color and looked like a cigar.was moving slowly across sky towards the north but was moving up and down and side to side all this time.  Another small object could be seen as well with a white light that would flash ever now and then. The weather was mild with clear skies, and Monroe GA is about 30 miles north east of Atlanta Ga. We have all seen the planes coming and going from the Atl airport and these were no planes or helicopters. I'm a 46 year old over the road truck driver and have drove at night for years and never seen nothing close too this. Other witnesses include my wife, 45 son, 23 and his wife, 23.

It’s super bright and really fast;2019-07-14 22:26:00;3 minutes;It’s super bright and really fast I was leaving my aunt’s house across town going home.  I took my normal  route.  I was turning on the road before my neighborhood and I saw a bright light and the cars in front of me hit the break lights.  I slowed down and saw something REALLY  bright. It was too bright for headlights or helicopter or planes.  I stopped tried to record it but my phone died instantly and my screen in my car went out at the same time because my music stopped.  It wasn’t making any noise at all.  My car didn’t die but everything just got weird. It was super bright and was hurting my eyes.  I just was scared because it was just super bright, lighting up only my car and nothing around it. It moved towards town and then started turning up straight like a rocket but the light was still shining bright. I started to drive slowly towards home and then the real odd stuff happen it shot directly upward fast as hell! I wanted to tell my wife but I knew she would make fun of me.  I’m not sure if! it had anything to do with it but my dog was standing starring really hard at my car which is definitely not him at all.  Please tell me I’m not crazy.;33.8186321428571;-83.708339285714
