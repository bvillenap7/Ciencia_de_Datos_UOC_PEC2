flashing blue/green light over Monroe, GA.;2009-11-11 01:20:00;6 hours;flashing blue/green light over Monroe, GA. My brother called me outside to look at something in the sky.  We decided it wasn't a star when it started pulsing and flashing blue and green.  It was fairly far away but it was a perfectly clear night.  It moved fast in a zig zag pattern and then moved up fast, and stayed there for a while, not moving.  This morning we got up again to look before the sun came up and it was in a different place again, but it was still there.;33.8186321428571;-83.708339285714
