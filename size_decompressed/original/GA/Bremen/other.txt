At 5:00 am I went to take the dog out. The sky was very clear and the stars were visible.  I immediately noticed an extremely bright white light in the sky hovering to the southeast. It was much larger than anything else in the sky. At first I thought it was the Northstar, but it seemed way too large.  Then it started slowly moving. It went up and then to the right.  Then it started slowly moving to the left.  It was moving so slowly that it seemed to be hovering.  It had extremely bright light beams coming out from it in all direcetions.  The beams were very distinct and very long, especially the three that were on top.  All of the light was white, but every few minutes the top beams would begin to glow a greenish color and red lights would appear on the right side.  The center of the object from which the light beams were eminating had a arch shape.  I called my mother on the telephone and had her go look at it (she lives about 3 miles from my home).  She ! could see the same thing.  We watched this object hover for approximately 2.5 hours.  During this time it was moving very slowly to the left and rising.  After the sun came up and all of the stars had vanished, it was still there and just as bright.  We watched it until it rose up and disappeared into the horizon (similar to how the space shuttle does went it is launched). It was by far the strangest and most unexplainable thing I have ever seen.  It was very obvious that it was nothing like anything I have ever witnessed in the sky.  I am absolutely positive that it was a UFO... I am now a believer!;33.7311;-85.131
