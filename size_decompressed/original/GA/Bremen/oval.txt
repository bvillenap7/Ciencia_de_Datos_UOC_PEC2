PD));2015-05-08 22:00:00;4 hours;Seeing lighted objects hover in the Southeastern skies for long periods of time. At approximately 10:00pm on May 06, 07,and 8thâ€¦ We have been seeing UFO type objects in the skies of the southeast.  These objects hover in one place for long periods of time with blinking lights that seem to be circling each object.  When we saw an airplane passing one of the objects, two of us saw the airplane light up as if the light from the object had reflected onto the airplane.  The lights that seem to be circling each object are greenish-blue, red, yellow and white. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been observing stars, but we cannot be certain.
