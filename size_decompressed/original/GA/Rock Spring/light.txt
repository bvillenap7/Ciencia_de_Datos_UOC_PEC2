Fast flying glowing light.;2010-10-01 23:00:00;5 minutes;Fast flying glowing light. I live in a very rural area and I was outside in the front yard with my two dogs.  The porch light was off, but the Moon was very bright.  I looked right up above me and noticed a bright, somewhat green, light moving across the sky. It was moving way too fast to be a plane and didn’t have the flashing light that planes have. I continued to watch it move across till it just disappeared in the middle of the sky.  It wasn’t a shooting star, I’ve seen plenty of those, but I have never seen anything like that before. It was very eerie.;34.8049;-85.246
