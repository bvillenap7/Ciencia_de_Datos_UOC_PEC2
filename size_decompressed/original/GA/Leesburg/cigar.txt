Fast moving object seen in Leesburg Ga that does not resemble anything known.;2008-11-23 01:32:00;5 seconds;Fast moving object seen in Leesburg Ga that does not resemble anything known. A bar approximately the width of my pinky finger appeared between the constellation of Orion and Taurus.  It appeared to be self laminated and moving rapidly towards Andromeda before fading out of sight.  It had no blinking lights as an airplane would.  In my opinion the speed of the object coupled with the fact that its shape never changed and the time in which it appeared rules out birds or animals capable of flight.   I have been a keen watcher of the sky for many years and have NEVER seen anything like this in my entire life!   The object was only in view for approximately 5 seconds.;31.6812;-84.1593
