U.F.O. spotted ouside Leesburg, Georgia hoving over trees before  rapidly diving dove and up again.;1998-03-01 03:00:00;45  minutes;U.F.O. spotted ouside Leesburg, Georgia hoving over trees before  rapidly diving dove and up again. Two friends and I were heading North/Northeast on New York RD about 10 miles outside of Leesburg, Georgia when I spotted something out of the back side window. All I saw were lights and I thought it was just an airplane, but I watched it anyway because no one was talking. I lost it behind the trees about 5 minutes later. We reached the end of New York Rd. and got out to sit and talk. We saw the aircraft again and it was hovering above the trees not far from us, and it was not making any sound. It would hover in one place and dive straight down and back up again very fast. Then it would move over a bit and do the same thing. It was very quick with its movements. I've never witnessed an aircraft moving in such a way as this one did. We soon lost it in the trees so we decided to drive in the direction it was heading, about 15 minutes later while heading south on Lesley Highway back towards Leesburg we spotted it again to the West of us near a radio tower. We followed it until it started to accelerate, at this point we observed a series of lights blink on and off. Three lights blinked on one side(?) and then 3 on the other. I do believe the lights changed too, from red to orange to white(not necessarily in that order). After this it quickly accelerated and disappeared. We didn't see it anymore after that. The 3 of us had not been drinking or using any kind of drug when we witnessed this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));31.6812;-84.1593
