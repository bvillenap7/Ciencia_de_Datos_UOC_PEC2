Object seen moving with storm on radar.;2013-03-10 22:35:00;10 minutes;object seen moving with storm on radar Using the weather.com app my Husband noticed a very large doughnut shaped white object covering a massive area within the storm over Macon GA.  I immediately picked up my tablet and using the same weather app found the same doughnut like object hovering over Jacksonville FL.  It was the same shape and size and made it from Macon to Jacksonville within 10 minutes.  Within the frames of radar images it looked as if it were sending out waves or a pulse.;31.6812;-84.1593
