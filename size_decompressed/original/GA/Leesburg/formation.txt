5 to 6 round lights converging into one object that disappeared and then reappeared as one shortly thereafter only to disappear again;2006-07-13 22:45:00;1 to 2 minutes;5 to 6 round lights converging into one object that disappeared and then reappeared as one shortly thereafter only to disappear again A friend and I witnessed about 5 to 6 bright orange lights above a tree line. The lights just seemed to appear out of nowhere. They flashed from orange to yellow to white, almost like the afterburner of a jet. We could then faintly see the outline of the object, which appeared to be either cigar-like or saucer-like. Upon lighting up after a few seconds, they then converged symmetrically into one object, which seemed to fade away in the distance. Approximately 10 to 15 seconds later, the object reappeared in the same exact spot, but only as one bright orange/yellow/white light. Then it just faded away again.
