Triangle shaped lights over KIA motors manufacturing Georgia;2012-11-13 21:30:00;2 minutes;triangle shaped lights over KIA motors manufacturing Georgia At 9:30 pm I was walking towards the building I work at, KIA motors manufacturing Georgia.  Above the building and off in the distance I saw a large object flying overhead.  All I could make out was seven lights forming a triangle.   The object was moving a little slower than the airplanes that I am accustomed to seeing.  The object moved in complete silence.  I followed the object through the sky until the parking lot lights made it impossible to see the object anymore.  The whole encounter lasted about one minute    After arriving in the building and discussing this with other employees I learned I was not the only one who saw something strange.  A co worker of mine said he saw what looked like two shooting stars chasing each other.   Another said he could here jets flying overhead but saw nothing.;32.8346;-85.1178
