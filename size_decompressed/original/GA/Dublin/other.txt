Loud sonic boom noises which shake building structures.;2008-03-10 11:04:00;1sec;Loud sonic boom noises which shake building structures. Mysterious loud sounds like sonic booms are heard three times a day everyday and it shakes the entire building structure. It is so strange because this day there was a sound with the appearance like the sonic boom which is heard by the entire community and it shakes the entire building structure. The first boom occurred at 10:00 and the next at 11:04 and sometimes there is a third or fourth sound. It is scary because the entire building structure feels as though it is moving. I find this to be a little abnormal from the basic sonic boom. This is one of many strange events happening in this town.
