While I was outside smoking a cigarette, I looked up to see a very bright, silent, hovering craft.  The object was primarily yellow with two red circling lights.  After shining a laser pointer and spotlight at the craft, it disappeared as mysteriously as it had appeared.;32.4583342857142;-82.9365382857149
Yellow Glowing Lights on I-16 Georgia.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-12 23:00:00;5 minutes;Yellow Glowing Lights on I-16 Georgia. Traveling from Macon towards Savannah on I-16 Approximately 45 minutes past Exit 54, Time is 11pm at night, for those few minutes I was the only one on that particular section of highway.  I notice three dull yellow lights in my rear view mirror , about two miles behind me.  One of the lights then closes on my car extremely fast.  The light is not a perfect circle , but a circle none the less.  Itâ€™s a dull glowing yellow.  It gets to within 10 yards from my bumper , then just starts to slow down.  Once it drop back to 50 yards behind me , it just disappears -gone -nothing .  I was watching my rear view as it just vanished .  The other lights never advanced.  I slowed down, but I never saw the light come back - it was just gone.  There was no exits, no where for it to have gone - but it did .  It made no sound .  There were no signs of brake lights or turn signals that a motorcycle would have had at that time of night.
