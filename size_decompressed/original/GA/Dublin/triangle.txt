While driving home from out-of-town, I watched a dot in the sky move in all directions at great speeds. Faster than any jet. I would stop, move, disappear, and reappear. This went on for 15 minutes. I turned off the hwy. to my sister's house. While parking, a hoovering sound startled me. A triangular craft moved slowly over my car. It was gray/silver with three large white circles in a triangular pattern on the underside. The circles looked like lights that were not on. The lights took up most of the underside. It was sleek and aerodynamic looking. It dissappeared and the only sign of what direction it took were the bent trees 100 yards away. Two children playing next door upstairs saw the craft also. As it left the house trembled. We live near Warner Robins AFB. This base has managed to stay around although hundreds of simular bases have closed!;32.4583342857142;-82.9365382857149
