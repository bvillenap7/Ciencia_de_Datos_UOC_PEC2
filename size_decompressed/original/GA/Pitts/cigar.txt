I went outside to look at the stars, the moon and stars were brivht so I decided to take a picture of the moon. I have the new LG G3 phone, it has 534 megipixcils p.s.i,  The most of any phone, and it proved it!  I was looking At the screen as I took the pix, and I instantly saw the craft on the screen when the camera on my phone took the pix. What the hell was that I said to myself, I looked at the picture and there was a small  check looking mark just above and to the left of the moon. I enlarged the picture and there was a Cigar shaped craft.  I instantly started taking more pictures of the moon and the sky around it. I saw in my screen a couple more objects.  I just keep taking pixs.  I end up with a couple more pixs of cigar looking craft and what I think is a gold looking saucer!   I HAVE the pictures to prove it, and will be glad to show it to and investigater.  I will not give the picture to anyone!  Ive been waiting, and trying very hard to catch them on camera, But everytime I see one its gone befofe I can get  a picture. its the most exciting  thing in the wrold. You can tell people and they act like they dont belive it or just dont care!  I do not understand it!;31.9385;-83.5575
