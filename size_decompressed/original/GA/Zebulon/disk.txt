Series of lights moving in a straight line across the sky.;2014-07-16 22:00:00;10 minutes;Series of lights moving in a straight line across the sky. There were 6 equally spaced lights flashing in sequence in the southern sky.   At a glance they appeared to be stars until further examination showed them to be flashing in sequence and in a straight line.   They covered an area (depending on their distance away) of 2 miles to 50 mi.   We heard no sound and then they moved slowly from east to west.    We observed this for about ten minutes. I questioned others who live south of us and no one had heard any helicopters or anything else around this time.;33.0999;-84.3094
