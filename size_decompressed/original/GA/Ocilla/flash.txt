I was looking at the stars during the night smoking a cigarette.  I was looking around because i already seen two falling stars that night.  While i was looking at the stars i saw a light that looked like a star, but it wasn't a plane or an helicopter because the light was not blinking.  The aircraft or whatever it was flew across the sky moving kinda slowly but up and down and in a zig-zag pattern.  I watched it go fly across the sky for a while(maybe 15-30mins) and finally it kinda stopped in a stationary position for the rest of the time until the sun came up.  but it was moving like up and down and side to side the whole time i was watching.  At times the white light would have red lights going around it, and blue lights at times.  Also, i seen a big flash of light come out from under the object for a second or so.  I thought i was just seeing things... but i know i seen something... it wasn't a star, a plane, or a helicopter or something.   I believe i definitely saw a ufo.  I wish i would've had a camera or a video camera to capture it but i didn't.  I'm pretty sure i seen a ufo. ((NUFORC Note:  Report from first witness.  PD));31.6005;-83.26
