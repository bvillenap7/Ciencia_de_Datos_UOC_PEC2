This is what i can rememer of my account,this is when comet hail-bop was visible to earth by the eye,i wish i wrote down the date,but i didnt think that was the important part,the important part is a saw a ufo that night,it was toward the end of the veiwing cycle,i think it was 6days or more.I was facing i would say north west at about 8:00pm est. and comet hail bop is moving right to left(not visible ofcourse)and from behind and below the comet came a ball of light with its own tail in what was a half circle then dissepered.The oblect of light was about 1/10 the size of the comet,and im guessing even smaller because of shinning light factor,it might have appeared bigger. I dont know how ive held all this in,im glad i did a search about comet hail bop's ufo and stumbled upon this site where i could releive myself in away.I know there was alot of hype around that time because of heavens gate,I really beleived it was true when i saw the ufo that night,it was either the day after the suicide or that night,i felt so good that i saw it,i know it sounds weird,but i did,im among the few,but many now,i hope someone else experienced the same thing.I know i could have searched for the dates of the suicide to make it look more accurate,but i know the truth,and i dont need to prove to someone else,but i wanted to share this in the way i see it every day,not accurate but real,and the way i remember it.I really want to share this,and see if other people have come out to share what they saw that night,i cant be the only one that was looking up at that moment. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Hale-Bopp was visible from the northern hemisphere in late March 1997.  PD));33.465809009009;-84.1035171171168

My friend saw the ufo over my head and didnt think much of it. It first appeared like a airplane, a slow moving light, almost a cylinder shape. i saw the light it was very bright and very white. It was moving slow, the speed of a aircraft. Although the ufo wasnt very high off the ground, possibly a mile to 2miles high max. The slow moving light got brighter and shaped more like a cylinder and sped away at a extremely fast speed. The ufo was only in my sight for about 3seconds. The light was bright enough and big enough to know it wasnt a plane, and it wasnt a shooting star because the object was moving slow, then sped away at a very fast pace. It was a awesome sighting, my first sighting i could say without a doubt it was a ufo, very cool. key points about the ufo, it made no sounds. The ufo was very low, and it was very bright. The bright light was white in color, and the ufo changed it shape into a more cylinder shape when it started to speed away.;33.465809009009;-84.1035171171168
