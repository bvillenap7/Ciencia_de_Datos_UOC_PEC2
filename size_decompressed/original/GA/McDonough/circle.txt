My husband and I were driving at approximately 10:15 p.m. when looking toward the moon in the southwestern sky, I saw a circular orb of dense light falling relatively slowly straight toward the ground.  The light was a light greenish white.  Possibly a white center with a thin ring of green on the outer edge.  There was no tail or trail.  There was no smoke.  No crackle.  Did not appear to be any sort of debris.  It was fairly close, I'd say within a 1/4 mile from where I was traveling in the car.  Or it was extremely large. I lost sight of it when it passed below the tree tops.;33.465809009009;-84.1035171171168
