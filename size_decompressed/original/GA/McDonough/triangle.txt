I had a flashlight and set it down on the heatpump so i could see inside. after a min or two I noticed the light was very bright. I picked the flashlight up and it was off! I looked up, i dont know why,and saw a v shaped object about 500ft above tree line with very bright lights. It was moveing very slow and with out no sound what so ever! I  watched it slowly move out of sight! I walked back in the house telling myself it was a airplane, but airplanes make noise and have to move about 200mph to fly! ones as big as i saw anyway. I hope someone else saw it to so i want thank im crazy! It was V shaped with a bright light in front it made no sound because i tryed to hear something as it passed,i heard nothing! I would say about 50 yards across the widest part and about 100yards long!;33.465809009009;-84.1035171171168
