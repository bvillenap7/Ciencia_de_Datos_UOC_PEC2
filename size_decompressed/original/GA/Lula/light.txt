Bright Round Light floating through Trees in Lula Georgia.;2014-11-06 19:55:00;2 minutes;Bright Round Light floating through Trees in Lula Georgia. Under a very bright moon, on a cold clear windy night in Northeast Georgia, I saw a perfectly round Orb of extreme brightness and very well defined edges float East to west at barely tree top level.   It disappeared into trees before I could get around to a prime viewing spot.   For a second I thought a spotlight was coming from the top of the hill, which is where my home is, but instantly realized it was something strange.
