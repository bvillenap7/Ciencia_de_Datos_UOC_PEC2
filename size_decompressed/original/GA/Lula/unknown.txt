Flashing object with tail directly above NE Georgia.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));2007-12-10 19:00:00;15 minutes;Flashing object with tail directly above NE Georgia My brother originally witnessed the object from Commerce, GA and called me to take a look at it.  I was in Lula, GA at the time.  I observed it with a pair of Nikon 7X35 binoculars.  I originally thought it was that comet that was visible a few weeks ago and passed it off as that, but my brother then told me over the phone that there was a light intermittently flashing with no apparent frequency or pattern.  After 10-15 minutes of watching I concluded that it was definitely not an airplane or satellite.  The object didn't appear to be moving in a straight direction and looked to me as if it was actually moving away from Earth.  I did see the flashing light (white) and the 'tail' was shaped similar to a comma.  As you can tell by my lack of reference points in regards to constellations or stars, I'm not an astronomer, however I am certain the object had to be some sort of rocket or a freak natural phenomena (but that doesn't explain the flashing light).  Pretty exciting really!  My brother watched it for about 30-45 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));34.384;-83.6576
