I saw One green light, and one regular incandescent light.  It did not move in the form of a plane or a helicopter. It was twirling and tumbling on it's axis.

Triangular UFO following a red light.;2013-08-09 23:00:00;15 minutes;Triangular UFO following a red light. Clear night with some clouds.   While walking the dog a triangular UFO passed over with another red light in front of it, about 100 feet in front.   The UFO had 4 small light in the front, with one white light on the other tips.   This passed low and made two circle passes.  The second pass the UFO was much higher in the sky.  The sound was low, unlike any air craft we had heard before.   On the first pass, the UFO emitted two white objects into the sky.  The objects stayed in the sky for several minutes. ((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT)) This is a correction of date from an earlier report.  The triangular ufo had white lights on the two ends and four to three red lights on the front corner. It was following a red light.  It released two white lights in the sky.  This ufo passed by twice while going in a circular flight. ((END ADDENDUM));32.6339;-83.6696
