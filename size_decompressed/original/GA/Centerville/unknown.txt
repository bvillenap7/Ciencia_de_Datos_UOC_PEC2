A strange, multiple-light, craft trying to blend in with cell towers.;2018-02-28 07:38:00;~10 seconds;A strange, multiple-light, craft trying to blend in with cell towers. We were driving by the Centervile city hall and passed two lights next to each other.  We assumed it was a cell tower but it started to have more lights and some even on the bottom.   The bottom lights lit up the underside of the craft and it started to float away.   We drove past the area in the morning, and a cell tower was not there, proving it was not a tower.   It was an oval shape, and was gone when we looked back.  It hovered for a moment though, but was to big to be a helicopter. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It was an evening PM sighting. Sorry about that.
