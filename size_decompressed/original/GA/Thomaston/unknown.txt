Strange lights over Thomaston, Georgia.;2014-10-12 22:15:00;45 minutes;Strange lights over Thomaston Georgia Have been seeing objects hovering in the night sky for about 2 months now with red green and white lights.  Know these are not aircraft, as we live 1/4 mile from local municipal airport and see aircraft flying over all the time at night.  This night I noticed 4 of these objects to the south and two over the airport which is to the north.  Had seen 7 one night coming up from Reynolds 3 nights ago.   Went to get into the truck to try and get a closer look at them with binocular's.  Before we got into the truck and were on the front porch, suddenly there appears over the airport a yellowish orange light hovering just above the airport.  This light moved slowly upwards and to the east, just barely and then just as quickly as it appeared, it shot upward and was out of sight in 3 seconds.  Got into the truck and noticed all six of the other objects had disappeared from site.   Suddenly there were 6 objects all near each other in the south eastern sky and were there for abou! t 2 minutes.  I turned for 10 seconds to tell my wife and point to her where they were now, and when I turned around they were gone.  What seems strange is that after the yellowish orange light appeared and disappeared, the other lights disappeared too, and then appeared only briefly and then were gone.;32.9031000000001;-84.3313999999994
