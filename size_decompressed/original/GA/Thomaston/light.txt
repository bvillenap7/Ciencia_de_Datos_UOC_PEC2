I first walked to my car to grab my cigarettes.  The reason I bring this up is because there seemed to be some electrical malfunction of some sort..  my car “dinger” (for when the door is open) was going off, but not in its usual routine.  It would ding very quickly and then pause randomly, pick back up and slow down, like the electricity was running out.  I then decided if my car was having issues, I didn’t want to deal with it yet.  And went back to the porch.  Then as I began to light my cigarette my eyes trailed from the night sky to this huge bright light, with an almost blueish tint.  It was huge, it was almost as large as the moon at their different distances,  the light appearing to be very close..  It floated very smoothly yet rapidly, making a mirrored J and disappearing into the trees.;32.9031000000001;-84.3313999999994
