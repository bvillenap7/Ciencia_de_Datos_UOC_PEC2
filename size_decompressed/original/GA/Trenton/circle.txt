Small UFO with lights and great speed;1983-04-01 18:00:00;1 minute;Small UFO with lights and great speed I was 6 or 7 years old and remember it like it was yesterday!  I was sitting on a picnic table in the front yard of my grandmother’s home with my cousins.  All of a sudden, out from behind a small building to my right came a small round flying object with extreme speed.  Everyone took off running to the porch screaming except for me. I was fascinated. The object came to a complete stop over my head I probably could have reached out and touched it.  As I sat there staring up at its mesmerizing beauty, it was like time stood still.  Although I could hear my cousins screaming from the porch for me to run, I was frozen in place just staring at an object that gave me such peace. The object was not large at all: maybe 4’ in diameter Perfectly round several small clear lights around the bottoms edge 4 large red round lights in the center of the bottom forming a square the object itself was gunmetal in color.  The object hovered over my head for about 30 to 60 ! seconds and left with a speed I had never seen before (not even to this day). Upon the objects departure, I could see there was a second layer on the top like half of a small ball. Although the experience was short, it is something I will never forget and have recalled often!  This event took place on Sand Mountain, Trenton, Georgia, USA!;34.9017;-85.5171
