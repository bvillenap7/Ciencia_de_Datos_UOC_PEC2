I saw/see a white light in the slightly NE direction, blinking with a green and a red light blinking. The lights are very high. The light does not move in a smooth flight but surge and drift. 2 other lights (with a red and a green/blue blinking light) smaller than the first separate from the first light. One goes directly west, the other SW.  At this time the first light is gaining altitude and is moving west.;34.9536;-83.3893
