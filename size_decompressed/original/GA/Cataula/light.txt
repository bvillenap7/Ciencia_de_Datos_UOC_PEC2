I was sitting outside in a lawn chair at approximately 9:00 p.m. eastern time facing what I believe to be east.  I was looking at the night sky, nothing out of the ordinary from any other night at this point. While focused in one direction I noticed what appeared to be movement of two regular looking stars…..    The position from my vantage point was directly in front of me slightly to the right at about a 45 degree angle from the ground. As a point of reference I noticed a star at what I describe at top position and another star at a bottom position in a vertical orientation in reference to the ground.  The distance apart is not known but would be from about 20 degrees at the bottom to 45 degrees at the top star looking up from my chair.  On either side of an imaginary line between the top and bottom stars were two other ordinary looking stars on the left and one on the right slightly lower than horizontal.  I am unable to estimate distance but were all within my field of view. What Happened…..     The two stars on either side of the above mentioned top and bottom stars as a point of reference started to rotate as if rotating around a common axis.  They moved at the same rate of speed as each other.  The two stars both rotated simultaneously 180 degrees and changed position.  The one on the left moved to the position as the one on the right visa-versa.  When they reached the 180 degree position change they both stopped and then started moving in opposite directions from each other until out of sight.  They appeared to move off in equal but opposite angles one slightly up and the other slightly down.  The speed of this movement was not fast but steady and the entire sighting lasted about 45 seconds at best.;32.6221;-84.9217
