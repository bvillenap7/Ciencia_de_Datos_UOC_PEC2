Array of bright lights seen over Blythe GA Sky;2015-04-21 21:00:00;10 seconds;Array of bright lights seen over Blythe GA Sky I was driving south towards Blythe, Ga, on IH 1.  A sudden bright light appeared slowly and at first it seemed like a huge shooting star but it ceased to increase in size.  About 2-3 seconds after, one other light appeared to the left of the initial light, of the same intensity as the first, followed by the last light, again, to the left of the others creating an array of three lights.  The tint of the lights was of a white-blue bright.  Right after they appear, they disappeared leaving a glittery effect/trail.  I was in plain shock.  Other details, weather conditions: very clear and visiability was high.;33.2943;-82.195
