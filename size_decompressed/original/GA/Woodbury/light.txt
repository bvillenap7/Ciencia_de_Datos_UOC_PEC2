String of tiny lights in sky approx. 50 to 75 in single file straight line extremely high up.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-29 21:30:00;10 minutes;String of tiny lights in sky approx. 50 to 75 in single file straight line extremely high up. I saw a string of tiny lights traveling at a southeast heading from the northwest in a perfectly strait line, (single file).  Very high possibly 10 to 20 thousand feet.  One object would reverse course without stopping, or turning and continue moving in that direction, then reversing again.  I watched until the end of the line had passed, then two brought up the rear.  Could not have been conventional aircraft.  No running lights, no sound, in close proximity. Jet aircraft couldn't travel in single file that close together.  I did report to the local police dept.  I don't think they believed me.  Not saying that I saw UFO's.  Don't know what it was.  I am 71 years old and in good mental health.  I don't take drugs or drink.  I saw what I saw.;32.9853;-84.5991
