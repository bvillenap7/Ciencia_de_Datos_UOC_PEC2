Really big triangle with 3 large lights following behind a dark delta wing craft with red lights across rear;2007-09-30 22:00:00;30sec-1min;Really big triangle with 3 large lights following behind a dark delta wing craft with red lights across rear I have been observing this thing since August, recorded a video in early September but have waited to see it closer and or get a better picture. I have not made a digital copy I can upload of the object with the low southern star as a reference, hope to get a better shot. On Sunday September 30 2008 I was watching TV when a loud rumble like a jet at full throttle came over my house. I ran out to the field before looking back and up. I could not believe it it was a giant triangular craft with large globes of amber on the points, ahead of it appeared to be a giant stealth delta wing craft and across the rear was 4 sets of red lights like an old Thunderbird. The triangle with the lights was following so close it was as if it were towing the triangle which was very close. They flew over and I could see them shrink before disappearing over the horizon, leading me to believe it was actually much larger and flying much higher than they looked as it flew over. I figured it was bigger than a football field if that was 500 feet. After seeing it so long makes me think it was much higher which means it was really big! Although I am 50 mi. east of  Dublin the flight path I have been observing heads straight to Dublin. They seem to like swamps. As many times I have a camera with me that night I did not and that picture would have been great and barely fit the screen. It was not until the Dublin incident that I felt like coming forward.;32.5512;-81.9107
I want to talk to the East Dublin couple to compare notes;2007-09-30 22:00:00;30sec-1min;I want to talk to the East Dublin couple to compare notes As I reported earlier I have watched it for months, not until it flew over did I decide to come forward. I do not have video of it coming over me but would have been a show stopper. I feel strongly the thing in this video is what went over my house. I just posted the video on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqTWDx8nNlU YouTube - Portal Georgia UFO;32.5512;-81.9107
