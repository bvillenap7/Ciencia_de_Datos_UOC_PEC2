From about 9:30pm to 10:05pm (EDT United States), we saw was looked like 3 orange-red lights flashing consecutively in a horizontal line . As the first light dimmed, the second would appear,then third, sequentially from the right side to left side very quickly.  The speed of the sequence and steady right-center-left... pattern gave us the impression that the lights were rapidly orbitting around an unseen center in the night sky.  The first appearance was toward the western sky and the brightest,possibly closest, that we witnessed. It popped up with its racing serial pattern, showed it off for 10 or 15 seconds, then it disappeared just as quickly.   We scanned the sky for a bit and caught the performance 3 more times for about 10 seconds (each time), as if advertising its path across the Northern sky, heading further away heading towards Northeast, in the direction of the upper Savannah River or South Carolina.  We believe it was one object that reappeared, not multiples.  There was no noise coming from the light show.  A few actual planes passed through while we waited for the lights to reappear, and we heard their engines fine.;32.5512;-81.9107
