I was returning from a wedding in Statesboro, Georgia travelling Interstate 16 east toward Macon, Georgia. I had just passed the intersection of U.S.Hwy 1 & I-16 and was perhaps a couple of miles West of the intersection.  There were no cars visible other than I could see tail lights in distance.  A bright blue light caught my eye in my rear view mirror, very similar in color to emergency lights used on State Patrol cars.  The lights moved quickly from side to side in my rear view.  I lost sight of them after they had made several passes from side to side and checked my side view mirrors and caught sight of two circular shaped blue lights traveling at an angle together to the left and behind my car.   The lights maintained their position for perhaps twenty seconds, I turned my stereo off and rolled my window down. When I did, the lights pulled even with my window no further from me than the width of the Interstate median.  There was no sound.   They stayed even with ! my car for another twenty or thirty seconds before accelerating away from me, angling to the left and increasing their altitude and, suddenly sped away in an arc, to my left and over some trees and disappeared.  I do not drink, I do not use drugs, I do not smoke. I am a 59 year old grandfather who would love to know what happened.
