Then, I futherr noticed it was moving in a westward direction and irregualr movements.   As i looked, I saw a shape descend seemingly out of the first shape.  It was a brilliant orange (like an ember blowing out of a fire.  It descended down about two thousand feet, then turned left in an 180 turn, rising back to the altitude of the first shape.  It further sped off at a really high rate of speed to the southeast.  The main shape continued to due west without changing altitude.
