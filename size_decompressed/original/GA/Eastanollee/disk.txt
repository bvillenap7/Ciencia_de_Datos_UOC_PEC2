Then suddenly a large bright white light passed overhead at about 1000 feet. the craft was heading north and out of sight in seconds.                                                    With the distance it traveled in seconds, i estimated that it was traveling at around 1350 mph + .  There was no engine sound or sonic boom.  minutes later i saw the blinking lights of a jet at altitude and i could barely hear its engines and the unknown craft was much closer !;34.5006;-83.259
