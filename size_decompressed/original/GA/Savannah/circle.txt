Hazy moon like object with attachments.;1971-02-15 19:00:00;20 minutes;Hazy moon like object with attachments. My friend and I were walking along Abercorn Extension (a busy street) in Savannah in 1971, we looked up and saw in the sky what looked like a hazy moon, but then a hazy line went diagonally down from the circle and another smaller hazy circle formed.  We were afraid and went inside and called the Hunter Army Air Force Base nearby, and they told us it was a weather balloon in Florida.  I don't remember reading about it in the paper later.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221

Seven white round objects in the sky.;2007-11-12 09:20:00;one half hour;Seven white round objects in the sky. We all work for a pest control company.  We had just checked out a termite infestation at a commercial building that our company had under warranty.   After that we were standing out in the parking lot talking when I happened to look up into the sky.  I was looking toward Hunter Army Air Force Base.  In the sky I saw a round bright white object.   At first I thought it was a helium filled balloon from the car dealerships on Abercorn road not far from where we were.   As I continued to watch another object appeared, then another, then another.  I said to my coworkers What is that?   They looked up and saw the objects also.  There were four objects that were roughly in the same line.   As we looked one of my coworkers said Look to the right of them there are some more.  I looked to the right and saw three more in the shape of a triangle.   As we all looked they suddenly all changed into a V formation.   Then, as quickly, they changed back into four in one line and three into the triangle formation.   Most of the objects were very bright but a couple were somewhat dim but visible.  I don't think these were helium balloons as they were staying pretty much in the same position in the sky.   A lady came out of one of the businesses close to us and asked what we were looking at.  One of my coworkers jokingly said UFOS.   She looked up and said Oh yeah, I see them.   We watched them for sevearl minutes more and then I had to leave as I had an appointment with one of our customers.   So we all left, not knowing what we had seen.   By the way the sky was perfectly blue and clear that day.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221

Red lights over Savannah Ga.;2012-11-25 18:00:00;20 minutes;Red lights over Savannah Ga Mother and daughter passing by Hunter Army Airfeild on the way home.  Pulled over because they witnessed several orange/red lights in the sky.  The best way to describe them would be comet like.  Bright red/white light at the front of the object obviously circular which trailed off into what can only be described as a long tail of pink/red/orange light.   Several objects which crisscrossed each other going in all directions but with obvious intent.  They would turn suddenly or stop in midair and circle around.  Could not have been firworks or planes that we are used to seeing in this area.   Its very close to the runway at Hunter and any planes or aircraft in this area fly very low as they are either taking off or landing.  Some aircraft are scary low in this area to where you can read the letterings on the planes.   These objects where very high and crossed each others path dangerously.  Another witness was about 2 miles away and witnessed the same lights abou! t a half hour later.   A coworker also witnessed the same lights later that night about ten miles north of this area.  Same description but only one witnessed.  Perhaps a coincidence but we have also heard the strange earth groaning sounds in almost the exact area for several hours on October 10th 2012.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
