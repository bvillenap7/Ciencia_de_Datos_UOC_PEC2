Blue-green fireball;1999-09-03 01:30:00;5 seconds;Blue-green fireball Traveling north out of Savannah, I'm not sure what road it was, we were heading home after spending the day in the old section of town. My 23 year old daughter and I. I'm a machinist, and she is a veterinary assistant. Anyway, we had stopped to get gas, and had pulled out of the station, looking for road signs to get on the interstate, when we saw a huge streak of light traveling from (at best guess)NW to SE. It actually caught our attention because of it's color, it was a beautiful greenish blue, and like I said, BIG. It was moving very fast, it didn't seem at the time to be very high up in the sky. In fact we slowed down and looked over to see if it had crashed in the wooded area to our right. A few months later I was talking to a co-worker and I mentioned it to him, and oddly enough, he had been out in his boat on Lake Greenwood at the time, and he had seen it too. Lake Greenwood is 160 or so miles from Savannah, so what we saw was either a really big UFO or an amazing meteor! I've watched meteor showers before, and none of the ones I've seen can compare. To give you an idea of it's size, I'd say that a dime held out at arm's length would be about right.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
glowing green ball of fire;2008-11-20 22:05:00;10 sec;glowing green ball of fire While traveling home to Savannah, GA from NC on I-95 mile post marker 36 just north of Hwy 17 exit I witnessed a glowing green fireball just above the tree line.  It appeared from my perspective to be the size of a basketball traveling south.  I know other people had to have seen it and would like to know if anyone did.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Bright fireball in sky moving east.;2014-06-20 22:51:00;15 seconds;Bright fireball in sky moving east. 10:51 pm  Saw a bright orange light coming from the east.  Began as a bright light, and slowly got smaller and light became less visible.   Slowly became invisible for about 5 seconds.  Then became bright again and continued to travel east at a dimmer brightness before disappearing.   Had 2 military men present and neither knew what it could be.   It looked like a fireball and transitioned into something that looked like a birdie. I tried video-taping, but my iphone wouldn't pick it up.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Bright light, glowing red object, neon lights/tubes begin the glow!  ((NUFORC Note:  Very reliable, and qualified, witnesses.  PD));2014-11-21 23:05:00;3 minutes;Bright light, glowing red object, neon tubes begin the glow. On Friday evening, November 21, at 23:05 hours, I was onboard ((company name deleted//a cruise ship) from the Caribbean.  We were sailing north and I was looking out of my stateroom window located on the starboard side of the ship.  I observed a extremely bright light which I believe was on the water.  I could not tell the distance of the object or ship.   While looking at the object, I observed a orange glowing light traveling from the direction of the light with a trajectory towards the ship.  The object's trajectory was arching up and quickly traveled over the top of the ship.   As the object was being observed, the neon light tubes on the stateroom mirror began to glow.  This continued for about one or two minutes, then stopped.  The bright light on the ocean appeared to be stationary.   We were traveling at about 14 knots.  The bright light eventually left my field of vision towards the ships stern.  This event was also observed by my wife.  (It is noted the size of the very bright light was about the size of a pencil eraser including the halo surrounding the light.)   My best guest of the location was between Jacksonville Florida and Brunswick Georgia. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with both the husband and wife, and we deem them to be exceptionally qualified, and exceptionally credible, as witnesses.  The report originally indicated that the sighting had occurred on a Saturday night, but the witness corrected it to Friday, November 21st, 2014.  PD));32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Red spherical light near Bull River.  ((anonymous report));2016-09-26 21:20:00;5 seconds;Red spherical light near Bull River. At approximately 21:20 on Monday, September 26, 2016, my wife and I were traveling from Tybee Island, GA to our home on Whitemarsh Island/Savannah, GA. As we approached the Bull River Bridge on Highway 80 we could see a bright red ball high in the night sky.  My wife noticed it first and attempted to point it out to me.  I glanced up and saw it as well. It took a moment for us to orient ourselves to its height in the sky.  Within a second it disappeared completely from our view.  I noted that there was another aircraft in the sky…something that looked to either be civilian or military. As we passed over Bull River Bridge onto Wilmington Island, we noted that the second aircraft that we saw seemed to be roaming the sky and not on any particular trajectory. It should be noted that the red ball also did not have a downward trajectory.  From what I could tell the movements were subtle or stationary as it glowed and then disappeared…therefore it did not seem to be a meteorite. This was a brief sighting so it would be difficult to speculate on what the object could have been, but the situation was odd to us, nonetheless.
