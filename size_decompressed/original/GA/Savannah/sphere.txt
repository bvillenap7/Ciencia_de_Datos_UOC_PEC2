It went into the clouds and that was the last I saw it. The Winds were easterly (clouds moving easterly) but the dot seemed like it was moving across the wind. I managed to get a photo.  Not sure if it's a weather balloon or ufo?  I tried to blow up the image but at 200 % just a blurry white dot. A military Helicopter had just passed below it heading south, this is what brought my attention to look skyward. I was in my backyard. It looked like it went into the cloud, but it may have been above the cloud.  Straight direction, steadfast in its course.  It was traveling faster than the clouds. Seems to me that if it were a weather balloon it would be traveling the same speed and direction as the cloud.  In the time from when I snapped the  photo to when it went into the cloud I could not get another photo.  It was traveling every bit as fast as the helicopter.  The whole incident probably took 15 seconds, seven seconds for me to go in get the camera off the coffee table, come out, find the object again, focus, snap the picture. Maybe 45 degrees of arc total.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Blue /Silver objects over Savannah;2011-11-12 23:30:00;3 minutes;Blue /Silver objects over Savannah 3 large blue and silver objects were seen hovering above Talmudge Bridge.  The objects were stationary in a standard triangle formation.  After about 45 seconds they began to move and seemed to stack one on the other with visible distance between them.  They then began moving North and upward.  The top craft released one small, broad yellow burst.  Once they began moving they were out of sight in about 30 seconds.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221

Watched a 3-4 in sphere come in one end of development and slowly move thru park.  A neonish blue that seemed to be a glow, but didn't shine.  Don't know any other way to describe it.  Floated by me about 20-25 ft away about 12-14 ft off the ground.  No sound.

Triangle formation of orbs or spheres over Savannah.;2019-06-25 16:30:00;30 seconds;Triangle formation of orbs or spheres over Savannah I had just moved my yard chair around to the side of the garage in back of the house to get out of the sun.It was nice and  shady there and I was looking up at a big sweet gum tree that needs a couple of big limbs removed that hang over the house.  I noticed a jet traveling north at a high altitude with no vapor trail and wondered why there was no vapor trail because it was cloudless bluebird sky.  Right then I noticed three round pearly white orbs or spheres traveling due south and they appeared to be much lower in the sky.  They were in a triangle formation and were moving a bit in the formation but maintaining the triangle.  They were probably at 11:00 position in the sky.  They were moving across the sky at what appeared to me at the same speed as the jet traveling in the other direction.  I thought to run grab the binoculars, but wouldnâ€™t have had time.  They were about to go behind the tree and the front one became two (2) right before it went out of sight behind the sweet gum.  I jumped up and ran inside through the the house and out the front to try and see them further but did find them with all the trees around.  There was no sound from them.  End.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
