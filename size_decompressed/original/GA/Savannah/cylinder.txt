I noticed a white cylinder object moving through the sky.  It made no sound and no exhaust trail.  It was moving south.   As it moved out of sight, I saw another object, same as last, but moving north.  I watched the sky and saw 2 more going south and 2 more going north.  They were timed at 5 minute apart .;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
