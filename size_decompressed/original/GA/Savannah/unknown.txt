I've told no one but will keep looking an try to get some on film if at all possible there is something out there ((NUFORC Note--The Geminid Meteor Shower peaked during the evening hours on this date.  That may explain the object, but that is only a guess.));32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Slow moving object (like a helicopter) - bean of light coming out of bottom - disappeared suddenly;2001-06-25 21:00:00;2 mins;Slow moving object (like a helicopter) - bean of light coming out of bottom - disappeared suddenly The craft was flying slowly, like a helicopter. It made no noise, and a light was shining out of the bottom like a spotlight. Suddenly the point of light disappeared, and only a diffused light beam could be seen. Seconds later, this disappeared. It could have been a helicopter, but it was strange that it disappeared so abruptly, and there was no sound! ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the cluster of reports that appear her for the evening of Monday, June 25, 2001, were caused by the launch of an ICBM by the U. S. Navy from the Kennedy Space Center at approximately 2115 hrs. (EDT).  We are grateful to the FAA Military Liason office in Jacksonville, FL the USAF 45th RANDS unit and the Naval Operations and Testing Unit (NOTU) for their assistance in our attempt to determine the cause of these reports.  A similar test was conducted by the USS West Virginia submarine off the east coast of Florida on March 07, 1998, which caused similar reports.  PD));32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221

What caught my attention was that these were the two brightest objects in that portion of the sky. It was a very clear night with no clouds.  The moon was very bright about 45 degrees above the horizon in the Eastern sky.  It did not take me long to realize that the lights which at first appeared as bright stars, one in front of the other, were actually moving on a straight course across the sky towards the Southeast.  At first I thought the two lights might have been connected.  I ran into the house and got binoculars.  By the time I came out there was only one light directly overhead.  Through the binoculars I could vaguely see some kind of structure illuminated by the single bright light.  As I was watching through the binoculars the light gradually faded out.  I assume the same thing happened to the other light (object) while I was getting the binoculars.  Although the speed across the sky was constant and similar to that of an airplane, there was no noise and no other lights.  It's not unusual to see the flashing lights of an airplane and not hear it.  I'm guessing that the objects were about 10 thousand feet elevation.  Could this have been a pair of stealth fighters going into stealth mode? ((NUFORC Note:  The Space Shuttle, followed by the Space Station, passed over Savannah at 20:04 hrs. on October 16, 2002.
