I was a US Army Ranger stationed at Hunter Army Airfield 1981-84,  It was day time, very cloudy day. I just happened to look up while walking toward my barracks and saw what looked like a giant construction crane high in the sky and in an opening above the clouds.  It was gray, or white but metallic.  It was day time so I saw no lights at all. It moved smoothly but quickly as if cruising and then disappeared above the clouds.   I never saw it again and it only lasted seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Big black rectangle over Georgia.;2011-12-31 22:20:00;20 minutes;Big Black Rectangle over Georgia I was flying home (Miami) from New York City where I work as a Flight Attendant.  I was pass riding, sitting on the right side of aircraft, about 4 seat rows from the back of aircraft.  Just as the cockpit crew made the announcement that we were passing over Savannah, GA, I happened to look outside the window next to my seat and saw this very big black rectangular object crossing over our aircraft at a height of about 1 thousand feet above us. It was a black long & wide rectangle, no markings on it, even though there was a full moon, no light reflected off it.  It only had 3 lights one white light in front which which covered the whole width of the rectangle, a red light which covered the whole back of it and one red light underneath it which flashed slowly unlike man made aircrafts, I watched it till it disappeared in the horizon.  When I disembarked at MIA, I asked the pilot standing by the cockpit door whether he saw the object and he refused to talk about it.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
