My sister noticed it and we all looked up and saw it.  It was a large V-shaped craft with dimly glowing lights on the underside.   It flew completely soundless and in a steady straight path.  It seemed to come from northwest and fly south southeast.   It was only in view for a few seconds.  It was somewhat hard to see.  It wasn't well lit, so it blended in with the sky a little bit.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
