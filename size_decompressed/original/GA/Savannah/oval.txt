This giantic safety-pin shaped ufo makes contact with 4 floating disc.;2001-08-15 14:00:00;20 minutes;This giantic safety-pin shaped ufo makes contact with 4 floating disc. I'ts early morning, 3 or 4 o'clock am.  I look up in the sky and suspended in the air approximately 50 feet is giantic device.  At first, I do not recognize this thing suspended in the air as a ufo because it does not look like other ufo's I have seen photo's of on television or in books.  Then I realise that this device is not a plane, or a jet, or a helicopter or anything I would know, and more importantly this huge thing is suspended about 50 feet in the air. And even though this ufo did not have lights as we know lights, like head lights or flood lights ect...the craft was illuminated.  As if a dull light was woven into the blackish metallic metal looking material that made up the craft. The device looks like a giantic safety-pin, with two circular points at both ends and long cylindrial tubes connecting both ends.  I become very fearful and think to myself that perhaps I have gone unnoticed by this device and I should calmly walk on to the house.  That is when 4 disc shaped objects float out of the far end of the device and approach me.  I stand  frozen as 3 disc pass very close by me and the 4th disc hazes my right arm.  As the 4th disc hazes my right arm a vibration runs through my body.  Scared I walk briskly up the drive to my house and do not look back. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate in August 2001.

Large, grey, and oval in shape.  It had a bright green halo of light surrounding it.   It arched in terms of flight pattern and disappeared completely before it met the horizon.   Have never seen anything like it before and feel very unsettled.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
