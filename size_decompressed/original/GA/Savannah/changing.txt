Observed Cluster of Bright, Dynamically Changing Lights.;2014-04-05 01:22:00;2 hours;Observed Cluster of Bright, Dynamically Changing Lights. A cluster. that is pulsating, with large reddish round circle in middles that rotates around as objects that look octagon in shape and electrical in coloring, moving rapidly  and changing forms. It looks alive. Looks like center sphere that glows red with multiple smaller bright yellow hemispheres all around the middle, like a gumball or stickerball (sand spur).  Rotates around so that the yellow points appear to revolve around red center and change the overall shape of the object but there is a steady pattern to the change.  Resembles a cell undergoing miosis (cell division) in that the yellow lights move around and through the center red glow.  Appears to shape shift. Has been under steady observation for about 45 minutes, under which time it has dramatically changed sky position from the area of initial sighting to an area of the sky about 12 inches away.  Given that the object appears as far-off as a star might, this is a significant change in sky position.  Change in position was gradual and slow and tabulated with long periods of static hovering in one fixed position. Resembles a space jellyfish or a space worm or even a giant bug.  Again, this is a bright object that is brighter than the other stars in the sky.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
One large dark object, one tiny. Over Savannah river.;2014-08-02 14:30:00;>1 minute;One large dark object, one tiny.  Over Savannah river. There were two objects appearing to move from over Savannah towards the South Carolina border.  One was extremely small appearing like a dark dot in the sky.  The other was large and oval shaped from my view.  Some movements were erratic, and both objects seemed to sometimes hover.  They both went in and out of clouds.   This was from a fairly large distance.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
