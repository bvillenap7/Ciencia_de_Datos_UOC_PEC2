Golden cigar shaped UFO.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from MUFON Field Investigator and former Section Director.  PD));1975-08-01 14:30:00;2-3 seconds;Golden cigar shaped UFO I was riding my motorcycle to work, just passing the Savannah Golf Club. Traffic was light and I was going 35-40 mph.  It was mostly cloudy with occasional patches of blue sky. I glanced over at the golf course and saw through a break in the clouds a large, gold colored cigar shaped flying object leaving a smoke trail.  It was off in distance but was traveling horizontal from north to south.  After watching it incredulously for a couple of seconds I looked away to pull off on the side of the road.  After I got the bike stopped I looked back to where it had been but there was nothing there anymore.  I watched for  couple of minutes to see if I could see it in any other breaks in the clouds with no luck.  When it became obvious it was gone I got back on my bike and rode on to work.  I didn't report it or tell too many people what I had seen. I was 23 at the time and taking time off from college.  Shortly after that I went back to college and finished my BA Psychology.  That, and another incident, spawned a lifelong interest in UFOs.  I am a MUFON Field Investigator and have been a MUFON state section director.

I looked out of my bathroom window and saw a cigar-shaped object with a comet-like contrail following behind it. I called my family out to the balcony to see it. After a few seconds of everyone seeing it, it stopped making a contrail, hovered for a moment, then quickly landed.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
