Strange spinning lights behaving strangely in downtown Savannah;1995-09-01 10:00:00;3 minutes;Strange spinning lights behaving strangely in downtown Savannah It was quite a while ago, & I never thought to report it. There were 3 lights in the shape of a triangle at first that rose in the sky near Broughton St. in Sav. GA. They began to spin into a diamond shape then stopped  dead in the sky, then just plummeted to below the horizon. My friend & I were so scared that we just grabbed each other & shook for a few minutes. We both assurred each other that we had wittnessed the same thing. I guess that's all I can say. Thank you, M. I never had seen anything similar befor. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221

Went below tree line before I saw it reach ground so no good estimate of size.  After dark a couple hours later at least one helicopter was hovering/circling marsh area for over 30 minutes.
