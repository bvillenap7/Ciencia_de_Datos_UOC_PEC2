A  V formation of five lights moved silently at a high rate of speed from East to West at 22:30 EST 5 Nov 07;2007-11-05 22:30:00;5 seconds;A  V formation of five lights moved silently at a high rate of speed from East to West at 22:30 EST 5 Nov 07 While facing East Northeast observing the 17P Holmes Comet I caught movement to my left (generally North of the Comet) and immediately looked to see if it was a plane. What I spotted was what appeared to be either five individual lights traveling in a V formation from East to West or a single object with five lights. The lights were a dull red/amber color and as bright as an average star in the sky. The object(s) moved at a high rate of speed but made absolutely no sound as they moved across the sky. I immediately called to my wife to look at them, but they went behind some trees before she saw them. Just before the lights disappeared behind the trees the lights changed their relative position in relation to each other as if it were a single object that was beginning to bank and the lights were moving accordingly. Sky conditions were clear and there was no moon.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
8-12 lights viewed in the skies of Savannah, GA moving very fast and in unison.;2008-11-21 01:20:00;30 seconds- 2 minutes;8-12 lights viewed in the skies of Savannah, GA moving very fast and in unison. 8-12 bright white lights shooting across the sky from what looked to be near Orin's belt. The lights moved from above my head toward the horizon all in unison then continued straight up into the sky, again in unison.  About a minute after another set of lights were seen moving across the horizon in the shape of a circle (each light hovering around a centered location.  I heard no noises.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
3 slow moving lights in triangular formation over Savannah, GA;2010-08-09 21:28:00;20 minutes;3 slow moving lights in triangular formation over Savannah, GA As I was driving home, I noticed 3 lights in the sky in a triangular formation, two on top and one on the bottom, and the bottom one being much brighter than the other two.  I pulled over to watch them and videoed for 20 minutes.  While videoing them, they didn't appear to be moving.  After review of the video, they were indeed moving slowly, noticed by a point of reference in the video. I thought possibly it was a bright star or planet (even though I have never seen a star or planet this bright), so I rushed home to grab my camera and tripod.  I was going to attempt to do a long exposure photograph that would capture the star trails as the earth spun to see if these lights were of the same pattern.  As I went back out to the vicinity of the lights, I noticed they were much farther away.  They were moving in a west / south-west direction.  I attempted to get on the interstate to follow them (I-16 west), but they were moving too fast for me to keep up and eventually I lost them in the trees in the western sky.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
5 white lights hovering.;2015-08-05 21:45:00;1 minute;5 White Lights hovering I was driving down Bay street about to approach I-516 on ramp,  I saw 5 straight white lights hovering which looked like an aircraft coming in for landing, but there were no runways in that direction and it didn't appear to be moving.   It then started to bank like it was turning, but it kept banking doing a complete 180 degrees.  I lost it as I approached the on ramp to I-516.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
