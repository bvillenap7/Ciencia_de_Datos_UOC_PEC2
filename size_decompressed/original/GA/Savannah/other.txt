the space craft appeared out of no where and had no noise to it at all.;1999-06-16 21:00:00;2minutes;the space craft appeared out of no where and had no noise to it at all. it was over the large mall in savannah. directly behind the mall is a army base. the object was around 1 1/2 city blocks long and was fairly thick in width. it had no noise and it appeared to be white or siver in color. the color did appear to change when it moved.  it appeared very quickly and was hovering for a short period of time . it then started to move very slowly at first and then it dissapeared before we could keep  our eyes on it. it had no visible windows and no apparent lights. it was shaped kind of like a long rectangle with rounded sides. it also had no wings of any sort. we were in the pool playing around and if i had not noticed that i could not see the stars i would not have seen it. the helicopters at the army abse started flying around the area less than 1 minute of its departure. they appeared to be looking for it and searched with lights for about an hour before they went back to the base. we have not seen that on again. we are sure it was not a plane, as we would surely see it from time to time.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Savannah Morning Possible UFO;2009-05-24 04:00:00;1/2 hour;Savannah Morning Possible UFO In the horizon, there was an object that emit a strong light as it seemed to be moving upward. The object's illumination was similar to a space rocket from a far distance except the object seemed to be accelerating at an unusually fast pace. The object seemed to fly a circular path before coming down to a similar height it took off from, except the landing site was a bit to the right. The object then proceeded to hover from left to right, giving no evidence of increasing its altitude (and at irregular speeds, sometimes it would move faster to the right then left and vice versa). This continued on for 15 minutes before the object stopped. This was when the shape of the object became clearer. The streak of light seemed to possess a spherical center with trails of light both above and below it. The trails of light seemed to contract into the sphere and extend back out periodically. This happened for another ten minutes before the object stayed still. Within 5 seconds of it stopping, rain began and the objected became less visible and dissapeared. The rain stopped and the object seemed to appear again with another just like it except with a darker shade.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
