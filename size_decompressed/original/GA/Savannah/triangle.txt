very low , triangle shaped craft, with no sound;1980-09-24 23:59:00;5 min.;very low , triangle shaped craft, with no sound My husband ,2 daughters and I were returning from a visit with my in-laws in Savannah.The kids were sleeping,and it was a warm night,so we had the truck windows down.We were going west,and at the time of sighting,there were fields,on each side of the road.I looked out of my window,to the right,and saw a large dark object flying low ,over the field ,about to enter the road .I told my husband to look and he stoped our truck to look.The object was flying very low,and slow moving,it was triangle shaped ,I would say about 21/2 to 3 times size of our truck.The object came over our truck,so low ,that I think ,that if I was on the hood, I would have been able to touch it.I looked out of the back truck window ,checking to see if any one was coming behind us ,that might have seen it too.I saw a vehicle in the distance, and it looked like it was stoping. We could hear no sound at all from the object,I saw white lights underneath but I can't remember in what shape and pattern.It was a clear night,and the object was dark colored ,I would say black.When the object went over us, it went over the field on the left,never getting any higher up,and not changing speed. I am a christian,and I know that my church does not believe in ufo's and related things,but I know what I have seen,and I know that they are real. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Stadium sized triangular craft with red blue and green lights hovered over trees in silence on Ga. night 1985 /6;1985-12-15 23:00:00;don't know;Stadium sized triangular craft with red blue and green lights hovered over trees in silence on Ga. night 1985 /6 This was a long time ago and frankly it took me a long time to assimilate the memory. I was driving home from school for Christmas break and I was in the middle on the countryside between Savannah and Warner Robins Air Force Base, but slightly south, if you were to draw a line. It was a clear night and the sky was filled with stars. I noticed there were several cars pulled to the side of the road in front of me. There was no other traffic and they still had lights on etc. People were standing by their cars and looking southeast over a field and above a pine forest. When I looked I saw a triangular shape that was indescribably huge. It was defined by colored lights. I think they were red blue and green, and I think they were in the corners and maybe along the edge of the triangle. It was hovering not far above the trees at a distance of maybe a couple or three hundred yards from yhe road. Even at this distance it was enormous, as if a football stadium had taken flight. Of course, as things go, this is all I can remember. I didn't even remember this for a long time and even then I wasn't sure it was real until I heard someone describing the same thing on Coast to Coast with Art Bell. The memory loss I can not explain but I understand that it is not entirely uncommon, although these days more people seem to be seeing these things. I can't imagine that it was man made...we are simply not that scientifically advanced. It was huge, motionless, and silent.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
On a trip to Savannah,GA, my wife and I saw an strange object in the sky about 15 miles away from the Savannah exit on U.S.80.;2004-04-07 21:30:00;30 sec;On a trip to Savannah, GA, my wife and I saw an strange object in the sky about 15 miles away from the Savannah exit on U.S.80. My wife and I were making our way to savannah from newnan,ga. It was a little after 9:30 pm when we came within 15 miles of the savannah exit on U.S. 80. I looked of to the left because I thought I saw a deer by the median. I began to slow down when I caught a glimpse of an object going behind the tree lines. I told my wife to put the video camera on nightshot and record the object.We had been to savannah the year before and saw alot of military aircraft. I thought this was one of them so I wanted to get it on camera. It looked like it was preparing to land from what I could tell. I noticed a clearing of the tree tops just ahead in it's path. When the craft got to the clearing, I realized this was no military craft. I was triangular in shape, black, very smooth texture,very areo dynamic. It's lights were not flashing as an airplane's landing lights would. I knew this thing wasn't a plane, it wasn't a steath bomber, I have seen those before.I rolled down the window and slowed down to see If I could hear the engine. I work at a major airport and I have heard many different engines. I heard nothing. Not a sound. We had a fully charged battery when we began our trip and there is pretty much nothing on the way there for us to record. I know we didn't waste the battery before this and my wife told me she got the object on camera.As soon as the craft dropped behind the tree line my wife told me the battery was going dead.When we got to our hotel room, I charged the camera. When I went to watch the event on tape, I couldn't find It anywhere on the tape. It went from just before I told my wife to put the camera on nightshot to well after the inncident,close to our exit. I don't know what I saw that night or what happened during the time we lost on camera. One thing I do know, Is that I want to find out.

Moon surface ufo sighting;2004-08-15 03:00:00;1 minute;Moon surface ufo sighting In August of 2004 I was looking at the moon through my telescope.  I changed lenses and just as I looked through the telescope again I saw something huge moving across the bottom of the moon.  I saw only part of it as it moved past.   A second after it was gone I saw a black triangular shaped object that came from the exact place where the large object had disappeared.   n the attached drawing I have done my best to illustrate what I saw and show the path of the second object.   Once the objects had moved from the light of the moon I lost sight of them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD));32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Orbs spotted over savannah and s.c..;2012-12-31 23:45:00;10 minutes;orbs spotted over savannah and s.c. I was working my second job as security officer for a business downtown not far from the Savannah River when one of the residents pointed at sky and asked, What the ---- is that?  I looked up and saw three red or s in the shape of a large triangle. \ About ten other residents saw the objects? but only the initial spotter would accompany me as I walked about block, following the object.  A few minutes later a single or.  Appeared following the triangle-shaped orbs.   My job's property wouldn't allow me to go further than a block, but as I continued following the single red orb with my eyes, another single appeared. and that was followed by another they were all traveling across Savannah towards South Carolina.   Later, that night, about 1:40am., while I was escorting the nurse, we both saw four red orbs traveling fro  South Carolina side of the river.  I managed to video one of the orbs with my cell.  I would have videoed more but I just assumed that someone was just releasing lanterns or playing a prank   I thought I might have captured something when I went on the internet and saw so many reports of the same thing.   How could I have seen the same thing as others from around the country?;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Triangle formation with 3 lights in sky over Savannah, Georgia, witnessed by entire group of people.;2018-05-05 00:00:00;We witnessed it last for ;Triangle formation with 3 lights in sky over Savannah, Georgia witnessed by entire group of people While on a ghost tour of the city of Savannah, one of the members in our group looked up into the sky while we were at our last stop (Colonial Cemetary) and alerted us to the fact that there was something unusual in the sky.  Our entire group witnessed what looked to be a triangle formation in the sky.  It had 3 lights, 2 red and the front point was a white light.  It hovered there in the sky (absolutely no movement or sound) for about 1 minute then slowly seemed to disappear as clouds moved in under it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and found her to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  She will attempt to have one of several witnesses to the event to send supplementary report.  PD));32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Triangle/boomerang shaped craft spotted over Savannah highway.;2019-03-09 01:00:00;unknown;Triangle/boomerang shaped craft spotted over Savannah highway. I saw this really massive yet slow moving boomerang-shaped aircraft more or less floating over the highway as I was leaving Savannah last night around 1am.  It was massive yet was really quiet, if not totally inaudible.   It was moving slowly enough that I could have taken a clear photo of it if it hadn't been so dark (and if I hadn't been driving at close to 70mph in the opposite direction). It had several white lights on the bottom of it (the part you could actually see from the ground) and one flashing red light.  It came from the west and then appeared to begin following the highway into the city.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
hovering triangle over highway;2021-08-10 22:00:00;1 minute;hovering triangle over highway Was driving southbound on rt 95 near the Savannah Intl airport and saw,  through the top left hand corner of the windshield 4 bright white lights move from a diagonal position into a a horizontal position approximately 200-300 ft high...seemed very odd...I slowed down to keep watching (this became dangerous on the highway) and began looking for structure under the lights like a pole, etc...wasnt sure if it was a billboard...as I moved past it, it was very clear that this was NOT a pole/streetlight/etc - it was a soft triangle (rounded corners) and was hovering...seemingly facing north...I would guess, based on the elevation, that it was approx 150'-200' wide;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
