I saw a star that moved about in a very strange, rapid manner the night sky over Savannah, Georgia late in 1986;1986-11-15 21:00:00;3 to 5 minutes;I saw a star that moved about in a very strange, rapid manner the night sky over Savannah, Georgia late in 1986 One cold night in November of 1986, I had gone to the roof of my dorm building in Savannah, Georgia (When I was a student at Savannah College of Art and Design there) to sit back, away from the din of noise of other students inside the building below me, to listen to a cassette tape of music and just look at the stars as I had often done.  I hadn't been there but a couple of minutes when I saw what looked like the most amazing meteor entering the atmosphere. It was very bright and distinct and traveled from east to west almost traversing the entire sky. When it got to the far western region of the sky it began to dim and then it did something I wasn't ready for, it stopped cold.  At first I thought I had lost it behind a bright star or that my eyes had picked up a star instead. And then the star moved again. From an absolute stopped point, it streaked from it's resting point in the west to a point up and behind my head in the south (I was sitting facing due north). At this point I had to sit up and had turned my head to follow this Star as I had not been prepared for this event. Amazingly, right after stopping for about a count of 3 to 5 seconds, the star moved very abruptly from it's position in the south to one to the far north eastern sky and stopped again. At this point I remember thinking that this wasn't right. Stars don't do this. It was new to me to ever see anything like this and I don't think I was aware yet that I was seeing a UFO as it were, I just was so blown away. After a few moments where it was, the star shot off to the south again aand was gone.  I was so blown away that I just sort of slumped back down and lay there stunned. I actually remember feeling very scared and felt like I wasn't supposed to have seen that or something. People always say that they want to see a UFO and it had never occurred to me that it would scare the crap out of me. I was so scared, lying there exposed on that rooftop, that I remember I couldn't move for what seemed like a long time. It may have just been minutes, but it seemed like a very long time. A deer in the headlights effect I guess.  I finally got my wits together and left the roof very rapidly and went inside to tell my friends what I saw. The most frustrating thing about it was that I had been alone and that every single person looked at me with this very condescending smile that made me very angry. I wish anybody else could have seen this amazing thing.  I don't now what I saw but I do know that it wasn't birds in the night lights, or a jet, or anything I have ever seen before or since. It moved very fast and in a way that made no sense. It went from absolute still to absolute motion across the sky in a moment, and stopped just as fast.  Whatever it was, either we have very amazing machines in thhis world that no one knows about or it was something else. But it was something and it was real. In some ways I hope I never see anything like it again. It makes one feel very small.  I hope that thsi report isn't too old or anything but it was an amazing thing to see and I felt compelled to tell you this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.

Dense , vertical, angular column of white light shines down in to my yard at 3:42 a.m. 3/28/01.;2001-03-28 03:42:00;3 seconds;Dense , vertical, angular column of white light shines down in to my yard at 3:42 a.m. 3/28/01. I did not see the craft. I had let my beagle out in the back yard to go to the bathroom. It was cold so I closed the sliding glass door and cupped my hands and put my face againest the glass so I could see her in the yard.  It was dark, no moonlight,just a stray of light from the street lights from the front of the house.  I lost site of the dog and was straining to see when a hot white vertical column of light shone down into the yard over our two empty garden spots. The light shone in a very angular way.  First more square and then it elongated as it moved towards me and the house. So now it looks like a wall of white light as it expands towards me, almost like a door sliding open, and then it stops about 15 feet from the house and the back or the light moves forward and it becomes a column of light again, and then it is gone.  This all happened in 1-3 seconds.  My dog did not react to the light-I don't know if she saw it. The light was intensely white but did not shine outside it's boundaries and was as tall has I could see. You could not see through it. It moved very quickly and was gone.  Afterwards, as I tried to make it all logical, I thought it must be the coast guard helicopter. But as I slid open the door and stepped out to look up -I realized at the same time that I heard not a sound from anything. Not a copter, not a plane. It immediately frightend me and I stepped back in the house. But I was still trying to work it out.  I knew that a street light on the street behind us shone on and off every half a minute or so. I waited for it to come on and could not get the same effect-- I fogged up the glass door-several times- could not get the same effect when the street light came on. After this I woke my husband up and told him what had happened because it was so surreal. I never did see or try to see a craft after I became frightened.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Flashing object in western sky, blue, red, amd amber lights, never moving, just flashing slow then fast;2003-09-01 23:30:00;30-45min;Flashing object in western sky, blue, red, amd amber lights, never moving, just flashing slow then fast I was on the deck around 2330. I saw Mars off to my east, I turned and thought I saw the strobe of an aircraft off to the west of me. I noticed that it was not moving , it looked like a chritsmas light, flashing red, blue, and amber colour. I grabed a pair of binoculors and it was so far off that I could only see the lights flashing and changing. I could not see a shape. I thought it was a star - but I noticed that the other stars were not flashing or changing light texture. I sat down and watched through the binoculors, it barley moved (or it was me shaking the binoc's). At some points it would flash rapidly and then slow way down, seem to growlarger then back off, all the while the lights flashed blue, red, and amber(or white. The clouds passed infront of myself and the object, I went inside when it started to rain ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a twinkling star.  PD));32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Red blinking light appears three times, changing speed and direction many times before fading away.;2004-10-16 03:30:00;about 30 seconds;Red blinking light appears three times, changing speed and direction many times before fading away. It was extremely clear and cool outside around 3:00 in the morning and my friend and I decided to lay out on our roof and watch the stars for awhile. After laying there about fifteen minutes I saw a shooting star. And then after another fifteen minutes or so, I saw what at first looked like another shooting star, but it was not moving at the same velocity and it was very red (red like a star looks red, not like a cherry red) and blinking. The blinking looked more like a change in light intensity and I then thought it was a satellite because of the blinking and because it was moving along so steadily and it didn't come and go quickly like a shooting star would. It just kept cruising along. After a few seconds of this, I pointed at it and began to exclaim to my friend that a satellite was moving over us. As I began to speak, I noticed a slight slowing of the light's pace, and then a sudden stop. It hung in place for about half a second and then moved left at a slower speed. After a second of this, it stopped again and began to curve down and to the right. It was about then that my friend noticed it. It curved for a couple seconds and quickly moved back to the left and it rapidly alternated between a fast and slow pace. It then slowed drastically and drifted upwards and it faded away next to a fairly bright star.  This all occured in a span of time no greater than thirty seconds. The red blinking light came back two more times and followed a similar type of pattern. It would appear in the same area of the sky as it had before, and it would move in one direction for a few seconds and then it would constantly alter its speed and direction until it finally slowed and would always return to the same area in the sky before fading away.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
5 minutes of visability, 45 degrees high, moving from the northeast to the southwest;2004-11-17 05:44:00;5 minutes;5 minutes of visability, 45 degrees high, moving from the northeast to the southwest While driving to work (west on highway 80) i noticed what looked like a ball of light moving from the northeast to the southwest. At first i thought i was watching the international space station.  The light was one of the brightest stars in the sky but moving just fast enought o realize it was not a star.  Then i realized the light could not be the space station because it was going the wrong direction.  I followed it while driving and then it just disapeared.  It was as if it had moved far enough to the west to not be illuminated by the sun.  The light was about 45 gedrees high and moving in a straight line.  It did appear that the color was constant, a white/blue color.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221
Orange flashing light over army base shoots into space at impossible speed;2008-07-19 21:00:00;5 min;Orange flashing light over army base shoots into space at impossible speed I was 15 at the time, my Dad, Grandmother, and Mom were all on a dock south of Savannah, Ga. (We were all sober, no drugs, perfectly normal)  My whole family and I had always been skeptical of UFOs until that night in mid July of 2008. My dad saw an orange star hovering high above the army base 10 miles north west of us. He said it was Mars, but Mars was in the opposite side of the sky, and not nearly as orange. The bright orange light over the base started blinking on and off for a minute. Then it made a small circle around the area over the base and stopped where it started. Its movement was swift and seemingly impossible. The orange object glowed brighter and brighter orange and started flashing on and off. It then stopped flashing and shot across the sky at an impossible speed.  It looked like warp speed on star wars. The bright orange light zoomed into space in less than a second.

Light trail Near Crossroads Parkway and Jimmy DeLoach in Savannah, GA.;2014-01-07 07:10:00;5-7 seconds;Light trail Near Crossroads Parkway and Jimmy DeLoach in Savannah, GA On my way to work this morning at Gulfstream, I was driving on Jimmy Deloach Parkway where Crossroads Parkway intersects.  The sky was bluish with clouds, and no other stars that I could see. I checked.  There was one aircraft far in the distance that I could see through my front windshield.  To the right of the car, there was another bright pinpoint of light that caught my attention.  It was small and bright, like a star, but a much brighter.  Three seconds later, it shot straight forward in a streak of light.  The light trail was like a shooting star, but much brighter.  The streak, also, ran parallel to the light, instead of descending.  I have never seen anything like that I don't know what it was.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221

What appeared to be shooting star did loop over army airfield.;2014-08-26 01:05:00;5-10 seconds;What appeared to be shooting star did loop over army airfield. Single orange dot moved from over tybee island (E) to hunter army airfield (SW) in about three seconds.  By speed appeared to be shooting star with no tail, when over HAAF, did loop de loop, yawed left/right a few times then orange light when off, without fading.   No noise was heard at time of sighting, amd being 1 am on weekday, no traffic or other noises where covering faint sounds.   Did not match military aircraft normally seen in area, speed should have produced audible somic boom even at high altitude, and playful manuevers are not allowed inside airfields airspace.;32.0242446666668;-81.1162122222221

Then before it would have hit or collided with anything it disappears again. It was three white yellowish lights next to each other.  Seemingly on a oval like craft.
