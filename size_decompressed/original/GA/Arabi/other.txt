I then saw a massive object come out of the clouds with great speed and other worldly maneuvering.   The craft was about 1 1/2 miles up the interstate ahead of me.  Then two more joined it and they filled and circled a few times before zooming back into the clouds.  They were like a triangle, but very rounded out.  Nothing was pointed they crafts were very smooth.   The size would be around 2 football fields in length.   They did not have lights and possibly created a haze around themselves but I couldn't tell because of all the clouds.;31.8469;-83.7265
