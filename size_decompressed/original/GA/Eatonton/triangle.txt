Triangular shaped object sighted that defied gravity and inertia.;1984-07-07 22:00:00;3-5 minutes;Triangular shaped object sighted that defied gravity and inertia. My ex-wife and a friend of ours were driving on highway Ga. 441 going south at around 10:00p.m.when we all observed what we thought initially was an airliner about the size of a 727 in a nose dive into a pasture on the east side of the road.The speed and angle of its descent made us believe that a loud crash was imminent so I slowed and stopped the car in the road since there was no other traffic. We heard nothing. Our friend, who was in the back seat said there it is and pointed above the trees that bordered the pasture about 100 yards off the side of the road. Above the trees,at about 100 ft. from the ground an elongated black triangle with a light at each corner floated noiselessly.One light was green, one red,and one was yellow. The red light was shining down into the trees and moved as if looking for something below. We observed this for about 2 minutes and decided that we did not want to be whatever it was looking for so we left. This was a clear, star filled sky. The aspect of this event that puzzled us as we discussed it on the way home was the speed of the object's descent and how it came to such an abrupt stop in mid-air. We dropped our friend at his residence and went to ours. My wife and I were pretty spooked and got no sleep that night. For some reason we never discussed this further within three weeks we broke up, got a divorce, and have had no contact since. Our friend moved away during this time and I have not been able to find him through family or friends.;33.3123;-83.3644000000001
