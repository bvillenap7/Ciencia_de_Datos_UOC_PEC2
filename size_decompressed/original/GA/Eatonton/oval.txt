On nov. 1 , 2006 at 3:47 AM at lake sinclair,Ga...I was leaning over the railing on my front deck looking at the ground and talking to a friend on my cell phone. All of a sudden I saw a bright blue light streaking across my front lawn. I then looked up into a clear sky and saw an object coming from my right to my left.. Whatever it was,it was round,bright blue and leaving a streak behind it, going at super-sonic speed.. I only saw it for about 8 - 10 seconds before it either flamed out or was too far away to see.. What did I see?..At first I thought it must of been a falling star but I tried a internet search and couldn't find anything about a falling star emitting a bright blue streak that could be seen on the ground.. The friend I was on the  phone with thinks it was a UFO...All I know is I saw what I saw.;33.3123;-83.3644000000001
