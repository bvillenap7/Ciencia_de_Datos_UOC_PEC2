Craft was hovering about 60 feet from ground above tops of pine trees. Disc shaped craft was a dull metal coloring (silver) and seemed to have panels (square in shape) along the entire circumference of the craft which lit, one after the other in a continuing pattern that repeated all the way around the base of the craft. Each panel was lit for well under a second of time before the panel next to it lit. Only one panel at a time would light. The light pattern moved in a counter-clockwise direction seemingly all the way around the craft continuously. There was no sound from this object. My sister and I watched this in awe for an undetermined length of time before it took off from a virtual standstill at a high rate of speed. We were in a car and tried to catch up with and locate this craft but could not find it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

I was riding along Ga rt 441 south of Eatonton, and stopped along the road to p.  I was right next to a fence that was along the hiway on a small inlet off the big lake. I could easily find that spot again, even after all these years. I was facing west while taking a pit stop and the sky was dark, starry, moonless, silent. I saw in the west three lights in a triangular formation. They were moving in a direction toward me very slowly in a path from due west to east. They were noiselss. All was silent and I would have heard any noise they made, as in a plane, or other known craft. I watched for many mins as they moved slowly across the sky. I then realized I had my 264 win mag rifle with me, it had a 3-9x40 scope on it. I got it out as they passed overhead and put the scope on 9x. I saw thru the scope three saucer shaped oblect with a bubble type turret or top. The lights seemed to eminate from a row of windows or whatever around each turret. The crafts were all three totally traditional 'flying saucer ' shape. I watched them thru the 9x rifle scope for a long time as they proceeded east into false dawn. Then they stopped totally and didnt move for many minutes. They seemed to just hang near the eastern horizon for a long time as I watched thru the rifle scope. It was getting lighter along the horizon at this time. Suddenly, and I mean suddenly, they streaked North and disappeared from my view. The speed which with they took off amazed me. It was instantaneous, a move north then GONE. I wasnt as shocked by the sighting as I was by the sudden disappearance. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.3123;-83.3644000000001
