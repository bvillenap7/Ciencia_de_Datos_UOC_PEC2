Normal air trafic travels in to hartsfield/jackson Atlanta in a general north to south pattern over my area. I notice a fast paced west/east light unlike my normal star gazing. As it caught my attention, it reminded me of another obeject in the sky that I had seen around 1998 or 1999. Not quite fast or brief enough to be a shooting star, the obect moved steadily at a very rapid pace. I say rapid based on judging against jumbo jets or either lower aircraft that a person usually hears to have that seemingly rate of movement. Even if it would have been low, it still would have been very fast.  As I watched it from the east, observing long enough to chain of thought the above mentioned, it stopped abruptly, and stood as though it was a very bright star. From my vantage point, it looked as though it added itself to the big dipper. No more than I thought to myself, What in the hell is that, it turned bright red and appeared to go straight up into the unknown at a very rapid pace. I only say up for the mear fact that the red light progressivly got harder to see until it just vanished.                                                                                   I love to spend my evenings sitting on my porch and gazing around, I do this every night, my two year old loves to come and sit with me and count airplanes. The last time I seen anything close to this, the object never stopped but was faster and quiter than anything I have ever gazed at. I wouldn't have even bothered to send this if I wouldn't have seen another mans sighting report on biography channel, and he stated the same, white light to red and then gone. Pretty cool whatever it was. And no, I'm not on drugs, ha, I think more of my C.D.L.'s than that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));34.5774;-83.5652
