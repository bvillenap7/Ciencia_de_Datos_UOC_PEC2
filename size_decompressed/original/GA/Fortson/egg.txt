I called my husband outside to look at it and he said that whatever it was was very low flying.  We know approximately the altitude of planes going over as we are used to that, yet this was different.  The craft moved at a high speed away from us going east where it started going up and down in the sky and changing colors (red, green, blue).   I freaked out and grabbed my phone and started recording.  At one point, another craft came up to it and then descended away.  The craft continued to hover for over an hour like that.   Being skeptical, I called the sheriff dept to see if anyone else had seen what we saw, no reports at the time of our call.we compared and contrasted through binoculars, the craft vs. Stars to make sure we were seeing what we thought we were and there was no comparison.   The shape appeared to be egg-like and continued to jolt around in the sky.  Several planes went around the object, flying higher or lower than normal.   We watched til we finally went to bed.;32.6271;-85.0031
