Descending flying double diamonds with long blue white double tail seen in horizon early morning;2019-04-04 06:55:00;5 minutes;Descending flying double diamonds with long blue white double tail seen in horizon early morning Saw descending flying or blinding object on horizon in early morning hours.  It appeared as a double diamond enveloped in flames with a long tail or double tail.  Object was dark.  Appeared to have blue white flame tail(s).  I was amazed at sight.  It had a slow linear descent at about -20 degrees.  Did not appear as meteor or meteorite which Iâ€™ve seen in the past.  Appeared large in the distance.  If meteor, it would have caused massive impact and explosion, but did not.  Object was hidden from view by trees in horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report provides a nice illustration of the two diamond-shaped craft, apparently coursing across the morning sky in close proximity to one another.
