Several flashing lights in various positions seen in the northern sky nightly.;2010-07-17 02:00:00;Several hours;Several flashing lights in various positions seen in the northern sky nightly. Every night, in the northern sky, I see several small flashing lights.  They appear in various places and are mostly stationary, however every occasionally they seem to make small circular movements and then return to the original position.  They do not appear in the same place every night.  At first I only noticed one at about 0300.  The next night I saw three.  Since then I have seen different numbers on different nights.  The lights seem to be white primarily but flash to blue and red. I don’t have access to a large telescope, but I did watch through a 60x spotting scope.  Through the spotting scope it appears that the red and blue lights are to the side of the white light, not the same light source changing color.  I was unable to see the shape of the object that the lights are coming from. I am police officer who works night shift and I told one of my squad mates about the light the first night I noticed it and he and I both spent about 15-20 minutes watching trying to figure it out.  About a week later the other officer told me that he pointed out the lights to a friend of his and the friend used his telescope (significantly stronger than my spotting scope) and said that he could see a vague shape like a satellite of some sort but couldn’t think of any satellite that would be flashing red and blue lights and moving that way. I have also pointed out the lights to my wife, and none of us have been unable to come up with an explanation for these lights that I see every clear night.  Whatever these objects are they are either small or very far away.  Any help would be appreciated. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Bright white ball of light south of Macon, Ga;2017-12-11 22:15:00;5-6 seconds;Bright white ball of light south of Macon, Ga On 12/11/2017 I was driving south on I-75 between mile markers 125 and 126 a little bit south of Macon, GA, at approximately 22:15 EST.  I caught movement out of my peripheral vision and looked out the passenger side of my windshield to see a bright ball of light hovering just above the tree line.  As I watched the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I got goosebumps up and down my arms.  The ball was a very bright white light and looked to be about 50-75 yards away.  It hovered over the trees for a couple of seconds and made a rapid (1-2 seconds) vertical decent into the trees.  It didn’t flicker behind the trees but kept the same brightness and solid ball shape.  It looked to be between the size of a golf ball and a small tangerine at that distance.;32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672
