Could have hit this one too.;1989-06-02 21:00:00;a few minutes;Could have hit this one too. A rare occurance of the aurora borealis (?) occured in the deep south that summer, and I thought I'd go out with my camera and try to take pictures. As the night wore on it was evident nothing was going to happen. I thought I saw a small private plane in the distance approaching, so I turned up my camera and set it on bulb, hoping the passing plane and its lights would cause a streak on the film.... anyway, as the craft approached, it was evident that it was flying very low and very slow. When the damn thing passed me overhead... about 60 feet in the air, it wasn't a plane at all, but a rectangular craft about 20 feet wide and about 50 feet long with a series of lights on the bottom lit up in no particular pattern. By the time I arranged my camera it was out of range. I snapped pictures but nothing came out. The craft was totally silent. I contacted the Air Force in nearby Warner Robbins and the tower told me they had no activity on their radar at the time I reported it. I feel especially lucky to have seen not only this craft close up, but another when I was quite young. I would like to experience regressive hypnotherapy to re-live the events and determine if other details are missing. These were not teeny lights in the sky, I could have hit either of these crafts with a well thrown rock. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672
