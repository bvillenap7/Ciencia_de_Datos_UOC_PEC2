Squared, flying vessel over Macon, GA;2011-08-30 21:30:00;3 minutes;Squared, flying vessel over Macon, GA My friend and I were coming home from the store going down Fulton Mill Road in Macon, GA when I looked out my passenger window because lights caught my eye. I looked up and I said to my friend, What the hell is that!?  She said,  That's just an airplane. I said, That don't look like an airplane.   As I'm saying this I'm hitting my brakes in my car and trying to watch the road while watching the flying object.  About this time I see a car coming from the other direction.  They hit the breaks and slowed way down as if they were looking at something as well. About that time I pull off a side road to watch it further and my friend yells THATS NOT AN AIRPLANE!   At this time, my friend and I both watched this flying object (which at this point didn't seem to be getting any further away from us) do a complete 90 degree turn to the right off of the path it was flying.  Another characteristic we noticed is that it was squared off in shape and had an arrange! ment of lights at each corner of the square and was noticed by both of us to be moving in an odd way like rolling or tumbling as it flew.  Also, when it did it's 90 degree turn, we both realized at that moment that there was no possible way that what we were seeing is an airplane, helicopter or anything else of that matter.  It literally scared both of us and sent me home in tears. It was overwhelming.;32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672
Rectangular craft with mostly blue, some red and white brilliant moving flashing lights, and hovered high in the sky north of Macon GA;2012-01-19 19:00:00;About 1Hr;rectangular craft with mostly blue, some red and white brilliant moving flashing lights, and hovered high in the sky north of Macon GA UFO SIGHTING: JANUARY 19, 2012    I am writing to report what I would describe as a UFO sighting.  This occurred on the evening of Thursday, January 19, 2012 at around 7:00PM EST, and lasting for about an hour.  This took place about 10 miles north of Macon, GA.  I would estimate the angle at which I viewed this object relative to the Earths’ surface was about 35 degrees.  As seen at arms’ length, I would say that it appeared to be about 1 ½ to 2 inches across and about ¼ inches high.  It was a straight, horizontal rectangle.  I saw nothing above or below this shape.  Its size as compared to the full moon would be about 1/16. It was seen in the SW sky, and was hovering completely still in mid-air.  What made it so outstanding were the colorful lights moving along constantly from left to right.  The colors were vivid blue, less green, less red and white.  They were intermittently blinking on and off as they moved along.  Then suddenly, all of the lights would momentarily go off.  Then all at once they became a solid line of bright white light with some brilliant flashes of that bright white light.  Then the colored lights started moving along again.  There appeared to be no repeat pattern.  I reasoned that, even though I couldn’t see it, the lights were probably circling around something and I could see only one section.  As the stars moved in a clockwise direction, this “object” very slowly sank to the right (westerly) until it was out of sight.  At any rate, it was the most fascinating thing I have ever witnessed in my life;32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672
