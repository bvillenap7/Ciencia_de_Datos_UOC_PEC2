eight bird shaped objects flying in a figure eight pattern;2000-06-01 15:00:00;5-10 min;eight bird shaped objects flying in a figure eight pattern I was standing in my mothers yard and I had a feeling to look up. And high above me, altitude unknown, were eight craft shaped like birds (no wings flapping) flying in a figure eight pattern, and after a minute or so they would break from the pattern in a single file and form another figure eight pattern.  There was no noise no near collision.  I was really dumb founded. I remember I kept thinking those aren't birds and that was to dangerous for air acrobatics.  I watched until my eyes hurt and then sometime they just disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

It was two golden dashes with a white dot in between.  It looked like morse code for K.  About the half the width of a full moon.  Appeared to be very high up and far away.  The lights did not blink.  It did not look like it was moving. I could only look for a few seconds at a time.   Once I was on I-16, I no longer had a view of it.;32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672
