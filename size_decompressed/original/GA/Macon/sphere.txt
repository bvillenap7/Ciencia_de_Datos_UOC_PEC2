Sphere shaped object hovering within the clouds.;2014-07-06 01:00:00;45 minutes;Sphere shaped object hovering within the clouds. I was sitting on my front porch talking on my cellphone with my best friend. I told him to go on his front porch as well to look at the moon and the clouds. The sky clouded the stars at first because of the brightness of the moon. Then, I noticed a bright light with colorful lights.  Sphere shaped at a distance in the sky But I could see plainly the color of the lights.  The sphere shaped object was hovering to the right side of the moon, another object was to the left side as if it was overseeing the larger sphere shaped object.  The colors blinking were red, white & a faint orange.   This lasted about 45 minutes.   I got a pic of the moon but the sphere shaped objects I took but want to zoom in for a closer look ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides no contact information.

Pulsating white light, forming a perfect circle of smaller light when it pulsed.;2014-10-17 06:15:00;2 minutes;Pulsating white light, forming a perfect circle of smaller light when it pulsed. Bright pulsing light high above RT 75  Macon, GA.   Every time it would pulsate, a ring of little white objects would appear around it.  I would say it pulsed every 10 seconds.  As i got closer it disappeared behind the tree line but i could still the light pulsing..  Then i lost it.;32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672

Driving north on I-75 between Bass rd exit and Rumble Rd exit in Bibb County-I along with both of my sons spotted something in sky that appeared at first to be a shooting star-however realized it was right upon us, about 50 to 100 ft above the tree line.   Color changed from blue to green (glowing) as it slightly paused and then shot downward disappearing behind the trees.;32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672
