I live near the Bibb/Jones county line on Hwy.49. I drove from Gray to my home,and at about 9pm Itook my telescope out set it to check out the light. Object was traveling directly from east to west. Viewing the object through my scope it looked round and very bright. It seemed to move around and roll back and forth. It looked like it had lines on about two thirds of the right side surface. On the left side was a port or a crater looking thing. One large and one small.;32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672
