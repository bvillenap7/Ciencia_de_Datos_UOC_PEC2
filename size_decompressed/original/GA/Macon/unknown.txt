Early 1977 at the GA Acad. for the Blind in Macon.  I heard a trumpet fanfare.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible abduction.  PD));1977-03-15 05:30:00;30 seconds;place in early 1977 at the Georgia Academy for the Blind in Macon.  It was a residential school for the blind back then, and there were four students per room. On this particular day, I awoke sometime between five and six in the morning, and as was so often the case, I simply decided to lie there until it was time for our house parent to awaken us at 6:30.   All of a sudden I heard from across the room what I can only describe as a sort of trumpet fanfare.  It came from high on the wall.  I’m guessing there was only a second between the fanfare and the startling thing that happened next.  I heard my dear, sweet friend suddenly emerge from the exact place where the music came from.  It sounded to me as though he simply came through the wall, and he was sobbing as he was turned over in mid-air and then dropped on his bed.  He cried for a few more seconds before he went to sleep.   I can assure you I did not go back to sleep.  I can also say that the boy who slept in the bed next to mine had also been wide awake, and he heard the sound of a brass fanfare too.  I know he did, because I overheard him later that day humming under his breath the exact notes that had come from high on the wall.   I never did ask my dear, sweet friend what happened to him.  After all we were only seven years old at the time.   The following school year I heard that he had moved to another state, so I never got the chance to ask him about this terrifying experience.  Who in the world (or from another world) would have taken my friend out of his bed in the middle of the night, and where did they take him.  Whatever they did to him made him sob, and whoever brought him back just dropped him on his stomach on the bed.   I would gladly answer any further questions you might have about this most unsettling experience from early 1977. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Thanks so much, Peter, for getting back in touch with me as quickly as you did.   I have been carrying around this story inside my head for forty years, all the while wondering who would believe such a thing.  The person who overheard the sound of the brass fanfare and who rehearsed it perfectly later that day is name ((name deleted)).  He presently lives in Atlanta.  In a phone conversation seven years ago, I asked him if he any recollection of the incident.  Alas, he had no memory of the experience.   The primary person in the story is named ((name #2 deleted)), and I wouldn't even begin to know how to contact him.  It seems as though his father was in one of the branches of the U.S. military, and was connected in some way to the State of Alaska.  I did not report the incident to anyone at the Academy For The Blind, and as far as I know, ((name #1 deleted)) didn't report it either.    In all your years of gathering and sorting through U.F.O. stories, have you ever heard anything like what happened to ((name #2 deleted)) in March of 1977?   Most curious of all in some respects was the brass fanfare ((name #1 deleted)) and I heard just before ((name #2 deleted)) materialized in mid-air.  What occurs to me now even as I type this is the possible link between ((name #2 deleted)) having been abducted, and his father's serving in the military.   Blessings to you, Rev. ((name deleted))  ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Hey, Peter,   In whatever way my story might be helpful to the U.F.O. community, my heart would be gladdened by it.  Of course, let me know if there is anything else I might contribute to the burgeoning literature on abductions.   One question for you, (and it's probably one you get all the time), will I ever know what happened to ((name deleted--abductee)) that morning?  What was it I heard back in 1977?

Two lights flashing back and forth, moving in unison across the sky. No visible solid object could be seen between them.;2008-07-17 23:00:00;2 mins.;Two lights flashing back and forth, moving in unison across the sky. No visible solid object could be seen between them. Saw two reddish-white lights about 30deg. above horizon moving together in the same direction, from south to north. The lights were flashing in an alternating pattern in rhythm back and forth, one in the front then one in the back, in the direction of movement. The distance between the lights, well over the length of a football field, suggest the aircraft was close by, but was unable to see the body of craft due to ground lights and there were no sounds of planes nearby. There were no other lights in the vicinity of the object besides the two flashing back and forth in unison. At first I thought the flashing lights were from extremely tall transmitter towers halfway across town, but since they were moving slowly from south to north in unison it couldn't have been those.;32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672
UFO sighting in Ga. 20 - 30 miles outside of Macon on I-16 around 10:00 P.M. Aug 15, 2011;2011-08-15 22:00:00;10.00 min;UFO sighting in Ga. 20 - 30 miles outside of Macon on I-16 around 10:00 P.M. Aug 15, 2011 On the evening of August 15, 2011, my girlfriend and I were headed back to Dublin, Ga. from Macon, Ga. on I-16 when we spotted an object in standstill high in the sky.  The object was far away at first but we could tell it wasn’t moving. It was entirely too high to be a cell phone tower or radio transmission tower.  As we kept getting closer we could see the lights underneath, three of them-shaped in a triangular form with a dim, red flashing light.  The UFO then moved south about two miles. We were heading east so it moved from our left to our right and stayed there in that position hovering high in the sky.  That was the last I saw of the unidentified flying object.  I will be happy to go into more detail but would like to hear that someone else saw the same thing, first.;32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672
