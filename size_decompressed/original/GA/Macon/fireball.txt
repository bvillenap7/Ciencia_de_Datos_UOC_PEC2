Fireball object that looked like exploded above ground about power line height continued going down road.;2011-10-06 20:35:00;10-15 seconds;Fireball object that looked like exploded above ground about power line height continued going down road. At approximately 8:30 tonight 10/6/11 I was in my truck heading southwest on HWY 49 (Houston Road) in South Bibb Co. of Macon Georgia.  I had just passed  a Subdivision on my left which was just past  the intersection of Houston road which was on my left and Sardis Church Road on my right.  Then a car was coming toward me on my left (at this area there is a large open field on my left). I noticed what at first I thought was a falling star then I realized it was much larger maybe 2’ to 3’ in diameter, about 150 yards away.  It had colors flowing from it like a falling star.  They were red, yellow, blue, and orange flowing from around it and from behind it.  It was coming down toward the ground at about a 45 degree angle. When it was just below tree tops and just above power lines it looked like it exploded as if it had hit the ground with all kinds of colors coming from it.  Then it looked like it continued going down the road in the  direction I was going staying below the tree line and just above power lines.  It had more of a yellowish/white light coming out from behind it at this time and was going about the speed you would think of a falling star.   It made a slight turn and went out of sight which was about direction road made at that point.  It was all over in seconds.;32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672

These lights went in 3 different directions going really fast, leaving 3 vapor trails behind them.  It was something I never seen before.  There was no noise at all.;32.8521766550522;-83.6908452961672
