2 White flashing lights moving across the sky over Fayetteville, Ga.;2007-06-22 22:00:00;15 seconds;2 White flashing lights moving across the sky over Fayetteville, Ga I am in shock at what I saw last night. Ok, I was laying on the golf course with 2 friends and one of them turned to me and said what is that? I looked up and there were 2 flashing white lights moving parallel to eachother. One light would flash for a half of a second as thenother turned off for a half of a second. I know for a fact that it was not an airplane because there was no noise and I could not see the object between the lights (if there was one). They were moving about 2 times the speed of an average airplane would move in the sky. They seemed about the same altitude that an airplane would travel. I am still in shock of what happened and i cannot get it out of my mind. Can some one give me some clarification on what exactly this could have been.;33.4214056338028;-84.4754126760563
Huge Blue/Green Orb over Fayetteville GA, decended straight down;2009-10-20 21:00:00;10 seconds;Huge Blue/Green Orb over Fayetteville GA, decended straight down Tonight, October 20, 2009 at 9:00 p.m. I was driving east on Hwy 54 from Peachtree City to Fayetteville. GA.   As I was passing Fayette Piedmont Hospital, I saw a large pulsing orb -  blue/green (turquoise) - high in the sky out my driver's side window.   It was hovering in the sky, then it became very bright (still blue/green) and decended straight down - vertically - and dropped below the tree line.  This was not a shooting star - there was no trail and it did not shoot across the sky. It decended straight down vertically like an elevator. The light (orb) appeared to be larger than any plane, helicopter or star I've ever seen in the sky at night.;33.4214056338028;-84.4754126760563
Five bright white lights moving E to W at constant speed and altitude with no similarities to aircraft.;2013-09-14 22:45:00;~5 minutes;Five bright white lights moving E to W at constant speed and altitude with no similarities to aircraft. On 14 Sep, 2013, at 2245, I observed a total of five bright lights moving across the sky. Initially there was one light observed moving E to W approximately 70 degrees above the northern horizon.  The brightness of the light was between my observations of the ISS and Venus.  There was no sound or any additional lights one would expect from a passing aircraft. As I was taking video of this object with my IPhone, a friend who was also observing this lighted object said toward the eastern horizon there were four more moving in the same direction and the same speed.  They also came across the sky at the same elevation as the first and the final two were closer together, only 3-5 degrees apart.  I also recorded these objects on my IPhone. The brightness of the objects maintained their intensity as they passed by but slowly became dimmer as they continued to the West until they could no longer be viewed.  It was almost as if they were satellites reflecting the light of the sun, but that would have required a significant altitude based on the sun setting nearly 2 1/2 hours before the sighting. I flew in the Air Force for 21 years and with a commercial carrier for 15 years and can say I've never seen anything similar to this observation of these objects.  I consulted with a member of the FAA TRACON in the area and after pulling the radar history for the period of observation, he could find no activity to resemble the IPhone video he viewed.. I am at a loss as to what I saw and wanted to pass this information along to see if anyone else observed something similar on the noted day and time..;33.4214056338028;-84.4754126760563
