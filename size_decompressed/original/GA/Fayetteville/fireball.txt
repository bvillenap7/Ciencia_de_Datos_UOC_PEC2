Too erratic to be a normal action.;2013-05-28 20:45:00;15 minutes;Too erractic to be a normal action. At approximately 8:45 pm an early star looking shape object appeared in the southern sky. The object seem to move in a south west diagonal direction.  The object moved faster than a celestial object ( star ) but slower than a aircraft or weather balloon.  The rising and stationary position seemed like it could be a weather balloon until it retracted to its mid way point.  The object faded as if someone was covering the object with a blanket fading in and out very fast.  At 9:05pm the object disappeared.   At approximately 9:45pm the same general direction we saw a sharp and bright light turn on with a 15 second delay of a second time. This may simply be a weather balloon phenomena but in case its not just wanted to mention it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
