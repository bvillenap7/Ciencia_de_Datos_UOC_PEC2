While enjoying the pre storm calm outside with my dog, I watched as what I believe was a ufo, flying above me. He was acting strangely, and so I figured we would just let the rain start, then go inside. As I was appreciating the beauty of the leaves at the top of the trees, I noticed what I originally thought was a drone, sitting right between the trees.   I then realized, that the object was round, like oval but squished, and much farther away but larger.  I watched as it glide through the treetop line view, in what seemed to be a perfectly still and straight line. As soon as the object was out of view, the first thunder clap rung out what seemed to be right about my head. Then the lighting and thunder commenced at a much more reasonable tone level. As the rain started coming down I realized that I didn’t pull my phone out. One thing that I know for sure, was that I saw this black metallic mass in the sky, approximately the size of a large suv, maybe 200 -250 feet up. I saw it very clearly, and watched it slowly move in a direct line away from me. This is the second clear sighting I’ve had here. The first was a few years ago and is a much more intense account. I’m hoping that these two are connected, but am left with nothing to go on besides vivid memories.;33.4214056338028;-84.4754126760563
