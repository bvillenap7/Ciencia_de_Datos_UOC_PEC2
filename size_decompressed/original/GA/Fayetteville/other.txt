Shapeshifting, yellow ufo seen in broad daylight over elementary and high school in Georgia;2019-03-25 07:40:00;10 seconds;Shapeshifting, yellow ufo seen in broad daylight over elementary and high school in Georgia. On Monday morning at 7:20 am, I dropped off my child to school.  I then left school, in my car, heading  towards home. At 7:40 am, while driving, l saw a yellow/light beige/dimmed white, wide V sign/open triangle v, with the point pointed towards me.  It changed shape from a wide V / open triangle, to 2 wide open V triangles, V /\ turning from an open V triangle, to a closed overlapping square &lt&gt continuing to change shape from a overlapping “square” to a closed diamond \//\&lt&gt. The UFO was in constant movement/ shifting shapes not radiating light, dimmed yellow in appearance. It was higher than full grown pinetrees that were in sight next to the ufo, on the right side (trees approximately 8 feet high). It was whatsoever not right next to the trees, but far away, high in the sky. It was a pretty blue sky day and the uap was approximately 1 mile visible to an Elementary School. I was driving while this was happening and only was able to capture about 2 seconds of the ufo on my cellphone video, where you can see a yellow spot behind pine trees, before it disappeared.  Not flying away or zooming away, but here one second gone the next.  It seemed more like a clocking, then disappearing. When I returned home, I had tried to reach out for someone to “investigate”, since it had been sooo close to an elementary and high school, but without success. Eventually I called 911 to report a ufo anonymous, but I am not aware of any additional sightings from others. During this sighting there were many cars behind me and the street was in open view to many others, at this busy Monday morning, school day. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.  PD));33.4214056338028;-84.4754126760563
