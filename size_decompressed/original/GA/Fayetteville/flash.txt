My wife and I both witness what we expected to be a shooting star to our left which would be north of Fayetteville toward the Atlanta Airport.  The travel distance of the object was much shorter arc than a shooting star and was much brighter than any I have ever witnessed.   The flash made was many times the size of any celestial object or airplane light, (flash made was approximately 1/5 the size of a half moon)  it appeared as a large flash that moved a short distance and disappeared.  It ddi not appear to be very high above the ground, slightly higher than a landing plane.  It happened at 20:18 according to my vehicle clock.
