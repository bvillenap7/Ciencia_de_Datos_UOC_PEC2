A quiet red ball flying overhead at moderate speed over North East Georgia;2011-10-06 20:55:00;2 minutes;A quiet red ball flying overhead at moderate speed over North East Georgia I first saw this flying object for the first time when my wife told me to look up as it was just overhead.  My first thought was it was a hot air balloon.  I thought I saw fire under it but it was too dark for a hot air balloon.   It was moving quickly as I got my cell phone out to take a picture of it.  I got one picture before it went into the trees.   It was larger than a star and was moving southwest.  It looked like it was on fire and streaking.   I watched it for a total of 2 minutes.  This sighting took place October 6, 2011 at 8:55 EST.;34.1794;-83.9016000000001
