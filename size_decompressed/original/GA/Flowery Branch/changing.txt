UFO in flowery branch;2020-09-14 06:00:00;Hours;UFO in flowery branch I was awaken by the sound of tussling in the woods in my back yard. I went outside to see some of the neighbors lights had turned on.  I look around and then look up to the sky to find an orangey object moving in sporadic patterns, zigging and zagging.  It was 6:45 when I ran upstairs to get my wife who groggily went out to see as well.  She witnessed and acknowledged the ufo and itâ€™s patterns.  She went back inside while I got my drone.  During flight of my drone, I lost intros of the device and all signal was lost and I lost the drone.  The drone I have is sophisticated with safe guards and intelligent capacities in place to avoid random signal disconnect, yet I was cut off from all signal.  Lucky for me,  I did manage to get some good footage and am able to zoom in the video.  The graphics are pretty wild.;34.1794;-83.9016000000001
