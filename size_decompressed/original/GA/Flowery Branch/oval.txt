Large red oval object flying over Hall County GA;2011-10-06 20:55:00;90 seconds;Large red oval object flying over Hall County GA I was taking my dog for a walk as my husband was unloading groceries when I noticed an odd looking glow through the trees in the back yard.  I kept looking to see if it was the moon or what it was that I thought I saw.  As I continued looking at the woods I saw it again.  It came straight at me overhead when I realized I had no idea what I was seeing. It was red that looked almost like it might have been on fire but there wasn’t a flame.   It was coming from the northeast moving southwest.  It was much larger than a bright star but not as big as the moon.  It was round to oval in shape maybe the size of a quarter of a full moon. I’m going to guess it was flying as high as jets but maybe higher and if it was higher than I was about 50% larger than a jet.  There were no blinking lights as you would see on an airplane, just solid bright red. I had a visual on it for a total time of 1-2 minutes.  As it was flying southwest after it passed overhead it appeared to almost stall for a several seconds then just started moving again and got went out of sight.  It passed over our house at around 160 degree angle.;34.1794;-83.9016000000001
