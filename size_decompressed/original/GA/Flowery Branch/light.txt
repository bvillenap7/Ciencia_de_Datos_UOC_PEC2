I KNOW THIS WASN'T A SATILITE AS IT. MOVED WAY TO QUICKLY. IT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY MAYBE TWO HAND LEGHNTS THEN STARTED TO DISTANCE IT'S SELF , TILL I COULD NO LONGER SEE IT. AGAIN THIS HAPPENED QUICKLY ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));34.1794;-83.9016000000001
Two objects over north GA emit strobes then moved away.;2009-08-22 22:00:00;30 Seconds;Two objects over north GA emit strobes then moved away. Conditions: Very clear night, no clouds, very little light pollution. Details: As I often do at night, I was sitting in the hot tub looking up (usually looking for satellites or meteors). I noticed a bright double strobe of light in the N-NW sky about 80 degress in altitude. I dismissed it as nothing but kept looking at the star in which it originated. It double-strobed again. About 2 seconds later, another object about 10 degrees away to the south appeared to give a reply double-strobe. Both objects were stationary and had a magnitude of about 2.0 when not flashing. Immediately, both objects started slowly moving toward the SE. The lights faded to dark within 10 seconds and I didn't see anything else. The amount of distance covered when both objects faded to dark were not consistent with normal satellites moving into the earth's shadow. This means that the object's light source was not created by the reflection of the sun at that altitude. I assume the altitude was very high since none of the stars in the direct path were eclipsed by the ! object. At the presumed altitude, the objects went from a standstill to the speed of an orbiting satellite in under a second. I have no other supporting information of this sighting nor were there other witness. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
