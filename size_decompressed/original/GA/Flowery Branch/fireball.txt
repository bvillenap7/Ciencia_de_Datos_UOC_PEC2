Great ball of FIRE.;2014-06-14 01:00:00;5 minutes;Great ball of FIRE. My fiancee and I were on the lake, fishing at on Lake Lanier.   He pointed at the sky, and we both witnessed a huge fire ball hover above the water about 60 feet in the air.   I was terrified and I jumped on the dock and hid.  He yelled, Baby what are you doing?  Come film this! I gathered my courage, and I have a video of it but its very faint.  Compared to my horrible camera lens, this thing was HUGE.   It began to slowly go out and then just disappeared.  We knew it was still there we just couldnt see it.   There was no noise, no smoke and no smell.  It looked like a giant flame of a flickering candle.;34.1794;-83.9016000000001

At first I thought it was just the sun reflecting off a cloud because it was early and I could see the sun rising as the moon was fading out.It was clear skies and the light seemed to keep rising above the cloud I had noticed it in and started to get longer to what then appeared to be a fire ball. I noticed as it kept going on an upward trend straight up that there were 2 fiery streaks that trailed behind the fireball object. I picked up my phone and started recording video because it was hard to make out and I zoomed in and was able to make out the fireball shape with the trails behind it. I recorded this for 1 min 29 seconds and put my phone down to use my bathroom inside my bedroom and when I came back to look the sky was very grey and cloudy and the object seemed to disappear. I live in an apartment complex and this was seen north ! off my bedroom balcony. I have attached a link to the video I recorded for further investigation and I also noticed after watching the video 44 to 45 seconds in I seen a small metal object to the top right of the fireball but that also disappeared in seconds of recording. I dod notice 3 to 4 planes in the area prior to the siting but am 100% sure this fiery object was not a plane. https://youtu.be/quGbxDNG-_s;34.1794;-83.9016000000001
