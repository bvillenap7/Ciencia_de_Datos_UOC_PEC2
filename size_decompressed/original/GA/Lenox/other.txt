 my daughter and I were looking at Venus when we both realized that there were hundreds of stars. ((Starlink satellites??));2020-04-02 21:00:00;>1 hour;We were standing outside and my daughter and I were looking at Venus when we both realized that there were hundreds of what we thought were stars at first but all of them were moving .We stood for over 30 minutes watching this. My Husband and hers were there and our 20 year old Son all watched this happen.  Some were close and some were further away but were moving closer in. They were forming lines and circles . Some would backtrack from the lines and rotate their direction.  There are still some in the sky as I'm typing this outside. Last night there was something that moved overhead and was huge but there was nothing seen other than the sound. It wasn't a sound of helicopter or jet or anything like that it had a very strange hum to it. The only other time that sound was heard was the night of the Wolf Blood Moon and we saw what appeared to be a triangle shaped craft with lights but it was like 5 football fields in size. And hovered then moved up and out a! nd disappeared quickly;31.2671;-83.4435
