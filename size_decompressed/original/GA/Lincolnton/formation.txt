6 flashing lights south of lincolnton in a perfect horizontal line before disappearing;2004-09-09 21:30:00;seconds;6 flashing lights south of lincolnton in a perfect horizontal line before disappearing On Thursday night, Sept. 9, 2004 I was sitting outside on my porch when a light in the sky caught my eye. When I looked up there were two flashes of light, almost like small balls of fire. Then immediately after I followed a horizontal line of lights. Each one perfectly horizontal with the one before and as soon as one light would go out there would be another light up. I've seen planes before and I'm sure this wasn't one. After 6 lights, they disappeared. The sighting was towards the south.;33.7773;-82.4435
