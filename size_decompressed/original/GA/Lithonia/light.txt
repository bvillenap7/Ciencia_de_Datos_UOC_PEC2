I was on I-20 near stonecrest mall when I noticed a bright green light streak across the sky. This object seem to go only a short distance before it disapeared. The first thing I thought of was a flare because of the size and brightness of the light. After that I thought it may have been a commet,but then I came to the conclusion it was nether because of its flight pattern. This object traveled a very short disstance horizonally in the sky. This object never made any noise that I heard. Soon after this happened I called my wife and told her what happenend. For something that took only a short time it really scared me and I will never forget it.;33.7101330434783;-84.1254834782608
Satellite performing a sharp 90 degree turn.;2006-11-15 05:00:00;3 minutes;Satellite performing a sharp 90 degree turn. One night Late 2005 early 2006 I had gone outside my place of employment to a small field next to the building Weyerhaeuser container plant Lithonia Georgia and being an amateur astronomer looked up into the night sky to look at the constellations and frequent satellite passing by.   It was about an hour before the sky started becoming light and I would frequently see satellites passing overhead and would watch them for a few minutes, this particular morning I saw a satellite going from south to north it was of good visability reasonably bright 0-1st magnatude simular in appearence to Saturn, making no sound, a fter observing it for 30 seconds or so the light made a sharp 90 degree turn, no apparent radius, no change in speed, to the east,  I continued to observe the light till it went out of sight.
