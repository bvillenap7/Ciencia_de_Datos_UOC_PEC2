Orange glowing ball;2007-04-02 13:00:00;2 mins;Orange glowing ball Hovering over woods deep in the back of mothers home was an orange ball.  Reminds me of a basket ball in shape not very, very bright like a light but more of an internal orange glow.  Did not bounce or move at all just seems like someone placed it in the sky like a picture.  Got out of my car in the subdivison with mouth open and just stared.  There was a person who pulled up along side of me also staring.  He ask me do I see that!  I asked him does he see it!  Very strange first and only experience! Proceeded to mothers house to see if she was o.k.  Woke her up to see if she heard or saw anything.  Went back outside and walked up the street to turn and see if it was still there.  It was not!
