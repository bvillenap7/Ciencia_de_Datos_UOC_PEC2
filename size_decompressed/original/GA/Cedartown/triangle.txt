It was like a falling star, but it was moving fairly slow. Then it just stopped, and in no more than 30 seconds it was right above the car. It was definitely no airplane. It had 3 lights, and you could plainly see that it was triangle shape. It seemed to have a blinking red light either in the middle, or on the back of it?
