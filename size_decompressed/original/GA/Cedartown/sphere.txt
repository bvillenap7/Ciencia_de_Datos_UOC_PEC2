At first it seemed to be in place therefore I assumed it was just a bright star.  Then it started moving through the sky to my life.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me but we were at a red light and we knew it was moving when it glided out of sight when a building obstructed our view.   We then drove around the building and witnessed it eventually came to a complete stop.  As we watched it for another minute or so we saw it now not only move to the left or right.  But change direction and climb upward into the sky and slightly to the right.  Then it came to another stop and moved left yet again.   The light was too large and bright to be a controlled drone.  It moved therefore it wasn't a star.  And when it moved it changed direction multiple times and almost seemed to float therefore to the best of my knowledge it was no plane or small meteor.   Lastly, we had to drive out of sight as the cars behind us became impatient and that was the last we saw of it.;34.0114000000001;-85.2471000000002
