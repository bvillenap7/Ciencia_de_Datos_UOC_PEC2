Object above tree in Port Wentworth , Ga;1980-06-01 20:30:00;20 mimutes;Object above tree in Port Wentworth , Ga When I was about 9 years old my mom, my brother and I were walking to my mom’s friend’s hose to visit and when we got there above the big tree in her yard was a cigar shaped object. it was covered in multicolored lights. The best way to describe the lights would be to think of a Christmas tree. It just sat there hovering above the tree. No sound and no movement. My mother called her friend and her son out to see it. There were a total of five of us that saw it.  The friend called and reported it. We were told that it was an airplane. Yeah right!!!! I have never before or after seen an airplane to look like that!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));32.1539;-81.1534
