I was proceeding from I 95 to work at Gulfstream aerospace down back road from Savannah international airport, when I saw what I first thought was an aircraft in landing approach.  Object was about the size of a Large fighter jet or small executive jet such as a learjet. The craft was of a shiny polished mettalic appearance it was travelling at a much higher than normal speed for a landing aircraft (est 400-500mph.) Altitude appeared to be about 800 to 1000 feet.coming from due north, . the craft overflew the north south runway of the airport then made a sharp left turn and went out of sight heading east towards Savannah Ga.Ther was no engine noise, no visible exhaust, no propellers. Seen from the side the craft appeared to have short stubby wings or none at all. the fuselage was more rounded or domed than normal aircraft, although It did not appear to have the classic saucer shape. I Have worked at Gulfstream aerospace and have seen a wide variety of aircraft landing and taking off at Savannah Intenational, and have never seen an aircraft of this type before.;32.1539;-81.1534
