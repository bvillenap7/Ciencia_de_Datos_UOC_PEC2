Stars in Broad Daylight;2002-05-15 16:00:00;15 Minutes;Stars in Broad Daylight On May 15, 2002 my wife and I saw something strange in the skies above Morrow, Georgia.  4:00 in the afternoon, we saw what I thought at first was a bright star.  Since it is very strange to see a star in broad daylight we watched at it.  Then we realized there were about 50-100 dim pinpoints (stars) of light.  They seemed to be partially behind a gray haze (cloud) and some of them kept fading in and out behind the haze. I think the objects were producing the haze as a camouflage.  The brightest object was in the rear of the pack. The only clouds in the sky were on the horizon and the objects seemed to be headed in a SE direction at a steady speed. I couldn't guess at an altitude but, we are near a large airport and these points of light were much higher in the sky compared to the planes.  We watched them for 10-15 minutes.  I was a little freaked out by what we saw and did not ask other people around me to look at it which I now regret. I have not heard or read anything about it since.  Has anyone else reported anything like this to you? I took photos with a digital camera but nothing turned out. Only a couple of blurry Spots. Thanks ((name deleted));33.5844;-84.3206
