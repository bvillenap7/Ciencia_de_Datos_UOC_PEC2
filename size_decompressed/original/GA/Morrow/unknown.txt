My family and I saw a strange looking craft, not sure of what type, while unloading supplies at office I work for. It had three blinking red lights and it appeared to hover in spots and then zig zag about the sky eventually diving like behind a group of trees. In a few seconds it appeared again off in the distance at an even lower altitude. At the same time another craft like, maybe a plane with a very bright light and what seemed to be  two red flashing lights appeared behind the same group of trees and just seemed to hover there in the air! I have never in my 36 years ever seen a plane with three flashing, not blinking,rather large lights like these!!!      Also for the past 8 or 9 months we have observed a passenger type aircraft with a extremly bright ,huge, double headlight that can also hover in one place for any amount of time. It also can turn on a dime! It doesn't have to make a large turn like a regular plane. My husband and I have watched it for periods of 20-30 mins.It is strange to watch. At first we noticed it only after 11:00p.m.(I work at night alot).   Now we have recently seen it as early as 7-8p.m. and in different areas around where we live.Do you think it could be some new type of craft that the govt/army might be testing? We do have an Army base nearby. If anyone knows we would like to be informed. I don't think is really an UFO! It is however something new we have never seen in the skies over middle Georgia!!!!!!
