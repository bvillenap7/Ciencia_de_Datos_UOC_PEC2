Very beautiful light on ufo that was giant;2009-01-13 20:25:00;3 minutes;Very beautiful light on ufo that was giant I was working at my cafe and around 8:25 pm i was outside taking a break when i saw the ufo in the sky. I then called my son outside to show him what i saw.  It lasted around 3 minutes. It was giant in size and had multi colored lights that traveled around the spaceship.  It was quiet and made no sound. It traveled from the sight that i saw it tothe next sight that was probably 10 miles away in the blink of an eye.  This is the secong sighting i've seen in the same location.  The first sightingwa about 8 years ago. This was amazing as i felt paralized. Very beautiful and breath taking.;31.2137396825397;-81.5157365079366
Round object, Bright amber color moving silently at high speed with fluid like motions.;2021-03-23 21:00:00;15 seconds;Round object, Bright amber color moving silently at high speed with fluid like motions. Walked into my backyard. Just happened to look up. WOW! Object at around 4000'-5000'. Bright high amber color. Round. Moving at high speed from the SW to the NE at 600 to 800 mph. Object deviated at least 5 times from the SW/NE straight line trajectory. Meaning that it moved to the right in a convex curve. Then returned to the straight line trajectory. And then moved into a left convex curve and returned to a straight heading. The motion was erratic yet seamless. It never lost speed while deviating from it's path. It was a fluid like motion. Absolutely no sound before the object came into my view . No sound while viewing it. And no sound after I lost sight of it.;31.2137396825397;-81.5157365079366
