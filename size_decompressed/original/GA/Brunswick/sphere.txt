Sphere/oval lighted object traveling slow making no sound to the south no lights on object.;2005-02-11 06:28:00;25sec;Sphere/oval lighted object traveling slow making no sound to the south no lights on object. Iwas out on my back porch and turn to my right and saw this object oval sphere in shape.  It was 200 to 300ft above the pinetrees heading south at speed of a single engine craft.  The object was lighted at about a 75watt lightbulb.  The object made no sound.  I followed the object as far as could and just before it went out of site it appeared to be two off set spheres.;31.2137396825397;-81.5157365079366
