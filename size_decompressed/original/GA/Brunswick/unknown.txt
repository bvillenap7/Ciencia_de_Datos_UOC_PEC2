One evening, relatives were leaving our home & my parents walked them outside & I was alone in the living room watching TV when I looked toward the hall way & saw someone's head looking around the corner at me.  The head is like an upside down tear drop shape, the eyes are big, maybe slightly slanted, dark & round shape.  And then it was gone.  I never heard a sound & don't know what caused me to look up to begin with.  I actually got up from the chair & slowly walked down the hall way checking each room.  At the end of the hall way is my parents room which I also checked.  In my parents room there is a back door opening up to the back yard & this door is always locked & hard to open.  The door was unlocked but shut but I opened the door & looked out side for a moment but didn't see anything. I closed the door & locked it & never told anyone about what I saw.  When I try to think back on that night I can't really remember the day, time or year. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
