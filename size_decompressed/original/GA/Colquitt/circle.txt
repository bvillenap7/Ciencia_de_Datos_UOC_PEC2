It was between 1:00a.m and 1:30 a.m.  Before bed I went to take our dog out to potty automatically upon opening the door I noticed something far off that felt out of place and unusual.  At first glance it looked like a bright star until i noticed it was moving.  I looked closer and seen 3 colors of lights.  Blue white and red, the red was flashing.  It looked as if it was vibrating moving in a unpredictable pattern but confined.   I went and woke up my husband to make sure i wasn't seeing things and he thought it was a tower. Iv lived in this area for 15 years and know where all the towers are.  It's not hard to spot something out of place if you live 20 min away from any town in the middle of fields.   We just checked now to see if it's there again and there is nothing in that spot.   I thought it could have been a drone.   I don't know how long it stayed because I went to bed.;31.1664;-84.7267
