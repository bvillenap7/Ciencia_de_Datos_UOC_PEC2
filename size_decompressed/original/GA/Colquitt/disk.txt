Giant Light With Dish Shaped Object Above It;2008-01-25 22:00:00;10 mins;Giant Light With Dish Shaped Object Above It The other night I was heading to see my parents from a friends house. I was traveling in the county on Whitesbridge rd. When just so I desided to take a glance at a field on my left. When I looked I noticed a huge bright ball shaped white-blueish colored light above some trees it was like nothing I ever saw. It lite up the whole sky. I stopped to get a closer look and when I did I noticed right above the light was an large dish shaped object.I could not tell the color of the disk just the outline of it. It had to be about an acre long. On the dish there was many different lights all shaped like circles and flashing. The color of those lights were red,blue, and green. The ship just seem to sit there.Then all of a sudden all I saw was a bright flash of light zoom across the field before and their was a loud humming noise as it left. This is not the first time this has been seen. I have encouraged other people to report their sighting.;31.1664;-84.7267
