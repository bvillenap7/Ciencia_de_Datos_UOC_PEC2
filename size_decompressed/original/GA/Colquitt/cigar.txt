I Officer Lawson was doing security checks at our local industrial park and notice alight in the sky.   I stop my patrol vehicle and saw a light in the Northwest sky and it was stationary at first and when I cut my head lights off and started to get out of the vehicle a smaller object appeared under it  looked a lot alike after burners on a fighter jet but there was no noise the larger object started moving Southeast and as it pass there was no noise and i saw two large lights one behind another the other object went under the bigger one and straight up.   I watch the smaller object dance around and even saw a what looked like a passenger jet. the object was stationary until the jet got close and then it started to dance around again  and stopped after the jet went under and by it.   Then I started climbing until in looked like a star.;31.1664;-84.7267
