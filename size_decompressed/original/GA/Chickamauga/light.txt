I first saw Blinky close to a jet aircraft contrail on 8-16-00 at about 2015. Blinky then ascended straight up out of sight. The following evening, he returned at approximately the same time. Blinky first appears to look like a star, and as descends he gets brighter, hovers for a few seconds, then ascends almost straight up and dims out. On some occasions, 3 times over the last 2 weeks, Blinky hovers over what appears to be a cell phone tower in the western sky. Then slowly leaves over Lookout Mountain, to the west. On 8-18-00, after Blinky made his appearance, we had a very strange lightening storm. No rain, no wind, no thunder, just constant flashes over about an hour, coming from one small cloud in the southern sky. This included ball lightening. Looked like a fireworks show coming from this one small cloud that remained motionless. We nicknamed him Blinky before we found out he already has the nickname Bubba. He is real regular, always on time, and does pretty much the same maneuvers. He looks just like the videos of Bubba that are on SkyNet. Haven't seen Blinky now in 3 days. ((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the witnesses are observing.  Our first guess would be that the object is a celestial body, but they do not move in the manner described.  We doubt whether the object is related to the storm activity cited, but that is a presumption.  UFO's generally do not appear in one area so frequently that they are given names by the locals.
