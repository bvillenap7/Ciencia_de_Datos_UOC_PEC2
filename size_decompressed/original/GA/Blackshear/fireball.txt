Big glow of neon green falling from the sky;2007-01-05 18:00:00;10 seconds;Big glow of neon green falling from the sky. My son and I were leaving his house one night after dark headed to my house.  We were stopped at a stop sign.    Facing us across the road on the left was some land that had not been cleared.  Probably about 5 acres with nothing but trees.  All of a sudden we both see a big glowing ball of neon green falling really fast from the sky.  It was huge, kind of round,  white on the inside, with the glow of neon green on the outer side.   We watched it keep falling until it looked like it landed in that field of trees. Then we saw nothing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Saw what appeared to be a meteor in night sky.;2015-10-12 23:12:00;5 seconds;Saw what appeared to be a meteor in night sky. Monday, Oct 12th 2015, I saw what appeared to be a beautiful meteor fly through the sky.  I was at a local track stargazing at around 11:12 PM when this happened.  It was a large fiery ball with a trail of light that flew nearly directly over me and disappeared behind trees to my right.  It was beautiful.  But no one else in my area has seemed to have witnessed it.  It seemed to be very close to earth, or either it was very large. It wasn't your average shooting star. It appeared to be well within our atmosphere.;31.2912;-82.2654
Dimming sequence of orange lights migrating across the sky.;2017-05-09 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Dimming sequence of orange lights migrating across the sky. A fire like sphere slowly appeared in the sky above the tree line 2-4 miles away.  It held its position steady, then faded out as another faded into light just above to its right.   The second object did the same as the first and at that moment another appeared to the right.  This dimming Christmas light type pattern stopped entirely, then reappeared two more times.  They all migrated to the north.   3 separate formations at 3-4 lights each formation.  None of them seemed to move at all.  All the same orange fire like dimming glow.;31.2912;-82.2654
