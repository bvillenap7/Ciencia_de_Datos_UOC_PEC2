Flashing light moving erratically.;2015-01-03 20:15:00;5 minutes;flashing light moving erratically Around 8:15 PM, more or less, on January 3, 2015, we noticed a white flashing light, like a strobe light in the night sky over Blackshear, Georgia.  The light had a star-like appearance.  The light seemed to move erratically, in small jumps with components perpendicular to the direction of general motion, which was north to south.  It almost seemed as if the flashes were confined to a small area around the apparent center of motion.   The flashes got to about 25 degrees above the SSE horizon, and then swung back towards a generally northerly direction, moving with the same erratic motion.  When the flashes got to the northern part of the sky, the apparent source suddenly accelerated and disappeared in a northerly direction.;31.2912;-82.2654
