unusual clould path in barrow county georgia;2010-06-20 22:00:00;0;unusual clould path in barrow county georgia I was working in my garage the night of June 20th and my wife came out after putting my son to bed. It was between 10 and 10:30. I decided to take a break and sit outside on the picnic bench in our front yard. The moon was out and what caught my attention was the huge gap/line in the cloulds. This was not ordinary because because of it's size. It would have had to be a jet liner flying at about 1200 feet to leave mark of this size. The cloulds that I saw were atleast a mile or two high. The impression that was left had clean edges on the clould and a center line was sort of how a boat motor may leave a line trailing behing.;33.9978;-83.7124000000001
