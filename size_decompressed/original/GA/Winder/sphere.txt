Stationary light suddenly speeds off silently into the horizon.;2017-10-15 20:00:00;4 minutes;Stationary light suddenly speeds off silently into the horizon. Object was seen at dusk.  Not sure of the exact clock time. Facing east. Looked like a very large bright star. Stayed in one spot for about 4 minutes. Began to move away slowly from left to right horizontally. Then picked up speed rapidly and and began to climb upward in a slight ark. It went from being at a one o clock position on the horizon to being out of sight at the right side of the horizon in about 1 second. There was no sound. It definitely moved faster than a human could survive.  Not sure if this is related, but, the next day, during the day, it was cloudless. In the same relative spot from my vantage point, small single clouds would form only one at a time and then disappear in less than 30 seconds or less.  This was the only cloud formation in the sky.  Very small clouds from my vantage point.  Never saw anything like that before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));33.9978;-83.7124000000001
