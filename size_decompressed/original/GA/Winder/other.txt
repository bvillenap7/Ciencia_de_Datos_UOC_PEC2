On Jan.11, I saw at first 6 objects flying in an oblong formation similar to geese.  The objects were football or catâ€™s eye shaped, orange in color, and they were solid instead of blinking.   I observed the objects flying erratically for approximately a quarter mile.  I saw the first 6 objects for about 15 seconds.   After the 15 seconds, I witnessed another of the same object flying towards the first 6 and then joining them.  The 7th object flew towards the center of the first 6, and then all 7 objects disappeared. In total what I witnessed last about 30 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be exceptionally objective and eloquent, in his description of the event.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.
