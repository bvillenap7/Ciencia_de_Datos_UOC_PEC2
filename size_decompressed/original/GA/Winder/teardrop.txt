When I stepped outside my deck to look around,I saw from a distance, a small light in the sky.At first I thought it was a star. I was admiring it because it was so bright. Then it started to move very slowly in a strange way. This lasted for 10 minutes and caused all the dogs to howl.I was very nervous and spooked. I ran back inside and turned all the lights off. I kept my eyes on the object until I could not see it anymore..It was not a plane .It moved way to slow and strange and it did not even make a sound..
