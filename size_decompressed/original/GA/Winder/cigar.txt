Cigar shaped object with bright light zigzagging above Winder Georgia.;2007-12-10 19:00:00;10 minutes;Cigar shaped object with bright light zigzagging above Winder Georgia. It was dark outside and we saw a cigar shaped object in the sky, It had a light as if a flashlight and that was shinning, that was the only light on the object.  It had zigzagged through the air for about 2-3 minutes than it look as if it had stopped but the light kept getting dimmer and dimmer as if it was going up.  It had looked like the lights were changing colors from white to yellow.   At first we thought it was a plane but it was going way to slow, and about 4 planes had passed it, and it was to high up.  It also couldn't have been a shooting star because you could see the outside of the shape.  We tried to take a picture but everything else in the sky would show up on the camera except the object in the sky.   Also the light was in what we thought was the front of the object, but then it started going sideways. There was a white haze around the object.;33.9978;-83.7124000000001
No noise and following each other;2009-01-14 00:00:00;3 minites;No noise and following each other My friend and I were riding our Dirbikes we looked two Cigar shaped Flying objects.  They were moving at a very slow pace.  They were following each other perfectly. i was thinking that they were planes until they got right over us.  They were making no noise. I had recently watched UFO hunters and that is an Attribute that they said most UFO's have.  I called the Hotline and they rejeceted my call because they said that i was young and basically lying.  I'm 16 and i swear on anything that whatever that we saw was not somthing Ordinary.;33.9978;-83.7124000000001
