Disc shaped UFO with prismatic lights around its perimeter in sky for over an hour;2016-09-07 00:00:00;>1 hour;Disc shaped UFO with prismatic lights around its perimeter in sky for over an hour The UFO was spotted over a treeline from our backyard by 3 witnesses.  It stayed in place for over an hour, and was bright in the sky (2 planes passed by for reference and though they were closer to us, they appeared roughly the same size as the UFO and generated less/fewer lights). Viewing the UFO through binoculars yielded a clear view of a disc shaped craft with prismatic colors (all colors of the spectrum) along its perimeter (looked like flashing Christmas tree lights around a disc).

Circular UFO above a wooded area and flashing several different colors.;2016-09-07 01:00:00;1+ hour;Circular UFO above a wooded area and flashing several different colors. Was first spotted above a wooded area about 3-4 miles away.  The object was very still with many flashing colors including red, blue, green, and white.  These colors appear to be under the object.  At one point it turned a bit to its side and I was able to see the shape of the craft which was circular.  After about an hour, it started to move up and further away at a very slow rate.  It was a clear sky and no clouds in sight.;33.9978;-83.7124000000001
