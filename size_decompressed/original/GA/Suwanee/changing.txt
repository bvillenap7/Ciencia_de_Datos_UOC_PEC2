Flattened cylindrical object floating through the sky.;2001-06-14 20:45:00;1 minute;Flattened cylindrical object floating through the sky. On my way home I happened to look in the sky and noticed what appeared to be a flattened cylindrical object floating through the sky. It seemed to morph into varying shapes slowly and drifted as if it were a balloon. The object was approximately 700 ft in the air and nightfall was quickly approaching. I pulled my car off on the side of the road and watched it. It appeared as though it were simply floating but it did not look like a balloon or birds or a plane or anything like that. I am 34 years old and I have never seen anything like this floating through the sky. Most of the time it looked like a rounded black boomerang where each side would move forward and backward. There were no lights and it eventually faded into the clouds and into the night.;34.0409;-84.0237000000021
