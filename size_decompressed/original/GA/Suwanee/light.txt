Perfect ball of light moving at tremendous speed that made no sound.;2002-12-15 22:30:00;30 - 45 secs.;Perfect ball of light moving at tremendous speed that made no sound. While taking trash bin down to the end of our driveway, which is approximately 250 feet, my son who is fourteen (14) saw a light appear behind a neighbor's house.  The light proceeded at a speed...that is hard to describe on a horizontal path until it disappeared and seemed to land beyond the horizon behind some trees.  My son described the light as perfect ball of light that did not give off light but 'was' light and made no sound...but moved at a speed unlike anything I've [my son] has every seen and is hard to describe.....;34.0409;-84.0237000000021
High bright object transverses Atlanta skyline;2007-06-04 22:12:00;1.30 minutes;High bright object transverses Atlanta skyline A single bright light traveling from the NE skyline to the SW skyline.  Object was higher than the ATL air traffic pattern to the west.  Object showed constant brightness throughout its trajectory with a constant speed.  There were No port/starboard lights or flashing lights.  Nearly as bright as Venus in the East. Had a slight wobble. At the overhead midpoint, another small dark object that flashed on then off intermittently, bisected the path of the first object at a more westerly flight path and lower in height. The second object was moving at a high rate of speed and was visible for only seconds.  I am outside every night between 2200 and 2230 to let the dogs out and study the night sky and the ATL flight paths. Objects were not in any flight path to ATL. I am a ten year Navy Veteran Shipboard Signalman. I have seen satellites at night track from horizon to horizon in the middle of the ocean.  I have seen other strange lights track in the dark ocean sky.  I was surprised to see one here in the city of Atlanta. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus currently is in the western evening sky.  Jupiter is in the southeast.  PD));34.0409;-84.0237000000021
Flashing craft appears like a star, moving jerkily and stayed in a portion of the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2007-11-27 01:30:00;1 + HOURS;Flashing craft appears like a star, moving jerkily and stayed in a portion of the sky, but continuously moving in ufo-like ways An object that I originally thought was a star, but it was flashing a lot, so I continued to watch it, and it started to make jerky movements, but staying in the general area of the sky.  I used tree branches as references to measure if it was moving or not, and several times it moved accross the branch and i'd have to move where i was sitting.  The movements were completely sporatic, jerky, and there were longish periods of time where it would stay in the same spot. It seems to me that this jerkily moving flashing star-looking ufo  was trying to blend in with the stars, but after watching it for over an hour, it WITH OUT A DOUBT moved several hundreds of miles in the sky (although it only looked like 5 inches of the sky) i also saw what looked to be like an extremely fast red-beam that shot from the object, this only happend once, but i could not stay up all night watching it.... it's still over gwinnet county right now ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??

Red lights over Suwanee Georgia;2012-05-20 21:00:00;5 min;Red lights over Suwanee Georgia 4 individual crafts.  One red light each.  Less than 5,000 ft. high.  Moving slowly.  No sound.  At one point, there were only two.  Moving from 5 o'clock to 11 o'clock.  When the second light got close to the first light, it changed course and began to come directly towards me.   I got back on the road and returned home for my phone and video camera and never saw them again.  I would provide more details, but I will be shocked if someone didn't get this on video.;34.0409;-84.0237000000021
Blue light flash followed by many army helicopters.;2012-07-21 15:00:00;3 minutes;Blue light flash followed by many army helicopters. Giant blue light that just lasted a couple seconds..  Then about a minute later 8 military helicopters flew over the area.  The helicopters were only traveling about 20 miles per hour.

Red and blue light, so at first I thought it was a plane, way off in the distance and high- like a plane at full altitude.;2013-09-18 22:30:00;5 minutes;red and blue light, so at first I thought it was a plane, way off in the distance and high- like a plane at full altitude.  But then it shot across the sky, paused and went back the other way.  Then it went back again, and changed direction, moving up and down diagonally. I t came towards me and then went back.  After a few minutes, it dropped straight down out of view behind the trees;34.0409;-84.0237000000021
Two separate red lights, bright red center, like orbs, flew over back yard trees, slowly with no sound.;2014-07-05 22:00:00;3 minutes;Two separate red lights, bright red center, like orbs, flew over back yard trees, slowly with no sound. Sitting on back porch with friends, I saw a red circular light coming toward us overhead and crossed over us.  There were several trees and I noticed it thought the branches.  It caught my eye b/c it was very unusual, in color (bright red center w/lighter red ring around not blinking no white or green like a plane/chopper), distance (close enought to make some noise), speed, with absolutely no sound.   In all my years I have never seen anything like it. It came across a small clearing before going over the house.   There should have been some sound, but none.  About 30 seconds later a second one came over almost the same path, but higher up (light was smaller), still no sound.   The second one my wife noticed as it went over the house and she doesn't believe at all :( and she even thought it was unusual and did a double take.;34.0409;-84.0237000000021
