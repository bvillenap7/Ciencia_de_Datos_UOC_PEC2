Thought it was a plane but it quickly changed its flight pattern and crossed over the road and over the tree line.   There where red and green lights on the bottom that were flashing and it resembled a sand dollar with the holes being the lights.  It was changing colors and flying too quickly to be a plane or helicopter.;34.0409;-84.0237000000021
Lots of green lights that couldnt come from any humans or objects at all, then a possible ufo sighting.;2015-04-12 01:00:00;5 minutes;Lots of green lights that couldnt come from any humans or objects at all, then a possible ufo sighting. OK so we were pulling into Dunkin Donuts and there were multiple flashes of green reflecting lights all around the drive in and car for about 15 seconds, we then decided to pull back around in the drive thru to see if we could see the green lights again but there was nothing.   My friends mom was then driving and I was looking out the window when I saw an object in the sky which wasn't a plane and everyone in the car agreed because of the way the lights were and how the shape o the object in the sky was, the lights were set on the object in a more symmetrical manner than a plane would set them, and there was excessive flashing coming from the object, and it wasn't moving quickly but moving ever so slightly,we then pulled into a gas station to observe it and all 3 occupants of the car agreed on the details above including my skeptical friend who would never agree upon a sighting.;34.0409;-84.0237000000021
