It was extremely bright and it was like someone flipped a switch and suddenly it was there. At first I thought it was a planet but the sun was rising in the east and at that time my wife noticed that it was moving due north toward us. I have a 12 power rifle scope that I bird watch with and I tried to look at the object through it. It was so bright it hurt my eye. A few seconds later the object made a sudden turn toward due east and I watched it fade away in just a few seconds. There is the possibility that it was an aircraft at high altitude but I do not believe that an aircraft could turn so suddenly. Also it seemed to be moving extremely slow though it may have seemed that way if it was flying towards us. End of report.;33.2745;-85.132

We watched as a dim light moved slowly toward a tree line, then did a 90 degree turn in mid air and just flew the other way.   We lost vision as it entered the tree line.  It flashed as it turned and flew away.  It looked just like a ball of light.;33.2745;-85.132
