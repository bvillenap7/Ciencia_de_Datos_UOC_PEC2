UFO over FAA center in Hampton, Ga.;2014-07-15 21:45:00;15 seconds;UFO over FAA center in Hampton, Ga. I was at work and I heard a helicopter (I live near and airport and am familiar with the sounds of helicopters). This was like a military helicopter, it had a turbo or jet sound not normal for this area. After approximately 45 seconds of hearing it, the helicopter came into view almost directly overhead. It was heading ESE bearing approximately 122 degrees.  After it passed me, a small, solid, bright white lit was ahead, slightly above, and a little to the south of the helicopter. I focused on the light, and all the sudden at 3 o'clock a red strobe light came on.  About 2 seconds after that at 10 o'clock, a second red strobe light came on. None of these lights were comparable to the helicopter, which had several white and red strobe lights that cycle much fast than the other lights.  Even though the helicopter was closer, the size of the three lights were about 10 times larger (assuming it was one object). I could not tell the distance between the object. The reason I feel like it was one craft is because after the red strobe lights came on, they never wavered in distance from the solid white light and the orientation around the center never changed.  I would estimate the visual contacted lasted 15-20 seconds until I lost it behind the trees. I looked around, but no other witnesses.  I went to tell someone and they said watch this and said, Sir, what's above me?. Apparently, this guy has done this on several occasions and it shows all flights around (we're just south of Atlanta and generally there is some kind of traffic), but this time it showed nothing.  He stated that this was unusual.  As I have never done it, I don't know. Incidentally, the craft in question flew directly over the FAA center, which I believe has a no-fly zone over it (I have never seen any air traffic over it).  The helicopter was just north of the Center.;33.4124999999999;-84.3011999999999
