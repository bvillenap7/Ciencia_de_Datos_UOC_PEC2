I was driving home from the store was sitting at a light and looked up and saw a silver ball traveling at a high rate of speed going from north to south, then it went in a cloud.  Clouds were only on my left side clear blue sky on the rest of the sky. I looked back from where it came from then back to the cloud and saw anther one going in to the cloud..  Then a fighter jet followed them in to the cloud. They were very fast and went the from one side of my windshield to the other side in about 2 sec.
