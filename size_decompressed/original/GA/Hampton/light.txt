light fading and reappearing  ((Venus??));2004-08-14 05:00:00;15min;light fading and reappearing I was looking at what i thought was a bright star that dimmed out and lit up again several minutes later in a slightly different spot- then it dimmed out and lit up again for a minute- then it reappeared again in a different spot in sky- I know it was a different spot each time judging by the tree lines- there was no movement while it was lit up though ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??));33.4124999999999;-84.3011999999999
