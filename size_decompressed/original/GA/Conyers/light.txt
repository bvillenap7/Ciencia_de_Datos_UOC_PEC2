Simple unmoving red light close to the moon that simply disappeared.;2000-07-04 21:45:00;5-10 seconds;Simple unmoving red light close to the moon that simply disappeared. I was over at a friends house with another buddy of mine (that makes 3 who were there at the time and 3 who saw it) Another buddy of ours was on his way there, that was why we were outside, we were waiting on him, tossin' the football. When we got out on the grass in the front yard, I looked up at the moon, which was a cresant. I guess about that same time I saw the red light, one of my buddies did too. We both acknowledged that it was there, then my other friend saw it. It was slightly below and left of the moon. At first, I thought it was a star, but it was alittle too large to be one and it was red. Then friend #1 said it might be Venus, and I said it might be Mars. A few seconds later, it just disappeared. I didn't notice it dim at all, it's like the light just turned off. I though maybe a cloud had gone in front of it, but it was pretty clear that night and we kept a look out for it for a half an hour later, and it still didn't appear back.;33.6553924369748;-84.0191008403361

This is very common since i live right under a flight pattern. I continued to watch it while conversing with my wife and noticed the second light hadn't deviated from its position, nor did it have the usual blinking lights we see on aircraft. I continued to watch it as 3 more aircraft past the point and moved by and i asked my wife to observe it. We continued to watch it and it did not move. I figured it was likely a planet so i wanted to check it out with my binoculars. I had my wife continue to watch it while i went and retrieved the binoculars. I returned and focused on the object and when i first focused it i saw what appeared to by a pattern of lights like this ....., i then gave my wife the binoculars and she observed it for a while. She stated that is looked like a star. My mother had just came over and she commented that it was the North star. i continued to observe it further, this time it was spherical, distant and not moving. At this point i wrote it off as a planet and went back in side. about a minute later i grabbed some garbage and went out to the trash. Again i looked up and this time there was absolutely nothing in the sky. My conclusion is there would be no way that a star or other planetary body could move across the horizon that fast. It was the brightest object i could see in the sky at the time and observing it with and without the binoculars i saw no movement whatsoever, nor any additional lights after the first observance.;33.6553924369748;-84.0191008403361

Object seen flying over interstate, increasing in brightness, then vanishing into thin air.;2015-01-05 07:18:00;3 minutes;Object seen flying over interstate, increasing in brightness, then vanishing into thin air. Object seen under the moon flying from north to south towards the observers over interstate. It was moving quickly and growing in size.  It seemed to turn in a slight half circle then briefly appeared to increase in size and intensity of brightness for roughly 3 seconds.  The object then vanished into thin air. Planes could be seen in the same field of vision but were not similar in aircraft lighting.  Clouds and air conditions did not play a factor in visibility.;33.6553924369748;-84.0191008403361

There was one (very) bright gold light for each, followed by three red lights in a horizontal row.  They moved somewhat slowly, and appeared to hover intermittently, and one of them changed direction more than once, lazily moving one way, then another.  There was a soft sound like a jet engine, but given how bright they were (and therefore close, I assume), I would have expected it to be much louder.;33.6553924369748;-84.0191008403361
Several drone looking objects in the sky at night.;2019-02-13 17:00:00;1 hour;Several drone looking objects in the sky at night. Lots of drone looking objects in the sky going back and forth.  Noticeably not airplanes or helicopters.  The lights vary from LED looking lights to yellow lights.  Been seeing it for multiple nights in the same area around the 8:30pm.  One of them got pretty close and looked similar to 3 light orbs organized in a triangle formation.  Really weird.;33.6553924369748;-84.0191008403361
