The object caught my eye because it was too big to be a plane, the shape was different and the lighting was solid. The shape was blimp like, but the shape was almost like a domed serving platter. THe light was white like a star coloring, not overly bright though. The object first appeared to be hovering and then it was moving off towards the West (I think). I was trying to drive and keep the object in my view. I did stop and try to get a better look, but then the trees blocked my sight. It was also moving away from me and getting smaller. As I lost site, I got back on Salem Road and turned onto Brown Bridge Road heading towards Mcdonough. I caught site of the object again but it was moving away and the trees were blocking my view. I tried to keep up with it and eventually lost it completely. I remember feeling like I could not be the only one seeing this. I thought about it just being a blimp, but the time and the look did not make me believe it was anything short of abnormal. After arriving home, I searched the skies without any luck. I immediately searched the internet to see if anyone had reported seeing it. I know that I saw something other than an ordinary aircraft;33.6553924369748;-84.0191008403361
