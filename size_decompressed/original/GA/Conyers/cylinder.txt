In the same  city I might add. I was driving home with my Mother and saw a cylinder shape metal object floating in the sky to my right.  I KNEW what it was as soon as I saw it.  I looked up 5 times and it was floating right there in broad daylight as clear as the sky.  I looked down and drove another 50 feet and the craft was absolutely gone.It was a perfectly blue sky that day.  Nothing on earth can float like that in a stationary position and then be gone completely from the sky within 10 seconds. My mother was with me I told her look look 4 times :) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.6553924369748;-84.0191008403361
