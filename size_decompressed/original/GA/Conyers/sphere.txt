On my way home from church and I saw a bright blue spherical object fall from the sky in what seemed to be a perfectly vertical fashion.  I shouted and simultaneously slammed on my breaks to an almost complete stop because it scared me.  The two passengers in my car did not see the object in time and were probably more focused on my erratic driving and shouting to see it in time.  I am an avid sky watcher have seen bolides, meteors and know my stars well.  This was nothing like anything I have ever seen before.  It seemed different because the light was constant with no tail and no fade.  The object seemed to drop faster than free fall and disappeared as the tree line near the hospital shielded my view.;33.6553924369748;-84.0191008403361
Small red light floating in my yard.;2014-01-23 22:00:00;5 seconds;Small red light floating in my yard. Saw a 2 inch in diameter small red ball float in front of the bushes in my yard really slow.  Then it just vanished.   It didn't have a trail like a laser pin light, it was just this red light floating by itself.   It made a high pitched whistle noise.

Wide set apart and too far apart to be attached to the tail and obviously not on a wing. The tail lights proceeded to alternate from on, off, just the left on, just the right on, double right only like a wink or Morse code and etc.  It was not a set pattern or flashing lights like on all the other aircraft that passes over me.  Also the undercarriage stripes light lit up the bottom from nose to tail (which is why I thought it was a plane initially) but that coupled with the circle of running lights on its sides around it after it was headed away from me gave it a distinctly spherical shape as if the lights were separate from a different object within.... Like those gr! avity things they used to have at Chuck E Cheese they'd strap a kid in and then spin a bunch of metal circles separately from the ring you were strapped in spinning in...  Then 1 minute later....after my shock at the tail lights seeming to say hello to me...there was suddenly a bright light in the sky that blinked out right after it appeared...almost like a star in the sky suddenly turned on brighter and then blew out like a lightbulb....that was behind me, where the UFO first appeared...because I walked across my field mesmerized watching the tail lights...and then while walking back is when the bright light happened in a flash.;33.6553924369748;-84.0191008403361
