bright blue fireball;2003-04-24 05:20:00;SECONDS;bright blue fireball I had let my four dogs out in the back yard for their morning break.  It was still dark, I was looking up at the sky when in the distance I this giant blue fireball.  At first thought to myself, it's a comet.  Then I told myself, no it's blue. It looked like a great big gas flame, only it was really big. It came from the West and was headed East.  As it went infront of me, the dogs ran inside and I ran further out in the yard and lost sight of it thru the trees.  I really couldn't tell just how close it was.  It looked like it behind the Pine Trees at the back of my yard, yet just above the house behind me, like tree top high.  As I watched it go out of sight, I stood there listening for a crash or something.  What was it?  It made no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
