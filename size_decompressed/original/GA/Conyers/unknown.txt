Craft seen falling and dissapears into thin air.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch??  We have no explanation for the aircraft.  PD));2007-10-10 20:30:00;1 hour;Craft seen falling and dissapears into thin air. Around 8pm we went out for a trip to Burger King.  I noticed a large number of planes hovering above the city.  They were not passenger planes, presumably fighter jets from the looks of them.  Each had a red white and blue light.  They were flying in pairs back and forth across the sky at staggered heights.  After driving home and watching the planes (we counted approximately 10), we sat out on the roof of the car and watched.   Around 8:30pm we saw an abject appear, and move at extremely high speed in a downward direction as though it were about to crash into the ground, but disappeared before it ever left the sky line.  Immediately after the planes began to clear away, although a few still scanned the skylines, but much higher in the air.  In the beginning the plans were exceptionally low.

Star-like object with blue light twinkling around it and moves up and down and side to side in Conyers, GA;2008-10-26 02:00:00;still out there;Star-like object with blue light twinkling around it and moves up and down and side to side in Conyers, GA My dog is outside and keeps barking so I looked outside to see what he is barking at.  I didn't see anything but looked up at the sky and noticed how clear the sky was and how pretty the stars looked.  But I looked over and noticed a brighter star that twinkled a lot more than the others and almost looked like a bluish color.  It was at the top of a tree so at first it was partially hidden.  Then all of a sudden, it moved up in the sky, then over to the side.  It did not move in a straight line and did not stay in one spot.  I kept watching it and it looked as if it were swaying side to side.  It moved like someone had a star on the end of a string and was moving it up then sideways then back over then way up.  I noticed a bluish light twinkling around it.  I tried to get my camera out and use the lens to zoom in but I couldnt see it any better.  I have never seen anything like this before.  An aircraft went by and it had a red light blinking on it and the object did not move at that moment but looked like a star. Once the aircraft was gone, the object moved to the side quickly.;33.6553924369748;-84.0191008403361

I looked up in the sky and saw a wierd object that appeared to be coming closer and getting farther away while still staying the same size. I yelled and told my friends to look and they too saw the wierd objects in the sky. Later that night after we had went home, we saw wierd light formations and star patterns.
