Drifting pair of solid and flashing red lights over north Georgia mountains.;2006-12-05 19:08:00;2 minutes;Drifting pair of solid and flashing red lights over north Georgia mountains. I was headed west on Hwy 325, which is a connector road that cross Lake Nottely just north of Blairsville GA.   As I was coming to the dam, about a half mile away, I saw a red light, probably about 5000 feet up or so (purely a guess).  It was a bright red light, with another red flashing light next to it.  I thought it was an airplane of some sort at first, but this was drifting far slower than airplanes we normally see.  Too, the flashing red light just didn't look right.  The lights were big, not the small red lights one usually sees on an aircraft.  Too, there were no other lights. Most aircraft usually have a flashing white light, don't they?  Regardless, the lights were vertically overhead when I saw them, and drifted ever so slowly to the south.  As I got to the dam, the lights had only moved a bit to the south, no more so that I was still looking up about 45-50 degrees over the horizon.  It was no where near going behind the horizon or the mountains here.   But, the lights both went out and I could not see any craft, or lights any more.  The night was clear and cold, and there were no clouds for the lights to disappear behind.  I had also opened the window when I first noticed them, but heard no sound of airplane or helicopter engine.;34.8789604651163;-83.9912883720931
White light that abruptly made a 90 degree angle turn;2020-06-12 19:30:00;4-5 seconds;White light that abruptly made a 90 degree angle turn Observed one object that looked like a shooting star traveling from West to East. Duration of a few seconds then disappeared. Appeared again in same line of travel for a few seconds and then made a 90 degree angle turn to the South. Then after a few seconds was no longer visible. About 10 seconds later observed the same thing. Then again a few seconds after that. So three sightings in all in a short period of time.;34.8789604651163;-83.9912883720931
