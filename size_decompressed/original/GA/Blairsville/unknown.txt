Intermittant streak by moon, not seen on photo taken 10 seconds earlier.;2006-10-10 12:37:00;<10 sec.;Intermittant streak by moon, not seen on photo taken 10 seconds earlier. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  Witness provides a very nice photo, which shows an intermittent, white contrail-like trail across a clear blue sky, just one Moon diameter to the left of a crescent Moon.  Our suspicion is that it was a contrail behind a jet fighter, or perhaps the trail behind a meteor.  We suspect the former, given the intermittent nature of the streak.
