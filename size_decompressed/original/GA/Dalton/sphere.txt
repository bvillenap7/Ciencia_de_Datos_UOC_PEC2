Craft moving west with random sequence of colored light emission.;2012-04-01 22:30:00;2 hours;Craft moving west with random sequence of colored light emission. At the approximate time listed I arrived home and glanced up into the sky to see a point of light larger than the surrounding stars at 244 degrees SW.  An airplane was also in the vicinity approximately 1/2 mile from the location.  The airplane flew straight past the other craft as the latter was sitting stationary. I believed the strange light to be a star and that the twinkling light was caused by interference of particles in the atmosphere.  Upon closer examination the object appeared to flash with 3 distinct colors and several combinations of the 3.  Red and blue followed by green then an assortment of purples and yellows then back to the red, blue, green pattern.  I opened a star map on my android phone and the particular point had no listing for stars, planets, satellites, or other space material that should be currently located in that area. After about 20 minutes of stationary observation I noticed that the craft began to move and the longer I stared at it the farther west it traveled until it was lost over the horizon around 00:10. I can give the exact latitude and longitude of the location where the observers stood.;34.7681382789318;-84.9799002967348
