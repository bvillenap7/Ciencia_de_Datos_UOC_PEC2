Seen a fireball with a tail that changed colors.;2006-11-28 19:00:00;approx. 10 seconds;Seen a fireball with a tail that changed colors. We saw an object shooting across the sky that looked like a fireball with a long tail. It appeared to change colors, light pink and green, and it broke into about 2-3 pieces before it disappeared altogether.;34.7681382789318;-84.9799002967348
Five firballs that dissapeared into the sky.;2010-02-20 07:00:00;3-5 minutes;Five firballs that dissapeared into the sky. The strange thing is me and my boyfriend were in a cemetery taking snapshots trying to catch anything “creepy” just for fun.  We parked on one of the cemetery roads and my boyfriend says “look at those helicopters”  We got out of the car to see what we thought were five helicopters flying up and at an angle in the sky.  Almost at the same time we realized they all looked like they were on fire.  I pulled out my camera and video taped it immediately.  When we cam home I googled what UFO sightings look like because we weren’t sure.  The first video we pulled up was the same exact thing we had seen but it was in Scotland two nights prior.  I would really like to know what it is we saw. I dont know how to send the video it is too large.  We have proof.  The link to the Scotland sighting is:  :http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjuK77HDgJc;34.7681382789318;-84.9799002967348
