3 spinning lights in the sky , 2 appeared to be spinning CW and 1 CCW.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-23 20:30:00;Unsure;3 spinning lights in the sky, 2 appeared to be spinning clockwise and 1 counterclockwise, we thought we saw a 4th light for moment, the lights reminded me of the bag lanterns ppl sometime release, though theses lights seemed to far away and too large to be that, eventually i had too get back to responsibilities and could no longer witness the lights that still remained in the sky, i should also mention that though the lights seemed separate they still looked like they stayed in a triangular formation and could possibly been part of one thing rather than 3 separate.
