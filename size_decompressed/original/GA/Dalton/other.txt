Bronze colored object floats up from wooded area., just off the Northbound side of I-75 near Dalton,Ga.;2006-10-23 14:30:00;approx. 15-30sec;Bronze colored object floats up from wooded area., just off the Northbound side of I-75 near Dalton,Ga. Driving down I-75 South towards Atlanta, we had just passed thru Dalton,Ga.,  a large bronze colored object(somewhat like a flat bottomed loaf of bread you get at a steakhouse)floated up from behind some trees/wooded area on the Northbound side of I-75, near some farmland. I thought it was a balloon of some sort. It was windy, and cloud shadows were passing over it...then it inclined its front/side? at an 45 degree angle and slide silently up into the clouds and disappeared. I yelled to my wife and another couple, Did you see that???!!!!Did you see it!!!?? They were enjoying the scenery around our vehicle as we traveled south except where I had been looking/pointing. Visibility was almost unlimited. Sunny, with some clouds and a light breeze.;34.7681382789318;-84.9799002967348
