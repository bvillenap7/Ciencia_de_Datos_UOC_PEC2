As we were driving home on Cogburn Rd we saw what appeared to be 3 bright lights that made a triangle shape moving slowly north.  Then what appeared to ba a second set of 3 lights in the same shape but a bit dimmer than the first as if it were farther away or higher.   I took several photos and a video out of the car as we were driving then stopped about 1 half mile in a driveway to watch as they headed slowly toward us.  As they were over head each light seamed to fizzle out one at a time.;34.111;-84.3025
