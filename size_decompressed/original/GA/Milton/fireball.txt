Burning fireball streaking across sky and breaking up.;2013-09-28 19:44:00;6-8 seconds;Burning fireball streaking across sky and breaking up. Clear sky at dusk.  Standing by pond fishing.  Saw what looked like a green firework streaming from NW to SE. Compass heading about 140 degrees.  Streaked from my 2 o clock position to my 10 o clock.  Looked like a firework, but didn't have any arc.  Was burning green, and then at my 11 o clock position it broke into 5-6 pieces and color turned orange like a fire ember burning out, then disappeared.  Reminded me also of a falling star hitting the atmosphere, but this seemed to be low level.  There was an airliner in the background at cruise altitude for reference.  No sound associated with it.;34.111;-84.3025
