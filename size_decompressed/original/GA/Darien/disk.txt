I took out my phone and tried to record but I couldn’t get it to focus. The lights seemed to move around and almost seem to flash.  The disk shaped object then moved out of sight very fast.  Me and my step dad both were in complete shock and I don’t know if anyone else seen it but the lights were yellow/ white and the craft blended in with the gray night sky .;31.3826;-81.4282
