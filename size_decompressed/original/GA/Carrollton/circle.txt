Tonight, there were about six long super bright objects flashing different colors and surrounded by blue aura.   From the one that seemed to be the highest, a very dimly lit round object seemed to have come out the side of it and flew slowly (higher than planes) in a north easterly direction then disappeared.  It never made a sound and definitely wasn't a plane or helicopter.   Shortly afterwards, a helicopter then a commercial plane flew over.  I had my son come outside and see all the super bright long lights.  This cheap phone wouldn't capture any clear images!;33.5825080862535;-85.0788374663082
