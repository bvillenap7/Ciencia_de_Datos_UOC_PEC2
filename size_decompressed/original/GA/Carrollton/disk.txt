I was getting ready for bed at approximately 10:00 pm. I went to the bathroom and did not turn on any lights and looked out the bathroom window and saw a huge orange glow on the ground.  I first thought it was a bonfire or someone in our pasture.  The object was on the ground and I could see definition in the lights going around the object.  I studied the object for several minutes going back into my bedroom to see if maybe it was a glare from the TV or some other light in my house.  I turned off the TV and there were no other lights on in my house and went back to look and it was still there.  I then went into my dining room area an looked out that window and watched the object again.  I then called my 17 year old son to come look at this as well.  He watched the object with me in disbelief trying to figure out what the bright orange glow was.  We than went outside on the carport and it was very quiet and my dog was not barking at the object.  My son went in the front yard to look to see if it was the moon somehow glaring in the pasture but it was not.  I called for him to come in the house because I was actually beginning to get frightened at this point.  I do live near West Georgia Regional Airport and thought maybe it was some sort of aircraft.  We went into the house and within 10 seconds when we left the back yard and went back to the dining room area the object had disappeared.   I also could see a strange glow where the object had been.  My son and I both could see the definition of the lights on the center of the object and it was very bright.  I know what we saw was something out of this world and know that we cannot be the only life in the universe. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Darting across the sky and then bunched up like they became o 5 saucer shaped objects rotating  around each other almost like 5 drones would do.  Darting back and forth and rotate around each other and then would space out across the sky and come right back together.  It was cloudy and they cast off a light bluish white glow.  There was no noise of any type from these crafts.   I witness something very similar In Camack, Ga.   I am a person that is honest, truthful and I have Integrity with all who know me!
