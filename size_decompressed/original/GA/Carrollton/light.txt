Shooting star stopped and hovered and was caught on video.;2016-08-29 21:30:00;30+ minutes;shooting star stopped and hovered and was caught on video. It was on 08/29/16 at approx. 2130 hrs I was rolling my trash can down to the curb for next day trash pick-up.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a “shooting star”, as I looked at it the object came to a complete stop just above the horizon.  I then retrieved my astronomy binoculars (20x80) to make sure it wasn’t just a coincident.  After seeing that it wasn’t a plane or star I got my camera out and video taped it.  The object just sat there changing colors but not moving.  The next night I went out at the same time to make sure it wasn’t a star and there was nothing even close to what it looked like.
