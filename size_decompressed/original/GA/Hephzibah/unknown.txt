There were three white lights, shape was unclear from our angle, it was resting up and to the left of us in the clouds and did not move. When I saw it at first I thought it was an airplane flying way too low but then I noticed it wasn’t moving. I fumbled for about thirty seconds to get my camera on record and about ten seconds into the recording it just slowly vanished like it went stealth. It didn’t move the entire time, no towers around, no flights landing at the small airport nearby because we passed it shortly after and there were no additional planes on the parking strip. I caught a video of the unidentified aircraft, myself and two children witnessed it. There were about 5 or 6 other cars in the road but I don’t know if they saw it as well.;33.3449;-82.0828999999999
