Huge Rectangular Craft  With LightsTraveling at a High Rate of Speed;2010-05-18 12:30:00;<1 minute;Huge Rectangular Craft  With LightsTraveling at a High Rate of Speed On 18 May at approximately 12:30 PM, I saw a very large object in the sky moving very quickly across the sky.  The shape of the object was rectangular and it had lights around the perimeter.  It looked like a flying building.  I was traveling down a state highway in the east central town of Hephzibah, Georgia.  This is a four-lane highway with a median and cars travel very fast on this road.  As I saw the object in the sky, other drivers saw it as well and started braking and pointing at the object.  I witnessed the object for less than a minute when it rapidly accelerated and disappeared from view in about 3 seconds.  It was clearly visible there were few clouds in the sky.  It looked nothing like a plane or a balloon or a helicopter or any other terrestrial flying object.;33.3449;-82.0828999999999
