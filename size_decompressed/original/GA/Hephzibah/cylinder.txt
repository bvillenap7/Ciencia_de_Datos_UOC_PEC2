Red glowing object over Hephzibah during  lighting storm;2012-06-14 22:00:00;1 min;Red glowing object over Hephzibah during  lighting storm   I was taking night photo's of lighting strikes coming out of a cloud passing over Richmond-Burk county line. I was standing back from the camera while it was taking a 30 second exposure, when I noticed 3 red objects to the right of the cloud.  I thought it was Mars at first but then they glowed bright red and vanished.  I was shooting with a wide angle of 18mm and caught a digital image.   A white one over the cloud and a red one to the right of the cloud.;33.3449;-82.0828999999999
