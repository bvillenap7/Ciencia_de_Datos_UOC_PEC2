5 Bright Orange lights over South Augusta, Georgia;2012-04-25 21:15:00;15 seconds;5 Bright Orange lights over South Augusta, Georgia I observed 5 large bright orange lights in the sky April 25, 2012 at around 9:15 pm. Near Augusta, Georgia. I was sitting in my sunroom at my computer, with several blinds opened in front of me.  I caught a glimpse of a bright orange light that appeared in the sky.  I believe it was Southwest direction.  As I was watching the light for a few seconds, it vanished, however just a little ways over, another appeared like the first and vanished.  Then the same thing happened 3 more times.  It looked like it was moving in a straight line. Then it was gone. I went to my back porch to see if I could see it again.  All kinds of planes were flying back and forth where this had occurred, as if searching for it.  I called the newspapers and news channels in my area to see if anyone else had reported seeing the mysterious lights.  But no one did. This was the second time I had witnessed something similar.  About 2 years ago, on the same porch, I saw 3 lights in a row hovering over my house.  I stepped off the porch to get a better look I watched them hover for a few seconds, not making a sound.  Then the lights began to move at a fast speed in a row towards the stars in a Southern direction.;33.3449;-82.0828999999999
