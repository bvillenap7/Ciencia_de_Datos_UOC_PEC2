Bright yellowish disk object;2001-08-04 22:00:00;continous;Bright yellowish disk object I am still having continous observations of some type of craft. It appears as a bright cross when viewed on a low powered telescope. When I put my 10 Telescope with video on it it appears as a firey sun (yellowish) looking disk that is **EXTREMLY** bright in the center. Never the less, you can still make out a dark object that looks like a disk in the center. I have very detailed video through my telescope (I have a Meade Lx200 10 with an Astrovid 2000 video camera attached). This object appears every night for the past 3 - 4 weeks. There is also another object that is more white in color that appears near the back of my property in the early morining (0530 hrs)the night object is not present in the morning, I will soon get video of this! This is not a prank. I filed a report earlier but notice that it was not posted. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe Venus is visible in the morning sky, at present.  Given that the event occurs daily.  PD));32.296;-81.2354
