We saw a cylindrical object almost float through the sky fairly quickly, faster than a plane but also silent, then disappear all of a sudden.  It was very close to us and if it were a plane we would have heard it.  If it were a meteor or a comet, it would have had a tail.  Then we saw another similar object hovering slightly to the right of where we first saw the previous object, it then began slowly moving upwards.;32.296;-81.2354
