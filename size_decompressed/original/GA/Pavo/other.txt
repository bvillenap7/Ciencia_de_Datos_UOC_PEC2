Giant oblong rock with a black row of windows across the center;2014-03-18 18:01:00;30-60 seconds;Giant oblong rock with a black row of windows across the center On March 18, 2014 at 6:01 pm eastern standard time, I was driving northeast on GA122 northeast of Pavo, GA on a stretch of road between GA274 and GA333 when thru my windshield on my right I saw a large rock like object moving oddly (small skips) in the sky.  It looked/colored like a giant oblong rock with a row of square black windows that didnâ€™t reflect light running the center length of it. I realized it was going to cross the road ahead of me from right to left so I matched its speed of 60mph so I could pass underneath it.  The object was about 150ft-300ft in the air.  The objects size was about 300ft long, 100ft tall, and at least 200ft wide (it took 2-3 seconds to pass beneath it).  There were no wings, rotors, or any visible means of propulsion. The object was not an airplane, blimp, helicopter, and was not being towed or carried from above.  Looking out the drivers side window I passed under and the bottom was flat, black, with a symbol running the fo! rward width of it (a white circle with a single white line on either side), and the length of the object was elongated oval.  While driving underneath I felt an odd downward pressing feeling.  Looking back thru the drivers side window the opposite side was the same as I first approached it.  I turned to look forward and a driver in the opposite lane was approaching me and was looking up thru their windshield in awe at the object I had just driven under.  I turned to look back thru my drivers side window as the other driver passed me and the object had moved away continuing northwest.  The encounter lasted about 30-60 seconds.;30.9422;-83.7415
