Low lights seen in sky in rural south georgia;2012-01-11 22:40:00;10 minutes;Low lights seen in sky in rural south georgia It happened on January 11, 2012, between 10:35 and 10:45 p.m.   My boyfriend and I were headed north on GA 159 when we saw some lights flying really low to the ground less than a mile past Haw Pond Road.  It was heading across the road from east to west.  There were two red lights and two white lights across from each other forming a diamond shape.   At first, we thought it was a plane and were alarmed because it was right above tree level, about 100-150 ft up.   As it crossed the road, he stopped the car and rolled the window down, but we didn't hear an engine.  It was a very still night.  The craft came to a stop, then proceeded to move in the south-western direction.   We turned around to see if we could follow it, turning down Haw Pond Road.  We lost sight of it, so we turned back around to head home. As we got back to the origin of the sighting, the craft was crossing the road again, heading in the same direction as it was before.  We're not sure if it was the same craft or a second, but it looked exactly the same as before.   We proceeded to slow down again, and as we passed it, it appeared to be shining us with one of its white lights.   My boyfriend accelerated after we saw this, and the craft headed in the northern direction.  We lost sight of it through the trees.;31.7097;-83.6625
