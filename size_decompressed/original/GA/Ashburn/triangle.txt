Translucent Craft that makes No Sound While Moving;1990-10-10 21:00:00;2 minutes;Translucent Craft that makes No Sound While Moving My mother and I were going to church to practice music for an up coming concert.  We arrived before the others and did not have a key to get in the church, so we waited outside.  It was a very nice fall night, a full moon, but covered with clouds.  The clouds were traveling in a southeasterly direction, with the moon behind them the clouds were lit up like a neon sign.  For whatever reason we both looked up at the same time.  There was a translucent object traveling in a southwesterly direction, exactly opposite of the clouds.  All you could see was the outline of the craft.  It looked like a stealth bomber, but 10 times larger and the most remarkable thing of all, it made absolutely no sound what so ever as it passed over.
