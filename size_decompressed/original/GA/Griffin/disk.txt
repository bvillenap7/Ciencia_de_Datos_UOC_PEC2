UFO came down and went behind a hill 300 yards away.;1978-06-30 00:00:00;2 min;UFO came down and went behind a hill 300 yards away. In 1978 I witnesed a ufo while parking in the country side with a girl friend.  I looked up and saw a ufo and my jaw dropped.   My girl friend kept saying whats wrong, whats wrong.  I couldn't speak only stare.  It was about 300 yards away and took 2 minutes to go down behind a hill.   As soon as it disappeared behind the hill I told her I saw a ufo.  We drove down a dirt road trying to see it but the hill was in the way.  I was to afraid to get out and climb the hill.  To this day no body believes me.   I remeber as it was just happening.  I can describe it and draw it.  It was deadly silent and as big as a house.  There were lights that went around it and pointed down as it began to descend below the hill.  I'm really serious....

Saucer shaped UFO.    ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  PD));1979-06-01 21:00:00;1.5 min;Saucer shaped UFO I saw a suacer approach a field behind my car.  I watched it land behind a hill.  I wanted to go see it closer but I had to climb a 15 foot bank and was afraid because I was only 17 at the time.  Made no sound.  Lights encircled it and as it approached the ground lights pointed to the ground and brightened.  About 100 feet in diameter.  About 30 feet thick..

Disks on the night of the crashes.;2001-09-11 20:45:00;15 seconds;Disks on the night of the crashes. I AM VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS REPORT. I do not know what this means but I was getting home from band practice tonight, the night that all the crashes happened. I was looking around the sky for light of planes because I knew they were supposed to be grounded. I looked to the north and saw two disks with lights on the edge through some clouds. They had lights on them that changed in Sync from blue to green. They darted around each other for about 10-15 seconds before I lost track of them. I was really freaked out and I felt like this needed to be shared.;33.2468500000001;-84.2723185185186
