Unknown aerial droning;2011-03-07 02:30:00;15 minutes;Unknown aerial droning My wife awakened me at 02:30 am, there was an mechanical-sounding droning that seemed to be from above our home. It was audible and was very intense. It seemed to have a repeating pattern (e.g. like an engine idling) and you could feel the vibration in your body. Our dogs were barking fiercely at the sound. We never determined where the sound was exactly located. It just seemed to be behind and above our house. Strangely, when my wife exited our bed to look out the bedroom window, the sound immediately stopped. Later, I went to our living room to look around the house, and found our two small dogs in a state of fear. The dog's hair was standing on end. I felt really spooked, as well. The neighborhood was extremely quiet and I never heard another neighborhood dog bark. I am very positive that this was an event outside the norm for my area. It was not typical aircraft noise (or noise from the highway). It had a strange subsonic, sort of effect.;33.2468500000001;-84.2723185185186
