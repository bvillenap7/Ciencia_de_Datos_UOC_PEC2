Very bright Spotlight like light & 2 very dim lights.;2014-01-02 20:00:00;5 minutes;Very bright Spotlight like light & 2 very dim lights. Its a very cold and windy night tonight. Temperatures will reach below 30 degrees.  As I was checking to make sure the tarp didn't fly off our truck bed, I spotted a VERY bright light just over the trees.  Light was very similar to a spotlight & moved around like one so I assumed it may have been a low flying helicopter.  I noticed it was not accompanied by any sound nor did it have any blinking lights like normal aircrafts.  It was ENTIRELY too low to be a star.  After starring non-stop at the light for about 10-15 seconds, it disappeared. I continued to watch for anything moving and thats when I saw 2 very dim lights moving very slowly in opposite directions, but directly alined with each other.  These lights appeared to be very far away, not as far as the stars, but further aways then the very bright light I initially spotted. As they got further & further apart, I lost them.  I didn't see anything after that, but a few airplanes (which I knew were regular aircrafts), but I know that the lights could not have been normal aircrafts.;31.7672;-84.7916
