Standing on my deck with all house lights off and no nearby street lights. One triangular unlit object passed overhead followed by another about 15 seconds later. They traveled from horizon to horizon going from north to south in about 15 seconds each. They appeared pitch black against a silvery dark sky and blacked out stars as they passed over. It was impossible to estimate distance, speed or size. The shape appeared to be approximately triangular with one of the points leading. I got the impression that they were fairly large and covered about 40 degrees of sky. There was no sound.;34.8523;-85.0453
