I was on my way up to my bedroom when I looked out of the large open window and saw 4 bright large triangular objects moving in the sky in a very slow paced but erratic motion.  They were glowing orange and had three lights positioned on each angle.   They hovered around for about three to four minutes closely together and suddenly drifted beyond the mountains.  They were too orange to be planes or helicopters. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.3209;-84.5632
