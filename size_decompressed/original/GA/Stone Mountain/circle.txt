Drone or Survey Mission in Stone Mountain?;1972-07-01 03:00:00;10 minutes;Drone or Survey Mission in Stone Mountain? Late reporting sorry, watching UFO show on TV and thought I'd better report this.  Myself and three other people (2 couples) driving home (apartments in Stone Mountain) from the midnight movie. No booze, no drugs, no traffic at that time of night.  Came around a curve and there was a REALLY bright light shining on the road in front of us.  I was driving and I shut off the headlights in the car.  I remember thinking that we didn't want to be discovered. The craft was so low that we could see the light reflecting off it.  It had lights of it's own but I don't remember the colors.  It seemed to be surveying the road.  The light would follow the left side of the road and then it would cross and follow the right side.  We didn't say anything to each other.  There was no noise from the craft.  Maybe it saw us but it accelerated away fast.  Somebody said follow it.  We were all excited.  There was no road going the way of the craft.  When we got home, we compared notes and we all saw the same thing.  We lost no time  We left the movie at about 1:30 and it was 1 hour drive home.  We called Hartsfield Airport, the police and Dobbins Air Force Base.  Everybody said nothing in the air.  The guy at Dobbins asked me if I wanted to report it.  After thinking about it, I said no and hung up. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Two dots very high in the sky then moved and dissapeard in 5 minuts;2004-10-31 16:45:00;5 minuts;Two dots very high in the sky then moved and dissapeard in 5 minuts About 16:45 I was on top of the Stone Mountain at the park and was laying on a rock  immedialy spoted two circles in the sky fery high obove all the crafts moveing all directions, they were moving very slowly to teh north and then became maybe higher while moving north because I couldn't see them any more after five minuts. Looks like they were still first then moved far. This is my third report since 2002.;33.7915174825175;-84.1875181818182
Bright solid white objects moving swiftly south to north.;2017-10-25 06:50:00;3 minutes;Bright solid white objects moving swiftly south to north. 10/25/17 & 10/26/17 10/25/17 06:50  From my back deck, observing Orion I first witnessed a meteor from what I assumed to be my final expectations of the Orionid shower.  Then suddenly as I looked back at Orion’s belt a solid white light appeared near the Alnilam star, moving north, north west approximately 5 degree off due north.  It moved fairly slowly and appeared to be very high in the sky. To confirm my suspicions a plane with blinking lights came from the northwest moving to the southeast.  They intersected (from my view) and the UFO continued to move in a straight line finally disappearing from view after a full minute of viewing. I turned to view Castor and Pollux, and almost immediately witnessed yet another solid white light moving slowly in the sky coming from I believe to be the Gomeisa and Procyon area moving slowly towards Castor and Pollox.  I observed this movement for about 20-30 seconds. Needless to say, a meteor was joyful enough, but to observe two UFOs within minutes.  I was charged up all day. 10/26/17 06:55 So naturally, I went back out this morning.  Looking towards Orion of course hoping to see another meteor or anything moving I began scanning the sky and again looked towards Castor and Pollux and suddenly in the direction of the M44 cluster a solid white light, larger than the one’s observed yesterday, appeared. Its movement was much different. Initially, it moved to the northwest slowly like the others and then began to turn due north and rapidly increase speed around zenith.  The light began to fade yet I was able to continue observing its speed and direction. It continued arching north for a few more seconds then seemed to completely stop but immediately picked up it’s prior speed along what seemed to be the same arch yet at this point it was arching towards the east and I lost sight. The original speed seemed much like a plane but the increase and higher speeds were not speeds at which normal aircraft could maneuver, moving across an elbow to finger tips worth of (zenith) sky in mere seconds.;33.7915174825175;-84.1875181818182
