We are rarely certain, however, unless follow-up investigation is conducted.)) LIGHTS IN A CIRCULAR FORMATION.  THEY WERE ALMOST FLUID IN MOVEMENT.  THE LIGHTS ROTATED FROM THE INNER CIRCLE AND MOVED OUTWARD IN A ROTATION, THEN INTO THE CENTER CIRCLE.  IT WAS THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD AND IT HOVERED OVER IN THE SKY.  ONLY LIGHTS WERE SEEN, NO SPACESHIP.  IT WAS INCREDIBLE, VERY UNIFORMED, BUT NOTHING LIKE AN AIRPLANE OR BLIMP, JUST LIGHTS.  THE LIGHTS WERE NOT CIRCULAR BUT A CROSS BETWEEN OVAL AND LINEAR.  I WATHCED IT FOR AWHILE BUT, THEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS CANNOT BE REAL. (ALSO, THERE WAS NO SOUND)  SO, I WENT INTO THE GROCERY STORE AND WHEN I CAME OUT, IT WAS GONE. THE LIGHTS WERE VISIBLE FROM MY APARTMENT AND FROM THE GROCERY STORE LOCATED 3 MILE AWAY.  PEOPLE DRIVING IN THEIR CARS COULD SEE THESE LIGHTS, (I SAW THEM SEE THE LIGHTS BECAUSE THEY TOO WERE POINTING IN THEIR DIRECTION).  AND, PEOPLE ENTERING THE GROCERY STORE WERE LOOKING AT THE SKY.  IT WAS EXTREMELY LARGE AND VISIBLE FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.;33.7915174825175;-84.1875181818182

The object was a dot of blue light that almost appeared to be the same type color as blue shade star. It first appeared coming up behind Stone Mountain, (GA) on the southwest side. At first I thought it was a balloon, at some distance because balloons land / take off at a nearby airport. Then the object went up quickly and then changed elevation quickly. When it moved north, it did not move like an airplane or helicopter. It had a smooth but varied motion. Almost a looping type motion. Then it went west, coming directly overhead, with tremendous velocity and gaining altitude until out of site. My wife also saw the object. We were at the Stone Mountain laser show. Everybody was watching the show. I would be interested if you had any other reports. I'd like to emphasize this was not an airplane, a helicopter, balloon, or a stray light from the show. Thanks for taking this report. ((name and contact information deleted));33.7915174825175;-84.1875181818182
