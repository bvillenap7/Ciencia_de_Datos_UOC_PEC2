Sounds, House Compression, Electrical Activity.;2013-08-22 03:00:00;1;Soungs, House Compression, Electrical Activity Very Odd sound awoke me, sky outside seemed lighter.   I am prior service and use too and know the sounds of aircraft and helicopters in area due to the close proximity of Ft. Stewart.  Felt like house was pressurized, dogs barking.   Laptop though top was closed emanated sounds from last video viewed.   About 15 minutes later satellite TV went on and then off.   Very unsettled...did not get up too look outside.  Was unsettled by event.   I felt strong urge in the morning to report event.  If it starts to happen again I will go out with my video recorder.;31.848;-81.6019999999999
