After 15 minutes they flew off and could no longer see them in the sky.   At exactly 6:22 P.M I looked into the sky, and to my left I saw not one but two very bright disc shaped craft flying faster then anything iv ever seen in our skies one on top of the other, whitish in color.  They were flying in what looked like the direction of the military base close by my house.   These craft stopped in mid air, hovered for just a moment then started flying back into the opposite direction were they originally came from.  After three seconds the craft on top flew in front of there craft below.  The second craft admitted a flash of light twice then both craft vanished into thin air.  I never took my eyes off of them the entire time.   Once they vanished I saw a jet fly directly into the same path were the two crafts vanished.  I remember seeing the two crafts flying in a very odd manner.  They were not fly straight like a plain or jet would, they flew in a very fast circular motion.   I have never seen anything quite like this before.  I now am a firm believer that there things in our skies that we canâ€™t explain.
