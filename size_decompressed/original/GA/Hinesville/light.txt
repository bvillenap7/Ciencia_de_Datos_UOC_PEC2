Strange light in the sky near Hinesville, GA;2012-04-23 22:00:00;30 mins;Strange light in the sky near Hinesville, GA Monday night, I stepped out to my back yard to find the strange light in the sky I had seen the night before.  Although I stay near an Army Post, I don't believe it was anything military. When I looked into the direction into which I had seen the light before, I saw nothing but stars, until I noticed one that looked out of place.  I continued to walk further into my back yard and the light I thought that was a star began to get brighter.  Soon it was a really bright orb of light hovering and If I looked at it closely it was making small movements up, side to side, and even small circles.  The light began to dim and fade till it was gone, then it would begin to appear and get brighter than the other stars around it. It continued to this for 5 or 6 times then remained solid in the sky.  No flickering lights were visible, just a change of color from white to a dim yellow and back to white.  Partner and roomate also witness the scene.;31.848;-81.6019999999999

I witnessed a bright orange/reddish light low on the horizon approaching from the East at what seemed a high rate of speed. I kept listening for the sound of a plane or chopper but as the light got brighter (closer, it seemed) it began to seem to slow. when almost directly overhead it veered toward the north and the light slowly dissipated as if gaining altitude and disappearing as it would if traveling very fast away from Earth...;31.848;-81.6019999999999
