I saw a light.  Too big and bright for a star. Too low to be a star. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2020-02-22 19:22:00;20 minutes;I saw a light. Too big and bright for a star. Too low to be a star. A plane went by lower so I could see it was hovering but moving slightly.  I watched for 20min and could make out distinct lights on the arms like a drone.  Only it was too large to be a drone. It was big like the plane.I took video it just looks like a bright light.;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314
