I know I was 4, and that month we had a eclipse, I think the same day, or day after I was in the woods with friends playing. Well, all of a sudden a light came down upon me, and a blonde blue eyes girl came down, and said she was my guardian and I was about to face bad times and to stay strong.  I had no idea she knew. And I went throught some things I won't say here. I have thought about this day since and have always looked up.  She said I was different. I'm RH- and have flash backs of that day. I've caught orbs of light on my home cameras lately. Something told me to research ufo sightings for the area and there are some very close by. plus the eclipse. Crazy....;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314

We were going back home after going to the local video store when I looked up and noticed lights in the sky. The lights were very odd. There were between 6 and 8 lights. At one time it seemed 3 lights in a row, a small break, and three more lights in a row. they were very parallel with each other. i showed them to my wife, who at first just thought it was a plane, but I pointed out that even one of the lights were to bright to be a plane. We saw them all the way down our local highway, and kept track of them when we turned right onto a side road. At that time it disappeared. We looked around into the entire  sky and found nothing.  We went into our house and told our parents about the encounter and kinda pushed it aside until it was reported today that more people witnessed the event and it was being investigated. When I saw the pictures of the UFO over New Mexico today, the pictures seemed very familiar to what My wife and I saw in broad daylight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Glowing green orb above the Moon in a picture;2009-08-26 19:45:00;1 second;Glowing green orb above the Moon in a picture Thunderstorms had been rolling toward Georgia and my girlfriend took a picture of a cloud that she thought was pretty. We both take pictures of clouds often. She sent me the picture via text message and I flipped out. In the picture you can see a bright street light, some street lights around the bottom of the picture, the Moon half covered by a cloud and a glowing green orb above and to the right of the moon.;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314
Observed a red light in the sky dodge out of the way of a commercial jet.;2016-05-09 20:00:00;5-8 minutes;Observed a red light in the sky dodge out of the way of a commercial jet. I was outside in my back yard around 8:00 pm.  It was at dusk and the sun was almost fully set.  I noticed a red light high up in the sky a ways from my home.  It then moved towards the direction of my house.  It seemed to float or hover a little then move slowly, then hover, then move again towards my house.  The light I saw was red, and didn't flash.   At first I thought it was a helicopter, but it made no noise and the light did not flash like a helicopter would.  I did see the light slowly change from red to a blueish-green color and then back to red again.  I then saw that a commercial jet was heading right for the light.   The light hovered for a while until it almost looked as if the jet and the light were going to crash, and the light moved out of the way of the jet.  The light then moved further away from my home until it lowered and went behind a line of trees and out of sight.;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314

It stayed stationary for over 15 minutes and then started to slowly move down between the trees.   It started moving when a smaller one hovered above it and eventually lined up perpendicular to the earth right above it in a straight line.  It was fascinating.   The other small one flew overhead and we could see the lights in a triangle when it got closer.  It was moving WAY to fast to be a plane of any kind and way to far away to be a drone.;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314
Bright light, flying way to low to be a plane or helicopter, bright light, soft humming sound;2020-01-03 03:00:00;2 min;Bright light, flying way to low to be a plane or helicopter, bright light, soft humming sound Object moving slow above the trees.  Could not make out shape but it was moving slow and the light was bright and seems to be moving in a way you would if you scanned something.  The light brightened the room. You could hear a humming sound. Kept flying slow and you could hear the humming go over the house.;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314

The light was so bright that it literally went into our bedroom at night and made it difficult to sleep. We could see the light through;2020-11-23 01:30:00;40 minutes;The light was so bright that it literally went into our bedroom at night and made it difficult to sleep. We could see the light through the trees and what made it so unusual was the fact that the light seemed to be as bright as a star itself. It was way too low to be a star or plane and just stayed in one spot. We actually, after much debate on what it could be and all things being illogical, decided to hop in the car and see if we could get closer. (Yes, we literally became the people in the movies that you scream at “why would you do that???”) We were able to find the light on a backroad. It was weird because the light was so so bright and we were theoretically “closer” to it, but we really weren’t. The only way it wouldn’t be closer is if it moved (but I wasn’t thinking about it at the time) I have to admit, I got a little nervous. I honestly felt like the light has a “presence” to it. And it was a very unexpected feeling since up until that moment I stil! l felt like it could be a bright fog light or something. We then drove in another direction to try to see if we could get closer. And finally went home and the light was completely gone from view - when it literally lit up our whole room in the beginning. Super weird. I didn’t think to take pictures, hadn’t crossed my mind. I actually looked up a couple of sites just to see if anyone else saw it.;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314
