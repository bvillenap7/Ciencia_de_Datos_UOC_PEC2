saw a triangular glowing light pattern;2004-06-03 20:40:00;45 sec;saw a triangular glowing light pattern at 840 pm i noticed a glowing shape in the sky higher than airlines fly, it stood out because it was obviously different than satellites on the horison, it was obviuos in the evening sky. it caught my attention as it was passing by the window, i took the screen off and filmed it, i couldnt get in clear but i saw three rectiangular light patterns and then i thought that this is reportable, it doesent look anything like a commercial or usual airplane. maybe it was the iss, passing over, and then i thought the shuttle but from what ive read the shuttle isnt up there anymore, so i saw a weird thing...i have a few pics the close ups are blurry...could be the iss or something like the shuttle. i tried to get a good pic but the zoom blurred it.
