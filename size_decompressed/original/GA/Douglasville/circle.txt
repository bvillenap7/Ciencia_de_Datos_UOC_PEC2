I observed an extremely bright object sitting stationary and low in the sky.;2016-10-12 20:35:00;22 minutes;I observed an extremely bright object sitting stationary and low in the sky. I was driving home from church on 10-12-16 and I called my sister at 8:18 pm and as I was talking to her, I noticed an extremely bright light sitting low in the sky that wasn’t moving.  It was so bright that I mentioned it to my sister.  I live near an airport but this definitely wasn’t a plane because it was stationary and there were many planes flying to and from the airport above the object.  This object was incredibly bright and low in the sky.  There were no sounds coming from it.   As I was approaching my house, I got off the phone with my sister and continued to look at the object to make sure it wasn’t something else.  I a brightly lit aircraft with three bright lights approach the object from the right side then it flew away but the object remained stationary in the sky and another of the same type of aircraft approached it from a lower angle and then it flew away but again the object remained stationary.   I attempted to film the object as I was driving but! I didn’t push record and I needed to turn around and go back to higher ground due to the fact that I lost sight of the object due to tree cover.  I found a place to safely pull my car over and film the object properly and I got about 57 seconds of it before it dimmed slightly and flew slowly away to my right.  The time stamp on the video is 8:35 pm.;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314
