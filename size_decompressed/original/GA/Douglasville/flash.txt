Flash of light of Unknown Origin.;2014-08-23 11:30:00;Seconds;Flash of light of Unknown Origin. While sitting on our back porch my wife and I both observed a flash of light that appeared in the sky.  It lit up the entire woods behind our house.  It seemed like an electrical burst, like something out of a movie.  It was a clear night and there were no clouds for it to be lightning.  We did not hear any cars in the area.  We live in a quiet area so we would have known if a car had driven by.   The flash was way too bright to be a light from a plane.  It was like a large electric burst literally happened 20-50 feet over the top of our house.   There was no sound at all. So this is probably not important but my cat is freaking out right now.  It was sitting outside with us when this happened.;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314
