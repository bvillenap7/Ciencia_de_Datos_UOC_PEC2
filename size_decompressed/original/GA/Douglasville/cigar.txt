With me working on military aircraft while in the Navy I have never seen anything like this.  Bright lights cigar shaped object hovering over tree line.   I showed my best friend and that's when we say it  start dropping rapidly to the ground, before disappearing behind treeline on I-20 east near exit 34.  I am still baffled alone with my friend.hope to find some kind of explanation.   This isn't my first Ufo sighting.;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314
