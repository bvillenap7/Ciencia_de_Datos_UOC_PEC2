observed a daylight star/cannister shaped object;2003-05-28 17:43:00;10 sec;observed a daylight star/cannister shaped object i was watching tv in my bedroom and noticed a daylight star appear in the sky outside the window. it appeared spherical and silver. i grabbed my 8mm camcorder and filmed a few seconds of it. i used the 560x zoom to see what it was. it appeared to be an illuminated square/cannister type object with black lines on each side. it appeared to be floating by at approx 800-1000ft altitude, no sound or chemtrail, and on tape it doesnt resemble any mylar type balloon. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) peter, im using a webtv system and i have no way of e-mailing photos, or uploading or downloading anything. since i dont have a computer i can't even print stills from my camcorder. ill be glad to send you the original tape (8mm) and you can print from it you can.  if you do can, can you send the stills back to me, along with the original tape. feel free to make all the copies you want  of the tape for yourself or others. i will have to mail it usps an i will pay the shipping on it if you can do the same on return.  on the tape the reported object can be clearly seen and in focus. You can see it best by pausing the tape or slow playing it and pause it. Its definately not a plane or anthing else i can describe. if you can analyze it and determine what it is please let me know. also i noticed the report from nashville, tn on 6/2 of a glowing square or rectangle object, the object i filmed appeared the same, and can be seen on the tape   on the tape there is another video i filmed back in march of another bright star like object at night (a bright non-blinking light)  moving across the sky and it crosses paths with a commercial airliner, very close. i didnt report that because theres no way i have of telling weather or not  it was a plane with just one non blnking light on it,  but if it was a plane it was a close near miss, to close to be normal.   if this plan is ok with you e-mail me and  i will send it to you via  regular mail  asap.

whitish cylinder shaped object stationary and wobbling;2007-02-05 17:45:00;one minute;whitish cylinder shaped object stationary and wobbling i was entering a grocery store and noticed something stationary in the sky, i looked up and saw something shaped like a cylinder whitish in color and slighlty wobbling. i watched it for a minute and could clearly see that it did not have wings or propellers.  there were commercial airliners flying near by and even several jets flying above it leaving vapor trails, the object i saw was about the same altitude as the commercial air traffic. the size from my view point was about the 1/4 size of a dime at arms length. no sound or any external features could be seen only a whitish cylinder shape.  i entered the store to shop and when i came out about 10 min later it was gone.;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314
Cylinder shaped craft fly's through opening in clouds.;2016-10-07 13:00:00;3 seconds;Cylinder shaped craft fly's through opening in clouds. While driving along at about 30 mph on a two lane black top, I looked up at the clouds that were associated with hurricane Mathew.  It was completely overcast except for one small hole that I could see blue sky.  A cylinder shaped craft that was the color of the clouds flew through the opening.  No wings, no tail.  It had vertical lines on the front and back and a horizontal line or lines across the top third of the craft.  I would estimate it to be about 3,000 ft off the ground and about 200 feet long.;33.7106486842105;-84.7475210526314
