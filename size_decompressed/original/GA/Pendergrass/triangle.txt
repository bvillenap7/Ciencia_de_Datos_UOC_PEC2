Triangular mass over Jackson County;2007-04-15 18:30:00;2-3 minutes;Trianguar mass over Jackson County Earlier this year me and my mother were in a car, i was driving her home from a meeting. It was almost totally dark when i looked up into the clouds and saw a light, and then two more in the shape of a triangle. I stopped the car (we were on a private dirt road) and got out. At first i thought i was just some airplanes or helicopters, but as i looked the clouds got a little less thick and i saw it was a huge triangular mass, it looked like a ship, about a mile in each direction. it was moving so fast that i didnt have enough time to take a picture, but it sure creeped me and my mom out.
