My husband and I saw an object in the sky.  It appeared to be a light just hovering in the sky.  It looked kind of like a teardrop.  It was just sitting there.  Then it zoomed upwards and sat for a few seconds and then disappeared.   There were several jets that appeared to be headed towards it.  I saw the same thing about a month ago.;34.9556;-85.2417
