At approximately 9pm, what at first seemed to be a star, started moving across the sky from east to north.  It's light was solid and it would seem to pulse very slowly, dimming in and out for about 15 seconds.  Then it disappeared.  The next three lights came from the west traveling north-east.  Another thing that was very strange is that these lights would change flight patterns and would zig-zag.  These lights acted the very same way.  They were traveling much faster than a passenger plane.  They looked like the brightest stars in the sky but after you looked at them for a couple of seconds, they would begin to move at a high rate of speed to another section in the sky.;34.9556;-85.2417
