Ring of lights hovering and rotating in one spot.;2020-02-21 21:00:00;Hour;Ring of lights hovering and rotating in one spot. Bright light in the sky got my attention.  Was very bright and too low to be a star.  Watched a small plane fly above it.  With binoculars it looked like a circle of lights, kind of spinning or moving around in all directions, pulsating maybe....was hard to tell.  Like how a jellyfish propels itself...looked like that!  But without the binoculars it looked still.  I took some photos, but just shows the bright dot.  I quit watching after about and hour and when I came back out it was gone.;34.4825;-85.3298
