Low flying red-orange lights.;2015-02-02 21:15:00;8 minutes;Low flying red-orange lights. The night was crystal clear with not a cloud in the sky.  It was the night before a full moon, so the reflected light off the moon illuminated the yard, etc., giving it a twilight feel.   At approximately 9:15 PM, I observed two large, red-orange sparkling lights, very slowly approaching our home from above the tree line.  (We have woods behind our home, but without the leaves on them it is possible to see for quite a distance into them.)  My husband and I immediately went outside into our backyard.  We observed a third red-orange light approaching behind the first two.  They were large, completely silent, and moving very slowly.  No visible structures were visible, just light.   Within a few minutes, a fourth red-orange light approached following in the same path as the first three.   They continued to very slowly progress over the tree line and off into the distance.   Also, our dog, still inside, barked relentlessly at the lights.;34.1133187096774;-84.5246141935483

3 bright white flying objects in a clear blue sky;2020-11-17 15:00:00;15 seconds;3 bright white flying objects in a clear blue sky I was speaking to my husband on the phone, driving south-bound, when I suddenly noticed 3 bright white flying objects high in the north eastern part of a clear blue sky.   When I first saw the objects I thought that they were meteors headed towards the earth.  On closer observation, 2 of the objects were flying horizontal while a third separate object underneath them seemed to be free falling towards the ground.  After a few seconds, I quickly ended the call and I took a few photos of the objects on my Android. The objects fell out of my view behind the tree line located to the east of the road.  I believe the objects were far from me due to the lack of definition.;34.1133187096774;-84.5246141935483
