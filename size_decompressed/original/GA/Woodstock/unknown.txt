It only lasted seconds.  It scared me so badly that I called a friend to comfort me.   When I realized the world hadn't ended, I was okay, but very puzzled as to what had happened.  The next day around 2:30 I went outside to mow the lawn. (and prove to myself I wasn,t scared to go out side.)  I started at the left front of house, going towards the woods.  When I came close to the woods ,I noticed a burnt place in the yard. I turned off the mower to investigate more closely.  I was about 12 to 15 inches in diameter, perfectly round, not out of line anywhere and about 10 to 15 feet wide and all the grass in the middle was squished down flat, like a heavy wieght had been on it.  My dog went crazy when he came over to see what I was looking at.  Jumping back and forth at it and yipping high, shrill ,barks over and over.  So I tied him on the other side of the house.  The burnt grass was still in form.  I thot someone was playing a joke on me.  So I questioned my nieghbor on the hill across the road, to see if she had heard or seen anything.  She said no. But, you could see the burnt circle perfectly from her porch.  And it was perfect.  I showed the circle to my brother, my cousin and acouple of friends, and my husband at the time.  My husband and brother both knew of the incident the day before because I told them all about it at supper the night before, so we were all trying to put two and two together.   As summer progressed  the burnt area turned brown. Then these mushrooms, and only mushrooms started growing in the circle. They grew fast,and extremly large, until they just burst open.  Then they disentigrated and toward the end of summer the grass started growing back.  It grew darker, thicker, faster, and taller than the rest of the grass in the yard.  That winter it snowed, and that circle of grass still grew tall through the snow.  You could see that circle for a few years after a! lso, but has finally faded away. Same as above. ((NUFORC Note:  We have revised this report.  We assume that the event occurred during daylight hours, so we have amended the time of the incident to reflect that fact.

Bright flashing light through the trees. Timing it has shown it goes off every 39-41 seconds.  Airplanes also heard above.;2017-08-14 22:00:00;3 hours;Bright flashing light through the trees.  Timing it has shown it goes off every 39-41 seconds. Airplanes also heard above Standing in the driveway with my girlfriend talking and smoking a cigarette when we look up through the tree line and see a bright flash of light.  Just thinking it was lightning we ignored it, until I saw it 3 more times.   We stayed outside for another hour until we went to get her mom.  When we told her about it and she saw it she tried to pass it off as lightning but there are no clouds in the sky. She then told us that she saw the light when she was dropping s friend off 2 hours earlier. The light is in the same spot not moving just continuesly flashing consistently at 39-41 seconds per flash.   We also noticed that there was an abnormal number of planes out.  We started counting and counted 6 planes in 5 minutes all in the direction of the object and one flying low directly overhead.;34.1133187096774;-84.5246141935483
