Glowing orbs mistaken for falling stars;2013-03-15 20:00:00;3-4 minutes;Glowing orbs mistaken for falling stars I was taking my dog out for the evening.  As I was going out toward the front yard I noticed what looked like a falling star shoot across my neighbors skyline.  The flight path of the object went from my neighbors house across the street over my house. Shortly after sighting the first falling star I noticed another one right behind it and on the same flight path. I began to focus more now on the falling stars and realized these were not falling stars but rather glowing orbs that were in full motion. I was now fixated on the orbs trying to identify what exactly I was observing.  Four more additional orbs followed along the same flight path (similar to a funeral precession) behind the initial two.  The objects were moving at steady cruising speed. The objects could be best described as soft fireballs with a diffused type glow.  The orbs were completely silent (no engine noise) and all uniform in shape and size.  There was typical source of identification (i.e.red/green running lights that are common on commercial aircraft). I can't say for sure that this was an E.T sighting.  However, I can say with certainty is that the objects weren't commercial air craft nor do I believe this was a natural phenomenon (I.e. meteor or falling star) due to the fact that the objects were all on the same exact flight path.;34.1133187096774;-84.5246141935483
