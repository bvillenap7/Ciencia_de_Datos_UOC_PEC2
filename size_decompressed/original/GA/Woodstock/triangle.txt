Large Craft Low Altitude No Sound  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;2005-11-02 17:00:00;10 seconds;Large Craft Low Altitude No Sound   I have already reported this to a MUFON field investigator and was interviewed at the location of the sighting. I think of this constantly. I was having dinner at a Restaurant located in Woodstock, Georgia on 92 Highway with my wife and stepson. After dinner we walked out to my vehicle when my stepson (age 9 at the time) pointed skyward directly above us and asked me what that thing was. I looked up, as did my wife, and saw a large craft directly above us flying at a low altitude. It was moving east along Highway 92. It was not making a sound and was in a perfect black triangle with orb type lights on each angle of the triangle. It was moving very slow. It was heavy overcast that evening and it moved in and out of the clouds. We watched it until it left view. I had no idea what it was, my reaction was one of puzzlement and did not feel in fear of it. I initially thought it was a government craft since a major AFB was nearby. When we got home, my wife looked up information about it on the internet and it was the same craft that has been sighted in Belgium and Phoenix, AZ. After the interview with MUFON, I was given information that what I had seen was not a government craft. After explaining it's size in relation to my hand at arm's length, I was told it was a mile long. I was also told that someone else reported the same thing and the other person was across 92 HWY in a parking lot. have not experienced any sort of trauma as a result of this experience. The MUFON investigator said it was still possible. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.1133187096774;-84.5246141935483
Odd craft in Georgia;2005-11-22 23:15:00;5 minutes;Odd craft in Georgia My friend and I were out by a local pond talking when we saw an odd light in the sky.  At first I thought it was an aircraft, but it began to change speed and altitude too rapidly for conventional aircraft.  My friend started get scared, but I told him it had to be an airplane.  Soon it was obvious that the ship was actually 2 ships when they split off about 1000 feet above us.  When it started to descend we ran as fast as we could go back to the road.  We could see the lights for about 2 more minutes, and then they shot strait up and disappeared.  As the crafts disappeared it was obvious there were some military sized jets in teh area, but we could not tell if they were tracking the craft.;34.1133187096774;-84.5246141935483

I figured maybe its a plane that going to the small airport near me and is about to land.  The noise was too loud for it to be a small plane, and i figured if it is a commercial plane it is a little far away from the main airport for it to be this low.   So, I stepped out of the garage out of curiosity, and saw a plane that was a triangular shape.  It had lights on the bottom of the plane and i figured that was weird.  I had never seen a plane so lit up at the bottom, let alone triangular.  I saw it for about a good 15 second, then it just disappeared.  That's the thing about it too, I'm not a plane expert, but if the plane was that low.  I figure its getting close to landing but the speed was pretty fast.;34.1133187096774;-84.5246141935483
