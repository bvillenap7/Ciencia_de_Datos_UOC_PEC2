Dark circular low flying object near Woodstock Ga;1989-03-15 23:30:00;10 seconds;Dark circular low flying object near Woodstock Ga Driving North on I-575, saw a circular object moving eastbound.  The object appeared just over the tree line, moved in a straight line over the interstate and then disappeared over the trees on the Eastern side of the interstate.  Speed of object unknown, but as it was low flying, the object seemed to have moved faster than an airplane would have.  It was moving slowly enough that I could tell it had a circular outline as the outline appeared darker than the night sky.  Object made no noise as it moved.  Object also had three lights in an inverted triangular pattern on it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));34.1133187096774;-84.5246141935483
2 sphere like objects over Georgia tonight.  ((anonymous report));2018-06-25 21:03:00;3-5 minutes;2 sphere like objects over Georgia tonight. While taking pictures of a complete rainbow, I started zooming and suddenly I noticed two floating sphere like objects.  After making the zoom, they seemed to have like an energy source surrounding them. I showed it to my daughters and immediately I tried to take a video but when I was focusing, they suddenly vanished.;34.1133187096774;-84.5246141935483
