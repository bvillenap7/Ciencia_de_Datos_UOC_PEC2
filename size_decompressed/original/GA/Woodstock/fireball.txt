There were at least nine, no  more than 12 balls of fire in the sky.  They didn't appear to be moving.  They didn't seem to be any type  of aircraft that was flying they literally looked like balls of fire, like a constellation.   When I got to my car they were gone.  I tried to take pictures with my cell phone, but was unable to because it was dark and the phone couldn't focus.;34.1133187096774;-84.5246141935483
