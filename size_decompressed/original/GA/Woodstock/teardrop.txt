Great design for travel and being seen clearly.;2003-11-11 16:00:00;30 mins;Great design for travel and being seen clearly. Witnessed an object flying woth No Noise. The craft was a combination of a barrel and teardrop shape. Several colors shining very bright. The craft climbed at a very slow rate. Slower than any plane with out stalling in flight. This craft had very distintive colors red, blue, white, yellow or amber. The reason I noticed it was the lights where shining so bright and the absences of sound. I could hear birds calling and also see other commercial aircraft in the same area just at much higher elevation. At first the craft was at tree top elevation. I was talking on the phone at the time of the sighting and noticed a failure in the cordless phone to a cellular connection. This craft elevated at a very gradual rate at the same angle of acent about 75 degrees. This craft was not the average. I have lived on several Military Bases around the World and this was byfar the best design I have seen to date. This would include any Stelth 111 or even the SR-71. The ability to see this craft for at least a half an hour climbing at a steady rate up wards and still be able to see the changing colors of the lights in full day light at a distance of some 50,000 feet is incredible. I gage my distances by the tree top elevation when I first saw it to the elevation I saw the Commercial Aircraft to the elevation of the High Cerrious Clouds it went up into.
