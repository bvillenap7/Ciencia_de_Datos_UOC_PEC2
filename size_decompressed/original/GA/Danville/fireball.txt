Bright green fireball seen overhead and headed towards woodline no crash, whistle, or bang heard.;2009-01-15 21:00:00;-5 seconds;Bright green fireball seen overhead and headed towards woodline no crash, whistle, or bang heard. I was walking outside in my back yard to feed my dog when I saw a bright green object go over the trees. It resembled a comet or flare, but it was green. The object had the intensity of a welding torch, but did not burn my eyes the tail behind was, as I stated earlier, a bright turquoise-green. I saw it out of the corner of my eye and watched it go over the tree tops. There was no boom, there was no whistle or pop, these led me to believe it was not a firework or bottle rocket. In a possible unrelated event, a few minutes later, a plane came flying over from the horizon. All that were visible were the lights on it, but rather than flashing like a normal military or commercial plane, it flashed similarly to that of a police car. I didn't stick around to see where it was headed, as it was cold, so I went into the house. My house is about 25 to 30 miles away from an air force base, but in the 10 years we've lived here, I've never seen anything like the green light.
