2 bright ref lights blinking one after the other hovering and changing form.  ((anonymous report));2018-12-11 19:15:00;20 minutes;2 bright ref lights blinking one after the other hovering and changing form I was driving out of the Vidalia Georgia city limits headed towards Montgomery County, Georgia, when I saw two red lights in the night sky, one light was higher almost like it was at a 45 degree angle.  The left light blinked first and then the right light in perfect harmony.  As I kept driving it was in the exact same spot at a hover, it changed to the lights being horizontal to each other and still the lights blinked left to right.   I kept driving for another 15 miles and still could see it but this time it was moving in a westward direction maintaining the same blinking pattern.  No towers are in that area. I heard no sound as when I first spotted it, if it was a jet I wouldâ€™ve heard it, but heard nothing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
