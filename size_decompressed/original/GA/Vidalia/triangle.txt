As my friend and I were driving we noticed a cluster of orangeish lights hovering over a field (they kinda looked like old street lights)  They were about 50 feet off of the ground and stayed there for a few minutes.  They disappeared then reappeared just a mile or two away over another field. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));32.1948;-82.404
