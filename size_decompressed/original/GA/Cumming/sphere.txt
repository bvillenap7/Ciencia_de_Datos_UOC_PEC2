MUFON GEORGIA REPORT:  MUFONGA Investigation-Glowing Orb Flies Low Pass Over School Bus;2007-01-25 06:45:00;Less than 1 minute;((NUFORC Note:  WE EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO MUFON GEORGIA, AND TO ITS DIRECTOR, MR. TOM SHEETS, FOR SHARING THIS CASE WITH NUFORC.   MUFONGA Investigation-Glowing Orb Flies Low Pass Over School Bus The following described event and investigation resulted from a Georgia citizen's report filed via MUFON's CMS.  On 05Feb07, MUFONGA received the CMS report from MUFON Hqs. and launched an inquiry.  The event occurred on 25Jan07 at about 6:45AM, and involved a witness living in Forsyth County Georgia (about 40 miles NNE of Atlanta).  This writer contacted the witness and found her to be a 45YOA mother and homemaker who wished for her identity to remain confidential for the time being.  For the purpose of this report, she will be referred to only as Monserrat, as is her preference in this matter.  Witness was found to be well educated, articulate, seemed forthright, and had traveled and lived internationally during earlier periods in her life.  The witness' neighborhood is upscale suburban, the area also containing small pastures, horses, a few cattle, and MANY children.  She has resided therein for about 3+ years.  After the initial conversation with Monserrat, this writer assigned Jim Clifford, a HIGHLY experienced MUFONGA investigator, to visit the event site and conduct a sit-down with the witness. Jim interviewed the witness at her home on 9Feb07.  Event---- On 25Jan07, Monserrat was going about her early morning routine, getting her children ready for school and so forth.  At about 6:45AM, she walked them out to the bus stop which is only about 20 feet from her driveway.  Some other parents had driven to the bus stop and were sitting in their vehicles up and down the block.   She put her children safely aboard and turned to go back to the house.  At this time, the witness noticed what she initially THOUGHT was a tossed ball fly over the bus.  She reacted as most people do when something is tossed, a quick awareness and focus on what has been tossed.  She observed a SOFTBALL SIZED ORB, GLOWING MUCH LIKE AN EMBER FROM A FIRE, SILENTLY FLY OVER THE BUS ABOUT 10 FEET ABOVE THE VEHICLE'S ROOF. She stated that this ORB was gliding along at about 3/4's LESS VELOCITY than a regular tossed ball. It continued on toward a neighbor's home across the street, flew OVER the roof and on toward a wooded treeline behind.  During the progress of this slow flight, the ORB grew smaller and smaller, from SOFTBALL SIZE, to about TENNIS BALL SIZE until it VANISHED.  The witness was very surprised, and unfortunately, the other parents did not make the same observation due to sitting in their vehicles.  After returning to the house, the witness tried to go on with her normal morning chores, but found herself uncharacteristically fatigued.  She fell into bed and slept soundly for about 4  hours (this extended morning nap being TOTALLY out of character).  She was awakened by the sound of LOW FLYING HELICOPTERS, so low that she indicated the window panes were rattling.  Adding that this had NEVER happened before during their years in the neighborhood, saying there were no military or similar aviation facilities nearby.  Later that evening, at about 8:00PM, she was preparing for her children's next school day and happened to see a strange light outside and heard what sounded like a tractor in the rear......where no light and no tractor should be.  During this period she heard distant helicopter sounds, and then the low, window rattling fly-over again.  After contemplating all that had occurred, she felt that what she had observed was a living, organic, intelligent entity of some sort, and perhaps the government had also picked up on it.  During his visit to the scene, FI Clifford routinely checked the area and orb's flight path with an EM Field Tester and compass......no unusual readings were noted.   He found nothing else that could be related to the event.  Jim is a retired 20+ years veteran of the U.S. Navy and a communications specialist.  He later checked the various military authorities that might dispatch helo flights into the Forsyth area......no source for the helos was found.  The witness recounted her original statement at least three times during this investigation, once to this writer, once to Jim Clifford, and once to the MUFONGA metro staff at a meeting.......consistent throughout, credibility throughout.  Jim Clifford classified this event  as an Unknown in MUFON's CMS.  If any other Forsyth County citizen(s) has observed anything similar on or about 25Jan07, or at any other time, please do the following  1) Fill out the NUFORC report form as described on this site  2) Next go to www.mufon.com and file a report on the CMS  3) Last, contact me here at www.mufonofga1@yahoo.com.

Orange round object moving horizontally and silently over my house.;2008-07-14 21:29:00;2 minutes;Orange round object moving horizontally and silently over my house. I was taking out the garbage Monday night (7-14-08) at about 9:30 PM and was half way down the driveway and saw an orange glowing object which was circular in shape. It was moving silently and  horizontally  at about  10 to 15 MPH. It was heading south and  went over my house at a height of about 30 Feet above the peak  of my two story  roof line. I  ran inside my house and took my wife outside on the back deck of our house to see the object  which was going over our house.  The object continued on and went over the trees in our backyard .  I ran out in the backyard to get a better look.  As the object went over the trees it looked like it turned into a liquid state / form which  looked like an orange waterfall and disappeared.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669

Sphere looking object with extremely bright lights and one blue light, none of them blinking, hovering over Ga. 400, exits 12-13.;2015-01-25 21:03:00;2 minutes;Sphere looking object with extremely bright lights and one blue light, none of them blinking, hovering over Ga. 400, exits 12-13. My daughters and I were heading home from church, northbound on 400 around 9:00pm, between exits 12 and 13, just past the Siemens.  I spotted a bright object in the sky up ahead and as we were talking, I kept noticing the object wasn't moving and was getting closer, meaning we were moving and the object wasn't. I finally said to my daughters, Look at that thing in the sky.  Neither of them believed and didn't look up...I am always pulling jokes on them and being silly.  One of my daughters said it was probably a star, sarcastically, but the night sky was completely overcast...not a star in the sky.  The back drop was an orange tint to the skyline. When I finally said it again, we were almost under it and my curiosity grew when I didn't see a pole anywhere in site.  I was thinking it was one of those towers with brinking lights, only they weren't blinking.  As we got right under the object, my other daughter finally looked out the window and almost cussed, saying, Holy.....oh my gosh dad!!!!   She rolled the window down and started making out what she was seeing.  She said it was a longer shaped sphere, no wings, no propellers, about 300-400 feet in the air.  There were 2 extremely bright lights on either side of the object and a blue lights that looked like it was underneath or coming from inside.  It hovered, completely motionless as we passed by....my other daughter wanted to see it but the other daughters head and body were in the way.   I told her to look out the back window and that's when they both said it was gone.... I pulled off of exit 13 and drove back down to exit 12 to see if we could see it again and unfortunately, it was gone. I am posting this because I don't believe in aliens, but I can tell you that I have no idea what we just saw, and want some answers.  Just the fact that I am posting this on this site is enough for me to ask, what the heck was that?;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
I emailed local newspaper....copied and paste what I emailed paper.;2020-03-01 21:00:00;8 minutes;I emailed local newspaper....copied and paste what I emailed paper. So far newspaper has not responded to my email.  I do want to clarify what the ball/sphere looked like.  A very bright orange and it looked like a ball of Fire...the fire was not effected by the travel of the sphere.  It looked like what you would imagine the sun looking like setting stationary.  The flames was not effected by the object moving....it did not have a tail.  I estimate it was traveling between 25 - 30mph.  (Balls seemed to be larger than a beach ball and a bit smaller than the circumference if a hula hoop.  Extremely bright orange. Below is what I emailed newspaper... I’m just curious....Did anyone report 3 bright orange lights flying north between Kelly Mill and post road?  I feel awkward asking but my curiosity has gotten the best of me.  I believe it was around 9 last night and I was in backyard with my dog.  I saw what appeared to be a very bright orange ball which looked like a flickering orange flame shooting from the ball.  There was cloud cover last night, the bright orange ball flew beneath clouds and seemed to be about 20 - 25 feet above my neighbors roof flying at a good speed north.  I stood there for a couple of minutes trying to make sense of what I saw.  I then grabbed my husband and went to the front of house and saw 3 of these balls....one farther ahead and two which were closer together.  They were not losing altitude but seemed to be going higher yet still below clouds.  If it were drones all three must have had spontaneous combustion.  The one that flew over neighbors house had no sound at all.  I’ve been around drones! and they have a low buzz sound.  I’m ruling out Chinese lanterns....there was no wind and they were following each other at a pretty good pace.  I thought about military jets but these were below clouds, no sound and did not have the speed of a jet.   I’m stumped.  Just curious if you had any reports.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
