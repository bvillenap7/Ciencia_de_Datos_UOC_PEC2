Low flying, sparkling, cigar shaped, wingless, silver object silently moving through northern GA sky.;2012-10-25 09:35:00;1 minute;Low flying, sparkling, cigar shaped, wingless, silver object silently moving through northern GA sky. October 25, 2012   This morning I was out on the deck behind our house.  I looked up toward the top of a tree that was changing colors in the autumn and noticed a fairly low flying silver object that I first took for an airplane, since it had the sleek, cigar shape of an airplane’s fuselage.  Normally I wouldn’t have even noticed it, because it made no noise at all. I had my glasses on, so I was able to see it well. I watched as it soundlessly glided in a southern direction through the sky, and I tried to identify whether it was a larger jet that perhaps had taken off from the airport, or a smaller aircraft.  It had no contrail, so I looked for its wings and to my surprise it had none.  It either greatly sparkled in the sun, or was emitting fluctuating bright light. I saw no windows on the object.  Then, I got concerned thinking it might be either a large missile directed at some point in the USA or a UFO. As it headed out of sight, I began to experience a strong feeling of dizziness, unbalance, and a general feeling of malaise which passed in several minutes after coming indoors.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
