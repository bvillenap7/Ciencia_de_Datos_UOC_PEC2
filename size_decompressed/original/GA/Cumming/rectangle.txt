We just saw a very bright light, but it wasn't a plane or anything like that.  It wasn't a star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?

At first we didn't think it was moving, in fact it looked stationary, but finally it started to move away from us. It was going northwest.   I took pictures of it and when I blew up the picture it looked huge.  It was brighter then any star, street light or anything I have ever seen in the sky.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
