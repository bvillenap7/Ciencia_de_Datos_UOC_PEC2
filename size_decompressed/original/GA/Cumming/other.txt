Tumbling dot from west horizon to east, blinking as it reflected the sun.;2016-07-27 21:45:00;1 minute;Tumbling dot from west horizon to east, blinking as it reflected the sun. While standing in my driveway, I observed a blinking dot moving eastward from the western horizon at a very high altitude (like an airliner).  But it was moving much faster than an airliner would appear at that altitude and slower than meteor streak. (I have observed the ISS previously, and this was not that - it was faster.)   The blinking continued as it crossed, from west to east.  As it got closer to directly overhead the blinking became dimmer and I had the impression that the object was not blinking as I originally thought, but rather tumbling and reflecting, perhaps, the recently set sun.  Shortly after it passed directly overhead, the blinking faded out completely (ruling out an airliner).  I stood for several minutes afterward to listen for the following sound of an airliner.  But there was none.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
