Saw a flash of light and figure in my home. My dog was affected and had to be put down.;2018-05-06 01:00:00;45+;Saw a flash of light and figure in my home. My dog was affected and had to be put down. I was out for a girl's night with my friend, we came back in an uber around 1:00 AM.  We pulled up to my driveway and as we were getting out I saw a bright orange flash of light fly over my house.   I yelled to my friend to look, and as she did, a second one flied in the same direction.  We had both had a few drinks so naturally we just played it off, even though I was slightly frazzled at this.  About a minute after this had happened, the power in my house flashed and went out.  Then I can hear my dog,  Chris barking like crazy.   Me and my friend then went inside, flashlight in hand.  Chris is standing in the doorway, teeth bared, barking like hell.  When we got in the living room, I shone the light and immediately saw a figure standing in the middle of my room.  It was person shaped but it was very skinny and tall with long arms.  I screamed so loud and my friend grabbed me and we ran outside.  Chris stopped barking sometime around this time. While we were outside (for a! round 25 minutes)  We saw the flash of light fly past in the opposite direction.  Then when we worked up enough courage to go back inside, stiletto in hand as a weapon,  The figure was no longer in my house.  I was not able to sleep that night but nothing like that has happened since.  When  got up the next morning, the power was back on.  I may have been a little drunk but both me and my friend are absolutely positive of what we saw.   After that day, Chris started to get very hostile. He would bark all day, bit me several times, and just acted crazy and nothing like the sweet dog I knew and loved.  He had to be put down yesterday after he killed a smaller neighborhood dog.  I don't know exactly why he snapped, but I'm positive it had something to do with what I saw that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
