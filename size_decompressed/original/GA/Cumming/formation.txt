Formation of lights in the sky.;2014-09-05 22:00:00;20 minutes;Formation of lights in the sky. On Friday September 5th at around 10 PM I was in my driveway when I witnessed a cluster of red or orange lights in the distant sky that were moving in a south west direction.  Some of the lights appeared to be moving in formation, one behind the other, while others at the end of the formation changed to a sideways V shape.  Still others appeared to be moving freely all over the sky.  As the lights moved across the western sky and out of view more lights could appear over the tree line. I phoned my neighbor for a witness.   He joined me and we watched this process continue for approximately 15 more minutes.  There were too many lights to count and we both estimated that there were at least 20 to 30 lights. Eventually only 1 or 2 new lights at a time joined the others and they all finally moved out of our viewing range. We discussed the sighting compared notes and both agreed that this could not have been birds, planes or helicopters.  Neither of us have ever seen anything like this.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
