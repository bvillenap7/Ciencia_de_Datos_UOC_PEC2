Looked like a traditional satellite moving overhead, around 7:15 pm EST,  but a smaller light was seen shooting out of this.  The smaller object faded from view within 4 seconds, but the main object continued on a east to west path until it was out of view.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669

A bright white light flew overhead. No blinking lights and No sound. It moved east for about a minute and then it slowly faded and was gone.  Planes fly south all the time going to hartsfield airport and I know what they look like.  Wondering if anyone else saw it? It was like a star moving across the sky and not a fireball like a shooting star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Single white light, no noise, no blinking, straight line flight path;2010-09-13 21:30:00;3-5 minutes;Single white light, no noise, no blinking, straight line flight path Saw a single white light moving across a calm night sky.  It made no noise it had no blinking lights.  It looked to be no higher than 200 feet high.   It moved in a straight line, from my point of view it didn't look like it was going any faster than 40 or 50 mph.   It flew almost directly over my house, and I could see it until the trees blocked my view.   Sighting lasted about 3 to 5 minutes.

6 red flashing lights in the sky over North GA.;2012-12-12 22:30:00;35 seconds;6 red flashing lights in the sky over North GA. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSNxQ3q6zf0&list=PL5HTb8B-sZQuavUwhG2THWoqQbGtzTRaI   Attached above is the linked video of the sighting, just in case the file is too large to send VIA Email. I was driving home and I came to a stop sign where I was going to turn left until I looked up and saw the red lights in the sky.  The altitudes were not abnormal as I would say they were actually rather low.  The were slow paced and the lighting fluctuated between the crafts.  This night was clear skies and 100% visibility.  I did have my windows down and I could not hear anything...  I assumed I would hear them with how close they were and the amount of them.  This video was shot in North Georgia.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
I witnessed a bright purple orb traveling across my neighborhood and instantly a green orb appeared and they seemed to communicate;2013-05-21 21:00:00;20 minutes;I witnessed a bright purple orb traveling across my neighborhood and instantly a green orb appeared and they seemed to communicate My 3 year old son and I were pulling in my neighborhood at about 9:25pm tonight (5/21/13) and I noticed a huge bright vibrant purple ball of light moving across the sky about a 1000 feet up (above the neighborhood), pretty high but very close to us.. My son says look a &quotfirefly&quot.. I shut off my car with windows down and no sound what so ever and no beacon lights were coming from the object.   As I watched it moving (approximately the speed of a small cessna type airplane but floating like a balloon), instantly another huge ball of light just appears in front of it (about 200 yards out) coming directly at it..  This one is bright GREEN..  Right as they are about to collide they both instantly stop in the sky at equal distance apart from each other and rotate 3 times in a perfect circle counterclockwise facing each other and then completely stop for about 10 seconds (hovering) and then they continue on side by side (the purple one slightly in front of the green one) in t! he same direction over the tree line (about 1/2 mile away).  My son and I watched for about 20 minutes as the purple one ascended and descended at a pretty fast rate (it would come up in a straight vertical line to about 1000 feet, stop, shift from side to side for about a 30 seconds to 2 minutes and then descend at about the same speed it came up) over the tree line several times while gradually changing colors (purple, red, orange, blue).. This happened 4 times over a 20 minute period. The second time that this happened, I was on the phone with my father holding my son and as the object in the distance was hovering, a bright vibrant green flash went over our head with no sound, so fast it left a green trail for a split second and disappeared as fast as it appeared (almost as fast as a lightning flash but directly over our head and heading from south to north - we were watching the other object off to our East). My son once again said &quotthat was a fast green firefly&quot  My 13ish year old neighbor walked up and as I was explaining to her what we were experiencing, the purple object ascended up from the tree line again, this time morphing vibrant colors from purple, red, orange and blue. We watched this event for approximately 2 minutes before she got a bit scared and went home. I snapped 3 VERY quick pictures (each picture was taken as fast as I could hit the picture button. Milliseconds from the each other) back to back with my iphone as the one in the distance was ascending (it was blue at this point)..  It's the cobalt blue light at the top of each picture.. I didn't notice until after I looked at my phone and zoomed in but, in the first picture, you see just a blue object. In the 2nd picture, you see the blue object but above it, a white ball swooping in with a tail or streak behind it. In the 3rd picture, you see the blue orb, no object above it but now a big white object with a mushroom shape to it below it. I could not see these with the naked eye, only after I looked closely at the photos.  The lights themselves were much larger than anything I have ever seen before (huge) and they maneuvered like nothing I have ever seen (i think ruling out planes, helicopter, remote control vehicle)..;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
Two objects that looked like stars/planets..at first were stationary then moved off independently of one another in opposite directions;2013-06-03 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;Two objects that looked like stars/planets..at first were stationary then moved off independently of one another in opposite directions My daughter works at a McDonalds that is right outside the entrance to our subdivision.  I left to pick her up from work a bit before ten p.m..   When I got to the stop sign going onto the main road (facing north), I noticed two( what I thought were) stars or planets almost  straight across in front of me in the sky above,  and well beyond, the roofs of the  houses across the street.  I turned right onto the main road, and almost immediately left into McDonald’s parking lot, and could still see the lights.  I went around the building and parked so I could watch the objects.  They were still in the same position, so I reasoned with myself they must be stars or planets.  They sat slightly diagonal from each other.  The one on the upper right was reddish (made me think of mars) and the lower left was bright whitish almost to the point of looking blue.  I just sat and looked at them, thinking how neat it was they were so bright…so I actually observed them for a few minutes.  Suddenly the white one on the lower left moved toward the west and went off or behind something…it was a measured, deliberate movement….not a “shooting off” quickly.   I looked back to the upper right one, and it went straight down and out of sight with the same deliberate motion…and I just sat there with my mouth open, looking around to see if anyone else saw it (I was alone in the parking lot), and wondered what the heck I had just seen.

Two bright oval shaped lights for an hour over Cumming night sky, in Spring 2014.;2014-04-09 20:45:00;1 hour;Two bright oval shaped lights for an hour over Cumming night sky, in Spring 2014. I went out to remove some bags from my car when I noticed a bright, dark-blue light moving through the sky from NW to NE.  It was larger than any airplane I've seen and the brightness of the light was strong enough that I still saw an impression of it when I looked away.  It was an oval-like shape of light that did not pulsate or blink, but was was constant. Soon I noticed a green object that was almost the same, but slightly smaller and flying behind the first one.  They moved quickly in their trajectory and popped in and out of sight several times, reappearing in various locations (some times the same and some times different locations).  Once, when an airplane flew over from N to S (crossing over my head), they both disappeared and then reappeared after the airplane was out of their range!    Lastly, after they thoroughly swept the sky NW to NE, they reversed direction, moving further from my vantage point towards the horizon.  They did this multiple times until they disappeared over the horizon.  The blue one, on occasion, would turn a light purple color and even a dark red.   Near their disappearance, I was able to get a good enough sight of the green one through my binoculars.  I noticed that it consisted of a green core (an orb like shape) surrounded by several smaller red orbs that glowed dimly in comparison. The only strange appearance are several small black marks on my ankles.  This could, however, be ink from a pen, but for some odd reason I have not been able to remove these blots.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
3 bright lights in the sky.;2014-08-23 23:00:00;5 minutes;3 bright lights in the sky At approximately 10:45 PM on Saturday, August 23rd, I was in my driveway, when a very bright light appeared to be shining over me and my pet.  I thought perhaps someone was shining a flashlight from their second story bedroom.  As I looked around I could not find the light source and I determined that it could only be coming from above me. When I looked directly over heard, I saw 3 very bright white lights in a row that were stationary in the sky.  They appeared to be at the altitude of a small plane.  There was no sound and as I watched them in the sky, the 2 outer lights quickly merged with the one in the center creating a burst of light and then disappeared. I stood there, thinking that I had witnessed a mid air collision, and that surely debris would begin falling from the sky.  However, there was no debris.  Approximately 5 minutes later, in the far distance just over the tree line I saw a bright flash of light, like that of a camera flash.  That happened twice about 2 minutes apart. I expected to hear something of a sighting on the news, but there was none. I hesitated to file this report but my family thought it was important.  This is one of the strangest things I have ever witnessed.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
I was sitting on my front porch when 2 large very bright lights/objects, one behind the other, appeared in the W sky.;2014-10-11 19:50:00;5;At 7:50 PM on Saturday evening, 10/11/14, I was sitting on my front porch when 2 large very bright lights/objects, one behind the other, appeared in the western sky and moving eastward.   At the bottom of each light/object there was a smaller red blinking light.  It was hard to determine the altitude since they were so large but they appeared to be moving laterally at the same altitude and not climbing. At first I thought they were helicopters but then I realized there was no sound associated with these objects.  I walked into the yard to get a closer look. Just before the second light/object was directly overhead it began to get dimmer and dimmer until it could no longer be seen.  I turned my attention back to the first light/object and watched as it continued eastward.  Then suddenly it also got dimmer and disappear. I stood here for close to 10 minutes to see if they would reappear but they did not.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
Orange lights in the sky over Cumming, Georgia.;2016-05-29 22:15:00;5 minutes;Orange lights in the sky over Cumming, Georgia. I saw two orange lights in the sky.  They were moving parallel to each other, southward, one slightly ahead of the other.  They seemed to be high, at about the same height as a commercial aircraft's cruising altitude.  And at about the same speed.  But there was no sound.   Then, the leading light slowed, and then the trailing light curved around slightly east, and took the lead, but then it halted.   The other light disappeared behind the tree line, but the halted light stayed in position for well over 60 seconds, before turning around, heading west before its light slowly dimming to black.  Very odd;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
Two orange lights in the sky of Cumming Georgia;2016-05-29 22:15:00;2-3 minutes;Two orange lights in the sky of Cumming Georgia My wife and I were hosting an event at our home and just said goodnight to the last guest, my brother. A moment later, we heard knocking at the door. I knew it was my brother and assumed he forgot his phone or wallet and needed to get it before leaving. When I opened the door, my brother asked me to come out and see something strange.  When I walked outside he pointed to two orange lights just above the tree line towards the Northeast.  I immediately dismissed the lights as aircraft.  He corrected me and said they were moving unlike normal aircraft.  He described the objects having moved parallel to each other before rotating and changing direction.  Again, I dismissed him as I only saw two orange lights.  One was stationary and the other was moving similarly to an airplane. He asked me to note the orange nature of the objects and compare them to the light blue stars and the light blue lights of another obvious aircraft behind us. After the comparison, I did admit to the variation in light but simply dismissed the one moving object as an airplane.  The other object I assumed was a planet due to its stationary position and orange glow. By this time, the moving object had disappeared behind the tree line while the stationary object remained in view.  My brother attempted to explain the strange nature of the object's movements when, suddenly, the stationary orange dot began to move.  This startled me.  I watched with astonishment as the object moved along the sky and was temporarily obscured by the tree line before coming back into view.  A moment later, the object faded away like an ember flickering and going out. I was honestly shocked and embarrassed by what I saw.  I am not the type of person who likes attention or believes in intelligent extraterrestrial visitors.  But I do believe in UFOs...  In the purely defined way of something being unidentified.  And what I saw could not be identified. These dots of light were orange, looked like bright stars and appeared to be distant.  My brother and I discussed the possibility of drones but these objects appeared to be quite high.  I don't know much about drones, but I don't think they go that high and I don't think they have orange lights that flicker off.  It was strange.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669

By the time I got around the house, about 5 seconds later, the object was way out in the distance.  The distance would have taken a plane nearly a full minute to travel that far across the sky.

I ignored it and thought it was lightning or I was tired but it kept happening every few minutes, then my son (who is 13) asked if I saw it too.  We blew it off and I went to bed but it happened again...so bright it was  like a strobe but only one flash and no thunder.   We decided to go to the backyard to see.  There was distant lightning, but this was different in quality of light we kept seeing.  At one point a strange vibrating hum outside- like when you rub your finger around the rim of a wine glass, that deep vibrating hum echoed around us...then was gone.  We decided to call it a bus and lightening...but it wasn't.  I'm sure there's an explanation I just don't know what it is.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
I assumed the huge ball of light shooting across the atmosphere was a shooting star, until it stopped abruptly. - Cumming, GA;2018-01-06 04:20:00;20 seconds;I assumed the huge ball of light shooting across the atmosphere was a shooting star, until it stopped abruptly. - Cumming, GA Around 4:20am, I was headed north on GA400 towards my home.  As I passed Exit 13, I noticed what appeared to be a shooting star. It was just a large ball of white light literally moving at lightening speed across the sky.  So my first reaction was to make a wish, but as I'm watching it shoot across the horizon, it didn't disappear.  It literally came to an abrupt stop, which completely startled me.   Then right before me on the highway I then saw what appeared to be an aircraft of some kind, hovering ahead of me.  It had red and blue flashing lights...I really couldn't make out a shape...and thats when it registered that this was definitely something else out of the ordinary.  A few seconds later, it shot off into atmosphere at lightening speed and disappeared.   Both objects moved entirely too fast to be anything logical such as a plane or a helicopter, or even a drone.  In addition, the ball of light traveling lightening speed across the atmosphere and completely stopping, with a random hovering object then appearing...no explanation. Absolutely no explanation.   This weirded me out enough to actually want to report it.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
