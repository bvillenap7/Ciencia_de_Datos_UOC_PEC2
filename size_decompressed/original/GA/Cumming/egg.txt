I was waiting for my daughter in my car when I saw the moon reflecting in my window. Then the moon moved across the width of the sky (NO SOUND).  I was amazed.   When my 15 year old daughter came out I asked her to look up and she sad whats that?  I was not drinking or under the influence of any legal or otherwise substances.  When I looked more closely I could tell it was large as the moon but a little oval like an egg.  The moon was behind grey clouds.  Then a plane flew underneath the object which gave me better perspective of its size.  The plane was like a pen pin point next to a person.  Also the plane looked like it was flying at turtle pace compared to speed of object  Huge.  I was driving towards North and I could see it move from one size of the sky to the other no zig zags just straight.  I called the county non-emergency # to ask if the local Army was doing drills, they said no.  I asked if there was a promotional spotlight in town (it didn't look like a spotlight but I wanted to make sure), they said no.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
