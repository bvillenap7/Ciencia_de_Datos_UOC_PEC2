Triangular craft with lighted sphere bottom hoovering near home in cumming, ga 7-28-10;2010-07-28 15:00:00;1 minute;Triangular craft with lighted sphere bottom hoovering near home in cumming, ga 7-28-10 My son was home playing on his xbox with a group of other online kids, when he heard what he described as the sound of a plane landing.  He took off his headset, stopped playing the game and went outside to see what he thought might be a military helicopter. (we do see military helicopters fly over our home ). He told me he saw a large dark colored triangular shaped craft that had a sphere shaped lighted thing underneath.  He also stated he could see windows' on both sides of the craft, but that they were gray tinted looking.  The sphere had a yellow-whitish light that pulsated.  The craft hoovered over the back field directly in our back yard.  Then the craft shot off very fast into the clouds and disappeared.  I asked him if he was afraid while he stood outside and looked.  He told me that he didnt believe in UFO's, but while he was looking at it he did become confused and somewhat afraid.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
Triangular ship.;2014-03-30 22:00:00;Seconds;Triangular ship My girlfriend and I were on our way to the gas station to pick up some cigarettes and munchies around 10:00 - 10:30 PM EST time..   Well on our way I saw some really cool clouds over this hill.. and I took some pictures of the clouds because they were for some reason easily visible at night.   I got a new camera so the clouds were extremely visible in the photos, but upon later review I saw an object in the two consecutive pictures that I did not see when I was taking the photos..   What do you think? ((NUFORC Note:  Two photos show a tiny 'squiggle of light.  Possible aircraft, we suspect.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669

Triangle shape object over Hwy 20 from Cumming to Buford Ga.;2019-05-17 02:00:00;7 minutes;Triangle shape object over Hwy 20 from Cumming to Buford Ga. Me and my co worker were driving west on Hwy 20 from Cumming, Ga, to Buford, Ga., when we both noticed a gold triangle in the shy off to the south.  We pulled over and sat in the truck watching this triangle flute in the same position not moving in any direction.  I would say it was at 15-20 thousand feet with clear sky’s and sunny.  After about 3 minutes we both saw 3 looked to be jets not  commercial airplanes more like fighter jets approaching it from 3 different directions.  1 from the south 2 from the west 3 from the north.  After a minute or to the triangle rotated counter clockwise and shot up out of site in a matter of seconds.  The 3 other air craft all split off  pursuit and all went South towards Atlanta. The triangle was gold in color but it could have been the sun reflecting off it.  What made this strange was the 3 jets that appeared and tracked the ufo &#128760 until it took off.  We did notice that the triangle object did not leave and exhaust from it.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
2-3 triangular objects about the size of jets above the road floating relatively still . Lights on the corners.;2019-11-17 01:20:00;20 seconds;2-3 triangular objects about the size of jets above the road floating relatively still . Lights on the corners. They were triangle shaped, roughly the size of a commercial jet, but way too low and too close together to be that. After passing by a treeline we couldn’t see them anymore.  If there wasn’t a cop right in front of a neighborhood before the treeline we would have pulled into a neighborhood to get a better look.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
