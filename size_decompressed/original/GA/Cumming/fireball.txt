3 very slow-moving sparking, flaming meteor looking objects starting on 1 side of the horizon and ended in the same spot on the other.;2013-10-01 21:30:00;20 minutes;3 very slow-moving sparking, flaming meteor looking objects starting on 1 side of the horizon and ended in the same spot on the other. The object was moving about the speed and height of a high-flying aircraft, and it appeared to be on fire.  Sparks and flames were clearly visible.  This was not the speed of a meteor by any means.  Once the object reached the other side of the horizon, it appeared that the flames went out - at which point our group though the fire on the plane had been extinguished.  Lo and behold, a second fiery object came from the same side of the sky that the first object rose from, and it did virtually the same thing the first object did and culminated in the same spot.  Then, a third - but more red - flaming object started in the same spot that the first two started, and then flamed out in the same spot where the first two ended.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669

Orange sphere/fireball in sky.  ((anonymous report));2016-06-18 23:30:00;4 minutes;Orange sphere/fireball in sky. Approx 11:30 PM noticed and orange fireball that seemed to rise up from ground then begin moving east to west in my direction.  At first thought it may have been a japanese lantern.  The object was quite low in the sky, probably no higher than a traffic copter would normally fly, however, was probably no more than 1500 to 2000 feet altitude.  Watched as it passed over and moved off towards the west.  Whatever this was it moved quite slow, had none of the usual flashing red/green lights ones sees on the usual aircraft.  It was a clear night, no wind, no clouds yet most notably this craft made zero noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two slow moving fireballs following each other parallel to the earth’s surface;2020-12-01 21:15:00;1-2 minutes;Two slow moving fireballs following each other parallel to the earth’s surface Two fairly slow moving objects, one following the other in a perfectly straight line moving west to east. No sound whatsoever. Both were primarily red and white in color and looked like slow moving fireballs. Took a video on my smartphone. Zoomed in on the second object using pinch and un-pinch. Playing the video, it flashed brightly one time. Never have seen anything like it in my life. Full moon tonight over North GA. I was outside shooting street Christmas lights in our neighborhood. Looked up into the western sky as I walked home at which time I witnessed the sighting. College educated male, age 74.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
