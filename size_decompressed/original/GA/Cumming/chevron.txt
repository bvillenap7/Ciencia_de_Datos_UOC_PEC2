Six-light, V-shaped, craft.;2015-08-25 22:20:00;2 minutes;Six light v shaped craft Driving north on 141 in cumming ga.  I was talking with a friend when i noticed 5 to 6 dim red lights in a v formation.  Mentioned to my friend what i was seeing.   I am a photographer.  24 years experience.  Lights behavior patterns are my forte.  The object apoearred to be two plus feet in diameter across my windshield.  The windshield is two and a half feet from my eyeballs.  My estimation was that it's altitude was 2 miles above.   I observed all the lights oscillate occasionally, in sync, an inch or two.  The point being that it appeared to move  as a whole.  It had a very stealthy feeling because of  the dimness of the red lights.  These lights did occasionally become bright white but remained dim red for the tlmajority of time.  It was heading north west of exit 13.  I knew my iphones sensor could not capture any of the details of this craft.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
