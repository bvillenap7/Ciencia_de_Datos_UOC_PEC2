One object trailing sparks or debris.  suprizingly large, the circular shape was clearly visible.  1/8th the apparent diameter of the moon? debris trail cover about 15 degrees of arc.

Round object that moved from side to side and in a straight motion, disappeared and would reappear during a crystal clear night;2010-07-06 22:00:00;2 minutes;Round object that moved from side to side and in a straight motion, disappeared and would reappear during a crystal clear night While in our backyard admiring the clear night and all the stars and planets that were so bright and brilliant my husband and I both noticed (since we were pointing and looking at the same area) what looked like a star (small, less bright, round in shape) but was moving fairly quickly and smoothly in a straight motion.  After a few seconds it would disappear and would reappear to the side of where it just disappeared and would move in another quick, smooth straight motion, then slowly disappear and reappear again to the opposite side.   We both realized it couldn’t be a plane b/c there were no flashing lights, no noise and planes can only move in a straight forward motion, not move over to the left or right.   We weren’t sure what to think but wanted to report it so it was documented.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
Two Glowing Orange Orbs in the Night Sky;2012-05-19 23:52:00;3 minutes;Two Glowing Orange Orbs in the Night Sky On May 19, 2012 at 11:52 P.M. EST, I witnessed two orange glowing &quotglobes&quot in the night sky. They were maintaining a steady speed and steady distance apart.  They moved up and down above the tree line and across the sky from east to west.  There was no distinct sound emanating from the objects.  There appeared to be a bluish center within the globes. I took a picture with my camera phone.  The picture shows white lights all around the globes, but I did not see any white lights. The two orange globes were like eyes in the sky with no face. There was nothing surrounding them, no light or sound emanating from them.  I watched them for about 3 minutes until they slowly disappeared behind a tree line in the direction of a closed nuclear testing facility within our area.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in the night sky.;34.2234134078213;-84.1378025139669
