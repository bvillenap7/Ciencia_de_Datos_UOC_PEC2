He was with me and at first I thought it was a flash,Mabie a reflection off of an air plane.It flashed then was closer now as big as a house.exactly in front of us. then it flashed again and was positioned over I- 75 where it hovored for about 1 second. Then it shot towards Atlanta. This all happened in about 3 Minutes. If it took that long. This thing had no visable seams,or lights. It was just a silver dome flat on the bottom, Like an upsidedown bowl. I would like to find out what it was. The thing that puzzled us was that no one else seemed to see it or if they did no one showed it.    My name is Donna L. barbee His Gerald J. Burress  We now live in Calhoun Ga.

Photographed ships?;2019-11-13 21:00:00;30 minutes;Photographed ships? I was taking photos of the night sky, and took about 15 or more photos, I recently opened these photos for the first time and was confused by a couple of them, I thought that the camera had moved and ruined the shots, after further examining the photos I realized that all light emitting objects were stationary and giving off proper lighting, it looks like there are possibly 3 different crafts or objects and looking further thru the set of photos I discovered what looked like them leaving, again i reduced the contrast and increased exsposure to check the stationary light sources, didn't seem to be any instability in the Tri-pod or camera.;34.4993;-84.9373
