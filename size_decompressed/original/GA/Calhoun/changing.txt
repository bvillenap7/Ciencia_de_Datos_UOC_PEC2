Object seen to the west from Calhoun Georgia at 4:45;2019-12-30 04:45:00;~30 minutes;Object seen to the west from Calhoun Georgia at 4:45 My roommate and I witnessed an object in the sky that had what appeared to be flat bottom with a light shining downward.  The brightest light was at the top with a stream of light beneath it.  The two seemed to move fairly independently of one another.  It was clearly visible to the west from my front porch beginning at 4:45 AM and disappeared from my field of vision at around 5:15.  We watched it for about 30 minutes.  In that time, it ascended and descended near the horizon several times, but eventually dropped from our field of view altogether.  It flashed every neon color imaginable and rotated sort of like a top, but very slowly and sporadically.  Almost like stop motion animation.  Looked like a star, but if it moved and instead of being round, was shaped like an umbrella or maybe even a jellyfish. Planes began to pass by the object.  Shortly after the planes got close to it, it descended from view.;34.4993;-84.9373
