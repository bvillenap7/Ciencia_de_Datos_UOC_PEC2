Cannot recall the events inside the craft....;2009-12-25 01:00:00;????;Cannot recall the events inside the craft.... We were loading up the Jeep Cherokee to drive to a family members house when *anonomyous* looked toward the sky and noticed some crafts zig zagging across the  horizon.  Next, there was a flash of light, brighter than the sunshine.  When our vision recovered we realized we were surrounded on all sides by these crafts.  After 20 stressful mins the hatches to the crafts slowly began to open. A thick fog or smokey substance rolled out.  The creatures then began to imurge. A dozen or so, small, brownish, with a kind of liquid skin.  They spoke telepathically, the conversation started out with the advacement of quantum mechanics and led swiftly to current politics.  What i believe to be the 'leader' of one craft took my hand and led us into the larger of the crafts.  The next thing I remember is waking up naked by the river.;34.4993;-84.9373
