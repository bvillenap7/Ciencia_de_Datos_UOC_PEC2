Off white orb moving N. to S. no sound then vanished over Calhoun with a well lit moonlit sky.;2020-04-05 21:00:00;2 minutes;Off white orb moving N. to S. no sound then vanished over Calhoun with a well lit moonlit sky. At approx. 9pm, we were sitting around a campfire in our backyard. We live outside the city limits of Calhoun in the Sonoraville area. My property is located in the flight pattern of the Atlanta Airport so at any given time we can see several jets in the sky usually in the same altitude and patterns leaving Atlanta as well as arriving. I was observing the moon and stars when an orb shaped object came from over the tree line out into the open with a very unobstructed view. It was an off white glow and I called its attention to my son and two grandsons. It moved steadily and its light did not fluctuate. There was no sound and no vapor trail. I mention this as all the jets overhead are audible and with the moon being nearly full their vapor trails were visible at night. It was not moving at a high rate of speed but was lower than the usual jets that fly over. It was moving from North to south and when it entered the glow of the moonlight just seemed to vanish. ! I insisted it flew into a cloud but my kids all said there were no clouds. A minute or so later we observed a jet moving south in a similar pattern and it did not disappear when it passed the moon.  Curious if anyone else saw this.;34.4993;-84.9373
