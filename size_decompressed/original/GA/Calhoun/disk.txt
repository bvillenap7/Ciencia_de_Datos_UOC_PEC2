The craft was coming straight to my location where I was sitting in the car. It was obout 300 ft. above the ground. At first I thought someone was flying something from the ground. The craft moved closer to where I was parked. All at once it turned and headed straight west picking up speed rapidly, and then it turned and went up northward real fast at an angle of about 45 degree and disappeared. The craft was disc shaped with A dome on the top. The color of the craft was silver grey.  I heard no noise as I was in the car.  I started to get out of the car and tell other people to look, but they would think I was crazy.  I had no camera with me to get A picture.

Large craft with red blinking lights.;2015-08-25 22:00:00;90 seconds;Large craft with red blinking lights Sighted on 8/25/2015.  Approximately 10:38 pm in Calhoun, Georgia.  Duration of sighting: Approximately ninety seconds. I was in my driveway, after letting my two small dogs out to go to the bathroom.  I glanced up to the west and I’m guessing here, about a mile or mile and a half away I saw a large object.  From my location it was two inches in width, so say two miles away, visually two inches across, how big would this thing have been?  It had exactly four red lights across it that blinked steadily, one after the next.  It was moving slowly northward.  It stopped and then the whole object canted to the right and dipped downward as if it was landing.  It disappeared beneath the tree line from my vantage point. I can’t be the only one who saw this but I haven’t found any mention of it in the news anywhere.;34.4993;-84.9373
