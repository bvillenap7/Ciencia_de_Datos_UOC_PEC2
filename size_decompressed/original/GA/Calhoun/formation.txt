At first we thought its a line of helicopters but they moved much differently, much slower and there was no sound, we live in the county, there are very few lights out here, the sky is dark and out here at this time of night its very quiet so things like planes and helicopters are really loud.  They were heading west towards town than seemed to drift to the north east, I saw the middle lights move out of formation just a bit, but my husband said they all did move than go back quickly in line,heading west again.  We do not know what that was and could not explain at all what it could be and so I decided to relate this sighting to you.  My husband was in the air force ! for 10 years, he had no idea what this was that we saw.  The color change I noted was blinking and not the same color at the same time.  We tried to get a picture on our phone but failed due to the flash and it being night time.  Thank you;34.4993;-84.9373
