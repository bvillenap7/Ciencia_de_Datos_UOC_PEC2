The craft had two square objects visible in each corner, with connecting tubes or pipes.Motionless I observed the object walking between building on company property where I work, I had raised a production tag up above my head to see the machine number in the security lights, because it was still dark, 5:00 am. I would have never have known it was there if I hadn`t looked up, it  made absolutly no sound ,with no lights but the city lights must have made the bottom visible because it was very clear. I never was able to see the front of the craft because of the cloud cover, which was coming from the south, or the left side because of the building walls which are about 20 or 25 feet tall,therefore I cannot say how large it actually was,slowly moving or motionless.;34.4993;-84.9373
