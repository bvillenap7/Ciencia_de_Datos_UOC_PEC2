The lighted objects are all ways in the darkest part of the sky. This  was the first time in Ga I have seen the fireballs.  I zoomed in fast as could.  The shape of it was weird, but it seemed to go faster as I started to film it.   There is a lot of activity around certain nights here.  The picture with white circle light following this green thing, I have tried to look online to see if any one else saw it.  The objects made no sound.  I have not seen it again since.  The other thing with the several lights appears to be a triangle but hard to tell.  It was just me and my husband. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.
