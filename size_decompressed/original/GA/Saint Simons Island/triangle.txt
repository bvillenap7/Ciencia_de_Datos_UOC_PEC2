Two fast, silent, red-orange triangles over St. Simons Island, Georgia.;2016-08-18 20:30:00;10-15 seconds;Two fast, silent, red-orange triangles over St. Simons Island, Georgia. One very bright orange triangle with an exhaust-trail that looked like a small flame flew across the sky:  the triangle appeared about half the size of a dime held at arm's length.  The vehicle was flying without sound from East-South-East to North-North-West. About 5 seconds later an identical vehicle followed the first on the same flight path, and they flew across half the sky in 10 seconds, before a building obscured them.   The triangles were as bright as a flashlight, which is what made me look up to the sky to see them. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Date error on prior report:  please correct year to 2016 (not 2017).
