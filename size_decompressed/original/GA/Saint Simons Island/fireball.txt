Two people witness 5+ dull orange spheres.;2012-11-01 23:30:00;<1 minute;Two people witness 5+ dull orange spheres. My wife and I were sitting in a rented, beach front condo, 4th floor open air balcony around 11:30 pm.  The condo is on a Georgia island in the Atlantic ocean.  The night sky was clear with the final stage of a full moon.   My wife was the first to notice a dull orange sphere floating above the condo unit opposite of where we were observing.  It appeared to move and float without a sound.  The sphere seemed to be traveling along the beach, but then made a 90 degree turn and headed out over the ocean, disappearing in the darkness.   This same route and sequence was soon repeated by 5 or more other, identical looking dull orange spheres.   This was observed for approximately one minute or less.?;31.2294;-81.349
