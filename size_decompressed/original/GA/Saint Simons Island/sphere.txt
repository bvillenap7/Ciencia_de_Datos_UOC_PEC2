UFO REPORT 27 Sept., 2011  For the past 3 weeks, at night often between 12:30 AM to 1:00 AM (the time span may be greater), a small, extremely bright, rounded (spherical?), single object has appeared at about 20,000 feet altitude, located near or over St. Simons Island, GA.  The FUO may stand still in the sky for a few moments (10-20 seconds), then rapidly dart erratically in any direction, very much like a humming bird or butterfly.  The flight of the FUO is extremely fast….a split second to cover a fair distance.  Judging from its motion and speed, I don’t think that it is an airplane, helicopter or balloon.  I have no binoculars or telescope to verify the exact nature of the object, only my natural vision.  On cloudy nights the object cannot be seen.  WHAT IS IT?  I am concerned. ((NUFORC Note:  Star??
