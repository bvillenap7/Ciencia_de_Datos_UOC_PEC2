Hovering blue object spotted over Saint Simons Island, GA;2017-07-04 21:00:00;10-20 minutes;Hovering blue object spotted over Saint Simons Island, GA Around or just after 9:00 PM on July 4, 2017, some friends and I stepped out onto the roof of a local restaurant in the pier village on Saint Simons Island, GA.  We were there to watch the Fourth of July fireworks display.  The fireworks show was taking place in front of the restaurant.   When we turned around, though, we saw, at least a couple of blocks or so away from us, a strange blue-ish object hovering in one place in the sky for several.  I personally observed the object for several minutes, before I finally went back inside the restaurant.   According to another witness, after I went back inside the restaurant, the object briefly moved around in the sky erratically before it finally descended and appeared to land, disappearing from view.  What became of the object after it descended remains unknown.;31.2294;-81.349
