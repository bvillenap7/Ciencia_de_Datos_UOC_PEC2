It was shaped as a circle, 1/2 cm round at arms' length, and was very shiny and bright, as if it were made of a silver material and radiating the sun's reflection.  It left no trails and floated gracefully high above commercial jets at a much faster pace. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));31.2294;-81.349
Sighting of two UFOs at the same time (bright objects darting in the sky late at night).;2011-09-28 12:30:00;1 hr?;Sighting of two UFOs at the same time (bright objects darting in the sky late at night). UFO REPORT No. 2 On 27 Sept., 2011, I reported a bright UFO darting around overhead in the dark sky.  The object was there again early this morning 12:30-13:00 hrs. over St. Simons Island, GA.  At the same time, to my amazement, a second identical bright flying object was seen by me, located fairly far to the north.  Our nearest military base is Kings Bay naval submarine base at St. Maryâ€™s 40 miles to the south of us, near the Florida border.  Please check into what I am reporting.  It may be important !   Do we have similar UFOs appearing at night all along the Atlantic seaboard?   There has to be a reason for what I am seeing.  I am deeply concerned.;31.2294;-81.349
