I started to notice that I could see a small bright light moving quickly across the sky.  I didn’t pay much attention because I thought it had to be the reflection of headlights or my eyes just playing tricks on me.  After about 30 minutes, I realized that it looked to be a star moving side to side and in circles. I started to get concerned thinking maybe someone was outside playing a prank with a Lazer or drone so I woke my boyfriend up to check it out.  Of course, when he tried to see it do anything it stopped moving and he assumed it was a star and went back to bed.  About five minutes later I decided to take a video because I knew no one would believe me unless they saw it for theirselves. At this point it was flickering on and off disappearing completely and showing back up in a different spot. I could see it was pulsating red and blue lights. It started moving in a figure eight motion and then back and forth and then just disappeared. My step dad is also a pilot and the biggest skeptic in the world. I feel like that’s the most credible witness you could ever have and him not being able to explain this just blows my mind. I’ve always been interested in this subject but I never thought I would see something this. It is making me a little uneasy being at home by myself at night but I will be continuing to look out for it to return. I also have the video if you would like to see that as well.;33.6832;-85.2228
