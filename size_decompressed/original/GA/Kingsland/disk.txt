Saucer-shaped ufo hovering next to I 95 south near Jacksonville, FL, airport with lights blinking on and off.;2014-11-27 21:30:00;30 seconds;Saucer shaped ufo hovering next to I-95 south near Jacksonville, FL, airport with lights blinking on and off. I was traveling south on I-95 a few miles north of the Florida state line near Jacksonville at 9:30 pm.   There was a saucer shaped object that appeared to be hovering near the side of the expressway and its lights would blink on and off every few seconds.   As I passed it, it was so close I could see under it.  It was all lit up underneath and I could see several circle shapes that were part of the saucer on the bottom.   I passed it at 72 mph but it was not moving.   It was very near the Jacksonville airport. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
