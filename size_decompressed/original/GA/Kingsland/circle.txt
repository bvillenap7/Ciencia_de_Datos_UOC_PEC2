Circular Object with many lights.;2007-03-14 10:10:00;2 minutes;Circular Object with many lights. I was sitting outside on my back porch talking on the phone to my grandmother. I was watching the planes go over head and since I since I live near an airport there are at least 7 planes flying in the sky at night. I looked over the trees and saw a very strange cluster of bright lights moving very slowly. I told my grandmother that I think I see a UFO.  The lights were flashing all the way around the center of the craft as it slowly headed over the trees. My grandmother kept insisting that is was a plane but it was too close to the trees to be a plane and it wouldâ€™ve made some kind of noise. You can hear the planes when they are only tiny dots in the sky. The UFO made no sound whatsoever and it was moving way too slow to be plane.;30.7968;-81.7051
