The light remained stationary and then flew upwards at an extremely accelerated rate.   At this time we noticed several other lights moving in various formations.  Some of the lights moved horizontally, while others moved vertically.  Many of the lights changed directions over the course of 15 minutes.  Most of the lights remained visible in the sky for 10 minutes, moving in various directions at various speeds until they quickly accelerated vertically and disappeared.  Total, there were around 8-10 lights.   The event ended when two planes appeared in the sky and headed towards two remaining lights.   At this time, the two lights converged into one and disappeared.  I grew up near Cecil Field (Yellowater) and an outlying naval field, so I am used to seeing strange aerial phenomenon.  However, I have never seen craft move with this much variance in speed and direction. This was my fiancé's first experience witnessing aerial phenomenon.;30.7968;-81.7051
