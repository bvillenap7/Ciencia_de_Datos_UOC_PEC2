First there were several bright flashes of light that completely lit up the night sky. It was almost like that from a lightning storm on a clear night. It reminded me of a bright camera flash. Then a huge ball of light sped behind some trees and disappeared. There was no noticeable noise.;34.8542;-84.3279

It would intermitandly stop and faintly glow.   A few seconds later the rest of the group pointed out a similar object.  We observed the light slowly move from south to north stopping every 20 to 30 seconds.  Every time the light seemed to stop the light went from pure white, mint green, and finally dark green and grew intensely bright. We lost sight of the light for a few seconds then suddenly we all saw the light again.  The only way we could explain its light going completely out.;34.8542;-84.3279
