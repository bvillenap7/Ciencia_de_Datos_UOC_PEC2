Large round craft with lights all around on Georgia mountain top.;2006-12-29 23:00:00;several min.;Large round craft with lights all around on Georgia mountain top. I was traveling in north Georgia, heading to Blue Ridge to visit friends.  It was late at night. I was towing a heavy trailer. I was not familiar with the area. I do know I was going around a mountain, clockwise. I was near the top.  To my right, thru the passenger side window, I noticed something very large and round.  It had many lights all around it.  It seemed to be descending.  As I circled the mountain I saw it again.  It still seemed to be moving.  Even though it seemed to be moving, I told myself it was because I was moving.  I couldnâ€™t stop to look.  I told myself it must be a large house.  Two weeks later I asked someone who lives in that area what it could have been.  She told me there was nothing there that sounds like what I described.  To me it looked like a large round house with picture windows all around it.  The windows were lit up. There were lights above and below the windows.;34.8542;-84.3279
