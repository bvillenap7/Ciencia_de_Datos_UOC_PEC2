Large bus shape or cigar shaped silver craft very high in the sky no sound no trail no lights.;2014-10-19 13:00:00;7 minutes;Large bus shape or cigar shaped silver craft very high in the sky no sound no trail no lights. At exactly 1:15 pm today I was lying in my easy chair looking at the sky,  I saw a strange object very high in the sky.  The object was long ( bus shaped) silver in color, no sound, no emission or trail.  I watched it for approximately 7 minutes.  I am wondering if anyone else reported seeing a strange craft in the North Georgia sky today?;34.8542;-84.3279
