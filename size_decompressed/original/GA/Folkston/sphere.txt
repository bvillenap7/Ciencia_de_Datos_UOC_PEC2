While driving to work  around 0518am EST  I notice an object  roughly at a 60 Degree angle of  our truck  to the North East of Folkston in the air burning leaving a trail of silver sparkles. I got my workers attention and he too witnessed the object  Break up.  We could see pieces falling in a curved slowing manor burning as they was falling.  This was no meter, was way too slow.     The who event lasted  maybe 12 seconds by the time we got stop in a good clear area it had faded and all you could see was a smoke trail.  We started driving again and as we was heading down Hwy 40 heading East North East we spotted a Orange Sphere traveling at a high Rate of Speed to the Area where the Object had came in at this Orange Sphere Disappeared when it got to the Area. Roughly 3 mins later a Large White Sphere appeared in the same area this sphere was very bright, and there was a smaller orange sphere flying to the side of the big white one.  The Big White one gave a! bright flash and appeared to accelerate at a very high speed directly straight up as it got smaller and dimmer in a matter of Seconds little one was not seen again roughly 20 seconds later the Original Orange Sphere appeared again and headed back to the east at a high rate of speed and disappeared behind some clouds.;30.8518;-82.0074
