2 round shaped lights approx 4-5 times higher than commercial aircraft can fly.;2001-11-17 19:30:00;15 - 20 seconds;2 round shaped lights approx 4-5 times higher than commercial aircraft can fly. I saw two round shaped lights approx 4-5 times higher than commercial aircraft can fly moving south to north in view for about 15 to 25 seconds.  Know of nothing that flies at that altitude.;33.3101;-83.7109
singular light running across the sky too fast for satelight and too slow for shooting star with no blinking lights.;2010-09-30 22:30:00;approx. 30 sec.;singular light running across the sky too fast for satelight and too slow for shooting star with no blinking lights. About 36 hours ago, I was standing out in my front yard of my new farm.  I was reading The Old Farmers Almanac and it said to look in the southern sky at nite to get a fantastic view of the planet Jupiter, as it is the brightest lite in the sky at this time of this year.  I stood and easily found it.  I called my wife outside to look at it.  We admired the bright planet for a few minutes and went back inside. Later that nite at about 10:30-11:00 pm., I went outside to investigate what I thought were some dangerously close coyotees, (I have 2 dogs and 3 cats).  When realizing that there was no apparent danger I looked up again to take another look at Jupiter when I noticed a rather quick moving light going across the sky heading in a straight line (north-by-northeast I would say). Normally, I would think nothing of it as Atlanta is a huge airway and we occassionally see aircraft in the area. However,  this light (as I pointed out to my wife), had no signal lights or other identifying features.  It was moving too quickly to be a satelight (as I have seen them before).  It didn't look like a shooting star as it was moving to slow for that.  It also had no tail. The best way I and my wife can discribe it is a far off light moving quickly from horizon to horizon in a staight line much like an aircraft would do, but without any other tell-tale blinking lights.  Until the day I die I suppose I will always wonder what that was two nites ago.;33.3101;-83.7109
