Orange sphere hovering in the night sky, then disappeared at incredible speed;2012-02-16 23:30:00;5 minutes;Orange sphere hovering in the night sky, then disappeared at incredible speed I was driving home along a back road from Douglas to Pearson when I looked out my window and saw a large spherical object hovering to my right.  It was larger and brighter than any star or planet I’ve ever seen.  It was orange in color and just hovering, making no movement at all.   I pulled over to get out for a better look and observed the object for about 5 minutes, then all of sudden it shot straight up into the air at an incredible speed and disappeared.   I’ve never seen anything like this before.;31.3092;-82.8615
