The firemen were finishing up and returning their hoses to the trucks. I was standing behind them when the man in front of me said, What is that? and pointed upward.   There was a triangular shaped object with bright colored lights on each point hovering over the house across the street.  It came towards us, shrank in size, and lowered down over the firetruck for a few seconds and then zoomed off. It made no sound.   Strangely, only a few of us saw it.;34.266177669903;-85.1809446601942
UFO over old GE building, heading towards Armuchee;2007-11-15 18:45:00;5 minutes;UFO over old GE building, heading towards Armuchee I am writing this about ten minutes after witnessing what I can say was definitely NOT an airplane.  Me and my girlfriend were leaving Walmart and just a few minutes from home when we saw a bright triangle of white lights coming towards us. At first we thought maybe it was a plane but it did not look like any plane that I had ever seen.  It did not have the colored lights on the wings, or really any wings at all from what I could tell.  The white lights that we did see were on the bottom of the object and as it got closer we could see that it was in a triangular shape, with the lights going out towards each angle. The lights reminded me of the flux capacitor in Back to the Future - but they did not flash, they were glowing constantly.  And they were extremely bright, like the lights at a night game of a baseball. This was the second time that my girlfriend has seen this object, the first time was when our house caught on fire a little over a year ago - she said the object we saw tonight looked exactly like the one she saw at the fire.;34.266177669903;-85.1809446601942

Before he got there the truck had shut off for no reason and the lights in the parking lot turned on and off.  It was early in the day so I was wondering why the lights had cut off.    Then I had heard a very lound noise as if someone had released a ton of pressurized air.  I then got out of the truck and looked up,  I had counted 17 triangular aircrafts that we’re in a triangular formation and then one was ahead of the formation off alone.   After I had counted them a light came from the first one ahead of them all and they disappeared.  My dad asked why I sat out in the truck so long when I walked to the room to tell him, I told him I was waiting for him so we could go to Walmart, he then told me I had sat out in the truck for 2 hours.  Which had only felt like seconds.   The next day I woke up with bruising on my arms and legs (I didn’t think anything of it).  Two days later a man showed up at my room asking about what I saw, he then showed me a picture of what I had saw and asked if that was the shape the craft.  I said yes, then he proceeded to ask how many and the exact location.  He then asked me to not say anything to anyone.  Then he went on his way.;34.266177669903;-85.1809446601942
