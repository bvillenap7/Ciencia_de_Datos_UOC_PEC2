We at first thought it to be a love flying jet but we followed it's movement and it was soon joined by approximately four other objects.  They were in formation with the first object we had spotted being in the lead. Actually, I believe that the first object dropped (descended) and then the other four obects fell in behind.  As I watched the objects disappear, the whole mountain over which they had flown or floated was completely bathed in a light that was glowing a reddish-orange color.  I ran to get a witness other than my now terrifed child and an elderly lady also witnessed the whole mountain lighting up.  I tried to rationalize by convincing myself that these were jets and one of then at least had crashed into the mountains.  No plane crash as far as I can find out was reported and also five jets would not have been flying over Lavendar Mountain as low as this.  I did find an article in the Rome News Tribune about a spacecraft, or flying saucer looking object that the Berry College students had designed and actually gotten to fly..There was a picture of the flying saucer in the paper.  Just one.  Not Five.  And Berry College is anAgricultural College.  This is the first time I have ever heard of themAlso I hav dealing with aerospace.  It just did not make much sense and the more I think about it the more I wonder if the story in the newspaper about the flight worthy aircraft erected by some college boys at an Agricultural College is not some sort of cover-up for something.Also my daughter and I have not come across anyone else except the two of us and the elderly lady whom I knew who experienced this sighting.  How can that be possible.  The whole mountain lit up in the dark. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Source is anonymous.  PD));34.266177669903;-85.1809446601942
Two black  rotating tires revolving around each other seen in western sky flying in a southeastern direction in Rome, GA on 11 Aug.;2003-08-11 16:30:00;About 10 Minutes;Two black  rotating tires revolving around each other seen in western sky flying in a southeastern direction in Rome, GA on 11 Aug. The  black craft was seen traveling in the western sky heading in a southeastern direction.It reminded me of two tires, each rotating and each rotating around each other. They seemed to be one craft but I could not discern a connection between the two. I could see the sky through the center of each wheel. When it banked the craft was barely visible as it appeared to be one straight line. I watched it through binoculars as it gained altitude until my view became obstructed by trees.There was no sound.;34.266177669903;-85.1809446601942
Huge green lit object zooms into sky after scaring ((deleted)) me.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2015-11-11 03:27:00;5 seconds;Huge green lit object zooms into sky after scaring ((deleted)) me. My girlfriend and I were at Fuche Gap (however you spell it).  She was turned around backwards in the front seat (facing the backseat) while I was looking forward.  We go there to talk and look at the stars.   I'm just staring out the front windshield when I see I green light.  It was HUGE!!!  She saw a flash out the corner of her eye and spun around to see it.  It lit up one light at a time very fast and zoomed up towards the sky.  I've never been so scared before.  I felt nausea and I was terrified afterwards.;34.266177669903;-85.1809446601942
