Two Bright Lights observed - faded away simultaneously;2007-03-30 21:01:00;1 min 30 seconds;Two Bright Lights observed - faded away simultaneously Two lights as bright as the North Star was lined up vertically, they appeared in the North Eastern sky for about a minute and a half. We attempted to view with a telescope but the lights disappeared in like manner. We first thought the lights were very bright stars but one of the observers said no stars that bright would be in that part of the sky. Both lights faded simultaneously and seemed to move up and away, they did not return. These lights were viewed by 8 people and the sky was cloud free.;34.266177669903;-85.1809446601942
4 flahsing lights hovering in night sky;2008-02-09 11:15:00;3-5 minutes;4 flahsing lights hovering in night sky Around the date of February 9, my father and I were standing on our back porch smoking a cigarette.  We live out in the country probably 8 miles out of town.  I was looking at the moon and noticed 4 diferently colored lights flashing fast.  I think the colors were red, white, yellow, and blue.  At first I didn't think anything of it then I began thinking when I see airplanes at night flying overhead there are only two lights flashing, one on each wing, and both are colored white.  Well the lights on the aircraft where of different colors, and where flashing rapidly, faster than I have ever seen an  airplane lights flash.  Also, the where flashing in different orders such like the red would flash, then the blue, then yellow, then white all at random choice it seemed.  The object didn't seem to be moving, just sitting in the sky.  I cannot tell a definite shape because it was pitch dark all I saw were those lights.

Video taped a large multi-colored lighted object in the sky below Orion.;2013-11-22 22:45:00;>4 hours;Video taped a large multi-colored lighted object in the sky below Orion. On the evening of November 22, 2013 at approximately 10:45pm I arrived home late from work.  I live in Rome Georgia (45 mins North of Atlanta).  My home is located on top of Mt. Alto. A small (3000ft approx) mountain.  Two lane road with houses on both sides of the road.  Very nice views north or south.  As I was getting out of my truck I noticed what appeared to be a very bright star - but it looked too close to truly be a star.  Plus it was blinking like planets blink.  Sort of changing colors white-red-yellow but only slightly.  The changes were not extremely noticeable.  It was just twinkling - but again it looked too close and too bright to be a star.  It was about approx 35 degrees or so up in the sky.  Orion was up as well as the north star. The object was below Orions foot and to the left of the North Star.  It was an extremely cold and clear night.  No clouds whatsoever.  I decided to go get a pair of my binoculars - but could only find a! pair of my kids - which are basically just toys.  It actually made my view worse.  I decided to see what my phone would do.  I put it on video (Droid Razr Maxx) - Immediately I saw a distinct shape and set of lights in a row.  Looked like the classic saucer shape lights in a line.  I videod it like this for about 20 seconds or so and then zoomed in.  Once I zoomed in - it was incredible.  The object is HUGE.  Dozens of lights blinking - some random and some in a definite pattern.  The object then appeared to be cigar shaped with what appears to be a tall tail or fin on the far right side.  Lights would appear all along the object in different colors - red,green,white,yellow and in many different places along the object (in a line in front - and randomly through the center and then again in a line on the tail/fin).  It appears to be just MASSIVE.  I can only slightly make out the shape - but the lights are very obvious.  It sat in the sky for at least 4 or 5 hours. The obje! ct never moved in a traditional sense.  Once while videoing it! with my camera it shifted up in the sky about an inch or more INSTANTLY.  Also it moved four or five inches to the right in the sky one time and then back left - both times the movement was so fast it was almost like it just appeared in the new spot. I did not catch the right left movement on camera as I was changing the batteries. I videoed it for about 20+ mins on my regular video camera as well as my phone.  My wife came outside and watched it with me.  But it was late - after 11pm by this time and extremely cold.  I also noticed an unusual amount of static electricity in my house later that evening - that I have never noticed before and have not experienced since.  I have looked each night since the sighting but have not seen it appear again.  The object would easily be confused as a star to the naked eye.  I have a large amount of video of this object and as of the typing of this report I have turned the video in to MUFON and this organization for further investiga! tion!;34.266177669903;-85.1809446601942
