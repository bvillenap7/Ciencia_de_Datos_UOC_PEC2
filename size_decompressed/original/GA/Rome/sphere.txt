The ship was floating SW to NE then changed slightly to the north. It was round with three sets of lights. The top and bottom row were white and rotating to the right and the middle set was rotating to the left. It flew just right abve tree level and was a good. There were no other lights, it was extremely dark in color. Even when the safty light from the church accross the street reflected off from it, it was still as black as starless night. It made a faint whirring sound and that is what attracted my attention, because it sounded like a small plane with engine trouble. The unusual thing was I could not move nor could I yell for my dad.
