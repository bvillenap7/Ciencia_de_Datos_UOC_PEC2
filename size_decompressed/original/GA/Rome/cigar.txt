((anonymous report));2017-10-12 15:58:00;~1 minute;A shiny object that was sitting still in the sky then suddenly disappeared. I was driving on Hwy 53 from Calhoun to Rome, when I noticed an object just sitting still in the sky, reflecting the sun, as I start into a curve the reflection goes away but returns as I go through the curb and the object remains.  All of a sudden, it's gone.  There were no clouds in the sky for it go behind, it just vanished.  It was close to a power substation.
