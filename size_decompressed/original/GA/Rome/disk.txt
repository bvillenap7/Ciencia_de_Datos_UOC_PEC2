Silver disk seen over the Rome, Georgia area.;2003-10-19 12:00:00;not sure;Silver disk seen over the Rome, Georgia area. I was traveling on a back road from Calhoun, GA to Rome when I noticed a silver flash in the sky. I slowed down to look and at first thought it was a ballon. It was silver and very shiny and metalic looking. It would turn up and to the side and looked like a pie pan. When it turned on its side it was totaly flat. I could not tell its distance because the sky was clear and blue and there was no point of reference such as clouds in the sky. I tried to call my friend on my cell phone to tell her to look in the sky but my cell phone went dead. When I arrived at her house about ten minutes later we could not find it in the sky.
