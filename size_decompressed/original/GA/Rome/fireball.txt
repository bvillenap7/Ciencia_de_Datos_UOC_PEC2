Glowing green object in the southen skies, November 28 ,2006;2006-11-28 18:35:00;5 seconds;Glowing green object in the southen skies, November 28 ,2006 Appearing out of the clouds at about 2000 feet,and descending at approximately a 45 degree angle, from a North Western heading to the South East, the object became visible after emmiting a glowing light in the clouds for approximately 3 seconds. As it became visible the object took on a flaming/glowing green hue, indicating a high metal content. The object was then visible in the sky for about 5 seconds which gave all witnesses a excellent view of its descent. This object, at the end of its descent broke up into several smaller objects and appeared to strike the earth. In my opinion, this object was no more than space debris or a meteorite.;34.266177669903;-85.1809446601942
Blue-green ball of light emitting sparks streaking across sky in Rome, GA.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  PD));2007-02-21 21:00:00;5 seconds;Blue-green ball of light emitting sparks streaking across sky in Rome, Georgia My wife and I were coming home from church, and we were driving up the street/hill to our house, when we noticed a blue-green light in the sky that was very bright and large and moved very quickly from left to right above the tree line.  And, it had a trail of sparks.  It looked somewhat like a meteor.;34.266177669903;-85.1809446601942
Orange ball of light over house;2020-09-05 21:06:00;1-2 minutes;Orange ball of light over house We were outside watching an outdoor movie and swimming in the pool at 9:06 PM on September 5, 2020 we noticed a rather low, circular, fire ball, orange light hover over the house. We joked that it was a drone and somebody was watching us but then realized that it did not appear to have any LED lights or blinking lights. It was just one big round orange light.  We have previously watched the space station go over our house multiple times  and occasionally other things in the night sky. This was definitely something out of the ordinary and very much unlike a plane or anything else weâ€™ve ever seen.  It then went around towards the front of the house where my husband and brother-in-law followed it and watched it suddenly speed up rapidly and then it just disappeared.;34.266177669903;-85.1809446601942
