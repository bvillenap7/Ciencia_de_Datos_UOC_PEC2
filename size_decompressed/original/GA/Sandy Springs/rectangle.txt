Flying southeast, it appeared to be in our atmosphere, but faint, we were unable to visibly make out its exact definition. But whatever it was, it was huge. We had our phones with us, but captivated by the sight, we didnt record it. This what we saw. Its hard to describe, but here we go. It was larger than 2 football fields, at least ten blinking white lights simultaneously, equally short distance from each other, formed in a straight line of the direction of flight (like from tip to nose).  It was slow moving, gliding overhead.  As it passed, we began to make out multiple (~20) red and blue lights blinking simultaneously, which formed triangle at the tail, another triangle midway/center on the left side and other the right. Sorry, my description is horrible. BTW: we were not on any substance, totally sober. I highly doubt it's ET - proba! bly military, it was an incredible sight. Any insight?;33.9238;-84.3869
