Bright light with no FAA lights spotted over Sandy Springs area.;2007-02-13 19:40:00;10 mins;Bright light with no FAA lights spotted over Sandy Springs area. My mother and I were driving down Abernathy road away from 400 towards Roswell road when we spotted what we thought was a helicopter just underneath the clouds on our left at about a 10 o'clock position.  I didn't see any FAA lights nor the standard Red rotating light that most helicopters use.   We did see one of those further up the street.  Just a red light on the bottom.   This object was stationary and not blinking, just a light.  We lost it when the clouds drew over the area.   As we parked the car and looked back at the stars, we noticed that Sirius A was very bright as well, but not at all the brightness nor color of the light we saw earlier.;33.9238;-84.3869
A light in the sky disappears;2012-07-15 04:00:00;2 minutes;a light in the sky disappears Adult male and adult female, while walking home from the convenience store, were bewildered by a small light that traveled steadily overhead from west to east.  The object then suddenly disappeared.  After looking at NASA.gov list of visible satellites in the area for that night, none were reported for that time.;33.9238;-84.3869

Walking with my girlfriend around our apartment complex, she looked into the cloudy evening sky and said, What is that?  I looked up to see a large red light in the sky, sitting still.  Within a couple of minutes, the object darted across the sky and stopped.  The object began changing colors from its original red to white to green.  The color change repeated for about three minutes before disappearing completely.  The object reappeared in a different location and began moving again, this time moving what looked to be at a gradual speed.  Before long, the object jerked, switched position and flew FAST, vanishing into the night.;33.9238;-84.3869

Driving in the left lane, it was quite dark at that time.  The sun wasn't anywhere near coming up that early this late in the year. I noticed a small orange light break the west treeline. Th light quickly maneuvered in a zig zag line as it rose into the sky and the moved over the southbound lanes of GA400 and then just hovered, about 100' off the ground, until I drove under it.  At first, I thought it was a helicopter, not uncommon as ATL traffic gets underway.  But as I got closer, I realized it most definitely was not a helicopter.  It was a dirty/burnt orange light. Bright enough to see from a distance but not as bright as say a parking lot light.  Not sure if it made any sound as I was driving in the left lane with the windows up.  Could have been a drone, but odd to see a drone that early in the morning, over 400 and in those temperatures...I drive that way every day, at the same time. Been doing it for 11years and that is the 1st time I have ever seen anything like that.;33.9238;-84.3869
