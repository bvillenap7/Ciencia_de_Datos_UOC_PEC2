Two hovering object over sandy springs Ga;2008-03-08 09:00:00;2 minutes;Two hovering object over sandy springs Ga My wife and I were taking a sunday morning walk I crossed the street and noticed a shiny light in the sky, it was about the same level as the clouds so  I assumed it was a high flying jet just moving slowly as I walked a bit more I noticed that there was two of them just sitting there in the sky, no other plains were there and there was only one big cloud in the sky no others.  I began to obseve as I walked and passes a tree that blocked the view of the cream colored one then that one was gone but I felt it was still there, as I looked the other silver one just sat there then it tilted its point downward and took off in a intense speed.  then shortly after that planes started coming from all over. ( regular passanger)  We have a airforce base and airport in between where they were spotted but I feel no craft could go as fast as the silver one was moving.;33.9238;-84.3869
