PD));2014-12-12 12:40:00;3.6 minutes;After getting off from work, I took out my garbage.  Looking up towards the west, I noticed an object that flashed from white to green to red.   I recorded it for about three minutes and thirty eight seconds.  It moved like no other craft that I've seen before.  It made no sound and it was like turning off a light when it was gone.;34.1875399999999;-84.8142093333334
