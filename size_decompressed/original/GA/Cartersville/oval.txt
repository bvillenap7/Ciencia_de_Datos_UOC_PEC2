Large oval object in red top mountains.;2014-06-24 06:13:00;13;Large oval object in red top mountains. At 06:12, I was opening the gate to the facility I work at.  After opening the gate, I spotted three other people who was at the park that is located in front of the facility, staring out eat at the mountain  line.   When I went to see what they were staring at the pointed out a large bright oval disk.  It seem to have stood still.   Through closer inspection, it appeared to be metallic and glowing in a yellow tint.  After 10 min of observation it faded behind the clouds and was gone out of sight.;34.1875399999999;-84.8142093333334
