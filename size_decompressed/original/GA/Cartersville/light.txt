40+ strange lights over cartersville georgia;2013-12-12 19:50:00;5 minutes;40+ strange lights over cartersville georgia Was heading to work and as I topped the hill on peeples valley rd next to tractor farm supply I seen a strange bunch of lights.  At first thought street lights or office building lights but we don't have any buildings that high.  My brother on the opposite end of town also spotted these.  They weren't meteors from Ty Geminid shower or flares or fireworks or nothing explainable to my knowledge.  Dispersed after about five minutes.  They were a reddish orange or amber color if you prefer.  They were somewhat in a formation but mostly just looked scattered;34.1875399999999;-84.8142093333334
