HE ,HIS WIFE AND THERE TWO DAUGHTERS (16 AND 10 YEARS OLD) WERE IN THE CAR. AS I STARTED TO GET IN MY BROTHER WAS GETTING OUT. HE DREW MY ATTENTION TO THE EAST. WHERE WE ALL SAW 4 BRIGHT DOTS IN THE SKY THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE CLOUDS. THEY PASSED THROUGH THE OPENING AND WENT BEHIND ANOTHER CLOUD.THEN WE SAW A HALF CIRCLE FORMATION OF DOTS FOLLOWED BY A DIAMOND SHAPE FORMATION OF DOTS. WE CONTINUED TO WACTCH AS VARIOUS PATTERNS, AND RANDOM DOTS MOVED ACROSS THE OPENINGS IN THE CLOUDS. THIS CONTINUED FOR 10 TO 12 MINUTES. WE FINALLY GOT INTO THE CAR AND DROVE 20 MILES TO A RESTURANT. WHEN WE ARRIVED AND I GOT OUT OF THE CAR THERE WAS A SMALL OPENING IN THE CLOUDS.I WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS AND SAW 2 ADDITIONAL DOTS PASS ACROSS THE OPENING. THESE DOTS WER ALUMINATED BY THE SUN ONE  AND A HALF HOURS AFTER SUNSET SO THEY HAD TO BE EXTREMELY HIGH AND WERE MOVING ROUGHLY EAST TO WEST AT ABOUT 5 TIMES AS FAST AS A JET PLANE MOVES ACROSS THE SKY.I MADE INQUIRES THE NEXT DAY AND WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TV STATIONS SAID THEY HADNT HAD ANY REPORTS;34.1875399999999;-84.8142093333334
Fireball over Lake Allatoona, Cartersville GA;2013-11-16 22:30:00;1 minute;Fireball over Lake Allatoona, Cartersville GA I was with a some friends atop a houseboat after dinner, enjoying the view of Lake Allatoona in Cartersville, Georgia.  Our little group is comprised of seniors, aged 54 to 70.  The men had retired and we four ladies were chatting, when Susie said excitedly, what is that?!!  We all jumped up to see a fireball coming toward us from high over the dam.  As it came closer it stopped and hovered, almost as if it had seen us and hesitated, then reversed direction and disappeared quickly.  We thought it was going very fast or, perhaps, turned its lights off.   In all my 64 years I had never seen anything like it.;34.1875399999999;-84.8142093333334
