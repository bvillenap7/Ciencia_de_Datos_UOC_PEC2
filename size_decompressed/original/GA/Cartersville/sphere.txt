Slow moving fireball in the sky.;2012-06-16 23:00:00;15 mins;slow moving fireball in the sky. me and my son were sittin outside on potio. i noticed an odd orange ball of light.  it was moving like a plane or helicoptor, but looked like it was on fire.it traveled across te sky from south to north west. it took 15 mins to move out of sight. normal aircraft make the same trip in about 2 mins. as it got closer to us it appeared to be on fire, u could even see the flame tails. there was no sound from it.  A small plane coming from the north actually change course to either avoid it or to get a better view.  At this time the craft changed corse and dropped down below the tree line.;34.1875399999999;-84.8142093333334
