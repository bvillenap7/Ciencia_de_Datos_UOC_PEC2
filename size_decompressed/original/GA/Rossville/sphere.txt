Light blue orb that flashed and flew in multi direction without a sound.;2018-09-15 20:30:00;3 minutes;Light blue orb that flashed and flew in multi direction without a sound. Was standing in my driveway about to go to dinner with my fiancee and friend from Australia, my fiancee was inside finishing up getting ready, when I was standing outside of my friends car looking in the sky to the South and talking to her saying look there is the space station.  She said awe ive never seen that before I have seen it and known what it was for a long time looks like a star moving slowly across the sky.  I told her me and my fiancee always look at the stars looking for ufos and satalites and of course the space station.   Right as I got done talking about that there was a orb of light that flashed with no sound i said look as we both looked it flew about half mile in the sky in the blink of the eye,it flashed again and my friend said what in the world was that as it was much brighter and lower than the space station, i said idk then it flashed again then flew down couple hundred feet.  Then out of no where without a sound flew off like a shooting s! tar. I was totally amazed as was she.  Finally ive seen a real ufo dont know if it was extra terrestrial but i do know it wasn't a plane, shooting star, helicopter, or anything close to human possibilities.  It was a light blue color and orb shape and flew in multi direction.  You just know when you've seen something u can't debunk or explain.  Hope its not the last time I get to experience it.;34.9578;-85.3011999999999
