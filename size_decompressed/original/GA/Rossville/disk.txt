Was bright light bluish/yelllowish/orange light hovering then moved top another spot.  seen same thing twice on same spot.;2013-09-01 21:00:00;20-25 minutes;was bright light bluish/yelllowish/orange light hovering then moved top another spot.  seen same thing twice on same spot I was outside by the porch looking up towards the tree at the opposite side of my house, when i saw the bunch of light (like round) hovering over the tree, it sit there and spin around several times.  Calling my wife and pointing to her saying it is the same ligh i saw in June of this year,  me calling it a UFO, my wife contradicts it by saying that it is a helicopter.  told her to listen hard if she could hear a sound and there was no sound she said.  reminded her of the last time i saw it and showed her.  she left and went back in the house.  calling her back out to the porch again,  told her to look up and told her that the UFO has moved.  i went down the road to follow the UFO and told her to get the camera and bring it to me.  i took two pics of the object which i call UFO.  my wife's reaction was complete surprise when she saw it hovering again over our friends house by the trees.  we stayed a little longer watching then went home.  coz it just disappeared quickly before our eyes..  that night was a moonless and not much stars on the sky and the neighbors dogs were barking.;34.9578;-85.3011999999999
