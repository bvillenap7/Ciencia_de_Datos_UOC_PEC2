They were going in a strait line from Lookout Mountain area over the city of Rossville.  I would say they were satellites but I am unsure.  At first I thought it could be a meteor shower.  We start watch alot and Venus has been very bright in the night skit this month. It was very cloudy and cold tonight.  We could see then coming from the area Venus is in and going seemingly upward in a strait path.  It just looked like stars moving across the sky.  We called other purple in the area who was seeing the event as well.;34.9578;-85.3011999999999
