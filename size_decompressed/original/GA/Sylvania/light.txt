Bright orange lights in the sky with no noise.;2005-11-07 20:00:00;30 min;Bright orange lights in the sky with no noise. At 8:00 pm est myself and three others were standing in a cotton field we had just finished picking.  All lights and equipment was off and we were standing there talking when above the tree line to the south of us a bright orange light appeared above the tree line.  After about 30 seconds another one appeared next to it.  The lights stayed stationary for 2 min.  Then the lights just went out.     Ten mins later in the same spot it appeared again with the same duration.  Five mins later about 45 degrees to the right of the orginal lights one light appeared then a second and third formed in a straight line folled by a forth that appeared below these.  The duration was about 30 seconds then the light went out.  There was no sound and no movement other than the forth that asended under the last three.  The lights were very bright orange like a spot light. the was no sound.  On a side note upon returning home my wife at 6:30 pm est stated while at my son's soccer game herself and the other mothers saw two bright orange lights in the horizon towards town that lasted for several mins before asending upwards.;32.7461;-81.6256
