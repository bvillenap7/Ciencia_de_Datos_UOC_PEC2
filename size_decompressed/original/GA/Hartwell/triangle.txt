PILOT REPORT:  3 dim orange lights in triangle formation moving at high speed before separating in different directions.;2014-01-12 20:15:00;10 seconds;3 dim orange lights in triangle formation moving at high speed before separating in different directions. I went outside to walk the dogs and looked up to see 3 dim orange lights in a triangle formation moving rapidly in a westerly direction.  Each light looked like this, II, and were on each corner. I'm a Medevac pilot and estimate its altitude at approx 2000 ft above ground level and traveling at between 150 & 200 knots.  I viewed it at a 45-50 degree angle, giving it an approx distance of 0.5 nm south of my house and heading westbound over downtown Hartwell. Within 5-10 seconds of seeing it, it either rotated clockwise or the lights separated and went in different directions.  After this it disappeared from view.  The whole time it was completely silent. Weather conditions were clear at the time with little to no wind.;34.3508;-82.9224
