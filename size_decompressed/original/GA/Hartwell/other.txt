Bright green flash and green smoke trail;2013-08-06 23:20:00;10 seconds;Bright green flash and green smoke trail I was sneaking out to see my boyfriend and it was about 11:20pm it was partly cloudy but a full moon so you could see clouds from the moonlight, but at the time it was fairly dark and as I was sitting there in the dark waiting the sky all of a sudden lit up lime green like a flash of lightning would light up the sky and for some reason I looked northwest and I saw what looked to be a meteor falling through the clouds very far away, but it was still huge and it was leaving a lime green smoke trail.   I did not hear anything on the news anywhere about it, or anyone talking about it.;34.3508;-82.9224
