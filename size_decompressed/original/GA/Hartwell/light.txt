I saw a rather big white light which I took for a planet or possibly a star at WNW. ((NUFORC Note:  Intl. Space Station sighting.  PD));2008-08-06 21:45:00;2 - 3 mins;Last night about a quarter till 10 pm I stepped out on the back deck for a cigarette.  And while I was out there I was just gazing up at the sky (it was a clear night).  I saw a rather big white light which I took for a planet or possibly a star at WNW (west, northwest) direction. But then I noticed it was moving into my direction at a rather slow pace, in a straight line.  I’d guess maybe 60 to 70 mph. This big white light never flashed or pulsed like you see on airplanes.  There were no red or green lights,  so I know it wasn’t a plane.  The closer the object got I noticed it wasn’t making any sound.  It went over our house and still never heard a sound.  I went around to the other side of the house and saw it again moving south east.  I kept watching it, then all of a sudden the light went dim really quick and disappeared.  It never lit back up.  I don’t know what this was, but thought it to be really strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Intl. Space Station sighting.  PD));34.3508;-82.9224
