Bright Eye In the Sky:  object spotted in the clear a.m. hours of the sky and caught on camera!;2004-07-07 04:00:00;2-3hrs;Bright Eye In the Sky:  object spotted in the clear a.m. hours of the sky and caught on camera! First let me start by saying that I am highly skeptical of the whole UFO idea but I am open to the possibility that they might exist.  On the morning of July 7th, 2004 while on a break at the local hospital I noticed in the sky a very bright light glowing in the sky.  The light appeared sort of orange in color and resembles the sort of light one would expect to see on an approaching helicopter, the light was stationary in one area for about 2 1/2 hours.  I work security at the hospital and have access to the surveillance cameras at the facility, so I went inside and decided to position the cameras skyward to see if I could get a better and closer view of the object.  Once I fixed the cameras on the object and zoom in on it the object appeared to be a bright circle with another circle inside of it, I then focus the view of the camera to view as near as possible and the object appeared to glow outward from the center and had the appearance of a huge eye.  The sky was clear and stars could easily be viewed by natural eye but this object appeared closer than the stars.  I took pictures of the object on the camera with my picture phone.  I don't know if this is a UFO or a natural phenomenon of some sort, but I am definitely sure it was not an airplane or manmade craft.  I am sending via email some pictures of the object, the photos will be EyeNSky1 and EyeNSky2.;31.4718878048781;-82.8529975609756

Took dog out to use bathroom. I looked up for the moon and noticed what I thought was a star but then realized that it was moving very fast and with no sound. It took about 15 seconds to get from one horizon to the other. This was not a jet or satellite or the space station. It was very bright, very fast and silent.;31.4718878048781;-82.8529975609756
