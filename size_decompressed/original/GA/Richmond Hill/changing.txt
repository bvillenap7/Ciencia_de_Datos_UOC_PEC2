Very Bright object in morning sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Venus??  PD));2007-11-15 06:13:00;3 minutes;Very Bright object in morning sky. Early Thursday morning I got out of bed to get ready for work. I usually step out back to take my morning coffee break before getting ready for work.  That’s  what I did and to my amazement something caught my eye in the southeast sky.  A very bright light that was moving in a zig zag motion .  My first instinct was to wake everyone up to see what I was seeing so I wouldn’t feel like a nut case. So I stepped in and woke up my oldest son to check it out with me. I also grabbed my digital camera to take some shots.  I was able to take four pictures before it started to get even brighter and then slowly take off pretty much straight up  into the early morning clouds.  The pictures look like a swirley bright light. There was no apparent sound that we could hear .  So we went inside to check out the pictures knowing that we had witnessed an actual U F O.  My son and I know they are real, now what they are?  I don’t know.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Venus??  PD));31.8962;-81.294
