It obviously wasn't a star and it was far up in the sky maybe a few more miles above the atmosphere, it was heading north then disappeared.  Another one towards the West started moving and again disappeared.  At first I said it was a satellite but my husband said that they would not be going at such a pace as we were seeing them go by.  So I checked the satellite radar and it said there was only one in Adel ga but we live in quitman ga.  But it didnt stop there we saw three more lights flying across the sky all heading in different directions.  They werent comets or asteroids because if that were to be the case they would leave a faint quick trail when burning up in the atmosphere.  But the lights were just passing by no flickers or trail just moving before quickly vanishing.  Also mentioning the fact that the lights were moving! as if being directed towards certain directions and while this happened flashes of light occurred with no signs of clouds anywhere it was clear but the flashes came from the sky itself which we found strange.;30.7782;-83.5519
