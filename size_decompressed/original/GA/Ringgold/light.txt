Green Light in the Sky.;2014-12-14 21:23:00;Few seconds;Green Light in the Sky. My wife and I were driving down the interstate towards the Cloud Springs Rd exit and directly in front of us in the sky flew a green ball of light from left to right, which I believe is East to West.  It was very visible, and my wife actually thought it may have been a crashing plane until I reminded her that planes don't glow green.  I imagine it may have been a meteor burning in the atmosphere, but I wanted to report it anyway.  It was brilliant, and the first time I've seen something like this so clearly.;34.9213;-85.1486
