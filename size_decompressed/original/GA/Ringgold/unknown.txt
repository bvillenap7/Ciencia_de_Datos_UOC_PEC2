Stationary twinkling lights .;2007-09-23 22:00:00;45 minutes;Stationary twinkling lights . At around 10 pm while taking my dogs out before going to bed I noticed an unusual “star” in the northeast. It was flickering red and green lights and was unlike any other stars in the sky. I called for my husband to come and see and he was just as perplexed as I. We watched it for 30 to 45 minutes and it did not move. I used a pair of binoculars and got a good view of the lights but couldn’t make out a shape. I will be purchasing a telescope or stronger binoculars very soon. The next night I looked to see if it could’ve been some type of tower or something that I had never noticed before. There was nothing there. A few years ago I posted a sighting that happened many years ago in 1975 in another state. Because of that sighting I became very watchful of the night sky. My husband on the other hand has always been a skeptic but even he said the lights in the sky couldn’t have been a plane because they were in one spot for so long. He is becoming more interested. I am a factory worker and my husband is a truck driver locally for a major carrier. I have 2 grown sons. One is an attorney and the other has served in the Airforce.;34.9213;-85.1486
Fast moving white light with a smaller red light in the rear very high in the sky.;2011-10-14 00:00:00;20 min;Fast moving white light with a smaller red light in the rear very high in the sky. I looked up at the full moon and saw a bright object moving at a high rate of speed near the moon.  It was quite bright, perhaps because it was reflecting the full moon and white with a smaller red light in the rear.   It was too high to be a plane and moved too quickly to be a planet or star.   I got my brother and he said it could have been the space station but it moved really fast and I don't think the space station could move that quickly.  I have no idea what it was.
