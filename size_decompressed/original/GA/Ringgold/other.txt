Object slowing moving East to West, 7 white lights in a straight line, No Sound.;2014-05-01 21:15:00;5 minutes;Object slowing moving East to West, 7 white lights in a straight line, No Sound Around 9:00pm on Thursday, 5/1/14, I noticed an object in the sky just above the tree line in the field behind our home.  The object had 7 white lights that were evenly spaced across the large line.  At times the lights would blink in a pattern, while other times the blinking was more random. The object moved very slowly in a straight line East to West across the field. It didnâ€™t make a sound and was very large.  My husband tried to capture it on his phone, although the quality of the image is lacking.  Eventually, the object moved further West toward Chickamauga, GA, and crept out of our viewing area.  Most of my friends and family seem a little unsure of our story, but I was so relieved to see that another Ringgold, GA, resident reported the sighting as well.  I hope to see it again, and next time I will have my camera ready!  Truly a moment my husband and I will never forget!
