SMALL CHROME OR SILVER (VERY SHINY) OBJECTS (10-16) FLYING IN V FORMATION, NORTH GA.;2008-01-08 15:00:00;1-2 MINUTES;SMALL CHROME OR SILVER (VERY SHINY) OBJECTS (10-16) FLYING IN V FORMATION, NORTH GA JAN 8TH, 2008, APPROX 1500 HRS. AS I WAS TAKING DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF CHEMTRAILS IN THE SKY OVER MY HOUSE, I WAS LOOKING TO THE EAST.  A FLYING V SHAPE FLYING TOWARDS ME CAUGHT MY EYE. IT LOOKED LIKE A  FORMATION OF GEESE AT FIRST, BUT THE OBJECTS WERE VERY SHINY. IT APPEARED TO MY EYES THAT THEY WERE SILVER OR CHROME COLORED, FLYING AT SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET, AND MOVED FAST ENOUGH SO THAT I WAS ONLY ABLE TO CAPTURE 4 PHOTOS OF THE FORMATION. THEY HAD A MECHANICAL MOVEMENT  ABOUT THEM VS LIVE FLIGHT MECHANICS AS IN A BIRD OR ANIMAL. THEY MADE NO NOISE, AND FLEW FROM THE EAST TO THE NORTHWEST VERY QUICKLY. I THOUGHT TO MYSELF UPON INITIALLY SEEING THEM, THESE HAVE TO BE GEESE BECAUSE OF THE V FORMATION, BUT INSTANTLY REALIZED THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN GEESE THAT WERE SHINY SILVER OR CHROME IN COLOR. I HAVE INCLUDED 4 DIGITAL PHOTOS OF WHAT I SAW. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.9213;-85.1486
