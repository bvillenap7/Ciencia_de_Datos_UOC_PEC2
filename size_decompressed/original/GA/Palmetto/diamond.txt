Palmetto, GA.  Diamond a couple of seconds  a glowing diamond shaped object  picture taken 19 April 2005 at 1950 EST;2005-04-19 19:50:00;2 or 3 seconds;Palmetto, GA.  Diamond a couple of seconds  a glowing diamond shaped object  picture taken 19 April 2005 at 1950 EST I was comparing two different megapixel cameras to see the difference in sharpness.  The Sony Cybershot DSC-P52 3.2mp camera was used to compare it against a Canon 330D 6.3mp camera.   When I framed the picture of the sky with clouds and an aircraft in it I noticed a twinkling object through the view finder as I pushed the shutter button.  The resultant picture shows a diamond shaped object in front of some clouds.   I was aiming the camera at about 35 degrees above the horizon (to avoid my roof line) and was facing almost due East.   I have noticed another object in the picture in the clouds on the right side of the picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Photo indicated a light-colored, diamond-shaped object.  We do not know what the object is.  PD));33.5236;-84.675
