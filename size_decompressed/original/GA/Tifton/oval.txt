While sitting outside on break at work i observed an object in the sky.  At first i thought it to be a low flying plane moving very slow but as i continued to look at it a plane,helicopter, blimp, balloon nor kite it was not.  For it was round oval like in shape silver or chrome like in color with a dark or black like trim near it's middle.  This thing was spinning or slightly wobbling and its movement seem to cause a blur like haze around it to me.   Now on this day the weather was prefect beautiful i mean clear blue skies i don't recall a cloud in the sky.  Altitude i have to guess about 2000ft coming from an southern direction moving north maybe 1/5 mile from me, making no sound at all.  Then it dawned on me what this could be... a real u.f.o. i stood up and walked over to the wall of our break area just wanting to look at it even more...in a western direction to my astonishment i mean to my amazement ZOOM it just took off.In lest than a second it was gone..  gone from my view,gone from the sky  GONE.   I saw this with mine own two eyes i saw this.  Told only a few at my job i trusted just did not want to be ridiculed.   On this day 04/05/11 at my place of work i witness something i feel was truly amazing, wonderful...and maybe out of this world.;31.4596170731707;-83.5278243902439

We were in our backyard when it was seen.;31.4596170731707;-83.5278243902439
