Large spark-like lights;2020-02-21 19:30:00;3 minutes;Large spark-like lights Saw a large flash of light (two beside each other) that became larger as if it were headlights of an aircraft about to land in the interstate) but it quickly went away.  There was a red flashing light that appeared to be the aircraft that quickly let off another light that looked the same (more visible and looked like a large spark).  The craft then quickly went to its right then quickly turned and went south.  Sharply turned.  We saw a very bright light (like a bright star) shortly afterwards in the same direction that just disappeared.;31.4596170731707;-83.5278243902439
