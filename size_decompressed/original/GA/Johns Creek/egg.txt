Have nothing but cheap binoculars but again it is roundish, more like an egg but there is a very bright object/light that is traveling up and down on the left side of the ufo. It is so bright that again, just like previous times, your eye is drawn to it in the sky (not overhead in the sky).  The first time I thought it was the light from a jet, but realized it was not later due to the motion.  I can clearly see this off my porch and tonight I can hear some people a street over out appearing to be looking up at it also. I used my cell phone the 2nd time, but on video play it looks like a bright light in the sky. This is the 3rd night I have seen this in about 5-6 months.   During the summer, I watched one eve before it got dark a light in the same vicinity travel behind the clouds and illuminate the clouds and travel out to the edge of a cloud and go up and down and back behind it again. I have seen one other (very close and very unusual), as reported directly to mufon people in the area) unexplained object/entity in this past year. There is definitely something in this area and my dogs sense it also. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.02685;-84.19325
