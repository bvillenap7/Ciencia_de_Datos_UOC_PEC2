UFO over North Atlanta Ga Town;2003-08-20 22:00:00;8-10min;UFO over North Atlanta Ga Town This event took place after 10pm (I had just closed my store and was heading south to the local video store to drop off a rental about a mile & a half away)It was a clear night on a week night as I drove south towards the video store I notice a dark rounded triangle shaped craft moving very slow about 250 - 300 yards above the tree line.  The object was travailing north towards me and then made a slow but hard left almost making a u-turn heading south west.   I watched as the object traveled south west, noticing no sound coming from craft.  I notice 4 large round shaped lights underneath the craft, one on each corner and one in the center of the craft, the three corner lights were bright white and center was more of a cool blue.   As I got closer the object began to descend and stopped just above the tree line just left of me behind a car shop, about 50 - 75 yards away from me.  I pulled over and go out of my car.  I noticed a thin red line that wrapped around the c! raft.   At first I thought it was some sort of hot air balloon...for the next 2 - 3 min it hovered over the tree line..  I noticed a few cars slowing down, people looking up at the craft and the racing off.  Still I was not thinking alien craft, i just kept thinking this is some secret military craft.   I went back to my car to grab my digital camera and as I positioned myself to take a photo of the craft the object suddenly accelerated instantly, almost at a lightning speed straight up.  I could see it travel into space and at that moment I knew this was an out of this world craft (Alien UFO) I have only told a hand full of people, but have for the most part kept it to myself.
