Red fireballs moving silently and intelligently.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date not indicated by witness, who remains anonymous.  PD));2020-08-21 22:00:00;5 minutes;Red fireballs moving silently and intelligently My wife left to pick up our son at work around 2200.  She notices a red orb in the sky about 200ft moving slowly across the sky.  Within 10 seconds a second fireball orb approached the 1st orb quickly.  Both stopped.  My wife felt they were aware she was observing them.  That scared her.  She did get pictures.  Both fireball orbs took off parallel from one another moving at the same speed over neighborhoods.  No sound, no outline of a drone arm or propellers.  Just fireballs moving intelligently. ((NUFORC Note:  Date not indicated by witness, who remains anonymous.  PD));34.02685;-84.19325
