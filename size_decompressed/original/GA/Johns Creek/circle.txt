Reddish light hanging over Atlanta.;2016-04-22 22:30:00;10 minutes +;Reddish light hanging over Atlanta. Walked to my car after work around 10:30 PM, saw a reddish light hanging in the air. Looked almost like a flare, same color, but did not fall from the sky.  Watched for a bit then drove off.  Seemed to hang in the sky, moved subtly but not much.  Went in many directions, but again, not by much.;34.02685;-84.19325

Flashing grey ufo sighting;2020-06-25 22:30:00;1 minute;Flashing grey ufo sighting The object seemed to be a grey circle.  It was flashing a green light about every 2 seconds and it moved in a zig zag form.  I even have footage.  At a certain point it even zoomed up and down.  It moved across my horizon and left after it went behind the trees in front of my house. I am 90 percent sure it is not a airplane because of the way it moved.  Thank you for your time.  (It was not a firefly because this object was way to far for a firefly to be viewable);34.02685;-84.19325
