Two objects in night sky over Georgia fly laterally, hover, ascend vertically out of sight;2013-08-10 21:52:00;3:00;Two objects in night sky over Georgia fly laterally, hover, ascend vertically out of sight This evening at 9:52P ET...getting out of the car my wife and I noticed what appeared to be a plane heading toward us...it separated into two lights and I realized there were two objects...then one disappeared...figured it was a plane turning so the lights went out...the one still visible continued toward us...no flashing lights only solid.   Then it stopped and went vertical into the clouds...the second set of lights that had previously disappeared reappeared and moved to approximately the same position of the first lights and also went vertical out of sight.   My wife shot some video with her camera and also tried to zoom in...I've taken the zoomed in pix and further enlarged the pix.  Doesn't look like any aircraft I've evet seen before. approx. location witnessed 34 03 30 55N    84 14 02 92W;34.02685;-84.19325
