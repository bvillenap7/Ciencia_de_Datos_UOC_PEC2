Something looking like a very bright, large star was seen in the sky at about 21:15.  It was positioned very low in the sky, compared to the stars.  It was at least 5 times bigger in diameter than the brightest star in the sky seen that night.  It didn’t move from its position for about 30-45 minutes (or maybe longer I can only estimate from the time when I spotted it).  I saw it during my night walk and went back to check on it a couple times (it could only be seen from the hill near my house).  When I went to check on it again after 22:00, it wasn’t there anymore.;34.02685;-84.19325
