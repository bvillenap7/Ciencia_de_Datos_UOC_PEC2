Spherical Object Sighted above the clouds at Johns Creek, GA.  ((anonymous report));2016-10-20 16:05:00;7 minutes;Spherical Object Sighted above the clouds at Johns Creek, GA On Friday afternoon at 4pm, I noticed a bright white spherical object above normal approach aircraft traffic to Atlanta.  I estimate the object was above 20 thousand feet.  The day was sunny with very few clouds. The object was headed south in the direction of Atlanta City above the clouds.  At times the object reflected sunlight as it was a sunny afternoon.  I observed the object for about 7 to 10 minutes.  The object was moving at a steady rate of speed in the direction of Atlanta.  It did not move in an erratic way. There were no visible lights on the object.  It appeared to be the exact same color as the white clouds.  Eventually the object disappeared as I could no longer see it due to it's height and distance from me. The object was not easy to see.  I happened to notice it as I was watching an aircraft overfly my location.  The aircraft that overflew my location was a fly-over not on approach to Atlanta. The spherical shape just happened to catch my eye as it was bright white and well above the fly-over aircraft.  While the object appeared spherical in shape the bottom of the object appeared to be of a saucer shape and had a somewhat grey color.  The object was significantly higher than the flyover at my location but was not moving at the same rate of speed.

Follow up from earlier post of a sighting reported at Johns Creek.;2016-10-21 16:00:00;7  minutes;Follow up from earlier post of a sighting reported at Johns Creek. Hello, earlier I had reported an object that I had sighted at Johns Creek, GA.  I just want to follow up with you.  A person had posted a video taken near the BB&T tower in downtown Atlanta near Atlantic Station on 10/25/2016 at 3:45pm. The object in the video is what I saw that I had reported earlier on 10/21/2016. It is difficult to make it out in the video, can be seen faintly above the bb&t building on the right hand side of the building. Thanks.
