Black triangle seen on country back road.  ((anonymous report);2017-12-12 18:25:00;~5 seconds;Black triangle seen on country back road Driving to downtown Waynesboro, GA, from near Vogtle nuclear plant, I received a text message, upon looking up from my phone I saw the silhouette of a large black triangle that appeared to be hovering about 200ft off the ground a short way down the road from me over a field to my left.   This triangle had orange lights that blinked from one side to the other in various brightness.  The lights began fading and the craft disappeared shortly after, but didnâ€™t appear to have moved anywhere, it just faded away.
