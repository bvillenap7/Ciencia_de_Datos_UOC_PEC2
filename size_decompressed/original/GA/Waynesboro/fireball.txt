Second type: large golf ball to basket ball sized bright orange glowing orbs or fireballs..... they appeared 3 in row when I first saw them diagnally....they dimmed disappeared and then reappeared in a triangle....the disappeared and came back only this time there was 7 or 8 of them and formed a prefect circle in complete unison with one another...then scattered from the circle moving swiftly around, up down, side to side.....  Then all but a few would disappear and the ones still visible where completely still just dimming off and on  Myself and a family member witnessed this as we where enjoying a cigarette on my front porch.  We started to witness this at about 7:15 pm...  I do not where glasses or contacts my other witness does...  There was no noise coming from these and weather was cold but no wind...  There was no smoke coming from these lights so there for it didn't leave any trail..  Neither of us have been drinking or on any drugs!!!!  This was real what we saw and can't be explained!!!
