At least 7 fireball type objects in the sky over Evans (Augusta) GA.;2013-07-13 21:30:00;~4 minutes;At least 7 fireball type objects in the sky over Evans (Augusta) GA. At approximately 9:30 PM EST on the night of July 13, 2013, I was standing outside the front of my hose in Evans, GA.  Directly in front of me to the south, I saw a bright orange ball of light, almost flame like, moving upward at a fairly steep angle, rapidly heading south west.  Within what seemed to be maybe a matter of twenty seconds or so, I saw two more come up back to back and do the exact same thing.   My next door neighbor was coming out of his front door about this time and we saw this same thing happen multiple times.  With the sheer amazement of what we were seeing neither of us could honestly say how many there actually were.  Our best conclusion was at least seven in total.  I can not speculate nor even guess at an approximate speed. Growing up, my father was a fighter pilot in the USAF.  After retiring continued his career in aviation.  I my self have  done my share of private flying.  I feel that I can honestly say that I have been around enough fast planes to know that these were no airplanes.  It almost looked as if missiles were being launched.  I thought at the time about the possibility of fireworks.  There never were any explosions.  I went as far as calling 911 non emergency to see if anyone else had reported this event while it was taking place.  The dispatcher I spoke with was not aware at the time of any calls.   I am not one of the types of people that says it's aliens.  I am simply writing to repot about the extremely strange objects in the sky that we saw.;33.5385000000001;-82.1408
Was called by a coworker, to my surprise, 5 balls of red light moving from E to W in the sky.  ((anonymous));2016-04-15 19:00:00;8 minutes;During work was called by a coworker, to my surprise, 5 balls of red light moving from east to west in the sky and after 40-50 seconds turning orange and then slowly disappearing into the sky.   After the 5 balls of light disappear, another wave comes with at least 9-10 more in a line moving fast and close with the same pattern and disappearance.   Stopped after 8 or 9 minutes.
