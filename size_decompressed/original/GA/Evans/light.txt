This past Tuesday I was out back, having let the dogs out one last time when I noticed that the sky was uncommonly clear.  So much so that the stars were twinkling.   I then noticed what I first thought was a satellite because of its altitude and that it was also sparkling. A moment later I changed my mind because it was moving too fast.  That and it changed its course.  Several times. In ways that a plane can’t.  There’s also that satellites don’t change course.;33.5385000000001;-82.1408
