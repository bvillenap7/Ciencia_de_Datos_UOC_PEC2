It was a random sunny day, at a red light near my daughters old high school. The only reason it caught my eye is because it sparkled. It drew my eyes to the left and it looked strange to me like a piece of Christmas candy. Round in the middle and almost triangles on each side.  I looked close and it was way up there way higher than a drone is supposed to be but it looked like a mirror on the bottom which is what made it sparkle reflecting off the sun.  It turned from what looked like it’s side, back flat I was snapping pix even the pix aren’t clear but I was freaking out.  The light changed to green and I started moving slowly and it stayed to my right I rolled down the windows, heard nothing.  I kept trying to take pictures. I couldn’t tell if the iphone was even working.  Suddenly it completely disappeared and reappeared I snapped several times, realizing I was swerving.  I pulled over and hopped out to get a better look and to be more still.  That makes cleaner shots, I’m a photographer. In the matter of seconds I hopped out of my car and it was gone.  I waited 5 minutes saw nothing.  Went home, thinking I didn’t get anything. You can barely see it, but when it disappeared it made a circle shape like a big clear bubble would look in a picture.  It was freaky cool! I googled all drone shapes none of them looked like this and it was so far up it had to be big. It sparkled!;33.5385000000001;-82.1408
