Round bright objects seen in the sky over Thomas County;2016-05-13 22:00:00;30 minutes;Round bright objects seen in the sky over Thomas County Out walking the dogs with my husband and happened to look up.  It was a clear night.  Saw two or three round bright flickering objects in the sky moving towards the East sky.  When we both looked to the direction they were heading there were anywhere from 20-30 additional sized objects following in the same direction together, but not in any uniform pattern.  We watched them for approximately 15 to 20 minutes before they disappeared beyond the trees.  My husband and I discussed it again today and still have no idea what we saw.  If it wasn't for the speed of the two or three objects trying to catch up to the group, we thought maybe they were lighted balloons or lanterns that people let off into the sky, but they were too far up in the sky.  We heard no sounds of planes or saw any in the area at the time of this sighting.  I am a skeptical person as my husband is as well and we really saw something that was really unexplainable.  We know what we saw, and tried to! video record it with our phones, but they were too far up in the sky to get a good recording.   Never had this happen before.   We are in our 50's and professional individuals, and are stunned to say the least. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
