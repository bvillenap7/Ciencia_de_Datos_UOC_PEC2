PD);2010-11-21 14:34:00;4 minutes;Three lobed, colorful sphere moving slowly at low altitude and then changing shape. On November 21, 2010 at 2:34 pm, my son was standing in the driveway of his mother’s house taking pictures of their cat.  It was a sunny, clear day and the temperature was approximately 50 degrees winds were calm and humidity levels were average for the time of year. While shooting photos of the cat, my son noticed an object moving across the sky. The object was traveling in a northward direction, its altitude was approximately 300-400 feet, it moved at around 20-30mph and it was maintaining level flight. It was completely silent.  He managed to take six photos of the object before it passed out of sight. He described it as having three lobes with a domed structure in its center.  Each lobe was a different color, or seemed to be and the object morphed into a y shape as it moved farther away. I asked him if he thought it might be a balloon, but he was absolutely certain that it was not.  The manner in which the object traveled and how it changed shape convinced him that it was a craft of some sort.  He told me he was actually frightened when he first saw it. With photo analysis, the size of the object could be determined, but that’s not something my son and I have pursued. I am emailing his photos with this report.  I have, however, manipulated what I think to be the best picture in the group in an attempt to bring out better detail and increase sharpness.  I’m no expert in digital photo composition, but I used Adobe Photoshop to produce the final edited image. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible cluster of balloons?  PD);33.4035;-84.6559000000001
