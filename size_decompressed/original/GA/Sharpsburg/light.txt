The formation to our left was 3 lights side by side in one line with 2 other lights below them in the same formation.  The formation on the right of those 5 were three in the formation of a triangle.  They just faded away one by one into the night sky.

Driving in car around dusk there were multiple (10-20) bright lights hovering fairly high in the sky.  No clouds to speak of at the time so they were pretty clear.  The road turned and trees blocked the view (looking south) and when that part of the sky came back into view, the lights were gone.  Saw a clip from the Outerbanks that looked exactly like what I saw the next day.;33.4035;-84.6559000000001
