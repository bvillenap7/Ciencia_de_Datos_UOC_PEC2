Bright round object in southeastern sky in Georgia.;2014-10-09 18:30:00;1 hour;Bright round object in southeastern sky in Georgia I was on my back deck and I noticed a bright round object in the southeastern sky.  I stopped moving around and just stared at it for a while.  I called to my wife to come and look at it as well and we couldn't figure out what it was. I told her to watch it as I went in the house to get my camera.  I took a couple of pictures of it and then sat down and watched it for about an hour.  During this time, it was moving slowly to the south and was getting further away. It was a bright white/silver round shape.  The sky was quite clear and this object really stood out with the blue sky.;33.4035;-84.6559000000001
