Strange glowing green object falling from the sky.;2007-01-08 19:00:00;6 seconds;Strange glowing green object falling from the sky. This happened a little over an hour ago, so this report is fresh in my mind. Just around 7 pm, I was driving my car north on highway 24 approximately 2 or 3 miles out of Newington, GA.  I was changing the station on my radio, which had a lot of static.  I don't know if this is significant, but it was more static than usual, even for our remote area.  I then saw a bright green light to the east, falling at a fairly steep angle towards the North Carolina state line, maybe a little closer.  The light fell at a very fast rate, faster than any falling star I've ever seen.  It was also larger than a falling star or meteor I have seen.  It didn't have a trail, so I highly doubt it was a comet.  It was visible for approximately 6 seconds.  I would assume that it was approximately 1000 feet in altitude.  It disappeared fairly close to the tree line across the field I saw the light appear above.;32.581;-81.4826
