Object chasing jet;2008-05-21 13:00:00;around a minute;Object chasing jet At around 1pm, I went outside for a smoke and happened to look up to see a jet moving across the sky from southwest to northeast. Nothing out of the ordinary but then I noticed a white object zig zagging back and forth behind the jet, moving in and out of the contrail. If I had to guess at the distance behind the jet, it would have been about a few thousand feet to as little as a few hundred. The object would suddenly increase in speed and catch up to the jet almost then back off, all the while zig zagging. It would move as far away as several thousand feet out of the contrail on either side of it as well. Then the object appeared to enter the contrail and move straight toward the jet. You could see the clouds/contrail actually be distorted by the object. This went on until I could no longer see the jet or the object and could only barely make out the contrail. It's  a bright sunny day (not a single cloud in the sky) so it made it hard to see as it got further away. I was to the point of being concerned that the object was going to catch and run into the jet.  I'm in a location that sees countless jets fly over during the day as they move out from atlanta to the northeast. I frequently can look up in the sky and see 8 or 10 of them at any given time but I have never seen anything like this.  One of the strangest things I've ever seen.
