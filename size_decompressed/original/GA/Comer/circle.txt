Bright flying light disappears from Northeast Georgia Sky;2011-10-24 19:30:00;10 seconds;Bright flying light disappears from Northeast Georgia Sky I saw what looked like a small aircraft in the darkening sky, it seemed like a bright white round light, moving at a brisk pace, at an altitude of around 3000 ft.  I tracked the light for about 10 seconds until it completely disappeared.  There were no clouds in the sky.  The light did not flicker or drop from the sky, it just disappeared from a clear sky.;34.0928;-83.1214
