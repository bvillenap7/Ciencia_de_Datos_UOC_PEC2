The object shot up from the horizon at an extreme speed, almost whistling as it rose, leaving behind a thin smoke trail that glowed a faint white for about 5 seconds after the object disappeared,  I would personally say the object went about an honest mile into the air in about 2 seconds before it suddenly disappeared and almost got sucked into nothingness.  This object had a defined bright blue rectangular shape soaring with a neon-lime green cone-shaped tip.  This object was massive even in relation to its extreme distance from me and was also extremely bright and lit up the surrounding area with such brightness it was almost equal to a helicopter spotlight, but with a much larger radius shining on the ground.   Sent a true chill and tingle through my body as I was shaken to the core for a reason I could not explain.  Truly a once in a lifetime experience.;34.0928;-83.1214
