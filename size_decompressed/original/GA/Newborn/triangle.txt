I first thougth this may be a satellite or space sation until it was closer i was three ligths on three corners of the object.  It made a 90 degree turn,as t turned I ran and got my cellphone and took a picture of it but by then it was pretty far away.  When i looked at the picture i noticed there was ball of ligth that was not in the ksy when I took the picture. I would include the picture if only i knew how to get online.;33.5166;-83.7116
