The silver object in Newton County.;2004-06-24 22:00:00;10 minutes;The silver object in Newton County. I was driving home at 9:00 p.m. eastern time from marching band practice on Highway 229 just out side of Newborn,Ga. I saw it up above the tree's as I turned onto 229 and the noticeable thing about it was how big it was compared to any other kind of aircraft in fligth. It was glowing and looked like it was made of a platinum like metal. It didn't move for a while as I was driving it just stayed in the same spot. Then as i pulled in and got some binoculars it flashed and flashed off. I had seen airplanes at nigth and all there planes had flashing ligths but this was brigth almost like a second moon and a little lower than the cloud line. It   disapeared when it looked like a plane was headed for it.;33.5166;-83.7116
