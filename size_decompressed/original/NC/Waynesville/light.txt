Near Maggie Valley / Waynesville. We have a house on top of a mountain in the woods. At 11:00 PM, we were outside, looking into the sky for satellites. We see them pretty often. Then, we saw one and about 2 inches behind it, we saw another one following it. It maintained the same distance from the other one. They were like very bright stars. They were moving from Southwest to Northeast the opposite direction of satellites. They moved in that direction for a couple of seconds, then  appeared to turn to the left. They had no blinking lights like an airplane. Their turn to the left may have just been that they turned out toward space because both lights dimmed at that time. They then passed behind a cloud and did not reemerge.;35.507393193717;-82.9902115183239
