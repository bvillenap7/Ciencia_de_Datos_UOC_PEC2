Orange glowing object seen over ocean.;2013-07-09 21:10:00;3 minutes;Orange glowing object seen over ocean While walking along beach, noticed an orange,glowing round object moving slowly in a northerly direction. After about two minutes, object made a 90 degree turn to east and soon disappeared. Sky conditions at time were partly cloudy.   I thought at time that object may had become obscured by clouds, but never saw it reappear.  At no time did I see any strobes or position lights.   I judged object to be several miles out to sea and approximately 1500 feet in altitude.   Several minutes after object disappeared, I saw what was clearly a conventional aircraft moving south toward last sighted position of UFO.   I speculated that it could have been a military aircraft from Norfolk VA area.   There were many other people on beach at time of sighting, but I have no idea if any others noticed that object was unusual.;36.0677;-75.7057
