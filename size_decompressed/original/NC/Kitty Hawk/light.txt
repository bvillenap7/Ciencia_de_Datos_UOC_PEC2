Several bright yellowish lights moving south and gaining altitude until they disappeared.;2013-04-05 20:30:00;4-5 minutes;Several bright yellowish lights moving south and gaining altitude until they disappeared. Saw 4 or 5 yellow lights over the ocean while driving south couple blocks from the beach. They seemed to be a hundred yards above the ocean and about the same distance from shore. Stopped at the beach to get a better look.  A few of them had disappeared, and the remaining we're almost too Hightower be seen.  Two new ones appeared low over the water to the north.  By this time, the remaining original lights had disappeared. The two new ones moved south toward me, gaining altitude until they were no longer visible. It took about two minutes or less for these last two objects to move south past me and rise out of sight. These objects were bright yellowish-orange lights. They did not appear to have any shape other than the light itself. However, the last object I saw the clearest, since I was able to see it at its low altitude. It seemed to have some red in the light. I did not have a camera or phone with me. I have never researched UFOs, seen one, or even believe! d in them (until now).;36.0677;-75.7057
Three orange/ white orbs seen over outer banks.;2014-07-20 21:30:00;30 minutes;Three orange/ white orbs seen over outer banks. Sitting on the deck at approximately 930 pm, we witnessed two orange/white strobing orbs appear to the south of our position in Kitty Hawk.  The first appeared and remained stationary for about 10 minutes.  It strobed orange to white and at some times looked red.  It eventually move at a slight angle becoming very dim, until it disappeared.   Shortly after, the second orb with the same coloration appeared in the same area of the sky.  It drifted slightly from East to West, then remained stationary for about 8 minutes.  It then rose straight upwards.  As it rose a small white orb seemed to drop out of the orange orb.  The small white orb disappeared immediately and the orange orb faded until it was completely out of sight.   After about 10 minutes, a third orange orb came into view directly to the north of Kitty Hawk, lower on the horizon than the previous two, but strobing orange/ white.  It appeared to be moving towards our position, becoming increasingly more visible.  Then it began to fade until it was no longer visible.;36.0677;-75.7057
