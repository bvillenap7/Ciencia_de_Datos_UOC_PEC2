Viewing through binoculars, It was impossible to focus on The craft was visible over the ocean from the ocean shoreline at Kitty Hawk.  A bright light was reflecting off the ocean.  People approached us and asked if we saw the craft, we said yes.  We retrieved a pair of binoculars and tried to view the craft through the binoculars but couldnâ€™t focus.  It appeared to be flying in a small Haphazard pattern, but when you looked with the naked eye it appeared stationary.  We all watched it for about 15 minutes when 2 fighter jets from, I assume Seymour Johnson Air Force base, flew straight up towards the craft. The craft doubled its altitude in less than 1 second.  The jets reversed course and flew back, probably out of fuel.  We just stayed there in shock at what we were seeing.  One of the spectators called his mother in Greenville, NC, which is one hour inland, and she could see it!  We watched it for about another 15 minutes and it just stayed there. I have always wondered why it was never reported since the Air Force obv! iously saw it.  I reported this about 10 years ago to another website.;36.0677;-75.7057
