Strange bright light crosses road early one cold Winter morning;2017-02-20 02:30:00;1 minute;Strange bright light crosses road early one cold Winter morning Super bright blue light traversed across country road at approximately 60 feet above road. As I was driving, my vehicle completely shut off. Radio shut off, as well. The entire incident took less than 1 minute, but once the light entered the wood line to the right of the road, it disappeared, or instantly was no longer visible. The height of the trees in entered were approximately 65 feet and were dense in number. The light had no sound and wasn't flashing or sparkling. It was constant and extremely bright. As suddenly as it disappeared, my vehicle started up and the radio and headlights resumed. Nothing was reported in any local news and I am unaware of anyone else who witnessed this event.;35.8146631147545;-80.8942771857913
