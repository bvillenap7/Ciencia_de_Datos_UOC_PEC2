We were about mile marker 150 coming from Statesville to Winston-Salem. When out of the northern sky we saw a very large fireball with long tails of fire, headed towards the south,right in front of us.It was very bright red and blue with orange flames . We thought it was a Jumbo jet we had never seen anything like this. When I got home I called the police and they called to Yadkinville police and I told them what we had seen. Almost 2or3 weeks later another sighting of the same thing happened again in a town close by where we saw it, and it was on the news people saw the firball hovering over some trees and they thought a plane had crashed. But they never found anything!!!!!;35.8146631147545;-80.8942771857913

It was a steady light which seemed to get larger and brighter the longer we looked at it, but it did not flicker or pulse.  Then it seemed like it was turning then disappeared, as if it had been turned off.   The entire thing lasted about a minute.;35.8146631147545;-80.8942771857913
