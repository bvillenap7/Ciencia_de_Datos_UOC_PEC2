Brightly lit, triangular craft flying closely over my home.;2008-04-08 22:35:00;approximately 7 minutes;Brightly lit, triangular craft flying closely over my home. Around 9:35 PM I heard what sounded somewhat like a helicopter flying extremely close to my home, I thought it was strange for it to be so low in the air. Out of curiosity i ran to my window, opened the blinds and to my surprise i did not see a helicopter overhead but a brightly lit, isosceles triangular shaped craft floating at about a speed of  15 mph directly above me.  The craft was not completely a full triangle, the base was cut out resembling an arrow or a chevron. The lights were vividly bright colors of blue and red, racing at a moderate speed around the full perimeter of craft. Standing there in amazement, I called for my mother and my younger brother, by the time they reached my room the craft was only approximately 100 yards away. Together we watched it barely graze the tree line. I then got my camera and went outside, the craft returned several times. I have two recordings of the sighting one 45 seconds and the other 1 minute and 30 seconds. It was very quite, and moved as if it was literally floating. The object appeared to be round in the sky, my conclusion is because the lights race around it giving it the illusion of a disc. After about 7 minutes the craft vanished.;35.8146631147545;-80.8942771857913
