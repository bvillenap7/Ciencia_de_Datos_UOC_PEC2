I was outside on June 13, 2002 when i saw 4 strange lights. They were just hovering over my neighbors house. I dcided to go to the road so that I could see them more clearly. When I got up there I noticed that there wee 16 lights, all grouped in 4's. The groups were arranged in a diamond. All of the sudden the formation started to move. I heard no noise, an eerie silence. When 1 of them was right over me I noticed that the lights were part of a craft. The craft was diamond shaped and the bottom of the craft kept changing from yellow to blue, from blue to red, and from red back to yellow. I know aircraft and they dont have yellow bottomes that change color. Then the craft formation started to gain speed and when the other crafts became visible instead of lights, the formation sped away without looking back. This all took place in about 20 minutes.;35.8146631147545;-80.8942771857913
