Then it dimmed its light(s) and took off North... out of sight! Saw this while relaxing outside on my deck.   There was a full moon, and I was enjoying the light it reflected onto the landscape when I saw an orange/red light:  I thought it could be a planet or close star, as it was stationary for about 3 or 4 minutes... (It was over the trees, but I could not tell distance or size of the object.)  Then suddenly it dimmed its light(s) to about 25% illumination and began slowly to travel to my right (north), and then it accelerated quickly and - zoom! - it was out of sight... WOW!;35.8146631147545;-80.8942771857913
Tri-colored light in eastern sky attracts attention of star gazer near midnight in Statesville, North Carolina.;2005-09-03 23:35:00;30 mins;Tri-colored light in eastern sky attracts attention of star gazer near midnight in Statesville, North Carolina. At approx. 11:35 p.m., I stepped out to my front porch to smoke a cigarette. I'm always looking at the stars whenever they are visable. I spotted a star that looked to be blinking. I watched it for about 3-4 minutes before asking my husband to get his glasses and come outside. I pointed it out to him and he returned in to the house to retrieve his binoculars. I continued to watch the star. I could tell that there were at least three colors, white, red and green (or blue). When my husband returned with his binoculars, he said whatever it is, it sure is neat. He then gave the binoculars to me and I watched it for a short time. There seemed to be a goldish colored light that would appear occasionally. It hovered in the sky over what looked to be the Freightliner Truck Manufacturing Plant in Cleveland, NC. I checked two more times to see if the light was still in the sky. The first time, it had not moved, but the second time it had moved slightly higher and to the east.;35.8146631147545;-80.8942771857913
UFO Spotted In Statesville 9/01/13.;2013-09-01 22:35:00;3;UFO Spotted In Statesville 9/01/13. I was driving in Statesville North on Turnersburg Hwy.  I had just passed tractor supply when I noticed traffic was slowing down.  I looked around to see why, ie Was there an accident?  About 1/2 mile up the road in the air above the field between the Captains Galley Seafood Restaraunt and an abandoned old run down building, there was something in the air.   My windows were rolled down and I heard NO noise.   I had taken my dog for a ride to the local fast food for a treat.  My windows were rolled down and he was crying anticipating good, however when we got to the Fort Dobbs hardware store (which is where traffic started slowing down), he immediately became completely and totally silent.  There was just silence everywhere.   In the air were two giant gold balls with seemed to emit a very strong glow.  That was all I could see.  The balls were hovering about 30 feet in the air over the field.  The balls floated in the air in that exact position for ar! ound four minutes.   The balls then started to spin around in a circular pattern starting slow but rapidly becoming faster until they became a blur.   The craft then disappeared across the night sky traveling NE in a streaking, golden blur.   I KNOW I am not the only one who saw this.  I am positive it wasn't because of any tower or anything like that.  I even stuck my head out of my drivers side window to make sure what I was seeing was actually real.   I listed it as only one witness because of myself, but there were in fact at least 10 other people who saw this craft as traffic essentially came to a standstill.;35.8146631147545;-80.8942771857913
