Trangular object seen over interstate.. pictures to prove it!;2012-07-27 19:00:00;~2 minutes;Trangular object seen over interstate.. pictures to prove it! The craft was triangular and had many lights going along each side.  The lights themselves were very bright, if not brighter than ultra-violet lights with 6 to 8 lights on each side. The object was fairly close to the ground which surprised me.  It was about the size of a car and was hovering in a stationary position, not moving at all. It was seen just as the sun was going down over the horizon, so it was neither broad daylight nor complete darkness. My fiance and I seen the craft somewhere between the North Carolina and Tennessee border... it was in the Harmon Den Wildlife Management Area. We were traveling along 40 heading North/North West when we spotted it just above the interstate.;35.5631;-82.919
