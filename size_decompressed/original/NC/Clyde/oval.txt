It would move side to side, up and down and then disappear  for about 30 seconds then would show back up.   After doing this for 20 minutes or so it moved quickly above us.  You could see lights inside but no noise and then it sped off and was just gone. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter, It looked to be 1/10th the size of the moon.  It was oval in shape.  Not perfectly round though if that makes sense.  Because of its side to side movements and being stationary for minutes, I that it might be a helicopter.  I was in the Army and was Air-Assault, so I have sling loaded and have ridden in many helicopters, so I soon realized that's not what it was.   It was about 6000 feet in the air at first and it took off over our home and slowed to almost a full stop.  It was higher in elevation as it went above my home but you could see the outline.  It was kinda round and you could see a light around it coming from the inside.  Like a revolving lit restaurant looking from outside of it.  It actually started scaring me when I realized it had no sound coming from it.  It moved slow but then quickly.  Faster than a plane can fly.  The lights were a smoky white light coming from inside.  You could just see a hazy light at farther distance.  Clear when it was close.  There were no flashing lights on it.  I hope this helps as this was the first time seeing something like this.
