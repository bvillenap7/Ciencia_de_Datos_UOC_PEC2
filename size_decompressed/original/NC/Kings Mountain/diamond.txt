Diamond shaped object over Kings Mountain;2007-11-28 17:45:00;15 minutes;Diamond shaped object over Kings Mountain Traveling home from work, west on 74. Large bright object diamond shaped. Stayed stationary. Became brighter the closer I got. Noticed alternating flashing lights near the bottom of the shape. Positioned in western slightly Northwestern sky. Very, very bright. Vanished. Was not a plane. I almost pulled over on the side of the highway to view object because this was so strange. Before I could it was just gone.;35.2493999999999;-81.3811999999998
