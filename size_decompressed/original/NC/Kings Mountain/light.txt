Amber (Orange) Hummingbird-like UFO Sighted in Kings Mountain, NC;2011-08-12 05:30:00;One minute;Amber (Orange) Hummingbird-like UFO Sighted in Kings Mountain, NC I am a marketing copywriter for the business-to-business software industry.  I work out of my home in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina.  I am 51 years old. At 5:30 AM, I went outside to smoke a cigarette, and I eyeballed a large, amber light hovering in the sky above my home.  At first I thought it was a star or planet. Abruptly, the light started darting around.  I rubbed my eyes and shook my head, but the thing was still there, darting around like a hummingbird. It's odd, but I felt like the thing was winking at me.  I mean, it WAS winking.   Then, when I made a move, it made a move. I couldn't determine the object's altitude.  It looked like it was in the sky, but it was reacting to my moves, which makes me think it was pretty low altitude. I was kind of mesmerized by it.  I could see it rocking left and right, like a pendulum. It looked like a light bulb.  I mean, I could see the filaments, right. Then it rose straight up  and moved off to the south with a kind of zig-zag fishtail move.  Zip, it was gone.;35.2493999999999;-81.3811999999998
