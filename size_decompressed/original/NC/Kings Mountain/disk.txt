Half dome silver metallic object hovering in the sky;2020-10-14 15:00:00;20 seconds;Half dome silver metallic object hovering in the sky I was driving eastward down highway business 74 in Kings Mountain North Carolina. I observed a silver metallic object floating in the sky just above the tree line at around 3:00 pm 10/14/2020. The object looked like a half dome saucer, silver in color, and reflective on top with a flatter underside that was darker in color. The object from my viewpoint looked to be about half the size of a full moon in the sky. The object was suspended in the air roughly 30 to 40 feet above the tree line. As I began to go around a slight curve in the road, I lost sight of the object behind some tree limbs. When I rounded the curve the object was no longer visible.;35.2493999999999;-81.3811999999998
