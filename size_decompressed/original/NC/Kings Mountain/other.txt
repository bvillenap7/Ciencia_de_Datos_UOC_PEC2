UFO sighting on hwy 161 between 7pm and 7:30 pm EST. Bright orange oblong shaped aircraft. I was driving on Hwy 161 towards York , SC. I had just gotten off of exit 8 ( Kings Mountain , NC ). The sun was setting to the right of me. The sky was already dark to the left of me. Out of the corner of my eye , I noticed an oblong ( circular and oval shaped ) aircraft that originally appeared to be the moon. However , it instantly shot to the other side of the road and moved towards the setting sun at a snails pace. It had two becons ( on top and on the bottom ).  These becons flashed a red light , independently of each other. Had it not been for the contrasting skyline , this aircraft would not have been seen.  The aircraft resembled a blimp , however , it was totally illunated with an orange glow . The glow wasn't bright like the sun.  However , it was entirely orange ( like a sunset ) and this illumination stayed within the context of it's frame. It had no windows and no jet stream at anytime. Yet it moved in a blink of an eye when manuvered to do so. It! first appeared on the right hand side of the road and moved within an instant ( a matter of a second ) to the left hand side and continued to hover at about 10,000 feet about the ground. I came to an opening on the side of the road and noticed other vehicles pulled over and people observing the same thing as me. I pulled over and observed this craft moving towards the orange skyline and vanish. The first thing I thought was  Military . But the more I dwell on it...it could've been something else. However , I've been in the military and seen all types of things. This WAS NOT anything other than something entirely foreign to the best of my knowledge. It WAS a UFO. Albeit , alien or government. But something is most definately out there !! Later that night....my sense of smell would only smell supher or moth balls. The carried on through the remainder of the night. I write this on day 2. I wonder what will happen next as I hear that sometimes , people get sick from radiatio! n or something. I'll be back in touch.;35.2493999999999;-81.3811999999998
T-Shaped lighted craft travels North-South across sky at low altitude, makes very soft, hollow whistling noise, sky flashes.;2013-09-05 05:30:00;One minute;T-Shaped lighted craft travels North-South across sky at low altitude, makes very soft, hollow whistling noise, sky flashes I went out to smoke a cigarette at 5:25 AM on Friday, September 5, and immediately noticed a T shaped craft with 6 bright amber lights (three on each side describing a T shape) and two tiny white strobes (one on each arm of the T). Craft was flying low from North to South at about the speed of a commercial jet on final approach for landing.  There are no airports here.  I determined the altitude by following the sound the craft made, which was a soft, hollow whistling noise as it passed overhead.  Did not sound like any jet aircraft I've heard before it was very quiet. Sky flashed a dim green as craft passed overhead, like heat lightning.  Skies clear. No Port and Starboard running lights observed.   Sighting lasted approximately one minute, until craft receded behind treeline.;35.2493999999999;-81.3811999999998
