Three vertical rows of huge bright red lights observed in Emerald Isle, NC over the ocean under Mars in the sky.;2007-09-04 22:30:00;3 to 4 seconds;Three vertical rows of huge bright red lights observed in Emerald Isle, NC over the ocean under Mars in the sky. We vacationed in Emerald Isle, NC the week of 9/1/2007 - 9/8/2007.  Our oceanfront beach house had a great covered porch where we all spent the better part of our evenings.  The weather was beautiful all week and we were aware that there was a good chance to see meteor showers.  As we chatted, we were gazing at the stars much of the time looking skyward over the ocean. One evening mid-week, we saw a rectangular shape of three vertical rows with 3 or 4 lights in each row of bright red (slightly orange) lights.  The lights were huge and looked like they were located just under and slightly to the left of Mars in the sky.  They appeared out of nowhere, were stationary and blinked out after about 3 to 4 seconds. About an hour later, lower in the sky in the same direction were more red lights (3 or 4 lights more or less in a horizontal zig zag row) they also appeared and disappeared  within a few seconds.  These second set of lights reminded me of flares, but they did not move or stay lit like a flare would have.  I know Camp LeJeune is close by, but I do not know what those lights were.   It was a fascinating event. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));34.6691;-77.0287
