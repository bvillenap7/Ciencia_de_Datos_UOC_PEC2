Orb would levitate, then move slowly downward to horizon, then accelerate straight up at high rate of speed.  At one point the orb shot straight up, then straight down, then upwards again.  Through binoculars, I could see 5 individual bright lights inside the main orb.  This activity lasted at least 2 hrs, then orb accelerated upward and left.  Hover time (without moving) over the ocean would sometimes last 10 mins.  Movement aeemed to be in 90Â° trajectories.;34.6691;-77.0287
