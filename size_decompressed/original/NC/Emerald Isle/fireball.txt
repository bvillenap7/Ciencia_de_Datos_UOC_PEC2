Two orange fireballs seen moving in a southerly direction and climbing until no longer visible.;2013-08-10 22:20:00;5-10 minutes;two orange fireballs seen moving in a southerly direction and climbing until no longer visible. The object first was sighted low over the tree line to the north moving in a south southeast direction for a duration of about 5 minutes then slowly began to climb until it was no longer visible.  The total time this first object was visible was approximately 10 minutes.   About 10 minutes later, another object appeared at about the same altitude of the first object but just a little south of the first sighting.   The object took more of a direction south along the island and was also visible for about 10 minutes moving at what appeared to be a fixed altitude then began to climb until it was no longer visible.   After a period of about 5 minutes it appeared that the light was coming back into view but began to descend and change to a grayish color and the shape looked as if it were more oval shaped.  We lost sight of the object as it went below the tree line. The objects were viewed by a retired Marine Corp Lt. Colonel, a retied transportation specialist and his wife, a restaurant manager and his son.  And,still photos and a video were taken of the objects,;34.6691;-77.0287
