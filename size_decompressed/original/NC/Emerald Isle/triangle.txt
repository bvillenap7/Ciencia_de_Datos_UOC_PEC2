UFO over Emerald Isle, NC  7/22/2010;2010-07-22 22:00:00;5 min.;UFO over Emerald Isle, NC 7/22/2010 My Mother and two sister in laws were sitting on the back porch of the beach house we were renting for the week. It was a bright moon and some haze, but otherwise clear night.  At 10 pm they all said LOOK at the same time, Did you see that?  In the sky to the right of the moon was a triangular shaped object with lights.  Almost as soon as it appeared it 'shut off'.  They all looked at each other and said 'what was that'?  There were no helicopters, ships, planes in the area. No noise at all. They all studied the sky after wards and about five minutes later another 'object' appeared to the left of the moon, closer to the horizon, this one was saucer shaped. It had a row of bright lights red gold and green. It was as if someone had turned on a light and then turned it off, and it was gone.  They all saw it again and shouted Look  There! at the same time.  Many others joined them on the porch afterwards but nothing else appeared in the sky that night.  We do not know what it was, did anyone else see this?;34.6691;-77.0287
