4 red/amber lights seen 4 times in 45 minutes- no sound, circular shape- clear night.;2010-07-22 21:30:00;45 minutes;4 red/amber lights seen 4 times in 45 minutes- no sound, circular shape- clear night. Sitting out on the deck overlooking the ocean in the 6800 block of Ocean Drive on Emerald Isle.  Almost full moon and clear night- little clouds in the sky.  Looked up with my daughter and asked her if she saw the lights and she agreed- we saw 3 red/amber lights in a row, no sound coming from them, maybe a flicker, but not blinking- then one by one they went out- in a row.  About 10 minutes later I  saw them in about the same position in the sky and they appeared to come on one by one and then go out one by one- a total of 3 lights.  Again, no sound, no continued blinking like a helicopter or a plane would make- silent.  I called my family outside- 4 more adults and 6 more kids.  In about 10 minutes we again saw the row of red/amber lights- 4 lights this time come on in silence and then go out- my dad said well that was a circular shape.  Everyone started screaming and was very excited.  10 minutes later we saw it for the final time a little bit further no! rth or to our left.  Caught it on  video film this time- same amber lights- no blinking, just on and then off, one at a time.  Everyone agreed it was not an aircraft, flare or fireworks- no smoke, no sound, no falling flames- just the lights in the sky.  Stayed outside for another 30 minutes and didn't see them any more.  Will have to submit video when we get home and I have time to download it.;34.6691;-77.0287

Red and orange circular objects disappearing and reappearing.;2013-09-11 20:30:00;50 minutes;Red and orange circular objects disappearing and reappearing. Witnessed appearing and disappearing red circular shapes about 20-30 degrees in the distant horizon.  The red shape would disappear and then another would reappear at what seemed to be the same general area but a different location.  At one point the red object disappeared and reappeared in a row of 3.  This activity lasted for approximately 15 minutes then began again in about 20 minutes.  The second portion of activity included a very bright stationary orange circular object which then appeared to split into 2 objects and disappeared.  This activity lasted only for about 10 minutes but in a slightly different region of the sky.  The red circular objects were still active during this second portion.  No sound, trail or smoke present.;34.6691;-77.0287
