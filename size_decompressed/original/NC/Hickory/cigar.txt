Large cigar shaped craft floating over Hickory.;2012-01-06 07:30:00;15 minutes;Large cigar shaped craft floating over Hickory. I have been a truck driver in the area for 15 years. I recently had two very good sightings of UFOs.  The first one was near exit 128 on I-40 me and my girlfriend witnessed a large cigar shaped hovering over or near I-40 it turned slowly went at about a 45 degree angle and slowly ascended.  it was very large 2-3 times the size of a plane.  The sky was clear and we also saw planes with contrails but the cigar had no contrail and moved very slowly it was much lower also i would say about 5000 feet.  The next week on 01/13/2012 about 10 miles south of Taylorsville on Hwy 16 heading south saw a bright reflection in the sky like a mirror that caught my attention it was about 1000 feet above the treeline the object was hovering and then began to turn slowly or rotate.  It was metallic and round but not a disc more like a sub shape.  Then it took off south faster than anything i have ever seen south towards Charlotte it was gone in the blink of an eye.  I have seen multiple reports from my area and i wanted to add what i have seen.;35.6959520798673;-81.3606804076529
