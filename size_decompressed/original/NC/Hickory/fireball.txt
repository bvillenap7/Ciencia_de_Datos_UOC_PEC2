Fireball seen in  Western NC;2004-06-05 00:05:00;10 seconds;Fireball seen in  Western NC I was leaving work at just after midnight. Was head south, approaching I-40, and just happened to glance up at the full moon. Just to the left of it, was what I can only describe as a fireball, headed SSE at an incredible rate of speed. It was about 1/10 the size of the full moon. I stared at it while driving for almost 10 seconds, and lost it in the lights of a mall parking lot as I passed. I looked in the local paper websites to see if anyone reported anything, but haven't seen any info on it.;35.6959520798673;-81.3606804076529
