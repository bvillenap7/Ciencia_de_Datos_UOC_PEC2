Orange Glowing and Pulsing Circular Object over Hickory, NC.;2018-12-17 21:00:00;1 minute;Orange Glowing and Pulsing Circular Object over Hickory, NC, USA I observed a round pulsing object that was bright orange and glowing.  It left no trail nor emitted sound.  I first noticed the object in clear skies at 9 pm at night facing West/North West at 295 degrees.  The object was slowly traveling straight down followed by a leveling off curve to the left then level horizontal for a distance.  During the leveling off curve and horizontal movement, the object slowed dramatically and at one point was almost no longer moving.  The pulsing orange light may have been caused by a rotation of the object.  The edges were fuzzy and the shape seemed to change with the pulsing.  I did not have a camera at the time and I went inside to get me wife to see it. When we returned, it was no longer visible. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and found him to be both eloquent, and sober-minded, about his sighting.  We suspect that he is a highly qualified witness.
