Red orbs over lake-no sound-spark falls from one to another;2011-12-25 22:00:00;2 minutes;Red orbs over lake-no sound-spark falls from one to another On Christmas night a group of us were having a small get together down by the lake. 5-10 minutes after my arrival one of my friends said &quothey look at that red orb in the sky...I myself live on the lake near our current location and am used to seeing red lights from helicopters and passing planes going to our local airport and I figured that's all it was...but as I said that's probably what it is a couple more red orbs appeared behind the first...at this time my friends and AI were all watching these orbs fly closer and closer with no sound, NO SOUND.  As they got closer there were 2 orbs trailing behind the rest but 1 seemed to be over top of the other and then all of a sudden a white flash that looked like a spark dropped out of the top orb towards the bottom orb and disappeared when it touched the other orb...these orbs floated at a slow speed almost directly over top of us and there was completely  NO SOUND...we were all in a state of shock after the spark fell from one to the next...Total Believer;35.6959520798673;-81.3606804076529
