Large triangle shaped craft traveling west on Hwy 70, Hickory, NC, at almost midnight.  ((NUFORC Note:  Highly reliable witness.  PD));1978-08-15 23:30:00;<5 minutes;Large triangle shaped craft traveling west on highway 70, Hickory, NC, at almost midnight. The craft was first seen over an incline, near a patch of woods on what is now Highway 70 in Hickory, NC, going west.  It was low to the ground when it came out, from behind the wood patch, and went over and across the highway with two big round white lights shining.   I remarked to my husband, That is the weirdest airplane lights I have ever seen.   The craft was headed west as we were going east, and it was on the left side, above and parallel to the highway.  The distance between us and the craft was close to 600yds at first encounter, as well as approximately 400-1000ft above the ground.  Its altitude was not easily determined because of its size and the darkness.   Then the third light on the craft came on in the rear side and that is when the triangle shape was revealed.  There was no sound coming from the craft and the shape of this massive triangle craft blocked out a lot of the stars above the highway.  The size must have been around the size as a large airliner. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of this report is well known to us, and she was married to a now deceased very skilled and dedicated UFO investigator in the Carolinas.  We consider he to be exceptionally reliable.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.6959520798673;-81.3606804076529
Orange lights forming triangle, disappeared quickly.;2012-08-04 22:05:00;2 minutes;Orange lights forming triangle, disappeared quickly. After visiting my grandmother on Saturday, August 4th, 2012, my mother and I were on the drive home from her house. It was a little after 10pm. I vaguely noticed a light in the sky, I payed no attention to it at first thinking it was an airplane. My mother then pointed to an opossum that was crossing the street. We watched it scurry to the sidewalk for a moment, that's when I looked back at the sky and realized that the light I had just seen was hovering in one spot, very unlike any airplane I'd ever seen. A split second later I realized I was looking at several hovering orange glowing lights, 5 in total if I can remember correctly, together forming a triangle/boomerang shape. My mind went immediately to the Arizona ufo/lights sightings a few years ago. I had seen a program about it on TV. I said &quotmom, is that a UFO!?&quot My mind hadn't fully comprehended what I was looking at just yet. We stopped at a stop sign and gawked for a few seconds, which felt like minutes. I kept saying &quotI bet it's military. That can't be what I think it is.&quot I then began to feel very creeped out. I told my mother to keep driving. She just said she didn't want to stop looking at it. I begged her to keep driving. So she finally did. We turned right and I saw that there was a lot of lightning in the distance in the opposite direction of the lights. I don't know if this is pertinent information but I saw lightning and never heard any thunder. As we resumed driving, I looked back at the lights again and there were only three left. It then appeared that the three remaining lights were moving directions. And suddenly I could see no more of the lights. They were gone. This all seemed to happen in less than 5 minutes. Ever since Saturday I have been looking on UFO report sights to see if anyone else had seen what we had. When I saw a report here from someone else in our area that had witnessed the same thing on the same night, I just knew I had to submit a report of my own. So glad we weren't the only ones to see this! I'm pretty sure my dad thought we were crazy until we showed him the other report.;35.6959520798673;-81.3606804076529
(3) Yellowish/Orange spheres in the shape of a triangle.;2014-01-01 20:30:00;1 minute;(3) Yellowish/Orange spheres in the shape of a triangle. I saw three orange/yellowish spheres moving from West to Northwest at a 45 degree angle.  They were moving slow, and in a triangle pattern together. Formation:  The first sphere was @ 3:00 o’clock, the next two behind were @ 12:00 & 6:00 o’clock. At first I thought it was three helicopters, but there was no sound or other lights flashing that typical aircraft have. I could not tell the altitude.  The three spheres moved slowly across the night sky until they went out of sight.;35.6959520798673;-81.3606804076529
