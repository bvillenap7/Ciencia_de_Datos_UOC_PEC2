UFO on the ground, next to power pole, observing traffic on Route 40, Hickory, NC.;2015-11-19 10:00:00;3 seconds;UFO on the ground, next to power pole, observing traffic on Route 40, Hickory, NC. There was a geodesic shaped UFO on the ground right off route 40 outside of Hickory, NC, USA, underneath a high voltage power line and close to the highway.   The object was blending into the clearing but was not completely hidden.  The object had clean lines running alongside and looked tooled in a sophisticated way suggesting intelligent design.   I estimate it was seven feet tall and maybe 4 feet wide.   Other people must have seen it too and did not know what to make of it.   It was extremely unusual.;35.6959520798673;-81.3606804076529
V-shaped object with 6 white lights and 1 red light at the point;2015-11-20 22:50:00;5 minutes;V shaped object with 6 white lights and 1 red light at the point I was on my way home from work and I noticed what I thought was a helicopter hovering in the distance.  But when I got closer to where it was I noticed it was a v shaped object that had 6 white lights (3 each one two sides) and one red light at the point. When I got to the stop light it took off with a zudden burst of speed and was out of sight in no time.;35.6959520798673;-81.3606804076529
