Black object hubbering in the clouds...;2009-02-10 16:00:00;normal;Black object hubbering in the clouds... When I looked up into the clouds I noticed there was a,looked like black dot hubbering in the cloud. It just sitting still. I called for my mother and my oldest child. After a few seconds,it moved around slowly,going straight. Then we noticed there was wings where there was none before. It was noticed immediatley.After the wings had formed it shot off like a light,towards the west. Then came back for roughly 15-20 min. It was oddly looking,black in color. My daughter said that when it moved it made a swivel look to itself. The clouds that day was big popcorn like clouds,real nice like a early spring day.( 68degrees);35.6959520798673;-81.3606804076529
