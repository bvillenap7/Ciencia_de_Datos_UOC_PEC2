Blue-Green Flash in the North Carolina Sky;2008-08-23 21:20:00;2 sec;Blue-Green Flash in the North Carolina Sky My wife and I were driving on I-40 Eastbound between Hickory and Statesville about 9:20pm on Saturday evening, August 23rd, 2008 when we observed a very bright blue-green flash that lit up an entire cloud near the Eastern horizon and lasted approximately 2 seconds. There was only the one flash. The cloud was a fairly large one, appearing to cover approximately 1/10 of our front windshield's field of view. The aqua colored light lit the cloud uniformly. (No brighter spot/spots within the cloud) I did not see a streak in the sky like a meteorite, and there were no thunderstorms in the area, but it did appear to light the cloud from the inside and did not impact the other clouds in the sky.;35.6959520798673;-81.3606804076529
