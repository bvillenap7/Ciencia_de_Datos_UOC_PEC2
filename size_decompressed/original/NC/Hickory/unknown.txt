The chrome dot never moved from its position.;2008-02-28 12:00:00;30 min;The chrome dot never moved from its position. Time is 12 pm lunch time. Sitting eatting. I noticed a chrome color dot about the size of a pencil eraser. Was blue skys one or two small clouds.  So it had to be 7 to 10 miles out and way up.  I watched it for 20 mins thinking it was flying to me or away or to the side of me but it never moved.  I know when looking at something like this for a long period of time your eyes twitch. It seemed that was happen or it would like brighten up over the time I watched it. 12:23 it just vanished (poof gone). I looked to one side then slowly to the other and spotted a big jet right where I was watching this object. You could see the vapor trail of this jet which pasted right in front of where I was focused on this thing. I watched the jet go by till out of site.  When I looked to see, that this oject was right there again but more where I could just barely make it out. 12:31 when back to work.  Could this have been a ufo?.

Mulitcolored flashing object seen near lake Hickory, NC.;2012-09-01 23:00:00;40 minutes;Mulitcolored flashing object seen near lake Hickory, NC. At 11:00pm my wife went to smoke on the back porch. She noticed the strange flashing object in the sky.  My wife called for me to come see it.  I went to the back porch and saw the object as well. Neither of us could make a definite shape of what it was but both of us noticed that it was somewhat stationary. There were flashing lights, Red, Green,  Blue, and white.  An airplane flew between myself and the object. It is possible to have seen it as well. My wife and I both watched it for about 10 minutes and then it disappeared.   We assumed that it was because of clouds so we kept watching.  A few minutes passed (approx. 5 min) and I noticed it again. This time it was about an inch to the right from where we first saw it. We watched it for little while longer until it disappeared again (approx. 10 min). I kept watching for it to reappear but my wife went on to bed. I then saw it reappear about 10 minutes later. This time it seemed to be further away and lower to the! horizon approximately Â½ inch above a small set of trees. I kept watching until it disappeared again. I kept watch for about 30 minutes and it never reappeared.;35.6959520798673;-81.3606804076529
