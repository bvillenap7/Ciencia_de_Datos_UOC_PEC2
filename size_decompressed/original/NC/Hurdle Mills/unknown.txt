Missing time during return trip home from picking up pizza.;2017-02-10 19:15:00;30 minutes;Missing time during return trip home from picking up pizza. Hello,  I wanted to share something that happened to me on February 10th, 2017, at around 7:15PM EST.   On Friday around 6:30PM I left my house to go pickup a pizza we had ordered for dinner.  I made the trip there with nothing abnormal, began the trip home and seem to have lost some time.   After making a left turn onto NC RT49 in Roxboro, NC, heading back to my home about 9 miles away, I remember seeing a section of the road where after the left turn, the road has 4 lanes.  About a mile or two after that the road narrows to 2 lanes and its around another 8 miles to my house.  I moved here about 3 years ago, so I am usually looking around at landmarks, way points, or familiar sights to keep me aware of where I am.   During this trip home I remember the part where the road changes to two lanes, but have no memory of what I saw during the trip home until I looked up, saw lights in the sky above me, and realized I had driven passed the road my house in on, and driven another 8 miles or so.  I onl! y remember seeing the lights above the road, and had to sort of hunch down in the seat to see them above the road.   At that point, I realized where I was, looked at the clock and it was 7:28PM.  I thought maybe I had fallen asleep, but the road has some curves-twists that could not be navigated without some sort of intelligent control.  I have no idea what happened, but thought I needed to tell someone about it.  Thanks, Scott Horner;36.255;-79.0827
