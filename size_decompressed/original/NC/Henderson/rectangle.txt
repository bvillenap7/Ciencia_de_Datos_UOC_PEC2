I had a newborn son and my husband was with him at my home in Henderson NC.I was driving up Creedmore Rd or Highway, and I put my brakes on at the top of the hill because I saw an object that I thought was a soapbox, like a soapbox derby. The moon was full that night, and I wondered why there were kids out on the street at 11pm. After I slowed down, I looked at this object, and it started to take off at an incredible speed down the hill. It was going at a fast speed, but it always maintained a low altitude, almost flying on the ground. I started to accelerate my car speed, until I looked at my spedometer, and realized that I was going 85 to 90 miles and hour trying to catch up with this object. The object left the highway, and I pulled over on the road and I was very shaken. If I were to drive that road again, I probably would remember the white house on the road that seemed to be a farm. The object was parked in front of that house. I got to my home that night, and told my  husband what I had seen that night. He laughed at me,and even when I drew him a picture, he didn't believe me. I am 55 years old now, and soon will be 56. If you were to give me sodium amytal, I would garantee you that I could create the same image that was given to me those many years ago.
