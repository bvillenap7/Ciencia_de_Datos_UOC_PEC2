My son called me outside at around 9:30 p.m to witness what he was seeing.  We saw 3 crafts in formation sort of like a long almost straight line but the one in the middle was up in formation just a little above the other 2 crafts.  They all had red, yellow, green and white flasing lights - all flashing at the same time and when I first saw it the way it was in the sky looked as if the lights aluminated the objects and it looked as if a silver line was connecting them.  It was the odest thing I have ever seen.  No airplanes fly in exact distance of formation like that.  We ran back through the foyer into the den and out the back door in seconds to see it from the back yard and it was nowhere to be seen in the sky. There were other airplanes in the area that did not look like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.3536117870723;-78.3961330798478
