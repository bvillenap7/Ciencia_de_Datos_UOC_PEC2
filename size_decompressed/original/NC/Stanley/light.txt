I live in the middle of 30 acres where there are no lights with a good view of the sky.  I just went out to check on my dogs.  I looked up into the north west sky and saw a bright light.   The size of the light was if you took a normal star and blew it up 10 times and magnified its light by a hundred.  There were no flashing lights.  I would estimate the hight of the object at about 50 to 60,000 feet based on the hight if the highest jet in the sky.  This light made the jets in the sky pale in comparison.  I watched the object for a minute or two.  It began to move slowly across the sky a short distance.  Then it left straight up into outer space and the light faded as it went.  It was gone in less than 5 seconds.;35.3451000000001;-81.0949999999998
