During the summer of 1974, two of my cousins came to my home upset and frightened, saying their car had just been buzzed by a large object with bright lights. They were afraid to drive the rest of the way home alone, so I followed them in my car. When we reached their home and looked to the east, we saw three objects hovering above a field behind our grandmother's home.  They were in a triangle formation, with two on top and one on the bottom. We sat on my cousin's porch and watched them for a few hours. During that time, every so often they would swap positions, reversing the triangle. They had mainly white lights, but those changed periodically to orange.  When I left, one of them broke away and stayed parallel to my car the entire length of the road (about a mile). I turned right, and it did the same. It remained beside me, just above the trees, until I met a car a half a mile later. Then it did a 180-degree turn and followed that car.  My cousins said the other two left in the same direction I drove a few minutes after my departure. We never saw them again, but there were other reported sightings in our area that summer.
