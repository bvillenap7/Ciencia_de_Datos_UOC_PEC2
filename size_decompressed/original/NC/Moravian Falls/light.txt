Bright white light over Moravian Falls changes to yellow-green as it falls;2010-03-10 02:40:00;5 seconds;Bright white light over Moravian Falls changes to yellow-green as it falls I was driving home northbound on Hwy. 16 from work en route to the Brocktown area of Moravian Falls.  At about 2:40 a.m., I saw a strange light that fell from the sky and disappeared into the treeline on the right side of the highway some distance ahead of me.  The light was bright white at first and then, as it neared the trees, turned to a bright yellow-green color, then disappeared. I could not pinpoint where the light disappeared, but it seemed to be in the area between Brocktown Road and Meadows Road to the east of Hwy.16.  Thinking the object might have been a meteorite, and therefore hot enough to spark a woods fire, I drove out part of Brocktown Road and all of Meadows Road in an attempt find the landing spot.  However, I did not find any sign of the light, nor did I see any smoke or flame.  An email to the local AM radio disc jockey (who mentioned the sighting to listeners that morning) received no responses, the DJ told me.;36.0767;-81.174
