Large green comet-like streak in the sky lasted 5 or 6 seconds.;2016-12-21 21:30:00;5 seconds;Large green comet-like streak in the sky, lasted 5 or 6 seconds. I was driving last night on a dark portion of the the highway, some trees on either side of the highway but the sky above me was uncovered.  The sky was mostly clear, you could see the stars clearly. In front of me I thought I saw a shooting star, so I looked up, but it was closer and larger than any comet or shooting star Iâ€™ve seen and lasted for a while.  There was a bright green round core, and a silver/green trail of light behind it, like a comet would have, but much larger and closer.  It lasted for about 4-6 seconds, was traveling very fast, and then disappeared quickly before it reached the horizon.;36.0774000000001;-79.0879999999998
