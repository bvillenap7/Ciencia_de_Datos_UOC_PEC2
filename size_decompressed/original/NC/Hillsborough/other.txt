I was watering my tomatoes when I heard what sounded like a small plane in a dive. I kept expecting to see a small plane come into view over the trees any minute as the sound was getting closer and closer. To my suprise, a plane with two sets of wings came into view. It had a long slender body that appeared to attach to the large set of triangle shaped wings that made up the back end of the aircraft. These wings which actually looked like one big assembley were cut off straight on the outermost angle and were straight across the back end. I could see that they were thick at the back end .They appeared to me to be at least 2to3 feet thick with what looked like two engines in the very center of the rear of the wing assembley. These engines were not mounted on the wing assembly but a part of it. I never saw an intake. The short stubby wings were a short distance from the front end of the fuselage. This was a long very large aircraft. It looked almost like a flying wing with a fuselage stuck on it and a short set of wings on the other end of said fuselage. the plane was a silver color with the large wings appearing to be a darker color of silver. The engines made a whining noise not your common jet noise. They sounded like a small plane in a dive as heard from the ground. I thought that it was going to start to rain any minute, the clouds were black and hanging low.I expected to hear thunder at any moment. This plane came crusing over below the cloud cover and I saw it good for at least one minute,then the trees broke my line of sight. I tried to look this up on the web but the closet thing I could find was an artists rendering of the so called Brilliant Buzzard which wings and engines do not match what I observed. I was very impressed with what I observed. Who knows, I may see it again if they are flying in this area .;36.0774000000001;-79.0879999999998
Orange UFO exploded by something.;2010-10-20 20:00:00;1 minute;Orange UFO exploded by something I was delivering a pizza, heading northeast towards the Durham area. On St. Mary's road for anyone who knows Orange County. Being bored, I was watching what seemed to me to be a plane, though it looked weird.  It was large, and perfectly still and had no strobe.  It had a rectangular red light, a circular white light in the center, and then a rectangular blue light.  It was clearly very, very far away and higher up than the second craft. Suddenly, as I was watching, a small orange sphere that appeared to be on fire moved very quickly above the tree line and into my field of vision.  The circular, central white light on the first craft flashed, or flickered (very clearly, though), and the orange sphere exploded. This all happened very quickly and I was driving the entire time.  I observed the first craft - what I think was a plane of some sort - until I had to turn.;36.0774000000001;-79.0879999999998
Star Wars UFO.;2017-01-26 22:35:00;5 minutes;Star Wars UFO. Resembled small Star Wars jet, light in color with green, red & white lights almost completely silent, going relatively fast curving a sharp right past vision.  Low flying, too small to carry more than two people.  Appeared out of nowhere, from the east.;36.0774000000001;-79.0879999999998
Flying very slowly in the S sky near the Aquarius constellation were a total of 4 large red lights in an L formation.;2017-10-24 20:45:00;2 minutes;Flying very slowly in the S sky near the Aquarius constellation were a total of 4 large red lights in an L formation. Flying very slowly in the Southern sky near the Aquarius constellation were a total of 4 large red lights in an L formation. 3 vertical with 1 to the side.  It appeared to be very, very large and to be one craft that blocked the stars behind it.  It flew very slow, silently and the lights blinked in no particular order randomly and without pattern.  The round lights were very large.  Suddenly a white light, like a vertical beam appeared below the single red light that was off to the side and the entire craft slowly dropped below the tree line and was gone.;36.0774000000001;-79.0879999999998
