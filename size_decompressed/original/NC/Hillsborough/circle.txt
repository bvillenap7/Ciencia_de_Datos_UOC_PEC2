I reported this event to the local authorities and asked them to call me back because I have never seen or reported anything like this before. The lights lasted for 3 minutes and suddenly disappeared. They made no noise or blink, they just all disappeared at once. I asked the authorities to check air traffic with navigation towers. Thereâ€™s multiple airports in the area. The lights never blinked or changed colors they just disappeared all at the same time. I also asked them to ask the tracking stations if there were any transponder signals. Please let me know if you find out anything about this event.;36.0774000000001;-79.0879999999998
