((HOAX??))  Glowing fluorescent white with flashing bright colored ribs on the outside.;2014-06-10 22:30:00;1 minute;Glowing fluorescent white with flashing bright colored ribs on the outside It glided over my house at the treetops. It was dark And I was in the yard with the dogs.  I expect it was 200 feet up in the air.  It appeared to be glass and glowing fluorescent white from the inside.  It had ribs with flashing colored lights along the connections in the glass panels. It had no wings.  It had a circular disk around the back section. It made no smoke trail, but it did make a high pitched whirling roar.   Just glided on past and over the next ridge. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the report is an attempt to hoax us.
