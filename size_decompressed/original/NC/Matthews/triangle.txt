Pyramid formation lights above Matthews, NC.;2016-01-01 00:05:00;3-5 minutes;Pyramid formation lights above Matthews, NC. Just after midnight, I went out into my backyard to have a cigarette and I saw 3 lights in the sky, forming a sideways triangle or pyramid.  At the front were two lights, nearly vertical and then about 300ft behind them, a single light, forming the point but at the rear.  The three lights moved in unison, and at the same speeds.  The lights were white with a bluish halo. I immediately called my wife and 8 year old daughter out and they both witnessed the event.  I tried to capture it on my cellphone but was unable to get anything clear. Once the lights disappeared behind my neighbors roof, we lost track of it.;35.1087523224047;-80.7051362021866
