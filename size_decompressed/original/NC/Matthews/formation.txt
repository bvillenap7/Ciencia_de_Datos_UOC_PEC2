Hovering line of lights in formation.;2014-07-16 21:00:00;5 minutes;Hovering line of lights in formation. At 9:10PM on July 16th of 2014, a son, his mother, and fiancé sat down to eat a quiet dinner in their suburban home.  Approximately five minutes later, his fiancé heard a faint sound and asked what it was.  They muted the TV and everyone stopped in their tracks.  The two family dogs had their ears perked up and  started growling.  He went outside and not a moment sooner he came rushing in frantically telling them to come outside. 	It was reaching dusk and as they went outside in the middle of the street they looked in the sky and instantly brought out their phones to capture a once in a lifetime moment.  In the sky, six to eight lights were blinking randomly in a straight line over their street.  The lights never moved, staying over the small suburban neighborhood hovering.  His mother was quick to point out that whatever was in the sky had blocked the clouds near it.  A few seconds later a small airplane was taking flight and was headed in their direction. 	The plane went under the unidentifiable flying object missing it.  At around 9:25PM the object had flown west and never seen after that.  The family stayed outside after to try and see if it would come back and to further study the formations of the stars.  Three bright stars were in the formation of a large triangle, but later became unidentifiable because of neighboring stars during the night.   Whatever it was never came back, but it sure was one scary yet exciting experience.;35.1087523224047;-80.7051362021866
50+ orbs in a pattern low flight.  Police took image from phone.  I have pictures.;2014-11-02 19:00:00;5-10 minutes;50+ orbs in a pattern low flight.  Police took image from phone.  I have pictures. My neighbor knocked on our door in a frantic when she went to take her dogs out. QUICKLY, COME SEE THESE LIGHTS!   Me and my wife scrambled out the front door to see the lights fly in a pattern.  triangle followed by three in a straight line followed by a triangle repeating. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This is the picture of the UFO we saw.  My neighbor is the one who alerted us that there was lights in the sky when she was outside walking her dog.  She knocked on our door saying “Hurry! Come see the lights!” me and my fiancée rushed out to see about 50+ orange balls in a formation coming from the Fort Mill/Rock Hill direction of SC.  We are close to the border so we can see the objects moving from that direction. Article of a Fort Mill man who caught a object on video and had burn patterns in his grass the same time we saw the objects. http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/11/02/5285017/rock-hill-man-reports-ufo-other.html Here is the attached picture of what I took.  When I took the picture the flash went off on my IPhone.  I switched to camera mode to take video and my phone rebooted.  I also felt nausea that night, after seeing the objects. Any more questions, feel free to contact me.   Thanks. ((END ADDENDUM));35.1087523224047;-80.7051362021866
Large number of objects with red lights flying in formation over Matthews, NC making no sound;2014-11-02 19:30:00;5-10 minutes;large number of objects with red lights flying in formation over Matthews, NC making no sound My brother and I were standing in a hospital parking lot talking, and I noticed a bunch of reddish-orange lights coming over the treetops and rising up into the sky.  I asked him what it was and he said he had no idea.   A nurse walked up and started watching them also. she had no idea what they were either.   I started counting and got 35, but there were more before I started counting.   Once they got up in the sky overhead they appeared to line up in a type of formation of 3's. What was so strange is they made no noise at all.  Once they passed over us they completely disappeared or turned off the lights.   My brother thought they must be some type of stealth military aircraft.  I did not see anything on the news that night so I just brushed it off until today when I read a post on this site from some other people in the area that saw the same thing.  I am a retired dispatcher, my brother is a businessman and the third witness was a nurse.;35.1087523224047;-80.7051362021866
