I looked up into the sky and saw a pink/red glowing saucer shaped object.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-30 09:29:00;5 seconds;Stepped outside on the front porch with a friend and on a whim I looked up into the sky and saw a pink/red glowing saucer shaped object fly in a straight line from east to west rather quickly.  No way this was an aircraft or strobe light or anything like that.  Object flew in a way I have never seen by any authorized aircraft before.  Also, object was very vibrant in color.
