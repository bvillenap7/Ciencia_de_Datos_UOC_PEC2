Flaming Fireball sitting in the sky immoble over a house!;2002-09-08 21:00:00;as long as i could see it;Flaming Fireball sitting in the sky immoble over a house! I was driving by a house that was all lit up by lights in the middle of a huge field, probably wheat or cotton, late at night about , roughly, 9 o'clock eastern standard time. I saw something about the house so i looked and about 100 feet about, maybe, was what loked like a pole or long cylindrical object that looked to be on fire or coved in a plasma. the red-orange fire swept to one side but moved extremely slow, not like a lighter that flickers but really really slow. It sat, immoble over the house and did not change in possitions one little bit. The sky was completely dark but could see some stars.;35.1087523224047;-80.7051362021866
