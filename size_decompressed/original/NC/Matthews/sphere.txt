It then moved vertically and stopped.   It then moved 90 degrees south again and stopped.  We all agreed that this is totally bizarre as the light didn't blink and remained solid red the whole time.   Someone mentioned that it is probably a drone, but I have no idea how to determine if any drones were in the air at that time.   The light would have been over Indian Trail or maybe further west/south.;35.1087523224047;-80.7051362021866
