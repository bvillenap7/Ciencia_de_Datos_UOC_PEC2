We were standing on the front porch last night shortly befor 9:30 pm.  The sky lit up with what appeared to be lightning, maybe two seconds later it lit up again but it was an orange color, then almost instantly a big flash of turquoise.  We stood there in disbelief and curiosity of what we just saw & waiting to see if the sky lit up anymore but it didn't.  There was no noise of any kind following any three of flashes/lightsâ€¦.  We're not sure what it was, but it definetly wasn't lightning. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.1682999999998;-80.3781999999994

One bright white light in the front, followed by two red lights horizontally opposed quite a distance from the front.   The craft was almost silent...I could not tell if I was hearing it or another craft off in the distance.  It appeared to be very low when first sighted, but higher just before it disappeared.  My friend and I were on my driveway behind my house and it was dark.;36.1682999999998;-80.3781999999994
