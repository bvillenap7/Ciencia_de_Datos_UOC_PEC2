Shiny saucer/disk sighted over Como, NC.;2016-06-05 10:00:00;5 minutes;Shiny Saucer Disk sighted over Como, NC Traveling Hwy. 258 in Como, NC, on way to church.   Suddenly, appeared in my path of sight a very shiny object.   I drove to a point where I could safely stop and got out of the car to get a better view.  I saw an object moving to the right from where I first saw it ascending sideways to an undetermined height, and it appeared to stand still for a brief moment.   That is when I saw a path or a trail approx. 2 ft. wide and 10 to 12 ft. long, with orange and green radiant colors extending from the top of the object.   It, at this point, began to go to the left, climbing higher as it went, and eventually, out of my sight.  I was able to take a picture. I am a Pastor.;36.5054;-77.0108
