I did the same with almost the exactly same time and weather conditions today.  I have now obtained digital photographs of same thype of objects taken today 01/10/01 one photograph even shows northeasterly commercial jet traffic to verify size (small) of objects and direction of travel.  If this is some natural phenomenon I would like it explained.  I will have to get my daughter to download and send as soon as possible.  I do not know how to down load these pictures.  Thank goodness for computor generation kids.   In the picture  contanning the commercial jet there was no  interference between the object and the jet and the object appeared to be much higher than the jet.  (estimated @ 30,000') This occurance has been very questioning to me.   I have over 4,000 hrs as a private pilot and I have never witnessed anything of this nature.   Peter contact me if you have any further queswtions.;36.0331;-79.3804999999996
