I assumed it was a normal aircraft until I noticed its unusual flight patterns and lack of sound.   The light began bouncing (I can think of no other word to describe the movement) up and down at first, and then left to right.  This continued for around 20 minutes, until the light seemed to dissipate.;36.0331;-79.3804999999996

We've been watching it for 10 minutes so far.  The light appears to be dancing up and down, left and right.  The night sky out here is very dark we are at least 5 miles from town.  It's hard to see, but there appears to be a black triangular shape around the light.  Again, this is difficult to completely discern because the night sky is so black. This is not the first time we've seen the dancing yellow light.  We've seen it on at least 2 occasions before, always between the hours of 1:30 and 4:00 am.  The first sighting was in January 2016.  This sighting will be the third in 3 months. The light has now been there for about half an hour.  There's no sound and the general position has not changed.;36.0331;-79.3804999999996
