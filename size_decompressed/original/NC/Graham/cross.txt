White semi-cross shaped object in daytime speed was slower than a plane.  It gave me plenty of time to watch it until it became cloud covered.   It flew higher than the hawks that frequent our view line but was definitely not as high as a plane.  Then shortly after, my son, my husband and I were watching at the same time, when a dark oval shaped object followed in the same line as the white object, at the same height and speed.;36.0331;-79.3804999999996
