Large Triangular Object near Charlotte.;2010-03-07 19:00:00;2 minutes;Large Triangular Object near Charlotte. We were sitting on the backporch after dinner.  Off to the south I see 3 red lights moving across the sky.  They form a triangle and flash in sequence.  At this point it is close enough to appear to be one craft, but if so is the size of a town.  It banks to the east and slowly heads away.  Speed wise it was moving about half of what the commercial jets in the area  appeared to be.  When I pointed it out to my friend his first statement was the same as mine what in the hell is that.   We quickly called the rest of our family from inside to come out.  No one had a clue what it could be.  I am still very curious. Hopefully someone else in the area saw something.
