Me and my Sgt. saw 2 large green circles with purple in the middle flying over town.  It was incredibly fast we saw it briefly but then lost it in the trees.;36.3544;-78.1602

There were no lights in the center making it look hollow inside.  It did not move.   Then it just disappeared after I watched it for at least 10 minutes. Was seen about 1/2 mile south of Warrenton, NC, where no street lights or house lights were present.;36.3544;-78.1602
