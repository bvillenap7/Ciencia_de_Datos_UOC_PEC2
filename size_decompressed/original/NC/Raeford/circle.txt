Circular silver aircraft without smoke trail dissapeared after 10-15 seconds;2019-12-01 14:50:00;10 seconds;Circular silver aircraft without smoke trail dissapeared after 10-15 seconds As I was waiting to leave a retail chain parking lot, I was sitting at a stop sign when I looked up to see something catch my eye. I t was almost as if someone had a mirror, reflecting it towards me from the sky, but when I focused on it I seen it was a circular looking, silver aircraft without a smoke trail.  It reflected twice at me and when I hung the phone up to take a picture, it was gone.  The weird part was after it reflected a second time, I felt the urge to turn my head and not look, but not because it was too bright, more like I felt I wasn't supposed to be looking at what I was seeing.;34.9879000000001;-79.2168999999998
