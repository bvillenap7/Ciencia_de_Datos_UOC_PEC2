Three identical white shapes far off in sky - one disappears instantly;2010-02-18 18:00:00;1 minute;Three identical white shapes far off in sky - one disappears instantly My sighting occurred in my car on my way home from work at approximately 6:00 p.m.  Coming to the crest of a hill, with a long stretch of road in front of me, I had a perfect view of the early evening sky.  The setting sun was at the horizon line and the sky was a wondrous mix of warm orange and clear blue.  It was the beauty of the sky that caught my attention, causing me to look up.  In front of me, high in the sky and far in the distance, I saw three distinct, separate, yet identical shapes.  From my perspective, they could best be described as lines.  Three short, separate, white lines in the sky, completely motionless, neither moving nor growing.  As I stared for a moment, trying to decipher what they were, one of them vanished in the blink of an eye, while the other two remained.  Literally, in one moment there were three and then in an instant, there were two.;34.9879000000001;-79.2168999999998
