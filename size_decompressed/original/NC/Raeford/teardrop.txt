Pinkish/Orange oval shaped object seen over Raefod North Carolina.;2004-09-09 19:30:00;10-15 seconds;Pinkish/Orange oval shaped object seen over Raefod North Carolina. I was sitting outside with my wife, when I happened to look up in the sky and saw a pinkish/orange oval shape, about 20 to 25 thousand feet high, I assume.  It had no other colors other than pinkish/orange mixed.  I watched the object for about 10 to 12 seconds while it moved at a high rate of speed that i have seen from other known flying aircraft.  it was about 1/8 of an inch long from where i was sitting to the altitude where it was traveling.  it was going south west to north east from raeford to the direction of fayetteville.  not to sure if it was an object burning in from space or something else.  it had a constant speed and a constant direction the whole time.;34.9879000000001;-79.2168999999998
