Strange cloud trail in the sky.;2014-02-21 17:00:00;20 minutes;Strange cloud trail in the sky Was at the park eating dinner.   When my son and I heard what sounded like gunshots being fired.  And a few minutes later my son says to me, look at that formation in the sky.  What is that? it wasn't a typical cloud formation like you see from a plane.  It was straight across, with two vertical lines set close together coming downward.  It was to big to be a kids rocket or school project.  It lasted for about 20 minutes or so then vanished.;35.3115122137406;-81.5585580152673
