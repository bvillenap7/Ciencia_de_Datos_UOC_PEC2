A bright light that turned into 2 lights and shot off in two separate directions.;1978-07-08 00:30:00;5 mins;A bright light that turned into 2 lights and shot off in two separate directions. I know it's a little late to report this but I felt it needed to be done.  While visting my father (exact date estimated), upon leaving, I noticed a bright light in the sky above the field across the street.  I called my dad outside on the front porch to verify what I was seeing in the sky.   After a couple of minutes the bright light separated into 2 lights suspended in the sky.  After a minute or so both lights shot off into different directions.  My dad and i looked at each other in confused amazement then I left, never to mention this until now.  This was witnessed shortly after midnight in Shelby,NC, in 1978. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.3115122137406;-81.5585580152673

One orange star like in appearance was at the three o’clock position and the other was at the six o’clock position neat the star Sirius.  I was looking at Orion’s belt and other early appearing stars and noticed that the object at three o’clock was moving to the south slowly. It moved as small distance and the six o’clock started following.  They both moved south for a few seconds and became very bright white and them zipped at extreme speed south and was gone!  These two objects were stationary for at least fifteen minutes before they moved.  I was thinking about getting out my 16 inch telescope but decided not too because of the clouds moving in all around.  I have always been a skeptic about UFO sightings but now I am no longer.;35.3115122137406;-81.5585580152673

Very bright star like figure, near an airplane that was possibly Abducted but this star like fugure;2019-12-04 16:57:00;~1 minute;Very bright star like figure, near an airplane that was possibly Abducted but this star like fugure So, I am younger than you can say an adult, but I was in my moms car, and I was staring at the sky, then I glance to the left, and a light appears, it was very faint at first, then after a period of around 10 seconds it got brighter and brighter,  Then I screamed to my brother, and said, Do you see that light?! and I pointed to it, and he saw it. After a period of around 8 seconds, it just sat there, then all of the sudden a second object appears,  But I don't think it was a UFO, it looked somewhat like a plane. It had wings like an airplane, But there was something strange, they weren't moving. and they were in the sky at around 135 degrees South West, and all of the sudden, the second object, which was the one that looked like an airplane, faded away to the direction of the first object and this took around 5 seconds, but which felt very slow, and after these seconds, the 2nd object disappeared and after around 10 seconds, the first object, faded away at the same speed as it got bright.  I would describe the first object as being like a star, like the north star, circular, but I couldn't see the object clearly because of how bright it was, the light was the same as a star, but it couldn't be a star because how early it was and my street is kind of light polluted, so you can't see stars until relatively late at night. I had Always been fascinated by strange things, such as the paranormal.  But I always had this fear of when you read or watch something, or imagine it, it would become real. This terrifies me, because i've never thought they'd be real but they are.  And I know I am not lying, and i'm still terrified from this event.  I don't care if you don't believe it's real, but I know it in my heart an mind that I saw this, and something I will never forget. Now I know that we are not alone, and no one can take this knowledge away from my heart, such a terrifying sight it was.  At second thought, I think That airplane may have been abducted, but I am not sure.  I think this may have been a reason for the flights that have disappeared over years. Well that will put an end to description and explanation. If you read this, please note that I am not trying to waste your time, and I seriously believe in what I saw.  Thank you for your time.;35.3115122137406;-81.5585580152673
