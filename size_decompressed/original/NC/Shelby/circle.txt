It was my birthday party and me and my friends were walking around the block about     21:30. I just happened to look up and I saw a circular object with  white and bright blue lights all over the bottom of it. It hovered in place for about 8 seconds then shot off faster than anything I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
