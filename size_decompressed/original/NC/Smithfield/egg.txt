Eggshaped ufo spotted near plane;2008-07-01 15:00:00;seconds;Eggshaped ufo spotted near plane I was riding home with my family.  It was a clear day, very bright.  I happened to glance of to the left and I saw a single engine plane, a small one.  Off in the background behind that, I got a glimpse of a grayish-white eggshaped object that appeared to be floating in the sky.  I only got a glimpse before trees blocked my view, but it was no plane, no balloon, no blimp. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
