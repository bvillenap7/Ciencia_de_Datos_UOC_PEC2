I noticed 3 red lights flying low in the sky and in a straight formation moving across the night sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-15 20:25:00;3 minutes;On Tuesday, Nov 15, at 8:25 pm, my husband and I were delivering a car to a auto sale place near 70 hwy 4 lane when I noticed 3 red lights flying low in the sky and in a straight formation moving across the night sky.  The lights were not blinking and they  look to be about maybe 30 feet between each other, Really to close . we were real close to 70 hwy 4 lane and the lights were close enough that we should have hear some noise if the were planes or jets but the hwy was busy so if there had been any noise from the air crafts the big trucks and cars  may have drowned it out. I asked my husband did he see those lights crossing the night sky ,he said he thought they were three small planes  but he was busy unloading the car off the roll back he had not really looked at the lights till they were further away from us ,I told him planes don't fly in a straight line and that close to each other without moving some ,these lights did not move like small planes would ,he th! en said its Jets , but the lights were moving across the sky really slow and low and Jets move fast cause we have seen Jets flying at night and their lights blink,the lights were moving from North to South ,there is a  airport for small planes and lear jets in Smithfield NC on business 70hwy ,but these lights were further down from where the airport is moving toward Raleigh.Not sure if they were planes or not but can't rule that out.just strange the way they were flying so low and with no blinking lights.
