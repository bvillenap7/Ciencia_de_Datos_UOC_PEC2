I SAW 2 DISK SHAPED OBJECTS OUTSIDE MY WINDOW.;2002-10-13 19:00:00;35 MINUTES;I SAW 2 DISK SHAPED OBJECTS OUTSIDE MY WINDOW. WELL I WENT TO MY ROOM TO RELAX AND AT 7:00PM I HAD SAW SOME LIGHTS OUT SIDE AND I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS THE STREET LIGHTS.  SO I IGNORED IT AND AT 7:28PM IT WAS STILL OUT THERE SO I WENT TO GO AND SEE WHAT IT WAS. AND WHEN I WENT TO THE WINDOW THERE WERE 2 DISK SHAPED OBJECTS HOVERING OUTSIDE MY WINDOW.  I SAW LIGHTS CIRCLING AROUND THE DISK SHAPED OBJECT THE LIGHTS WERE GREEN, YELLOW, WHITE, RED, AND PINK.  THEY STAYED THERE FOR ABOUT 3 TO 5 MINUTES AND THEN THEY SLOWLY WENT TO THE LEFT. AND I WENT TO MY OTHER WINDOW AND I COULD STILL SEE THEM GOING DOWN THE STREET.  I WAS IN SHOCK I COULDN'T MOVE OR SCREAM FOR ANYONE.  IT WAS VERY CALM OUTSIDE THERE WAS NO WIND BLOWING NOTHING WENT OFF AND I DIDN'T HEAR ANY NOISES.  IT WAS SO QUIET I COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ELSE.   I WAS FIXED ON THE DISKED SHAPED OBJECTS.  I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT SAW THEM.  I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM AT THE TIME.  I ONLY SAW THEM FOR 3-5 MINUTES BUT THEY WERE THERE FOR 30. ((NUFORC Note:  No other witnesses indicated.
