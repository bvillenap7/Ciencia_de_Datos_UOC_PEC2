Very large craft with a bright light in front of it seen near Smithfield , NC;2016-03-16 15:33:00;15 minutes;Very Large craft with a bright light in front of it seen near Smithfield , NC On Tuesday night around 9:33 pm my husband and I heard a very loud noise outside our home.  We went out to see what it was , we looked south in the sky from where the sound had come from and saw a Very Large Craft gliding in the air just above our house, making no noise at all, it looked kinda like a plane  but made no plane noises, it was a dark gray flat color, and had wings but shorter than a plane does,  the ends of the wings were turned up a lot higher than any plane we have ever seen.I work at a near by hospital and my husband is a auto paint and body man ,we live near an air force base so we have seen a lot of different planes over the years but nothing like this at all. The very large craft had a bright white light in the front of it moving from side to side ,the bright white light did not look as though it was part of the very large craft. There was only a red light on the bottom of the craft but no other lights and it was not flashing,all the planes we have seen around here have flashing lights on them ,  we watched the very large craft as it  glided over us without any noise at all, there were cars going on the road in front of our house, but they did not seem to notice the very large craft up in the sky just above them, they just kelp going .   we stood and watched as it moved through the sky going north west till it was out of sight and then we just looked at each other and said what do we do now . I went in and called my mother and asked her what to do, she is writing this for us cause we did not know where to go or what to do or who to tell.  she has also seen unexplained  thing in the sky as well.;35.5092000000002;-78.3495999999997
