I was driving and the light caught my eye I thought it was a falling star at first because it was moving very quickly at a downward angle but it lasted longer than a shooting star and did not have a tail. It was an obvious light with no tail or aura and was larger than a shooting star. It was large round and neon lime green.  I slowed and watched it until it split into two separate lights one shooting up and one shooting down and then both lights disappeared.  I found some other reports of people who saw the same thing at the same time as well as seeing the same description the morning before in the area.
