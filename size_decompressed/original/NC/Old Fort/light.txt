2 low flying red lights flashing in call and response dancing through the sky in Western North Carolina.;2015-02-11 22:30:00;5 minutes;2 low flying red lights flashing in call and response dancing through the sky in Western North Carolina. I went out on the porch and was looking at the stars which were especially beautiful this night. I saw a red light flashing just behind some trees across the road. I thought it was a tower at first, but then I noticed a second red flashing light. I walked into the yard to get a better view and saw that they were moving just above the tree line.  They moved to my left and they were flashing in a perfect call and response pattern. They moved fluidly and appeared to be separate objects.  Their distance was not constant. They continued around to the left and over the hill until I could not see them.  I came inside and searched for similar sightings and found one report that described two lights dancing in the sky.  This description fits what I saw. It was quite beautiful. I came out 5 minutes later and saw them near the mountains west of here, where they soon were out of sight.  I saw an airplane plane fly overhead soon after they disappeared.  I do not know if that is related. One other thing is that while I was watching them when they were within appx. 100 yards from me, I heard a crash in the house, which scared the death out of me.  I ran in and my microphone  had tipped over and landed on the ground.  I don't know if ufos knock over microphones, but if they do, I find that very rude.   I am 33 years old and this is my first sighting.  It was very exciting, but I'm also a little shaken because they were so close to the house.;35.6169;-82.1686
