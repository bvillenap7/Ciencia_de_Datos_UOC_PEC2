I am sharing available information and two pictures that were presented to my by a very dear friend that passed away a little more than a year ago.  I had encouraged him to share his sighting at that time, but he was reluctant to do so.  I will attempt to relay his comments as accurately as I can recall them:   At noon on 1/28/12, myself and two of my friends were sitting outside of the patio of the Raffaldini Vineyards enjoying a glass of their wine.  It was sunny and beautiful so I decided to take some pictures facing northwest toward the mountains.  The sun was to my back so I don't think what I caught on my camera was related to lens flare.   At any rate I took two pictures with my iphone about 30 seconds or so apart and noticed lighted objects were captured in the two pictures when I viewed them upon my return home.  Neither myself or my friends saw these objects with the naked eye at the time the pictures were taken.  The attached photos provide all l of the specifics of the pictures.   My friend had a nice combination of skepticism and open-mindedness and he felt as though he had caught something very unusual in his pictures that were visible to the camera for some reason, but not to the eye.;36.2086;-80.9245
