This just happened less than 30 minutes ago. I was studying for exams and took a break to smoke a cigarette.  While I was on my porch that overlooks the ocean I saw out of the corner of my eye one light that flashed maybe two or three times but very dimly.  When I looked in that direction 4 lights slowly increased in brightness and took off south in a straight line very fast.  I’m not exactly sure how far away they were but seemed like a couple miles. Maybe over Masonboro Island which is I think 3 or 4 miles away.  I don’t think it was one craft because three of them were in a triangle but not a perfect one and the other was off to the right.  They were close to each other though, but it’s hard to say how close because they were far away.;34.2204;-77.7953
