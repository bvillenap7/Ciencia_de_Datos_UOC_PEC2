Glowing disk with single beam sighted at Wrightsville Beach 9/19/09 at 7:50p.m.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 19:50:00;10 seconds;Glowing disk with single beam sighted at Wrightsville Beach 9/19/09 at 7:50p.m. My friend and I were sitting on Harbor Island looking out on Banks Channel and Wrightsville Beach.  It is a cloudless night tonight and night had just fallen.  My back was turned, but my friend abruptly brought my attention to the sky behind me.  She had just noticed something in the northern sky.  It was a glowing golden disk fairly far up in the horizon with a white beam extending down from it a fair ways.   The disk appeared to rise up a bit before it faded swiftly faded from sight.  It could not have been an airplane, satellite, or jet weâ€™ve never seen anything like it in our lives. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));34.2204;-77.7953
11/17/09 a disc w/ flashing lights hovered off coast of NC for 1hr+ moving horizontally then climbing off at a steep angle.;2009-11-17 03:00:00;1.25 hours;11/17/09 a disc w/ flashing lights hovered off coast of NC for 1hr+ moving horizontally then climbing off at a steep angle. While observing the meteor shower on November 17, 2009, we noticed an object North-northeast from Wrightsville Beach, N.C., hovering over the Atlantic Ocean.  Multi-colored flashing lights, including orange, yellow, red, blue, and purple changed around perimeter causing what appeared to be a spinning effect.  It occasionally moved horizontally but primarily maintained a fixed position approximately 20 degrees above the horizon.  As the meteor shower dissipated, a civilian or military aircraft flew past the object which then slowly moved away at a steep angle allowing the disc shape to be seen more clearly.  It could be seen with the naked eye and, in more detail, through Tasco Offshore 21  7x50mm binoculars.   This was witnessed by a 50 year old professional person and spouse along with a high school sophmore and two college students.;34.2204;-77.7953
