About 10:55 pm Friday Dec. 6th my roomate and I were outside our house at Wrightsville Beach, NC. We saw a bright light blue ball light up and drop down towards the west. It was almost blinding and only lasted a few seconds. We were on a second story porch, facing the south and it was in the sky at about a 45 degree angle in the sky.;34.2204;-77.7953
