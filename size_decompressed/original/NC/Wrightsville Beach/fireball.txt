trange lights off of Topsail Beach;2006-08-15 22:00:00;2 hours;trange lights off of Topsail Beach My family and I were all on my Uncle's back porch at his rental home on the water front.We were waiting the moon to rise at 11:50 and we started noticing these really bright fireball looking shapes off the coast off of Topsail Beach across the inlet.They would come and go, sometimes as many as three at a time would appear.They would appear and look as if they had gone under the water.Sometimes when the lights would go out you could still see something there for a few seconds then it too would dissapear. Please if anyone else has seen these lights please post on here as well. I have seen that a couple back on 07/29/04 saw a similar sight off of Ocean Isle beach about 45 minutes south of here.;34.2204;-77.7953
A fireball-like object was seen falling for two minutes until it made a sharp 90 degree left turn and exited the field of vision.;2019-09-22 19:15:00;10 minutes;A fireball-like object was seen falling for two minutes until it made a sharp 90 degree left turn and exited the field of vision. One family member saw something falling from the third floor. The sky was completely clear and the sun had recently set.  Five people went to the third-floor deck to witness this object, which we assumed to be a meteor due to its round appearance and the trail it left.  However, it remained in the sky for almost 10 minutes at dusk, while there was still light in the sky. For the first two minutes, we witnessed the object falling directly downwards at a slow pace.  It then made a sharp 90 degree turn and continued to move in that direction, leaving an orange trail.  It left our field of vision after 10 minutes of continuing to the left. We are still unsure as to if this was some sort of space debris, such as a meteorite, falling through the atmosphere but it does not seem to match the criteria.  The object was far enough away that we did not think it would hit anywhere near us.;34.2204;-77.7953
