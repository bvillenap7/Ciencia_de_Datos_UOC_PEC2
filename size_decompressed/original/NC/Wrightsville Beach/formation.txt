3-4 objects moving around eachother about 45 degrees over Wrightsville beach (Venus??);2004-08-01 03:30:00;1.5 hours plus;3-4 objects moving around eachother about 45 degrees over Wrightsville beach 3 Objects, about 45 degrees over horizon, sometimes a 4th object joins them (note: I am having a friend enter this into his computer as I am watching and talking to him on my digital phone) Dancing lights in basically a triangle pattern. They move and pulse dimming and/or moving to and away from me. one was white, one bluish-white which is the smallest shifted to red at times, one bright yellow (the largest) shifting to soft yellow-white and fades to more blue but the full moon affects its color changes as if it is reflecting moonlight. This one has a specific shape to it like a 5 pointed star. A 4th one shows up every now and then appears like a tiny red dot that darts forward and away. The triangle pattern seems to rotate around itself mainly clockwise. At 4:50 am they are in more of a line pattern one nearly 90 degrees overhead. For reference, there are thunderheads overhead and rain sprinkles the whole time. The formation of them changes and rotates and has been going on the whole hour and a half at this point. These are bright enough to often show through the thunderheads. At 4:58 am back around 60 degrees up, no longer straight above me. Lights are still here but I am heading back since I am starting to get really rained on. Objects still darting and shifting brightness. Objects seem to be unaffected by the weather and possibly checking out the beach and maybe even noticing me. I am a Christian and having trouble explaining what I am looking at. Are there any aircraft or man made objects that can do these things? ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were looking at Venus.  PD));34.2204;-77.7953
