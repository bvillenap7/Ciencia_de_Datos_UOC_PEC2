It was exam time and a few days before Christmas break.  The dorm was full, but the halls quiet, because most of us were either studying or trying to catch up on sleep.  It was about 8:30 pm in the evening and I had just lay down and turned out the light to catch a nap. Suddenly the brilliant light flashed into my room with a thunderous sound.  The whole room shook.  Frightened, I ran out of my room.  Girls every where in the hall where screaming did you hear that, what happened?  No alarm went off, but about 10 girls at the large window at the end of the hall, yelled for us to come and see what was in the sky.  It was a typical winter night sky, I don't remember a moon, but I do remember thousands of beautiful stars.  We looked in astonishment as large star like object hovered distantly in the sky.  It danced like a Mitch Mitchell music ball all over the horizon.  Suddenly it lifted itself high above the distant mountain peaks and 5 smaller orbs separated from the large one and just went crazy in the sky zigzagging everywhere.  Then all six orbs flashed into the sky and disappeared.  We called security and they said we were just seeing things, that we, a whole dorm-floor of girls were just playing a hoax.  It was no hoax.  I really heard that large boom in my room and looked out that window with the other girls and it was no jet plane.  It was beautiful dancing orbs, and I am as sane as rain.
