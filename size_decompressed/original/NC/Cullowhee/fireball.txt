The sky lit up.  I observed a HUGE blue glowing ball coming in to my left.  We live on road with many curves.  Therefore, my best guess is that the fireball entered the atmosphere from the WNW.  The object tracked like a meteror but I've never seen anything this large.  It was trailing smoke and started breaking up and just before we lost sight the object glowed orange. Honestly, it was so huge that I gripped the wheel of the Jeep and told my wife to brace herself for the concussion of the impact.  Nothing came. Afterwards, we observed military aircraft in the area circling.  The contrail of the object that came into the atmosphere remained for a while after. There is absolutely NO DOUBT that military aircraft were in the area both before and after the event.;35.2373;-83.1462
