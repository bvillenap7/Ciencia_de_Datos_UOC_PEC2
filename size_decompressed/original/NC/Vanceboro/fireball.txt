large yellow fireball with long green tail;2003-10-20 20:45:00;10 to 15 seconds;large yellow fireball with long green tail My friend and I were taking his mother home, driving across a field in a 4 wheel drive vehicle when we saw a giant round fiery yellow mass with a large green tail fall from the sky, down toward the earth, behind the trees in the woods west of us. I had never seen something as large as this or with such a long trailing bright green tail. It may have been falling longer than 10 or 15 seconds, we only viewed it as it appeared through the windshield. It was incredibly beautiful!;35.3049;-77.1761
