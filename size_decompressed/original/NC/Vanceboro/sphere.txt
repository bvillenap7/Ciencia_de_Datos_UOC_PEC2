Strange light in the sky over Eastern NC;2004-03-23 20:30:00;5 minutes;Strange light in the sky over Eastern NC My husband and I were driving from New Bern to Vanceboro, in a northwesterly direction.  I am a retired healthcare professional, and he is a supervisor at the local Naval Aviation Depot, and is very proficient at identifying both commercial, private, and military aircraft.  He was unable to identify this object. It was a very large bright yellow/amber spherical light, appearing to remain stationary southeast of us, and fairly low in the sky.  It did not appear to pulsate.  It was too large to be a conventional aircraft, or a star.  About 2 minutes into the sighting, a smaller sphere of the same color appeared to drop out of the bottom of the larger sphere, and then it stopped moving, and after another 10 seconds or so, it just winked out.  The larger object remained visible in the same location until trees blocked our view.  The weather was clear at the time of the sighting, with excellent visibility.;35.3049;-77.1761
