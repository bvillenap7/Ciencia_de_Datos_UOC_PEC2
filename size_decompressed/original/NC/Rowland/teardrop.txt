It was party cloudy sky tonight.  Coming home right below the moon a green neon light appeared behind the dark clouds.  Shot straight across the sky from left to right faster than anything I've ever seen before.  I didn't say anything hoping my wife had seen the same thing and she did.  She was like What was THAT!  The size, color, and speed of the object is what amazed us.  I've never been a beleiver in UFO's and have experienced a metor shower before.  This was nothing like the meteors I saw entering the atmosphere.  This UFO paused for a second behind the cloud lit up and shot across the sky like lightning. WOW! Were're still in shock.;34.5853;-79.2595
