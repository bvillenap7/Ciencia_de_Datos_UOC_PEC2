Orange lights traveling N to S;2013-06-13 00:00:00;~10 minutes;Orange lights traveling N to S Was about midnight, was sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette when I was observing the night sky.  We had a major storm blow thru the region earlier that day, which caused power outage, so I was able to look at the night sky and see the stars. There was no cloud cover, and dont recall the moon being out at the time. I was looking in a northernly direction when I viewed these 2 orange colored lights traveling together in a straight line.  What struck me as odd was they stayed in a perfect 'formation', one never led or fell behind the other, it was if they were 'attached' and moving across the sky at a pretty fast rate of speed.   They seemed to be at a high altitude, as I watched them, I viewed a lower flying conventional aircraft traveling SE to NW, intersecting the lights' flight path below them. I watched the lights travel across the viewable sky for about 10 minutes until I lost sight of them behind trees in the south.;35.3563000000001;-80.2047999999998

A blip suddenly streaked up by the moon and then past it.  I noted it and discussed it in a video I then took of the moon.    Did not give it too much thought until I found out I had gotten it captured on still photo I had taken.  I took a series of still and videos of the moon last night, May 3, 2015,   I have posted my pics and vid on several places on FB on my page and on some friends' pages.;35.3563000000001;-80.2047999999998
