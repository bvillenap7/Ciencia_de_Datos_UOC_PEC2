Faint chevron-shaped object over Albemarle, NC.;2008-03-01 23:00:00;five seconds;Faint chevron-shaped object over Albemarle, NC. I was in my backyard, and looking up towards the southeast, not quite overhead, I saw a bow or boomerang-shaped object, around 9 inches from tip to tip visual size, moving in the direction of the front bow or angle.  My impression was that it was three to 10 feet from tip to tip, 20-50 feet above the ground, moving silently at a steady speed of about 10 mph in a straight line. It was very faint, barely visible, perhaps even transparent. There were no details I could make out. I saw it for about three to five seconds, until I lost sight of it.  I am not at all certain that this was not an owl or other nocturnal bird, or even a trick of the eyes. I will admit that a few months or so later I saw what I am sure was an owl, and noticing the resemblence concluded that that must have been what I witnessed previously. Upon seeing a very similar phenomena on 09-13-2009 however, I rethought the experience and decided I could not be sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
