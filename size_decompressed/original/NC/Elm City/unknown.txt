This probably isn’t anything but it was certainly odd to me.  I was on my cell phone on my back deck and was watching a small plane take off over the tree line from the Rocky Mount-Wilson Airport.   A brighter light caught my attention and I looked straight up to see what I thought at first was a star but it got brighter to the point that it looked  as if I was seeing the bottom of a rocket or missile as it fired. It appeared stationary and further up than the airplanes in the sky.  I could not see any strobe lights or any other flashing lights that airplanes usually have. The object appeared to travel straight away from me up and became very dim in the period of about 3 seconds and then became dim and traveled in a southern direction until it disappeared about 2 seconds later.  Again, this probably isn’t anything but I stargaze frequently and have never seen anything like this.;35.8133;-77.8553
Unidentifiable objects in the sky;2015-11-06 23:30:00;Temperance Hall Rd.;Unidentifiable objects in the sky I was driving and notices a red fire looking beam bouncing off the trees and pulled over because I could not figure out what it was!  Then I noticed another same looking object! My friend stared video taping and i zoomed in to take pictures on my camera it shows 2 red looking things and 1 blue looking object!  One of the objects looked like a saucer!  Very interesting and happy I was not alone or everyone else would have thought I was crazy!   Then all of a sudden they disappeared!;35.8133;-77.8553
