It disappeared behind a gathering of trees to my right. I had left the local library at 8:00 p.m. and was traveling home along a rural road. I was heading south when I saw a blu-green ball of light with a long yellow-orange tail come from the sky and fall behind some trees to my right. I am not a good judge of distance, but it was close enough for me to see that it was not a star. It did remind me of the light from a large roman candle, however, this light came from the sky, and not the ground When I returned home, I mentioned this incident to my husband who shrugged it off as a meteor, however, the fact that it was blue made no sense to me. That evening I got chills down my spine when I heard Peter Davenport come on the Art Bell show and share that this ball of light was seen from Florida to North Carolina. I am a 33 year old stay-at-home mom who has never seen any resemblance of a UFO ever! However, what I saw was certainly something I could not identify.;34.5446;-77.9402
