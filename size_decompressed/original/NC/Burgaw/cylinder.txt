Long uniformly shaped cylinder overhead at low altitude, minimal sound and changed direction easily;2011-01-10 19:30:00;6 minutes;long uniformly shaped cylinder overhead at low altitude, minimal sound and changed direction easily 1-10-12 approx. 7:30 pm  neighbor was leaving my home and we saw lights coming over my huge pine tree. Sound was minimal and object was long with light at each end. Moved slow and made very little noise. Passed overhead in the dark sky, I could see the shape of a long cylinder, my neighbor was further in the yard and she said it looked like a long rectangle….it was the same shape from end to end with no contouring.   We watched it pass over expecting it to keep on going but it turned to the right 3 o’clock, made a u-turn like it was going to pass back overhead but continued to turn and headed back on original path, still with very little noise like you would expect from a jet at that low an altitude.  Within 10 minutes, a friend approximately 15 miles away told me to look at the lines in the sky, they were in the pattern the object had flown.;34.5446;-77.9402
