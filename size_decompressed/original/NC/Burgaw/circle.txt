I am a psychic who runs a group called Eastern Paranormal.  We as many others do use Ghostboxes and many spirits come through claiming to be inner dimensional beings, on the moon,..........The maker ((name deleted)) says aliens channeled him info on how to build the first box. Anyway, last summer I took a box out was in my pool playing with husband and goofing off chatting away with them.  Many lie, some are truthful, you have to use discernment with them, that's why in our YouTube video's we put we neither endorse nor refute we just present their evidence.  Anyway a HUGE ORANGE ball lit up my back yard.  It was like a plasma ball and you could see them in it.  It was REALLY SCARY.  They came through the box.   We calmly walked into the house and I didn't use the box again for months.  I have also since been followed home by two from Jacksonville, NC (32 miles from my house)but they were not the plasma balls they were light like crafts.   Anyway I will put you some links to smaller ones pics.  They are here all you have to do is look and tune in.  Rather that is a good thing or a bad thing is complicated but I cannot fathom you folks really don't know about them since people have been reporting these big orange paranormal balls forever.
