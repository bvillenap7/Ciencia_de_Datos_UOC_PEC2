They culminated into bright orange flashing lights once. On the coast of Holden Beach, North Carolina. Initial sighting of white, hovering, flashing lights at 9:30 PM EST. About 4 flashing lights remained in a rectangular formation for a few minutes before moving in unpredictable yet coordinated directions. An hour later(&#877610:30 PM) the lights reappeared, but culminated into more coordinated and sporadic movement. The lights converged into a line before becoming bright orange shortly before returning to normal. At about 11:20 PM, the flashing lights returned to move around the sky in bizarre directions. The white flashing lights appeared often in the sky over a span of a couple hours, but the lights turning orange and moving as coordinated as they did only happened once. Whatever UFO activity it may have been was extended over the period of a few hours and only transformed in bright orange lights for a fraction of the whole experience. This phenomenon was witnessed by me, as well as several members of my fami! ly.;34.026;-78.2893
