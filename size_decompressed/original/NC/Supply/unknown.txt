My friend and I were removing deer from my fathers farm that were destroying crops on that summer night. The area is very rural all of the surrounding land was owned by International paper company (logging). We spotted the craft above us as we slowly drove down the road with our lights off it was moving on a flight path that followed the road  it seemed. It was approximately 200 feet off of the ground moving VERY slowly and silently. It had two light beams that were shining in all directions in a sweeping motion. One light source on each side of the front or cockpit area of the craft. The beams swiveled and moved much like a chameleons eyes do in their sockets. The lights were searching the ground at times and out into the air around the craft at times. The craft banked very slowly toward the north (it was traveling east) tilting at an extreme angle while continuing to search with the lights. It went out of view for a few moments then returned to the same area.On the second period of observation the craft gained altitude steadily then shot off towards the southwest without a sound.The whole scene lasted around 18 minutes, with a total of 10 minutes of actually observing the craft. Some type of military craft on training from seymour johnson or camp lejune ? Or extra terrestrial ?;34.026;-78.2893
