Strange light similar to meteorite suddenly turns in perpendicular direction.  Seen again moving across sky and moving up.;2014-01-18 18:15:00;3 seconds (twice);Strange light similar to meteorite suddenly turns in perpendicular direction.  Seen again moving across sky and moving up. Saw large bright light in the sky this evening around 6:15pm, sort of pale blue-green with red behind or around outside.  Thought it was a falling meteorite and pointed so family could also see.  Just before it disappeared behind trees and houses in the distance it made a fast right turn perpendicular to the original path.  Saw the same light again just moments later.  Same general location but this time it was moving horizontally across sky and rising.  Again it disappeared behind trees in the area and could only observe for a few minutes.;35.4010000000007;-80.8687999999983
Bright light flares and makes 90 degree turn;2020-06-12 21:00:00;~1 minute;Bright light flares and makes 90 degree turn I observed a bright white light approaching from the east. At first I thought it was Venus or a bright star (I am an amateur astronomer) but it was in the wrong position, much too low and it was moving. It appeared to be an aircraft but did not have any blinking lights and then the intensity of the brightness increased markedly almost like a flare. This increase lasted only a few seconds and it continued westward. I believe it flared once more but cannot remember for sure. As it continued west, it then made a very sharp 90 degree turn north and continued on until I could not see it anymore.  The turn was very abrupt - certainly not like any aircraft that I have seen.;35.4010000000007;-80.8687999999983
