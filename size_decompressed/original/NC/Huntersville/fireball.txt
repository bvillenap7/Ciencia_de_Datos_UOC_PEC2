Orange Pulsating Orbs in Huntersville NC;2019-10-12 21:30:00;5 minute;Orange Pulsating Orbs in Huntersville NC I was driving on Saturday night 10/12/19 at 9:30pm in Huntersville North Carolina. I spotted several Orange pulsating orbs moving in straight line across the sky. These where not Chinese lanterns, Flares, or Airplanes.. I could see directly into the orbs and they appeared to be generating some type of energy pulse. These objects where completely silent. They also appear out of nowhere and  quickly disappeared once they passed by my direct view. The sighting  lasted about 5 minutes one after another. I stopped and took several pictures and a video. I have posted this to YouTube under orange orbs in Huntersville. The news interviewed me and  people are shocked by the footage.;35.4010000000007;-80.8687999999983
