Silver cylinder, upright beer can like, in sky near Charlotte, NC;2020-07-02 20:45:00;15 seconds;Silver cylinder, upright beer can like, in sky near Charlotte, NC I was in a hotel swimming pool doing aerobic exercises while looking up at multiple and impressive contrails in the sky.    It was still light.  The sky was blue with white puffy clouds.  Then I saw what looked like a piece of a flag pole far up in the sky.  I kept looking for how a flag pole could only be partially seen in the sky, where was the rest of it?  At first, there were not clouds near it.  It was silver.  It reminded me of a silver beer can without any writing on it.  It was upright and seemed to be still.  Then a wisp of a puffy cloud obscured it.  When the cloud cleared, it was gone.  I am certain it was not a normal aircraft or drone.  Before this, I had never seen anything before that I was certain qualified as a UFO.  The oddest thing is that I stayed in this hotel two months later, and saw a different thing in the sky.  I will be filing a September report.;35.4010000000007;-80.8687999999983
