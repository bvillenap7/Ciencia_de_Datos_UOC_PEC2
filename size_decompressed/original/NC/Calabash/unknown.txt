Bright yellow/orange lights in sky.;2012-07-18 21:00:00;15 minutes;Bright yellow/orange lights in sky A friend and I were outside her house.   We looked up and saw this big bright yellow/orange light. It flickered, intermittent.  Then a second light lite up bright yellow/orange.  Then they went dim had rapid flickering white lights.  They were moving way too fast for airplanes.  Lights became bright again and moved sideways, fast.  Wasn't sure what we were looking at.  Lights disappeared, so we went inside.   Moved to the back porch area to look for lights .  Saw lights again. When bright lights came, it appeared the object/the stopped.  Once it went dim, it moved.  Very irrational movement.  Movement didn't make sense, did not seem to follow a pattern.  Three lights total, traveling in not quite a triangle shape formation.  Not  sure about the distance from us.  Light when it illuminated was very bright and then dimmed as dull as a night star.  You could clearly see the light flashing as fast as strobe lights when dimmed.  I am a little freaked out by what we saw.  Totally unexplainable.  Now tonight has me really thinking.;33.9054;-78.5719
