A short story of how I saw a UFO.;2018-02-20 08:00:00;10 minutes;A short story of how I saw a UFO. I was standing outside of The Boundary House restaurant in Calabash, North Carolina.  While talking to another employee in the parking lot, I looked South into the sky and where I was looking it seemed to be in a triangle until it began to get closer, I saw two red flashing lights followed by three white flashing lights that seem to be moving together as one but spaced out, both a circular shape.  The three white flashing lights seemed to be in a triangle and the white lights were placed two in the front one in the back.   As the unknown source(s) passes over me and the employeeâ€™s headgoing north, slowly, the red flashing lights were still in front of the three white flashing lights.   This event lasted for about 10 minutes until it passed over the trees where I could no longer see it.;33.9054;-78.5719
