I was taking my husband to work.  It was on a road with little traffic during the day and none at that time of the morning.  There were areas of dense trees on either side of the roadway and large high tension electrical poles on one side of the road.  There was absolutely no traffic at that time of the morning.  As we rounded the bend to go into the main entrance to his worksite, we spotted an object that resembled a chandelier with many tiny white lights.  The moment I said, What the hell is that? the lights instantly turned red.  At that point it moved away from the electrical pole and slowly glided or drifted away.  I wanted to observe it further but my husband was in a rush to get to work on time.  After I dropped him off and went back out I tried to see if it was still there, but it wasn't.  It was definitely intelligently controlled, but did not feel threatened by it.  I was amazed and exhiliated.  It appeared to be approximately 25-30 feet in total diameter, in an oval or round shape with protrusions with white lights on it.  It was quite dramatic and beautiful.  I believe this object was a probe of some type.  As we approached it appeared to be absorbing power from the tension line.  We have never officially reported this to authorities for fear of ridicule, but have shared with some family members. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.9054;-78.5719
