Slow moving light formation.;2013-12-27 22:15:00;2 minutes;Slow moving light formation. Formation of of 3 lights. Two orange or yellow lights on bottom with red on top.  Glowing, almost flickering, definitely not flashing like an airplane.   Moved slowly south towards Calabash , then disappeared.  Elevation like a helicopter traveling.  Could not hear any sound.   Reminded me of a rocket launch.  Saw many of them at night when I lived in Florida.;33.9054;-78.5719
