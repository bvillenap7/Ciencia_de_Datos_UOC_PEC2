While standing in our front yard, waiting for our dog to use the bathroom, me and my wife were looking across the street.  It was cloudy outside with a light sprinkle of rain.  No stars and moon were out.  There was a gentle blowing cool breeze.  We noticed a bright light in the sky to our front.  We thought it was an airplane light. then the light went out.  My wife thought it went in the clouds.  Then all of a sudden, it appeared again, and then there was 3 bright individual lights as if it skipped like a rock skips water.  It went to our left.  There was no noice.  You can hear a pin drop in our neighbourhood. It lasted 3 seconds.  Then it was gone.  Disappeared in the air.  We waited to see if any more activity for 5 mins but there was none.  It was a bright, flash, silvery light that was an oval shape.
