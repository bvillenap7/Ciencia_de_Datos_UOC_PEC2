Brightly glowing orangish colored light flying too low to be normal aircraft.;2010-11-05 21:01:00;3 min.;Brightly glowing orangish colored light flying too low to be normal aircraft. I went outside to smoke a cigarette on the deck attached to my home.I live out in the country so I am constantly surveying the surrounding land for deer and other wildlife both day and night.  As I approached the backside of my deck  I saw an oval shaped bright light which appeared to be only a few hundred feet above the tallest trees in the distant woodline.  I did notice an airplane thousands of feet higher and to the east of the light I could barely remove my eyes from.  This light moved slowly east to west and I follwed it until it went out, like a light, or it just vanished.  I am really unsure although I did choose to not enter my residence for my camera due to deciding to relish the moment and stare in amazement.  I am convinced that this was no aircraft due to my 2 small children and their desire to find airplanes in the night sky with mommy and daddy while out on the deck in the warmer months.  I also briefly compared this light to the airplane that I ob! served seconds after witnessing what I saw tonight.  Oddly, I have a close colleague at work whom also witnessed something similar to what I saw tonight although it has been close to 2 months now and he reported red and orange colored lights opposed to the solid orangish light glow I saw tonight.  I have recently in the past year began to educate myself on UFO's, Nephilim, and Spiritual Warfare.  I have a foreboding sense that tonight may be linked to my studies or I may just be paranoid.....I will report more if anything else is witnessed.;35.6759000000001;-81.9045999999999
