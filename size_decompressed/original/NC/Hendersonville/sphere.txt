Round object-didnt behave like meteor or plane;2001-11-18 05:27:00;20 seconds;Round object-didnt behave like meteor or plane After a whole night of watching countless meteors (including one head on, no less, and seeing at least 10 airplanes, I saw something that didnt fit either plane or meteorite...it was about the the size of the end of my index finger, and was going too slow to be a meteor, and too fast to be a plane. It's direction was also too shallow for a meteor. The thing was bright white, round to slight oval-ish, and went in a 10 degree(?)landing slope. that's the part that threw me. I naturally looked for landing lights on it. It went behind the trees, didnt appear to burn up, and I heard no impact. it left no streak like all the other meteors i had seen that night.
