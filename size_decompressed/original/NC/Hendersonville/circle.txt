Six small solid red lights moved across the sky over Hendersonville, NC, in a North Eastern direction. Three moved in a triangle formation.  Three came to a complete stop for at least 3 minutes.  Two of the three that had stopped, moved back in the direction they came from then, turned back again and moved in the original north eastern direction.  Two simply vanished and the remaining red lights then traveled out of sight.  During this event we noticed two airplanes traveling across the sky and they looked nothing like the red lights.  The sun reflected off of the airplanes making them shine white.;35.3395541666667;-82.4807555555557
Bright white light very low altitude;2011-04-17 20:00:00;10 sec;Bright white light very low altitude On Sunday 4/17/11, I heard loud airplane noises outside, so I went onto my deck to see what it was.  It was 8pm, starting to get dark, the stars were just beginning to shine, and I saw no planes.   I panned the sky and noticed a very bright white light, flying low, slowly, to my southeast (back over my home.)  The deck faces NW.  The light was purposefully ambling along about several hundred feet above treetop level, and only 250 ft south from my position.  I was sure it was no regular flying object, as all I saw was the light.  I observed it for 10 seconds and it traveled to the horizon and was obscured by trees.   I am reporting to confirm two previous reports from NC of the same object.  I believe the object was headed to the NE as I lost sight of it.   Also I live about 8-10  miles south of Asheville airport, and I don't think the noises that I heard at first were related to the object I saw, it seemed silent the whole time I observed it.;35.3395541666667;-82.4807555555557
