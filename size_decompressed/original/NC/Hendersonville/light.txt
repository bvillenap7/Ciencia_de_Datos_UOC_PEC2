3 starlight objects do trickery through the sky for 1 1/2 hour (video footage);2005-08-06 05:00:00;approx 1 hour 30 min;3 starlight objects do trickery through the sky for 1 1/2 hour (video footage) Woke up around 5:00 am to go to bathroom, came to lay back down & looked out window and saw bright star like thing moving around rapidly.  As I continued to watch, it would hover in same spot for 20-30 seconds then shoot rapidly across sky.  Would free fall then stop itself on a dime, doing circles & figure 8's.  We were amazed & thought quickly to get the video camera.  Got a few good shots of it, but it is so fast that it is hard to get good detail.  Eventually saw a straight line drop down from object and then another light began to act erradically also. The 2 would connect then disconnect, and at 1 point a third object was flying in the same manner as the 2 previously listed.  DEFINATELY not military or commercial aircraft.  This went on until dawn and was nolonger visible to the eye.;35.3395541666667;-82.4807555555557

It was at a;2005-10-10 23:00:00;10 Minutes;Last night, October 10, at about 11:00PM for about ten minutes I observed a peculiar point source light in the Eastern sky.  It was at about 30 degrees above the horizon on an apparent bearing of east by north from reference point intersection of I-26 and US64 in Hendersonville, NC moving on an apparent north-south axis across a roughly 20 degree arc, back and forth.  Range undeterminable.   Apparent speed varied from about that of a high altitude passenger jet to twice or more, usually with the lower speed for a distance followed by a high speed burst of from one to seven seconds. The short bursts were sometimes a few seconds apart the longer isolated bursts were after a time at the lower speed.  A passenger jet was crossing at crusing speed north of the area of observation for a speed reference.  There were no audible indications of power plant noise, and no sonic booms, suggestingit wws out of sonic range. The observed object was operating in a traffic free zone.  Acceleration - deceleration was almost instantaneous. Change of course was almost instantaneous, including 180 degree course reversals. Apparent altitude was mainly constant, except for shallow apparent dives during highest speed bursts. In the high speed operations, a hint of a wake or propulsion-generated whitish exhaust could be inferred, but this could not be confirmed. Observatons were from 2,200 feet in a residential area. A yellow street light was behind me. The sky was partly cloudy, but the observed area stayed clear until the end of the observation when the light disappeared behind an apparently very much lower passing cloud. Visibility was very clear.  I am an engineer (BSEE-51, Southern Methodist University) who worked in antisubmarine warfare weapons, systems and tactics for 20 years including R&D operations at sea. I held secret clerance, top secret clearance during the latter part of that time. This was followed by analysis of various advanced electronically controlled capital goods systems. I was a Merchant Marine officer (radio communications) from 1945 through 1950. I do not want publicity. This is in effect a confidential report of observed data for those who can make use of it in a scientific analysis. I would be pleased to cooperate in analyzing this incident, if desirable. My engineering background says extreme performance aircraft in which case I have no need-to-know. The only other things I can think of at the moment are: 1) High intensity light beam played on the bottom of clouds or a vapor layer. But no clouds or vapor layer were evident, nor any beam effect. 2) A large insect close at hand (erratic flight pattern and high rate maneuvers), lighted from below. But, no beam effect, and it would require high intensity lighting from nearby source - none observed). And no luminous insect display, no blinking pattern.;35.3395541666667;-82.4807555555557
Local TV station reports green light in skies over NC.;2007-03-12 00:00:00;30 seconds;Local TV station reports green light in skies over NC. 	I would like to report a UFO reported by a local TV station, WLOS 13. Although I am not a witness to this event, I think it is noteworthy. The station interviewed three people who said they witnessed a green light flaring in the night sky near Hendersonville, NC. The witnesses stated that the light changed brightness and moved erratically. there were also other witnesses, number unknown, who were not interviewed. There was also a drawing of the light made by a witness. It showed a bright light leaving a trail. The witnesses also stated that the green light disappeared with a flash of light. I hope you appreciate this information. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.3395541666667;-82.4807555555557
Do Stars shoot up?;2007-05-05 03:00:00;5 seconds;Do Stars shoot up? I was outside on my front porch having a rather heated debate with a friend on the phone about the existence of UFO's. This went on for awhile, and all of the sudden I looked up to the sky. In that exact moment a light shot through the sky in a semi-circular motion upward. (Kind of made a letter C shape upwards then disappeared.) It could have been a shooting star, but I have never seen a star shoot up. (And I've seen a lot of shooting stars.) Kind of strange considering the conversation I was having on the phone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));35.3395541666667;-82.4807555555557
Star-like objects fade in and out, and move in patterns unusual for conventional aircraft;2008-12-06 18:45:00;Approx. 30 minutes;Star-like objects fade in and out, and move in patterns unusual for conventional aircraft At approx. 6:45 pm on the evening of Saturday Dec 6th, 2008, I had gone to my backyard pool to turn on the filtration system motor. This is a routine procedure I perform in cold weather to keep the water circulating to prevent freezing (in lieu of winterizing). After switching on the motor, I noticed in the western night sky a very bright light slowly moving eastward. Since we live about 20 minutes from a regional airport, I at first didn’t think this was unusual. However as I watched it’s motion, I noticed it had no blinking aircraft lights. As I continued to stare, it suddenly halted movement and then began to move backwards. Eventually it stopped completely and became fixed (now appearing as the brightest “star” in the sky). At this point I ran inside to get my video camera and to notify my two young children of what I had seen.  When we came back outside the object was still there, but was now accompanied by a second star-like light (albeit less bright) off to the lower right.  I began to record as best as I could through the backyard tree limbs which somewhat blocked my view.  Eventually the cold weather forced us indoors, where I continued to film through my upstairs screened-in porch area.  For the next half hour or so my children and I watched in amazement as the two objects alternately moved closer to each other, then moved apart.  In addition they would continually fade in and out, at times becoming completely dark (appearing to us to disappear completely), then suddenly reappearing in full brightness.  At times the second object would become brighter than the first.  Eventually the objects went dark permanently.;35.3395541666667;-82.4807555555557

Very bright object in the sky with faint red light at the top, not a star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2016-01-14 06:30:00;2.5 hours;Very bright object in the sky with faint red light at the top, not a star. My husband and I saw a very bright object in the sky to the east.  It was about a centimeter in diameter, with a faint red light at the top, hovering above a mountain behind our house. It moved very slowly to the right  for over an hour, and then moved upwards for another hour.   An airplane flew in the distance behind the object, so I know for a fact it was not a star.   We were still able to see the object for about 30 minutes after the sun came up.  My husband and I are still in awe, and we are both positive now that we are not alone in the universe.;35.3395541666667;-82.4807555555557
Bright lights hover over Burger King in Hendersonville on Hwy 176;2017-01-07 18:15:00;7 minutes;Bright lights hover over Burger King in Hendersonville on Hwy 176 On January 7th, around 6:30 pm, I observed two bright white lights equally distanced.  They appeared to be an airplane coming towards my direction.  As I got closer, it seemed to stop moving and just hover.  I watched it for 5-7 minutes as I traveled south on Hwy 176.  It appeared to hover over the Macon bank and Burger King Parking lot off Hwy 176.  After I passed the bank, I kept looking back in my mirror but couldn’t see anything.;35.3395541666667;-82.4807555555557
