Wednesday, June 20th 2007 was no different from any other evening in Hendersonville, NC up until around 10:45pm.  The moon was a little under a half moon and barely any clouds in the sky that evening. The moon was bright enough to cast a baby blue hue across the sky, lighting it up as if it we moments before daybreak. Theres a star that usually accompanies the moon in the warm season, its Venus or Saturn or some huge star that is always close to the moon normally.  For some reason, I looked up to see these two hanging in the light blue night…only to find that the star that usually is there by the moon..is now moving at a slow but constant pace. Then looking below it…is another star…a little to the left and below it in the sky moving at the same speed. These weren’t planes or anything man made. It gave me the initial feeling that I was moving and they were not. So I used another star near by as a point of reference, and thought, “Surely those stars won’t pass one another!!!” But yet they did.  The sky was lit to the point where I could plainly see air planes, commercial jet traffic easily and ID them without a doubt. These two moving objects didn’t not have any “outer” structure….and appeared to be so high up…that they weren’t even in our atmosphere. Slowly they made their way up to the top of the sky…then the lead object began climbing. The light emitted from these two were the same if you were looking at the North Star, or a planet in the sky…bright white, but the size of a star. No flashing…no changing color…no erratic movement.  As they climbed, I could tell that they were leaving or going higher because their light began to dim.  Within about 20 seconds of this climb, they both disappeared into the sky.  I’m really hoping that someone else saw this. I’m not a huge believer in this kind of stuff, but this was really something amazing.;35.3395541666667;-82.4807555555557
Amber-colored object,shaped like a kitchen match,still, no movement,faded away.;2012-07-04 23:00:00;5 minutes;amber colored object,shaped like a kitchen match,still, no movement,faded away. I am a graphic designer & sign painter, I am very aware of my surroundings, it's my job.  Driving home late on the 4th after 11pm in a rural area, mountains all over, I saw an amber colored object sitting still in the western sky. I pulled over.  The object was shaped like a kitchen match.  It was horizontal & very still.  I could not believe what I was seeing!  No noise, no movement, just there.  Watched it for 5 minutes, & then it slowly faded out of sight like a dimmer switch was used.  I had a cell phone, but I never got it out to take a picture.  It just never crossed my mind.;35.3395541666667;-82.4807555555557
