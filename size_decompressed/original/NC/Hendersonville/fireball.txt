Fireball seen by sheriff's deputy;2009-03-20 02:30:00;unknown;Fireball seen by sheriff's deputy On March 20, 2009, WLOS TV Asheville reported that six witnesses helping passengers in a car crash saw a large fireball in the sky over Henderson County.  A group of six people reported seeing a fireball, said to be too large to be a meteor, moving towards the ground.  The witnesses all saw the same object, and they described it as appearing with a large tail, turning a greenish color approaching the ground. A sheriff's deputy was among the witnesses.  The group said that they thought the object had crashed nearby, but they did not see any fire or indication of impact.   A truck driver on I-26 also reported a fireball and made a 911 call to the Hendersonville Police department.  In another, possibly seperate case, a TV station in Gastonia, Georgia, also recieved reports of fireballs at approximately the same date and time.  I was not a witness to this case, but I thought it would be of interest to NUFORC. If you need any more info, contact WLOS 13 in Asheville, NC.
