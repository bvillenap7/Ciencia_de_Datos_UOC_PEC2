Translucent cylindrical silent aircraft Seen near Asheville North Carolina;2020-10-06 14:40:00;10 seconds;Translucent cylindrical silent aircraft Seen near Asheville North Carolina I was standing on my deck while watching a older model mono wing aircraft, do and practice barrel rolls about 1000 feet up when something else caught my vision and I looked slightly downward to see a translucent cylinder heading in an west to east pattern flight and as it entered rays of the sun it became visible and then would disappear and then become visible again as it hit another Ray, this happened three times before it finally just disappeared into the blue sky. It had no wings and there were no contrails. Also there was no sound and this cylinder I saw it was much closer than the aircraft doing the barrel rolls. I was facing south when I saw this at about 90 degrees.;35.7078;-82.6358
