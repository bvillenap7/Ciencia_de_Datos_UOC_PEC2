I watched a cigar shaped object with binoculars hover for 2 hours (23:30-1:30am) until cloud cover impeded my view. It was located at 150 degrees SE from my side yard at approximately a 25 degree inclination. It had lights across the midsection of the shape and appeared to move slowly East as the object became smaller. It never disappeared or changed altitude. I go outside every night to view the sky and have never seen this before. Woke my husband, a retired satellite engineer, up who also saw the object. Neither of us could find an explaination of something that could stay stationary for that length of time.;35.7078;-82.6358
