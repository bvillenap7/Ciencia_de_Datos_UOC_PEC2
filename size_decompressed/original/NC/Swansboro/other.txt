I got out of my car to check the mailbox, looked up and saw up in the sky a red square with what it looked like yellow in the middle with what looked like a crosss on it.   He proceeded to go west, and then looked like it turned into still a red circle, then dropped.  I came across a video on YouTube and saw one that looked exactly like it.

Silent U-shaped aircraft performing evasive maneuvers from a military helicopter on its tail in the dead of night.;2021-03-07 00:00:00;Minutes;silent U-shaped aircraft performing evasive maneuvers from a military helicopter on its tail in the dead of night. U-shaped aircraft spotted heading south on highway-24 whilst driving home from the Jacksonville Airport to Swansboro.  Aircraft was being chased by a helicopter that at once had to do a full 180 degree turn to catch up to the evasive aircraft.  When questioning other witnesses and showing pictures of the Solar Powered aircraft invented by Boeing I was told “ I don't think so. There were no corners. It appeared to be seamless. Almost fluid, if that makes any sense.”  The craft made zero noise and had 4 green lights and was flying super low above the trees whilst being chased.;34.7002000000001;-77.134
