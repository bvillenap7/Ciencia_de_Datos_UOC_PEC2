30+ orange lights flying in formation.;2013-11-09 19:40:00;3 minutes;30+ orange lights flying in formation I was driving south on highway 601 yesterday evening (it was already dark). I was slowing down to actually get on 601 at a yield sign when my boyfriend pointed out bright orange lights in the sky.  I pulled over and we watched.  The objects were a little larger than a plane would be.  I counted and saw at least 30 of them.  At first I actually thought it could be an extremely odd and rare view of a constellation of some sort, but I soon realized this was not the case.  They were in formation moving west to east at a constant speed. Then, as if planned, they began entering a new formation.  They continued traveling and then I could not see them anymore.  I believe other people saw it because as I continued driving I saw another car stopped in the road.  I wish I could have recorded it or taken a picture, but our phones would not pick them up.;36.3678;-80.7057
