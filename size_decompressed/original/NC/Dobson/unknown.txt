Hovering aircraft over the Dobson,Pilot Mt.,Mt. Airy,area.;2016-10-19 21:30:00;1 hour+;Hovering aircraft over the Dobson,Pilot Mt.,Mt. Airy,area. I heard a loud aircraft come over my house.  Thought it might be a helicopter, but the sound was similar to a turbo prop, but deeper in tone, but without the sound of the props.  It continued moving east,maybe fifteen miles and begin hovering.  As it hovered,I begin observing the lights hoping to identify the craft.  There were red lights,one at the top,one at the bottom,and one in the middle.  The top light blinked once every to seconds.the bottom light randomly blinked three times every two seconds.  There was continuos white lights through the middle and randomly blinking lights at the bottom, sometimes blinking in sequence.  It appeared to be three lights along the bottom.  Running diagonally,from lower left to upper right  white,green,and blue lights that appeared to blink with no apparent pattern. It seemed this first craft would be joined by three others ,similar to the first, but two disappeared before joining, they came from the south.  The fourth came from the north and began hovering some distance from the first, just above the horizon.  While hovering , both craft would move short distances in random directions while maintaining  their approximate positions.   After about an hour I returned to the inside of my house.  Tonight 10/20/16  another craft appeared above the horizon in a similar area for about an hour.. Commercial and military aircraft fly by and seem to not notice the hovering craft,however I noticed they all turned before entering the craft's air space. There is no noise from these craft as thy hover.;36.3678;-80.7057
