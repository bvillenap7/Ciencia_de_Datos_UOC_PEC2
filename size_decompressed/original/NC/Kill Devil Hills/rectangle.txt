IT WAS GOING SLOWLY AND IT WAS APROX 200 FT FROM SHORE LINE AND ABOUT 400 FT HIGH, AND IT CHANGED DIRECTIONS AND STARTED OUT TO SEA.  IT HAD NO DEPTH. WHEN IT WAS ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE OUT IT PAUSED AND THEN WENT STRAIGHT UP UNTIL IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT. A FISHERMAN NEXT TO ME SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS AND MY BROTHER IN LAW AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER SAID THE SAME THING. I ASKED IF ANY KITES WERE IN AREA AND MAN WHO FLIES KITES SAID HE WAS NOT FLYING ANY THAT DAY. RED AND GREEN LIGHT ON LEFT SIDE.;36.0082;-75.6795000000001
