Stationary red/white lights over Kill Devil Hills.;2015-06-10 22:00:00;1 hour;Stationary red/white lights over Kill Devil Hills. Sitting outside on our deck, looking at the stars, noticed what we thought was a star, but it had a red light in addition to the white and did not appear to be moving.  Thought perhaps it was a helicopter hoovering but seemed too high in the sky.   After observing it for at least 30 minutes, the star/aircraft never moved. Began looking around the skyline and noticed at least 5 other stationary objects with the same red/white lights and they were also not moving.   Took out the binoculars and it was clear these were not stars, but stationary objects with the red and white lights. Will continue observing but for now these objects have not moved for over an hour;36.0082;-75.6795000000001
