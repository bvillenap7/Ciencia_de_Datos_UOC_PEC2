saw  two in sync circle formations cicleing around eachother,v line formation,single and multiple orange glowing crafts.slow with pace;2010-07-03 23:40:00;1 hour;saw  two in sync circle formations cicleing around each other,v line formation, single and multiple orange glowing crafts.slow with pace we were lighting fire works at our beach house and my kids were playing with glow sticks when we looked up and saw eight glowing orange orbs in two circles of four over lapping and spinning around eachother within eachother.  they continued spinng at cloud level.the objects then they spread out and dissapeared.after that several single crafts began flying past at a very low speed then would shoot off.about ten minutes after the first circleing formation from the same direction a line of about fourteen crafts came out of now where in a v formation.as soon as those crats got off to about the same distance they dispersed and we could no longer see them.within this whole hour of activity we witnessed many of the crafts just zig zagiing around the skies and continue to dissapear at the same location of the others.occasionally two would fly side by side and somewhat zig zag in sync with each other.the last crafts we saw were three flying together in a triangle and ! dissapeared at the same location they seemed to appear from.there is no logical explination i could think of for what me and the four others i was with saw.;36.0082;-75.6795000000001

My daughter and I saw five ufos in a formation. They were shaped like a triangle but not a full triangle.  They were dark orange and just seemed to vanish in the same place one after the other.;36.0082;-75.6795000000001
