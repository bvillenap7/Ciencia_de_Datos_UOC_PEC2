The object appeared to be at a distance of 30-50 miles to the south. The object roze to a height of approx. 5,000-10,000 feet and then appeared to fly south at a very high rate of speed. Light emmited from the craft dimmed gradually and was gone within 5 seconds. This pattern was repeated at least 4 more times with about 2-3 minutes of separation between crafts.

Saw 4 reddish lights moving north along the Atlantic coast in Kill Devil Hills, NC.;2014-08-14 20:50:00;5 minutes;Saw 4 reddish lights moving north along the Atlantic coast in Kill Devil Hills, NC While driving south along the beach road (milepost 6.5), I observed (at first) 2 bright reddish lights in the sky moving slowly north.   I pulled over and stopped the car and got out to have a closer look.  I would estimate that the lights were just off shore (@ 1/4 mile away).  I then noticed 2 more identical lights also moving slowly north.   The first set of lights were low in the sky (one light was above and to the left of the second light) and they moved very slowly to the north and made no noise at all.  The first set of lights passed by me and the first light appeared to make a right turn and went out to sea and disappeared.   The second light followed the first light a few seconds later and also disappeared out to sea.  I then focused on the second set of identical lights that appeared to be @ 1/4 mile behind the first set.  They were in the very same formation and followed the first set out to sea.   In total, I would estimate the event lasted @ 5 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));36.0082;-75.6795000000001
