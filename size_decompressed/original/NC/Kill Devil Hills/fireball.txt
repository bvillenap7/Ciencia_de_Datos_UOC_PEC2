Four fireballs moving across the night sky.;2012-07-29 03:00:00;1-2 minutes;Four fireballs moving across the night sky. My family and I were on vacation last week in the Outer Banks, NC.  Specifically Kill Devil Hills, NC.  On Friday July 29th 2012 at about 3am we were outside in the area pool when I looked up and saw 2 round bright lights, which it looked liked initially, headed in our direction.   My first thought was it looked like a commercial airliner coming towards us.  I was surprised on how close this object was in the night sky.  After watching for a few moments it was clear they were 2 round balls of orange fire.   They stayed parallel to each other as they moved across the sky moving from north to south. They weren't streaking in the sky and there was no apparent tail behind them.   We watched for about 20-25 seconds and as they moved above us, they then faded away at the same time.   About 10 seconds later, another single round ball of orange fire followed about the same path, about another 20-25 seconds and faded away in the same area.   Again, about 10-15 seconds later, a larger ball of fire, this time more reddish in color followed and faded away in the same area in the sky.  During the entire event, no sound was emitted.   All four of us witnessed this event and cannot come to a conclusion to what it was.  I've scoured the internet and haven't been able to find a sighting reported in the area.   I wish I had my phone with me as I'm sure I could of recorded very clear images or video, but unfortunately I did not.   Any information you can provide me with would be greatly appreciated.;36.0082;-75.6795000000001
