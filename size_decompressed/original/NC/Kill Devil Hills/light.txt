Naturally my first thought was “that’s neat they are now using orange for the headlights of airplanes” this was cool enough to alert my friend.  When the lights disappeared I believed the “airplane” to have passed behind some low clouds.  Momentarily the lights came back on, now both of us being witness to the event we were awe struck by the new orange plane lights.   Suddenly three more sets of lights each identical to the first and parallel to the ocean, separated from the first set.  Now there are four sets of two lights each, each pair moving independently from the rest.  The sets of lights are identical to each other.   Suddenly all four sets of lights disappeared at the exact same time leaving the night sky as pitch black as it was previously. Upon our return to the house to file this report and tell our friends about the siting we experienced some issues with our technological devices.  One of our phones went from a full battery to less than 25% and refused to charge in outlets that were working earlier today.  The other phone was also at full battery until I turned on the laptop at which point it went down to half and then back up to full.;36.0082;-75.6795000000001
Bright orange, round light.;2016-03-07 01:52:00;6 minutes;Bright orange, round light First, only saw 1 bright orange round light, so bright I saw it through blinds.   I got up and looked at it.  A second bright orange light came towards the first.  The first one went straight up in sky, very fast until it was unseen.  The second went towards the west.;36.0082;-75.6795000000001
