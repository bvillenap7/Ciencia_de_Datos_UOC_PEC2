At first I thought it was a falling/shooting star, but instead of fading after a second or two, it became a bright white color, increased in size and shot off to the east horizontally.   When the object got larger and brighter right before it shot off it almost looked like it was oval in size and it gave off a colorful refraction of light (like sunlight bouncing off a crystal) with the bright white flare.  There was no noise heard during the sighting of the anomaly and it only lasted 3-5 seconds.;36.0082;-75.6795000000001
