Large wedge shaped UFO.;2012-11-30 18:00:00;5 minutes;Large wedge shaped UFO I am a 43 year old man, Professional Land Surveyor, and I have a 9 year old son who was with me during the incident.  Also, with me was a 45 year old male friend who is a construction worker.  We live on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, next to where the Wright Brothers first flew.   We all basically agree with the following account. All three of us were getting on our bicycles to ride to a cook out a few blocks away in our neighborhood.  It was 6pm November 30th, 2012 Friday night.  It had been dark for about 45 minutes.  We rode down the street a few hundred feet, heading basically north, when some red lights caught my eye through the live oak trees.  Seconds later, an aircraft emerged from behind the tree line.  It was a black or charcoal gray craft.  Estimated 200 feet long tip of the triangle to its base, 100 ft wide at its base and 15ft tall.  Flying virtually silently about 300 ft off of the ground and traveling in a seemingly straight line about 15-25 mph.   It flew very slow and quiet for a craft of this size.  I have seen Stealth Bombers and Stealth fighters, it was at least as big as the bomber, probably bigger, but not shaped the same and much more quiet. There were rows of red lights lining the bottom of the craft on either side from the tip to the base, but not along the base of the traingle shape.  No lights went on and off like FAA planes.  All lights were red, some pulsated seemingly randomly but stayed relatively dim compared to the lights on the points of the triangle and never went out or blinked.  The lights at the points of the triangle seemed to be the brightest lights.  The craft flew almost directly over our heads, just west of us, so we had to crane our necks to look up at it because was so close.  We watched it slide slowly past us and continue in its northerly direction until we lost sight of the lights behind the trees and houses north of us.  As it passed our position, a low humming rumble noise could be heard, but it was by no means loud like a jet or propeller.  It was not a blimp.  We would have been able to see the blimp above the craft because it was so low.  Also the blimp would have had to been li! ke 1000 feet long to lift the structure we saw. I am not convinced this is not some semi-secret military operation, as we have Oceana Naval Air Station near us to the north.  However, they are obviously not concerned about people seeing the craft flying the way it flew over the fairly densely populated area here on that night last week. This is a true account, it happened.  What we saw is real, whatever it is.  I am not a UFO enthusiast, I am a hard facts guy.   We saw what we saw, and whatever it was is a reality.;36.0082;-75.6795000000001
Multiple sightings over the past few weeks on the OBX.;2014-01-26 04:00:00;10 minutes;Multiple sightings over the past few weeks on the OBX This was a bright white light that started out near the moon.   Within a 20 min period it dropped much more then normal and the other stars in the area. it then became much closer and using a tree line to distort its shape.   I eventually saw a half circle with lights running back and forth from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock.   It seemed to back away when I tried to video tape it with my phone.   I have had similar encounters (3) since Christmas 2013.;36.0082;-75.6795000000001
