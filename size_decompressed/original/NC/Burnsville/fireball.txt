Fireball in the sky while viewing Mars 10/31/05;2005-10-31 21:30:00;appox 2 min;Fireball in the sky while viewing Mars 10/31/05 My husband and I were getting the telescope setup to view Mars.  The sky was very clear, there were no lights since we are in the mountains.  We hadn't completed the setup yet, but we were looking at Mars when we both saw a bright fireball, from our perspective it was about 6 down and 4 to the right.  The fireball was traveling N to S we assumed it was space junk or a satellite, because it had a fire trail behind it.  The fireball went out several seconds after it appeared, but the burning trail lasted for a couple of minutes.  With the naked eye we saw blue and white colors only.  Was this just a satellite?  We haven't been able to find any info about it.;35.903;-82.2875999999998
