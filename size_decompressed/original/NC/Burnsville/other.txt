Witnessed for over an hour. Video footage. The event took place in a heavily populated area and was witnsessed by two people.  The craft was watched for half an hour before one of the witnesses took a video.   The craft was very oddly shaped with only one light shining at first.  As one witness tried to get closer the craft moved away and many more lights became visible.   The craft hovered over a house for several minutes and was noiseless.  It also moved away at breakneck speeds disappearing over a mountain before returning to hover over the same house only minutes later.   I personally have seen the video and have no rational explanation for what the craft may be.;35.903;-82.2875999999998
