On this particular morning I was sitting on the couch looking out the picture window when I saw it...a round silvery white craft flying very slow and very low, maybe 20 yards in front of the house. It scared me so bad, I flew back to bed. I saw the very same type craft 21 years later. I was 30, married, with one child and another on the way. I don't know why that seems significant. The time was around 12 noon on a Friday and I was sitting in the turn-off lane to go to McDonald's to get some lunch. I had my 3 year-old daughter with me. She saw nothing though. The craft flew over some trees on the side of the highway, seemed to stop directly over where I was, hovered a few seconds and then zoomed away at lightening speed, faster than a jet. I know that it was faster than a jet because I thought, I'll be able to see it when I get closer to my house. I never saw it anymore. It was gone. Funny thing, I asked around to see if anyone else saw anything strange in the town of Burnsville that Friday at 12 noon. Evidently I was the only one who saw it. Or anyone else would feel stupid admitting to seeing something like that. But I know what I saw, both times. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.903;-82.2875999999998
