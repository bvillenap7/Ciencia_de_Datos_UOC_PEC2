On the first report the hour time is 19:45 hours on the update the day date is 11/29 . thank you  2.)Today I heared of a second sighting in Burnsville, NC on 11/29/05.  I was in Appalachian Java, a little coffee shop we have on Main street. I met a friend I hadn't seen for a while and started telling (yet again) about the event of the 29th,when the owner of the shop offers that another person was in a couple of weeks ago saying ,her sister saw somthing also.  He told me her name and after returning home I made contact with the sister and her husband.  this is what he told me he came home soon after dark.  After a ''short while'' (didn't mention the time) he went to the car for something, he noticed a group of lights  different (bright white and red) in the sky moving in strange patterns the sky. The lowest being 10 degrees above the horizen (he said ,that one being in the direction of my house ). His wife brought binoculars from the house and he tryed to focus on the crafts, but he said they didn't seem to ''hold a shape''.  His wife lost interest after about a minute .  He watched them for about 5 minutes until the last one ,the one in the direction of my house, ''faded'' from view.;35.903;-82.2875999999998
A dark object with dull lights 200-300 yrds up in the sky , moving in total silence;2005-11-29 18:45:00;5 seconds;A dark object with dull lights 200-300 yrds up in the sky , moving in total silence At 7:45 pm est 11/29/05 ,(one hour ago) I was standing on my deck which faces south. I happened to look up in the south sky I noticed a grouping of lights moving across the sky, moving east to west through our valley. They were dull lights and the object seemed to blend with the dark sky background .It moved in total silence .I listened for a moment and could hear nothing. It looked as if it was 200-300 yards up ,about the size ,if you hold 3 fingers horizontal at arms length in front of you . ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed quite credible to us.  PD));35.903;-82.2875999999998
super fast , moving  light;2010-04-05 22:30:00;1 second;super fast , moving  light I was sitting on the north side of my home staring at the stars when a very fast ''strobe like'' light zipped by overhead.  Not  leaving a trail like a meteor ,so fast  it seemed to ''strobe'' across the sky. north to south. It was not a ''dot '' of light , but seemed horizontal.  Really too fast to see a  clear shape and i mean zipped across the sky !  It made no sound;35.903;-82.2875999999998
3 sets of 3 lights hovering silently in night sky;2010-10-19 21:19:00;about 2 minutes;3 sets of 3 lights hovering silently in night sky I regret not finding your site and filing this as soon as this happened, but better late than not. At about 9:30 on a mid-October night in 2010 while walking my dog, I noticed lights in the southeast sky from our front yard.  I regularly observe the night skies and am familiar with the usual constellations at different times of the year, and follow the movements of planets as well.  I live outside of Burnsville, NC, in a very rural area with little light pollution, and the night sky was clear. What I saw were three sets of lights, each set arranged as three points of an equilateral triangle, and those arranged as a triangle.  The lights were not blinking, two, maybe three of them had a greenish color.  They were low on the horizon, I detected no solid shape associated with them.  Most unusual was the three sets of lights moved, slightly up and down, with respect to each other.  I tested this by positioning myself in a place in the yard where I could align the top of a hemlock tree (stationary in a breeze-less night) to a set of lights, which definitely moved with respect to the treetop.  I detected no sound, nor was able to perceive how far away they were. After watching this for one minute, maybe more, I rushed inside the house to get my wife and daughter to see it, and by the time they were alerted and out, the lights were gone, not visible anywhere else in the sky.  I regret not waiting to see how they disappeared. Having watched the night sky where I live for many years, seen the ISS several times, seen comets, a bolide, assorted aircraft, Iâ€™d never witnessed lights like these and the fact that they moved was compelling.
