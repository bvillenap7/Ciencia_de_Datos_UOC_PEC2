Light orb in daylight;2005-05-05 15:00:00;30 seconds;Light orb in daylight We were parked at the top of a state park in a parking area on Mount Mitchell in North Carolina.  My sister and I were sitting in a parked car, while our mother was finishing her hike.  We could see across a valley onto the next mountain.  We could see the trail that people were walking up.  We could see the people as they were hiking up that trail.   A light orb hovered up the mountain in a fashion unlike the people.  It went to a ledge and hovered for around 10-15 seconds.  After that it went to the top peak of the mountain and shot off at an extremely fast speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));35.903;-82.2875999999998
