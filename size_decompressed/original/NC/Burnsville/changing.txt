Star-like, color changing triangle shape object;2009-10-20 01:55:00;2:27;Star-like, color changing triangle shape object My outside dog began barking around 0130 am as he has done the last couple nights, which is unusual for him. Determined to find out what was causing this commotion I began looking out my windows. I saw what appeared to be a blinking star at first. Then it began to change shape like a white inner ball with intermittent red and blue lights forming a triangle around it. I woke up my son to see this object. It moved gracefully up and down and from side to side. I put new batteries in my digital camera and went out on the porch to try and photograph it. Snapped one shot not catching the object and the camera flashed the battery symbol and went off.Then is when I noticed what appeared o be two lights on the bottom of the object. My cell phone camera would not pick up the object. My inside cat and dog were going crazy! We watched this for over 25 minutes and then I went to get my husbands binoculars and when I found them and came back to the window it was gone. T! here was no noise at all the whole time. Then my pets went back to normal and I watched the rest of the night but seen nothing else.;35.903;-82.2875999999998
