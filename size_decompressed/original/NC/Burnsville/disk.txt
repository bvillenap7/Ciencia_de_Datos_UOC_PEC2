Approximately 2 miles west of Burnsville, NC, I observed a disk shaped craft, illuminated by the flashes of lighting.  I only saw the craft once, I searched the sky several more times, but was unable to spot the craft again.  At arm's length the craft was at least the size of a quarter, probably 800-1000 ft high and was extremely shiny.  I cannot say about sound as I was driving at the time.;35.903;-82.2875999999998
