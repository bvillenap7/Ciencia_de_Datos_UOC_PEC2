The phoenix lights again???;2006-07-04 21:10:00;2-3 mins;The phoenix lights again??? Looked exactly like the phoenix lights. We (my wife and I) were sitting in the back of our explorer, waiting for the fireworks to begin. I saw the orbs slowly moving across the sky, in perfect formation, just as I turned my camcorder on they were gone. I am NOT some UFO freak, I have never claimed to see anything before, I am VERY skeptical of these things. Just recenlty relocated to NC from Wash, DC;35.9148;-78.4609
Formation of  18-20 red flashing lights in the sky ... eventually disappeared;2010-05-05 20:48:00;5 minutes;Formation of  18-20 red flashing lights in the sky ... eventually disappeared My husband and I saw a string of about 18-20 reddish flashing/blinking lights in the sky.  Some in groups of 3, some in pairs and others single.   We at first thought that they were simply planes in formation, but as the were flying farther north, some would disappear.  My husband, a pilot, realized they were not planes, but we couldn't figure out what they were.  All of them eventually disappeared.
