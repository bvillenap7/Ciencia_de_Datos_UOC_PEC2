Green blinking orb traveling at a very high rate of speed.;2013-06-21 01:15:00;5 seconds;Green blinking orb traveling at a very high rate of speed. I witnessed a green orb moving east to west across the sky.  The object blinked approximately one time each second.  At first blink, I assumed it was just a normal aircraft, but by the second blink it had traversed nearly a quarter of the night sky.  The object traveled the entire night sky in approximately 5 seconds.  This distance is measured from east horizon/top of tree line to west horizon/top of tree line east (estimated 150 degree field of view).   I have witnessed many satellites, planes, the space shuttle,  & ISS  and have never seen anything move across the sky this fast.    I have witnessed meteorites moving this fast, but this object maintained a straight line of flight until it was out of range.   For reference, the night was perfectly clear, and the object made no sound.   Thank you for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
