Strange activity throughout the day, such as WiFi interference, cable TV Interference, lots of airplanes & such, BUT one such odd event was a triangular shaped objects (below radar) in the sky that was motionless, but had a mostly red glow with green hue to it.   to it, after a short period, one made a u-turn & darted off towards Charlotte, & the other object lowered down & hovered, once the 1st one was gone, the other one stayed behind, shortly after the 1st one left, something came back from the direction that the 1st one went to, but this time it was a red ball, similar to a firework & and it appeared to have landed to across the highway,not to be seen again.after that, the 2nd one was gone.   my son, his wife, my husband, and our neighbors, AND their friends saw this.;35.5175;-81.4578000000001
