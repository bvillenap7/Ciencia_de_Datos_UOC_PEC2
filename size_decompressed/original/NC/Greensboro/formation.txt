Triangle of lights in odd, very spread out formation;2017-01-25 18:30:00;2 minutes;Triangle of lights in odd, very spread out formation Was walking our dog, looking up I saw a formation of 3 lights in a triangle formation in the distance, there was about a visual inch between the lights.  They were blinking, I thought they might be jets in the distance, but as I have thought about it for over 18 hours it may have been other-worldly.  They were in the north of the city traveling east along treetop level per my perspective.   The top light was ahead of the bottom one and the bottom one was ahead of the back one which formed an  obtuse triangle.  Being that far apart at that distance would make them several miles apart in the formation, which I think is strange for any jet formation, they were going about the speed of a commercial jet, not fast as if military and I did not hear a the jet engine.   There were no wild movements nor disappearances.  Also, as far as I could tell they blinked at pretty much the same interval.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
23 unidentified flying objects in single file formation, flying at a high rate of speed.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-28 21:30:00;5 minutes;23 unidentified flying objects in single file formation, flying at a high rate of speed. Observed 23-25 airborne objects flying approximately at 25,000 feet in single file formation at a high rate of speed in a SSE direction.  Observable for about 5 minutes.  Each craft had red navigational lights at the forward tip of the aircraft.  No audible engine noise. Moonlight was present against a clear dark sky.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
