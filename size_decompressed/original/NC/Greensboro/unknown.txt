High Explosion-Loud Hish-Ground-shaking Boom;2009-01-25 03:15:00;7 to 9 seconds;High Explosion-Loud Hish-Ground-shaking Boom January 26, 2009  12:51 AM  Nancy Woodell McCracken 413 Woodlawn Avenue Greebsoro, NC 27401 TE 336- 274-4135 e-mail nwmccracken@earthlink.net  Report for January 25, 2009, 3:16 AM for National UFO Reporting Center  As I was working at the computer in the back room of my house,  I heard a terrifically loud seemingly close explosion. In the moment I was thinking, Okay, the tranformer just blew out,  I am about to loose power and all this work, I heard  about 2 seconds later a close intense LOUD hishing-whooshing sound,  as if something passed over head and down. Then in THAT moment I  thought, Who's firing an illegal-grade bottle rocket. Upon hearing  a second LOUD boom that shook the ground enough to notice, not violently,  I thought, Oh My God, has a house blown up?. I turned to look out  the window to my west because the motion lights came on outside  due to the movment of the taller shubbery in a stiff sudden breeze. It was aleast a 20-25 mph gust from the north. The sonic incident  lasted a total of about 7 to 9 seconds, and there was no light of any  that I noticed. The gust of wind was short-lived. I was headed for  the telephone, so I did not time it. Fearing a gas leak/explosion, I called 911. This was at approximately  3:20 AM. The operator did not even ask details of my home address,  however, she did ask if I was near certain streets in my neighborhood. Within 30 seconds numerous police and fire vehicles were headed into  my neighborhood, and I went out to see and speak to an officer, telling  exactly what I experienced. My husband was asleep, but was awake when I  called for him, he says something woke him, but he did not know what it  was. He did mention feeling a tremble or shaking. He was upstairs. At 3:30 AM my neighbor was walking from the north end of Woodlawn Avenue,  to his house at the next block south. He does not wish to be identified. He is a retired, very well educated professional in educational and  technical fields. He was awakened by the second loud boom, percieved that  it was at ground level, and had headed down the street because he was  sure someone's house had blown up. We dicussed, I told of the preceding  boom and whoosh-hishh, and that strange wind gust. It was very cold, and  I went inside, and called your hot-line. Police and fire sirens were continually heard from 3:20 AM to at least 4:45 AM by me, going all around the surrounding area from downtown to  northern Greensboro. I checked the weather conditions, because I wondered that this could have  somehow been a meteor event that was somehow without visible light. The  ceiling was 3500 feet and below, winds were 5 mph, the clouds were thick,  the humidity only 44%, temperature was 29 degrees F. I am 50 years old, well-educated I suppose, and a professional musician. I often work at night in my home. Unless someone tells me otherwise, I  know that first BOOm was above ground, sonic in nature, and am doubtful  that it was produced by military aircraft. My father was a pilot, and  in the 1960s we grew up under a sky where the military practiced sound  barrier breaking. That whhosh-hisshh was a descending sound. The second  BOOM was near or on ground level, the floor did shake. The wind, possibly,  associated with the event, I can't be sure. There is an expansive park in the area where, from my perspective, this  event concluded, and the fast wind came from that area. As of now, no news  of damage, explosions, mischief, or anything else are known to me. If you  have more info or need more, please feel free to contact me. Thank you.

A slow moving bright white light growing brighter then dimmed to a small dull point with similar dull point of light moving slowly dull;2011-03-16 10:30:00;5 min;A slow moving bright white light growing brighter then dimmed to a small dull point with similar dull point of light moving slowly dull Just happen to glance up in North-eastern direction at roughly 45 degrees I saw a bright white light, which seemed to be perhaps as far away as satillites, growing brighter and larger, larger than any star, and yet was moving very slowly away from me because I was looking through the leafless branches of a tree in my backyard and could therefore judge movement.  The white light, somewhat elongated, grew larger and brighter and then became dimmer and smaller until it was a very small dull point of light in a short amount of time.  At the moment it reached that stage I saw a similar dull point of light to its left, about the distance apart as two fingers at arms length.  This point of light was also moving very slowly but towards me, not away from me as the other now dim dull light was doing, as I could judge this looking through the branches of the tree.  I quickly went inside to get my camera and was back outside in less than 30 seconds and I could not see anyth! ing left of the two objects. I have an 10 telescope and have enjoyed studying the night sky for over 16 years.  I keep an open and critical mind about this phenomenon.  I have studied the worldwide phenomenon of Crop Circles for 5 years and have read much of Colin Andrews, Freddy Silva, Nancy Talbot and others and well as the photographs by Steve Alexander.  I mention this only to show my openness to what I think is a tangible form of communication by other intelligences than from this planet.  My conclusions come from the preponderance of data that point to a technology that is able to channel several forms of energy simultaneously to manipulate plants to create extraordinary geometric formations within a timespan of minutes and no more than a couple of hours. These findings lead me to believe there are intelligences visiting us and gently trying to communicate to us through the use of symbols found in the Crop Circles. I have made no assumptions nor conclusions about what I saw. I am just relating what I saw. Lastly, just moments after returning with my camera and not seeing anything left of these dull moving points of lights, a jet airline with its blinking lights made its way towards my direction, following the established corridor for both civilian airlines as well as military jets, planes and helicoptors in this sector of the sky.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
2 speeding orange-red lights, zigzagging, with one seemingly bouncing off the other a few times.;2011-10-16 22:00:00;<1 minute;2 speeding orange-red lights, zigzagging, with one seemingly bouncing off the other a few times. Over Lindley Park neighborhood saw two orange-red lights travelling NW at high rate of speed.   They zigzagged a few times and one seemed to bounce off of the other one.  It was surreal.  Looked like some Atari video game in the sky.  The night was very clear and I could see several planes in the sky at the same time.  But these 2 orange-red lights were moving MUCH faster, appeared to be at a much higher altitude than the planes, and did not have any blinking lights.  It almost seemed as though one was chasing the other. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Taking daughter for a walk and saw two redish orange lights spread apart bigger then a football field then disappeared into thin air!!!;2014-06-01 21:27:00;~2-3minutes;taking daughter for a walk and saw two redish orange lights spread apart bigger then a football field then disappeared into thin air!!! me and my fiance were taking our daughter on a walk it was about 9:27 pm today june 1st 2014 when my fiance says look! i look upwards and there were two bright redish orange lights far apart the width between the lights were very far apart it looked longer then a football field.  It seemed pretty close and there was no sound at all what so ever theres no way it could have been a air plane my grandfather was in the airforce so i know the difference between the two.  My fiance pulled out his camera and started recording as soon as he did the furthest light started what seem like throbbing and trying to fade out and as it was trying to fade out the unidentified aircraft start turning and the lights were no longer aligned side to side but looked almost diagonal then the one light completely went out then the closest light faded and eventually went out as well the whole time me and my fiance were backing away from it to get under a tree because we are ! not taking any risks you never know what could happen and i was not goin to put my 4 month old at risk or exposure but my fiance did record it until it faded completely out and disappered into thin air my whole body was shaking and my heart was beating so fast i called my mother right away and we quickly walked back to our apartment and called in the event.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Green light seen near fireworks Greensboro, NC.;2015-07-04 21:00:00;15 minutes;Green light seen near fireworks Greensboro, NC. While watching fireworks from Greensboro coliseum, me and my wife saw what we thought was an airplane, until it stopped for a moment, turned right, moved towards the fireworks, then stopped for 5 to 10 minutes.  Backed up, went up and down, moved forward, stopped again for 5 minutes or so, then moved away stopping briefly, then going out of sight.  All moves were sharp angles.

Object moving away from moon.;2016-10-03 05:00:00;5 minutes;Object moving away from moon. I was outside, waiting to be picked up for work, and looked up at the moon.  At that same moment, an object that reflected the moon's light began to move away from the moon.  It was a pinpoint of light to the naked eye, and the further it went away from the moon, the less bright it was.  I was facing south, and it moved easterly away from the moon, at a steady rate.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Slow moving Planet brightness object;2017-01-14 18:55:00;5 minutes;Slow moving Planet brightness object Greensboro, NC,  04/14/17,  8:55 PM.  I went  outside to  put some scraps out  for the  neighborhood night creatures that visit.  When I got in the  middle of  my back yard, I noticed what looked like a planet.  Bright as Jupiter or Mars.  While pondering  which it could be, I noticed it was moving.  No flashing  lights, and it was not in the path I am used to air traffic flying  over.  Airliners that travel over my area are  going on the North to South route at  around 40 thousand ft.  They are much dimmer and move quicker than this  object. Even at that height, the flashing navigation lights are still obvious.  This object may have been a satellite but from my memory of viewing Iridium satellites or the  ISS they moved much faster.  This object was so slow I wasn't sure it was moving at first. It was moving from North West to South East.  I first saw it  directly overhead.  By the time I was sure it really was moving slowly, and not my imagination, I began to be sure this seemed unusual.  When it got to about 45 degrees going South East it quickly faded.  It had been a very consistent brightness until that point.  It had no color or peak of  brightness as it passed over.  It was like Jupiter or Mars, but moving until it faded over a 5 second period.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Fast, silent Mystery Craft.;2019-04-18 10:30:00;1-2 minutes;Fast, silent Mystery Craft. I went for a walk the night I witnessed this- it was the second time I have seen this thing.  It's large. It's SILENT.  And it moves like a greased rocket engine sometimes.  This thing seems to have a table shape to it, or it's a large helicopter shaped thing.  Where there is a red light in the video, the time I saw it before- there was a bright blue light dead center of the dark shape in the middle. There are 4 lights on the...legs.  It gives off the impression of a flying coffee table. Did I mention it is SILENT. I have footage of it (it is crummy, but, it's footage). You can hear the traffic down past the TV tower, you might be able to hear the cessna flying right over my head. You can really hear me snarl at the damn focus.  You'd think something as big as it is, flying at the speed it seems to be going, would make some noise. Nope.  The Cessna droning along was the only noise I heard, and that was weak. It's Unidentified (help!), it's Flying, and it's an Object. I am so on the fence as to what it is, my pants have creases.  If it made noise- helicopter. Both times, with the second time of me being dramatically closer, and no noise. I have very, very good hearing. I listened for all I was worth when I realized how quiet it was- Nada. I think it disturbed the air as it went by. If this is some secret military thing, whoever is flying it should be shot. I'm waiting for one of these hotshots to hit the stupid TV tower. They get THAT CLOSE.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Close encounter/ Abduction in North Carolina bedroom.;2021-08-01 04:00:00;20 minutes;Close encounter/ Abduction in North Carolina bedroom. This is not A UFO sighting. This is an abduction/ physical encounter. On the night of August 1st/ early morning of August 2nd I believe I was visited by extraterrestrial being(s) in my apartment bedroom. I have experienced sleep paralysis numerous times in my life and this was far from it. I slept with my lamp on. I awoke to looking at my lamp in my bedroom which was closest to my bedroom door. I was unable to move and I was able to see white medical tubes all over my body similar to an IV. There were atleast 2 people or entities walking around the left of me out of my view. I felt as if someone took a needle and put it in my arm and gave me something that paralyzed me. But I was awake to the point where I could see and hear my entire bedroom. It also felt as if something was draining blood/ energy from my body and dehydrating me. I moaned and moaned and was unable to turn my head but I was focused on my lamp and I could see and hear people moving in my bedr! oom closest to the wall where I could not turn my head. It was if I was raised or proped up off of the bed because I was able to hear and see my phone ringing. It was my ex girlfriend calling. I started to cry because I felt I was going to be killed or drained completely of blood or whatever was happening to me and that I would not be able to make a phone call or call out for help. I was able to make eye contact with my phone and see that she was calling, it was 4am which is the time that she wakes up and goes to work. I was able to slightly turn my head towards what was moving in my room but not enough but I could still hear my phone ringing and vibrating. I could still see white IV like tubes all over my body and it was painful. I could not stop moaning from the pain but did not have enough strength to scream. I would blink ever so often as it felt like something was physically sucking liquid out of my body through these tubes and I felt the weakest I have ever felt in my! life. I could hear an air sucking noise similar to a tire def! lated in my ear which would last for 3 or 4 seconds at a time. I had decided to try and struggle as much as I could, I felt that I was going to die if I did not get to my phone or call out for help. I was awake as I am now but was physically unable to move and I could feel see and hear everything around me. This lasted close to 15 minutes.I remember not being able to stop moaning from how much pain and dehydration I was feeling. I could still feel rustling and walking all around my bedroom which scared me the most because I could not do anything about it but all I could see was dark shadows on the wall from someone moving in my bedroom but my eyes were still able to see the lamp. I took a deep breath and blinked and all of the tubes were off of my body. I was able to move. I sat up and grabbed my phone and saw that my ex gf called and I decided not to call her back till the morning. I was exhausted my body was dehydrated as if I did not drink water for a week. It hurt. My arm had 2 ! small scab/prick marks as if I was poked with a 2 pronged small needle. I was not nervous or scared anymore. It did not process to me what happened until the next morning when I called my ex gf back and talked about it. I have never experienced anything like this, I do not want an explanation. I just wanted to share an experience which happened to me and I truly believe that I was visited in my apartment bedroom in Greensboro NC. I did not witness any bright lights or see a UFO. I'm typing this on August 13th, and still have the scars and scabs on my arm.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
