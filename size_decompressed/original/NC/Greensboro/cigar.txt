I was sitting on my back porch and saw a grey object over the pine trees west of me. It was not moveing at that time. About two minutes passed and it darted rightback to the left very fast. It went down behind the pines and back up and left a snake like trail. I saw a blue green flash in the center and it split in two objects. Clowds moved in   and I lost the object.

I saw one or two silver, elongated objects moving across the sky and then they just darted away and vanished.;2004-03-14 17:30:00;5-10 minutes;I saw one or two silver, elongated objects moving across the sky and then they just darted away and vanished. I was driving south on Hwy 220 toward Greensboro out of Virgina. It was still daylight. An object appeared in front of me in the distance and was moving in a very fluid manner across the sky. It was silver, elongated and left no fuel trail like a plane. There were two airliners in the air at what seemed to be about the same altitude and they were leaving trails, but the object was not. I kept watching it and then it just seemed to dart straight up and vanish. A few minutes later I saw another object that looked exactly the same. I don't know if it was the same object as before or if it was a second object, but its characteristics were the same as the first. The second object stayed in the sky moving to the west for just a few minutes and then it darted up and away like the first object. It was difficult to tell the altitudes of the objects, but I would say it was between 10,000 - 25,000 feet.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
