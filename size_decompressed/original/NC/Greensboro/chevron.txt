Chevron shaped UFO over skies of Greensboro, NC;2008-06-24 22:00:00;5 seconds;Chevron shaped UFO over skies of Greensboro, NC I was driving home between 10:00pm and 10:30pm last night when I looked up at the sky. I saw a chevron shaped craft streak across the sky in front of me. I had a blue aura or essence about it.  The shape was very distinctive. I only got to see it for a couple of seconds.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

Nearly Invisible Chevron shaped craft silently gliding south with leading edge illuminated by moonlight.;2020-01-05 19:00:00;30-40 seconds;Nearly Invisible Chevron shaped craft silently gliding south with leading edge illuminated by moonlight. I was talking to another Security Guard from a different company about the astronomical objects in the sky. I work Property Security, he works Event Security.  I am an Amatuer Astronomer since the 1990's. We were talking about the night sky and his phone app when I noticed something moving in the sky. I could not tell what it was, in fact I could not see what it was... BUT it was moving. It was the exact color of the night sky.  The light pollution was such that I could not discern stars around the object. The object was gliding at a very smooth, slow, straight, and silent pace.  There were no lights on it at all. It was obvious, this craft did not want to be seen at all.  It was definitely stealth... and most likely cloaked. I pointed up to alert the other Security Guard...  Can you see that? I asked enthusiastically. He noticed it also. We could see something that could not be seen.  What could be seen was a thin chevron shaped cloud illuminated by moonlight along the leading edge of the craft.  The other guard thought looked like a line (180 degrees), whereas I thought it had a slight bend to it similar to a boomerang (Perhaps 170 degrees).  I saw the object for almost 40 seconds before it disappeared into the skyglow of the city south of us, Greensboro. He probably saw it for about 25 seconds. The other Guard stated it best... It had no mass.  We saw it, though it couldn't be seen. I think technically, what we actually saw was the environment being impacted by the objects' presence. The Event being hosted was for World Translators.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
