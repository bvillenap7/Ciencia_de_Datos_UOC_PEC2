Triangular craft with five large round lights on underbelly - silent, slow and low flying;2000-11-22 20:40:00;30 seconds;Triangular craft with five large round lights on underbelly - silent, slow and low flying Large, almost equilateral triangular craft Five very large, round white lights on underbelly in logical formation (one at nose, two under each wing) slow, low and flying in SW direction over Friendly Shopping Center in Greensboro, NC.  No red/green oncoming lights, no white tail light.  No noise whatsoever.  Very low and totally silent.  My description is virtually identical to the 11/29/00 siting in Sherwood, OR.  No strobes or flashes.  I contacted air traffic control - no radar for that part of the town at that low altitude.  Military? How do I connect with readers who may have seen a UFO I (along with 12 others) sited in Yosemite in October of 1982?  It was a blue saucer that cruised in and hoovered on the south side (unfamous side) of Half Dome for an hour then flew off as the same way it cruised in - zig zags and bursts of speed instantaneously.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Faint amber colored, Triangular shaped object with moving spheres within the structure;2001-12-15 19:20:00;5 Minutes;Faint amber colored, Triangular shaped object with moving spheres within the structure Saturday night, my wife and I with a friend went out to eat at the Carrabbas resturaunt in Greensboro, NC.  We had a two hour wait, and we waited outside.  We were sitting on the bench looking out to the north and I noticed a very, faint amber colored triangular shaped object moving to the southeast.  The UFO phenomena has always interested me and I am always looking in the sky, but most of the time I am able to rule out a classic UFO.  99.9% of the time I can identify it, but this time, it was strange.  As it got closer, to overhead, but not completely I noticed that within its triangular structure it appeared to have many spheres or orbs interchanging within it.  The entire craft remained the faint amber color, although the spheres appeared to be more translucent.  My curiousity in the object, attracted a crowd who also were waiting to go inside and they all saw the same thing, including my wife and friend.  One lady even let out a startled yell.  A few gasps were also heard.  Out of the group of us who witnessed the event one lady said that they were just ballons, but the size of the object at that altitude would have meant the balloon cluster would be huge, and it retained a definitive shape, at least the outline did, the rest of the craft did appear to morph somewhat.  We watched it as it went off in the distant night sky toward the southeast, towards Fayetteville, NC.  I'm not sure of the altitude, I approximate it at probably 1000 feet or so.  The first sight of it looked like a jetliner with its lights on coming into land, but shrouded by heavy cloudcover(thats what the shape appeared as intially) It was a clear cold night, only high level cirrus clouds were barely visible.  It was not a helicopter, jet, or hot air balloon or geese.  This was clearly unidentified, in my opinion.  I have also reported this sighting to MUFON.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

The one in the front looked like a arrow it was the biggest it had a white light in the front.   The other two were in the shape of an arrow head they both had red lights on the bottom and they were flashing.  5 minutes after they left airplanes and helicopters filled the sky looking for something.

Black trangular object, silent, slow, and a set of very faint lights around it's perimeter.;2016-02-13 21:00:00;10 seconds;Black trangular object, silent, slow, and a set of very faint lights around it's perimeter. I only saw this for a few seconds, passing over the center of the city, a black triangular shaped craft, lined with lights along what I think was the entire perimeter that were very faint.   Straight line, silent, and it appeared to be low in altitude from my perspective, otherwise it would have been massive in size and traveling very fast if it high altitude.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
