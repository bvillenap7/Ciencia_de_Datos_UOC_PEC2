Orange Object Pursued by Plane in Greensboro, NC 2011;2011-06-13 22:30:00;6 minutes;Orange Object Pursued by Plane in Greensboro, NC  2011 Viewed from second story apt window in downtown Greensboro, NC facing west.  Object was bright orange, and only object in sky.  Object was stationary.   After 5 minutes, another object which appeared to be a plane indicated by two small white lights side by side that would blink simultaneously (I think was also from the west) started getting closer towards the orange object.   As the blinking white lights got close, the orange object started moving east - south-east.  It went over my apt and out of sight.   The plane seemed to be in pursuit but could not match speed.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
9 Orange Globes traveling in a V formation, not sound no blinking lights on a perfectly clear night.;2014-01-04 02:50:00;3 minutes;9 Orange Globes traveling in a V formation, not sound no blinking lights on a perfectly clear night. 1/4/2014 at approximately 02:50. Atleast 9 orange globes flying at a high rate of speed in a V formation flying over Greensboro near Muirs Chapel Rd. and W. Market St.  Objects were traveling southward, towards Wendover Ave. and 40 West.  One of the globes was moving side to side, and forward and backward within the V formation but not travel outside of the interior of the formation.  There was no noise, and no blinking lights.  Color was very similar to sodium vapor street lights.  When I first saw it, the object appeared to have a rigid v shape.  As it aproached I was able to see the object moving within the V formation.  I've lived around Navy, Airforce, and Marine Corps instalations all my life an have never seen anything like it.  The light from the objects was really soft, there was no twinkle.  It was a perfectly clear night without moonlight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Silent, bright white falling comet like object/light. Still then veering to the left.;2014-01-13 18:45:00;3 minutes;Silent, bright white falling comet like object/light. Still then veering to the left. Bright light with light trail following behind.  Thought to be a falling comet, yet it turned after hovering in place for a minute.  Perhaps a plane, but it had no blinking lights and no sound.  Very perplexing.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
