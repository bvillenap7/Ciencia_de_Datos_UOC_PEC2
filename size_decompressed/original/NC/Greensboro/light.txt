Fluorescent orange boomerang shapes.;1972-06-30 21:00:00;5 minutes;Florescent orange boomerang shapes I was just a kid riding in the car with my mom vising family and didn't want to be there so I was ignoring the inside of the car and watching the stars in the county sky.  I remember begin confused then dumbfounded by three seemingly connected but not, florescent orange boomerang shape lights that would flash (seemingly) randomly in the south western sky.  This continued until we were too far and or the tree line blocked my view.   Maybe about 3 mins. or so.   It didn't stop or disappear, so it probably lasted longer.   Wish I had said something now, wish I had gotten Mom to stop the car.   We were in SE Guilford county just off of I-85/I-40 near what is now Lucent Technologies, but at the time was AT&T.  I know I was a kid (around 11 or 12), but I will never forget it and I also have always had a very vivid knowledge of the geography of the Greensboro area so I am 100% on where it was.  I didn't mention it to my Mom at the time because well, like I said, I didn't! want to be there with her anyways so I kept this wild thing to myself.

Very large ball of light. Looked to me as if the sun were moving through town.;1996-12-13 03:00:00;1-minute;Very large ball of light. Looked to me as if the sun were moving through town. I was a security supervisor at a large convention center hotel, while sitting a my patrole van, at approximately 0300 hours I observed a very large, silent ball of light that flew over a large department store and illuminated the whole store and parking lot. The object was flying in a east to west direction towards Piedmont Triad International Airport, and never made a sound. The only thing I can compare it too, is the sun. the object was soo large and bright it looked as though the sun was flying through the sky. The object appeared to fly slowly, although it did not hover. I observed this object for approximately one minute before it blinked out, as if someone cut off a light switch. I am estimating the time of night, and exact date of this incident. The sighting itself is very vivid, however events surrounding it such as time of date, etc are unclear. I have never told this story to anyone beside my wife, who thought I was seeing things, therefore I never bothered to remeber or document important dates and times regarding this incident.

Bright light;2004-04-04 21:00:00;30 seconds;Bright light Looked up to watch airplanes, we are in a major air traffic lane.  Saw a bright object moving slowly southeast.  I've seen many satellites, and this object moved like one except it was at least as bright as Venus.  I have never seen a satellite that bright.  The nearly full moon was in the sky at the time.  The light was bright white much like venus, no yellow tint like an aircraft.  The light was not flashing.  The light also extinguished quickly, usually satellites fade out as they near the horizon.  Maybe it was the space station?;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Space Shuttle presumed sighted  in NC after recent night launch;2006-12-09 20:53:00;About Three Minutes;Space Shuttle presumed sighted  in NC after recent night launch Just mentioning, we know it was the space shuttle, appeasring to pass through Orion. Visible as a steady orange glow, small star-sized, and even saw a white spark jump off in an arched pattern. Maybe a rocket being ejected and burnt?  Question, even though this was a known object, did others see it? Not an impressive sighting, but very interesting and neat. Thanks.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

Light shaped reflective star that moving over the sky in a westerly direction.;2010-01-15 04:00:00;45;Light shaped reflective star that moving over the sky in a westerly direction. The object was a really bright light that looked like a star in the sky but stood out a whole lot. It was not a planet. It was reflecting green and white light and moving very slowly across the sky. It was extremely reflective and I couldnâ€™t ignore it in my peripherals while I was watching television. It was moving in a westerly direction and there was only one of it.

Bright light;2010-09-15 20:10:00;~3 minutes;Bright light Sitting on deck when a light flies in a straight line over the moon.  It was very bright, and appeared to be higher than aircraft, but lower than satellites.  It was a solid very white light, and made no noise.  It flew very close to the moon, but was still the brightest thing in the sky, and it was not fully dark out.  I looked to see if the ISS was due to be here tonight, but it was not.  Maybe it was a satellite, but it was so bright, and appeared to be to low, but that is a judgment call on my part.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

I noticed a green light making movements unlike any airplane. It dropped a considerable distance then made a 90 degree right turn.  It looked like it was getting a better view of the fireworks.  At the finale, it turned from green to bright red, then back to green, and promptly vanished!I tried to videotape it.  Although it's impossible to tell what it is to someone who did not witness it, I know (hope) maybe a professional could glean it's presence.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

(the tree tops) it was very clear and the colors where vivid exactly like Christmas lights.  It was pretty.  The way it was moving was like if your slinging a rope.  The string never broke. It would go fast and then tighten to a short length. When it was going faster it would get a little bit longer. the man from the center said to go back out tomorrow at the same time to see if I see it again.  it was not a ship.  it was a colored string.  I watched it for a solid 15 minutes.  I called the local police to report it.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
