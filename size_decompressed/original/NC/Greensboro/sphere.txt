Observed objects passing along the banks of city reservoir;1982-06-10 21:30:00;10 minutes +/-;Observed objects passing along the banks of city reservoir Back in the early 80's here in Greensboro, I and my dog were traveling home from some friends house in the country and crossed one of the bridges across our lakes north of town. I took a look down the lake to the east towards the marina some 3 miles away. I noticed two lights low in the sky which seem to be moving my direction, so I stopped and parked on the side of the road to watch. My thought was that it was an airplane heading to the airport to the west of my position. But as I watched, the two lights seperated to travel one on each side of the lake, both objects stayed at a very low altitude, possibly less than a 100 feet above the ground. This was really getting interesting. As they got within several hundred yards maybe further, the one on the right shore line moved across the lake to fall in behind the other and they passed my position one following the other, some 200 yard from me. The interesting traites where that these objects made no noise at all and as they passed, the objects stayed a ball of light no matter what angle they were to me, never did there appear to be any frame or structure to them. They may have been the size of possibly a truck tire, it is hard to figure the size and they did not have the halo glow like a street light, I don't recall them eluminating things. I watched as they passed and can't really remember how they left my vision. I had no missing time and have had no later memories of anything else happening other than the wonderful unexplainable sighting. Being a student of metaphysics, my interpertation of what I saw, was that these were energy beings checking on the state of the ecology here. Interesting to this was that a couple of weeks later, riding as a passenger in my sister's car, returning from visiting these friend again, crossing the same point, I looked out across the lake to the west and saw what appeared to be a UFO hovering and at that instance it appeared that a blue beam of light flashed from the object to the ground. Having recently read about abductions and that a lot of the people abducted stated that they were moved from the ground to the ship on a beam of blue light, I would guess an abduction may have been in process. This second encounter now adds the possible purpose of the first sighting as that maybe they were locating this abductee. I was unable to watch the second sighting unfold, being that may sister had no intention of stopping that close to what could be a UFO. I feel extemely fortunate to have had this experience as it has helped to open my mind to the fact that there is more going on around us than we can ever imagine.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
UFO flies over Gas Station;2005-05-02 03:44:00;20 seconds;UFO flies over Gas Station My mother and I, were in the car. It was bright sunny, and cloudy. We stopped to turn into the gas station and while we were stopped we both witnessed what we believe to be a UFO. It floated and moved back and forth in an upward movement. By the time we had pulled in it had dissapered and we lost track of it.  My mom is one of the biggest sceptics out there, so this was really an interesting ordeal for the both of us. There is no way it was a plane, or an animal.  The object was on the smaller size, but very shiney, and obviously made out of metal.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Small metallic orb flying NE at an altitude of several hundred feet.;2009-07-01 18:00:00;a few seconds;Small metallic orb flying NE at an altitude of several hundred feet. I was in my back yard with the dogs when I got home from work.  I looked up at the sky and saw what appeared to be a small metallic sphere traveling from SW to NE.  It certainly didn't seem to be far enough away to be an airplane, and I could see no definitive markings.  It wasn't traveling at a great rate of speed, and seemed pretty ordinary.  I heard no sound and there was no contrail of any sort.  I only saw it for about 10 seconds...from the time it came over the house to when it went over the trees.  I estimate it's altitude to be at least a few hundred feet. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Broad daylight multiple color changing spheres;2010-01-15 10:00:00;20 min;Broad daylight multiple color changing spheres My friend and i were walking down the street to the local store around ten o'clock in the morning. I heard an airplane that was particularly loud, so I looked up. I saw at first what appeared to be a single, sphere shaped craft that looked to be trailing the airplane.  It was silver in color when I first spotted it. As i followed the sphere trailing the airplane, it suddenly stopped. I mean it just stopped moving and was perfectly still. I couldn't believe my eyes.  Suddenly, the sphere began to turn baby blue as if it were reflecting the sky.  It wasn't an immediate change at first, but more like an exotic lizard--it didn't take more than a few seconds. Subsequently, it then changed from blue to the most amazing green that would describe as emerald, then red. When changing colors it gave the appearance that the craft was wobbling as the craft would begin the color change at one end of the sphere and it would make its way to the other side. The best way i c! an describe it alternately is like a modern lighthouse that moves its light beam in a circular motion parallel to the ground, almost like an old fashioned police car siren. I was pretty much just standing in the middle of the street completely mesmerized.  About 2 minutes into this I see another sphere that shot by the stationary sphere at incredible speed. I then moved my focus to the new object. It was identical to the first. In order to keep up with it I was pretty much just spinning in circles. I then see another sphere catch up with the fast moving one (#2). They flew in tandem for a few minutes or so and then suddenly reduced their respective speeds to half that of a conventional aircraft and it was at this point that I noticed the silver appearance began to fade as the crafts began to oscillate and change color, still adhering to their formation. Very spooky. In all I believe that I saw 4-5 spheres--but given their intermittent high speed and hovering behavior, it is hard to say precisely how many there were in the air at that time. Definitely at least 3 as at one point there were 3 craft in my field of vision. The funny thing about all of this is that during this whole experience there were still airplanes that were fl! ying either to or from the airport nearby. The craft just seemed to effortlessly avoid the airplanes and at times they appeared to be chasing them, only to turn around and shoot off in another direction. The whole event lasted approximately 20 minutes as one by one the spheres just seemed to disappear. They didn't fly off into the horizon but just kind of vanished instead. This is the second UFO that I have seen...both sightings within 2 years of each other. Both were here in North Carolina, one in Greensboro and the previous one in Snow Camp, North Carolina which is about a 45 minute drive from Greensboro.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Round object maybe 5 miles away with an altitude about the same as a plane and has been stationary for about 20 min so far.;2010-01-27 02:15:00;20 min;Round object maybe 5 miles away with an altitude about the same as a plane and has been stationary for about 20 min so far. Object randomly appeared around 2:15 AM and has been there ever since.  Def not a star...and ive never seen an aircraft hover that long....and change color.  It seems to change from whiteish blue...to green...to red and back.  Pretty freaky stuff going on right now.  I just stared at it for another few seconds.....definitely a UFO.  I sleep the same way every night and look out the same window....never seen a star.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
UFO over Greensboro, NC 4-27-12 looked like Jupiter but moving very slow all the way across the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS?  PD));2012-04-27 21:40:00;1 to 2 minutes;UFO over Greensboro, NC 4-27-12 looked like Jupiter but moving very slow all the way across the sky and then On Friday April 27, 2012 at 9:40 pm my girlfriend and I got of our motorcycles to take a break.  We pulled into the parking lot of Jake’s Diner on New Garden rd in Greensboro, NC.  As soon as I took off my helmet and sat down I looked up and said, “There is an UFO”!!  It looked just like Jupiter maybe a hair smaller but just as bright.  It was moving very, very slow across the sky no blinking lights.  I started to video tape it and my girlfriend was giving me a hard time saying it is not a UFO so I only captured some of it going across the sky.  Sure as shit when I quit recording, the light was just past half way across the very clear night sky then all of a sudden it turned red and a little fuzzy and cut an angle straight up away from us like it was going into space and disappeared in 2 seconds. I do have the video of it before it took off into space!!  Nothing nowhere, no lights could be seen it was gone.  She looked at me and said, “I guess you were right! ” WOW! That was the second time I have ever seen one. The first time about 13 years ago was very close and much more in our face with a military helicopter chasing it just 100 feet over our heads. That was a very cool sighting!!!  Living out by Belews lake near the Duke Power station a bright orange sphere the size of a large Bradford pear tree flew a 100 feet over our house.  A week before in the middle of the night I was woken by a helicopter buzzing our roof.  A week later around 8:00pm I heard that same helicopter so I told my wife quick I hear that helicopter let’s see it.  We ran outside and leaned against the deck and watched over our roof line waiting to see this loud helicopter.  It was getting louder and louder then we saw a large glowing orange sphere it was very peaceful not a sound when we saw it you could not even hear it moving in the air above us and it was only a 100 feet.  It moved like mercury very fluid then it went over the trees. Then we saw the military copte! r and it was as loud as can be.  We even saw the pilot look down at us with in a black visor helmet.  It was the type like Blue Thunder back in the day with the gun turret and small wings on the side.  They were flying straight towards the power station!  That was cool!!;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Orange sphere seen near PTI airport;2012-06-10 00:30:00;3 minutes;Orange sphere seen near PTI airport My wife and I took our dog out around 12:30 Sunday morning.   Against a cloudless sky an orange glow in the distance caught our attention.  Living less than a mile from PTI airport I first thought it was a plane with an engine on fire.  It was low in the sky like a plane that was going to land in a mile or less,and seem to be traveling about the same speed as a plane.  We had around a 45 degree angle of site at it's closest point to us.   Object was fire orange and seemed to have an aura,object was sphere shaped.  This object made no sound as it passed over the woods behind us.  This is when we lost site if it.   This was the first time either of us have seen anything like this.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

UFO meanders through the morning sky followed by a military plane.;2015-07-15 07:15:00;10 minutes;UFO meanders through the morning sky followed by a military plane. I was outside on my deck this morning and observed a craft approaching from the west, high altitude.  A plane going in the opposite direction gave me some perspective on the craft's speed.  It was traveling very slowly, and did not travel in a straight line, but rather seemed to meander.  It came into my view traveling due East, then as I watched changes to SE and then changed to NE and traveled over my house and out of view.  About 3 or 4 minutes later a military plane flying fairly low passed over going NW.  The craft I saw appeared to be spherical.  There was no sound or vapor trail.  Maybe it was a drone?  But how high do drones fly?  And is it a coincidence that a military plane appeared a few minutes later headed in the general direction I saw the craft headed?;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
