U.F.O. seen over Greensboro, N.C. , unbelievable sighting of a Bright glowing object in the sky.;1994-12-12 23:00:00;5 Minutes;U.F.O. seen over Greensboro, N.C. , unbelievable sighting of a Bright glowing object in the sky. Myself and my friend were sneaking out when we were teenagers I'm now 29.  We were meeting 2 girls in my neighborhood and were going to walk up to the local Circle K convenient store.  Well, we met up with the girls halfway, and started walking up to the store.  The neighborhood was a very large suburban neighborhood outside of Greensboro, N.C. close to the Piedmont International airport.  I can remember the night there so vividly, the cars had frost on them that would glisten under the street lights. It was such a cold night, but we were having fun sneeking out walking up to the store, we were about 14 yrs of age.  On our way to the store we were all cutting up having a good time when my buddy who was a jokster to say the least, all of a sudden said ya'll theres a U.F.O..  My initial thought was he is such an idiot, until I looked up and couldn't believe my eyes, their in the dark sky a little above the trees was a huge Bright yellowish oval object slowly careening above the trees.  We all in utter disbelief stood there and gazed at it.  Like I said, it was oval in shape sort of like a football stretched a little.  It Was completely glowing a very illuminated yellowish color, with a little blinking light at the front of the U.F.O. according to the direction of movement. Itwas approximately a quarter mile above the ground about a half of mile from wher we were at.  Without saying a word we all started running toward the object, but all of a sudden it simply vanished leaving puffy pink trails only to be seenin the city and moon lights.  So, with exubilation walked to the store and met w/ a friend who had a driver license and car and he picked us up to go riding.  We began to tell him of what we witnessed, and he sort of just laughed it off until he turned on his radio and radio DJ announced that a bunch of drunks on a Saturday night were calling in reported U.F.O. sightings, but we knew better because we were not drunk and definetaly not crazy. Our friend believed us after he heard the ra! dio DJ. Oh yea, forgot the object was also moving extremely slow and made no noise.  That is what I remember like it was yesterday.  Thank you for reading my story and keeping an open mind.  I could't tell you what we saw that winter night many years ago, but I would sure like to know.  I bet the Government knows.  Thank-You.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

oval shaped object flying overhead far faster than any airplane;2009-05-27 08:25:00;20 seconds;oval shaped object flying overhead far faster than any airplane I did not know where to post this when I saw it, but I was on Grimsley High campus and looked up to see what appeared to be a bright oval traveling overhead, going far faster than anything i've ever seen. It glinted in the sun and traveled across the sky until it could no longer be seen (all in a matter of seconds);36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
15 reddish/orange orbs launching from the horizon line and traveling slowly before fading away.;2011-11-11 18:05:00;5 minutes;15 reddish/orange orbs launching from the horizon line and traveling slowly before fading away. I went out to my front porch, which faces in a northeast direction.  Not being very good with direction, I can just say as I was facing the sky, the full moon was just starting to be visible among the tree tops, to the left.  I saw four pulsating orbs (reddish-orange in color) -- for lack of a better word -- in a rectangular formation, quite spread out.   They were moving very slowly from right to left and faded away as they got to the point where the moon was just becoming visible (about 6:05 p.m.)  As I continued watching, one-by-one orbs were launching from the same point at the horizon line and traveling, again, from right to left.   At this point, none of them were in a formation, but just kind of slowly traveled until they faded away.  I would guess there were about 15 of them.  Luckily, I was able to get my neighbor to come out and she observed the same thing (with the exception of the first rectangular formation).  I would guess the whole episode lasted appr! oximately 5-10 minutes. I am a 54-yr-old woman with a steady job, very educated and intelligent.  My neighbor is a woman in her 60's -- also intelligent.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
After today I know for a fact we are not alone!;2014-10-09 06:00:00;2 minutes;After today I know for a fact we are not alone! I was dropping my mother off at work.  On the way back home I noticed a oval ball of light the color of fire just hovering in front of my car.  It was moving as if it was driving in traffic,except it was floating.  Im blinking my eyes thinking I'm seeing spot or something.  Until the car in lane beside me looks at me,and points at the light as if he is saying are you seeing this to.  It them merged to the right,and floated through the trees.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Oval shaped glowing white object leaves a trail of 'smoke' in the sky then vanishes .;2019-12-20 06:45:00;3mins;Oval shaped glowing white object leaves a trail of 'smoke' in the sky then vanishes . I observed one oval shaped craft heading easterly in the sky. At first it appeared to be a jet of some sort but it was moving sporadically in the sky in a continued forward motion (up and down). It let behind a trail of ‘smoke’. At this point I was thinking it was some sort of meteorite or maybe a fireball. The color was white. As soon as I came to this conclusion is when the object stopped in the sky and it appeared to have some sort of white haze, almost like a fog develop around it. As soon as this happened the trail of ‘smoke’ ceased to be produced. The object grew brighter and moved ahead then absolutely just vanished. I was able to record about 2 ½ minutes from my cell phone. The initial event that caught my attention was not recorded because I was really dumbfounded by what I was looking at in the sky. As soon as the object started to disappear is when I started recording so the video only shows the faint object and the trail of ‘smoke’ which shows the trajectory of the objects movement. I took one still shot when I arrived to work that only showed what was left over from the ‘smoke’ the object produced. It was oval in shape and had a bright white glow. I could see no details other than the shape and the glow. Its shape was very distinct and it did not have wings from what I could tell. No blinking lights or anything of the sort that would make it identifiable as a jet or a helicopter. The sky was clear and it was in fact dark just before sunrise. I will email the photo and video evidence.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
