Big brilliant white fireball, size of full moon with long white tail falling from overhead to the South of Greensboro, NC;2003-10-20 20:50:00;15 seconds;Big brilliant white fireball, size of full moon with long white tail falling from overhead to the South of Greensboro, NC I was sitting at the computer which is in our back room facing west.  There are large windows and a large glass patio door on the west wall of this room.  I looked up from the computer to my left and out the patio door--- I saw a large brilliant white fireball approximately the size of a full moon (if the moon was directly over head), and upon its appearance, it descended south with a brilliant trail also white and long following, it appeared that it may have fallen to the ground south of here.  It was stunning.  Probably a meteor or space debris, but I wonder if anyone else in the Greensboro area noticed it. Pretty big for a meteor. Did anyone else see this?;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Large flickering light rising slowly in sky.;2009-04-04 23:30:00;Unknown;Large flickering light rising slowly in sky. I live at college right now, and as I left my dorm for an evening snack, to be found in a different building, I saw a large, flickering light. (By 'large' I mean 'too large to be a star'.) The light was round and approximately 4-5mm in dia. Keep in mind that my dorm is roughly rectangular, three stories tall, and has a courtyard in the middle. All dorm rooms open towards the courtyard. So as I exited my room, the light was just above the line of the roof. My best guess as to cardinal direction would be West-Northwest, but do NOT treat that as anything but a guess. I can tell you that I could see the moon clearly from where I was standing, and that the light was below and to the right of the moon considerably. The light was moving slowly, but visibly, upwards. I would say it moved about 1mm up (to my eyes) every second or so again, a guess -- I have a poor sense of distance. It kept changing color as well, and very rapidly at that -- at most, it stayed one color for 1/4 second, probably more like half that. Distinct colors were blue, white, and red, in that order. Very hazy, too -- its boundaries were blurry. About 1-1.5mm of its diameter was blurred. That's all I've got.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

Nothing like any light I had ever seen.  It was not very high like a jet or plane.  I watched it for a few minutes and then it just flew away.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

Picking fiance from work, we head back over afterwards.  After a few drinks we decided to go outside for a cigarette.   As my fiance and friend face me, a huge ball orb, lit up like I have never seen before.  I have seen A lot this was no comet just like  sighting I had before in forest oaks.  But this was downtown Greensboro.  Could barely see stars maybe few fingers full.  No one saw it at all.  I've seen and studied ufology, etc., since I was 16 years old.  I know what I saw.  Brightest light blue orb or ship idk.  But I bet I could have drive 115 miles and found that ufo.  Chose to stay drink.
