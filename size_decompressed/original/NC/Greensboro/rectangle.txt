Rectangular Objects Spotted in Daylight in Greensboro, NC.;2016-06-18 09:00:00;10 minutes;Rectangular Objects Spotted in daylight in Greensboro, NC. My son and I were walking at a local park.  It was sunny and the sky was cloudless.  As we were walking we looked up and saw two reflective rectangular objects at a very high altitude.   These objects were not floating like air balloons, nor were they flying like planes.  They did not leave any vapor trails.  They were moving pretty fast and simply moved behind the trees out of our field of vision.   As we kept walking, and got back to another clearing, we saw two more of the same type of objects and behind them were three small airplanes flying in formation appearing to be in pursuit.  The planes were unmarked.  My son seemed to think they were military.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
