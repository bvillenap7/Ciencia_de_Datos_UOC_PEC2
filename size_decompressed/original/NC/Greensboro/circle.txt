Then within about a time span of about 15 mins numerous other crafts appeared to be going in every different direction, they were circular in shape and yellow in color.  It looked exactly like the ufo's from the some of the NASA film on youtube. Very erie. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

A circular object, shining red and white lights in the grey night, was hovering just above the tree line.;2014-03-23 06:00:00;1-3 minutes;A circular object, shining red and white lights in the grey night, was hovering just above the tree line. 	The craft was circular, and appeared to almost be flat.  It showed red and white lights, and spun very quickly.   It seemed to slowly bob up and down, but in a more controlled manner, like it required much more force.   It was just above a tree line, but since the sun hadn't risen yet, therefore I was unable to observe the exact color of the craft.   There was only one craft, but judging from proportion, it was adequately large.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

Circular shape with purple hued, triangular blinking light.;2018-10-10 21:23:00;00:08:00;Circular shape with purple hued, triangular blinking light A huge circle was present in the sky with a triangular blinking light.  The light was smooth in fading and reappearing with about two seconds in between blinking on and blinking off.  The light was close to a purple hue.   I walked about a mile and the UFO was present the entire time.  The shape was a bit hard to make out because it was a break in the clouds, but the ship was low enough in the sky to make out the circular shape.  The blinking light was perfectly visible.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

Cluster of potential UFOs;2021-08-22 15:45:00;30 minutes;Cluster of potential UFOs In the middle of the day (sparse cloud coverage but otherwise bright, blue sky) my friend and I were down at the park near my house and we were just looking at the clouds and we see this collection of about 8/9 tiny dots in the sky.  They were too small to capture on camera and we didn’t have a telescope or binoculars.  They were above cloud level and sort of bright/reflective and a couple seemed to have red lights on the bottom.  There were two more close by but not part of the cluster.  As we watched them the would move closer together and then spread out again and at one point formed a triangle formation (like birds or airplanes might).  They eventually moved out of sight behind the clouds and we didn’t see them any more.  The whole event lasted about 30 minutes.  Afterwards we saw a couple planes fly past that were much, much closer to earth.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
