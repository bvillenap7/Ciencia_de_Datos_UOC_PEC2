It was just after dark in mid-June 1972.  I was 20 years old at the time, home for summer after my sophomore year at UNC-CH. Considering the time period, it is important to note that I did not use drugs and drank very rarely.   We lived in the semi-country, about 1.5 miles from the Greensboro Airport.   I had just walked into the edge of the woods  to burn our trash in the burn-barrel.  As I came out of the woods, I saw a disk with a diameter of about 20 feet silently rotating just off my right side.  It was 30 to 40 feet off the ground and had alternating flat red and white lighted panels around its sides.  I stood there literally frozen for at least a minute watching the red and white lights as they slowly and silently rotated.  My German Shepherd sat down transfixed.  When I had the wherewithal to return to the house, I had to call him several times to come with me.  I went inside to call my father (no one was at home at the time), and my dog remained on the back porch steps, still transfixed.  Several minutes later when I went back outside, the disk had disappeared.  My dog, an excellent watchdog, never barked once. I can still vividly recall that night.  There is no doubt in my mind what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have arbitrarily assigned a date.  PD));36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

When I opened the Storm door I looked up and saw a large disc shaped object with a dome on top and a triangular bottom, about fifty feet above the tree tops, which are about fifty feet tall. It was moving very slowly in a steady South South West direction.  There were no lights on but I could see it against the skyline. What stood out to me was the sound!! It was very deep steady, powerful propulsion system sound.  The feeling the sound left with me was that it was very, very powerful and under no stress.  I've been around powerful diesel propulsion systems and none of them were that powerful.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

We were watching one plane flying east and one plane flying west and remarking how much the speed was affected. I live north of the PTI airport and glanced in that direction. There was a extremely bright disc shaped object in the sky over the airport at a high altitude. It seemed to be higher than the planes were flying. I got my girlfriends attention and pointed out the object. the only thing to compare it to was how Venus has appeared recently in the nighttime sky. She thought it must be a star and I myself remarked that it could possibly be Venus. As we watched the object appeared to be getting closer. At the time there were at least six airplanes visible in the sky and each one was leaving a vapor trail behind it. This object was leaving no trail and appeared to be coming straight down vertically and not horizontally like the airplanes. The object suddenly seemed to shift direction and begin to move straight up into the sky. It was getting smaller but was still incredibly bright. A small cloud passed in front of the object but the object was still clearly visible through the cloud when suddenly it just blinked out. When the cloud passed nothing was there anymore leaving us at a loss for what it could have been. The cloud was small and there was no way it could have gone in any direction but straight up without us seeing where it went.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

Saw 3 hovering orange, fuzzy glowing objects with no definition except when leaving.  One appeared disk shape.;2010-01-21 01:00:00;30 seconds;Saw 3 hovering orange, fuzzy glowing objects with no definition except when leaving.  One appeared disk shape. January 21, 2019, Approx: 00:45 AM - 01:10 AM Greensboro, North Carolina Guilford County   During the duration of my viewing of the eclipse, I was glancing at the star clusters near Orion’s Belt.  I was looking back and forth from the moon to Orion’s Belt, numerously throughout that night.  After a while, all of a sudden, I witnessed three orange, hazy, glowing illuminations (ufo’s?) near Orion’s Belt.  I refer to them as illuminations because at first they had no defined shape, other than being three small, out of the ordinary, orange glowing shapes in the night’s sky.  It almost seemed like they flew towards me from the constellation Orion because the illuminations got larger and seemed to get closer.  They weren’t hovering directly overhead, but were hovering in the distance.  I’m not exactly sure how close or far they we’re from me.  I guess if you held a ruler up to the sky in front of you and measured the size of the object I would estimate it to be 7-8mm.  There were no small or flashing lights on them.  They slowly traveled together, horizontally, kind of side by si! de, but not ridged or in any defined formation.  They seemed to fly somewhat wobbly or unstable and with a slight bobbing motion.  One of the illuminations/ufo’s suddenly veered left from the other two, somewhat erratically.  Almost like something was wrong. It then began to fade in and out, leaving an orange trail, then disappeared completely.  The other two remained solid and did not fade in or out.  A few seconds later the other two flew upward then vanished.  I would say my experience lasted for approximately 30 seconds. As they got farther away I could make out one faintly shaped saucer.  The sides were tapered and gradient with a contoured top and bottom. When this occurred I was alone, outside in my crystal/meditation garden, putting out all of my indoor crystals to be charged and cleansed by the super blood wolf moon and total eclipse.  My crystal garden is comprised of three 3’ amethyst geodes and three large 1’ quartz crystals positioned triangularly and in an equilateral formation.  Basically like an invisible hexagram.  In the center of the hexagram is a birdbath with a 12” quartz crystal that I often refer to as my receptor.  Surrounding the receptor are various gemstones and crystals.  The crystal garden has natural indigenous quartz stones surrounding it, as well in many other parts of my yard.  I feel it to be a powerful point of energy, both physically and spiritually. Also, for the past year or so I’ve been instinctively drawn to that constellation.  Practically 90% of the time when I look up to the night sky I immediately see Orion’s Belt.  I don’t have to search for it.  It’s always right there!  Also, when I meditate or simply look at the stars, I’ll talk to any light beings, whoever or whatever may be out there.  My spiritually is greatly influenced by metaphysical, esoteric, and humanistic/pagan philosophies.  Dr. Steven Greer’s and other ufo researchers have also been, to say the least, eye openers to me. I’m a 51 yr. old white male, self employed retailer and truth seeker. This my truth and hear-by swear upon everything I hold sacred that what I witnessed is true. With all due sincerity,  William P.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
There were 5 bright lights and it was not making any noise like a plane does.;2010-07-05 23:00:00;15 seconds;There were 5 bright lights and it was not making any noise like a plane does. I walked out onto my back porch, and I looked North and I saw a round object with 5 very bright lights, in a T shape, flying South.  It flew over trees, then all of a sudden it seemed to look like it broke apart and disappeared.  The reason I know it was not an airplane is because there were not red blinking lights, and there were more bright lights present on the object than on a plane.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

I also so aircraft every all over as if they were looking for something.   So I took out my camera and filmed and took shots.  Later as I reviewed the photos and zoomed in I was able to see the detail of a hunched over clear figure landing a disk shaped figure.  Relative to the size of a full moon this figure appeared 4 times larger as it got closer to the surface of land.  While in the sky compared to a full size moon it was smaller than the moon and appeared to be only as 1/32 the size of the moon.  Also smaller black Dracula drooping looking figures flew across the moon and were smaller than the moon.  The crafts sort of moved like a bumble bee or a fly.  Many planes and jets were in the sky.  Smaller tear drop light figures also began appearing in the sky in a very calm smoothing upward progression.  The sky was very active.
