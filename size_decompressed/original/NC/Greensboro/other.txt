White discs converging into one and changing shapes, disappearing, then reappearing separated.;2017-01-26 12:40:00;35 minutes;White discs converging into one and changing shapes, disappearing , then reappearing seprated. A co-worker and I were sitting in my car at lunch (12:30 PM EST).  Off to the southeastern part of sky, we notice bright white dots or discs. Converging together.  Separating, then disappearing.  It look like a white webbing that constantly changed shape. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness has forwarded a high-qality video, which indicates a white clump, moving across a clear blue sky.  We will post the video, at a later date.  PD));36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Lights different directions that changed color.;2017-10-15 23:18:00;6-10 seconds;Lights different directions that changed color, I was driving towards town from the Kivett/Old Randelman area and first I saw a yellow/orange light that went across the sky from right to left but I was sure it wasn't a shooting star because of the speed and the fact that it almost looked like it appeared from a different dimension and disappeared within 4 seconds.   Within a minute I was still driving in the same directions and I actually slowed down to keep focus on the road and sky back and forth and sure enough another light came to my sight, except this time it came from top to bottom and it was white for about 80% of the time, then as it looked like it got close to crashing or hitting ground, it turned into a few different hues of green and then yellow/white and it looked like it dissipated or hit water because there was no explosion or light where I expected to see it light up.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433

Strange craft on approach with improper NAV lights that disappeared in class B airspace;2018-11-08 18:30:00;2 minutes;Strange craft on approach with improper NAV lights that disappeared in class B airspace In November 2018 about 6:30 at night I witnessed a craft on approach into GSO airport RW 32 on my way home from work on the 840 loop exit off of I40.  The craft caught my attention because of the lack of navigation lights in class B airspace.  The only lights visible were two red lights one on top of the other.  The craft flew over my head as I was driving.  I rolled down my window and I heard no sound.  The craft was about 300 feet above and as it was moving it would reflect as if light was being shined on the bottom portion but it was a pattern.   It did seem to have wings but the under fuselage seemed to be almost invisible except for the strange reflection.  I kept driving and looking for it to land but it veered off over West Market Street and disappeared.  I immediately called the Tower to ask what the craft was and the staff member I spoke with said they had just changed shifts and he had no knowledge that a landing happened.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
Saw exact same strange craft again a week later at the same spot.  It was on approach to GSO RW 32;2018-11-15 18:00:00;2 minutes;Saw exact same strange craft again a week later at the same spot.  It was on approach to GSO RW 32 On November 2018 I witnessed the second observation of a craft on approach to GSO/ RW 32 exactly a week later.  I was on the off ramp getting onto I-840 and with disbelief I saw the same craft.  The Craft had a white and Red Identification this time with no blinking NAV lights that should be required in class B airspace.  It went over my car at basically the exact spot I had witness the first encounter.  It had an invisible Fuselage that would reflect light in a strange pattern.  I was the only car on the highway so my lights couldn’t have had that reaction to it.  It was about 300 feet again over my car and I stopped to see the craft.  This time it turned on 3 white lights across the middle and winged section in a horizontal pattern.  They were not bright enough to be landing lights and they were facing the wrong diction for landing.  The craft turned to what appeared to be 45 degree angle just feet from landing and then disappeared.  I called the tower and! again and of course… no knowledge of a landing.  I told him about another time that I called in to report the same craft and he told me it could have been an airplane that had NAV light problems.   Well, I know I witnessed the same craft exactly one week apart at the same moment and that explanation doesn’t work.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
