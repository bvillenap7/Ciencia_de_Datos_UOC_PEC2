It had 4 whitish/yellow lights on the bottom, which flashed in sequence, front then back. I couldn't judge the height, but it was large enough to see very clearly, and it passed through some clouds and could still be made out. It made no sound what so ever. There was an  aircraft off in the distance that could be seen and heard. This object was directly overhead. The time of the flight occurance was about 30 sec. The object came through the clouds flying west to east, broke through the clouds, and then disapeared. Once again it made no sound and had no flashing marker lights like a normal aircraft would have. What lights that were on it were much larger and did not flash on a timed interval.;36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
