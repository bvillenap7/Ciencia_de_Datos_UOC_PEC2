It was a blue egg shape object, about the size of a helicopter hovering about 500 feet above me.   And as soon as I saw it, it shot across the sky leaving a blue trail streak.  It probably went about the length of a football field in about 2 second then disappear. I have never seen anything like it in my life.  I did not hear any sound coming from it either, even as it shot across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD));36.0869522009781;-79.8310931747433
