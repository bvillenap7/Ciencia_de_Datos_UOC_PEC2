Moving bright light over Maysville;2009-02-06 21:00:00;1 min +;Moving bright light over Maysville We were driving home from the local store and noticed a bright star like object tracking with us to the south. I was just on aircrew duty here(usmc) and know the lights and speed of military aircraft here. It was distant IMO at first but it could be deceiving at night. As we pulled into the driveway it was south over the house and was over as we pulled in. I went back to the same place as we pulled in and it had moved to a stationary point behind us and is still there(so it was or had moved). I know how stars move as our position does but this was obviously different. And all the aircraft we have here doesn’t have or put off light like that. I work on AV-8B’s here so I know what I’m talking about. I can’t say what it was or is as it is still there and this will have to be backed up by others. Star like lights don’t move like this. I hope this can be put together with more information.;34.8663;-77.2347
