I was driving north on Bynum Avenue in Maysville, NC to one my friend's house.There were two other guys with me. Bynum is a small rural residential road, only about 1 mile long.  We noticed what at first looked like a semi truck facing us on the road near the intersection of Bynum and First Street.  My friend's house sits about 500 feet from the intersection, left of North Bynum.  Just before we arrived, my friend in the front leaned up and asked, What is that!? We all looked and saw at least 4 bright circular lights, which faced South. The object looked like it had a shape like a greyhound bus. The lights had a yellowish tint and were about 20 feet off the ground. I pulled into the yard, our line of sight with the object was obstructed for just moments by a large  line of bushes which sit along the bank of the ditch.  We all walked to the street to see it up close, but the object was gone.  Neither of us heard any sounds. If were the lights were at was in! deed the front, then it would have had to turn around.  The object never passed behind us. In the yard you can see Bynum, first, second, and mattocks streets.  No vehicle traveled down either street. We still talk about that today.  I have always been hesitant to report it, but after watching a few documentaries about the topic, I was compelled.  I often wonder if we were abducted and placed back in the car or yard..;34.8663;-77.2347
