UFO over Charlotte-Douglas Airport Sunday 5/5/19.;2019-05-05 01:00:00;5 seconds;UFO over Charlotte-Douglas Airport Sunday 5/5/19. I live about 15 minutes from Charlotte Douglas Airport.  I’ve been observing airplanes land from my front porch for several years.  I know what the normal speed of an airplane is.  Very early Sunday, my girlfriend & I were sitting on the front porch.  I had ben watching planes over the horizon, coming in steadily one after another.  A bright light appeared in the same approach pattern as the airplanes.  Its light was much more brilliant than any of the airplanes I have seen.  It took the same approach line, but moving at a pace I would think near Mach I.  I’m not 100% sure that the lights were blinking because there was some low cloud cover, but only in random spots in the sky.  I really believe the light was blinking in what seemed to be a random order.  It followed what appeared to be the exact same landing pattern the airplanes take, then it made an IMMEDIATE turn up at an approximate 60* angle and disappeared immediately afterwords.;35.2631;-81.0942
