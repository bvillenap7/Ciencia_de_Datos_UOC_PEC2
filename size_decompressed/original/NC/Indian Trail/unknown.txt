I'm wasn't really thinking this was a UFO, but I saw a report that people saw a UFO in Durham North Carolina around the same time.  It could have been around 20:40-20:50 PM.  I would place it around the same time as the other sighting though, which was at or around 8:45. I'm not really sure because I was standing around talking for a while before it took place.  The reason I'm filing a report is because I've never seen anything like it, and it happened almost at the exact same time.  So we were standing in a very well lit parking lot right under a light poll.  We noticed a huge flash which was like a lightning flash.  When I think about it, it was more white than blue like lightning.  I looked up immediately and saw a small orange/red tail die out almost like a little Roman candle.  I was pretty sure it was a shooting star, but all the other reports have me wondering.  I didn't hear it, but I was talking.  My friend and the guy I was talking to were like wow did you see the lightning, but I was the only one that saw the tail of whatever it was burning out.  I knew it couldn't be lightning not just because of the tail but because there wasn't a cloud in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  The year of the sighting is 2003.  Many other sightings reported from the east coast.  We believe the most likely explanation for the event is a meteor.  PD));35.0836999999997;-80.6645999999995
2 odd acting circle ufos almost searching in sky for something or someone.;2016-08-12 03:00:00;2 hours;2 odd acting circle ufos almost searching in sky for something or someone. My mother and I were watching the meteor shower, then saw this light that was acting strange.  Wasn't a plane because it was moving in all directions very slowly.   There was so clouds and if you looked real close you could see a spotlight on the clouds. Both would rise, go down and side to side.   No noise was present.  They almost seem to be searching.  Sun started coming up and they shot away like a bullet from a gun.  Couldn't tell the shape.  I've seen 2 ufos before but didn't act this strange.;35.0836999999997;-80.6645999999995
