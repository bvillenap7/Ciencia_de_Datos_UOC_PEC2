Low Flying Object seen flying over my backyard at low speed.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-01 20:30:00;5-10 sec;Low Flying Object seen flying over my backyard at low speed. I was in my backyard with my dog and looking at the night sky.  I could hear the high altitude planes flying overhead.  The sky was dark, clear with a few clouds.  A dark color, cone shaped object flew over my house, over my back yard and over the tree line at slow speed.  The object disappeared over the tree line.  The direction of travel was approximately SE to NW.  The object was completely silent and there were no lights.  I don’t know if cone shape is the right description but it was like a very narrow triangle or very long spear shape.  The object was as long as a commercial airliner and in my estimation it was flying at about 3,000 to 5,000 feet above ground level.  We have a large airport about 20-25 miles away and a small commercial airport about 2 miles from our house.  The object flew lower than any aircraft I usually see flying around my house.  I don’t ever recall seeing any night flying in and out of the small airport that is near our house. I served over 20 years in the military and been around many aircraft at night.  I also served over 19 years as a police officer and worked near the major airport in Charlotte.  I have never seen anything that looked like this and flew as slow as it did without making a sound.
