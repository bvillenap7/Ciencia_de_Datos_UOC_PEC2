5 cigar shaped craft at high altitude.;2015-07-16 17:00:00;2 minutes;5 cigar shaped craft at high altitude . I was feeding my horse and I noticed a long cigar snapped object moving at high altitude.  About the time I noticed it I saw two more behind it.  These initial 3 were moving relatively fast and were out I my sight in less than a minute. I looked to the left and saw two more craft the same size moving the same speed also at high altitude.one was below the other and I actually got a video of it on my iPhone. It was hard to film because it was daylight and the craft were very far away. I noticed there was no sound from any of these craft and it was unlike the object I saw in 2014 with flashing lights at high altitude .;35.0836999999997;-80.6645999999995
