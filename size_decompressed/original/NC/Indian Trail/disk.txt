My mother was in the front, driving, I was in the passenger seat, and my sister was in the back.  We saw two light moving into each other, going to crash! We looked away for ONLY one second, and back, and only one sat in the air. It scared the crap out of us! We were really scared. We thought, at first, it was only planes, about to crash!  But that one sat with red gleaming lights, and scared us. It glided back and forth, and would stop. I have it on my camera phone video!;35.0836999999997;-80.6645999999995
