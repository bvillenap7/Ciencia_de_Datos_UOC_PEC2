Upon the passing of the moon the object vanished as the edges of the two orbs passed one another.   I have photographic evidence of the sighting which I posted on on Facebook to find if anyone else may have witnessed the anomaly that I viewed.   No reports of the phenomenon have been obtained, but perhaps there are some I am unaware of to this point. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
