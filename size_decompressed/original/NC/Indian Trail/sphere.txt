Eleven burning  orange craft seen over Indian Trail North Carolina August 3, 2013;2013-08-03 21:40:00;5 minutes;Eleven burning  orange craft seen over Indian Trail North Carolina August 3, 2013 Saturday August 3, 2013, Indian Trail North Carolina.  My two daughters, 11 and 12, and one of their school friends and I were returning home from the movies Saturday evening at 9:40pm.  We were ¼ mile from home traveling west when I observed four orange lights in the sky as I looked through the trees and while rounding a turn.  As I drove through the turn I immediately pulled the car off the road, turned on the hazard lights and asked the children to start filming what I saw in the sky.  All objects were approximately three thousand feet up, made absolutely no sound and much larger than any distant star.  If you held a pencil out in front of you they would be the same size as the eraser on the end. The first 4 objects were heading from SW to NE all along the same bearing.  Together they reminded me of the handle of the big dipper, referring to the formation they were in.  They, as well as the follow on groups of objects, were orange in color, almost looking as if it was a burning orange.  As the first four craft crossed my bearing, as I looked into the sky, one by one the orange craft “flickered” in color and vanished.  They all vanished at the same point in space.  It was this time that the children and I who had called family members to report what we were seeing noticed that the phone calls dropped repeatedly. The next 5 objects were in a “V” formation with one single object out front followed by two and then again followed by two more.  Once again they were burning orange in color and traveled in the same direction as the first four.  At the same point in the sky the objects flickered and disappeared from sight. The last two objects were in succession, one behind the other, and behaved as the others. Once home I called 911 and reported our sightings.  My daughter recorded 3.5 minutes of video which doesn’t do justice to what we saw but does capture the experience.

Observed a very bright light changing colors and blinking on and off in the sky.;2014-12-01 18:20:00;5 seconds;While observing a very bright light changing colors and blinking on and off in the sky, my son went to his bedroom.   As i looked back up in the sky, an object flew past overhead.  At first I thought it was a shooting star because of the speed but the colors changed from red to yellow or amber.  I have never seen anything move that fast in my life.  Although I should have been able to watch it for a while longer it seemed to simply disappear in front of me.   Not sure what it was but it was definitely different. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.0836999999997;-80.6645999999995
