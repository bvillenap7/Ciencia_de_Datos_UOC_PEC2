a bright red light seen to grow in size and intensity, then vanish.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Iridium satellite flare??  PD));2007-11-09 18:30:00;about 2 seconds;a bright red light seen to grow in size and intensity, then vanish. I'm a pizza delivery driver.   Earlier in the day (about 6-ish) I saw a bright red light, that looked about the size of mars (seen from earth), but it was sleightly brighter, and thought it was mars.   Later, about 6:30, I was driving southish, and I saw the same thing, only this time, it was brighter.   After two or so seconds, the light grew brighter, and expanded in size to about 1/2 inch at arms length.  Then it quickly dimmed, and dissapeared.   I could see no plane lights in that area after the sighting.  I'm no astronomer, but I always watch the stars. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Iridium satellite flare??

Bright Electric Blue Light over Indian Trail, North Carolina.;2013-11-19 19:30:00;2 minutes;Bright Electric Blue Light over Indian Trail, North Carolina My family went outside our home looking north to see the launching of 29 satellites from Virgina.   Myself, my wife and my two children then noticed a electric blue round light to the east comming towards us at a high rate of speed, about 10,000 ft. In the sky.   As soon as it approached we pointed at it and it immediatly stopped, turned red and maneuvered quickly at a downward right position, turned white and returned to where it had came from very quickly and disappeared from sight.   About 5 minutes later, it again came from same location and height in the sky, electric blue again, circled and turned white and left very quickly in the same fashion as the first time.   Another 3 minutes pass and a final time the blue light came slowly towards us in the same fashion the other times, blinked red turned back to blue and, without stopping, shot backwards without turning or slowing down, and disappeared and didn't return.   This ufo was visible for about 2 min combined from all three sightings.   It was unmistakabley not something any of us had seen before, never made a sound and was travelling at such a high rate of speed it could not have been a manmade aircraft, heli, or balloon.;35.0836999999997;-80.6645999999995
