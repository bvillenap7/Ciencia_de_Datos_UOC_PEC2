Star like object that pulsed a bright red then disappeared.;2010-10-17 01:00:00;About a hour.;Star like object that pulsed a bright red then disappeared. At first sight I thought it was a low star in the sky.  It remained at the same spot in the sky with a blinking white glow for about a hour.  Later as I went back outside I saw the object start to gain a intense light, then the white light turned red and pulsed very brightly.  Brighter then any star or aircraft I have ever seen.   After the objects light turned red and pulsed brightly it rapidly started to dim out going back to having a white light then disappeared and I didnâ€™t see it again. Note: I was in Blowing Rock but the object was a very far distance from me.;36.1355;-81.6996
