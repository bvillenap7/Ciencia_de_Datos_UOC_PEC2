I just moved from an airport area so this was nothing unusual.  When it came over the house I realized it was almost silent, very close to the house with NO airport near.  My husband is a sound engineer and I rushed in to see if he heard and he said he didn't. Very strange. It was HUGE Looked as if it was brushing the tree tops but with no sound!  I can't put into words what I saw~ orange lights on the wings huge wings almost military looking but I have no idea. I don't no where else to report this!;36.0958;-79.2742999999996
