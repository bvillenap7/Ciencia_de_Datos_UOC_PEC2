Unseen object's, Very loud sonic booms over Mebane NC;2003-11-16 01:10:00;5 min;Unseen object's, Very loud sonic booms over Mebane NC Two Extremely loud sonic booms over Mebane N.C. Ok many people in Mebane heard it over a wide area, car alarms went off and folks all over were awakened Sunday morning at about 1:10 am . it was one Very  loud sonic boom followed about 3 to five seconds later by another not quite as loud. which leads me to beleave it was more than one object  I ran outside and that’s when I heard the jet engines (or jets) heading south southwest from where I live. 1 mile north of 85-40 and Buckhorn rd.(I beleave the engine sounds were from fighter type craft not Commercial transport planes.)    Im pretty shure it was more than 1  due to the two very separate sonic booms.  there was a cloud  ceiling so I never saw any lights.  Don’t want to get any of our A.F. pilots in any trouble, but it did startle a lot of people.;36.0958;-79.2742999999996
strange moving light in the night sky above Mebane,  North Carolina;2008-06-06 23:00:00;approx 2 minutes;strange moving light in the night sky above Mebane,  North Carolina I, including my brother and his girlfriend, witnessed a strange moving light in the night sky in Mebane, North Carolina (about 12 miles West of Chapel Hill). It happened the night of Friday June 6. The sighting began approx. 11PM, and lasted a few minutes.  I was talking with my brother on my back deck (his girlfriend was talking on a cell, but witnessed the event as well) and we were also looking at the western sky, enjoying the stars, when I noticed a exceptionally bright, white, stationary star just under the spoon of the big dipper. I thought it a little strange because I didn't remember there was a large star near the big dipper, and from what I know most air traffic is in the north and eastern part of the sky in my immediate area, I do commonly see air traffic there, and there was a few passing around at that time in the east (air traffic headed towards RDU airport I would imagine).  I looked down briefly, and my brother said, I think it's moving...that's not a star, sure enough it did, and it traveled in an easterly direction at a smooth, quick pace. Whatever it was seemed to me to be at relatively high altitude. I noticed It didn't have a trail like a meteor/meteorite. I was also looking to see if it had tail lights or blinking lights, and I saw none.  It traveled for a distance, and it seemed to shrink into a red light about half as bright and size... it strangely turned at an abrupt angle in the opposite direction, traveled again, then remained stationary for a few seconds, then seemed to zip out of sight like it was traveling upwards at a high rate of speed.  It happened so quickly I didn't have time to retrieve my cameras.;36.0958;-79.2742999999996
weird light flys by sounds like a Cessna.;2011-06-17 01:17:00;1 minute;weird light flys by sounds like a Cessna. 1.5 miles north of I/85 Mebane N.C.  Heard what sounded like small single prop airplane coming from east going west,  Wooded area (on deck out back) heard it for about 8 seconds before I saw it. at 5 to 8 thousand feet, saw one bright red bright ( big light not what wing tip light would look like and crimson red) no other lights at all! passed less than one mile from me, while watching through the tree's red light disappeared  as it passed me ( facing north it went east to west) then when at my 10 o'clock saw two dim white lights spread apart where the rear would be. no strobes, no red and green wingtip lights,  no normal 3 strobing lights I normally see on small aircraft!  I kept saying no ((deleted)) way to myself.  If it was a regular small airplane why would it only have one large red light? if they were trying to be sneaky,  why have any light?  If something otherworldly  It was doing a fair job of imitating a small plane. sounded just like a prop plane.  weather was clear!  very light clouds 20,000 feet?  most people would think it was just a small plane flying by. I'm not sure what to think.;36.0958;-79.2742999999996
Low, loud rumble.;2016-09-21 22:14:00;4 minutes;Low Loud Rumble I wish to submit a report even though I did not see nor suspect I may have heard a UAP.  The purpose of my submission is to serve as additional evidence in the event anyone else submits a report from my area. At 22:14 I heard a deep rumble of what may have been a low flying jet.  The ceiling was low due to rain clouds.  This also prevented any visual confirmation.  The sound was loud and intense.  I judge that based on how long it took, it must have been a slow craft. At 22:15 I heard a second, higher pitched craft approaching in the same direction from magnetic west to east.  The second sound overtook the first and passed it.  I make this judgement based on the doppler effect. At 22:16, the doppler effect of the second craft fades below my ability to hear it.  However, the first rumble is still loud.  Based on the doppler effect, I can determine that it has passed overhead. At 22:18 the initial deep rumble fades below my ability to hear it. As I stated before, I submit this in support of any other possible reports you may receive related to tonight from my area. I have no confirmation of this being anything more than rerouted air traffic.  I generally don't see or hear low flying aircraft overhead unless they are military helicopters.;36.0958;-79.2742999999996
