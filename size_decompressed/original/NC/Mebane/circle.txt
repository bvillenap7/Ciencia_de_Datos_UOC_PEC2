I braced thinking an explosion was enevitable. Then it stopped, stayed monentarily still and bing accelerated and gone very fast....like 1000mph and gone. There was a size of a thread stream of flames between the shape of 2 quarters as the object was falling. It seemed to be a mile or 2 miles away and fell about a mile down to the horizon before stopping monetarily and then bing, accelerating and gone. I rolled my paasenger window down going 65 mph on I-40 east and approached up next to driver beside me in the next lane over and asked him if he saw it and he said yes and held his arms up and had no idea what it was either but saw the same thing as I saw. I spun my finger in! a circle signaling a UFO flying saucer and he shook his head and nodded yes and then held his arms up saying I don.t know what else it could be. If it was a top secret plane of some sort it was like nothing I would think a human could withstand the force that would be generated by the falling, stopping, hovering and then flying off...then out of sight. It did not disappear...it flew out of sight.;36.0958;-79.2742999999996
