At app.11:30pm my daughter returned from amovie with 2 friends and thier mother. They called my wife outside extremely excited.  When my wife went out the group was pointing up to an extremely large triangukar vehicle hovering only makin a humming sound.  it had lights of different colors.  There were app two more of these vehicles higher in the sky.  On returning from the movies ,my daughter and freinds saw beams of light coming from the vehicle to the ground.  This was over her school near our house.  My daughter said it was like the vehicle(which was moving slowly) was following them since they passed near the object and them the object made a right turn and come over our house AT TREE TOP LEVEL, MAKING THE TREES SWAY.  There was no noise but a low humming.  At that point the ojects disappeared.   I tried to report this to local sheriff and CAP but was not taken seriuosly.   My family has been very much affected by this sighting.;36.0958;-79.2742999999996
Black triangle escorted by two jets.;2019-07-02 22:03:00;5 minutes;Black triangle escorted by two jets. At 22:03 tonight, I was taking one of my three dogs out for one last time before retiring to bed.  I looked up at the sky above me. I saw a triangular shapped craft flying overhead. It was about 20,000 feet in altitude. It had a flashing red light in the middle and two solid white lights at each point at the rear. The white lights created a reflection off the bottom of the craft. It was clearly a shinny black metallic surface. It was being escorted by two fighter jets. The jets had the standard FAA regulation lights. The jet to the left was at a higher altitude than the craft while the jet to the right was at the same altitude as the craft. They were flying due south. The craft was silent. The only noise came from the jets escorting it. I ran to the back door and shouted to my wife to come out. She came out and witnessed the craft as well. We took pictures but our cell phone did not capture anything other than the indistinguishable lights. We watched it as i! t flew beyond our field of vision toward the south. At arm's length, the craft was approximately 2 inches in length.  In comparison, the jets were about a quarter of an inch. Interesting night here in NC.;36.0958;-79.2742999999996
