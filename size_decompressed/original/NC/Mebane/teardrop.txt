Black object floating across Spring morning sky over Mebane;2005-05-15 07:30:00;6 to 7 minutes;Black object floating across Spring morning sky over Mebane My wife alerted me early one morning to a strage object floating across the sky.  I am uncertain of the exact date--some time during this past spring early in the week before school.  I noted the shape as a teardrop, but we have come to describe it as a floating black peanut.  The object was black and looked like a peanut with the top slightly bigger than the bottom.  We could not make out any distinguishing features.  No lights or moving parts were observe.  The object floated from South-East to North-West and seemed to stay at about the same altitude. It moved at about the same speed as a satelite does (when observed at night of course).  My wife and I simply are curious to the nature of this object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));36.0958;-79.2742999999996
