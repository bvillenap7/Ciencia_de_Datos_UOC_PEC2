My husband, son, and I were camping on a mountain top in Pisgah Natl. Forest.  That night around the fire, I was star gazing when I saw a shape flying form one side of the sky to the other.  It had bright blue and red lights, that blinked slowly and irregularly.  It started flying in a straight line, but suddenly seemed to gracefully and quickly drop down, then fluidly backed up.  It then continued straight in it's new path.  I quickly shouted for my husband to look up.  He watched with me as the shape repeated the same maneuver, before continuing in a line out of  sight. We are professionals in our forties that do not drink or otherwise imbibe.  We were focused on sky watching at the moment and our attention was not diverted.  We are not prone to uneducated conclusions.  I have never seen anything move like this, at such speed, and I do not doubt my vision.;35.2233000000001;-82.7455
