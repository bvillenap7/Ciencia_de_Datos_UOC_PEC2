Odd, slow moving dull red fireball leaving a trail.;2005-12-07 18:55:00;15 seconds;Odd, slow moving dull red fireball leaving a trail. A dull reddish-orange fireball appeared coming form the west and disappeared into the east.  It was not very bright as with the other two fireballs I have witnessed in 30 years of observing the sky.  It left trail that glowed for approx. 5 seconds.  Facing north it was approx. 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon. The odd thing was how slow it moved across the sky.  I have seen hundreds of meteors (I am an amateur astronomer) and I have never seen one move this slowly before.  The other three witnesses agreed that it was moving a lot slower than any meteor they had observed before. I don't know exactly how to put this into words, but the whole event was just odd. I've never seen a meteor moving due east like that, nor acting like it did. It just kept heading east, never growing brighter or dimmer.  This was definitely not an airplane or a satellite, after all it left a trail.;36.1985;-81.1353
