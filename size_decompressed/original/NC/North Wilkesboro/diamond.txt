Diamond-shaped light  flying silently;2007-08-22 21:00:00;25-30 seconds;Diamond-shaped light  flying silently I live in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains of northwest North Carolina.  I was sitting on my patio watching the night sky around 9pm.  I looked up to see a very bright light slowly moving across the sky.  As it approached me I could see that it was an extremely bright diamond-shaped light. I quickly noticed that it didn't have the typical green and red navigation lights of an airplane.  It certainly wasn't a helicopter.  It wasn't a tea lantern (as if somebody would be crazy enough to send one up during this summer drought).  It made no sound and flew slowly from west to east and disappeared behind the tree line.  There were airplanes with typical navigation lights flying in the distance as this object flew over.  The extreme brightness of the object is what caught my eye.  It was similar to the brightest lightbulb light you could ever imagine.  It was more clear white than blue-white or yellow-white.  At arm's length and holding my thumb up for comparison, it was about the size of an pencil eraser and was diamond shaped. What could it be?  It was not anything man-made that I've ever heard of.  I'm reporting this in hope that if other people saw this object, they will do the same.;36.1985;-81.1353
