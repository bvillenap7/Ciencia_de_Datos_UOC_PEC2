(sic) They passed directly over my position. (sic)I have observed many satellites passing on the sky being an avid astrnonmer for 20 years,and these lights moved at the speed of a satellite. They were approx. 1.5 degrees apart forming a 90degree triangle with the base in front.I have not been able to find any info on any webaites about 3 satellites in such close orbits together,and I feel sure the lights were most likely in orbit. Approx. 15 minutes later, 2 more lights approx 1.5 degress apart,side-by-side,followed the exact same trajectory as the triangular formation.There were no airplanes nearby, no strobe lights, and no sound.I see someone in Raleigh saw what seems to be the same thing at the same time(approx.), and I have been hunting all this time for an explaination. If anyone else knows anything please email me.Thanks.;36.1985;-81.1353
