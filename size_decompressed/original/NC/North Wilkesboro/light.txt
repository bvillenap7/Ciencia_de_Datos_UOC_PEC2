I heard no sound.  It was completely quiet.   I have witnessed meteorites, comets and falling stars before and this was something that I have never seen before.  It wasn’t like any kind of star etc.  It was something I can’t explain or understand.   I barely have words for what I saw.  It happened so fast and was probably over a mile away in the distance.  It startled me so much that I immediately went back into my home and woke everyone up.;36.1985;-81.1353
Glowing red light in night sky;2012-04-14 23:15:00;3-5 minutes;Glowing red light in night sky Object was a bright red glowing light, moving slowly from the horizon to a point about 11:00 in the sky.Obcect was moving from the north to the southeast.  At the 11 o'clock position the object stabilized.....no movement for about 30-45 seconds, then began a slow movement to the north east, eventually fading out of sight. The appearance was an very bright red light, steady-not flashing.  The speed of movement was exceptionally slow.  There was no sound.   An aircraft passed higher in the sky moving east to west at the same time.;36.1985;-81.1353
Bright light bulb object over North Wilkesboro, NC.;2014-10-24 20:00:00;~30 seconds;Bright &quotlight bulb&quot object over North Wilkesboro, NC. I was on the front porch looking north at the stars in the night sky.   There were planes flying north to south in their usual flight pattern for this area.  Suddenly I noticed an odd light approximately 1,000 feet up flying west to east that resembled a very bright light bulb. It was rounded and extremely bright.  I called my mother to come and see it, and we watched it fly along in a westerly direction towards downtown North Wilkesboro.  It floated to a certain point and then appeared to turn right and head north, and upon turning, the light faded quickly and was gone.  It was not a plane or a helicopter, had no navigational lights, and it made no noise.;36.1985;-81.1353

I was thinking it would be wonderful to see a ufo, and suddenly straight up in the sky I noticed a star-like light moving in a northern direction that i recognized could be a ufo or a satellite.  At that moment I noticed lower on the northern horizon 3 red lights flying east to west.  I could see the red lights clearly and nothing else.  It was totally odd to see 3 red objects flying one right after the other anywhere in the night sky.  The lights did not conform to aviation lights that I know of.  They disappeared behind a tree line and were gone.;36.1985;-81.1353
Extremely fast satellite (?).;2015-07-07 21:48:00;15 seconds;Extremely fast satellite (?) I spotted what looked to be a satellite approximately 45 degrees above the southern horizon heading north.  It had at least a magnitude 1 brightness.  It moved so fast I thought it might have been an airplane, but never saw any blinking lights, or change in brightness until it faded away to the north in the hazy sky.   I have seen thousands of satellites and all kinds of aircraft in my 40 years of amateur astronomy, but I have never seen a light, satellite, or aircraft move as fast as this light did.  It moved too slowly for a meteor, did not leave a trail, and it crossed the entire sky, from south to north, going directly overhead in less than 15 seconds.  The speed of the object is what astounds me and boggles my mind.;36.1985;-81.1353

However after a more through look it had flashing lights, my significant other even saw the flashing lights and he insisted it was a plane or a helicopter.  However the UFO wasn't moving in a direction, I noticed it shifted back and forth ever so slightly staying in the same place. I observed this item for over 10 minutes staying relatively in the same spot.  I frequently get helicopters and planes overhead, but neither hover or stay in the same area.  At 22:38 the article was no longer visible due to trees.;36.1985;-81.1353
