I live in a rural area of coastal N. C..  Hurricane Ivan had just passed our area.  It was late afternoon and a large part of the sky was clear blue.  After a hurricane the clouds are lied up picturesquely.  I happened to look up because of the beauty of the clear blue sky color, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed a craft moving very slowly northward.  It had no wings, no lights, but appeared to be a smooth oval except for an indistinguishable darker area around center - horizontally.  It semed to be about the height of the cloud bases.  The color was silver  or white reflecting the color of the sky.  I watched it saunter along for a few minutes, I turned my head, and when I turned back It had disappeared.  As slow as it was moving, it couldn't reach the nearest cloud in the area in that split second of time.   ---  ss;36.407;-76.733
