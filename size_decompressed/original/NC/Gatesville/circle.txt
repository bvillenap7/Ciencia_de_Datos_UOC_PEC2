I live in coastal N. C.  It was late afternoon and the sky was hazy blue.  I was in the same general area as the 9/17/04 sighting.  The smooth silvery craft appeared to be at cloud base moving very slowly southeast.  It had no wings, no lights, but appeared to be a smooth circle--may have been bottom of a craft.  As it hit the edge of a cloud a big reflectiion from the sun shot out momentarily.  The craft then started to move slowly upwards (about 10-20') when strange dark straight lines appeared next to it.  I then realized it was approaching the bottom of another much larger craft--the lines were part of the larger ship.  The larger craft was completely invisible to the eye from where I was except for the lines.  The circular craft proceeded to enter a dark, cloud-edged opening and on into the ship and all disappeared. --ss ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD));36.407;-76.733
