Where I live the homes are mostly acreage with a mountain here and there. The closest mountain to me is about 5 to 7 miles away. I have a very clear section where I stand out on my porch at night and can see a large area of the night sky. The night that this took place the sky was clear, no rain or clouds, at approximately midnight. From out of no where I saw a bright light very high in the sky come shooting almost straight across at a very slight downward angle and then it just was gone. This occurred in a matter of seconds, if that. There was no fading of the light as it went by and no fading as it got out of distance. I would set the scenario like this lights on and then lights off, poof, just on and then gone. There was absolutely no sound from it at any point. In all my years I have never seen something like this before. There was no shape of the object other than a light. From memory, I have to lean toward a white light but I cannot be sure. It may have been yellow, but the color would be no other color other than white or yellow. Like said though, from memory I aim towards a white light. I am able to write this information clearly, other than the color of light, because I had written to my friend by email as to the event that took place, so months later now I am reporting this event that took place since I was able to come across this site. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.3325;-80.4436
