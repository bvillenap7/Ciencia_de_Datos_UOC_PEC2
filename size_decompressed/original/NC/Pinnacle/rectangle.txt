I watched it for quite a while, it may have been up to 5 minutes.   It had two stationary lights on the front, and had a clearly defined outline.  It was probably grey/black in color.  The lights were an Amber orange color. They were not moving  The craft was not moving, and made no sound, I know this because I turned the car radio off, rolled the windows down, and slowed the car way down.  I lost sight of it after a few miles, and tried to see it from my yard with my husband, but could not;36.3325;-80.4436
