As big as a car and moving together I saw 2 greenish circles connected in the center moving from east to west over Efland Cedar Grove Rd.  The object was slightly bigger than a car and was moving fast just above the treeline.  The lead circle was much bigger than the trail.  I initially thought it was a helicopter but there was no noise whatsoever and both circles were in profile as if it were two letter Os, not the ovals one would see from static off of a helicopter.;36.2033;-79.1674
