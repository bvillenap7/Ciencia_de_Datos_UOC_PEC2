My husband and I were driving and as we approached an intersection near a small airport, there was this large triangular shaped object (very close to the ground) slowly moving over the intersection.  As we got closer to it, it had three large blue lights (one in each corner).  About 30 ft from it, it suddenly raised up and made a fast u-turn.  In less than 5 seconds it was gone, quickly heading the other way.  About 3 miles from the intersection, my husband and I looked back and it seemed to be a hovering bright light at or near the airport.  The strangest thing about the whole ordeal was there was no sound at all.  (Note: There was a car about 2 car-lengths in front of us.  I am pretty sure they saw it too.  Believe me, you couldn't miss it.);36.2601;-76.0446

It then proceeded south  along 343  steadily increasing speed .I then lost sight of the craft. The underside of the craft was unusual with three conical shaped depressions that glowed a  bluish color that turned to white as it picked up speed. The top of the craft was jet black.
