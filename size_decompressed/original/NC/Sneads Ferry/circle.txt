Was out fishing when 3 orange lights appeared out over the ocean.  They did not move, change color or anything. these were not flairs or any know aircraft.  They made no sound.   They just appeared high in the sky and remainied stationary.  Then they just disappeared.   Shortly sfter they vanished the Military aircraft activity was heavy.  I counted atleast 6 - 8 helicopter gunships in the air flying all over.;34.5435;-77.4086

Around 23:30 we started to see very bright orange lights appear in the sky. The orange lights would flicker as if they were burning, with occasionally possible embers falling from it. These lights did not move at all, they would appear VERY brightly and stay bright for about 2 minutes and just fade out and disappear. The video does not do the brightness of the lights justice. They were as bright as the sun.  The location that we were fishing at did have a sightseeing telescope, but all I could see when i looked through it was a bright orange circle.  All of the lights stopped around 23:58 and did not return.;34.5435;-77.4086
