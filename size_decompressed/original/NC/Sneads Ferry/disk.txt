((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of three reports from same student.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME SOURCE)) The object that I saw was a saucer shape with lights all around it,and it was longer than a bus. At 9:54 p.m. Tuesday December 31,2001 I was in my room getting ready for bed but I started hearing some noise so I went out to my living room to look out the back door.I was looking out the door for about 2 minutes then I seen a flash of light I just thought it was a flasu of lightning but then it hit me that it was a clear night,then I saw a saucer shaped craft huvering over a house it had lights all around it,and a dome on the top.It was so close to the house it was almost touching it so I ran back to my room to get a camera but when I got back out there it was gone.Now i've been keeping this quiet for 4 months,and i'm sorry that I don't have a photograph,but I promise that I will send you one when I see another object.I'm 14 years old I live in Sneads Ferry,N.C. which is just a small fishing village.Now i've seen some strange things because I do astronomy i've seen the death of a star,and to comets collied with each other.But what I saw on December 31 was not like any thing i've seen before.;34.5435;-77.4086
