formation of red flashing lights in sync about a half mile long;2002-07-20 20:00:00;10 minutes;formation of red flashing lights in sync about a half mile long I lived in a 3rd floor condo with a deck viewing the atlantic ocean.  around dusk my dog began barking at the sliding glass doors to the deck.  I looked out and saw a series of flashing red lights in an absolute straight line on the horizon moving south toward fort fisher at a steady pace.  i then ran down to the beach and there were many people standing facing the lights, some on their decks others in the surf but staring in silence.  We all watched the formation float down the coast past the Kure Beach pier.  What eludes me is the absence of any sound and the strict line of flashing red lights that must have stretched for a half mile.  All lights were flashing in sync. In my opinion, helicopters and/or planes could not have flown in a strict line especially without noise and the number of planes or helicopters it would have taken to make a formation that long would be huge.    I asked a few people standing near me for an explanation, but noone had a clue. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.1513751381215;-77.8741878453036
