Several Triangular Vessels with bright red lights.;2014-05-13 21:30:00;30 minutes;Several Triangular Vessels with bright red lights While vacationing at Carolina Beach, NC this week (oceanfront) on May 13th, 2014 we saw 4-5 vessels, each with 3 red lights (triangular), one large red one on top and 2 red lights on the bottom. They were large and stationary, no noise, no sound.  Some would immediately disappear without moving and another would appear.  All in the same spot.  We watched these for 30 minutes before they disappeared for good. We watched every night after without success.  The lights appeared at approximately 9:30 PM to about 10 PM.  This is the very first time either one of us had seen something so strange and we were excited.  Had a phone camera but the quality is very, very poor.  It was simply amazing!;34.1513751381215;-77.8741878453036
