Orange-pink lights/fireballs. Appeared singly and in pairs/patterns over the ocean. Could've been weaponry.;2012-04-09 21:00:00;About 15 minutes the firs;Orange-pink lights/fireballs.  Appeared singly and in pairs/patterns over the ocean.  Could've been weaponry. It started as single fireballs over the ocean, which i thought may be distress flares.  After seeing a few single orange-pink colored balls light up and disappear they got more rapid.  Then one appeared standing in a single place another appeared next to it.  As the first disappeared, a third came of view...neatly spaced apart.  After about 20-35 minutes of seeing nothing, a few, less vibrant, single lights appeared.  They were spaced apart by seconds as before. Then, there were two pairs of 2 lights which were visible at the same time but came and went separate times.  I dont remember exactly what their movements/patterns were.  The last event was right after pairs appeared and danced.  A triplet of the orange lights appeared...expanded apart from one another then sucked back in close to each other.

3 fireballs observed above the ocean at Carolina Beach, NC;2012-05-08 20:50:00;4 minutes;3 fireballs observed above the ocean at Carolina Beach, NC Full Sighting Description Descriptions of the objects:  The objects emitted a red ball of light (“fireball”) at the center surrounded by a red-magenta translucent aura outlined in gold.  The objects at no point in time made any sound whatsoever.  The objects were located above the ocean approximately 2 o’clock with respect to the horizon. The visibility that night was clear with a backdrop of clouds and stars.  The objects appeared to emit/disappear into the clouds themselves as though they were integrating themselves into the clouds when they turned on or off. Timeline:  1)  First minute of viewing: I observed one fireball stationary in the sky hovering for about 15 seconds appearing as one fireball.  During this time the fireball appeared to morph into a brighter red color giving birth to another fireball directly to the left of the first one creating two fireballs.  The second fireball morphed/gave birth to the third fireball.  The term gave birth to can best be described as originating from the first, then the second, and the second making the third.  For a total of three fireballs lined up horizontally. 2)  Second minute of viewing:  The three horizontal fireballs drifted into the 12 o’clock position in the sky, the other off to 3 o’clock, and the third moved up to 9 o’clock position.  The three fireballs repositioned themselves again and appeared in higher or lower positioning moving at a med-slow speed several more times staying in approximately the same area of the clouds but with different formations.  Then, the fireballs were observed to become integrated/dispersed into the clouds themselves as they disappeared into the backdrop of the clouds. 3)  Third minute of viewing:  The three fireballs came back on in completely different positions in the sky one at 10 o clock, the other at 5 o’ clock, and the other 11 o’clock.  The objects appeared to move up/down/side-to-side repositioning themselves in the clouds and looking as though they became absorbed by the clouds themselves. 4)  Forth minute of viewing:  After the lights went off they came back on within the span of about 2 seconds.  The three fireballs were located in completely different locations (with respect to before).  The objects appeared to move up/down/side-to-side repositioning themselves in the clouds before going off for the final time.

Observed 1 orange/ yellow fireball shoot down the alley about 20ft from where I was sitting on Carolina Beach, NC.;2017-09-22 23:45:00;5 second;Observed 1 orange/ yellow fireball shoot down the alley about 20ft from where I was sitting on Carolina Beach, NC. I was sitting on my back porch last night looking at the stars.  It was a clear night with minimal humidity.  I live in aa neighborhood that is pitch dark at night.  There was.no noise or evidence of any one out and about that time of night. Out the corner of my eye, I noticed an orange/yellowish light.  In that moment, a sphere of fiery looking light energy moved quickly down the alley by the back of my house.  This fireball moved quickly in a lateral trojectory with no sound approximately 20ft away from where I was sitting and no more than 15ft above the ground.  The total event lasted 5 - 8 seconds and disappeared. There was only 1 fireball.  A dog in the neighborhood started barking about the time this fireball started to disappear.  The fireball was about the size of a large cantaloupe. It startled me and still can't believe what my eyes saw. I went out the next morning and didn't see any evidence of anything burning. I am a medical professional with a Masters degree and post graduate studies.;34.1513751381215;-77.8741878453036
