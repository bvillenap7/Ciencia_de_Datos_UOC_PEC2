Reddish-orange lights sighted at Carolina Beach;2016-01-06 03:00:00;5:00;Name of photo:  Reddish-orange lights sighted at Carolina Beach, January 6, 2016.  Description and date of incident:  The photo was taken on 1/5/16 approximately between 2-3AM Eastern Standard Time.   Location:  The ocean horizon of Carolina Beach, North Carolina, in front of the boardwalk.   The red-amber colored lights blinked off and on all night long until the sun came up (no craft, just lights).   Note:  This picture was taken on a tripod, as well as, time exposed due to nighttime visibility.  I tried using a cell phone but it would not work because it was too dark. I can rule out any identifiable structures (boat/other) related to the lights seen.  I'm not sure what this is?  The lights appeared separated but together (no identifiable structure associated with it) at the same time and followed a sequencing of left to right and then right to left repeatedly until the sun came up.;34.1513751381215;-77.8741878453036
Flashing multi colored lights in the night sky.;2016-09-13 21:30:00;10 minutes;Flashing multi colored lights in the night sky. Sept 13, 2016, Carolina Beach, NC.  My friend and I witnessed multi-colored lights over the ocean.  Sometimes in a straight line then diagonal.  Red, blue, green and white lights in a row would hover for a few seconds then disappear or to reappear a few miles away.  It happened 3 times then they was gone.  Could not seen any air crafts just lights since is was nighttime.;34.1513751381215;-77.8741878453036
