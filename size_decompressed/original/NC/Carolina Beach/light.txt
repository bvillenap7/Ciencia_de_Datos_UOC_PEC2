The lights were colored a reddish/magenta larger than a star in diameter and appearing as a bright light.  The objects were approximately the size of two stars combined and circular in diameter.  The lights came on brightly and pulsated in color becoming brighter and shutting off.

((ADDENDUM #1 FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) Hi, I accidentally gave consent to release my Information on your UFO website and couldn't uncheck the box before it continued the page.  Could you please remove my information?  Thanks ((END ADDENDUM)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM SOURCE)) Thank you! I was on my phone and accidentally clicked it.

Orange lights still being seen around the Carolina Beach area mainly during the first 2 hours after dark.;2014-09-02 21:20:00;2-3 seconds;Orange lights still being seen around the Carolina Beach area mainly during the first 2 hours after dark. Having seen lights in the sky on the Outer Banks in 2004 and at Carolina Beach in 2013, I take my camera with me to the beach and set it up at nights trying to catch a video of the lights.  On Tuesday night while watching from the top floor balcony of the motel I was staying at I observed an orange light in the sky a little left from straight out in front of me at about a 30 degree angle up.  I estimated it was at cloud level about half way between me and the horizon.  The light came on and grew in intensity quickly then maintained that brightness for about 2 seconds then faded out just as quickly. It appeared about pea size at arms length.  At 9:43(21::43) it appeared again but this time at the horizon a little to the right of center.  Then once again a little to the right of it a few seconds after.  I did not see any again until around 10:00(22:00) Friday night while fishing at Freeman Park in the inlet.  Two orange lights appeared just above the buoy that! has the white blinking light out in front of the inlet near the horizon.  Again they only appeared for about 2-3 seconds each, one after the other.  During none of these sightings did I hear any aircraft, plane, jet, or helicopter.  I did not have my camera pointing in the right direction during any of the attempts to video them.  These orange lights are completely different from the red dividing lights I saw at Avon, NC on the outer banks in 2004.;34.1513751381215;-77.8741878453036
