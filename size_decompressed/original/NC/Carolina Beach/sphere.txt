Orange orbs over coast of Carolina Beach,;2014-06-17 21:30:00;15 minutes;Orange orbs over coast of Carolina Beach. My daughter and I got to Carolina Beach at 9:00 pm. At 9:30pm we witnessed what I thought a star exploding would look like.  I bright orange,red orb glowing brighter and brighter and then just dimmed away.   About a minute later three more lights in sequence from left to right repeated the first orbs action of glowing extremely bright and the dimming away.  We did not see any craft but these lights were larger than any airplane.  And was too far above the water to be a boat. The lights were about 300 yards apart from each other.  We returned again tonight 6/18/14 and at 9:30pm on the dot my daughter and I witnessed them again.  This time we only saw them one time.  Much further off in the distance this time but I could make out a v formation of the orbs.keep in mind again we have not witnessed any craft.  But I think these lights are enough.   I'll be back again tomorrow night same time.;34.1513751381215;-77.8741878453036
