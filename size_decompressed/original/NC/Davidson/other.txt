As the large, gray billowy clouds separated, the rays of the sun hit a brilliant bright, silver top of a very large dome sitting in the sky toward the northeast.  I told my husband,  Look, that object looks like the  'Dome of the Rock,' except it is silver!   My husband looked but we had driven on part of I-77 that sloped down and all you could see were trees at the next exit (Davidson).I told him to wait until we came across the next section of Lake Norman but the area was clouded again.  The object was not exposed. This is the closest description, other than the dome was almost a little bell shaped as well, with the top being a little flatter.  With the sun hitting the object, it was a brilliant, shining silver (and was definitely not a hot air balloon).;35.4849714285714;-80.8000063492064
