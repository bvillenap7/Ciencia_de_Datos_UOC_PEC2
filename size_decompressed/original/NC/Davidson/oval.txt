Grey, oval-shaped object over Davidson, North Carolina.;2017-12-12 16:00:00;5 minutes;Grey Oval shaped object over Davidson, North Carolina. I was on the way to drop off my friends drivers license as she left it at my house the night before.  It was around 4ish in the afternoon on December 12th, 2017, in Davidson NC.  Right down the road from my house I noticed a dark grey oval shape in the sky partially blocked by clouds.  I thought maybe it was an airplane but as I drove down the road it didnt move. It stayed exactly in the same place in the sky not moving.  I kept driving and kept an eye on it.  Eventually I lost sight of it when I drove through a wooded area but after I emerged from the forest I could see the shape again.  I wanted to get a picture of it so I pulled over and parked in a nearby church parking lot and when I looked for it I couldn't find it anywhere.  I continued driving down Davidson Concord road and its like it just vanished.;35.4849714285714;-80.8000063492064
