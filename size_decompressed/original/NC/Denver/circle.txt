Single black dot flying through clouds during day in Denver, NC;2020-07-15 17:57:00;1 minute;Single black dot flying through clouds during day in Denver, NC I was sitting alone outside watching tv on my Samsung Galaxy Tab A.  By some random chance I saw what looked like a tiny black dot moving in and out of some clouds.  It moved relatively slowly from what my compass shows as 157.2 degrees to 347.5 degrees through the sky.  There was no sound from the craft.  I quickly switched on my video function on the tablet.  In the background I think you can hear an airplane in the distance.  This is very common where I live - there are always planes flying over our housing plan.  I thought it was odd for a craft to be flying so high when there are airplanes close by on a regular basis.  After watching the video I took and zooming in on the round craft, I dismissed it in my mind as probably a drone.  However, due to the craft being so high and going through clouds, it might be of some interest and be considered unidentified.  The black dot did not seem to change shape and was flying at a steady rate of speed. ! I lost sight of the craft when it flew over my house.;35.4875000000001;-80.9876000000002
