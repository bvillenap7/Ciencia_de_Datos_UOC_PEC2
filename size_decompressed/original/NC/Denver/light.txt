Approx. the time mentioned above, 2 rapidly moving lights moved vertically in the sky.  The lights were dimly glowing.  They appeared to be moving jaggedly in a fluttering motion and were not in unison with each other.  They were not very high up, and the sightings could not be seen for long due to trees blocking my view.;35.4875000000001;-80.9876000000002
Sighting of distant object moving at high speed exhibiting ability to almost instantly jump ahead and laterally.;2018-04-03 06:00:00;90 seconds;Sighting of distant object moving at high speed exhibiting ability to almost instantly jump ahead and laterally. On 04/03/2018, at approximately 06:00, I observed a fast-moving object at apparently very high altitude, moving from North to South.  It crossed between the two stars in Ursa Major that point towards Polaris and Polaris itself, somewhat closer to Polaris.  Object appeared to be at significantly greater altitude than commercial airliners, though possibly attainable by military aircraft.  It reminded me somewhat of early satellites which did not follow the earth's rotation in terms of brightness, but speed was greater.  The object was too distant to determine size or shape.  The sky was cloudless and dark. What caught my attention was that it appeared to consistently move at what I surmised to be several times the speed of sound, yet several times instantly “jump ahead” some distance.  Distance “jumped” was hard to estimate due to altitude, but I would say in the tens of miles each time.  Twice, the object “jumped” laterally as well, though I would estimate a shorter distance.   I followed the object until it passed the treeline at my house.;35.4875000000001;-80.9876000000002
