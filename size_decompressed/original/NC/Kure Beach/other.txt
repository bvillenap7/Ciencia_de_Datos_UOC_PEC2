Lights with fired object from larger craft;2021-03-17 21:20:00;5 minutes;Lights with fired object from larger craft Triangle with the front with glowing Red and Orange/Purple light. Came from Southeast from ocean.  Stayed in that same type formation. Then it glowed bright white from front tip of triangle formation. Fired a white type circular type object that traveled west then went towards the west. It circled over the Cape Fear River to MOTSU Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal. Then back over land to the ocean, Then it disappears. Kinda like it burned out or went dark. Estimated speed was at least 4x a normal airliner it appeared. No noise at all.  Idk if it’s extra terrestrial or some military aircraft. But seems very high tech with extreme high speed.  Btw: It’s becoming routine to see these strange incidents between 20:15 to 22:45 hours almost every night now. If it’s clear outside. Always coming off the ocean. Never appear on flight tracker either.;33.9916;-77.9052
