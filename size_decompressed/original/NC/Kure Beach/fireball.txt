Orange glow disappears over kure beach, nc after 10-15 seconds.;2013-08-17 22:30:00;10 seconds;Orange glow disappears over kure beach, nc after 10-15 seconds. Was sitting with my father in law on vacation when we saw an orange glow rise up over land and move out over the ocean.  I figured it was a plane but planes usually have flashing lights on the wings.  There were no flashing lights.   We watched it for a few more seconds and the orange glow started to get dimmer as it moved away.  It disappeared after about 10-15 seconds.  Don't know if it was some sort of rocket or what but it definitely wasn't a plane.;33.9916;-77.9052

Same sort of event I saw two days earlier except this was much shorter.  A small orange fireball appeared off the coast, zig zagged for a split second and then shot upwards.  The whole event took just a few seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.9916;-77.9052
