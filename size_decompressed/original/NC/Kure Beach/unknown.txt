Orange lights over ocean.;2014-06-17 20:30:00;30 minutes;Orange lights over ocean. After dusk, when the sky was darker, but not totally black, we saw an orange light (single) come on and fade out gradually over a duration of a few seconds.  Then about 45 seconds later, a second light came on towards the south of the original (same pattern/duration).  Then it started about 5 minutes later even further south.  Again, seeing two (but this time one of them had a double vertical light).   15 minutes later they were spotted north (double the area they were at previously).  Only this time there were three of them.  One was a single light, one was a double light and the last had three horizontal lights (like square window shapes - while the double was verticle circles).   Then a few minutes later, they showed back up around the same area, but the three lighted one was much closer to us.  They were way out over the ocean, had no streak marks like a flare or firework would.  We thought they could be military craft, but they didn't fly right.;33.9916;-77.9052
