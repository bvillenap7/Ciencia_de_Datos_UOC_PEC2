Orange and yellow elongated fireball looking object.;2016-07-23 22:35:00;45 seconds;Orange and yellow elongated fireball looking object. While looking east at the ocean a bright orange and yellow elongated shape appeared over the water.  It traveled slowly in a straight line north.  It became smaller and circle shaped but still had a yellow and orange glow like a fire ball.  It got smaller until it disappeared. There was no sound and it was above the horizon.  It did not disappear into the water.  From when I first saw it to when it disappeared, was maybe half a mile.;33.9916;-77.9052
