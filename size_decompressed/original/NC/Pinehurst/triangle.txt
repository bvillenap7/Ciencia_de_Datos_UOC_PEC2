Two triangular craft, hovering low;1995-04-15 22:00:00;30 seconds;Two triangular craft, hovering low I was on my way to work, a little before 10:00 p.m., driving on a residential street in Pinehurst. I saw two sets of lights in triangular patterns, each set had two red lights and one white light.The lights were steady and very bright, they did not blink or vary in intensity. The lights were hovering, motionless and very low, seemingly less than 50 feet above the treetops. At first I thought the two sets of lights might have both been connected to the same structure, but I then saw one set slowly drift a few feet , while the other set remained in place. I rolled down my window and slowed down to about 5 miles per hour, trying to hear anything, but there was no sound. My first thought was they may have been helicopters, but I'm sure I would have heard the chopper blades, as low as they were. In the darkness, I could  make out the outlines of dark-colored structures above the lights. I've always wished I would have waited to see what happened next, but not wanting to be late, I drove on. The next morning I thought about calling the local paper or police to see if anyone else had reported seeing this, since it happened in a residential area with houses all around, but was too embarrased.
