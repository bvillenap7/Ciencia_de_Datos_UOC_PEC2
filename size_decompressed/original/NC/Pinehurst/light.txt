Soundless light moving across sky in odd movements.;2014-08-22 05:00:00;1 hour;Soundless light moving across sky in odd movements. My husband and I were out on our back deck letting our dogs out when we saw a light moving fast across the sky.  It then turned around and went the opposite direction (no noise ever made).   A couple minutes later we witnessed it shoot across the other side of the sky and completely stood still for 10-15 mins before taking off and vanishing.   Around the same time we were watching this light, 2 planes flew above with flickering red lights and normal plane sounds.  This light was 3 times faster than the plane and made no noise at all!  Absolutely amazing!!;35.1873;-79.473
