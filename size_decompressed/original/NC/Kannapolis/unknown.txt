It was around 8:36 P.M on a friday night.We just left O'Charleys and were riding home in my dads car.We just entered the wooded part of the ride home.On the left there was a pasture but a little beyound that was the woods.On the right was more woods.I was looking out my window like usually when i ride home.There all of a sudden there was a light that i have never seen before.I knew it wasnt a star because i would look at the stars alot and had never seen one like that.There was a bright yellowish light coming from a squarish circle figure with a hump comeing from the top.It was shining apon me and the car from a long way in the sky.The light wasnt bright enough to see unless you would look up.Then the light shifted to the back of the car.It satyed there for quite some time.Then shifted to the other side of the car from where it started.I couldnt belief what i was seeing,the light,the craft it had left me without words.I couldnt even tell my dad what I was seeing.It was unbelievable.Then without me seeing it again it disappeared.I never even saw they light stop it just blanked out of my eyes.

2 red lights, side by side;2002-01-15 00:00:00;35 seconds;2 red lights, side by side I was driving on East 1st street in Kannapolis NC, and I saw these two red lights side by side, no blinking, no strobing, they reminded me of stoplights, except they were not as bright, and as far as I could tell, not very far away, I rolled my window down and heard nothing except the wind, the two red lights looked rather large and I thought it was odd that I heard no sound.;35.4873805668021;-80.6085688259113
