The black dot stayed on a steady course.;2013-06-25 16:20:00;1 minute;The black dot stayed on a steady course. I was at my workplace before clocking in and I was outside and it was partly to mostly sunny(a lot of clouds) I saw a black dot on a eastern course, at first I thought it was a bird except it stayed on a straight line, it did not waver or wonder from this course. I had to walk around the corner to keep track.  I ruled out a plane or a jet for 2 reasons, the first is it made no sound and the second was that most of the time a jet or plane appears white or silver against a blue sky.   This was a solid black dot, slightly larger that the period at the end of this sentence.  I watched it for a good solid minute, it just remained on the steady course and grew smaller until it was out of sight.;35.4873805668021;-80.6085688259113
