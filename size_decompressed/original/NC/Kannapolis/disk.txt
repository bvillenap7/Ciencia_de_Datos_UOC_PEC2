I was stopped at a red light, heading east on Dale Earrhardt Blvd.I looked above the ligths and saw a small round object,it was tilted at about a 40 degree angle.What caught my eye is the fact it was chrome and going very slow. Then the disk turned so I could see the bottom,it was also chrome. The strange part was the sun was almost in front of me,but just a hair to the right.  So that means the sun was behind the disk. So how did the chrome body shine the way it did, but the strangest part is after a few seconds it disappered, just like some one turned off a light!!!  I never reappered. The sky was compelty clear,not a cloud in sight. The reason I weaited to report this is I wanted to see the local news papers and news on tv, to see if anyone else saw the disk, they didn't.;35.4873805668021;-80.6085688259113
