brilliant light coming and going;1994-10-17 10:35:00;20 seconds;brilliant light coming and going i was sitting on a bicycle in my grandmothers driverway...with my cousin..a very bright brilliant light at first white..changing into blue and shades of redish orangish like a fire...lit up all of the sudden..it acted as if it was a rocket and shot straight up...at what seem about 3/4 of a mile away and was no sound at all...the light went up for i'd say about 5 or 600 yards and quickly dissapated..we both looked at each other and i seen a shadow off of my cousin standing beside me when the light came back but much lower in the sky..we both thought that it was a rocket the way it went back up but at a angle like 75 degrees or so..once again it was changing colors and moving very quick with no sound...it then went out like a rocket out of fuel...and once more came back to light the sky just a little lower than when it burnt out...and shot straight up for at least 1000 ft and took a turn toward the north and was gone...to this day i have no idea what it was;35.4873805668021;-80.6085688259113
A long light, like a star that moved fast and kinda sparkled.  Moved in full view, low in the sky in less than 60 seconds;2003-10-20 23:30:00;< 60 seconds;A long light, like a star that moved fast and kinda sparkled.  Moved in full view, low in the sky in less than 60 seconds I was on my front porch smoking and I noticed this long light, like a star that moved fast and kinda sparkled moving south. (coming from behind the house next to mine and moving south) The strangest thing was that it moved into and out of full view in less than 60 seconds and it was really low in the sky. I called my friend who lives one street over in hopes that he was also outside smoking and asked him if he saw it too.  He was not outside at that time so he did not, however he did go out and look and he saw three helicopters moving in from the south and they were circling and literally hovering in an area in the south west about 6 or so miles away. I was still on the phone with him while he was telling me about the helicopters and I hung up and walked (about a block) over to his house and I could see the helicopters myself.  They were too far away to have caused the light that I saw.  But they were certainly searching for something.  On the 11:00 news there was a report that there had been many calls into 911 about bright lights in the sky and rattling of houses.  The reporter stated that it was a meteor shower.  Funny thing is, I've never known a meteor shower to happen that low to the ground and especially so low it causes houses to shake.  And exactly what were those three helicopters investigating???;35.4873805668021;-80.6085688259113

((NUFORC Note:  Date may be flawed.  The date of the alleged sighting, we suspect, may have been August 27, not July 27.

Driving down interstate 85 south to Charlotte, from Kannapolis, NC.  Saw a bright green light fall from the sky.  Almost the color of a traffic light.  It had no tail or trail so I don't think it was a meteor.   There is no way I am the only witness.  Traffic was very heavy at the time.   The light disappeared behind some buildings.;35.4873805668021;-80.6085688259113

It appears to be curious of the infrared light emitting diodes on my camera.  I thought it was a drone but no air was moving around the nearby shrubs. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date.

Drone like UFO captured on video;2019-06-28 01:38:00;1:38;Drone like UFO captured on video Video captured drone like object 7 times tough out the night.  First video starts at 1:38 and last video is at 5:30 AM.  The object appeared to be interested in the IR lights on my camera, but unlike a drone the object did not disturb the near by shrubs at all like a drone would from its fan blades.  The object also appears to be flying at a 5 degree tilt in a consistent pattern with 4 lights across the horizontal surface of the object.;35.4873805668021;-80.6085688259113
