triangular reddish reflective object flying South;2007-09-18 20:40:00;7-10 seconds;triangular reddish reflective object flying South My neighbor had told me of a photo you showed on TV today that was taken 9/18 near Charlotte. I could not find information on this website about this , and was hoping to confirm what I had observed the two previous evenings. Outiside At approximately 8:40pm on Sunday 9/16  after sunset I was observing the evening sky saw two small (blueish)dimly lit round objects travelling from North to South over the Kannapolis area. They appeared larger than a star or satellite, but (reflective ?)brightness of about half of the surrounding average stars. They appeared to be very high elevation, and faster than any  manned aircraft I have ever observed. Speed estimate would be slower than a meteor, and much faster than a satellite when viewed from Earth and moving about 5 degrees apart at exact speed and direction, one following the other. They crossed the sky  about 25 degrees above the North horizon to about 25-30 degrees from reaching the Southern Horizon and duration of abount 15-20 seconds. Curiously enough, I was again outside at  aproximately 8:40 pm on Monday 9/17. I did not see the same objects, instead only a single. Appearing larger, (about 3/4 thumbnail at arm length) and a triangular in exact symmetry. Coloration was dim, but reddish hue possibly from reflection ,against the early twilight blue. This object appeared to follow the exact previous North to South path , but may have been considerably larger or lower in Altitude. The triangular object speed was nearly 2-3 times faster than the previous, with the duration of about 7-10 seconds to cross the sky. Neither obsevations included atmoshereic disturbances, contrails, or sound activity. Elevation, I believe was low orbit, maybe several miles above commercial aircraft. I tried but did not observe anything other than normal aircraft/satellite activity on 9/18 from 8:35 pm until 9:00 pm. Probably the object you saw was a few minutes earlier than what I was prepared for. I would really be interested in seeing an image on the website, or maybe a link to it if possible. Tonight will be cloudy, so observing will be limited for this area.... Just wanted ask, if you know, since this is a repeating occurance, can it be referenced with airport radar?   ** amateur astonomer- cleaning telescope this is e-mail copy i sent to local weather correspondent, after hearing that he broadcast a photo on Monday's daytime weather report. No reply, no link listed on the TV website;35.4873805668021;-80.6085688259113
3 white lights in triangular formation hovering in the NW sky of Kannapolis.;2014-12-03 21:30:00;2-5 minutes;3 white lights in triangular formation hovering in the NW sky of Kannapolis. 3 bright white lights in a triangle formation.  Seen in the NW sky completely still for a minute or so and then slowly descended straight down below tree line and was out of sight.;35.4873805668021;-80.6085688259113
Triangular shaped hovering aircraft in sky on highway 3 and Kannapolis Parkway.;2016-10-23 21:15:00;10-15 minutes;Triangular shaped hovering aircraft in sky on highway 3 and Kannapolis Parkway. I was driving home to Mooresville from the Kannapolis area and noticed in the sky there was a triangular shaped aircraft hovering above the trees on the left side of Kannapolis Parkway headed toward Mooresville.  It was not moving and did not make a sound.  I passed it and then on turning down highway 3, headed toward Mooresville, I was on the phone with my grandmother and had to stop talking I was so shocked at what I saw in the sky.  I saw about 5 or 6 hovering triangular aircraft with 3 lights on each angle lining the road.   As I approached Odell School Rd and Hwy 3 intersection, I saw to my left about a quarter of a mile away roughly 8-10 if not more lights in the sky that were moving around erratically in strange formation.  The lights spanned close to half a mile and were a good distance away.;35.4873805668021;-80.6085688259113
