Multiple sightings of star like object moving in rapid precise movements across the night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius?  PD);2007-08-17 21:00:00;1 hour;Multiple sightings of star like object moving in rapid precise movements across the night sky Over the last two weeks I have been observing several unidentified objects in the area North of Charlotte, NC.  These objects hover and then move very rapidly across the night sky.  I have witnessed these objects travel several miles, stop, change direction, move slowly and actually travel in a complete 360 degrees around my view on the back deck at my home.  I have actually seen these objects slowly move across the sky and then move quickly to an area very close to passing aircraft and actually move with the aircraft for quite a distance.  These objects appear to look like a star falling from the sky but have distinct movements and do not fade out like a star falling through the atmosphere. They appear to be very small in size but last night they appeared a few times as though they had a cloaking effect and you could make out a shadow of a much larger object.
