Strange Lights over Eastern NC.;2004-03-10 20:00:00;2-3 minutes;Strange Lights over Eastern NC. I was walking out ot my car to go to my night job, and I I just happened to catch a glimpse of some strange looking lights in the sky. I turned  and watched them for a couple of minutes.  They were a group of 6 or so orange/ amber colored lights moving in a south westerly direction. Immediately following the orange lights, were two smaller red lights that moved in odd directtions. I also saw at least two military aircraft chasing the objects. I could recognize the red and green lights that are common on planes.  I could see no other lights on the group of orange lights, or the two smaller red lights. I watched  the lighs until the went beyond my means of viewing. There were no reports made on the news about the lights, but I know several other people saw them as well.;35.1060208333332;-77.0700249999999

they were both bright lights.;2008-09-22 20:00:00;3 minutes;they were both bright lights. They both looked close because they were very big and bright and flew right over us at slow speed like it just hovered but then one of them sped out of view very fast, but the other one just kept the same speed until it was out of view.they were bigger and brighter than any of the stars and maybe about the same size of a full moon.

Fluidly, floating, white light.;2013-12-28 18:00:00;2 minutes;Fluidly,floating,white light. We were playing basketball in driveway.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye, what appeared to be a star moving.  In comparison the light was as big as a star in the sky, but way brighter.  I guess it to have been cloud height.  It jutted forward with amazing speed, stopped for a brief second, then went up and down while moving forward across the sky.  Suddenly it stopped, backed up a little ways and then did a complete and perfect circle flying backwards in the sky. It moved like fluid if that makes sense.  After the circle it just floated straight ahead until the light went out or it went into cloud cover, i am not sure.  Was heading due east.;35.1060208333332;-77.0700249999999
3 bright lights horizontaly in a row;2020-12-23 21:00:00;15 seconds;3 bright lights horizontaly in a row I had stepped out of my back door onto my porch, when I went to the steps I looked out past my tree and saw 3 very bright lights horizontally in a row over towards town. They looked like work lights, but they were way to high to be work lights. They were not very high above the trees and when I saw them, they did not appear to be moving. It was very cold and for what ever reason It did not occur to me they might not be of this world, until I read the report from Fort Bragg, and these were exactly what they described. I wish I had gone back out with my camera, maybe next time.;35.1060208333332;-77.0700249999999
Lights in the night sky;2021-01-19 22:45:00;unk;Lights in the night sky Just came back in, witnessed 3 lights high in the sky around the 10 o'clock position. They did not appear to be moving, their were only 3, I know I had heard about people reporting satellites in the sky, but when I checked the web the ones they were reporting were a string, and according to the pictures there were a lot more than just three. That's the only reason I am reporting these. They did not appear to be moving at all. I had to come in, they may be gone now.   I went back out, could barely make them out some lights clouds in the sky. Took a small movie and picked up other lights, they appear to be blinking, and possibly moving farther away. I checked the aircraft radar for the US and nothing was flying even close to my location.;35.1060208333332;-77.0700249999999
