SEVERAL SMALL CRAFT WITH VERY LARGE WING SHAPED CRAFT THAT MADE NO NOISE;2007-08-02 21:00:00;10 MIN.;SEVERAL SMALL CRAFT WITH VERY LARGE WING SHAPED CRAFT THAT MADE NO NOISE ON 08/02/07 AT APPROXIMATLY 9:30 PM I WENT OUTSIDE AND NOTICED A STRING LIKE FORMATION OF LIGHTS, THEY APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 5 MILES AWAY AND LOW ON THE HORIZON. I CONTINUED TO WATCH THINKING THEY MIGHT BE HELICOPTERS FROM A NEAR BY MARINE CORPS BASE, THEN THEY STARTED MOVING INTO STRANGE FORMATIONS,THIS IS WHEN I DECIDED TO GET MY BUDDY NEXT DOOR TO LOOK AT IT. WE WATCHED FOR ANOTHER TWO MINUTES THEN IT REALLY GETS STRANGE. IT APPEARED THAT THEY WERE TURNING TOWARD US WHEN ALL THE LIGHTS SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR,SECONDS LATER WE NOTICED WHAT LOOKED TO BE ONE LARGE OBJECT COMING STRAIGHT TOWARDS US FROM THE SAME LOCATION. THE OBJECT MOVED VERY SLOW, TOO SLOW FOR WINGED AIRCRAFT,AS IT MOVED DIRECTLY OVER US IT APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 5,000 TO 10,000 FEET UP, IT WAS SHAPED,AS BEST I COULD TELL,LIKE A BIG WING WITH LONG WHITE LIGHTS NEAR THE OUTER TIPS,THE LIGHTS WENT BACK AND FORTH THEY DID NOT FLASH.THE OBJECT HAD TO BE AS WIDE AS A FOOTBALL FIELD OR MORE JUDGING BY ALTITUDE.HERE'S THE COOLEST THING! NO NOISE! ALL WE COULD HEAR WAS A GENTLE SWOOSH SOUND LIKE SOMETHING VERY LARGE PUSHING AIR. IT WAS HEADING SOUTH, WENT PAST US A FEW MILES THEN TURNED NORTHEAST AND FLEW OUT OF SIGHT. I NOR MY FRIEND HAVE EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT,IT WAS REALLY UNBELIEVABLE.IF ANYONE ELSE SAW THIS OR ANYTHING THAT IS LIKE THIS PLEASE POST;35.1060208333332;-77.0700249999999
