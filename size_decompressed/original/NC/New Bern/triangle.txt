Triangular shape, with yellow lights in each corner.;2014-09-17 20:50:00;3 minutes;Triangular shape, with yellow lights in each corner. I live in New Bern, NC, and I saw a UFO On the evening of September 17th, at 8:50 pm..   My son and I had just returned home from church, when my son pointed up and said “ something very very big is in the sky!  When I looked up, I saw a large dark triangular mass blocking out the sky.  Its dimensions were 300 feet by 200 feet.  The only color you could see was a yellow light at each corner of the triangle.   The mass moved very slowly and if you weren't paying attention it would just look like a dark night out because the mass was almost camouflaged in the sky.  It didn’t make any sound and headed in a south west direction. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite credible.  We suspect that she is a reliable witness.  PD));35.1060208333332;-77.0700249999999
