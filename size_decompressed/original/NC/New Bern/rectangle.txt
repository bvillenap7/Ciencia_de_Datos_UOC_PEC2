Strange lights seen above highway 70 New Bern, NC.;2015-05-11 00:55:00;3-4 minutes;Strange lights seen above highway 70 New Bern, NC. While my wife and I were traveling on hwy 70 west, between the towns of Havelock and New Bern, NC, we noticed above the tree line on the right hand side of the road what we original thought were the lights of one of those cell phone towers that you see everywhere, and we subsequently noticed a small red light that appeared to be flashing slowly between the two original white lights.   It was raining that night with cloudy overcast and the cloud ceiling was low.  We continued traveling for an additional 1-2 minutes, then in about the same area but this time only about what seemed to be only 50-100 feet above the tree line.  This time what we saw although not specifically seeing the shape of a rectangle due to the weather we saw what looked like a sequence of white lights on what would have been the front of this thing.  Plus it looked like it remained fairly still as if hovering.  However when we opened the car window to listen we heard no sound.   And there was something about the lights they looked somehow bigger than conventional aircraft landing lights, and we did not see any other red or green lights coming from the craft in what would have been landing type lights. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he and his wife are very good witnesses.
