Flashing, stationary type light;2008-04-30 23:08:00;?;Flashing, stationary type light Object was in the sky very far away in our nothern sky. The appox. time was 23:08. My husband discovered it. After watching for about 10 minutes came in to the house to get me to come out and look also. As we watched and discussed it. I decided to contact you. We sit out on our porch just about every evening and have never seen this. We pondered if it was a star because it was so far away.  We could not come to a conclusion what we are seeing. It had a flashing red, green and blues light. That seemed to twinkle. We determined it was not an airplane, because it stayed in the same area. We do not know or have an explaination as to what we were seeing. I tried to take several pictures with no luck. I have them saved on my digital camera. Don't know how much help it would be. Maybe someone saw or reported what we saw also.;35.1060208333332;-77.0700249999999
