Morphing triangle into jet, Jupiter-bright object heads NE nearby during jet chase.;2010-04-28 20:50:00;5 minutes;Morphing triangle into jet, Jupiter-bright object heads NE nearby during jet chase. Two jets chased a triangular UFO which had the three circular lights in the corners and one in the center, which morphed into a jet, all the while an object as bright as Jupiter was steadily hovering off to their left of the fighter-pilots in the opposite direction (NE).  Then before the bright object blended into the sky i saw another object of equal brilliance heading South a little ways off from where the first object was headed.  They both blended into the sky and the jets went off on a tangent from their original circular lap they make from time to time over my workplace. 4/27/10 three jets were on the same lap about the same time but they did not deviate from it and came full circle to return to base.

It had a brite, aluminated shine & On Thursday morning, at 7:52 am, I took five pictures with my cell phone of a very, very, very fast, soundless, elongate silver with rings in front and back.  It had a brite, white, aluminated shine from it.  As it moved, its shape seemed different at different times.  I will save this text somehow and try to post pictures.   I heard NO SOUNDS.;35.1060208333332;-77.0700249999999
