Large orange circle appearing and moving across the sky at high rate of speed;2012-08-03 22:30:00;2 minutes;Large orange circle appearing and moving across the sky at high rate of speed I was sitting on the back stairs talking on the phone, when I saw a bright flash of light.  I looked up, and saw a bright, yellow/orange ball of light in the sky that had not been there previously.  As I sat and watched this, it  started  going in a slow circle, then flew off at a speed no aircraft could match. I was the only witness as far as I know.  There was no sound made by the object, the color remained solid and unchanging.  It was large in size, bigger then a plane, if I had to guess is say it was several hundred yards in diameter. I was not intoxicated or under the influence of any substance.  I am familiar with meteors, couple space craft and aircraft, this was 100% none of those. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded quite sober-minded to us.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));35.1060208333332;-77.0700249999999
2 red, silent, flying orbs;2012-10-13 23:30:00;2 minutes;2 red, silent, flying orbs It was about 11:30pm 10/13/2012 (New Bern, NC)  I was outside finishing rigging fishing gear and tackle.  I live next to a golf fairway and was test casting a new pole/rod on the fairway.  I had a totally clear wide open view.  The conditions were 100% clear, no clouds, no wind, all stars visible.  Totally clear skies. I saw two bright, really bright red lights/orbs fly or glide over the tree line and approach my location.  My best guess on altitude would be 500 - 1000 ft.   I had a bright orange streetlight as reference about 100yds from me and these lights were hundreds of times brighter and much more red in color.  The lights were flying South sort of in formation with one orb at the 12 o'clock position and the other to the left at about 7 o'clock position they flew with zero sound, noise and had no tails or trail of any kind.  I could hear and see another over head plane, but these lights flew silent. I had view of the lights for probably 2 minutes as they flew slowly towards me.  The lights seemed to momentarily stop and then change direction.  The lights started flying west, upward and much faster until they glittered out and disappeared. It was truly surreal.;35.1060208333332;-77.0700249999999
Bright light in the sky.;2015-07-10 23:10:00;5 seconds;Bright Light in the Sky My son asked me pick him up from second shift.  I left the house and he called my cell phone to say he wasn't ready.  My husband was grouchy and sitting next to me in the car.   As I was talking to my son I felt a pang in my eyes from an extremely bright light.  I looked ahead on the road to see if I needed to dim my headlights for another car but the angle was wrong so I looked up.  There was a bright white circle jetting across the sky. It wasn't too close but I could tell it was large.   The light did not blink and it moved amazingly fast at a curved angle.  I could not distinguish any rotation.  There was no trail behind it and I didn't hear any noise.  It wasn't any kind of spotlight.   I was talking to my son and I pointed to my husband urgently.  I asked did you see that light but he hadn't seen me pointing because it was dark. There was complete cloud cover over the road I was traveling.  You couldn't see any stars.  It was a good bit above the tree line but it had to be flying low enough to be under the cloud cover.   I looked in the local paper to see if anyone else had noticed it or written about it but I haven't heard anything.  It made me so excited but also made my stomach ache.   I know I saw something AMAZING.   I was really disappointed my husband didn't see it because I would have liked to share the excitement with him...so I'm sharing it with you guys instead.
