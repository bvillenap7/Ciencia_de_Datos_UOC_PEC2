I found that interesting because I have never seen that.    It was still daylight outside, I happened to look up and notice the beautiful bright full moon.  The sky was clear.  A few moments later, from the northeast and moving extremely fast, I saw a UFO that seemed to be as bright as the moon.  It did not slow down.  It kept on moving and headed southeast.  It looked like it moved right under the moon.   It appeared to be oval in shape and a similar color as the moon.;35.1060208333332;-77.0700249999999
