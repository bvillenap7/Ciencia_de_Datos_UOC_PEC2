Saw more than 5 Orange Orbs in the Night sky.;2017-10-22 19:20:00;~5 minutes;Saw more than 5 Orange Orbs in the Night sky. Looked up and saw 3 orange lights/orbs in a triangular formation, not a perfect triangle though.  There were 4 more off to the left, no particular formation, possibly another one to the right, not sure because of the trees.  They were all moving slowly and vertically. Was in my car and had I had my window down.  There was no noise.  There were no other lights, like flickering light you see on planes.  I got home and grabbed my camera but they had disappeared by then.  Completely gone.  I turned and faced my house and saw another one. It was moving horizontally this time. It was going slow at first, then went really fast and disappeared.;34.9508;-78.9381
