Seen apparent shooting star bounce off of object in sky changing its trajectory.;2019-11-05 03:00:00;5 seconds;Seen apparent shooting star bounce off of object in sky changing its trajectory. I drive a route from Fayetteville, NC, to Florence, SC, starting at 2:30 AM, five days a week. When driving south on I95 at this time, I see shooting stars frequently, about 2 per week. One day I seen a shooting star when I was about near the Hope Mills area, before the St. Pauls exit.  This was in the southeast sky, to my left as I was driving south.  It was unusual this time because it suddenly changed direction, as if it had bounced off of a solid object in the atmosphere.  I would guess the trajectory changed by about 65 degrees, bouncing back and changing its direction, while still descending.  It was all pretty fast, about 5 seconds, and faded like shooting stars do eventually. I was driving and was not able to record anything. I have been thinking about it, and am finally reporting it because it is bothering me. Did it bounce off of something- and if so what?  There was nothing subsequent to this, such as a plane crashing.;34.9508;-78.9381
