Brightly lit UFO seen in Hope Mills during daylight hours.;2014-02-06 18:10:00;30 seconds;Brightly lit UFO seen in Hope Mills during daylight hours. Leaving the Millstone 14, my wife and I were waiting at the stop light that leaves the shopping complex.  Behind the stop light is a wood line.  Waiting for the light to turn green, we see a brightly glowing disc shaped object ascend several hundred feet while slightly wobbling.  At the peak of its ascent, it curved quickly to the my left and darted off.  The light turned green and I immediately pulled over after about 150ft. at a gas station to see if I could continue to observe it.  At that point it was nowhere in sight.
