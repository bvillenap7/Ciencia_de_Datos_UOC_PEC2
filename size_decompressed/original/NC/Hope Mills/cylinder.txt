I was standing at the bus stop, looked up and saw what looked like a rocket at first, coming down from up in the sky and it stopped in mid-air.  It was shaped like a cylinder and it slowly drifted from our view to our right until it was out of view. It was only one object and it was silver in color.  The background was clear sky and there were trees, but the object was way above the trees.;34.9508;-78.9381
