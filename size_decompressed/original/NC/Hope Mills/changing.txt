See emailed photos;2006-03-15 04:00:00;1 hour +/-;See emailed photos I awoke about 4 AM on March 15th 2006 to see a brighter and larger than normal orangey-yellowish star like object and somewhat elongated vertically just above the horizon at about 15 degrees. The sky was very clear and virtually cloudless. I was looking SE. The object, though small seemed to be changing shape and occasionally a red dot appeared at the top. After watching for ½ hour, I went outside with my 3.5 digital camera and took two photos. I returned to bed and watched as the object slowly rose over a period of about one hour to about 45 degrees. I then went back to sleep.  On March 16th, I opened the photos in my computer and blew them up to reveal two unusual exposures which I believe to be UFO’s? I have emailed them to you.;34.9508;-78.9381
