Orange stationary orbs accompanied by small white objects moving at extraordinary speed.;2010-04-12 21:30:00;20 minutes;Orange stationary orbs accompanied by small white objects moving at extraordinary speed. Over ocean. Orange circular lights appearing singularly, two at a time, and three grouped tightly on one quick viewing.  Stationary in the sky, illuminated for as long as 15 seconds and as little as 3 seconds.  Orange orbs appeared miles apart accompanied by white, star-like looking objects moving in tandem at extremely high speed.  Bright white objects not moving in symetrical patterns but seemed to be taking cues from the movement of one another.  Orange orbs and much smaller bright white objects were on horizon simultaneously but having no overt interaction.  Never seen anything like this in my life. Inexplicable.;33.8797;-78.5191
