Strange noises;2012-10-24 20:00:00;45 minutes;Strange noises Sounded similar to several military aircraft with afterburners lit the entire duration. Several instances where you could see what appeared to be flares being released from an unseen aircraft.  The 'flares' started white in color and changed to orange then disappeared after 8-10 seconds.  This all occurred East of where I was standing, placing the event over the Atlantic.
