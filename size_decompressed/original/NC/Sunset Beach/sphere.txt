Orange/Red Light pulsing over ocean;2011-06-08 21:30:00;15 minutes;Orange/Red Light pulsing over ocean Went for a night walk about 9:30 on sunset beach and witnessed a couple of light above the horizon off the coast.   It started with just a couple orange red light, the glow itself almost looked like it was flashing.  More like a light you see from a signal from a lighthouse that is turning,bright for a second and then you cannot see it again.   Over the next 15 or so minutes, the lights would show up in groups of two and sometimes up to 10 or 15 in a wide area.   Some did not appear to be moving, while others seemed to be moving in a straight line.   Often the lights would be in a grouping, some very close to the point where it appeared they we splitting in two.  It very much reminded me of watching lightning bugs on a summer night.   After watching the lights for a period of time, traditional military jet formations lights were seen, small plans moving at high speed, with traditional flight lights grouped together.   It was very windy that night with the winds blowing i! n from the ocean.   At one point a couple of the group heard a helicopter as well, but the plane lights and helicopter sound did not occur until after the lights had disappeared.;33.8797;-78.5191
