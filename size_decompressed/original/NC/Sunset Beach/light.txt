Mysterious Lights witnessed over Sunset Beach, NC;2009-09-15 22:00:00;20 minutes;Mysterious Lights witnessed over Sunset Beach, NC There were four of us (professional adults - ages 30-40) sitting on a deck atop a house on Sunset Beach, NC, looking in the direction of the ocean.  We all witnessed three orange lights appear in the sky first in a triangle formation and then as the lights would disappear, the lights would then appear again in a horizontal formation but only one light appearing at a time and as one light would appear then disappear another light would appear to the right of the first light.  There were three lights that would appear in that type of formation.  We witnessed these light appear in this manner 4 times and all in different elevations in the sky but in the same general area.  There is a group of stars that are in a formation resembling the number 7. We witnessed these lights appearing around the middle - bottom of this star formation.;33.8797;-78.5191
Lights (sparkling diamond shaped) appeared in the sky over Atlantic Ocean in North Carolina, 12-10-12.;2012-12-10 19:00:00;10 minutes;Lights (sparkling diamond shaped) appeared in the sky over Atlantic Ocean in North Carolina, 12-10-12. On December 10, 2012 at approximately 7:50 pm, 5 members of a family wish to report unusual lights that appeared to be moving, traveling and bouncing in the atmosphere above the seashore (Atlantic Ocean) at Sunset Beach NC.  I am a teacher from this area and the other family members are also from this area and blue collar workers.  We were standing on the second floor balcony of our home, overlooking the intercostal waterway and the ocean beyond, looking at the night sky after dinner. The sparkle lights moved about, heading away towards the North East then came back towards the West closer towards us.  These lights were high up in the atmosphere and did not appear to be any type of aircraft any of us had ever seen.  This light show continued randomly within this area several minutes and then several (3) of them seemed to bust or expand into a bright amber colored star or diamond shape and white star light shapes.  A few minutes later, this process began again but! with fewer lights and a few more were to explode into golden star light also.  After this they didn't appear anymore.  I would like to know if any other reports of this nature were reported in this area.;33.8797;-78.5191
