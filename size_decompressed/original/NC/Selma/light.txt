Six aircraft moving at high rates of speed in an acrobatic formation then dissapearing in a star burst;1986-10-22 22:00:00;07 minutes;Six aircraft moving at high rates of speed in an acrobatic formation then dissapearing in a star burst I was out watching the stars with my mother and sisteron or about the 22 of October 1986. Around 22:00 I noticed a quick streak that looked like a metor. It went from east to west. What caught my attention was that when it was directly overhaed it stopped.It was very small like a small star.I could see four other similar size objects in a circle like patten extending to the horizon It was similar to a clover exit ramp on the interstate. About seven minutes passed and two more lights appeared. One from the north and the other the south.They crossed the sky in less thn a second and stopped where the first light was directly overhead. The four that were doing thier circles joined sith the others. They the shot out in what looks like a super nova and dissapeared. There was no noise. I had my mother call Seymore Johnson AFB in Goldsboro to see if they had picked up anything on radar. She said the did not have any aircraft on radar. I do not know if they took a report or not.;35.5596999999998;-78.2622000000002
