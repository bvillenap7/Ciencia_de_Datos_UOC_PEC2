As it crossed in front of me, it went from bright to dim to bright.  It was moving from west to east horizontally at great speed.  Lost sight of object due to Forrest.   In my 20 plus years of trucking never encountered an object like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
