Object moving with great speed noticed on video playback;2021-07-04 20:33:00;1 second;Object moving with great speed noticed on video playback On July 4th, 2021 at 2033 I used my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 to record a person light and fire a roman candle fire cracker in slow motion. I thought nothing of it and continued my day.  I had no alcohol and saw/heard nothing unusual in the sky.  I was facing south south east.  When I returned home, I played the video back on my phone and zoomed into the person firing the roman candle to see how the slow motion looked. I noticed a small dark  object above the people moving left to right.  I zoomed in with my fingers by pinching the screen, and watched the dark object go from left to right across the entire screen within one second of real time.  I watched it several times.  I do not know how far away it was but it appeared to be further than some trees in the background. It was moving very fast and it (appeared) was very small.  I thought it could have been an insect but the flight path was very controlled with no zig zagging. I thought it may have been a bird but it was not possible for a bird to fly that fast.  I enhanced the video and made it easier to see but I still could not make it out.  The moving image is very blurry and has some light around it but that could be pixelation.;36.4535;-76.3055
