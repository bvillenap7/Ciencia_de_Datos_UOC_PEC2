Large group of orange orbs.;2018-12-22 18:30:00;5 minutes;large group of orange orbs I was driving down US highway 64 East, when I noticed 7 orange lights flying in formation.  They crossed the 4 lane and I pulled off the highway to see better.  Other cars also pulled off and got out looking at the objects.  No blinking just solid orange lights.  I took a video of 3 of the objects and someone yelled out another group was coming across the highway.  I saw then but did not video as my phone camera quit working.  Next there were several helicopters coming and I could hear the helicopters not the orange objects, no sound from the groups of objects.;35.8928;-77.5406
