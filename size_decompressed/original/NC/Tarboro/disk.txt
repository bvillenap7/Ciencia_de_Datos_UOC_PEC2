Friend and I observed one disc-shaped, dark metallic object that had three separate lights fixed by equal distance underneath unknown aerial object. Object first sighted coming out of the east, then slowly descended into a large wooded area where we could see lights between trees. When object came overhead it was about 500' to 750' above ground. Glow of underneath lights (red, green,and white) highlited outline of object.We first observed object after exiting my home. After passing overhead to settle/land in woods nearby (300-400 yards west of home). Lights observed shining inside tree-line. We stood out in vacant field watching this yellow to white glow when we then noticed smaller twinkling white lights zig-zagging in and outside of the treeline. We ran back towards home when we observed strange person floating near creek, Time noted at home arrival- 7:30PM. Light source in treeline was seen for almost 2 weeks. (Every night I'd strangly be drawn down to watch that light).;35.8928;-77.5406
it was as large as our house...and silent enough no one inside heard a thing...nor did i;1983-10-01 21:00:00;3 minutes;it was as large as our house...and silent enough no one inside heard a thing...nor did i My brother and I were out in the front of our home I was 9 or 10.  I don't recall the approach only the fear we both felt when it was over us.  We both ducked under my mom's car and then after what SEEMED like a few minutes we both looked up.  The saucer was moving away slowly and then quickly glid across the skyline toward the west.  We ran inside and told our parents.  Of course no one believed us and it was a joke with my sisters for years.  After that I realized my parents didn't know everything.  About 15 years later I mentioned it to my brother as we hadn't spoken of it since the week it happened.  He just froze up and said, i'm not supposed to talk about it.  They told me not to.  Although as a child I never doubted what I saw.  His odd behavior made me realize he was a troubled with it as I. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.8928;-77.5406
UFO spotted in my neighborhood.;2002-12-08 21:00:00;2  minutes;UFO spotted in my neighborhood. We had left church to take some girls home. My friend and I were returning to church to get her truck. We were getting ready to turn to go to church when my friend said look what is that? I said it looks like a UFO. She said I thought so too. So we kept going straight to it to get a closer look. We got closer and it looked like a saucer shape and had lights and looked like it was spinning and blinking it had a circle around it. It kind of sat in the sky blinking and spinning. We got closer and it went down behind some trees. We waited then started to leave and it came back up for a split second and then was gone. It was a weird feeling. I have never seen anything like that. It was not a plane because it was too big and it wasn't moving at first.;35.8928;-77.5406
