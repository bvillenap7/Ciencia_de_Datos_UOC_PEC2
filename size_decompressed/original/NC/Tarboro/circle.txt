I video taped it.;2018-03-04 00:00:00;10 minutes;I video taped it. On 3/4/2018, while working in my shed, I heard the dog bark.  I stepped out the shed to see what he was barking at.  As I stood there, I looked into the sky, I saw what looked like a plane/helicopter go strait towards this light and then disappear.  I said to myself that looks weird so I grabbed my cell phone to start recording my phone was to low for video so I ran inside I got my wife's phone and ran back out side and started recording.  It appear to me that something was shooting at it.  I video taped it and at one point you see it flash in a big glow then move.  This is the first sighting I have seen.  A few nights before that I was picking something up off the floor in the shed and I looked up and I saw a white face with black eyes looking thru the shed at me.  I stepped out the shed thinking it might of been one of my kids playing with me, but no one was there but I felt like someone was watching me.   When I went back in the shed it felt like something kept trying ! to plull down my pants and seems like something pinched me and I kind of loss awareness then I came too.  I felt kind of odd like something had happen I did notice some scars on my hand and back.  But I just ignored it.;35.8928;-77.5406
