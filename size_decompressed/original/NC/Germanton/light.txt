Bright circular light in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-14 22:15:00;~3 minutes;Bright circular light in the sky. I was watching the meteor shower, and all of a sudden, a light rises up and it looked like it sat there for a minute.  Then it moved in a zigzag pattern, then moved in a straight line and it kinda sounded like a plane, but a bit quieter.  It looked white and it was a circular light.  There was only one that I seen.   I went to take a picture of it on my phone and then my phone shut off and died. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.2699;-80.2267
