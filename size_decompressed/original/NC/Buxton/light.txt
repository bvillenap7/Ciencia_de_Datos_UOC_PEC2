Sitting on semi ocean front property in Buxton, NC on August 7th 2012 around 9:15 at night, looked up in a southernly direction following a faint light moving south over the ocean. Light turned bright (resembled a plane headlight coming towards land) maybe a few hundred in the air, then it split into 2 lights, same size, then split in three, the first light disappeared, then the second disappeared and the third light turned from a yellowish orange to red and flew off. About 5 seconds later it reappeared, farther south and did the exact same thing. Both times they alined in a perfect line, evenly spaced. You could see a main craft flying in front/behind them. Lasted a few seconds. Neighbors saw as well. 5 witnessed it in all. Fighter jets have been flying over head for the last 2 days, been wondering what's up.;35.2714;-75.5443
