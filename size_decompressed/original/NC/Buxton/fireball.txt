Round flaming balls moving sporadically across The Point on Hatteras Island Beach;2010-04-15 21:30:00;30 - 40 mins;Round flaming balls moving sporadically across The Point on Hatteras Island Beach My family and I were fishing on the beach at the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse when my mom spotted five lights right above the horizon when i saw them they seemed to linger around in a weird formation for a second then just disappeared.  So we went onto fishing and i pulled my phone out and when i did my mom yelled look and when i looked over there were three lights moving around very weirdly and strange. For thirty minutes we saw them disappear and appear. When we no longer saw the lights there were vehicles that seemed to drive around on the beach about a mile down from us with their lights on without going anywhere.  There would be 1 then 5 then 3 and they just showed up.  So the location of the lights in the sky then the weird vehicles there is no way it could have been ships or trucks fishing not the way they appeared like that.
