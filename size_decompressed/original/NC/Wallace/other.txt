My friend and I were laying on the ground outside of another friends house. There was nothing to do so we decided to just look at the stars and talk about stuff. As we layed there, a boomerang shaped object approached from the right side of us. It had five lights on it. The lights on the object were perfect circles. They were dim, orange, yet a little yellow. At first I was shocked by the object, then I realized it must be a UFO. I shook my friend, however, it was like he was in a deep sleep. I turned my head back up to the object and it grew into four fingerlike objects, but yet they were all conjoined at the climax. Now the object had twelve lights. All of them were still the same color and the same form. There were three lights on each fingerlike connector. There was no sound while this object passed us. It gracefully passed by as if it was trying to sneak by. Then it shot into the sky leaving a brightly colored trail behind it. No sound at all. Finally my friend woke up and i asked him if he saw it. He said no and that he was asleep.;34.7505;-77.9413
