Black chevron triangle with 5 dim circular lights/city block size/silent, flying tree top level;2008-07-01 21:30:00;10 seconds;Black chevron triangle with 5 dim circular lights/city block size/silent, flying tree top level A friend and I were laying in the backyard talking about life, looking at the stars. He fell asleep after about 10 minutes, so I layed staring at the stars.  A black chevron shaped ufo came from the right of us.  It was tree top level and completely silent.  It appeared the size of our city block. It had 5 lights, all perfectly circular, dim and orange colored.  As it flew over I reached for my phone, pushing my friend to wake up.  By the time I got his attention and looked left in the direction it was flying, it disappeared over the police station.  I did see a very bright light on the left side of the police station, I did not know if it flew off quickly or kept cruising along. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
