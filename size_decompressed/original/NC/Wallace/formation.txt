I;2006-05-01 00:00:00;1 min;In 2006, myself and a co-worker were on our way home.  When we turned on our road, I noticed a formation of lights over a set of trees.  I decided to ignore until the person I was with said, Hey, do you see that.   So i took another glance and we stopped the truck.  What I saw seemed to be 3 lights in a wide triangle form going off in what seemed to be a pattern.  After about 30 seconds, the lights darted what had to be miles across the sky at unknown speed.  After another 10 seconds of the lights going off, they darted across the sky again, this time out of sight.   I have tried to report this to MUFON but got the run around.  What made me want to report this story was a documentary on the discover channel.  A man from Fayetteville, N,. (45mins away) from this sighting saw the same exact thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.7505;-77.9413
