There was a massive, and I mean massive, black triangular UFO that was hovering over the old Wal-mart parking lot (which is right behind the KFC, you can see this in Google maps hopefully) and moving at about 4-5 mph away from us going towards the tree line at the far end of said parking lot.  We just stared in amazement. It was so black it silhouetted itself against the night sky.  It had 3 (possibly 4 in total) really dim blue lights at each end.  The back end was slightly larger so it wasn’t equilateral. It was pure silent. It didn’t look like it should have the ability to fly, much less hover and move at a walking pace.  We could only watch as it made its way past the tree line until it disappeared from our view.  It was so low to the ground if I was underneath it I could have thrown a rock and hit it. It was barely higher than the trees.  There were no cars around.  This was a small rural town. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));34.7505;-77.9413
