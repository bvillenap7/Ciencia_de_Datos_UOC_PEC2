On Thursday November 14th 2019 I witnessed in the north-west quarter of the sky one single craft. It was moving very slowly toward the south-west quarter of the sky. It was around 11:00P.M. eastern time. There were no flashing lights, only one single light that was not very bright. The craft was very high up in the sky and I could not make out any shape. The single dim light stopped in the sky at about due west. The light then seemed to turn bright as if it turned toward my position. It seemed to turn several times going from dim to bright while holding the same position in the sky. I did not have anything to take pictures or video. I was in my backyard at the time and wanted to see what happened if I moved. When I moved it seemed the light turned toward me and became very bright. Then it sped of toward the south â€“ west quarter of the sky and was out of sight in the snap of a finger. I have never witnessed anything that flew that fast in my life. We do live in the fly Zone of a military base, but this was no military aircraft. This was extremely fast and made no sound. The entire event only lasted about 2 minutes. When it left it was out of sight in 2 seconds.;35.2238;-79.669
