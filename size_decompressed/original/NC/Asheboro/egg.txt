Grey object, 5 miles north of Asheboro Airport, moving rapidly and changing directions at extreme angles.;2016-10-27 10:00:00;4-7 seconds;Grey object, 5 miles north of Asheboro Airport, moving rapidly and changing directions at extreme angles. One object observed 5-6 miles (estimated) north of Asheboro Airport.  Appeared to be grey in color, and shaped between an egg, saucer, and cigar.  I don't think it changed shape, but possibly viewed from different angles.   It was against a background of dark grey  clouds.  I first saw it moving from west to east, then it appeared to go straight up then back towards the west at a downward angle to approximately the same altitude as it was when I first saw it.  The turns and change of directions were abrupt, and at very sharp angles.   I lost sight of it at this point as it either went into the clouds or faded away.  The horizontal distance it moved is difficult to estimate, bit I would put it at least 3-4 miles west to east.;35.710215712188;-79.8075911894264
