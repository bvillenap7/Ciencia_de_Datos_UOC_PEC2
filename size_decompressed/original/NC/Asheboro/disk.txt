It had lights on the top that appeared to be red in color.  And white lights on the side.   When I came out of my house, I saw a slow moving object to the north of my house and then it took a westerly turn and was gone.  I also saw a small plane that came from the south.   Although there was only one craft observed, it really scared me.   The craft made a soft, but high-pitched, chirp as it moved.  And it is unknown if this craft landed or not.;35.710215712188;-79.8075911894264
