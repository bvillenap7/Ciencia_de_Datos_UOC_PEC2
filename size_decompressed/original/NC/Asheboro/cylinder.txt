Large, shiny, motionless cylinder.;2003-04-01 17:00:00;2 to 3 min;Large, shiny, motionless cylinder. It has been sometime since I have seen this, but the thought of it has stayed with me.  Driving home from work (South on US220) I saw in the SSE sky what appeared to be a very large and shiny cylinder.  It appeared to be at a fairly high altitude (my best guess between 25,000 and 40,000 feet).  If my height guesstimate is correct then I would guess the length to be between 300 and 600 feet (this is based on what a commercial airliner looks like at cruising altitude).  The length to diameter ratio was probably between 4 and 5.  The sky was totally clear, and the sun was at a late afternoon angle so the object was reflecting greatly.  I'm sure it wasn't some reflection/glare from my windshield, because the car was shaded by the trees along the road.  During the entire time I was watching, the object did not appear to move at all.  After I took my exit, which is basically a clover leaf, I was unable to find the object again.  My first thought when I saw it was that it was a sattelite reflecting the low angle sunlight, but it was just too large.  Like I said, this image has really stayed with me.
