Silver Cigar Shaped object at high altitude moving West.;2009-01-01 17:00:00;3-4 min.;Silver Cigar Shaped object at high altitude moving West. I was in my yard when a reflection (flash) caught my eye through the trees in my yard.  When I first saw the object it was directly above me at high altitude moving slowly across the sky to the West.  It was a highly reflective silver color and shaped like a cigar. I'm going to take a guess it was at least 40-50 thousand feet up.  There was no sound or contrail.  I couldn't see any wings or control surfaces of any kind. jet's fly over daily at high altitude but I can always make out the wings as well as the body of the jet.  Also, I can always hear the engines on a high altitude jet.  I lost sight of the object because of the trees on my property but it appeared to be  on a steady course due West.;35.710215712188;-79.8075911894264
