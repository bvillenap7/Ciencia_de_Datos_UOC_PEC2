Four lights in a square formation, to the left and just below the North Star.;2017-01-13 03:00:00;1-2 minutes;On Friday 01/13/2017, at approximately 3 a.m., I was loading the car for at weekend trip, walking back in for more items to put into the car.  I was facing north.  I looked up at what I believe was the North Star because of its position in the sky and brightness. From my viewpoint, I saw four lights in a square formation, to the left and just below the North Star.  They were only as bright as evening stars and constant, not blinking or flickering.  I watched them as they move in formation from the right side of the North Star to the left side.  They stayed in a square, for the most part, moving simultaneously closer to each other then away from each other making the square smaller then again larger.  While doing this, they did change places, moving from corner to corner in a clockwise direction. The west to east movement of the formation ended when at the lower right hand corner light moved out further away from being square, the only time the formation was not square.  Then all four of the lights disappeared at the same time. I did not time how long it was, but estimate it was about one to two minutes in duration.  The lights were high in the sky and my view was not obstructed when they disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be eloquent and serious-minded.
