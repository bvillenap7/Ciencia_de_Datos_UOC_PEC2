5 white orbs traveling across the night sky;2019-05-28 22:00:00;1 minute;5 white orbs traveling across the night sky While staying in a cabin on Plott Balsam Mountain near the Smokey Mountains and Maggie Valley, NC,  we were sitting by the camp fire star gazing and looking for satellites, when we noticed a bright white orb enter the atmosphere closely followed by 4 more white orbs.   They were moving roughly South to North in a straight line at the same speed and evenly spaced, they were also the same size.  They all remained together at a constant speed and the brightness never dimmed.  We watched them for a minute or so when we finally lost sight of them.  We discussed the event for a while together and are convinced that what we witnessed was without a doubt, a group of UFOâ€™s.  We never felt threatened by the event and in fact feel blessed that we were able to see them.;35.5238;-83.0911
