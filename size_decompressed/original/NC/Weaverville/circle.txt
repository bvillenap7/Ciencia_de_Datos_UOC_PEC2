I was traveling north on 19-23 at 11:17 pm on October 24. It was between mile marker 26 and 24. I saw a ball of bright white light  plummeting at approximately a 45 degree angle, very fast. The ball was not perfectly defined--it appeared  to have motion, whirling, with bright light coming out of it. There was a white tail. The ball of light was about  three-quarters to a full size of what would be considered an ordinary full moon.  In the instant before the ball disappeared from sight, about a third of the length of the tail (the portion of the tail closest to the ball) displayed colors as in a spectrum, in distinct, separate bands of distinct colors, being of fairly wide breadth. The bands of color were perpendicular to the tail, not lengthwise. And the rest of the tail remained white.  I heard no crash, there was no display of light as in an explosion, I heard or felt no rumble or shudder. It was just gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));35.7113000000003;-82.5466999999995
Me and 3 friends saw two weird orbs of speeding light to the north and south of weaverville.;2011-12-03 19:15:00;10 minutes;me and 3 friends saw two weird orbs of speeding light to the north and south of weaverville. Me and 3 of my friends were messing around outside when me and one of my friends saw a greenish-blue orb flash across the sky headed south at speeds no earth craft could even imagine reaching so we told my other two friends about it and i went in to get my video camera. About ten minutes later I was messing with my camera when my three friends saw the same looking orb of light shoot down from the sky to the the north of us. They said it looked like it fell from the sky.  After that we did not see anymore activity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Our group witnessed a bright light traveling at and just below cloud level over Weavervile, NC, in the Reems Creek area.  The object made no noise, had no navigational lights, and was not high enough to be a satellite.  We were able to see the object through night vision, and captured it on film.;35.7113000000003;-82.5466999999995
