Bell shaped UFO with lights hovering without sound.;1982-10-08 18:00:00;unknown;Bell shaped UFO with lights hovering without sound. Buncombe County, N.C. It was 1982, I believe in October, and probably within a half hour before the sun went down.  It was on 19-23 at the Jupiter-Barnardsville exit.  The object was not obviously metal and did not reflect light and if I guessed how far off the ground it was I would think roughly 300 ft but no more, and the size was large and if it landed it would have likely took up the width of the median and both sides of the roadway. It was bell shaped and the bottom of it had three lights (I believe 2 blue and 1 red) and shining down from the center was a single white beam of light that was uniform size from where it came out of the object all the way to the ground.  The object was hovering without sound directly above a section of ground between Old Mars Hill Hwy and the ramp that takes vehicles from Jupiter Rd up to 19-23S with the light shining directly down between Old Mars Hill Hwy and the ramp.  There was some dust or vapor that appeared to be moving inside the beam of light. I might not have believed my eyes but there were cars pulled over on both sides of the highway and people were looking at it, the way I would have liked to, but my boyfriend who was driving was so scared he wouldnâ€™t pull over and only slowed down enough to get a good look.  I do not know how long it hovered there. Even now, the guy who is now my ex-husband says that yes he saw something, there were cars pulled over and yes it scared the hell out of him.

Two black helicopters following possible object near Parkway entrance;1999-03-19 16:20:00;forty seconds;Two black helicopters following possible object near Parkway entrance Two black helicopters flying about 200 feet above the ground went across the valley very quickly. I may or may not have seen an object- there was a brief orangish flash that might have been the sun behind the mountian. There was no reason for those helicopters to be in this specific area in this time- I'm reporting this mainly to corraborate an earlier report of black helicopters pursueing a UFO.;35.7113000000003;-82.5466999999995
Two large objects from the east, silent and moving together, diverged and went separate directions.;2013-08-25 22:00:00;5 minutes;Two large objects from the east, silent and moving together, diverged and went separate directions. On Sunday, August 25 at about 10:15 PM, I went outside with my pair of Gen.3 night vision binoculars to view the sky. I live near Asheville, NC.   I saw several shooting stars and a couple of airplanes.   I then noticed, coming out of the east heading west, two brightly lit object that seemed to be pretty high up, perhaps 15 or 20,000 ft.  They were close to one another, and proceeded to move at the same speed and, while maintaining the exact same pace with one another, began to slowly diverge, with one object heading north, the other heading south.  They showed no plane lighting configurations, but seemed to be self-illuminated, of a oval or round shape, with a dark spot at the bottom of each object and another lighted section below the darkened area.  They were silent and had to have been huge in size.  This lasted 4 or 5 minutes.;35.7113000000003;-82.5466999999995
