Cylinder-shaped, silent UFO over Western, NC.;2013-08-25 19:00:00;10-15 seconds;Cylinder-shaped, silent UFO over Western NC This is the second UFO I witnessed in two days.  On Monday, August 25 at around 7:00pm, I walked out of my house to get something from my car.   As I was walking to it, I glanced up and saw what I first thought was an airplane at about 5,000 ft. above my head.  I quickly realized that it had no wings, tail fin or rudder.  It was a metallic, cylinder or tube-shaped object, with no markings except a black band around the center of the object.  It was totally silent, with no contrail or other evidence of propulsion.   It moved across the sky and out of sight within 10 to 15 seconds.  It went from east to west.  It was slow enough to observe in the clear blue sky, but too fast for me to run into the house for a camera.   This was the 4th UFO sighting Iâ€™ve had since 1973, but was the clearest and most dramatic.;35.7113000000003;-82.5466999999995
