At first we thought it was space debris as it was raining and overcast so the stars were completely blocked out.   I know the car ahead of me saw it because they pulled over.   The objects just hovered despite heavy wind.   Never saw anything like it before in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Red sparkiing lights appeared in a dark sky, hovered a few miles from us for about 10 minutes--then blinked out with one flying away.;2017-07-26 22:00:00;10-15 minutes;Red sparkiing lights appeared in a dark sky hovered a few miles from us for about 10 minutes - then blinked out with one flying away. At 10 pm on this moonless night full of stars, I went out on my 2nd story deck looking NE  towards a large dark mountain in the distance.  (We live in the country and there are no visible houses or lights in this direction.)  I first noticed 3 large sparkling red lights.  I assumed they were stars - all in a vertical row in front of this mountain in the valley.  They were not moving but glowing very red.   I called my boyfriend to come look.  We noticed two more red lights rise up behind the trees together side-by-side to a 4th position in the line with one then dropping into a 5th position.  A 6th red light appears at the bottom just over the trees at the end of this vertical line.  Red light number 1 seems to be getting smaller – but does not seem to be moving.  Then it disappears, and the line moves upward.  #2 then disappears, and then # 3 disappears.  A bright red light appears briefly over to the left then also disappears. During this viewing time – maybe 10 -12 minutes – some of the red sparkling lights disappear and then reappear in the same position.  They all appear to be hovering in this valley within a few miles of us. As the other lights just blinked out, the top red light starts to move away to the upper right and gets smaller and smaller, until it is just a dot as if flying away.  It doesn’t just blink out like the others.;35.7113000000003;-82.5466999999995
We saw several orange lights in the western sky NW of Weaverville, NC, around 930 Sunday night, August 5th.;2018-08-05 21:30:00;8 minutes;We saw several orange lights in the western sky NW of Weaverville, NC, around 930 Sunday night, August 5th. My wife and I were walking west on our street around 9:30 tonight.  As we continued we could see an orange glow through the trees.  When the trees cleared we could see several(5-7) orange lights grouped tightly together.  We continued walking and watching the lights and thinking what the hell is that.   We stopped at the cul de sac to see if the lights were moving.  They were slowly moving right in the western sky we think over 1000 feet in the air.  The lights moved away faster but low on the horizon and finally disappeared.  Our guess is that it lasted 8 minutes.   We didn't bring either of our phones.   We came back to the house and I looked up UFO on the internet, and I found your website.;35.7113000000003;-82.5466999999995
