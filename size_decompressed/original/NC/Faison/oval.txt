It was late either a friday or saturday night.  I was at a friends house we had a little get together. I was looking at the sky, and I saw it a white oval bright looking object it flew up straight and seem to disapper.   I told them I think I just saw a UFO fly over the tree line they really didn't believe me.  Then about 10 or 15 mins later.  The object poped up right above us and we all saw a bright flash of light.  I had a weird feeling, when it litterly flashed the area we where at.  It was so fast the flash, it seemed like a giant camera flash from above.  Their was me including three of my friend that saw this.;35.12596;-78.121485
