White reddish light floating rapidly back and forth;2020-01-17 19:00:00;4 hrs;White reddish light floating rapidly back and forth To far to see shape. Close enough to see it wasn’t an airplane. Looked like a star but stars don’t shake back and forth the way this was. Was like when you use that laser toy that you point to the wall and have your cat chase around. One second it’s still, then in a instant it switches position. Very high in the sky. Like if they were observing or simply kicking back. Waved hand to it, stopped its jiggling back and forth immediately. Don’t know if it saw me but it reacts to signals of attention. Disappears instantly. The “star” is no longer there. Color seemed to be white, and a tint of reddish. Hard to believe but definitely not a plane, cause a few planes pass by almost every time I go to this location, and you can definitely tell the difference.;36.1225;-78.6857999999999
