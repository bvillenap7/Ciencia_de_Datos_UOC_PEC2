There was a large hill directly in front of us where we were fishing.  I can't recall who saw the object first.  It looked like a huge barrel tumbling through the air there was no sound or anything the sighting lasted a little over a minute as it pasted over our head to the hill on the other side of the road. I think it was several minutes before we could talk we were in such unbelief.  The next morning I called our radio station to ask if anyone esle had saw anything.  The Radio station said nothing had been reported.  The next day which was Sunday morning I pick up a new paper I can't recall if it was the Winston Salem Journal or the Charlotte Observer and noticed someone else had saw something.  However I didn't report it till now if.  I really do not know what we saw .  Thanks so much for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.1359;-81.1573
