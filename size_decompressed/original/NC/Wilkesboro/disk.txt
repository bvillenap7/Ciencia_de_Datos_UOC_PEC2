Two strange multicolored dancing lights in the sky over Wilkesboro, a third above Deep Gap;2010-01-27 19:00:00;45 mins;Two strange multicolored dancing lights in the sky over Wilkesboro, a third above Deep Gap I've seen them before, so I'm constantly scanning the sky for them. I was driving to Wilkesboro to pick up a friend when I spotted the first two.  They were saucer shaped and flashing white, blue, red, green, and would glow bright amber.  They didn't move much until we were on our way back to Boone. One of them skimmed the horizon, hovering, drifting, close to the mountain tops, before zooming off into the distance.  We drove up to Deep Gap to sky watch, which is where we saw the third.  It was so bright.  I could make out an eclipse of light that hinted at a spherical, not saucer shape.  A white light sometimes flashed red and scanned around the area.  It didn't move much besides a gentle wobble and the occasional dip.  Several planes passed through the air field, but as usual, took no notice of the strange crafts.;36.1359;-81.1573
