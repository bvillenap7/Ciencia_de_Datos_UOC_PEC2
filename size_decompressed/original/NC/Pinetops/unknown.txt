Really strange noises heard.;2013-10-05 04:00:00;15 minutes;Really strange noises heard. Well every night at about 10 me and my girlfriend decide to go outside.  I am a very big believer in UFO's because I have seen plenty of things in the sky I can't quite say what they were.   Well anyways on this particular night It's hot inside so we step outside for a minute. We sit down on the front porch, and just look up at the sky.  Well about 3 minutes after we sit down a strange noise appears.  It sounded like something hovering over the treeline in front of us.  We couldn't see anything though so we thought it may have been a helicopter.  Well seconds later another REALLY strange noise appears.  In the field in front of us it sounds like a laser beam off of a tv sci-fi show, and the neighbors dogs were barking constantly..  Then we hear something sound like it's running across the field.. as well as a big thud like something hit the dog house.  I still can't figure out to this day what it was.  The next day her brother said he woke up because of his dog barking! at 4 a.m. and when he walked outside he heard that hovering noise as well.;35.784;-77.6307
