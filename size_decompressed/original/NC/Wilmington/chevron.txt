I was standing on a picnic table while taking the dog out. I was looking up at the stars when out of nowhere appeared one unidentified flying object. At first I thought it was a shooting star, but then two more appeared and at first I thought, Weill that is odd and then a fourth appeared. They were all a glowing orange in a chevron shape and about the size of large stars. The first three flew in a V, one in front and two on either side and slightly behind. The fourth flew to the right of the three and just before disappearing fell into formation and the four were a diamond. I don't think that they were Earthly crafts because of how fast they flew and the odd orage glow they gave off. Not to mention they appeared to be far away and did not appear nor disappear into a horizon. It was a clear night and they just were there, flew over my head and were gone.

I was shocked and it was so huge as it dissappeared within  the cloudy sky!I was convinced that this was strange but if it were military  couldit fly with no lights in such an eeirie manner?I called my local news station to report this event and to see if anyone had perhaps seen it.No one did not report anything, and I think the station recepient thought I was crazy.

Chevron shaped lights that flashed & disappeared in the northeast sky.;2013-04-01 20:00:00;2 seconds;Chevron shaped lights that flashed & disappeared in the northeast sky. My husband & I were traveling eastbound in northern Wilmington when we witnessed a chevron shaped red & white lights flash in the sky towards the northeast, & then disappear.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but it did not reappear.  My husband asked me if I saw it, & I simply could not believe he had witnessed it too.   The sky was completely cloudless, & it was near dusk.  As we continued our way home, we witnessed another bright flash in the sky out of the corner of our eyes to the north.  It was so quick that I could not discern a shape that time.   I posted on Facebook about seeing it, & one of my neighbors, who lives very close to that area said that she'd witnessed it as well.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
