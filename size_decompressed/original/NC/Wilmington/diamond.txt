A FRIEND AND MYSELF WERE DRIVING HOME ON HWY.132 GETTING READY TO HIT I-40. THERE WAS A TRIANGULAR SHAPE THAT APPEARED FROM NOWHERE IN FRONT OF US IN THE SKY.IT HAD BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS THAT WERE IN A TRIANGULAR SHAPE. THERE WAS NO NOISE AND IT STAYED THERE FOR ABOUT 3-4 MINUTES.I THOUGHT WE WERE CRAZY BUT THERE WAS A TRUCK NEXT TO US THAT HIT HIS BRAKES BECAUSE HE SAW IT TOO. AFTER THE LIGHTS HOVERED A FEW MINUTES THEY JUST SHOT STAIGHT DOWN. I EXPECTED TO SEE FLAMES BECAUSE I FIGUERED IT MAY HAVE BEEN A PLANE CRASHING OR SOMETHING BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. WE GOT HOME AND CALLED THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND TOLD THEM WHAT WE HAD SEEN AND THAT MAYBE THEY NEEDED TO SEE IF SOMETHING HAD WENT DOWN.THEY JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE. I KNOW WHAT I SAW AND I WAS A BIG SKEPTIC BEFORE THAT.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
