There is NO aircraft that can fly that slow, with the exception of a helicopter/glider, and have enough air lift to stay aloft.;1998-06-20 21:30:00;USA/Night sighting;There is NO aircraft that can fly that slow, with the exception of a helicopter/glider, and have enough air lift to stay aloft. The craft was in the shape of a 3 leaf clover, with a globe in the center of the bottom of the craft, which seemed to emit a greenish color. There was a dark thin band which stretched across the craft on the side we could see. The craft was against a night sky, but clearly lit up for myself, my wife, and daughter to see in full detail. The size of the craft could not be determined by us, as there wasn't anything in its background for size comparison. The best estimate I can come up with...the craft was moving at a rate of speed in the neighborhood of 35/40 mph, based on where we first saw it, how long it took to reach a point 1 mile away from us (estimated) then it turned upwards slowly to make its descent, and we lost its track due to our view being obscured by trees. The craft was lit on the top as well, as we could see at the time of its descent. The flight path this craft was flying was obvious it/them was not concerned as to whom saw it, as it was flying directly over one of the more heavily traveled roads in our city. This sighting was reported to 2 local TV stations by my wife, with negative response, which would be the norm. This craft made no sound as it passed us by.......;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
UFO in the vicinity of chemtrail;2005-09-06 11:20:00;5 Min.;UFO in the vicinity of chemtrail I saw an airplane leaving a chemtrail coming over the horizon and got my camera and snapped a picture from the plane and a short piece of chemtrail forward a mile or so.  The UFO (which is easy to see) is quite a way forward of the airplane.  I took the second photo behind the plane showing the UFO above the chemtrail.  I am sending four photographs, one original of each shot and one enlargement of each shot.  There was no focus used in the photos.  The photos were taken in an Easterly direction using an Olympus D-460 ZOOM digital camera. The photos were taken two or three minutes apart.  I did not see the ufos until after I had downloaded the pictures into my computer.  The reason I got my camera and took the photos of the plane leaving the chemtrail is because of previous pictures I have taken of chemtrails and discovering the ufos in the photo. ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the photographs that the witness forwarded to our Center, and we do not know what the anomalous object is.  It is little more than a speck in the sky, and the enlarged version is heavily pixelated.  Hence, we do not know what the object is, and we cannot certify that it is a genuine UFO.

A variety of UFO types seen off  Kure Beach at night.;2011-07-15 21:30:00;10 seconds;A variety of UFO types seen off  Kure Beach at night. My wife and myself love to sit on Kure Beach at evening and into the night.  We like to see the moonlight on the water and also the UFOs.  We have seen many in the past 5 years.  I will relate only 4 which we saw in 2010-2013. 1.  We were about 300 feet or a football field distance from the pier and it was already dark.  Suddenly a bright beam of light appeared above the pier.  It was no more than 100 feet above it.  The beam did not come all the way down to the pier.  It lasted maybe 5 or 6 seconds.  My wife was able to catch a glimpse in the binoculars of two round lights.  Then it was gone, just disappeared.  It left no trail or sound.  There were several people on the pier. 2.  We both saw a bright orb/ufo flying low from the west.  When it reached the ocean, it went upward at increased speed.  It kept going up until we could no longer see it. 3.  On two different occasions, when there was a full moon, we saw an array of lights at ocean level.  They must have been only a mile or so out.  They were different colors and some were moving back and forth and around.  It was like no kind of ship that I know of. It lasted for 20 to 30 minutes and only in one spot. 4.  Two UFOs, lights, were moving overhead toward each other.  We would assume they were at the altitude of a satellite.  They stopped.  One got very bright and then became a thin line with a ball of light at the end.  Then it was gone.  It could be compared to a 'warp jump' from space shows.  The other stayed motionless for a while.   Sal saw it but I missed it because I was trying to find it with binoculars. We have not seen too many lately since we don't go to the beach as much because of my wife's health. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Moon Lander Shaped UFO Stormy day.;2012-05-26 15:00:00;45 minutes;Moon Lander Shaped UFO Stormy day. My son witnessed a flying object that he described as looking like a Moon Lander that was dark in color and had a red pulsing light at the bottom.  It made no noise even though it was about 100ft above him.   He said it was roughly the size of a large car.  He followed it for about 30 minutes before calling us from his cell phone..at which point it flew straight upward and disappeared in the clouds.  He tried to take a picture but it wouldn't show up in his photos.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

Firework sparks in daytime highly reflective glitter bird flock formation closely overhead.;2019-08-03 17:30:00;5 seconds;Firework sparks in daytime highly reflective glitter bird flock formation closely overhead. Dear NUFORC,  First and foremost, I would like to say thank you for the work that you do. It was a lovely, clear Saturday and I was home after directing morning music rehearsals at a local church.  I was elated because the early evening was beatific in its summer breeze. Coming home to perfect summer weather was nice, as our church building has a cold-and-spooky vibe that leaves me drained. I was standing up on my porch, just enjoying the blue sky while my friend sat down to check her texts, when I suddenly saw something 25-50 ft overhead - something that I still cannot explain, as I have found little to no evidence. It was a highly reflective, metallic, glittery, shapeless poof of sparks that resembled blinking stars or fireworks.  The blob was about 5 ft in length, had many sparks, appeared out of thin air and disappeared the same way. Toward the end of its appearance, the sparks seemed to coordinate with one another to  make a formation that reminded me of a flock of birds flying very high overhead, at sunset.  I can definitely confirm that this was not that.  This was especially strange to me, and reminded me that I have a friend who has been researching UFO's for many years, and that she has found that they like to hide by imitating their environment. Back to the event, I was slack-jawed by what I was seeing, yet immediately alarmed my friend who was not able to look up from her screen to see the 2-5 second event.  I would like to add that we were soberly sharing food, and that I don't suffer from any type of hallucinations.  Finally, I was not scared at all by the proximity of this sighting...just blown away.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

I say hi when she answers and step out of my car.  I see a reflection in the grass in my neighbors yard.  I look directly above into the sky and i see these flashing green lights, that are also moving and flowing through the sky, but not leaving the boarder of a hexagon shape.  I started to scream, scaring my friend.  All i could say was lights!! Lights!!! I stare for what feels like a lifetime, then realizing what could happen and that i could be in danger i run back into my car, lock the door, and try to show my friend on face time.  As soon as the camera flips it is gone.  Has anyone else seen this??;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Hovering 30 FT x 20FT craft with a yellow light on either side and 3 vertical red lights in the middle.;2020-10-14 23:30:00;5 minutes;Hovering 30 FT x 20FT craft with a yellow light on either side and 3 vertical red lights in the middle. Subject:  UFO Report:  10/14/2020, 11:30 p.m. EST  To Whom It May Concern:  I left my sister's house on [street name hidden] Way on Wednesday, 10/14/2020 at 11:30 pm EST (23:30 hours).  As I drove down the street, I noticed lights ahead that were hovering over a house and not moving.  I slowed down so I could try to make out what I was seeing.  It was a large object (around 30 FT wide & 20 FT tall) hovering in the sky about roughly 50 feet above the roof of the house directly across the street from the [street name hidden] Way stop sign.  Anyone with a good baseball arm could have thrown a stone and hit it.  As I approached the stop sign, I realized it was a lot bigger than I thought- jet black and I could only make out the outline of the craft against the night sky...there were no other markings that I saw, only the lights and outline. It also made no sound that I could hear.  I did have my windows up, but the neighborhood was completely silent and no one was outside so if it did display an engine-type sound, I should have been able to hear that considering how close I was to this thing (probably around 150 ft away from me).  It had 2 yellow lights on either side of the craft and 3 red lights in the middle. It looked like an upside-down bell but a little wider, more triangle shaped but with rounded edges, and the lights were on the front, not on the side or underneath.  It was very thick...very solid looking--not flat. There was nothing protruding on the craft, no wings or blades. It was very large, as I mentioned before--like the size of my living room w/ vaulted ceilings.  My first thought was this must be a VERY expensive military surveillance drone due to its size but why the heck is it hovering in our community this late at night?!?  It started moving toward me so I floored the gas and sped away as fast as I could. I wasn't sure if it was following me until I turned left on [street name hidden] Ct and there it was.  It was on my left moving VERY slowly over the houses on [street name hidden] Ct. heading in the direction of [school name hidden] High School. I raced down the road and pulled into my garage, jumped out to take a picture of it and it was already gone. I have to tell you, that was the most frightening thing I've ever encountered.  I made a police report the next day (10/15/2020) and the officer confirmed that “none of their drones were outside at time” and “their drones are only 24 INCHES wide.”  I did not take any pics or videos because I was seriously so frightened of being abducted that I could not look away.  I did, however, press my sister’s phone number that is saved on my vehicle’s home screen to call my sister via bluetooth.  She can attest that I was screaming, “Come outside! Come outside!  I think I’m witnessing a UFO!!”  She thought I was joking and hung up.  I’ve included a hand-drawn picture of what I saw.  Thank you for looking into this matter.  If it was military, it is quite concerning that they are in a residential neighborhood flying so close to houses.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
