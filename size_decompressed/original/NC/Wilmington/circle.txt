Unknown length of time of light moving at increbile speed and not a shooting star.;2006-07-10 22:20:00;2 seconds;Unknown length of time of light moving at increbile speed and not a shooting star. I was traveling on 40 east, about exit 416 in North Carolina, and the moon was at 11 o'clock to my point of view and all of a sudden a light came from behind me the origin was not known because all that was seen was through my front winsheild.  It came from behing me and traveling east in the direction I was going.  It was about 12 o'clock from my point of view exactly.  This thing started at the top and ran along down the atmosphere until it looked like it had turned straight away from the earth out towards space.  It was unique and was not a shooting star, this object was bright blue and about twice the size of the brightest star and more intense than the brightest star.  Shooting stars are red!!! And does not last this long and travel that far.  It also was moving at an incredible speed.  As fast as you taking your arm and pointing it at the horizon and move stragiht across the sky to the opposite horizon, taking about one second to completely move your arm.  It did not have a tail but only a light trail that my eyes had to keep up with it. I was a skeptic and still am in some cases, but I have never seen a shooting star do this.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

We had been observing the stars, the ocean, and my two friends were using their metal detector. My female friend and I had decided to sit down and talk, while the other male friend used his metal detector. We both had been looking up towards the sky for about fifteen minutes. I saw an object appear out of no where that looked like a flare in the sky but was very high up, higher than a flare would be and it's color was white, it was very bright and large. After the object flared, it then looked like it disappeared. My friend was talking and I asked her if she saw the same thing. She said she saw something out of the corner of her eye. About five minutes later the object reappeared. My friend and I both saw it together that time. It flared out again, the same white color, it then looked like it disappeared, then it became smaller, it looked circular then and had a slight white luminescent edge around it's circular shape. The middle of the object was dark. We watched it until it finally disappeared which was about a minute or so. We watched the sky for a while then decided to watch the sky as we were walking back to the Sun Spree where we had parked.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
3 unexplained circular lights over the ocean in North Carolina;2008-11-18 18:30:00;45mins;3 unexplained circular lights over the ocean in North Carolina On the night of November 18, I and a friend of mine were walking along the beach.  I looked out into the ocean and a little bit above the horizon I saw a light (the color of a streetlight) blink on then off, almost like the light faded off.  It was a circular light. My friend did not see this. As we kept walking in the same direction, I look up in the sky and notice the light again. I told my friend and he watched. There was a light (same one as before) come on and fade off, directly next to the right of it (with some space in between) I saw another light come on right after the first one and fade away, then another did the same (3rd one). For a little while they did not show up, until we started walking back to my car when we look up again and see another light come on higher up in the sky than the other times, as that one faded away diagonally to the left another light faded on and off. That was the last we saw the lights. About 10-15 mins later, we noticed that around the moon there was an outline of perfect circle of what looked like clouds. After a while it disappeared. I have seen shooting stars and planes before and this was definitely not one. The lights seemed to be stabilized and not moving when we noticed them, the lights stayed on for about 15-30 seconds before they faded away. Other than that I really do not know how to explain what we saw.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Unknown light.;2013-12-31 21:00:00;25-30 seconds;unknown light Live near airport.  Thought it was a helicopter at first but it was moving very slowly. Then thought it was a meteor but no tail was seen and it was to slow.  There was no sound.  It continued on same path and then when I was going to assume it was a helicopter the light just disappeared.  Very strange.

Seven white (sometimes orangish ) orbs spotted off coast of Wrightsville beach - One very active and rippling with colors.;2014-08-16 04:00:00;3 hours;Seven white (sometimes orangish ) orbs spotted off coast of Wrightsville beach - One very active and rippling with colors Date :  Saturday/August 16th/2014 Time span : From approximately 4 a.m. to approximately 7 a.m. Where :  Wrightsville Beach.   What we (my best friend and I) witnessed:   We walked out on the beach and stood by the water and immediately saw 3 bright orbs of light.. what I originally tried to explain to my friend as Mars, Jupiter or Venus.. one of them, further off in the distance to the right started moving to the right.   I watched to see if it was a plane or chopper (The ENTIRE 3 hours there were no sounds of any type of craft – only the sound of the beach break )and then noticed it’s unearthly/unrecognizable gliding/ propulsion/velocity.   We then noticed that it had a random wave of flashing lights amidst the bright white light.  It was scouting/scanning an area of what appeared to be about a 2 miles or so left to right – sometimes making erratic motions.. but mostly hovering at times and then accelerating rapidly – immediately from the point of motionless – to the left or right/ then smoothly and rapidly moving in horizontal directions. We stood – mouths agape – for about 20 minutes staring at this floating object .. and then it occurred to me to observe the other bright lights that were in the sky – because I know that ships have been spotted in clusters – and to my astonishment  - I saw the very same thing off to the right in the sky – closer and more above our heads – closer to the coastline.  I exclaimed “look!  There’s another one!! “and then looked off to the left where we had originally seen what I had thought to be Venus and Jupiter or Mars.  They were closer to each other than the other ones were.  They also, were both moving – side to side – left to right in their respective areas.  Each UFO was in their own area.  Each one was scouting/scanning/moving in their different width of the sky.  The third one we spotted and also the first one we noticed  moving  – had the largest scope of movement. It appeared to cover 2 or 3 miles left to right in the sky. Whilst the second we saw off to the right and closer to the shoreline was more like a mile or so to the left and right and sometimes moved in an oval shape.  Then the other two (the first two originally seen) I studied next.  They were also moving in what appeared to be their own individual parts of the sky (much closer together than the others)…with a back and forth / left to right/ sometimes oval movement.  I would like to note also that they all appeared at some time or another to move diagonally through the sky and then horizontally – immediately after moving diagonally!!  They all made movements of a nature that I have never before seen in my life. There were also extremely bizarre cloud formations to the left.  Not a cloud or star elsewhere in the sky.  Except for massive/ massive clouds that appeared strikingly as an angel / kneeling /head bent / holding an open book.  Very distinct crisp cloud formation – as if a large picture drawn.  The massive “wings “of the angel were a different type of cloud.    This cloud formation hovered for an hour in one spot over the sky.  People brought chairs out to sit and watch it.  Surfers stood and pointed at it. Seven of these orbs were spotted in all.   There was a bright light over our heads and it was moving in the same fashion as the other ones.  It was the only one that appeared to move – back and forth – in a very small space of the sky…whilst one off over the water moved back and forth in a large area.  That one rippled with colors – almost like the phosphorescence that underwater creatures have.  What appeared to be an odd form of twinkling we believe to be a fading and rippling effect.   These orbs all disappeared gradually at different times.  They would just disappear.  Their brightness and intensity did not seem to be hindered or fade away as the sun rose.  They just vanished one by one. The last one ever seen was the one we had noticed movement from originally (the third one spotted).  It seemed to be more active – color wise for some reason – than the others.  Maybe it was closer to us than the others.  The ones directly over the shoreline- over our heads - just appeared to be bright white light…whilst said orb over the ocean was bright white but with waving colors. All of these seemed to be about a mile and a half to two miles high in the sky.  Four of the orbs appeared to be in a diamond formation.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

Looked out to see a row of lights, changing in color, and blinking, in the sky.  It looked to be moving from side to side, then appeared to go up and down.   Suddenly it seemed to be going higher in the sky, when two separate lights approached it. Then, they too began to rise higher in the sky until out of sight.

Would make a diagonal line, and would be spread out. Saw orange-red circles/ovals that were appearing and then disappearing. One would appear and then another one, and then another one.  They would appear and then disappear. At first the lights were clumped together, then they almost made an S shape.   After about 5-10 minutes they appeared again but more spread out.  Three of them made a diagagonal line, and there were two on the opposite side.  I continued to wait for more lights, but they did not come back.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
One white light that dimmed and disappeared.;2020-01-18 19:30:00;3 minutes;One white light that dimmed and disappeared. Watched white circle come across the sky from west to east twice as fast as a jet.  As it passed over it slowly went dim and disappeared.  No sound.  Thought it might have been space station but way to low.  Did not burn up light shooting star.  Again slowly dimmed its light.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
3 Orange lights seen on College road in Wilmington, NC.;2021-06-20 05:12:00;2minutes;3 Orange lights seen on College road in Wilmington, NC. Dark early morning skies along College Road at 17th street intersection. I was returning to beach after taking a friend to the airport. Several cars were stopped on the road. I thought it was a traffic accident. I stopped behind another car and the driver got out of his car. As soon as he did, 3 orange lights zoomed by us overhead right above the tree line at a very fast rate of speed and continued down college road. I watched for a few minutes and then they were gone.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
