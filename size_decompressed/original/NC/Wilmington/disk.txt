multiple saucers, there and gone.;1992-09-03 19:00:00;5 - 9 mins;multiple saucers, there and gone. I've reported this more then once....not to you guys though. I hope to get some feedback this time. I was in a countryish type setting when I noticed an odd looking set of stars. I retrieved binoculars, focused in and saw 3 saucer shaped objects... they all had lights green, yellow, red if I recall correctly. They where sitting there motionless, Anyway, about 35 seconds later another identical saucer buzzed in out of nowhere....sat there about 10 - 15 seconds, then took off at the speed of light , maybe faster. About 2 seconds later the other 3 followed suit in the same direction. I never saw them again. I did have a large bottle cap looking ring on my right forearm for weeks following....can you tell me anything about this????;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

With my son and saw in the crisp blue clear skies a formation of disc shaped craft.;2018-10-18 12:00:00;30 seconds;At noon out for lunch with my son at the Mayfaire town center Chick Filet.  Stepped out of vehicle with my son and saw in the crisp blue clear skies a formation of disc shaped craft.   The color of the crafts were silver white.  There were over twenty four craft coming in from the Northeast and heading southwest. The crafts were going into and out of many V and unique formations.  The discs were almost in a dance like interaction with each other.  Tremendous speed within the tight formation was amazing.  I pulled out my phone to snap dozens of pictures as they sped to the southwest horizon.  I would estimate they were around 20,000 feet in the air.  I say that because airline paths that fly up and down the coast cruise around 30,000 feet and they appeared lower than that.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
