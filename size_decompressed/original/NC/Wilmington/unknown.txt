Dark figure buzzed our boat and it wasn't an airplane!;1998-05-16 02:20:00;2-3min;Dark figure buzzed our boat and it wasn't an airplane! Off the coast of Wilmington(South)about 7-8 miles out from Frying Pan Shoals, we were night fishing for some Grouper and off in the horizon I thought I saw a glimmer of something out of the corner of my eye, but didn't pay to much attention to it being that I was re-baiting one of our lines. My buddy was lying down below trying to catch a quick nap, so I kept an eye on things (making sure we didn't get runover by some freighter or something). After, roughly 5 minutes went by I saw a glimmer of something again, this time I kept looking in that direction but couldn't make out anything, but I began to hear what sounded like a faint hum. NO lights, just an object or something off in the distance. I started getting paranoid at this point and decided to turn on our nav lights just in case another boat was coming, but really couldn't hear anything outside of a faint hum. I woke my buddy up, and told him what was going on, then told him to help me look for something off in the distance, because I knew something was there. My biggest fear was that another vessel was coming straight at us and we just couldn't see the lights yet. Finally, to the SouthEast of us we both saw what we thought at the time was a freighter coming because of the size, but we both remarked about that in the probably 10-12 years we've been fishing together,we have never saw a large ship at night with NO nav lights on.  I started to grab my VHF radio to call and see if anybody knew what the hell was out there when all of the sudden there was this loud screaming sort of sound, not like a jet engine, but like a low pitch whine of a... I really can't think of anything, maybe a firework rocket inside of an empty dome stadium, sort of. It came right at us and over us by only maybe 30 feet or so, but it happened so damn fast that it almost gave us a heart attack. We stood there, both of us dumbfounded, we could almost hear each others heart beating we were so scared. After, about 5 seconds or so we both looked at each other and yelled What in the F--- was that. When we finally turned around in the direction of whatever it was went all we could see was that faint glimmer again, but suddenly the faint scream and the glimmer were gone. We radioed out to see if any other boats might have been close enough in the vicinity to see or hear anything, but naturally NO!  Shape and exact size are hard to tell, when it came at us I could barely tell, but it was tapered looking and it did have a metallic type look but not shiny. If you can picture a small airliner buzzing you at about 30 feet thats sort of how it was. Not a terrible amount of wind to speak of as it came by, about like a car coming by you on the side of the road, enough to feel it, but not like it's going to knock you down or anything. Why didn't we report it sooner, I don't know. We both tried to come up with everything imaginable to explain it, and yes, we did consider telling somebody about it, well, we did tell a few people, but nobody of an authoratative type nature, but when my wife came home one night after a PTO meeting and she told me that somebody remarked ---- been seeing anymore UFO's lately? Well, I kinda let it go. I really don't say to much about it anymore except to my buddy, when he suggested that I go look up some stuff on the net and low and behold I found this sight. So I figured what the hell? Well, thats about all I got to say on the subject, but if anyone else saw the same thing that night/morning, post it on here so I can see it. Thanks!;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Unkown encounter (Extremely Scary);2001-08-15 02:30:00;15 min.;Unkown encounter (Extremely Scary) I was sleeping in my upstairs room and I was awoken by a startling sight. A bright beam of light was coming in through my window and I happened to glance at the clock and the time showed 2:37am. Soon after, 3 sillhouttes were standing in my room around my bed. I was unable to move at all due to an outside force acting on me. For approx. 10 minutes the sillhouttes continued to stay pretty still with only slight movement, although they seemed to be communicating somehow. As fast as they appeared, they disappeared and I sat up in my bed. Once again I glanced at the clock and it read 2:37am. The next 5 hours of my life were total agony. I sat downstairs in my living room on the couch. My mother came out and had to calm me down. She commented about how flushed I looked and about how I looked more frightened than anyone she had ever seen. This event has haunted me ever since and I was recently introduced to this website, so I felt I should express it to everyone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Saw a small, bright object move across the sky, come to a complete stop, and begin flying in circles. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS??  PD));2005-11-18 18:35:00;15 minutes;Saw a small, bright object move across the sky, come to a complete stop, and begin flying in circles. The object was about the size of a plane in the night sky.  It was bright white, with no blinking lights at all.  I assumed it was a satellite or possibly the International Space Station, as any airplane flying that low would surely have visible blinking lights.   Two friends and I (all of whom are, in fact, college students) saw the light move east across the sky in a straight path.  It was somewhat faster than an airplane, but still slow enough for us to stand and watch it move for a good minute or so.   Then the object came to a complete stop in the sky, just above Mars.  We continued watching it further, and the object grew considerably fainter.  Then, it began to slowly fly in irregular circles for about ten minutes or so before finally fading away.   All three of us saw it move across the sky, stop, and begin circling, and all of us agreed on the direction it was moving.

Shortly after 5 very bright round yellow lights came on in a straight row from right to left sequentially. There was no sound. Then 3 lights came on right to left just beside this. This occured just to the right of Rich's inletover the ocean almost to Figure Eight island. We could not see a craft of any sort. I grabbed my binoculars and the lights filled the whole frame I could see so I assume this was very large. After about 15 seconds, it just disappeared from the sky. No trail,no sound. Three of us saw this plain as day.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

Two unexplained flying amber lights move apart and regroup over downtown Wilmington, NC.;2016-03-06 22:15:00;90 seconds;Two unexplained flying amber lights move apart and regroup over downtown Wilmington, NC. At approximately 22:15 on Sunday, March 6, 2016, three witness observed a low, slow moving unidentifiable object crossing the Cape Fear River over downtown Wilmington, NC. What was observed was two spherical amber lights moving along the river.  The object than made a curved turn.  The lights were then observed to move an equal distance apart briefly before returning to their original position. Absent from this event was any form of noise that would explain if this was a possible aircraft.  The lights moved apart and back in formation several times before completely disappearing from view. This event, upon investigation, closely matches a similar event that occurred in December of 2012 in another part of North Carolina. Their are no concrete details to report as to size and shape as all that could be seen were the very distinct lights.  An estimated guess would place them approximately 250 feet in the air moving at a speed of less than 80mph.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
10 white lights in formation, observed over Wilmington NC.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-28 22:10:00;5 minutes;10 white lights in formation, observed over Wilmington NC. My dad and his friend told me to come outside, and I observed 10 lights flying equally spaced, in a straight line moving North to South, all the lights disappeared at the same point in the sky.  There were no Navigation or strobe lights typical of aircraft. The lights moved without sound at an un determined altitude.  Iâ€™m guessing the lights were around the same altitude of normal aircraft or higher.  Approximately 45 minutes later a jet aircraft flew over South to North with normal aircraft lights and noise.  After the lights had passed we heard rumbling noises similar to thunder, but the weather was clear and local weather radar showed now precipitation.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
