((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))  Exploding Star;2005-04-29 21:00:00;5 minutes;Exploding Star My friends and I were out on a golfcourse about to play manhunt (a game which involves two teams and hiding in the dark). We were scoping out some area to hide in until I looked up and saw what looked like a moving star with symmetrical blue smoke on both sides. The smoke was on moving behind the star in a curved shape. I was like, That can't be an airplane! Everyone thought it was the craziest thing they had ever seen! Then all of the sudden, the star blew up into two pieces and it looked like a nuclear explosion in the sky. I was thinking Oh my god, a meteor is going to hit the earth. But the thing was, it didn't seem as if it was going to hit us at all. The star blew up into two smaller stars and kept on going in a straight line, one star behind the other. They did'nt dissapear at all and kept on going in one straight path. It was the freakiest thing that I have ever seen in my life. I don't know what the hell it was, but it's nothing that could have been made by man. It also couldn't be a meteor because when a meteor hits, it disintegrates. This one just kept on going. I'm wondering if anyone else saw this. It seemed like my friends and I were the only people that saw it. Please post something if you have seen something similar. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Fireball O'er Wilmington, NC. Unexplicable illuminations;2007-08-04 03:30:00;5 seconds;Fireball O'er Wilmington, NC. Unexplicable illuminations I had just put out my cigarette in an ashtray outside of residency when this enormous ball of light shot right from above my to past the trees outside my house. Whilst, this unexplicable illumination dawned on my yard and the surrounding areas.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Cluster of approxmitely 5 to 6 orange fireballs flying to the east and heading northeast over the ocean appearing to parallel the coast;2014-07-04 21:30:00;20-30 seconds;Cluster of approxmitely 5 to 6 orange fireballs flying to the east and heading northeast over the ocean appearing to parallel the coast I observed a cluster of approxmitely 5 to 6 orange fireballs flying to the east and heading northeast appearing to parallel the coast.  They were far enough away that they would have been over the ocean from this direction.  This occurred at approxmitely 9:30 PM.  This was the 4th of July and there were fireworks in the area however, these were extrodinarly high.  It would have been higher than most airliners fly.  I live very close to the northeast corridor that the airlines and military use frequently.  I am very familar with sky watching and frequently use a telescope.  These fireballs moved much faster than any known man-made aircraft, but slower than a metoer.  They disappeared after about 20 to 30 seconds and were totally different from anything I have ever observed.  These were not fireworks or meteors.  These were the fireballs that everyone seems to be seeing along the east coast.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

Objects that looked like fireballs in the sky. COMPLETELY SILENT!!!!!!!;2016-11-08 22:57:00;15 minutes;Objects that looked like fireballs in the sky.  COMPLETELY SILENT!!!!!!! My boyfriend and I were sitting on our back porch smoking a cigarette.  We live fairly close to the airport in our town and as we were talking we looked and saw what looked to be like two fireballs going through the sky.  After they got over and us the “flame” flickered out on one of the fireballs.  Then the second one dimmed and went out as well.  We caught all this on recording.  The weirdest thing was about ten minutes later we saw one in the sky again. It came from the direction of the airport and did the same thing as the last two.  It came over us and then the light went out again.  It continued to happen one more time before finally stopping.  The craziest part about all of it is these “crafts” never made a sound.  In one of the videos we were able to actually see a plane landing in the back ground and you can hear the plane but after it disappeared there was once again no sound.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
