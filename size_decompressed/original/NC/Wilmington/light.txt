Friday, Aug 16 10pm 10pm walked outside and noticed four lights in a large square through cloud cover. Very bright...north of my location.  The moon was visible South of me.  I took a number of pics with a Digital camera and would be happy to provide them.  My wife was also present at the time. I could not tell if the lights were separate or attached to a larger object.  They form a square...with the farthest lights appearing closer together.  Thanks, ((name deleted));34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

No soun;2003-06-14 21:00:00;1 minute;Two bright lights came into view as we were sitting on our back porch. They appeared to be fairly far away - like bright stars. No sound.  They hovered side by side for a few seconds. Then one of them quickly moved horizontally - and then shot straight up into the sky and disappeared (an L-shaped path).  The other followed the first one's path exactly and also disappeared.  We are near a Naval base.  Can planes do this? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Flying Silk ...;2006-06-15 21:00:00;5 minutes;Flying Silk ... This is the third time I've seen this Craft in the last 5 years.  Last night as I was standing outside talking on my cell phone in the driveway.  I looked up and noticed a bright single light moving across the sky at appox: 4-6,000 feet.  I have nicknamed this light flying silk because it moves across the sky at a seemingly effortless pace that I would estimate to be about 400MPH.  It emits no noise that I have ever heard, it has no strobes, nor aircraft navigation lights of any kind that I have ever observed.  Last nights observation had the object/light moving from Southwest to Northeast almost parrallel to the coast line.  I mentioned it to the person I was talking too on the phone an said something to the effect of well there it is again to them.   I consider myself to be a seasoned aircraft watcher and this object is like nothing I have ever seen flying in our area ... again, no strobes, no navigation lights of any kind.  This is the 2nd time flying silk has gone almost directly over my house in the last 4 years on nearly the same course.  A 3rd observation of flying silk occoured approx. 3 years ago as I was on a walk through the neighborhod.  The object moved at a steady pace of approx.  4-500 MPH at approx. 4000 feet ... East to West ... crossed the beach, went out over the Atlantic and went directly into a huge thunderstorm parked off the coast over the water.  Like it was on invisible rails in the sky.  Again, one easily observable single light, no strobes, no navigation lights, no sounds of any kind, no deviation from its flight path of any kind ... it went into the storm like it didn't know the storm was there ... or maybe it did.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Multiple orange lights over ocean in eastern sky of North Carolina;2007-09-25 21:05:00;60 seconds;Multiple orange lights over ocean in eastern sky of North Carolina I was standing on my porch looking out over the ocean in the eastern sky around 9:00 PM. The moon was very bright and beautiful and so I could see no stars in the sky.  One bright orange light appeared miles out over the water and at about 30 degrees from my vantage point.  It disappeared and them reappeared.  Next, another light just like it hovered out from behind the first one so that there were two side by side. Then they both disappeared.  After that, I saw one reappear where the original had been, followed by another and another all the way up to seven or eight of them side by side in a straight line.  Then they all disappeared together.   A little to the right of this event, the same thing happened again this time from left to right.  These certainly were not stars way too high and not consistent with any type of firework motion was not consistent with a comet or any other type of heavenly body.  I continued to look for another 20 or 30 minutes and saw nothing else.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Two lights seen with a lighting of something strobe like near the ground.;2009-10-10 20:45:00;10minutes;Two lights seen with a lighting of something strobe like near the ground. Tonight, I decided to go out around the same time as the night before when I spotted something in the sky, to see if there would be something out there.  There is a golf course and pond in my back yard and I looked up above this one tree and spotted a bright whitish blue light.  I watched it and noticed that it was somewhat still, but then it seemed to glide in the sky as it moved slowly to my right.  It went behind the tree, out of my vision, then back into my vision on the right side of the tree.  Then out of nowhere there was another light that came from the left.  It had the same light colors and same movement pattern, but it moved somewhat faster.  Then I am on the phone telling someone about it, and as the second light moves this dark yellow light is ignited like fire, and becomes a strobe-like light near the ground on the golf course.  It burns or stays lit for about 1 minute and then it moves to the right, consecutively quits burning or strobing and blinks two or three times and disappears.....There is nowhere for that light to go except off the golf course and onto the street, but I cannot see that far due to buildings.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
5-6 lights scattered on the horizon, helicopter in the vicinity;2010-08-10 22:30:00;2 mins;5-6 lights scattered on the horizon, helicopter in the vicinity All 4 of us saw 5 or 6 incandescent lights on the horizon scattered in a squiggly line up from the horizon. They slowly moved down and one by one disappeared. There was also a helicopter circling the area. Not sure if it was a flare or fireworks but was very odd.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Two stationary orange lights in the sky flickering on and off, fading to a reddish color before dissapearing.;2012-11-07 20:35:00;10 minutes;Two stationary orange lights in the sky flickering on and off, fading to a reddish color before dissapearing. Two orange lights/orbs appeared in the sky in Wilmington, North Carolina.  These lights were visible for 10-20 seconds before fading away.   After a few minutes, a single orange light/orb appeared at the same spot, was visible for roughly the same time period before fading away.   After a few more minutes, the light appeared for a third time, visible for several seconds before fading to a reddish/orange color and finally flickering out.  Throughout the duration of the sightings, the lights did not appear to move or change position, and no sounds were heard;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Orange light in sky Wilmington NC.;2012-12-05 18:05:00;15 seconds;Orange light in sky Wilmington NC My wife and I were driving S on River Rd. just about half mile south of Sanders Rd.   We noticed a orangish light in the distance over the Cape Fear river (one object only as we looked south).   As we proceeded we lost sight of the object do to trees.  Once we reached a clearing again with object was gone. I reported to MUFON similar objects in early 11/07/12 around 20:00 in what would be same area of sky or above Cape Fear river.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

Thought it was an airplane, until it remained in the same area and then went on to thinking it could be a drone.  However, drones usually don't last in flight longer than 35 minutes I thought?

Bright green neon laser light.;2016-08-08 00:00:00;10 seconds;Bright green neon laser light. I laid in bed and looked out my fourth story window and saw the brightest green neon light which almost resembled that of a laser come straight down out of the sky less than a mile from my hotel room.   It shot straight down out of the clear night sky and then dissipated into what looked like an orange fireball.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS MOVING SLOWLY;2019-02-28 02:45:00;90 seconds;TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS MOVING SLOWLY AT 2:45AM ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28TH, I WOKE UP AND WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT OUT MY SLIDING GLASS DOOR.  I SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN AIRPLANE COMING STRAIGHT TOWARD MY WINDOW, COMING OUT OF THE SSW.  MY ROOM IS ON THE 3RD LEVEL OF THE HOUSE AND THE HOUSE SETS MAYBE 10 FT ABOVE SEA LEVEL.  THE OBJECT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PROP JET BASED ON THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO LIGHTS.   I RAN TO THE DOOR AND WHEN I GOT TO THE DOOR THE LIGHTS THAT WERE, UP UNTIL THAT POINT, PARALLEL TO THE GROUND SWITCHED TO BEING PERPENDICULAR TO THE GROUND, BUT THE SAME DISTANCE WAS BETWEEN THEM.  AT FIRST GLANCE IT LOOKED LIKE THE PLANE HAD BANKED AND STARTED FLYING TO MY LEFT OR SSE.  I THEN OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED OUTSIDE.  ONCE OUTSIDE, I REALIZED I HEARD NO NOISE.  I COULD NOT MAKE OUT ANY CRAFT BETWEEN THE LIGHTS.   I STOOD THERE APPROXIMATELY 60 SEC WATCHING AS THE LIGHTS MOVED VERY SLOWLY IN THE SSE DIRECTION.  MAYBE MOVING APPROX 75-100YDS IN THE 60 OR SO SECONDS I STOOD THERE AND THEY WERE STILL IN PLAIN SIGHT WHEN I WENT BACK INSIDE.   I DID NOT WAIT TIL THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT.  THE LIGHTS WERE NOT BLUE WHITE LIKE THE STARS BUT MORE OF A CANDLELIGHT COLOR EACH LIGHT WAS IN SIZE APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF 1/10TH OF A FULL MOON.  EACH WAS MUCH MUCH BIGGER THAN ANY STARS OR PLANETS I CAN SEE.  IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT AT ALL TO KEEP IN SIGHT.  IT HOVERED ROUGHLY 30FT OFF THE GROUND. MY NAME IS ((female name deleted)) I AM 57 YEARS OLD AND I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Sighted one bright low-flying light slowly glide up and abruptly stop. originally guessed it might have been a helicopter or osprey out;2020-03-09 01:30:00;20;Sighted one bright low-flying light slowly glide up and abruptly stop. originally guessed it might have been a helicopter or osprey out of lejeune or new river but there was no noise and the flight pattern was too tight and in my opinion, impossible for conventional aircraft. Not long after it stopped and began to hover, a second smaller light appeared to almost morph out of the bottom of the craft almost like a bead of liquid dripping off.  The second object rotated around the larger original object several times while the original object pulsates with light, then (almost as if it were called back) the second object quickly emerged back with the original and the object took off in the opposite direction on a linear horizontal flight path.  Again there was never any noise and these objects were in my opinion within a half a mile of where I was as it was visible to me in my perspective. I am former military and am fully aware of what military aircraft would look like flying against a night sky and this was just not any man made aircraft in my opinion.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
