Looks like a Star Wars ship,without the top, smooth, silent, no lights, large and low to the ground..;1974-06-01 02:00:00;3 minutes;Looks like a Star Wars ship,without the top, smooth, silent, no lights, large and low to the ground.. Old UFO report. This sighting occurred in the early 1970's on River Road in Wilmington, NC around 2 am in the morning.  I am reporting it now because I am older and have heard of similar objects being seen on UFO tv reports.  So what the heck, I'll tell what I saw and maybe it will do some good. I was in my convertible traveling north along River Road about 2 am.  It was a clear night and the stars where out, no fog or clouds.  Then a very large craft came over the trees, I was very scared and thought 'what if I'm abducted'.  I pulled my car over so as not to draw attention to myself.  It was massive, about the width and length of a football field.  The shape reminded me of one of those Star Wars big star ships like the one at the beginning of the 1st episode but it didn't have a large top area, it was smooth and triangular, at the end it had 3 very large round engines just like the Star Wars ship.   The color was identical to the sky, when it went over me it blacked out the stars but looked like a hole in the sky because of the color match.   It was moving slowly, I'd say not much more than 35 mph and just above the trees, about 120 feet (tree hight 80' plus another 40').  It was dead silent, no noise at all and no lights, no windows that I could see,  As it pa! ssed, heading south, that's when I saw its features.   I watched until out of sight then got out of there.  I've kept it to myself until recently and then joked I saw a UFO then woke up.  But, what the heck, if will do some good or maybe someone else will recognize the description. I wonder what they have been doing all these years.  Obviously not attacking.  As I see it, if you have the means to travel like they must, you have access to all the resources you would ever want so mental growth would be more of a priority than desires to acquire things.  Hope this helps. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
My wife and I were stargazing on a beautiful clear night when we spotted a red triangle flying;1996-07-04 22:00:00;1 minute;This event took place on Wrightsville Beach which is a barrier island near Wilmington, NC. My wife and I were stargazing on a beautiful clear night when we spotted a red triangle flying almost straight above us, running silently and parallel to the shoreline. It was softly and evenly glowing red all over and it was about the shape of a classic paper airplane, longer than it was wide. It would have been about as long as your pinky nail is wide held at arms length. It might have been at 15 thousand feet above us-only a rough guess and it seemed to be going about 300 miles per hour. We watched it fly smoothly out of sight in maybe 40 seconds. I was shocked and fascinated to see something so strange but my wife thought it was just some kind of military plane. At that time I believed there could not be such things as ET craft, decided she must be right about it being a plane and mostly forgot about it. I always felt that was quite an under reaction on her part. I trust my own judgment now and I just wanted to share my sighting with other people in the hope they will come forward to tell their stories.

Rolling triangle seen moving in front of storm system.;1999-08-19 15:45:00;8-10 seconds;Rolling triangle seen moving in front of storm system. A severe thunderstorm warning was issued this afternoon for South Eastern N.C.  I watched as dark clouds approached from the northwest. While looking at the sky through my sliding glass door, something odd moving in the sky, caught my attention.  I quickly opened the door and ran outside to get a better look.  Moving directly ahead of the storm front and below the clouds was an object that I could not identify.  At first, I thought it was some type of missile.  It didn't have any wings. The object was silvery white and then it changed to black.  I realized it was actually in a continuous roll, end over end, as it crossed the sky.  On one roll it was very narrow and oblong.  On the next roll, there was the unmistakable shape of a triangle.  The triangle was black and equalateral with the corners slightly rounded.  The object continued to roll very quickly across the sky, and then it was gone from sight. This all happened in a matter of between eight to ten seconds.  The time was approximately 3:45pm.  The directional movement of the object was northwest to southeast.  There was no sound made by the object that I could detect.  There was only the sound of thunder in the distance.  The size of the object was about that of a nickel held at arms length.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Triangular object with lights rotated as it flew over me.;2007-07-16 22:40:00;Under ten sec.;Triangular object with lights rotated as it flew over me. I was getting out my friends car and I happened to look up at the night sky, and saw some lights. I thought it was a plane at first, but as I paid attention, I realized it was a perfect equilateral triangle dark grey, with one green light at one tip, and white lights at the others. It spun around as it kept flying. It was about as high up as one and a half cell phone towers, and about five times as large as a small plane.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Triangular Orange Glowing Lights Seen Over Wilmington, NC;2008-12-05 02:00:00;5 seconds;Triangular Orange Glowing Lights Seen Over Wilmington, NC A friend and I were at a rooftop bar on Friday December 5th (Saturday morning the 6th, if you want to be technical) around 2am in downtown Wilmington, NC.  We left the inside of the bar to go outside and get some fresh air.  It was freezing out, and we were the only two people on the deck outside at the time.  I looked up at the sky to try and find O'Ryan's Belt like I always do and noticed three glowing orange/red lights in the shape of a triangle.  It was above a thin layer of whispy clouds.  It was dark so I could not see  the actual shape of the object, but the lights led me to believe it was triangular.  Before I could say anything, the object moved very quickly across to the right and then curved straight up into the sky before it disappeared.  My friend and I looked at each other - he had seen it too - and both said at the same time: DID YOU SEE THAT?!?   We went inside to tell our friends but they were skeptical. I'm not one who has ever really believed in UFOs but after that night my opinions have changed.  I am positive that I saw something, and am reinforced by the fact that my friend saw it as well.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

Triangular gold foil rolling across the sky;2011-04-19 22:30:00;30 seconds;Triangular gold foil rolling across the sky My wife and 2 children and I were traveling from Charlotte NC to Topsail Island NC this past Tuesday evening.  We got to where the Battleship is just outside of Wilmington at around 10 pm.  I was driving and  my wife was in the passenger seat and both of my kids were in the backseat.  My son was on the passenger side in the back seat.   Within a couple of minutes after passing  the battleship I noticed a strange light over the  water  approximately 1000 feet up and it is hard to guess because it was dark and what I saw was either gigantic and closer than 1000 feet or very large and 500 feet away.   At first I thought it was some sort of fireworks but quickly knew that they weren’t.  The only way to describe what I saw is huge triangular pieces of shining gold aluminum foil or some sort of fabric but it was illuminated from within itself because there were no lights around that could have been shining on them.   First it appeared for about 3 seconds and then di! sappeared for 2 seconds and then reappeared next to the spot where it had previously been.   When I saw this happening I immediately said Look a UFO,  my wife was sleeping but my son who is 13 years old saw it as well.   After it appeared and disappeared 4 times which looked like it was rolling through the air it disappeared for about 10 seconds and then reappeared a few hundred feet away from where we saw it first.  It stayed illuminated for longer this time, maybe 5 seconds and was just hovering but this time when it went away it didn’t come back.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

Three white-yellowish lights and one red light in flying in a stretched out triangular formation, No Solid craft seen--transparent.;2012-09-01 01:30:00;20 minutes;Three white-yellowish lights, and one red light, in flying in a stretched out triangular formation, No Solid craft seen - transparent. Northern Wilmington, in the Porters Neck/Figure 8 area. Three white-yellowish lights and one red light in flying in a stretched out triangular formation.  Thought it was an airplane at first but the lights were moving very, very slow, almost hovering and were traveling in the direction of where my dad and I were, towards the house. Guessing when we first spotted them they were about a mile out, and it took a long time to approach where we were.  We were outside sitting on a deck (uncovered) and the lights were not near the ground at all, but not quite airplane altitude - close enough to know they were not floating lanterns.  When they got very close they flew (high) overhead but it was quiet, and was not an aircraft. Looking up you could still see the stars in-between the pattern of the lights - no shadow like you would see with a low-flying plane at night.  It was very eerie - did not know what to make of it.  I have never seen anything so bizarre and fascinating in my life. Had I not seen that there was transparency between the lights and stars, I would have just thought it was military related since that area isn't too far away from the base.

3 orange orbs in triangular form perfectly still.;2014-01-01 00:10:00;30 seconds;3 orange orbs in triangular form perfectly still It was right after twelve o clock and the ball had dropped to begin 2014.  We went outside to shoot off illegal fireworks.  My mom and I were in the yard shooting fireworks and my dad, two grandmothers, grandfather, and uncle were up on the porch.   A few minutes in to shooting off bottle rockets we noticed 3 orange orbs in  a isosceles triangle.  They were south of us and we live in landfall putting it over the Eastwood road area.  We were all staring at it and they just hovered for roughly 30 secs.  While still visible I thought they may be those paper bags with candles that people set off, but they stayed perfectly still and all quickly faded away at the exact same time.  I've looked and seen nothing on local news so far.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
((HOAX??))  Huge traingle craft with 3 light and a bright red light in the middle that did not make any noise just floated.;2014-02-10 20:30:00;5 minutes;Huge traingle craft with 3 light and a bright red light in the middle  that did not make any noise just floated. looking east, clear night and the moon was bright. (so the moon lite up the sky.)  seen    3 lights and a bright red in the middle.  Took a stronger look, and seen a huge triangle shape  2 lights at the end and one in the front with a strong bright red light that did not blink or flashed...  the craft did not make any sound.    when the craft passed my house and  crost the moons light i can see the outline and dame was it huge...  it just floated across the sky..    doing north .  I continued watching it  until i could not see it , yet could still see the bright red light  ..   then two  white light object's  followed the same path , they did not make any sound as well..... So wired.   Then, i  saw a normal a  commercial plane and its noise it make along with the exhaust it make.   so therefore the huge craft i saw was either a huge new military ((word deleted)) machine or a UFO, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Series of V shaped lights going fast and high in sky;2018-10-22 05:15:00;10 seconds;Series of V shaped lights going fast and high in sky I saw a vee-shaped formation of lights with 5 on one side and 6 on the other going south.    The lights seemed to be objects illuminated by the sun that has not come up yet.  The objects must have been up as high as normal satellites that I see all the time in the morning.  It traveled from north to south in about 10 seconds and I do not know of anything that can travel that fast.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Triangular Craft with Circular Light in Center;2019-10-12 14:49:00;10 minutes;Triangular Craft with Circular Light in Center Object was seen east of Middle Sound, near Wrightsville Beach, most likely off the coast.  Object was completely stationary, showing no plumes or means of propulsion. Object slowly dropped altitude and back up as if it was hanging from a fishing line. Video taken provided a picture that when zoomed in showed it to be triangular, with a circular light deriving from its center.  Object was eventually cloaked by the atmosphere after about 10 minutes and was no longer visible. Minutes later the area had familiar sounds of military fighter jets.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
