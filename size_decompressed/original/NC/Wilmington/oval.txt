My wife and I (we are in our early 40's) were in our back yard around 7pm. The sun was close to setting but was still light out. We live 2 miles from ILM airport, and our house seems to be right below a regular eastern seaboard flight track. This means we see aircraft daily very high up in the sky going north and south. While looking up in the sky, I noticed an oval, orange tinted object very high in the sky. It was about the same hight as the planes we see, but it was not moving. Then is slowly drifted south, about as slow as the rotation of the earth. I initially thought it was a satillite, and the orange color was the relfection of the sun. After thinking about it...it would have had to have been a really big satillite for us to see it that far away. We checked the papers to see if anyone else had seen it, but haven't found anything out about it.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

I remember them being oval shaped.  I had to park the car and the location of the lights were behind my building, so I could no longer see them once I passed the corner of my apartment building.  I tried to hurry out of the car with my children to go look again, but by the time I went around the building there was nothing.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

A bright white, oval sighting that moved in a manner unlike any aircraft I have seen in the area that unexplainably disappeared.;2011-09-09 11:00:00;2 minutes;A bright white, oval sighting that moved in a manner unlike any aircraft I have seen in the area that unexplainably disappeared. I was on NC 17 / Interstate 140.  I have driven the route since the bypass opened several years ago and I know air traffic in this area well.  At first I thought it was a white bird.  Then I thought it was a small business jet headed to the airport, but soon realized it was not a jet.  I then noticed it looked oval (almost saucer-like, yet seemed a little fatter in the center and was very bright white).  The movement was clearly not like any aircraft that I have seen in the are.  I lost sight of it as I passed a stand of tall pine trees (maybe 5 seconds, and when I came back into a clearing, it was gone.  Yesterdaay was a beautiful, clear day with large clouds in the distance.  I was shocked and surprised at how much it reminded me of a video-taped sighting that I have seen on TV in the past that I think was taken in Mexico.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Two lit Crafts fly over , witnessed by husband and wife July 4th 2013.;2013-07-04 21:00:00;5 minutes;Two lit &quotCrafts&quot fly over , witnessed by husband and wife July 4th 2013 On the evening of July 4, 2013 my husband and I were sitting outside in chairs observing fireworks. It was close to 9:00 PM.  Suddenly my husband said look at that, and pointed to the left of where we were sitting.  That would been East.  We witnessed 2 identical crafts one in front of the other flying fairly low going West.  Both had  a thin band of reddish orange windows going around their circumference that appeared to be lit up.  They might have been lights but I could see divisions between each window or light whichever it was.  There was no sound whatsoever.  We followed them with our eyes until they were completely out of sight.  One flew through a cloud and I saw it when it came back out and and watched it until it faded in the distance. Since, I have been persistent in trying to figure out what I saw.  It wasn't a firey ball, as many have described.  I will never give up trying to understand and figure out what we saw.  It was awesome...but in my 67 years the most amazing sight I have ever seen.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Blue oval with other lights on it traveling through the sky;2018-03-29 23:30:00;1 minute;Blue oval with other lights on it travelling through the sky It was around midnight when I heard what sound like a continuous vibration and I looked out my window to see a light blue oval travelling through the sky.  It had multiple other lights on it and was travelling at a speed faster than a normal plane.  It was not significantly faster than a plane but it was very clearly not a plane it was much bigger. This is not my first experience with UFO'S;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
