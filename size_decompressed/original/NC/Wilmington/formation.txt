2 lights on the left and 4 lights on the right. all golden in color and same intensity heading at 330`.;1999-05-24 21:55:00;1min. 6sec.;2 lights on the left and 4 lights on the right. all golden in color and same intensity heading at 330`. I go outside and let the dog do it's thing and look up and see these lights going overhead, quietly. Then as I keep looking at them, I notice a color of golden lights. I have always seen strobs and green and red, but, never just one color no matter how high in the sky. Ok, the altitude probably was about 2000 or 3000 but that as they passed me they split as 2 lights to the left and 4 on the right and keeping the same altitude they seemed to just pass at the same speed into the distance. Because it was black in the sky I could not see craft or size of object. Just the lights. They probably were on the rear of the craft and wing trails. Seeing many aircraft coming to wilmington international airport this was a first for me. I also see a lot of aircraft possibly going up the coast to camp legune nc. In this day and time I don't know if this is some kind of US aircraft of ufo. I just haven't heard you or Art or anyone speak of any kind of craft with only Gold lights. Thank You and I will try and send you other info.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
