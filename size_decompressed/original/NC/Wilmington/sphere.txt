The objects didn't appear to be balloons and were definitely not aircraft. The objects seemed to move independent of each other but at times did move together. They appeared to hover (or hang) in the sky, which led the observers to believe that the objects weren't aircraft. Balloons were ruled out because no one in our area has a hot air balloon and we've never heard of 7 weather balloons being launched at the same time. The objects eventually moved due east, heading out over the ocean. One of the observers managed to videotape the sighting and when he asked his neighbors for their thoughts (they witnessed it as well), they had no idea as to its origin either. Although the observers watched the object by eye and with binoculars for close to 30 minutes, it was nearly impossible to detect any specific features on the objects. For what it's worth, we typically do not have a lot of helicopter activity in our area. But strangely enough, three days later, one twin-rotor (apparently military-green) and one black high-tech-looking Huey-shaped helicopter circled the same area most of the afternoon until dark.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

This object moved on multiple axises and in patterns not comparable to human technology.;2013-02-03 06:15:00;5 minutes;This object moved on multiple axises and in patterns not comparable to human technology. At approximately 6:15 eastern standard time I was exiting my neighborhood heading south.  The Object in question first appeared as a royal blue color, spherical in shape, very bright and vibrantly lit.  It was hovering at what seemed to be a reasonably high altitude as i could spot it through the trees of the following shopping center.   The object then began to change to a white, then a green, whilst disappearing entirely for a brief moment only to return in a shade of purple.  The object rose to a great distance and then after peaking it declined rapidly, came to a complete stop and then started moving left to right.   The object then ascended and disappeared from my view.   I used an HTC evo to capture the event and will be submitting video as well as compass screen shots following this submission.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632

Vehicle sized UFO at the same height as busy stoplight, unlike anything we had ever seen, defied laws of physics as I know it;2017-12-01 15:00:00;~1 minute;Vehicle sized UFO at the same height as busy stoplight, unlike anything we had ever seen, defied laws of physics as I know it In late November / early December of 2017, I was living at a student living apartment complex at the intersection of Randall Parkway and S College Rd, Wilmington, NC 28403. I am 23 years old now, and was about 20 years old at the time. My one other witness to this event is my roommate (K) at the time, who was about 25.  I remember this day pretty vividly as it sent me into a bit of an obsession for months after this happened. I first assumed that what we saw was military since we are coastal. I will relay what happened as best as I can. I had never considered until recently what we saw that evening could’ve been ET.  About 4:30 / 5 PM - K and I are going to a gas station up the street. We turn right from Pepys Ln, left onto S College, and go to the BP on the right side of the road. This is just barely off of UNCW campus. K goes into buy beer since I am underage, and we set back for the short .3 mi journey home.  We were sober when we left for the gas station, and had been all day. Neither of us have hallucinogenic or delusional mental disorders, and have never seen anything like this. I am driving, and turn left back onto S College, and K and I almost immediately see a rather large aircraft. It was hard to tell at first glance how close it was and the size, but it didn’t take long to realize that it was flying at about the same height as the stoplight we were approaching. It was so low.  I then noticed that it was dark grey/black, the size of a typical sedan, and was spherical with short wings extending from the sides. The shape was honestly hard to decipher because I had never seen any type of craft designed this way, and definitely not this close to the ground.  I remember hearing a low whirring. I think that it may have had two propeller sort of mechanisms underneath the wings. I couldn’t tell if it was big enough to be manned or unmanned. K and I were both yelling at each other to make sure we were seeing the same thing. Without having to say much at all, we were both in awe of what we were seeing, and also terrified.  I needed to get in the right turn lane at the light (S College/Randall) to get us back home. Along that turn lane, vehicles could turn earlier into a Rooms To Go parking lot that was across from where K and I lived. I wanted to try snd keep looking at what we were seeing, so I quickly turned into the RTG lot. It seemed like the craft noticed me, and it made a ~45 degree turn with minimal effort, and immediately went in the direction of Randall Pkwy over the RTG building.  I saw when it turned that it almost went belly up, and I couldn’t tell how it gained momentum so quickly. It moved away from my vehicle at what I would guess 45/50 MPH, after hovering right above S College Rd barely moving for a solid 20-40 seconds.  I was so in shock of what we had seen, as was K, that we agreed to immediately call the non emergency police number to try and make any real sense of it. We were still at this point convinced we had seen some kind of military UAV/drone/etc, but I have done extensive research and have not seen anything remotely similar to what we saw that day.  The police officer I spoke with asked me if I was being held against my will by somebody and if I had taken any drugs (lol). I knew it sounded ridiculous, but we are both clear on what we saw that day, and have not found any answers that point us in the direction of what it could have been.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
Very Fast Bright Sphere in the Sky.;2020-04-18 03:00:00;5 seconds;Very Fast Bright Sphere in the Sky I was walking my dog down a dark un-lit road around 3am on Saturday morning April 18th 2020.  While looking forward, I noticed light coming from over my shoulder, expecting it to be a car headlights I turned around and immediately noticed upwards in the sky and rather close to the ground (under the clouds) was a very large fast moving sphere/circle of light moving across the sky.  It was definitely a physical object.  It disappeared into the horizon behind the trees and into the clouds.;34.228050201208;-77.882986049632
