I witnessed a cigar shaped object with a  bright light center and an emerald green glow around it. The object traveled slow enough for my eyes to follow easily.  I am guessing the object was maybe 200 ft. away and was 30-40 ft. long.  I watched as it was coming straight down but just as it nearing the tree line the object ...I want to say exploded but thats not exactly what happened.  It expanded tremendously verticly only and was as bright as 10 bolts of lightning.  My husband saw the explosion part only.  But we are stunned.   As I ran to see where this object had landed in the trees I saw a jet/fast plane come up behing it almost immediatly.   There was no impact.  No noise. No smoke.  Nothing!;35.8516;-82.5212999999999
