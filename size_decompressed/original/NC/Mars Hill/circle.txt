It was so bright that it left me breathless for a second and then it was gone. It appeared to look about the size of a large beach ball in comparision to the size of the sky any idea what I saw and did anyone else see this last night?;35.8516;-82.5212999999999
Object was incredibly fast, never seen anything like it.;2014-10-23 09:45:00;20 seconds;Object was incredibly fast, never seen anything like it. Noticed while riding passenger in a vehicle a incredibly shiny round object in the sky.   I watched it for several seconds then notice that it moved incredibly fast to a different location in the sky then moved back for about two seconds, then after that it was gone.
