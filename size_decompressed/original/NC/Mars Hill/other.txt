Bright objects in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a moth, captured by the camera.  PD));2006-09-03 08:04:00;less than 1 min;Bright objects in sky We have had a critter cam set up and running for several months on our property.  During one 4 day span it captured 112 photographs.  Two of the 112 photographs were of something that we can not logically explain.  Other photographs were taken around the same time but did not have the object in them.  They were taken on 9/3/06 at 8:04 PM and on 9/6/06 at 7:58 PM.  There are no power lines in this area, camera is on a ridge line, closest mountain range is in plain view, I26 and all traffic signs are not visible from this area and are located in the hollow between the two mountain ranges.  The objects are extremely bright, are tilted in different directions on each photo, and seem to be showing directional light. ((NUFORC Note:  The object in question looks to us to be a moth, captured by the camera.  Not a UFO, we believe.  PD));35.8516;-82.5212999999999
