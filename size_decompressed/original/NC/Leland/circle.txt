Two white lights above Leland (NC) moving towards Carolina Beach;2011-11-07 16:30:00;20 secs;Two white lights above Leland (NC) moving towards Carolina Beach Two oblong, hazy-white, illuminated objects, one slightly higher than the other, tracking southeast across the night sky, less than a quarter mile from my home.  Appeared to be approximately 500 feet in the air, separated by about 50 to 75 feet, moving slowly for first 15 seconds, then speeding off faster behind the tree line. No sounds of jet or prop engine noise despite being so close to my location. I immediately turned on the police scanner to determine if there were any aircraft over the town or on approach to the local airport (Wilmington International). No aircraft traffic reported inbound, outbound or in the greater Wilmington (NC) area at the time.  Verified the radio traffic at the airport with a call to another amateur radio operator and also confirmed with the airport's arrival/departures website.;34.2644;-78.0590999999998
