3 objects in the sky looking toward Wilmington NC from Leland NC.;2012-10-01 18:02:00;Unknown;3 objects in the sky looking toward Wilmington NC from Leland NC. After seeing a rainbow, I stopped to take a picture of the double rainbow and did not notice the 3 objects in the bottom of the picture.  After showing the pictures to my son, he pointed out the 3 objects.  I went back to the same spot the next day and snapped another picture almost right where I was when I took the picture the prior day, and the objects were not there.;34.2644;-78.0590999999998
