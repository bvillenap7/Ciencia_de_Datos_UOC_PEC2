Three glowing lights moving slowly across the sky.;2011-10-17 20:00:00;5 minutes;Three glowing lights moving slowly across the sky. My husband and I were taking our dog out and my husband looked up and called me over to look at these lights.  I went to look and they were in a straight line moving perfectly together.  Three of them. No noise.  No flashing lights.  We stood there and watched for about 5 minutes and then they just vanished.  The objects were round and very bright white with a blue and orange tint around the edges.;34.2644;-78.0590999999998
Two Bright Dots, moved simultaneously and faded;2020-12-05 18:55:00;1 minute;Two Bright Dots, moved simultaneously and faded Sighting from backyard in Brunswick Forest development, Leland, NC (near Wilmington, NC)  Two bright dots in the sky between Mars and Neptune at 6:55pm approximately, December 5, 2020.  The dots were aligned perpendicular to the line between Mars and Neptune. They were about the size that Mars appeared, but brighter than Mars. When I first looked up and saw the two dots positioned as they were, it looked like Orion’s Belt. Then I said, “hey wait a minute”, since there were only two stars! As I said that, the two stars dimmed to about the brightness of Mars. They were about an inch apart if I was to hold my hand up to the sky to guess distance.  After they dimmed, they simultaneously moved about two “sky inches” from my position up and to the right. Then they rapidly faded from sight without moving location.  It was a clear evening, mid 50s temperature, moon had not yet risen above my sight line. I was looking almost due south at the time. The “dots” were about 45 degrees up from the horizon. No sound.  Observed by one adult female, aged 46. I’ve seen other craft over the years dating back into the 1990s.;34.2644;-78.0590999999998
