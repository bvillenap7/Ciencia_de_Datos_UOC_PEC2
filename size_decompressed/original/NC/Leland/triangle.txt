Two light in the sky that responded to camera flashes.;2013-09-08 00:50:00;0.5;Two light in the sky that responded to camera flashes. My brother and I noticed a light in the sky, the light was like a strobe type changing colors from white to red to blue.  Then we noticed a smaller light directly across the sky to it. It to was changing colors.  The two light were in sync with each other. I tried to video tape it with my phone, but the lights wouldn't show up.  So I began to flash my camera towards the large one.  When I did it began to change color and move up and down, right to left. I did the same to the small light. The big light would respond in the manner.  The small light would just change color.  At one point the large light became bright and looked triangular in shape.  The lights are still outside and are still sitting in the sky.  The large one would do maneuvers like I have never seen before. Almost as it were like a pen writing in the sky. That is the only way I know how to explain it.;34.2644;-78.0590999999998
Silent triangular shaped craft glides fast across the sky.;2014-11-30 20:00:00;45 seconds;Silent triangular shaped craft glides fast across the sky. Bright orange/yellow light came across the sky.  Underneath the craft I was able to make out that it was triangular in shape.  Red and orange lights.  The craft was silent and seemed to just glide across the sky and a fast speed.;34.2644;-78.0590999999998
