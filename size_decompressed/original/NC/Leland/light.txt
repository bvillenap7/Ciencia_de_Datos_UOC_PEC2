I have seen this craft several times and usually in same general area.   I saw it one time at 1 pm and it was zig zagging and cutting flips with circles at a very fast pace.   Watched this for at least 20 min while the lights kept changing colors.   There was a similar sighting on our local news channel that other people saw a similar light doing same thing around 2 weeks after my sighting;34.2644;-78.0590999999998
