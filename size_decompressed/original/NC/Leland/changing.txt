Silent ball of light traveling at extremely fast speed, witnessed by 3 people.;2013-12-06 00:27:00;5 seconds;Silent ball of light traveling at extremely fast speed, witnessed by 3 people. My husband I were out side at 12:27am eastern time.  When I seen a light hoovering out of the corner of my eye.   At first I thought it was a star.  It was bright yellow/orange.   It flew over us just above the tree line going at a speed I have never seen an aircraft go.  It was gone in a matter of seconds.   Once it passed the tree line in our yard we could see green and red lights,  making it appear possible a triangular shape.   During this time brother came out side and also witnessed the craft.   I don't know if the incidents are connected, but right before we went outside my husband had a sleep paralysis type thing happen.  I don't want to sound crazy, but it is a very large coincidence.  Of this craft hovering behind our house and him having the dream like episode.   Also, no noise was could be heard.;34.2644;-78.0590999999998
