Orange orb or oval seen in the distant sky in NC.;2015-10-22 21:05:00;15 minutes;Orange orb or oval seen in the distant sky in NC. I can't say exactly what we saw.  My son and I were outside around 9 pm, 10/22/15.  It was very dark, but we were just playing toss with the football, and he pointed up to the sky in the south and I saw an orange oval shining orb sitting stationary.  It wasn't moving so I passed it off as being Mars or Venus.   But a few minutes later as as threw him the ball one moment he saw the planet-looking thing and by the time him caught the ball seconds later the object in the sky had disappeared.  Admittedly, we can usually see Mars or Venus however you see those planets throughout the night and whatever we saw was gone.   I've always been a skeptic but this experience has definitely peaked my curiosity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
