In the Eastern sky ( Over Charlotte NC )  2 Fireball like objects orbited around each other super fast for 45 seconds to a minute before making a straight line completely out of sight to the South. Oddly enough a neighbor 3 houses down from me was outside and saw the whole thing unfold as well.  From my perspective the fireballs appeared to be the size of small car. 10-14 feet in diameter.;35.3083999999999;-81.0256
