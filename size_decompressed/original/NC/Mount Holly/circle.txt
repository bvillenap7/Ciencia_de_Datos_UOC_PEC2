It was very bright and it appeared lower and closer than the typical plane traffic we see from the airport.  It was also flying in a different direction (East) than planes we  normally see.  I was so fascinated that I almost forgot to take a photo, but was able to get a quick photo with my phone before it went out of sight, but unfortunately it was quite a distance away.  The interesting thing was there was no noise at all, totally quiet.  It appeared as a circle to us, but we zoomed in on the photo it appeared to be a rectangle with four sides  visible.  There was light cloud cover and it almost looked like a typical moon in a light cloudy sky.  There were no flashing lights and it appeared to be juste one single light.;35.3083999999999;-81.0256
