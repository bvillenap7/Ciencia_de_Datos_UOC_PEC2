It was raining.  Some were flashing, some were still and one zipped across my line of sight downward like a drone or craft descending toward my lawn.  One was right above my neighbor's house. Another, above my garage, then disappeared.  The activity continued to a lesser extent after about 10 minutes.  They were all small white lights.   There appeared to be a couple of aircraft in the sky at the same time.  I heard nothing unusual.;35.2621;-82.6666
