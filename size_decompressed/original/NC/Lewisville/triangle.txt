OBJECT WAS 3 LIGHTS IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE WITH BEAMS OF LIGHT ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2005-01-05 22:45:00;approx. 10 min;OBJECT WAS 3 LIGHTS IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE WITH BEAMS OF LIGHT CONNECTING THEM AND PULSING BEAMS GOING THROUGH THOSE STEADY BEAMS. I WAS IN BED ON THE NIGHT OF 5 JAN. THE NIGHT SKY WAS CLEAR AND THE STARS WERE SHINING. I COULD NOT SLEEP AND WAS LOOKING OUT MY BEDROOM WINDOW AT THE SKY. I NOTICED 3 ROUND LIGHTS IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE. IT LOOK LIKE THEY WERE SENDING A BEAM OF LIGHT TO ONE ANOTHER.  THEN A PULSING BEAM OF LIGHT WOULD GO THROUGH THE STEADY BEAMS OF LIGHT. I WATCHED THIS FOR APPROX. 10 MINUTES. THE OBJECT DID NOT MOVE EXCEPT FOR THE PULSING BEAM THE WHOLE TIME I SAW IT.  I TOLD MY FATHER AND HE SAID I WAS SEEING THINGS AND CLOSED MY SHADES. THE NEXT DAY,  I WENT TO THE SCHOOL LIBRARY TO LOOK FOR A BOOK ON UFO'S AND I SAW ON THE COVER OF THE BOOK I CHECKED OUT, THE VERY SAME OBJECT I SAW THE NIGHT BEFORE. THE BOOK DESCRIBED IT AS THE BELGUIM TRIANGLES. I JUST SAW THE ABC SPEICAL ON UFO'S AND I SAW YOUR STORY ON THE NEWS. I DIDN'T KNOW WHO TO REPORT IT TO TILL SAW YOUR AGENCY. IT IS SAYING ON THE NEWS THAT OTHER PEOPLE IN NORTH CAROLINA ARE SEEING THE SAME OBJECT I SAW. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));36.0996833333334;-80.4199833333334
