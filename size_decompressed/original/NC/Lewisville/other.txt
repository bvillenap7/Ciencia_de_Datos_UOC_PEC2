Round white lights creating a large hex shaped object outline in night sky of the Triad suburbs.;2016-09-14 02:30:00;~2:00 minutes;Round white lights creating a large hex shaped object outline in night sky of the Triad suburbs. Viewed a stationary and vertically positioned hexagonal shaped series of round white lights creating its shape. Judging the size I'd have to say larger due to estimated distance and elevation.  No sound was heard from my home bedroom, and after approximately (2.0) minutes it arced to its left and descended very slowly to disappear behind several stands of distant tree lines.  Did remind myself the extensive Jade Helm military operation was coming to an end, but this object was percieved as real and not a traditional aircraft.
