Circular red object moving quickly.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-08 19:00:00;<1 minute;Circular red object moving quickly I was driving home down a narrow country road with tall trees on each side and it was dark.  I thought this red dot was initially a helicopter but it appeared suddenly and zipped quickly over the trees from N to S then right back across from S to N – too quick of movement for a helicopter.   Then, immediately, a small red light appeared, not moving, centered above the road and just as quickly disappeared.  Maybe a drone/prank?  I can’t stop thinking about it.
