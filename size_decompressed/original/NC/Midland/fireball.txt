This report concerns two  -  [2] sightings – within the confines of my bedroom.  •	The first incident occurred in December 2008. 	   While asleep at approximately 0230 – 0300 I awoke to the sight of about 4-6 white balls (the size of a Ping-Pong ball, swirling in a clock-wise motion and exiting my bedroom, through the venetian blinds which were closed.  	As one can imagine, I was mystified at the sight of those luminous balls of light, vanishing through the closed blinds.  	There was no sound associated with the incident.  I perceived no “communication” of any kind.   •	A second similar incident occurred at about the same time of the morning in February 2012. 	 I was awakened by the sense that something was happening.  I cannot describe the feeling, other than ‘something’ was happening.  	I raised my head from the pillow to observe one [1] single, white illuminant white ball, the approximate size of a Ping-Pong ball, ‘dancing’ up and down the entire length of my dog, which was sleeping on the floor approximately six feet from me.  The light reminded me of the sing-along ‘bouncing ball’ at the bottom of the television screen when a song is being sung with subtitles provided for the lyrics.  	I was astonished at the sight!  The light started at the dog’s nose and ended at the tail.  The light then vanished, and presumably exited the room.  The lights in the bedroom were - off.  I then drifted off to sleep.  	Within what seemed to be a matter of minutes, I felt as though I was now being observed!  I opened my eyes without raising my head from the pillow to observe the same white luminous ball now directly in front of my face, at a distance of perhaps 2 feet!  	When I opened my eyes the ball began to ‘dance’ from my head to my toes – the full length of 	my body.  There was no communication, there was no sound, and the light/ball seemed ‘programmed’ to do so, without any concern at being observed by me.  	The ball of light in both cases remained constant, without any increase or decrease in brightness.  All motion was constant and consistent in both cases.  	I had never before personally seen or heard of such a thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.2501;-80.5298
Green fireball.;2015-07-02 21:10:00;2 seconds;Green Fireball Witnessed an unusually bright meteor that may have actually made it to the ground.  It was coming straight down 90 degrees from my location.  I saw from about a 50 degree inclination all the way down to the horizon.  It maintained a dark green glow all the way down.  It was still dusk the sky has been very smokey here for the last couple of days and a nearly full moon had just risen just a few degrees from where I saw it.  These factors that would made visibility difficult are the reason I felt this would be worth making a note of and at any other time of night this fireball would have been bright enough to cast shadows on the ground.;35.2501;-80.5298
