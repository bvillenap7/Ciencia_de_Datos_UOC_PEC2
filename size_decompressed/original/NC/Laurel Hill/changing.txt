Large, exploding fireball;2010-10-29 06:40:00;5 minutes;Large, exploding fireball I was driving to work at around 6:40, may have been a little later when I saw what appeared to be three shooting stars.  Then I realized they lasted a lot longer than a shooting star and had a tail, kind of like a firework that is ending.  Then they converged into one big fireball, that continued to fall with a tail.  I thought maybe I was witnessing some type of meteor or something.  After this large ball fell for a bout two minutes, it kind of exploded in 10-12 smaller objects that were lighted and were obviously controlled by something, they were no longer falling   They moved around, formed a large circle and finally disappeared.  This was the strangest thing I've ever seen.;34.8274;-79.5473
