Triangle shaped object seen in NC sky;2008-01-18 21:00:00;20 seconds;Triangle shaped object seen in NC sky I went to let our dog in, we were expecting snow later in the night. I looked up at the huge ring around the moon. In the glow of the moon I noticed something moving west to east. It was barely visible at first glance, but as it moved closer to the moon overhead I saw a very distinctive triangle shape.  I could not get a good judge of its altitude but the object appeared to be quite large, had no lights and made no sound.  It was not a cloud. As it moved away from the moon, it grew dimmer.  I ran back in the door to get my wife. By the time I stepped back out, it was no longer visible.;35.377;-81.3537999999999
Close Triangle changing into bright lights red/white;2014-05-04 21:29:00;5 minutes;Close Triangle changing into bright lights red/white. Me and a friend of mine were driving to a gas station named Triple B out in the country.  I noticed a flashing unusually bright red light in roughly a second and a half increments.   Well as we get closer to the store, I noticed this object was not moving.  At this point we drive a little further and damn near end up right under it.  It is literally hovering right behind the store.  That's when I noticed it was a triangle sitting still pulsating a bright red light and emitting no sound.  It then suddenly changed shape or cut off its red light.  Then looked like sparkling bright diamonds in patterns of three.  Then it just took off slow at first then all of a sudden it was fading into the horizon.  I also tried to take a picture of it on a phone with full battery, it suddenly had no charge.  Not my first ufo experience but definitely a strange one.;35.377;-81.3537999999999
