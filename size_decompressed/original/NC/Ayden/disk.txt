Fast moving object traveled under my drone.;2016-10-26 14:12:00;1 second;Fast moving object traveled under my drone. On Oct. 26, 2016 at about 14:12 in the small town of Ayden, North Carolina (Pitt county) while flying my DJI Phantom 3 Professional aerial camera, I captured an object flying from SE to NW. This object traveled a distance of about 1.2 miles in 1/3rd of a second. My position was at the Ayden District Park and my drone was headed back to my position traveling from NW to SE. At the time my drone captured this object on video, it was about 1/2 mile from me. The air speed of my drone was about 26 mph. The altitude of the drone was 187 feet. My drone was recording video in 4K resolution at 30 fps. I did not see, nor hear this object at the time I was flying my drone. Upon video review I noticed this object on video on my UHD TV. I replayed the video several times trying to figure out what I was seeing. I then ran the video through my editing software to shorten it to just the time frame the object appeared and slowed the frame rate by 10 times. The object flew beneath my drone. I sent MUFON a report that same day along with the URL address to my Youtube channel containing the video. I received a call from Sandy Davis, an investigator with MUFON within 30 minutes.  He was totally amazed by what my drones camera caught.  The MUFON experts were unable to determine what I caught on video, but were extremely intrigued and consider it to be a mystery. Here is the URL containing the video:    https://youtu.be/6BUA6zdbgEE ((NUFORC Note:  The video, taken from a flying platform, is very high quality, and certainly has captured something interesting.  However, we are unable to certify that the object qualifies as an authentic UFO.  The object that streaks by the camera appears to be quite small, perhaps the size of a bird.  PD));35.4562;-77.4095
