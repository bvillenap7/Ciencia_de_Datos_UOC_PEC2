Unexpected UFO Sighting;2008-02-13 23:30:00;3 seconds;Unexpected UFO Sighting I was talking to my girlfriend on the cell phone a couple of nights ago, actually venting about a bad night out with another friend of mine where we got into an argument about some ultimately silly issues.  I was roaming around outside with my three dogs, letting them go potty, when I turned around to see over the silohuette of the treeline a blue-white orb rise suddenly from the horizon, then dart off at an abrupt angle straight to the right and disappear, with no sound. It moved with the same speed and light residue of a shooting star, except that this night, it was drizzling rain, and the entire sky was overcast gray. You couldn't even see the moon, the cloud cover was so thick.  I've tried to rationalize what I saw several times, but seeing as how whatever it was flew below the clouds, I can't think it was a shooting star, and since there was no thunder or lightning, I can't see how it could be any atmospheric phenomena either.;35.4562;-77.4095
