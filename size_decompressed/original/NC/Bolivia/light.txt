Amber lights in sky.;2015-02-11 20:30:00;3 seconds;Amber lights in sky Approximately 8:30 ish pm, February 11, 2015, took the dogs out to pee, looked to the left, towards Holden Beach area, saw a longish amber light, very fuzzy, burning in the sky.  Then a squarish amber light appeared to the left of the long light, swiftly moved towards and over it, then both disappeared.  The square light was very defined, sharp, crisp edges.  When I saw the longish light, called to husband to come and help identify and in a matter of seconds, both were gone.  Like opening a door and closing it.  No sound or odor dogs didn't react in any way.  Too quick for husband to see.;34.025;-78.1727
