Fast flying object that zig zagged across the sky.;2005-06-04 23:00:00;2 minutes;Fast flying object that zig zagged across the sky. I went outside to unload items from my trunk when I caught a flashing white light to the left of the car at the top of the ridge,  I thought it was a plane so I watched it for a second then it darted to the middle of the sky in less than a second flashing extremely fast then vanished for about two seconds then reappeared three degrees to the right then started to zig zag left and right above my head at a high rate of speed  it moved like physics did not apply to this object.  It vanished above my apartment and did not reappear.;36.45;-81.6506
