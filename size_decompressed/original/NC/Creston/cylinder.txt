Silver, shiny cylinder-shaped object spotted with no noise, no wings, no lights in Creston, NC.;2019-08-19 19:02:00;1 minute;Silver, shiny cylinder shaped object spotted with no noise, no wings, no lights in Creston, NC. On August 19, 2019 at approximately 7:02 p.m. ET in Creston, NC, I saw a silver cylinder shaped object about the size of a bus moving through the sky from a northeast direction toward a southerly direction.  No noise, no lights, no wings.  It was moving quickly and although the skies were cloudy, there were intermittent breaks in the clouds where I spotted this “thing”.  I watched it until it disappeared into a cloud. Some months back, I saw an object which looked the same on two different occasions, but there were two of them at that time.  One went over followed by another one shortly thereafter which looked identical.  The first time the objects were going from a southerly direction toward the northeast.  The second time I saw them, which I believe was the next evening before dark,, there were also two of the objects going in the opposite direction.   One following the other with a good distance between them so as both were not visible together. Someone posted a picture from California on this site which I saw and it looked the same as the object I saw.;36.45;-81.6506
