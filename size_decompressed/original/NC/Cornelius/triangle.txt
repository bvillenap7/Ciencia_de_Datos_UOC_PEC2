amber triangles night time sighting with aircraft;2002-04-02 20:55:00;6 seconds;amber triangles night time sighting with aircraft I was laying in my hammock and stairing up at the sky. Suddenly I saw  2 triangles a light amber brown in color flying almost directly over head. they looked about the average size of an airplane but seemed to fly much lower. There was no sound and no lights on the objects. I quickly tried to discount what I was seeing but new it could be nothing I have seen before. The sighting lasted a few seconds and then three planes came from West, South and Southwes moving in the same direction as the triangle objects. They were about 5-10 seconds behind.;35.4740000000001;-80.8729000000001
