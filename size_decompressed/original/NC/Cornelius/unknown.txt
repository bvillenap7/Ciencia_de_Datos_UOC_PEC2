I went to the window and looked in the sky and it was lit up brightly in one area over Lake Norman.  I was able to take 2 pictures and 1 video.  When I videoed the sight, the lights pulsated every 2 seconds for a period of 35 minutes in the same spot.  Very unusual sighting.  I was told by a local newspaper reporter that a pilot has also reported the same type of sighting 2 hours earlier about 25 miles away from my location.;35.4740000000001;-80.8729000000001
