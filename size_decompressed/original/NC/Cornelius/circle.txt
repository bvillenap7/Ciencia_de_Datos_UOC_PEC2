Between 8:15pm EST and 8:20pm EST on Wed., Sept. 17, 2014, I was driving in my apartment complex and noticed two planet-size, circular, reddish-orange lights in the southern sky about 45 degrees up.  As I tried to get to a clear spot and park, one of the lights (the lower of the two) faded away.   I was able to park and get out of my car and another neighbor joined me in observing the remaining ball of light.  It was stationary, but pulsating a reddish-orange light.  There was no sound.  This lasted about 5 minutes before it slowly faded away or burned out.   I know that there is a nuclear plant not too far away in that same direction, but I am not sure if there is any connection.;35.4740000000001;-80.8729000000001

All disappeared into nothing.  All were just beside the moon to the right.  Appeared to be possibly as far away as South Charlotte (25 miles), but it was hard to gauge.;35.4740000000001;-80.8729000000001
