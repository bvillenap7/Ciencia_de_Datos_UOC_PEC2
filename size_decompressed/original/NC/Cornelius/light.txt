A bright round light burst in the sky from out of nowhere.  It lit up the sky like a flood light but was gone as fast as it appeared.  It burned yellow, orange and red.  There was no sound, no moon and many stars visible in the sky.  It was positioned South of us, towards Charlotte/Huntersville.  We so no movement.

It lasted a matter of seconds.  It appeared to be just behind and above the treeline.  No trail.;35.4740000000001;-80.8729000000001
White light across Lake Norman.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-24 21:09:00;1 minute;White light across Lake Norman.   Single white light moving across the sky heading north from the Lake Norman region.  No sound, swayed from side to side a little bit.  Moving too fast to be a Chinese wish lantern, and to slow to be a aircraft.  I see a lot of plane activity over Lake Norman, but this was very strange, very strange indeed.
