We were having a party at a restaurant on Lake Norman and everyone walked out onto the dock and saw many slowly moving red objects coming overhead, from the North West.  They were too slow to be planes or shooting stars and too fast to be hot air balloons.  They were red lights that looked relatively large and were all traveling in a group. There was a cloud directly overhead of us and as all of the U.F.O.s passed it, they all disappeared at the same spot!  It looked like they were burning out or turning off a light.  We did not see any U.F.O.s after they passed the cloud over head of us because all of their lights went out.  The duration of the event lasted from about 9:50 to 10:00 PM and after they all traveled past in that 10 minute time span, there were no more.;35.4740000000001;-80.8729000000001

My husband and I walked out to sidewalk to see it better and watched it moved slowly across the sky until we lost it.  Not sure if it went away or we lost it in the clouds.   Neither of us could come up with a rational explanation of what we had saw.;35.4740000000001;-80.8729000000001
