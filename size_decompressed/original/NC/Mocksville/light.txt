Bright light hovering over tree line;2004-04-04 23:20:00;4 minutes;Bright light hovering over tree line Bright light, yellowish gold tint, larger than the north star with no sound.  It hovered over the tree line for a few minutes and the light went out.  Numerous planes were flying around the area.  This is the third time I have seen this in the last four months, on those dates it did not go out, would just move horizontal, stop, move forward, stop, move vertical, etc... there is never any sound and the light is always consistent in strength, never dimming until this event when it just cut off.
