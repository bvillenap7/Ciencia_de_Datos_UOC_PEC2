Bright white object seen with one bright white missile-like object shooting out from the bottom;2006-12-27 02:00:00;2 min.;Bright white object seen with one bright white missile-like object shooting out from the bottom I woke at 2:00 am and, looking out of my bedroom window, I noticed a bright white object moving slowly through the sky.  I was looking N/NW and the object appeared to be traveling east toward Winston-Salem, NC.  It appeared to be about 20-30 miles away but it was hard to tell and was flying at a height that I usually associate with local planes and jets that are landing at the airport in Winston. It caught my attention that the object (which I assumed to be a plane) didn’t seem to have any of the usual lights required for aircraft.  I lost sight as the object passed on the side of my house so I got up and went to a large window in the front of my house (which faces east) to see the object as it came back into view.  It seemed to turn slightly south and I could finally see a flashing red light on it but the flash was not steady but rather erratic. I watched it for 15 more seconds or so and then (to my amazement) a white light that I can only describe as looking like a missile (or a laser) shot out from the bottom straight toward the ground.  Needless to say, a burst of adrenaline went through me!  At first I thought a plane had dropped a bomb on the outskirts of Winston and that we might be under attack on our on soil---I stood looking at the sky for awhile and observed nothing else unusual.  The object traveled on and I lost sight of it in the tree line. The next morning I had to travel to Tennessee and when I arrived at my parents’ home, I asked them if anything had been said on the news about a bomb (or whatever) being dropped near Winston-Salem------that’s how unnerved I was.;35.9185;-80.5386999999998
