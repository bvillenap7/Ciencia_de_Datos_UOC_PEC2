UFO and alien sighting;2003-01-01 01:30:00;1 min;UFO and alien sighting   Honestly this is not a hoax.  Back in 2003 when my wife and I lived in Mocksville I believe I had an encounter with aliens.  I remembered seeing two very strange looking creatures standing at the foot of my bed!  I closed my eyes and reopened them and they were gone.  I thought maybe I had still been dreaming so I went back to sleep, but it took awhile as I was a little freaked out.  The next morning I got about 7:00 AM to get my shower before I left for work.  When I got in the shower and the water ran down my leg I noticed a burning feeling on the back of my left leg.  When I turned my leg around to see what it was I had a perfect 2 X 2 square of hair missing on my leg and it was a little red???  I'm not sure what exactly happened that night, but needless to say it freaked me totally out.  My wife is the only other person I have told about this, because I figured people would think I'm crazy.  About a year later I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom.  While using the bathroom I noticed a white light zipping across the sky.  As I began to stare at it, the object completely stopped.  About 30 seconds later it took off again so fast I almost lost track of it.  I got my wife up and showed it to her.  Neither of us had any idea what in the world it could be since there are no aircrafts that I know of that can move like that.
