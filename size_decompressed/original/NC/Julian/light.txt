One point of light moving from south to north causing a scattering of light effect similar to something entering the atmosphere at high speed (like a bullet entering water in slow motion) yet the night was clear and no other air craft presented this quality. The light then broke into two separate lights moving further away from each other with two more subsequent lights “breaking away” and moving in a N/NE direction.;35.9563;-79.637
