What is this;2004-04-23 17:30:00;10 minutes;What is this My wife and I was sitting on our back deck it was around 7:30pm on April 23 I looked up and saw a small white dot about the size of a pencil eraser. My first thought was it’s an airplane but it did not look right it was at a very high altitude I asked my wife to take a look and she did not know what it could be. I continued to watch it and I notice a second one heading in a direct path toured the first one. At this time I realize it could not be two planes flying that close tours each other then when they past each other which looked like to be about a ¼” something wasn’t right. I ran in the house and grabbed my camera and took two photos of the second one they both were moving what seemed to be very fast. I have never believed in UFO’s and I gave thought of sending the pictures to someone but I did not. Then this morning I was watching the news and they showed the pictures taken in Mexico and man what I saw was scary because the pictures look just like what I saw.  So I am sending you two photo’s hope they can help but the quality is not very good. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.   Thank you:;35.811;-78.0908
