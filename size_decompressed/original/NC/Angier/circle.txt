Circular Blue object appearing in the sky;2016-08-10 21:34:00;10 seconds;Circular Blue object appearing in the sky My family and I were driving home from eating out and I saw a blue circular object flash across the sky for several(approx. 5-10) seconds.  The circular object had a blue aura and it was seen briefly.  There were no aircrafts present at the time of sighting.  I am not making this up.  Both my father and I saw the object and it completely disappeared after the time previously stated.;35.4897;-78.7249000000001
