Fiery orange/red ord traveling across the sky;2012-11-16 10:42:00;1.5 minutes;Fiery orange/red ord traveling across the sky Fiery orange/red orb appeared south east of our home.  It was extremely large (making venus look small in the sky) it moved in a rather fast clip across the sky toward the west and eventually changed directions and headed south, we lost track of it after that due to the tree line.  It had no sound at all and seemed to pulse, like an ember from a fire. This is the second time we have seen this exact same thing.  The first time was 11/2 at 9:47pm and it appeared to ascend into the sky at the same location as the 11/16 object, however this first time it rapidly traveled north and eventually faded out. Again, it had no sound.;35.6509;-81.2391000000001

It moved rapidly but I managed to get my seven year old daughter in position before it passed where we could not see. It might have been a Mylar balloon, but it was moving way too fast for what I know.;35.6509;-81.2391000000001
