Small Silver Floating Eggs seen in NC;2005-06-25 12:01:00;4 min.;Small Silver Floating Eggs seen in NC Small silvery egg shaped sphere was seen that almost looked like an insect but moved about like a hovering craft.  I've never seen an insect look like a small silvery egg before.  It moved real strange, like it was hovering and would dart off real quick.  Was around 2 inches in diameter.  After seeing this craft I saw strange visions of earthquakes and great destruction coming to the earth.  I also kept hearing the 'year of great change' repeat over in my head.  I'm a professional computer expert who is not prone to hallucinations or hearing voices in my head. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));35.6509;-81.2391000000001
