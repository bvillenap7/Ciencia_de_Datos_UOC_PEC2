Fast Moving Fireball with Long tail, like a Jet stream moving in the sky.;2013-06-01 22:30:00;10 seconds;Fast Moving Fireball with Long tail, like a Jet stream moving in the sky My Room-Mate and I , had decided to take a break from a movie, and step outside for a cigarette. The sky appeared clear, a lot of stars were visible, perhaps just a few clouds.  The night was warm, and very little to almost no wind that we could notice across our skins. I Looked up, and the first words out of my Mouth were “W-T” I hand not finished, when she looked up and saw the same thing. It appeared as a single fireball, heading from South-East to North-West, in a rapid horizontal direction, It was like a rock or disk or something, with the halo of fire orange, and a tail behind it. The event in itself lasted less then 10 seconds, and it seemed to have completely disappeared or faded into the atmosphere or behind a cloud.;35.6509;-81.2391000000001
