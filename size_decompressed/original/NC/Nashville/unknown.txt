Bright Lights Over Nashville, NC;2012-09-10 05:00:00;6;Bright Lights Over Nashville, NC At the time of the sighting I was delivering news papers for the Rocky Mount Telegram.  While delivering papers on Womble Rd. in Nashville, NC I noticed two bright lights in the sky about 5-10 miles away from me.  The lights resembled that of an commercial airliner with the landing lights on.  While I observed the crafts I noticed that they were hovering. At that time I started to realize the this was a UFO.  They then started to move in a zig-zag pattern over a great distance in a matter of seconds.  Then as I'm staring one of the crafts comes towards me at a very high rate of speed.  The craft then flies over the field next to me (by this time the bright lights was no longer emitted from the craft) moving very slowly with a flashing blue light on the bottom of the craft.  There was no sound.  The craft then disappeared behind the trees.  I will remember this for the rest of my life.;35.9843;-77.9595
Have never seen anything this bright and fast in the sky.;2018-03-03 19:20:00;20 seconds;Have never seen anything this bright and fast in the sky. First, saw a bright white, stationary light in the sky, after a few seconds it appeared to be heading west at a high rate of speed...we were going 75 MPH in a westward direction.   It did not have any flashing lights and was not an airplane.  The light was very, very bright and FAST.;35.9843;-77.9595
