Four orange lights seem in Graham county, North Caroline.;2007-06-28 21:30:00;5 minutes;Four orange lights seem in Graham county, North Caroline. My husband and I saw 4 orange lights horizontally lined up on the side of a mountain.  Our cabin is situated on top of a smaller mountain so that when looking out our sliding glass door the lights were even with us.  My first reaction was thinking someone put up a lift with largr orange lights on it.  Then the lights moved up the mountain and into the night sky.  One moved off quickly and the other 3 formed a triangle over the mountain.  They held that position briefly, then took off quickly one at a time.  There was a white flash under each as they took off.;35.3278;-83.7833
