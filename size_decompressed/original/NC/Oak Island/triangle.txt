Orange cresent craft traveling west to east at Oak Island,North Carolinat at 10:45 p.m. 8/12/12;2012-08-12 22:45:00;5 minutes;Orange cresent craft traveling west to east at Oak Island,North Carolinat at 10:45 p.m. 8/12/12 At approximately 10:45 p.m. on 8/12/12 on the back side of Oak Island, a bright, orange aircraft approached from the west and moved in a straight path, much like an airplane would travel. It's speed did not excelerate but seemed to slow at intervals. There was a kind of &quotbouncing&quot or &quotsmall movement&quot of the craft as it moved in front of us. It could have been a rotation.  There was no sound of any kind. We watched it travel immediately infront of us, and continued east for about 4-5 minutes. Then it turned north and as it turned in that direction, the speed increased and it disappeared within a few seconds, it looked as though it went straight up and out of sight. There was nothing to distort or block our view, as our house sits on the back of Oak Island with water and marsh only.  This was not a reflection, nor was it a meteor, as was our reason for being outside ( perseid shower). This was a large craft, boomerang shaped,or cresent.Ther! e was only one craft and the color reminded me of a candle flame. Both myself and my friend are in the medical field, my friend is retired and I am a nurse.Neither of us have ever seen anything like this before, nor would we have believed what we saw except for the fact we both saw and witnessed the same thing.;33.9142;-78.1280999999999
