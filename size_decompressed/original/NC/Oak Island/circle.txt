Red-orange circular objects seen in southern sky over ocean off of Oak Island, NC;2016-02-20 20:30:00;45 minutes;Red-orange circular objects seen in southern sky over ocean off of Oak Island, NC On April 20, 2016, from about 8:30 PM to about 9:15 PM, we saw at least ten red-orange colored circle shaped objects appear at about 15 or 20 degrees over the ocean horizon in the southern direction.  The circles would suddenly appear (sometimes one at a time)and then quickly disappear.  It was almost impossible to ascertain if it was moving or another one lighting up.  Several times more than 5 appeared rather far apart in space yet, short in lighted time duration.  Some of the circles quickly flickered while others appeared stationary and simply faded away.  It was obvious they were not flares since there were no tails or trails of any sort and the circle had crisp and distinct edges.  The event went on and off for about 30 - 45 minutes.  The sky was starlight and an almost full moon was about 35 degrees above horizon in the eastern direction of the sky.  Some planets were also visible. It was quite obvious the color and size was much, much different than any of tho! se. When the circles disappeared they seemed to cave in upon themselves at times.  Other times they disappeared quickly.  The events ended as quickly as they started.  After events an aircraft appeared to be returning from the general area.  This aircraft was viewed for a long time and had mostly red lights un-like all other aircraft in the sky.

Mostly orange-red circular objects appeared in southern sky over ocean near Oak Island, NC.;2016-04-26 20:30:00;30 minutes;Mostly orange-red circular objects appeared in southern sky over ocean near Oak Island, NC. Between 8:30 PM and 9:30 PM off of Oak Island, NC, in the southern sky at about 15-20 degrees we saw red-orange objects appear in the sky.  They would suddenly appear then disappear in a duration of seconds.  They appeared to jump or dance in sky.  Stars and planets were visible at the time and it was quite evident the color and larger shapes of these circular objects was different from all other objects in the sky.  The objects were mostly orange with a red tint and would appear and disappear within seconds.  No types of flare trails or tails were part of the event.  Some would blink and others appeared to cave in upon themselves;33.9142;-78.1280999999999

Mostly orange-red circular objects appeared in southern sky over ocean near Oak Island, NC;2016-04-28 20:34:00;12 minutes;Mostly orange-red circular objects appeared in southern sky over ocean near Oak Island, NC Seven red-orange circles appeared in the sky about 15-20 degrees above the horizon in southern direction over the ocean off of Oak Island, NC.  These objects appeared first as 4 circles at 8:34 PM then others (or some of the same) again at 8:47 PM.  The objects appeared rapidly out of nowhere and then disappeared within 5 seconds.  The circles all appeared each as a large filled in circle of red-orange color.  They all seemed to appear and disappear in the same general area (but not exactly the same)of the sky.  At one point two were side by side before disappearing.  They all seemed to disappear by collapsing into themselves.  The two that were side-by-side appeared to have a halo around them.  All circles were filled in with the same color and appeared to be large.;33.9142;-78.1280999999999
Bright lights appeared off the coast, multiplied, disappeared, and a single light reappeared and vanished again.;2020-06-29 21:00:00;15 seconds;Bright lights appeared off the coast, multiplied, disappeared, and a single light reappeared and vanished again. We were driving down Beach Dr near 46th St SE when a set of white-red lights appeared off the coast, roughly 10,000 ft and several miles from the shoreline.  Initially there were three lights, but as two of the lights got closer together they became 4.  One light stayed alone to the East.  Then the five lights came together and disappeared.  Roughly 3 seconds later, a larger light appeared and then disappeared as quickly as it came.  They never reappeared.;33.9142;-78.1280999999999
