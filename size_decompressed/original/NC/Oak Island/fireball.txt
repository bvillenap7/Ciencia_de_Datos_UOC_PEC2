Huge light source, movement, flashing lights seen over Oak Island, North Carolina;2007-02-24 19:00:00;20 minutes;Huge light source, movement, flashing lights seen over Oak Island, North Carolina Have eighteen digital photos of the objects.  One large object, two small objects.  Smaller objects moved about the area.  At times from the large object, you could observe flashing lights and light rays.  One instance of red flashing lights.  Looked to be a large white object with flashing lights, but when magnified to 800 X it appeared to be something much different!  Suddenly, shot up into the hemisphere at a unbelievable rate and disappeared.;33.9142;-78.1280999999999

3 fireballs or flare like lights above the ocean that quickly disappeared.;2019-05-16 21:15:00;5 seconds;3 fireballs or flare like lights above the ocean that quickly disappeared. I was staying with family this week at the beach on oak island.  I was out in front of thte beach house around 9:15 and saw three flare like lights to the Southwest (myrtle beach direction) but probably 10,000+ feet high. #1, then #2, then #3 appeared within a few seconds in a triangle formation then they disappeared very fast.  I’d say they could be flares but does the military typically drop flares off the coast this far from a base?  They didn’t last long like flares either.  It was very quick.  Literally right when I saw them they disappeared after 3 seconds.  Also heard no aircraft of any kind at all.;33.9142;-78.1280999999999
