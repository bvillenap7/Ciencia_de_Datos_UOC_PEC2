Yellow light moving north over Oak Island NC;2020-12-31 21:20:00;3 min;Yellow light moving north over Oak Island NC Yellow light moved from south to north and disappeared. As it passed the light turned red and faded out. It was brighter than a star or planet. It looked similar to landing light but no flashing wing lights were seen and I could hear no noise. Object appeared relatively low and certainly under 5000 feet. It kept on a straight path. Anyone else see this?;33.9142;-78.1280999999999
