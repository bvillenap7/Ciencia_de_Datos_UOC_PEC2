Blinking lights and orange orbs;2013-06-11 22:00:00;30 minutes;My husband and I (ages 50 and 48) were standing on the deck of an oceanfront home on Oak Island, which faces south.  My mother-in-law (age 70) was also present. We were watching lightning from a distant storm out at sea.  Out over the ocean, about 20 degrees above the horizon, we began seeing blinking white lights.  They looked like stars but they were moving erratically and blinking. After a few minutes, a bright orange orb appeared, and remained steady for several seconds then faded away.  This scenario repeated itself several times and at one point one of the orange orbs split into two and moved apart in a horizontal direction before fading away. At the end, we saw what may have been two aircraft leaving the area and heading west.  They were blinking, but moving in a steady direction.  Any sound they may have made was drowned out by the sound of the surf. We have witnessed this same phenomenon (the blinking lights and orange orbs) at other times in the past while at Oak Island, most recently last summer while at this same location with other family members.  We have witnessed the orange orbs on at least two other occasions from Oak Island during the past three years.;33.9142;-78.1280999999999
