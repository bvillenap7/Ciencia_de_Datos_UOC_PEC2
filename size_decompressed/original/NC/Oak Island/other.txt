Fifteen minutes later three glowing orange lights in a triangle formation appeared off to the east of the orginal sighting and began to descend slowly until disappearing.  Fifteen minutes later a single orang light appeared to the west at a lower point in the sky and descended slowly for several seconds.;33.9142;-78.1280999999999
Large fireballing flashes on and off. Smaller white flashes move across the sky at incredible rate.;2012-07-18 21:30:00;20:00;Large fireballing flashes on and off. Smaller white flashes move across the sky at incredible rate. First, we see a large yellow flash that lasted for about three seconds.  After reappearing, the flash would be in a slightly different location.  It did not move in any one direction.  After a longer pause of about five minutes, the flash or fireball object came again with the same general pattern.  Later we started to see small flashing lights that were white and looked like stars.  They seemed to stay in a group and moved across the sky at a faster rate than any plane could hope to go.  The smaller lights would follow each other around, often flashing more as the got closer together.  All of these events took place over the ocean and were seen from the beach.;33.9142;-78.1280999999999
Brightly lit, multi-light object flying in erratic pattern near seashore at Oak Island, NC;2015-07-09 20:00:00;5 minutes;Brightly lit, multi-light object flying in erratic pattern near seashore at Oak Island, NC While sitting on the seashore-facing deck of the beach house where I was vacationing, I saw a group of lights that all appeared to be attached to the same craft, though the craft itself wasn't visible, flying in a very erratic, humming bird kind of pattern.  There were two red lights that were constantly on, in addition to a pulsating white light that appeared to be almost like a landing or search light, accompanied by a series of blue, violet and green lights that pulsed intermittently.  It was completely silent, very bright and would hover at times while following a very erratic, non-linear flight path. It zigged and zagged and eventually flew off after a few minutes.  I thought it may have been a drone, but it was absolutely silent and, while it was hard to estimate the size, probably too large to be a drone.  At least not like the size of the drones that I've seen for sale to the general public.  I'm curious to know if other people witnessed what I saw.  I'm a photographer the other witnesses were a salesman, nurse and doctor of psychology.;33.9142;-78.1280999999999
