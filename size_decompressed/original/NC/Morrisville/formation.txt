Date: 12/16/2013 07:20 PM Location:   Backyard (Morrisville, NC) Who: My family (2 adults 3 children) including my father who was visiting.  We were out back enjoying a fire when I looked up and saw what at first looked like a flock of birds.  About 25-50 white objects were flying in formation over our heads.  They were silent and we did not see any wings moving.  It was a full moon and clear sky so its possible that the moon light was reflecting off the “birds” but I’ve never seen anything like this before, none of us had.   They moved at a slow steady pace and changed formation, it looked like a “V” formation that got wider as they floated by.  Another way to describe it was it looked like fish swimming in water, the objects did not move like normal birds.   A few seconds later another wave of objects flew by in the same fashion.  I suppose these objects could be what people refer to as “Orbs”.;35.8332;-78.8473000000001
