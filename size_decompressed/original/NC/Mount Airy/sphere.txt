Airy, next to Pilot Mountain, NC On Nov 19 at 6:35 PM we were driving on highway 103 going south toward Mt. Airy, Nc.  We saw A BLUE white orb with a darker shape behind it.  It was beside us on the right, twenty feet from the car.  It wove in and out of the trees at the same speed as we were traveling. (55-60MPH)  It blasted way up in the sky in front of us, (shooting left to get directly in front,) higher than the trees on the hills, then stopped and hovered for three seconds and then shot down, toward the right, behind the trees.  It was gone.  The whole thing last for thirty seconds. Our cell phones didn't work for several minutes.  We slowed down and saw a deer on the side of the road.  She was a huge doe and seemed very disoriented.  She was looking across the road, into the woods and didn't notice our car.  The fur on the left side of her neck seemed roughed up, like it was wet and pushed up.  She was solid brown (no white) and there were no other deer around her.  We had to swerve around her and she did not move or look away from the woods.;36.5002000000003;-80.6163000000006
