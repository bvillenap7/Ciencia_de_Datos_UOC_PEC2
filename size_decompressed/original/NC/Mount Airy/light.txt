Due to her recent outpatient surgery and her consumption of pain medication we ignored her when she first told us about the lights.  About ten minutes into the first movie I noticed small lights maneuvering strangely in the sky.  I quickly asked everyone else if they saw it too. To my astonishment they had been watching it for a while.  The objects where very fast and made pinpoint turns. Sometimes they flew in formations, sometimes they flew irradically.  They almost seemed to be chacing each other sometimes. Then other times they would be completely stationary.  They looked almost like fireflies.  Thats what I dismissed them as at first.  But then when a small cloud flew over i noticed that they where far above it. They seemed to be in space. I think this because at times they would fly in a large circle moving away from me and then back towards me.  When they flew to the backside of the circle they would dissapear, then a second later they would reapear on the opposite side.  Finally after about an hour of these acrobatics another craft appeared.  It was the same as the others and it approached them from the center of the sky.  When it came close to them they all stopped moving.  They remained motionless untill the other craft joined them. Then one by one they quickly streeked out of sight.;36.5002000000003;-80.6163000000006

Unidentifiable lights over NW North Carolina with constant rumbling, total of 12 over 2 and 1/2 hour time period.  Surry County.;2013-08-31 19:00:00;2.50 hours;Unidentifiable lights over NW North Carolina with constant rumbling, total of 12 over 2 and 1/2 hour time period.  Surry County. At approximately 8:30 pm, noticed large, very bright light in western sky.  This appeared to flash in cycles from bright light to red. and back.  It moved from just above treeline level to out of sight in about a 30 minute span of time. After this,3 smaller lights appeared more toward the southeast and stayed, hovering and then disappeared within 30 minutes. There were also 4 fast moving objects moving west to east and then south to north, each flashing white and red and moving so much faster than any plane we've ever seen.   This was witnessed by 5 people. At approximately 11 pm, we witnessed 4 new objects in the north sky,  3 of which were aligned and flasing, but hovering and the 4th was more toward the northwest sky and larger, also brighter and moved north to south alternately.   What really captivated us about these was that the object furthest north actually flashed very bright and disappeared, twice...before reappearing and maintaining the flashing pattern once again. Please note that the whole time this was going on, there was a rumbling sound that was CONSTANT.  It did not fade, like any normal jet or plane sound.;36.5002000000003;-80.6163000000006
Extremely large star/cross like light over NW North Carolina.;2013-09-15 20:00:00;40 minutes;Extremely large star/cross like light over NW North Carolina. Approximately 8pm, large star like object appeard in NW sky.  This object was huge.  It was star/cross like shape. I thought at first it was a star, but the sun had just started to go down and this was brighter than any star I've ever seen,and was the only thing in the sky, not even a cloud present.  It gradually moved NW until disappearing over a 40 minute period, so it moves very slowly but does move.  Almost like it is scanning the earth below it. We have witnessed this several times over the last 4 weeks and I just want to know what it is. It has appeared around the same time each evening and takes about 40 minutes to disappear.  On a couple other occasions there have been other smaller lights around this thing. I have photos, and my camera is just run of the mill digital Canon.  When I loaded the images to my computer and zoom in, the object seems to be changing shape in each photo (which was not detected by just observing it.)  The images are all different, some circular, some cigar like shape. I just want to know if anyone else is seeing this besides us and what it is.;36.5002000000003;-80.6163000000006
