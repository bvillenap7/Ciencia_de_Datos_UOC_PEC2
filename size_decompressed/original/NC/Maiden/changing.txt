Three lights changed formation.;2020-02-04 18:00:00;2 minutes;Three lights changed formation At approximately 6pm, I saw three lights In a line (white/blue) Completely stationary. Another light descended from the center and started moving left.  At this point I was stopped in the middle of the road and two cars came behind me so I had to turn left onto the road that I live on.  In the time that it took me to turn onto my road I looked backed and it had changed into a “V” formation and there was now 5 lights.  Still completely stationary, I watched them until I lost sight.  As soon as I got home I tried to get my drone up to get a better look but I couldn’t get it to connect to the camera.  Which has NEVER happened before.;35.5759;-81.1745000000001
