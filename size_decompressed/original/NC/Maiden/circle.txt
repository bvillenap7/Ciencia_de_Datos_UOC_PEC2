Strange Object/Light over Maiden, NC Area;2008-01-25 22:00:00;15 minutes;Strange Object/Light over Maiden, NC Area Hello,  Coming back from Charlotte on Hwy 16 last night (aprox 7:45-8:15pm) I saw an odd very bright light to my left, but figured it was a plane since I always see planes coming into Charlotte when I drive home from work each night. After about 20 minutes, I noticed it had not really moved, but now seemed to be flashing in someway, so I figured it was just a helicopter hovering, then again I wondered why it was there for so long. One thing I know for sure, it was not a star, and Iâ€™ve been gazing at the stars since I was a kid using my telescope. Upon arriving home I saw nothing more of it, but here is where it gets interesting. My 12 year old daughter was coming back from a birthday event in Newton (at aprox 10pm), she and 3 other kids, along with the mother saw a very bright light and it seemed to be near them, perhaps following them (of course this was according to the kids being that the mom was driving and could not tell for sure).  Ok, so my 12 year old daughter pulled out her 7.1mp camera and took several photos of this object. The first one is very interesting (you be the judge), but the next few photos were not so great, (i.e. look like a photo of a star perhaps).  I wanted to send both photos your way just in case you felt it was news worthy.  Again, I did not see the object as clearly as my daughter did, but her photo seems to look alot like a UFO, well at least from there perspective, it was an Unidentified Flying Object, right?  Please review the photos and let me know what you think?  Thanks.;35.5759;-81.1745000000001
