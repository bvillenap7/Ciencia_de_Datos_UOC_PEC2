Orange bright orb in NW Sky above Maiden NC  Every Night moving erratically - ongoing.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Venus??  PD));2020-03-02 19:30:00;3 hours;Orange bright orb in NW Sky above Maiden NC Every Night moving erratically - ongoing For the past several weeks, beginning in mid February, almost every night around sunset until approximately 22:00 hours there is a spherical light that rises and moves erratically until it reaches a certain point/altitude and stops.  It then moves occasionally, sometimes quickly but with a jerky or erratic movement.  It remains in the sky for approximately 2-3 hours and then moves or descends.  At first I thought it was a drone and then possibly a weather balloon.  It appears in the North West sky almost nightly. We have also seen an identical craft in the North sky that appears around a half hour after the first, but then disappears from our view.  I have looked for reasonable explanations, but can’t find any.  We can’t be the only people seeing this because it’s been happening for several weeks.  It’s in the direct path of aircraft coming to the Charlotte Douglas Airport, but appears to be either much higher or much lower altitude.  It appears to be much lower.  I attempted filming it, but don’t have the right equipment.  I’m going to attempt again as it is still appearing.;35.5759;-81.1745000000001
