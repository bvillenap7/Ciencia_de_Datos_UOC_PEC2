Unknown Lights  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the star, Sirius.  PD));2004-02-02 21:00:00;3 OR 4 HOURS;Unknown Lights We witnesses 2 very bright white lights that shifted color from white to amber then to orange then blue with colors spinning around the outside of it. We dismissed the objects at first as planes, then noticed that they did not move like planes. These objects moved slowly towards each other in a random zigzag pattern from the east horizon towards the west, then back away from each other until they flashed out of site. We noticed as the objects got closer to each other they turned an orange color and seemed to pulse.  We have tried to tape and photograph hese objects before but cannot with any success as each time we try to focus in the camera batteries drain totally out, and these are new batteries!
