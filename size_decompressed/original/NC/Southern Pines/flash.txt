Erraticly moving craft emmitting light pulses.;2001-03-20 23:45:00;10 - 15 min;Erraticly moving craft emmitting light pulses. Traveling Southbound on US Highway 1, towards Richmond County.  Light pulses coming from the southwest.  Pulses increased in intensity until last flash, then light source dissappeared.  Sourse of light moving at an indeterminate speed.  Ft. Bragg is located approximately 30 miles from the area, but the source of the light was too erratic to be military.  Light source was definetely not ground based (i.e. search lights) and the movement was not the sort a low flying helicopter would make.;35.1784541062804;-79.3938236714977
Blue star burst that lasted about 2 seconds with a sonic boom, no smoke trail .Very clean light .;2004-09-20 22:20:00;2seconds;Blue star burst that lasted about 2 seconds with a sonic boom, no smoke trail.  Very clean light . I was outside burning a cig. Eyes were already adjusted to the darkness. Looking up in the sky just pondering. Heard a boom as if it might be a 105 cannon but felt no shock from Fort Bragg. I know those sounds well for I work on Fort Bragg, NC. Sound was up in the air high, felt as if it was back behind me about 40 miles second boom about 0.5 seconds after the first Any how , Looked up and saw a Blue star burst in the ESE sky. Burst lasted about 1-2 seconds and looked as if it was up there at about 40 degree angle at about the 50 thousand foot height flight area. Size of object was about the size of a quarter and lasted about 2 seconds. Very clean blue light with bright white in center of blue burst. Blue light ring looked as as if the middle of it was being sucked out of it. Sky was/is clear with no clouds , unlimited vis., can see all stars tonight , no moon and very little ground light, temp ~65F, No smoke trail or fire trail as in a shooting star, no smoke trail as when the troops drop flares in the sky at night for night drops, No secondary light as when they send up a flash flair, they have some trailing light after they go off. Could see regular stars after the blue burst dissipated in 2 seconds. Do not contact me, just giving you the information for you to compute if there are/ were other sightings of this tonight on the East coast.;35.1784541062804;-79.3938236714977
