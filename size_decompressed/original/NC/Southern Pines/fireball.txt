Very large green fireball moving through the sky.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  PD));2015-07-30 00:30:00;Few seconds;Very large green fireball moving through the sky. A friend and I were walking around in Weymouth woods.   As we came out into a clearing, suddenly I witnessed a brilliantly lit green fireball in the sky to the west.  The fireball appeared to be very large in size and seemed to be falling from space.   For a moment after it disappeared I expected to hear an explosion, however, there was none.
