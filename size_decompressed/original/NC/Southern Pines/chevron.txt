Chevron sighting with lost time and nightmares;2016-08-22 21:00:00;15 minutes;Chevron sighting with lost time and nightmares Around 9pm I went outside to smoke a cigarette and saw 2 UFOs. One was in the shape of a chevron that changed colors and one was a line of lights that was yellow. They were flying low, and I felt slightly sick and I don’t remember going inside my house but I woke up in my living on the couch to a horrible nightmare of being surrounded by something several hours later. I’ve never had an experience like it before or sense but I still have vivid nightmares of the same event.  I don’t know what was real and my memory is spotty.  And when I think about it still get physically ill.;35.1784541062804;-79.3938236714977
