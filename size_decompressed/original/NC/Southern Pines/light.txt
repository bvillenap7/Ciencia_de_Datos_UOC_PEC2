Our sighting was on Wednesday, April 30 at 8:50 PM EST. It took place about 6 miles north of Southern Pines, NC.  We saw several blotches of white light in an eliptical pattern in the sky to our left as we traveled North.  We were both startled.  As we moved forward about 30 yards, we lost the lights in the trees.  When we cleared the trees, and as my wife was preparing to turn left, I saw only one light in the same place.  It was a much larger light, about 20% as large as the moon.  It hovered for an instant and then took off across the sky as fast as a meteor.  There were clouds in the north and I assume it went behind those clouds.  I also assumed that the lights had merged when I caught sight of the light after clearing the trees although I did not see that take place.  The light covered about 15 degrees as it streaked across the sky before it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time above to 20:50 hrs..  We spoke with the witnesses, and found them to be quite credible.  Their description of what they had seen was quite objective and unambiguous.  PD));35.1784541062804;-79.3938236714977
