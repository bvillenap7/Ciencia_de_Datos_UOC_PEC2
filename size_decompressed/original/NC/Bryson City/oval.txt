I was at a cabin located nearly at the top of a mountain, in Bryson City, NC.  While taking photos, I was facing East. I saw some unusual cloud shapes, including one that looked like a little circle or oval-shaped cloud and I did not notice anything else unusual, other than the shape of the cloud, until I went back and looked at the pictures again. I took a photo of the sky, and then took other photos. My husband, who was there with me and also believed it to be a cloud, said he watched it move across the sky, in the same direction as the clouds, but much more quickly. In images as little as one minute later, all of the other clouds are still present but there is no sign of the oval-shaped one.;35.4311;-83.4418000000001
