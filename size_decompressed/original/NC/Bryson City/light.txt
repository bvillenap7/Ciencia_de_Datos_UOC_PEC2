Zig zagging star- lights in North Carolina sky.;2018-08-12 03:00:00;2 + hours;Zig zagging star- lights in North Carolina sky Was out watching the Perseid meteor shower last night between 145-545am at the top of our mountain which is approximately 3,000 ft above sea level here in Bryson City, NC. I spotted what looked to me like a very small, star-like light that appeared to be very tiny or far away moving up & down and in a zig zag erratic motions of which no satellite or plane is capable to my knowledge.  It almost looked like it was shimmying up and around the sky, it looked  weightless, as if it was moving in space or through water.  My fiance agreed with me that it was in fact moving and we even used a stationary object to judge its movements to and around the sky.  It didn't cover much space it just seemed it be in the same general area of sky.  Honestly it was so small and far away, I wouldn't have ever noticed it had I not been looking for the meteors.   25 minutes after we noticed that one we spotted another small light moving in the same erratic zig zag movements but instead of staying in one area it went from our right vision in the sky directly to the left, over the course of about no more than 5 minutes.  Then disappeared.  Both objects looked the same and moved the same way.;35.4311;-83.4418000000001
