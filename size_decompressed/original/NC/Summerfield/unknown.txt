Driving home through Summerfield, NC, I saw lights in the sky.  At first I dismissed them as lights on a water tower.  As I drove I realized there were no towers where I was. I drove towards the lights and tried to get a better idea of what I was seeing.  I finally got below a couple and thought   I may have heard a faint humming below them, but I am not sure.  There was one light per whatever they were and the light was a bright reddish orange and appeared to be about the size of a softball.;36.2245000000001;-79.8901000000002
