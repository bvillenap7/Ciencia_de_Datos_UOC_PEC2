Spherical object enters atmosphere and flies away.;2021-01-29 16:00:00;15-30 minutes;Spherical object enters atmosphere and flies away. While driving in the country, in Summerfield, NC, my employee and I saw a peculiar sight: An object high in the sky with a downward trajectory, with an orange glow surrounding it and trailing behind it. After about 15 minutes, the object slowed down and changed its trajectory, the orange glow gone. It traveled at similar speed to an aircraft, creating a white trail similar to how airliners do as it traveled.;36.2245000000001;-79.8901000000002

I was in the back yard of my parents house, on the deck,  looking through binoculars at a tiny flickering light about a mile away in the woods, trying to figure out what it was.  I put the binoculars down, then glanced up to my right side, up in the sky about 10 feet above tree level, in the back yard of the house, and I saw a big green glowing sphere of light that illuminated the clouds behind it.  It split into 2 glowing spheres, and then they moved away from each other in opposite directions.  I freaked out and went running into the house, for my dad to come see, and when we went back outside, it was gone.  The spheres were about the size of the moon when it’s low on the horizon, and were glowing green like a traffic light.  The whole incident lasted about 1-2 seconds, and I couldn’t believe I was seeing it so close.  I have never seen anything like this before and have been racking my brain trying to figure out a logical explanation for what I saw.;36.2245000000001;-79.8901000000002
