a total of 7 flashing or glowing orbs apeared and then disapeared out of thin air, i was very much in shock for a few days.;2009-09-29 22:00:00;20 minutes;a total of 7 flashing or glowing orbs apeared and then disapeared out of thin air, i was very much in shock for a few days. I was coming home from a vistiting a family member, and it was around 10pm. I was sitting in the back seat of my an SUV with my younger brother and younger sister. I was looking out of the window into the sky looking at planes fly above us. I glanced over a red flashing light. I thought i was a plane until i took a good look at it. As i began to focus on it, the flashing ball begain to flash several different colors. The flashing ball was flashing the colors red, blue, and green over and over again. No way this couldn't have been a plane because the lights were flashing so fast. I leaned over to my brother and told him to look out of my window and he gasped and said,  What is that? We told My younger sister, Who was driving, to glance over at look at it. She looked at it and said it was most likely a plane. My brother and i continued to look at the flashing ball. Unexpectedly, The one flashing ball turned into two. The first flashing had another flashing ball seam to emerge from it. The same thing happend a few more times and then there was were 6 glowing, flashing balls. I wanted to tell my younger sister to look out the window again to prove that it wasn't a plane, it was something else but i couldn't talk, no matter how much i wanted to, i couldn't talk. i was in shock of what was going on. almost imediantly, they formed two triangles then they zoomed away so fast i can't even think of how fast they were going. it was there and then gone just like that. I knew it didn't disapear because it had a path of light behind it like jets but instead of a white stream, it was colorful just like the colors that it was fashing. five minutes l! ater my brother and i saw another White/teal orb that had a white glow around it. this wasn't like the other orbs, it didn't have other orbs coming out if it, it didn't move it just hovered int the same spot then it slowly disapeared. i was in so much shock becuase i didn't belive in ufo's ever. i thought that people just made up theses stories and i witnessed it. I was in so much shock that i didn't talk for a few days after the experiance. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933
