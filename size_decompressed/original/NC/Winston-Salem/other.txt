I commute to work. My drive is about an hour and a half on the interstate so I've started breaking up my trip home by taking a secondary highway at the halfway point. I was on 150 East in Davidson County and just happened to be looking at the sky out of my driver's side window when an object seemed to streak out of the sky towards the trees an undetermined number of miles away... without falling from all that far up. And it didn't leave a residue trail like something that large would leave. It fell from (roughly) south to north at a steep angle maybe a couple of thousand feet, nowhere near tens of thousands, or from orbit. All this happened very fast and I would have discounted it as a meteor except that right before it disappeared from my sight into the trees or whatever it landed in, a really bright tinier flash of green emanated from it and it looked like it actually slowed down. I observed no impact sound, vibration, or light. After that I kept looking at the sky around my car. I noticed a few minuted later that heading from my north and east was a craft that could have been an airplane--it looked like it was up there a few thousand feet and it wasn't flying erratically or extremely fast. What caused me to pay attention to this craft, though, was that its headlight (white) was blinking in a signal pattern I've not seen airplanes use. As it flew above me I observed that the placement of the port and starboard lights as compared to airplanes I've seen was... well that thing either had really short wings or it was triangular in shape. I watched it off and on for a good three minutes maybe more before it left my field of vision.  (Approx. 35 deg. 53'19N by 80deg.19'33W);36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933
Motionless winged black aircraft;2010-05-09 12:00:00;5 minutes;Motionless winged black aircraft Hi, About three summers ago, I was driving from Winston Salem NC to Charlotte NC.  A beautiful day about 12:00 pm.  Before I left, I opened all the windows and sunroof (forgot camera). At some point in the trip, I looked up thru the sunroof.  I noticed a small black object fairly high up nearly overhead.  It appeared to be a small winged plane. About a half mile further down the interstate, I looked up and the object was at about the same position as before.  Concentrating on it I saw the wings and tail fins more accurately and said to my self how odd they looked compared to any other plane I had ever seen.  I pulled over and stopped. Still looking at it overhead through the sunroof, I realized it was motionless!  I got out of my car to continue my observation of this black object (I was hoping some other motorist might stop to see what this guy was looking up at.) In the Navy, I was a 2nd Class Fire Control Technician my action station was in the Fire Control Director at the controls and optics.  I had seen many planes in the sky and had a good feel for distance from my ship to them.  My thinking (at the time of the sighting) was that if this was the typical size of a fighter jet it must have been about &gt1500 feet straight up. I stared at it for about a minute looked up and down the interstate glanced up and it had disappeared. The front/back of the object had a more sharp point than the attached rendering. What stood out for me was that it was motionless and the stabilizers were the same width with the ends being parallel and in-line.

Lighted object, shaped like a plane, in a nosedive.;2016-10-17 19:30:00;30 minutes;Lighted object, shaped like a plane, in a nosedive. Was driving from Kernersville, NC to Winston-Salem, NC. Observed object south of Business 40 that from a distance appeared to shaped like a plane - but the plane would have been in a nosedive. Object appeared to be lit up. Object appeared to travel in front of us heading West on Business 40 to the west side of Winston-Salem, and disappeared in the West-Northwest horizon after approx. 30 minutes that we were driving. Object did not appear to be moving, but distance wise it would have had to have been moving. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE)) Yes.  We were driving from Kernersville thru Winston-Salem (west side), stopped at my house (5-10 minutes) and then drove to my father-in-laws house. We therefore did not see it continuously - but are confident that it was the same object. It appeared to be some distance from the vehicle, up in the air (maybe 2 to 5 miles away) and, therefore, moving rather slow (too slow for an airplane at night) ((END ADDENDUM;36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933
