Great big orange reddish ball.;2006-04-03 13:00:00;2 minutes;Great big orange reddish ball The backround was very cloudy because of thunderstorms.  I saw this bright orange/red ball float around.  I had no idea what it was so I stood up and kept on looking at it.  It was moving pretty fast - comparing to looking at an airplane move.  Then it just moved farther and farther away.  So I left the building and kept on watching it until it was just a white spot in the sky...  It was moving towards the east/northeast.  I looked it up on the internet and very well could have been a lightning ball, but this thing was hovering, weirdest thing Ive ever seen.

At first glance, I thought they were hot air balloons though I thought it odd they would be flying at night, especially on the 4th with fireworks going off.  They were traveling in sets of two, maintaining their distance from eachother.  They appeard to be glowing balls of fire.   When I got home a few minutes later I watched the first set go off into the distance until I could no longer see them, then the first glow in the second set faded away, the second glow did the same.   Then I observed another set of two follow the same path and fade away as well.;36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933

Once it got above my house it fizzled out..  it started out a fire color but then it was white.   My room mate recorded it on his phone.. which doesn't do it justice...  no sound.. nothing else around it..  no tail...   this is now the 2nd weird sighting in my back yard.  The 1st was about 4 months ago when what looked like a star appeared. . then it got very very bright and big and went outâ€¦;36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933
Six fireballs flying in a cluster.;2016-05-13 21:30:00;5 minutes;Six fireballs flying in a cluster. There were six orb-like objects.  At first I thought they were airplanes but upon closer look they were something entirely different.  They flew in a cluster and didn't seem to be going with the wind current, but they weren't flying like normal planes either.  They were a little shaky, and they didn't flicker like planes.;36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933
