On October 3, 2019,  between 6:55 p.m. and 7:20 p.m., myself and at least 4 other people observed 4 oblong or pod shape or pill shape or cigar shape flying objects.  The objects  changed from bright red to silver-like color in the clear, almost cloudless sky above the Fulton YWCA soccer field in Winston-Salem, NC, where children were practicing soccer. The objects were definitely not airplanes as they were very close and moving too slow and would have fallen from the sky. There were no wings or smoke trails.  They were not drones because the objects would get larger and then small again.  The objects seemed to appear out of nowhere.  They would randomly disappear in plain sight and reappear from nowhere.  One of the objects did take off across the same area of the sky very fast and then slow down again. The objects all moved horizontally and not vertically, not  upward nor downward.  Two of the objects seemed to fly within the particular area of the sky and stop (or disappear and then reappear) and then fly back facing the other objects in close proximity of each other.  I watched three disappear in the sky and not return to view.  The fourth one finally moved beyond the tall tree tops where I could no longer observe it. During the approximate 25 minutes, myself and another observer tried to take pictures or videos of the objects with our cell phones to no avail.  People other than the 4 of us who observed the flying objects seemed oblivious to the objects being there, as if it was commonplace to see such objects.  No one else seemed to care.  I showed the 4 objects to my granddaughter, but she was more interested in a grasshopper she had spotted in the grass.;36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933
