Black disk shaped object seen in broad daylight in Winston-Salem, NC;2002-06-28 19:00:00;10 minutes;Black disk shaped object seen in broad daylight in Winston-Salem, NC As  low clouds were moving across the sky (about 30 minutes before a thunderstorm) my family was grilling outside on the deck. As I looked up to look at the clouds I looked directly at a black disk shaped object in the sky. At first, the object seemed to follow the direction of the clouds, but after a couple of minutes it began to move ahead of the clouds. It continued this for a couple of minutes and then started to move upward and back towards the clouds. It then seemed to move upward more and disappeared. We were able to  look at the object through binoculars and say the it appeared to be disk shaped and at one point my nephew saw it tilted on it's side. The object slowly dissappeared in the clouds after about ten minutes.;36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933
