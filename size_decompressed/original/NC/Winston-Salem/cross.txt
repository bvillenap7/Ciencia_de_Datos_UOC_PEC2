Stationary bright white light;2013-10-27 20:30:00;20 minutes;Stationary bright white light Saw a bright white object that was stationary in the SW sky.  Shaped like a circle but with long outer bands which reminds me of the Christmas star depicted in the Bible.  Stayed completely stationary the entire duration.  I went inside my home and came out a few minutes later and it was gone.  Have noticed on this forum that the same object was sighted in a nearby county.;36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933
