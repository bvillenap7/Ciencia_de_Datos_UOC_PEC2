My sister and I witnessed 7 orbs traveling in a defined arc orbit overhead on 7/4/14.  They were approx 10,000 ft high and were sighted in groups of 2-1-2-2 floating by headed southeast.   Friends later told me they had sighted similar glowing shapes at Carolina Beach by midnight.;36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933
