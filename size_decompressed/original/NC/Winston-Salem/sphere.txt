Bright Orange/Yellow ball in the sky.;2005-06-15 01:00:00;1 hour;Bright Orange/Yellow ball in the sky. Bright Orange/Yellow ball of fire/or craft hovering in the night sky.  Clear night, the moon was on the other end of the sky, and I could see plenty of stars.  This one light was pretty sizable, if i held a dime in my hand and held it to the sky it would be about that big, and was pretty far away if i had to guess.  It was basically hovering with no noticable movement until I went inside to grab a cigarette and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933

At first, I thought it was a planet until I realized it was way outside the ecliptic, and then I thought I needed to check what star could possible be that bright.  I looked away for a moment to check on my dog and when I looked back, I thought it was gone until it reappeared and then seemed to flicker/spark and was gone.  It was not moving so it was definitely not a meteor however, the flickering out was very similar to the way a meteor breaks apart, but in this case, in a stationary position.  As an object in the atmosphere it would have been low enough that it was some distance away.  It never changed position.  My wife an I saw three of these several years ago and they had the same color which I can never quite decide if its reddish, orangish or pinkish.;36.0549020721397;-80.2589434765933
