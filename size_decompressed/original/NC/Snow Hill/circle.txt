Object flys west in North Carolina.;2014-11-10 21:30:00;15 minutes;Object flys west in North Carolina I went outside for my nightly walk down the street, headed towards the local county prison.  As I was walking, I saw bright light due North East.  I don’t know what it was about it, but it honestly did not look any differently than all of the other stars in the sky.  So I more or less ignored it, even though it seemed to be a bit brighter than the rest of the stars.  I’m not sure, but like a majority of stars, I just kind of picked it out of the rest. I continued my walk, but occasionally looked in the area of the light, and it was still there. This went on for around 5-10 minutes.  Again, I didn’t pay much attention to it.  I'd go along, look in the direction of the light, see that it was still there, (albeit it APPEARED to have moved a tiny bit but I’m chalking that up to a visual illusion) take a few more steps, so on and so forth.  Then, all of a sudden, it begins to move.  And quickly.  I watched it accelerate upwards, and then it flew west and disappeared. That is pretty much it.  Not much else to add to this particular experience;35.4445;-77.6998
