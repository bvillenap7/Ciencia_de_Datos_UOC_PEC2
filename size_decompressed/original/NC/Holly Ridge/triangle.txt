Green Lights Triangle Patter;2015-03-27 08:14:00;2 minutes;Green Lights Triangle Patter I am retired Army aviation of 8 years with two deployments to Iraq.  I have seen it all, day and night.  I understand FAA lighting patterns and those of all aircraft worldwide.   I was dropping my step daughter off at school.  The time was 0814 exactly, I was headed N on Dixon Rd. toward Rifle Range Rd.  The road is low speed of travel at 25 mph, a field for the school on the left high trees on the right.  At the intersection there is a tall tree line. I observed a triangular pattern of three green lights.  They would have been positioned directly downward from the aircraft they were attached to.  They were of a flood light type, this is inconsistent with any search light, landing light or position marker lights to include night vision friendly directional lights.  The aircraft appeared to be in a left bank descending turn low on the tree line as if in a final approach of a landing.  In the air force it would be considered a tactical landing due to the harsh maneuver required to perform such a maneuver.    Camp Lejeune is the property the aircraft was flying over.;34.4955000000005;-77.5546000000006
