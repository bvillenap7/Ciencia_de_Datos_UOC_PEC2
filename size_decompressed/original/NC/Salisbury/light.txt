He kept saying there is something in the sky.  Myself, my mom, my dad and my current brother in law (and former military) went out to look.  What we saw, none of us could explain.  We saw a light, it was barely moving, so at first we thought helicopter but there was no sound.  Then it started moving in the shape of a square. It was so fast and did this several times.  It suddenly stopped and took off.  We were stunned.  We had no explanation. Just as we turned away, it came back and did the same thing.  It formed what looked to be a square and then sat there in the sky and then took back off again.  I had never seen anything movie so fast and so quietly in my life.;35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973
Shining like a sparkler and brighter than the sun in broad daylight.;1997-06-30 12:00:00;10 seconds;Shining like a sparkler and brighter than the sun in broad daylight. Me and my cousin were coming back from eating at a restaurant in Salisbury N.C.  We were headed south on main and 29 by airport road in Salisbury.   The sun was coming from the right side of us in his car.  There was a even bigger light shining from our left and I thought it was odd.   Me and him looked to our left and saw what looked like a sparkler being burnt.  The object was as big as a house.  It than took off and was gone in less than a second.  It made no sound like a jet engine would make and did not make a sound.  I remember that it took off and was light years away in less than a second.   When me and my cousin looked at it, it was like they read our minds and knew to get out of there fast.   The whole encounter took less than ten seconds.  It was so bright that looking at it and getting a detailed description of the craft is not possible.  It looked like a sparkler.

It first appeared to be a plane then it made a sharp turn and started heading south.  It was moving in almost a zigzaging motion. Then a military plane flew overhead.  The UFO took another sharp turn and started to head west. The plane did not follow.  The object went behind trees and i lost sight of it.;35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973
