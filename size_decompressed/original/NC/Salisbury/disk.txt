The saucer hovered directly above and kept pace with my car  ((NUFORC Note:  No date indicated.  Possible hoax.  PD));2001-01-23 20:00:00;1 minute;The saucer hovered directly above and kept pace with my car Was traveling to an AA meeting just before 8 pm. I remember that from meeting times but do not remember month or date since this happened a few years ago. I was traveling down S. Main St. The first thing i noticed is that it was strangely deserted. I felt an intense erie presence and looked around but didnt see anybody or cars. I looked up to see a saucer directly above me.  That was at the point that i had stopped the car cause i sensed that the presence went at the speed and where my car went. i was feeling this thats why i looked up.  As soon as i looked up at the thing it took off at a slight angle and then straight up in a flash. i could see it getting smaller and then dissapear.  It made no sound. i have never before or after experienced anything like this but it was as clear to me as anything because ive been sober over 20 years.  The object was a metalic blue and silver.  It had a strange glow or haze in the sense that the colors almost faded or interchanged with each other and did not stay solid if that makes any sense. Like a fluxuation.  The year was between 2001 and 2002. In winter i believe. This is the only thing i am uncertain about.  I always said i should report it but never got around to it and just recently thought to do so when the debate came up again. I guess once youve seen one you get a little annoyed when people discount it and thats why im reporting it. nothing to gain but a little off my chest.I know what i saw.  Thank you for letting me share this with you and i do hope more evidence comes about and classified information is released. once again thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Date is unknown.  Please see similar report from same witness for date of January 17, 2001.  We have amended the date above, so that it corresponds to the follow-up report from the same witness.

I felt a strange presence around me as I was driving  and looked up to see a saucer directly above my car.;2001-01-23 20:00:00;approx. 1 min.;I felt a strange presence around me as I was driving  and looked up to see a saucer directly above my car. To whom it may concern,                                                               I have previously made this rep[ort some months ago. It was rejected because I could not give an exact date or even the year. I knew that it was in the winter and I knew the time because of a meeting I was going to that meets at 8pm. regularly. However I was unsure of an axact month or even the year.  I knew it was between 2001 and 2002 and it was in either January or February.  Upon speaking with a friend about UFO's and about my experience,I have re-thought the date of my siting.  I believe that it was in January of 2001, to the best of my recollection.  Anyway, that is my best guess.  That is all this reporting site has asked me for, so if this report is not accepted then I will not try again. I was surprised when the report was rejected because I could not give an exact date, especially when I seen a report from a man who claimed to see UFO's in the 1970's  with no specific dates of the sitings. I found the reply to be insulting, particularly when this site is supposed to be looking for reports from people.  I am not looking for any special recognition or for anything for that matter, accept to be believed, however, if I am not, than so be it.  With all this said I will report what I seen one last time.  I was traveling down Main Street in Salisbury, heading to an AA meeting, of which I had been a sober member for many years at the time and still am.  It was just before 8pm and I was just going to make it on time because I was running late.  I noticed that the street became suddenly and very strangely deserted, even for a street Salisbury, which is not a large city.   I felt a very errie presence that I find hard to describe. I did not know where it was coming from. Somehow I felt that this presence was around my car and felt that I could not shake it even though I was driving and was in motion.  I looked around in all directions but saw nothing.  I knew there was a definate presence though.   Finally I looked up to see, directly above me, a saucer. I stopped the car immediately and it stopped as well.  It then took off in a slight foward motion from my car and angled upward where it dissapeared into the sky at lightening speed.  I remember seeing it become smaller and smaller until it dissapeared into the sky.  It was a metallic blue/silver color and had an aura about it.  The lighting about it appeared to fluctuate, although there were no actual lights on it or that were coming from it.I could not tell how large or small it was or how close or far above me it was, only that it was above me.  My guess is that it was closer rather than further away and that it was not particularly large.  Well, that is my siting report and that is what I had seen.I have never before or since seen anything like that. Thank you for your time.

Very Strange UFO Sighting!!!!;2007-06-23 02:30:00;5 to 10 sec;Very Strange UFO Sighting!!!! It all took place so quick,But very strange On June 23,I was at home cleaning my kitchen.I was the only one home at the time, and I have four big windows in my kitchen When something caught my eye.As I looked out the window I noticed an object in the shape of disk appear from no where it was half visable and the other half invisable,I could tell it was rotating in a clock wise motion from the part that was visiable to the eye.It was flying lower than anything I have ever seen.And this was my second ufo encounter.Now after seeing that I wonder if these strange objects are around us more than we know.I would also like to add that it was silver color with a glow of blue like a halo around the part that was visiable.And after just a few seconds it vanished as fast as it appread.It was so strange to this day I`m always wondering if someone or something is watching me.I have not told this to anyone,because they would not believe me anyway.But I have read other ufo sightings by lots of people so I know that they saw something just like I did.  If anyone eles has seen something like that I would like to know about it! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973
