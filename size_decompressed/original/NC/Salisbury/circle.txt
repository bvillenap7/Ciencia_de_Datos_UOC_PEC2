Orange moving lights in the sky.;2008-07-31 21:20:00;5-10secthen10-15;Orange moving lights in the sky. So i was driving down the road to go meet some friends.  I noticed a star in the sky.  I though to myself that is a bright orange star.  Then the object got brighter and stated movin directly straight in my direction.  In all honesty it was hualin ass. Then this object came to a complete stand still and started pusling between a very bright orange and a white/orange.  There is no way that a plane pulses like that and can move this way. I almost came to a stop in the car and another one appeared in the same way. But, this one did not seem to race across the sky. It moved to the right away from the other light and then came to an immediate stop.  These two had the same colors.  I am not a scientist but it seemed as if they were communicating with pulsing of lights.  I kept driving and made it to my friends house. Two hours later I am driving back home and saw an orange light in the sky move so fast that the orange light streaked behing it.  Then the light came to a stand still very rapidly.  No more the five seconds later two more lights appeared and they were stationary.  They did not move from appearance to dissapearence. and started flashing between colors again.   All of the lights were lit up for no more than 15 seconds.  When they dissapeared they just faded back to looking like a star and then the lights faded as if there was nothing even there.  I caled the local authorities to see if any one else had seen this strange sight.  The lady I spoke with said that there were no other reports of these objects.  I know what I saw and I want to find out why these THINGS are here or what they are doing.;35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973
10 to 15 red string of lights, then started moving and eventually moved individually and dissappeared behind a cloud.;2012-06-02 22:00:00;10 minutes;10 to 15 red string of lights, then started moving and eventually moved individually and dissappeared behind a cloud. My son, his friend and I were coming home after an Intemidators minor league baseball game around 10 pm on saturday June 2nd.  I saw what I thought was a new tower with several lights.  However, the tower seemed to have lights to spread at the top on both sides which made me curious.   I told the boys to look at it and they were amazed.  It appeared that the lights began to move. They were a red color and circular in shape.  They seemed to start spreading out in different directions and it was very weird.  We arrived home and I went in to get my husband to come see.  There was only 1 or 2 left in the sky at that time, but he did see one.  My son and his friend said the others had moved to one spot in the sky behind a cloud and dissappeared.   As we watched the last one move toward the same area as the others, it seemed to flicker. It then reached the same area and dissappeared in as cloud and did not come out on the other side.  We of course wondered about airplanes but there would not be that many planes that close together or moving in different directions.   We also thought maybe helocopters, but did not think again that there would be that many that close together.   There was also no sound at all.   If anyone has any explanation, I would like to know it. Also, if anyone knows of any weather balloons or chinese lanterns in the area, I would like to know.  I've never really thought of ufo's and think there must be a logical explanation, but so far I have none.  I tried to report to the local television station but they did not seem interested.  I also called the police station.  They were nice and polite but were equally inthused.  Please continue your investigation in my area. It is Salisbury, close to China Grove, NC. Thank You for your time.;35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973
Small, Circular UFO spotted and moves once camera flashes.;2013-11-12 21:00:00;10 minutes;Small, Circular UFO spotted and moves once camera flashes Went outside and saw a circular ball of bright yellow/orange light. It stayed in the same place for about 8 minutes and after grabbing the camera and flashing it twice, the UFO moved South, towards Charlotte, at a very high speed.  Even though you could see in the distance, the light just disappeared almost immediately after it started moving.  Same sighting has been spotted countless times in Lake Waccamaw, NC.;35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973
During the night, I came across 4-5 disks of light, circling each other in flight.;2015-10-26 19:00:00;2 hours;During the night, I came across 4-5 disks of light circling, each other in flight. While walking to my girlfriends house I saw disks of light circling each other since it was near Halloween I thought they were just decorations but they seemed to follow me.  They kept ahead of me and every so often they would disappear.  Eventually I noticed that they were doing a pattern (they circled each other and then came together to for one spinning disk with thick edges).  I know they weren't just flood lights or something related because they kept following me for about half a mile and always kept about the same distance in front of me.  Eventually I was offered a ride and made it to my girlfriend's house and after that I kind of forgot about them.;35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973
