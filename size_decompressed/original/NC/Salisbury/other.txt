The object appeared to be blinking to the naked eye. We used a pair of binoculars to get a closer look and found the object was not blinking but changing colors. The colors were bluish, greenish and an amber color. It was bright enough not to be able to make out the shape. It stayed in the first location approximately 10 minutes and then disappeared as if it's lights went out. After about 2 minutes, it re-appeared in a location about 1/4 mile to the southwest of it's first location. It stayed stationary for about 5 minutes. All of a sudden it streaked off so fast to the south and in less than a second it was gone. The object was about 5 times the size of a plane. There were numerous commercial aircraft flying high above. This is how we determined the size.;35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973
