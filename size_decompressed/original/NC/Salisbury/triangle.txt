Aircraft flying low and fast with lights out of sync.;2016-06-30 22:45:00;15+ minutes;Aircraft flying low and fast with lights out of sync. I was just outside with a friend and we watched what was either several aircraft pass one at a time or just one flying the same area over and over - the lights were out of sync (two solid, one red blinking, and another blinking at a different, faster interval).  It/they were flying above cloud level, but big enough to see all the separate lights, and moving very quickly.  We kept seeing the same thing over and over coming from north and east, all headed south-west.  I'm quite familiar with the typical flight paths of the local planes, as I see them every day, and this was not normal. I entered a duration of 15 minutes, but that's only as long as I was outside.  I saw the first one as soon as I stepped out, and they were still going when I went inside.;35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973
