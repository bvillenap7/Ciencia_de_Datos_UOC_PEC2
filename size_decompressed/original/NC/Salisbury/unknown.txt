Exact direction was unknown and it was at about a 45 degree angle in the sky.  At first we thought it was a plane, but there was no noise coming from the object. We knew there would have to be as this object couldn’t have been more than 100-200 yards up.  As we were discussing what it could be, a blue neon looking trail emitted from the object.  At ground level this blue beam looked about 5-6 inches long, but had to have been close to 50 feet.   When this blue beam emitted from it (at this point the light was in plain sight, near no tree line) it vanished and could not be located again.  When we returned we saw low flying helicopters in the area.  We don’t know if they were in any relation to what we saw.;35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973

Our Ring doorbell captured event as person detected.  When I watched back the film I didn’t see anyone however there was 2 blinking lights 10 feet from the ground facing the house with movement and then it appeared to go behind a pine tree we have at the corner of the house.  The lights were very bright and could still be seen.  Video clip was 30 seconds.;35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973
