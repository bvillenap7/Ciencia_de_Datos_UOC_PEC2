My husband and I have been noticing these objects for 2 years. Just the other nigh 10/22/12... I finally was able to get a few up close photos. I t has never been within distance for my camera to pick up. I cannot get the camcorder to pick it up, buy as I said, we finally got some shots. It's usually between 10-1am we spot them.  We have seen as many as 3 at a time. What caught our eyes to eyes to begin with,  it's extremely bright so you can't miss it.  You then will notice either a green air blue light along with red & orange only when it's bobbling then goeIs to the left then to the right then it will make a cone type shape with a bright white light then shoot strait up.It ill repeat the process .
