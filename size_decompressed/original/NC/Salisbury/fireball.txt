It went up towards the NW around a tree in the yard suddenly changed directions and headed S. That is when I ran around the tree and out into the road to see where it went, Mom yelled out that it was coming at her and I went back over to where she sat (on the steps) it reappeared only once more a brief second later when it just seemed to be on the other side of the tree but still somehow in the clouds.It looked like a glowing sphere then, where at first it looked more like a meteor. The weather conditions were as follows warm,humid,hazy low cloud cover almost foggy.Yet there were several stars visible( I remember the three stars in the big dipper and Actarus being visible) I have been an amateur astronomer for 20+ years and you can rule out any kind of meteor or bolide. But I still got a wierd feeling like it was real close at first, and not up in the air. It appeared white/yellow;35.6670110921502;-80.5252003412973
