Cigar shaped object seen in Willard NC sky.;2011-10-23 15:00:00;2 minutes;Cigar shaped object seen in Willard NC sky. My wife and I were standing in our yard in Willard, NC. We saw a silver black banded cigar shaped object The sky was clear no clouds.  It was traveling in a north to south direction. I did not make note of the date because I had no intention of reporting it at the time. I had time to run inside and get my camera, but I just stood there dumbfounded and stared at it until it past the tree line and it could no longer be seen. We were talking as we watched and we agreed it looked like a missle or torpedo it was silver with a black door on the side of it, but it was horizontal and not going very fast. What we thought was a black door I guess could have been a black band that wrapped around it. It was like a low flying passenger jet maybe a 747 or something. (a big one) Shiny silver with no wings only the black in the center. It was in the afternoon when we saw it maybe 3 oclock or so. It was a Sunday and I would have to guess it was 10/23/2011.  Wish I had took a p! icture and noted the date. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.6845;-78.0234
