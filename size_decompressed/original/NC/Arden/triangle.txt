I was using my 8‚Äù dobsonian telescope with a 25mm. lens to view the surface of the moon, I was using what is called moon filter to  cut down glare or light reflecting off the moon surface, concentrating on the mere area of the moon I saw a UFO. The shape was a Black Triangle that took about 4 seconds to go from left side of the moon to the right. This was not any type of air craft that I know of. Because of the tracking system on my telescope and also the computer software I use for tracking stars and the constellations. Again, I have no idea what this was I am just reporting what I saw. A black triangle that was outside our atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.4642999999999;-82.5336000000002
