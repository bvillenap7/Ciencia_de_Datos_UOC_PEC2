Glowing orange inverted teardrop silently flying low overhead;2020-06-29 21:50:00;1 minute;Glowing orange inverted teardrop silently flying low overhead I was taking my dog out and looked up to see an orange light approaching from the north. Moving slowly and silently, it passed over me at a relatively low altitude.  As it got closer I was able to make out an inverted teardrop shape with a glowing orange core that looked like fire.  After passing overhead it briefly paused and hovered for 5-10 seconds before progressing further south.   I watched as it made its way out of sight with my roommate whom I called to come witness the event.  In all I could see it for about a minute.;35.4642999999999;-82.5336000000002
