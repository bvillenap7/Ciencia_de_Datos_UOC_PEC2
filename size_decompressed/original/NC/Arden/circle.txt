A bright object appeared suddenly, moved south, disappeared and was chased by jets.;2004-10-31 22:00:00;5-10 seconds;A bright object appeared suddenly, moved south, disappeared and was chased by jets. My son and I were looking at the stars and then a light just came on in the middle of the sky it looked brighter than the north star and it moved south, it was very high up because it only moved a few inches i.e. I held out my arm and closed one eye and it moved maybe 4 finger tip lengths. Then it just diappeared there was no tail so I thought it was not a meteor or comet, then a few minutes later two jets came towards the same spot the ufo was in 1 flew south the other went west then headed south, 10- 15 minutes later two more jets arrived and headed south at high speeds.;35.4642999999999;-82.5336000000002
Burning sphere moving through the sky at dusk.;2010-10-29 19:10:00;4 minutes;Burning sphere moving through the sky at dusk. Observed one object moving due north over home at a fairly low rate of speed.  Was able to watch it for 4 minutes until it passed into the horizon.  Unable to determine altitude.  Oject appeared to be on fire however there was no residual trail or change to the intesity of the light.   The object was dark red in the center with a lighter red, orange, and yellow hues near the permiter.  The object moved in a direct path without change to speed or direction.   The winds were strong out of the north that evening so there is no way the wind was influencing the northly direction of this object, which to me would have ruled out a weather balloon.   I witnessed a very similar object 25 years ago when living outside of Frankfurt Germany, however this one seemed to be lower in altitude.;35.4642999999999;-82.5336000000002
