Fireball seen after 10 shooting stars;2005-11-03 05:15:00;-10 secs;Fireball seen after 10 shooting stars What i saw:  At same moment my attention was caught by many shooting stars all moving in burst of maybe 10 or so in top of sky from East to West near Mars.   Appearing in a group like shooting stars in their nature.   A few secs later i saw a bright glowing ball appear in the sky in this same area, an object i would call a fireball and move with less speed also East to West and vanish behind a cloud and for a moment causing lighting of the cloud. It did not see it come out of the other side.  More so i had my camera with me and i GOT THE THING in 3 PICS! I saw no signs of intelligent flight, but i can say it seemed to slow down as it moved and was VERY bright and color shifted from yellow to red. Obviously if i had time to raise my camera and snap 3 photos it was not moving nearly as fast as what a shooting star's nature would be.  I was able to keep sight of the object for about 8 secs on its pass over.  On the largest photo you can see Mars and get an idea of the level of zoom was minimal  (did not have time to zoom)  Object was moving about 5 times as fast as a jet would cross the sky and was EXTREMELY bright when you compare it to Mars and realize how bright Mars was in the nighttime sky to your eye. I had my camera against a tree and the streaking does not appear in Mars only in this object.  Light it was giving off seemed to flicker and was very unusual in appearance besides the color change.;35.4642999999999;-82.5336000000002
