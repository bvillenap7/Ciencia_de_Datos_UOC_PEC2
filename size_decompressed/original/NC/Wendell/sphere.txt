Observed unexplained object(s) in the sky near Raleigh, NC;2009-03-08 19:00:00;20 min;Observed unexplained object(s) in the sky near Raleigh, NC What began as an my observing an unbelievably bright Venus soon gave way to my thinking that the object was possibly a jetliner w/ landing lights traveling toward my location.  I was driving at the time and could not discern movement until after observing for about ten minutes.  My route was on winding country roads, so as I constantly changed direction, the light stayed consistent.  I began to suspect this wasn't a jetliner. Oddly, as I drove I saw two jetliners on approach to RDU to the west of my location (about 30 miles away), and could see their flashing beacon lights.  The object I was observing did not have flashing beacon lights.  The object I had been observing seemed to be about the same altitude but farther west of the jetliners on approach, and the object shown much brighter than the jetliners.  I lost sight of the object as my view was blocked by trees.  When the tree line ended to my surprise I saw three idenical objects in a razor sharp straight line appearing to head north beyond the RDU approach the jetliners had taken.  Military?

Went back inside to tell my parents to look at it, came back out and it was gone, came back out and it was back.  Stayed again for another 3-4 min.  And was gone again.  Then came back with a horizontal light beam like a spot light that was a long beam of light.;35.7980000000002;-78.3925999999995
