I get up very early to go to work. Just a few days ago as I was leaving my trailer, I noticed a strange light coming from the field across the road. I thought it was a big truck, or something but I soon realized it was not. It was a strange object that just glowed and moved around the edge of the woods. Now I have never seen anything like this before, and I had always hoped that I would, but dang if I didn't nearly go in my pants when that thing started moving toward my trailer. It hovered over head for about 3 minutes, changing colors every few seconds. I can tell you it made no sound, but I could feel the heat coming off that thing. I just stood there, scared to death! Suddenly there was no light, and it looked to be metallic and about 35 feet across. I am not sure what color, because It was so bright before my eyes could not adjust. It shot straight up in the sky and disappeared. I nearly passed out. I could not even go into work that day. All I could do was sit on the couch and shotgun budweisers till I passed out. I still get scared when I think of what happened. I am really scared it might come back. I have had the runs ever since I saw it. Do you suppose I was abducted? I need some help! I had to tell somebody, but I have been too scared. I have not been sleeping, or eating, or living since that morning. I am sure with time, I will adjust. Thanks for listening.
