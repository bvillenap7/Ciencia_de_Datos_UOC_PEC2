Two wobbling lights appeared in the sky and wobbled for twenty minutes.  They had rising and falling erraticly, and sometimes circular flight patterns, and moved faster that the other aircraft in the night sky. They moved erratically for several minutes.  Eventually one came towards our home and flew behind it out of our sight.   We observed the other light for several more minutes before the light seemingly disappeared as if someone turned off a light switch.  Both lights were very high in the sky.;35.487489878542;-81.175594331983
