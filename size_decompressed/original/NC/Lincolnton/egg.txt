I NOTICED A SATELLITE MOVING INTO THIS AREA THEN THERE APPEARED 2 FOOTBALL SHAPED OBJECTS EACH WITH MULTIPLE ORANGE LIGHTS (APPR. 5 OR 6) TRAVELING NORTH-NORTHWEST FASTER THEN THE SATELLITE BUT SLOWER THAN THE METEORS. THEY LASTED ABOUT 20-30 SECONDS. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE LARGE PLANE, BUT THEN THE ONE ON THE LEFT MOVED DIRECTLY BEHIND THE OTHER. THEN I THOUGHT IT WAS PROBABLY TWO FIGHTER JETS. THEN THE ONE BEHIND BEGAN MOVING EXTREMELY FAST AND ERRATIC SIDE TO SIDE FORWARD AND BACKWARDS. MOVEMENTS THAT A FIGHTER JET COULD NOT DO TO MY KNOWLEGED. MY DAD WAS A COL. IN THE AIR-FORCE AND I'M 48 YEARS OLD AND HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. WHAT COULD IT BE?;35.487489878542;-81.175594331983
