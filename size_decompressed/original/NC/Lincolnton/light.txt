Bright light in western sky that did not look normal.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));2009-01-08 20:10:00;45 minutes;Bright light in western sky that did not look normal. Around 20:10 hours I went outside my home to walk my dog.  I had been walking my dog about five minutes when I looked up and saw a very bright light in the western sky.  As I continued walking my dog I noticed that the light had gained in altitude but did not seem to be moving forward it only appeared to be moving vertically.  I continued walking my dog and watching the light.  The area of the light is in the flight path for airplanes entering and exiting Charlotte-Douglas Airport in Charlotte. At first I thought it may be an airplane, but I watch airplanes every night and this light was different.  It was much brighter than any airplane I have ever seen and it remained stationary except for the time that it gained in altitude.  As I started walking back to my home with my dog the light very rapidly lost altitude and began to travel horizontally toward the north until I finally lost sight of it. The entire sighting lasted from 20:10 hours until 20:45 hours.  There were many airplanes in the sky that night and the difference between the two was very obvious.  There were no other lights (red, blue, etc.) visible that I could discern with my eyes, only a very bright white light.  The light did not appear to be pulsating or rotating. That is all that I know about this event.   End of statement. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));35.487489878542;-81.175594331983
