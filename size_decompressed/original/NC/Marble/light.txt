The object we witnessed was a bright green light that made no sound.  The location we were at only allowed us to see the object for about 5 seconds before is disappeared behind the trees.  We were in a low valley facing about northwest when the light came into view from the left. The light passed in and out of the clouds as it flew by, illuminating the clouds with a green glow.   We have a small airport in nearby Andrews, so I've seen plenty of small planes with there lights. The light we saw was much brighter and flew at a faster speed. I would estimate the light to fly at about 3,000 to 4,000 feet and was traveling steadily northeast at about 200 to 400 miles per hour.;35.1449;-83.9414
