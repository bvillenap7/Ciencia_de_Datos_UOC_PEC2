Aircraft with pressure wave ahead of it?;2005-04-17 16:00:00;5 Minutes;Aircraft with pressure wave ahead of it? Hello, my Jeep club was out cleaning a trail when several of us noticed an unusual vapor contrail in the sky.  The craft was too high to be seen clearly, but what caught our attention was that the craft was creating a contrail behind, as well as ahead of it.  The only thing I can think of, was that it had a pressure wave well ahead of the craft.   At first we thought that it might have been two aircraft, one following the other at a distance, but none of us were able to see another craft.   It appeared as if the craft had a leading pressure wave that was disturbing the atmosphere ahead of it.   I was just curious if anyone has ever reported anything like this.  Maybe it was a new type of military craft? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD));35.9824999999992;-78.5376000000014
