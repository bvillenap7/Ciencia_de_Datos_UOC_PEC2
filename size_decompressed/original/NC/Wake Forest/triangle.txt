I had just dropped off our future son in law at a local training campus and was heading back home, southbound on Hwy 1 (also known as Capital Blvd), passing through Wake Forest and talking with my mother on the phone via bluetooth.  The phone call was initiated at 13:42 and a few minutes later a fast moving aircraft caught my eye, moving from east to west, then making a quick vertical turn up with the aircraft turning so a triangular shape could be seen briefly as it looped up, then making a downward turn to only see the side of the aircraft (triangular shape undetectable--looked like a thin rectangle at this point), for a split second before a flash of opalescent crystal-like shapes appeared and then it disappeared. I live by a military base and am used to seeing fighter jets fly over on maneuvers when the air base was still separate from the army base (they are now together) so aircraft have always fascinated me.  At first I wondered why one would be up in this part of the state when I first saw the aircraft.  When it turned and disappeared, I knew it couldn't have been one of ours.  I relayed what I saw to my mother after it happened.  She mentioned Coast to Coast and how there have been more UFOs sighted lately.  I just didn't think I would ever see one, let alone during the day.;35.9824999999992;-78.5376000000014
