A UFO making strange movements and odd blinking lights;2008-09-07 19:00:00;3 minutes;A UFO making strange movements and odd blinking lights While I was standing outside for a few minutes, I saw what I thought at first was an airplane.  After a moment I noticed it was kind of a diamond shape and a lot of steady and randomly blinking lights. The way the UFO was moving was a little strange.  I saw it going straight in a path then occassionally it would move in a side by side motion.  It then continued forward.  Strangely enough after about a minute it had slowed down then reversed for a few seconds, then continuing straight/forward at a steady pace until it was no longer visible.  Seeming to appear to go upward rather than forward/straight. I'm not really sure what it was but I know that is not the motion and movements of an air craft. And was somewhat diamand with more of a rounded figure in shape.;35.9824999999992;-78.5376000000014
