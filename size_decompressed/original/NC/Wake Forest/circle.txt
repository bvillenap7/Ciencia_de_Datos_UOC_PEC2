Outside with dog. Very clear sky, many stars out.  Noticed what I first thought was a plane at high altitude but it had no flashing lights and made no sound.  Just a single white star-like object moving at moderate speed.  It did not fly in a straight line but rather a strange S type motion.  I tracked it across the sky where it soon  dimmed out and disappeared completely.   Stayed outside another 5 minutes or so and saw nothing further. I am familiar with airplanes, meteors, comets, etc. It was not any of these.;35.9824999999992;-78.5376000000014

They remained in a straight line as if they were connected.  They flew from north east to South west.   The lights flickered and then faded away.  Shortly after they faded, another light from the north, flew across the sky.  It soon faded away.;35.9824999999992;-78.5376000000014
