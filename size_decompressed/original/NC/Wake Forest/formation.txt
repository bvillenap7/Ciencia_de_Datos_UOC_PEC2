Line of 8 big lights.;2014-01-19 23:00:00;2 minutes;Line of 8 big lights. I was driving my car down Capital Blvd going North, right near the Wal-Mart in Wake Forest. I was on the phone with my sister when i saw these lights, like almost making a V like geese do sometimes when in flight, so i slowed down my car and started at them further...and they were very high up in the sky, along the stars. it is a very clear night tonight (this just happened to me, i'm kinda freaked out).  At first there were 6 lights and they were in a line, moving, but not moving in a straight line. they looked like they were almost dancing around. the size of these lights was much bigger than the stars, much more visible. i pulled over on the side of the road, and 2 more lights came out of the end making it now 8 lights. just jumping around almost in this almost straight line shaped formation. one second i looked at my phone to see the time and i looked back up and they were completely gone...no where in sight. to be honest i got the fuck out of there because i was, and like i said still am very startled about it..;35.9824999999992;-78.5376000000014
