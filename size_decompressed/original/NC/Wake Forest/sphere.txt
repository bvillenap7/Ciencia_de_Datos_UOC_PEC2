Fast moving sphere moving very fast;2016-09-05 09:35:00;30 seconds;Fast moving sphere moving very fast The sphere or disc moved from North to South at a speed too fast for a ballon. It had a gold/bronze color. There was no sound or vapor trail emitted. The speed it moved was comparable to what I recall as a commercial jet however it did not have the shape or color of commercial jets.  A few minutes later a commercial jet passed over head with the normal sound being emitted. What I saw earlier was not a commercial aircraft.
