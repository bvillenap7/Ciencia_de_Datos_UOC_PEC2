3 Hovering objects in the sky.;2019-12-06 10:45:00;5 minutes;3 Hovering objects in the sky This is the fourth time Iâ€™ve seen this bright light (white in color) in the sky in the past couple of years. It is always in the same place every time I see it.  Out of the front of my house, 143 degrees south east.  It hovers in the air with very bright lights and it does not move. There are no noises or indicators that it is a helicopter or plane.  It is extremely still until all of the sudden the lights are gone, disappears in the dark without moving across the sky. Last time I saw it, it was about 2AM and there was a hum throughout our house and outside. I had never heard that noise before but it stayed for hours. This time, the hover craft was gone within 5 minutes of me seeing it. 2 crafts further away accompanied it.  They were different though as they were not just white lights but also flashed hints of red and blue. However, like the large and closer craft, they did not move in the sky. From my viewpoint the 3 crafts formed a triangle. The large close c! raft disappeared after five minutes while the 2 further crafts stayed in the sky.;35.9824999999992;-78.5376000000014
