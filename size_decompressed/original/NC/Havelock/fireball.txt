Bright, white, extremely large meteor-like object seen in night sky.;2008-10-16 20:00:00;>1 second;Bright, white, extremely large meteor-like object seen in night sky. A single white, almost blue-white fireball, if you will, was seen traveling through a clear night western sky for less than a second.  It appeared small, and grew larger and brighter before abruptly dissapearing with a few small sparks doing the same off to the side.  It covered about 10 feet of sky in such a small amount of time that it was basically a flash.  It was traveling horizontally with a slightly downward angle. I and the other witness, sitting in a car, first thought that it might be a flare or other firework, but we agreed that it moved too fast for that.  Also, it appeared high in the sky and moved horizontally, so it more than likely didn't come from the ground.  It very closely resembled a meteor, except that it was much larger and brighter.  If this object WAS a meteor, it would have had to have been much larger than a house when it hit the atmosphere. As previously stated, both witnesses were sitting in a moving car.  I was looking through an open side window, and the person in the passenger seat saw the object through the windshield.  Also, there were no other objects in the sky except the stars.;34.8965;-76.8869
