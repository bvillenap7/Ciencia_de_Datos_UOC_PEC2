copies of 8mm footgae and computer discs of phjotos on their way to you.;2003-12-05 05:30:00;15 minutes;copies of 8mm footgae and computer discs of phjotos on their way to you. This object has been appearing off an on to this date since dec 5 2003. I have much footage and also computer discs with photos on it I am sending to you. I have sent copies of two tapes to George Fawcett (back in last of Dec 2003) after contacting and being referred by Peggy, Asst Director of MUFON in NC. After a couple of emails and a couple phone conversations with george I stil have no clue as to what this is. It is almost like MUM is the word now. I get no answers when I email george or write snail mail all I get from him is brouchures about his books and UFO meeting about 300 miles away.. He turned the footage over to an unknown photographer for analysis. Last phone converstaion still no word from photographer after three months. But I did recieve an email for Georeg to begin with that said  can you think of any reason they would show themselves to you, is there anything there or just military presence During our phone converstaion he stated UFOs have plasma drive and that is the  glowing around the object you have filmed. Also, stated they may be trying to communicate with you. ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to look at the footage, and we will request that the other witnesses submit reports.  PD));34.8965;-76.8869
