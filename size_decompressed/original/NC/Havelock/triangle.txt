I looked to see what it was and I saw a triangular shaped object coming towards me.  I was going head on when we had to turn to go to the next road.  I tried to look underneath but it was hard to see.  I remember that I saw a round bottom.  It was a triangular shape.  The lights were massive and were very bright. It was hard to see because of the brightness. All that was between us was a little church. We turned around to get a second look.  It disappeared. For all I know it could have landed or took off super fast.  I called up my friend who was right in front of us. They said “Hello” I was like “hey, did you just see that?” “Yeah!” She said.  After that, she described the same exact thing as I did.  So, we went home. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));34.8965;-76.8869
