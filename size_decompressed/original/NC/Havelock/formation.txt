I looked up to the stars and off to the left I noticed dozens of lights moving rapidly in a straight line and disappearing at what seemed like the same fixed point in the sky. (I later told my wife I wonder if they were disappearing into an invisible or unseen mothership) I told my wife and we both watched for a minute or so as I attempted to tell my brother what we were seeing. A moment later my wife went inside to tell our older son. They came out to watch the last dozen or so lights disappear at the same spot in the sky. All of the lights seemed to be the same brightness traveling in almost a straight line but not perfectly. The closest thing I could relate it to would be if a stationary aircraft were to shoot tracers in the sky at something else in the sky and the tracers burnt out at the exact location without fading out but instantly extinguishing at the same point! in the sky and the tracers did not fall due to gravity in fact they seemed to follow a very straight path. I have been in Marine Corps aviation for 20 years and have flown in large formations but never in a straight line like that. I was a crew chief on CH-46's and MV-22's and performed air to ground and air to air gunnery and we would never shoot air to air in any possibly populated area.;34.8965;-76.8869
