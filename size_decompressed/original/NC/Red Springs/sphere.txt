Orange Spheres Dance in the Sky;2004-04-19 21:15:00;10 Minutes;Orange Spheres Dance in the Sky At approximately 9:15 on the 19th of April 2004 two of my friends and I walked outside and noticed two spheres hovering over a field across the street from our house.  They were orange in color and from our position were the size of the lights on a stoplight (though they were about a half a mile away).  The spheres were hovering close to each other and periodically and very quickly shifted positions in the sky.  After about two minutes of observation the objects shot rapidly into the distance heading north east.  We waited outside for about five minutes scanning the sky when the two objects reappeared hovering in the same area.  The repeated the same movements for about another two minutes and then shot off in the same direction again.;34.81;-79.1592
