The little ones disappear and then a very large one in comparison to the small shows up and just hangs there.  This must be way up because it is hard to determine the shape but it does appear there are 3 or 4 bright lights that make either a triangle pattern or a diamond pattern.  I would not have believed it with my own eyes except for I saw it with my own eyes.  Does Asheville, NC, have drones that are allowed to observe us? The more I look, the more I see.   About three months later I woke up in the middle of the night and a bright neon green light was in the grass of my neighbors across the street.  I live in the woods and this light was not the color of a lighting bug or a small animals eye - I watched - did not take my eyes off as it buried itself into the dirt.  I know what I saw and spent a half an hour combing every square inch of the grassy area the next day and didn't see any big bug that may have died or any hole from a mole if that is what someone is going to say to me.  I just want an explanation because this is happening and maybe there is an explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
