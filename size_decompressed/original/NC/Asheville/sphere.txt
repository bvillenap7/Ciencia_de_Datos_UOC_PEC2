Figure eight flying light over Asheville;1997-07-15 23:00:00;+/- 1minute;Figure eight flying light over Asheville As I was leaving work I was driving the stretch of highway between Oteen and Swannanoa headed home. I was the only car on the road for the time.  I noticed movement in the sky, so I slowed down to get a better look.  I saw what I first thought could have been an low flying airplane or a helicopter, then my view was obstructed by some trees hanging off a cliff where the road curves around.  As I rounded the curve I looked back at the object and noticed that it was moving in a figure eight pattern.  I slowed even more to get an even better look at it.  Then it took off in a streak of light at an angle but upwards into space.   The object was too far for me to make out any details, but it emitted a brilliant white light.  I would say that it was spherical or circular in shape from the shape of the light I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

What was thought to be glare from the Sun turns out to be Strange Orb on Indian Land.;2016-07-29 12:00:00;Not sure;What was thought to be glare from the Sun turns out to be Strange Orb on Indian Land. I do not recall seeing the sphere until the last picture I took when I stopped at the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitors Center.  I took a picture of the sun along with the surroundings my entire trip back to Charlotte, however there at the visitors' center, that last picture I noticed what I thought was a glare on the screen of my cell phone as I snapped the picture suddenly there was a bright light, at the time I thought nothing of it thinking it was the sun, but later on I looked at the picture and I noticed the sphere had a glow around it zoomed in and realized what it was.  It is in every picture I took of the sun that day, but the only one with a glow around it.  The pictures with the clouds really gives you a clear view of it looks like.   I will include only the picture with the glare around it until I can confirm this is a legit form I am filling out.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Orange-Red Sphere/Ball of Light.  ((anonymous source));2019-05-24 22:00:00;3 minutes;Orange-Red Sphere/Ball of Light. Very large orange-red ball of light/sphere traveling at moderate speed, E - W in sky. Object was much larger than a star, left no trails, seemed to sparkle, but did not flash.   After object disappeared above tree cover, it never emerged from the other side.  Iâ€™ve seen enough satellites & planes at night to know this object was not one of these.  I figure it was something burning up entering the atmosphere from space, but wanted to report it just in case.
