Five orange silent hot air balloon shapes ascending the night sky.;2012-06-06 23:00:00;5-7 minutes;Five orange silent hot air balloon shapes ascending the night sky. I'm a retired registered nurse.  It was approximately 11:00PM EST on 06/6/12 and I decided to open the door to my east balcony and take in the night air.   I looked directly east toward the mountain and approximately 1/2 mile away I saw what looked like a hot air balloon lit up with a orange glow floating silently up and away to the north through the clouds.   As it ascended a second one appeared where the first one had started and it went up and away following the first ones trajectory.   I ran and got my binoculars and it looked like the orange glow was much brighter in the bottom half of the hot air balloon shapes but I couldn't see any detail even with the binoculars.   They were moving silently and quickly, disappearing through the clouds.  The night was cool-63 degrees, no breeze, partly cloudy with some stars visible. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect that she is a very good witness.  PD));35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
