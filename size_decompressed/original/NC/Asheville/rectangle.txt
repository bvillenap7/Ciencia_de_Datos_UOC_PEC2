Strange double UFO sighting near UNCA, North Asheville, NC;2018-06-03 10:40:00;5 minutes;Strange double UFO sighting near UNCA, North Asheville, NC Was walking up the stairs to my apartment in North Asheville across from UNCA.  Saw a small bright white light (like a bright star).  Moved slowly from left of sky to right.  Light was slowly and closely passed alongside by a small rectangular craft, looking almost like a small shuttle pod or craft of some sort (*note* no visible wings on craft, it was small possibly the size of a large minivan).  The craft showed l faintly blinking red and green lights.   Shortly after the UFOâ€™s passed each other the white light craft stoped and stayed stationary (it is still there to my knowledge). The other craft had vanished.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
