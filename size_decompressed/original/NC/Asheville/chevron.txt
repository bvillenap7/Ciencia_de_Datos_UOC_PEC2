Boomerang shaped object, glowing pink, red and yellow flying south.;2007-09-16 22:00:00;12 seconds;Boomerang shaped object, glowing pink, red and yellow flying south. I was laying in my backyard, looking up at the stars. It was a very clear night with no clouds to be seen and little or no moonlight. I saw a boomerang shaped object that was glowing pink and yellow and red slowly moving across the sky, straight North to South. It appeared quite close.... as in the height you'd see major aircraft making its descent towards the airport.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Extremely Large, Slow Moving,  V-Shaped Cloud-like  Formation in Night Sky.;2009-07-11 00:00:00;30 minutes;Extremely Large, Slow Moving, V-Shaped Cloud-like Formation in Night Sky. As I recall, late on the night of the 11th of July 2009 (possibly 10th or 12th), I saw an incredibly large (several football field lengths) V-shaped cloud structure that was very slow moving in the night sky.  It was not close, not too far either-15,000/ 20,000 feet??  It was dead silent.  I could not see any craft just this very precise cloud structure slowly creeping across the sky- therefore assumed it was a meteorological phenomenon.  The shape just seemed too geometric to be natural. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Moved around at frist in the sky slowly. Then got closer to the ground.Look like two or three different color lights on it. Saw one big;2015-04-27 21:45:00;>1 hour;Moved around at frist in the sky slowly.  Then got closer to the ground.  Look like two or three different color lights on it.  Saw one big passenger jet land while it was still in the sky.  The jet made a real low landing like to stay clear of the object.  Then no air traffic for at least a hour.  Then once it was gone tons of air traffic. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It was 9:45pm at night. Southwest was the direction ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above.

Strange boomerang shaped craft sighted outside of downtown Asheville.;2017-11-16 22:00:00;<1 minute;Strange boomerang shaped craft sighted outside of downtown Asheville. Just outside of downtown Asheville I saw an unidentified craft in the night sky.  I was outside of my apartment smoking a cigarette and looking at the stars, when I saw a rounded wing like shape (like a boomerang) enter the periphery of my view and fly across my field of sight. The object was moving extraordinarily fast and the entire sighting lasted a couple seconds.  The craft had no visible lights and I only glimpsed it because it must have been flying at a low altitude (speculation).  This object made no noise whatsoever. Signed,  ((name deleted)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) ((To NUFORC Webmaster)), my name is ((name deleted)).  I submitted a UFO sighting report on the nuforc.org website and accidentally had the zip code auto populated with an old address. the correct zip is 28804.  After I sent in the report I clicked onto the home page and saw this account: Madison, Wisconsin, Tuesday, November 07, 2017, @ 7:35 p.m. (Central)- An adult male, who describes himself as former military, witnessed a dark-colored triangle-, or boomerang-shaped, object fly rapidly overhead in the night sky, exhibiting no navigation lights.  Immediately after the object had passed overhead, a smaller object streaked overhead, apparently in pursuit of the triangular craft.  The whole incident occurred in an estimated 5 seconds. This report is nearly identical to what I witnessed.  Have there been many of these types of sightings? thanks. all the best to you, ((END ADDENDUM));35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
