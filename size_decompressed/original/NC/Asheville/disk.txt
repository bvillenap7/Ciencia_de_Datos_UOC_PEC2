Experienced by my co-worker, Steve. It happened, he went for a drive with his wife and 7 yr. old daughter. They drove near a car-wash on , I guess a back street.. Steve said he saw thiss thing floating about 50 feet up in the air. He stopped his car beneath this thing.Steve got out under this thing. He describes it as follows. It was a very very dark nite. As I drove by the car wash, I could see this thing, about 50 feet in the air. It was making no noise. at first, I only law a circle about 25 feet in diameter. at approximately a 90 degree angle from the bottom of the circle, I could windows, with and orange amber glow coming from them.The windows connected to the bottom of this huge thing, that was as big as a football field..I listened for a sound and heard nothing, but was completely AWE STRUCK . I saw, what looked like scorch marks on the bottom where the windows connected to the bottom to this huge ship.. My wife screamed out to me, Steve, get back in the car.I came back to my senses. Unbelievablelythis object, moved slowly at first, , then ziiiiiiippppp, it moved about 2 miles in a couple of seconds. It stopped right above a small mountain and zipped, very fast over them, about 5 miles away towards some other mountains, paused and moved out of site. My friend Steve, a co-worked told me this. He and his wife is now divorvced and he has remarried. His new wife did'nt believe him. He went thru a nasty divorce, but to this day, his ex backs him up with this story. Steve can really tell u the details better than I can.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Seen craft very close hovering over telephone poll not moving or making a sound.;1994-03-15 21:00:00;30 min;Seen craft very close hovering over telephone poll not moving or making a sound. I was with my mom, dad, and brother we were on our way to the store when we noticed about 5 or 6 cars stopped and people standing around looking up.  We looked up and seen a UFO that was hovering about 50 to 100 or so feet over a telephone pole.  It was very close and I could see it perfectly.  It was shaped like two bowls with the rims touching together.  It had lights that went all around the center of it.  There was what seemed to be a door that was opened on the side of it.  I kept looking in trying to see if I could see something.  The craft just sat there not moving or making a sound.  Everyone was just standing there amazed at what they were seeing.  We stood there for a while just looking at this thing until my brother started crying and going histerical so we got back in the car and left.  We went to the store and when we came back through it was gone.  There is nothing else this thing could have been than a UFO.  I seen it so close and for such a long time with many people there with me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177

Driving down 1 26 on the way to open mic in Asheville drivin by Brevard road exit at sunset also looking at the clock noticing it was 8:30 after the event had happened, The benefit of mr kite was playing, and when witness 1 saw something a saucer shaped object with I would say neon lights almost too bright to see, it hovered for a little while and then went diagonally down behind the trees it seemed really close but it was hard to tell it could have been 200 yards or it could have been far away. Witness 1  at first said to witness 2 while drivin in the car, Hey, that doesnâ€™t look like a normal kind of plane does it? We both agreed it looked like the stereotypical UFO.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
