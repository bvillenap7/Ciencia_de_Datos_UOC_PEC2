Big As  House, Rows of Brightly Lit Windows, Silent;1977-06-15 21:00:00;10 minutes;Big As  House, Rows of Brightly Lit Windows, Silent While driving at night, my husband & I first noticed a bright light in the sky that was moving slowly. As we kept on driving we could see it get closer. Suddenly it appeared at treetop level, it was as big as a house, with very bright lights coming from rows of windows. They were so bright we couldnt make out the exact shape, but seemed to be saucer or disc shaped. It was completely quiet, it seemed to just float slowly over the treetops. It passed directly over our vehicle, across the road, over a golf course & just kept on going.. There were other cars on the road that had to see it too, we just kept on driving, my husband stuck his head out of the window as it passed over, he saw colored lights on the bottom. I was so scared that I literally got in the floor of the car & started praying. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177

What WAS that?;2003-09-06 21:00:00;less than 30 seconds;What WAS that? Don't have much detail to give but last night both my husband and I saw something we've NEVER seen before.  It was an aircraft traveling at a speed that was unbelievably fast.  Ten times faster than any jet we've seen.  Also it had red and green lights that were very bright and visible.  It passed over us so fast.  Too dark so couldn't make out a shape.  How could we go about finding out what that was?  Is there such an aircraft?  Not sure what we saw.  Neither one of us is really a believer in UFO's.  If it's a legitimate aircraft, how can we go about identifying it?  Oh, just remembered another detail.  At the time of this sighting we had the hot tub on which is kind of noisy.  When we sighted this object we heard no noise from it, which usually you could hear a jet over the hot tub motor.  We turned off the hot tub and still heard nothing.  Very strange and has made us wonder.  Please advise of a source to ID this and weather there's such a legitimate aircraft that fits this description. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed quite credible to us.  Because of the red and green lights the witnesses observed on the object, we strongly suspect that it might have been some type of terrestrial aircraft, although that is a guess.

2 UFO sightings in my area in the last week!;2006-04-22 21:00:00;2 minutes;2 UFO sightings in my area in the last week! Last night, while taking my nightly stroll through my apartment complex, I was looking up at the sky observing the stars. The sky was pretty clear considering we had thunderstorms earlier that day. I spotted what I took at first to be a star because It was a bright yellowish white colour, solid throughout and very high in the sky. However, I then noticed it was moving. I stopped walking and watched it. It was flying in a strait pattern but going rather too fast and smooth for an airplane. I took off my headphones to listen for sound, to make sure it wasn't a plane or for some bizaree reason a helicopper (though it seemed too high up for this) I couldn't hear anything but the normal car noises ect. It didnt have any light changes and I didn't see any red lights or pulsating lights like on a plane. I walked forwards to watch it until it disapeared behind a tress near by. I continued on my walk, shortly afterward, maybe three minutes later, a plan flew over head. It looked nothing like what I saw minutes before and was at the normal height in the sky. This is strange to me because its the second sighting I've had in the last week. I can't remember the exact day, I think It was Tuesday or Wednesday. It was about 1:30-2:00pm I was driving to see a friend at work when I noticed a a silvery object really high in the sky, higher then I had ever seen a plane go. It's shape was somewhat circular and I couldn't make out any wings. I observed it until I turned a corner and it was gone from my view. Both sighting I was alone.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Large Sighting of Green Lights Seen In WNC During Night Of Jan 24th,;2007-01-24 19:00:00;4 hours;Large Sighting of Green Lights Seen In WNC During Night Of Jan 24th, WLOS TV reported during the 11pm weather segment they had been flooded during the night by callers reporting green lights dancing in the sky.  They said they had experienced a surprisingly high volume of callers.   With the green lights having been seen some weeks back from this same area and also on the same night seen as far to the west as Alaska of these same kind of reported green lights and in some cases also being chased by fighter craft - and a possible crash retival in Columbas Ga - the apperance of a large sighting of green lights in this area seems important and to see again if part of a larger pattern.   Will call and ask the WLOS TV weather man to direct callers who make such reports to this website for documentation. ((NUFORC Note:  We received several reports about these lights, but we do not know what they were.  PD));35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Large white light with a red hue low in the western sky.  Remained for 20 min or more then vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2010-08-19 21:20:00;20-30 min;Large white light with a red hue low in the western sky. Remained for 20 min or more then vanished. I am a 38 year old male Mental Health Professional. I have never claimed to have seen a UFO, nor am I sure what exactly I saw last night.  I've come to this website to see if any other's witnessed what I saw or if there is some kind of reasonalble explanation.  While sitting in front of my home, I noticed a very bright white light whith a red hue low in the western sky.  At first I thought it was a low flying plane, as there is a small airport nearby.  But then I noticed it wasn't really moving. It was hard to determine if it was in our atmosphere or in space.  Then I began to think perhaps it was a very bright star or planet, but it just seemed too big for that and the red hue didn't make sense.  I couldn't really determine what it might be. I called to my wife and a visting friend who witnessed it as well. Star, plant, plane they came to the same conclusion as me.  I called a neighbor and he and his family witnessed it as well. They had a pair of binoculars and ! indicated that it was round with a red hue.  They could not determine if it was in our atmosphere or not.  We watched it for about 15-20 minutes, and then it made an apparent wobble to the left and the white light disappeared.  You could then see a faint red twinkling hue in it's place.  At one point, about 3-4 min. following the bright light's disappearance, there was another flash or shimmer resembling the largewhite light that lasted about 2 seconds.  I watched the red twinkling hue for another 5-10 minutes before clouds moved in and obscured my view completely.  I live in North Asheville, and called a friend in South Asheville to see if he had noticed the light.  He, in fact, had noticed it while driving home, and had thought it to be an oddly large, bright planet.  He suggested that perhaps it was a large meteor.  I called the local paper shortly after to see if anyone else had reported it, but no one had at that time.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177

I was watching the meteor shower scheduled tonight.  Saw many meteors, stopped counting at 30.   What I had thought was a star started moving, fast!...  At first I thought might be a satellite.  Noticed was moving too fast, as I have watched satellies before, many times.  As a child, I stayed w/ my grandparents every summer, far from city lights.  Every night I would watch a satilite move across the sky. Vary dim, could barely see it. Steady and slow.  This object was moving vary fast.  Made its way across the sky in a seconds.  Also, changing directions (twice!), before disappearing in the light on the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

UFO followed by JETS;2016-01-21 11:30:00;90 seconds;UFO followed by JETS. A friend and I were talking on the phone as we worked outside.  He quickly interupted the conversation by yelling, Dude dude dude!!! Do you see that?  Somethings falling from the sky!??!   At this time, I did not see anything.  We were working on different sides of the city and looking at the sky from different angles.   About a minute later, I saw something and asked if that's what he was seeing.  He said, Yes!   At first I was skeptical.  It looked like a small odd shaped cloud, with a small, fat trail behind it.  I thought maybe it was a jet, but it was moving and in a strange way far off in the sky.  I lost it for a minute behind some trees and I ask my friend if it was gone and he agreed that it had just disappeared into thin air.  We were talking about what we saw when oddly enough a jet appeared from the area where the object had vanished and flew in a Southwest direction.  Then I saw 2 jets, 3, 4, and literally stopped counting at 15.  All! actual jets flying in the same direction.  East to Southwest.  Like they were following or chasing something which was the strangest part of all of this.  It was an extremely strange experience to say the least.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
At 11:30 am I witnessed a seemingly round craft flying west to east in the sky directly above me.;2016-01-21 11:30:00;30 seconds;I'm a mailman in Asheville, NC.    At 11:30 am, I witnessed a seemingly round craft flying west to east in the sky directly above me.  I saw it for approximately 30 seconds and in the blink of an eye it disappeared.  It left little to no trail behind it like you would see coming from a jet.   After it disappeared, at least 7 jets moving in rapid succession, flew in all directions as if they were looking for the object.   Right now it is 12:12 pm and jets are still flying overhead as I'm typing this.   My friend who is also a ((deleted--public employee)) in downtown Asheville witnessed the same thing as we talked on the phone.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
