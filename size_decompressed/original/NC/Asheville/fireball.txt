Three orange dots rising from horizon and dying out one by one;2012-04-07 21:28:00;5:00;Three orange dots rising from horizon and dying out one by one While waiting for the moon to rise, approximately an hour after the sun set, three orange/red lights rose from behind the mountains on the horizon.  They looked closer than stars, and at first seemed to be very slow moving fireworks.  They rose together, formed a triangle, and then kept on rising.  The one on the farthest right died out, and after the last two rose for a bit more the second on the right died. Then the last light kept on moving up, and then hovered for about a minute before slowly moving right and then dying out.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
