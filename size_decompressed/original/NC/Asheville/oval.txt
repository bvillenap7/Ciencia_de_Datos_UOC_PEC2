Yellow/Redish colored UFO on the Blue Ridge Parkway in Asheville,NC.;1991-08-22 22:30:00;5 minutes;Yellow/Redish colored UFO on the Blue Ridge Parkway in Asheville,NC. I observed an oval shaped object rise over a nearby mountain on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  The object had many lights on it which did not flash.  The UFO was approximatly 1/2-1 mile from me in the air as it ascended above the mountain top.   The UFO then slowly moved above my location and then streaked across the sky covering aproximately 30-50 miles in about 1-2 seconds.  The UFO then stopped then began to fly north across the mountain range, eventually disappearing from my sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident may be approximate.

Bright oval-shaped object flying at considerable height in the night sky;2021-01-14 22:15:00;30 minutes;Bright oval-shaped object flying at considerable height in the night sky Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) over Asheville, NC. Observed a UFO in the eastern night sky over Haw Creek residential area in Asheville, North Carolina  on the night of 14 January 2021, around 10:30pm? I stood outside of my home for over 30 minutes watching this very bright object move silently in the sky along a southerly track. There were no blinking navigation lights as a helicopter or aircraft would present. There were, however, lights which were rotating in a clockwise motion around the bottom of the craft and there was one central light at the top of the object that remained motionless.  This UFO was elongated and oval in shape hovering at an altitude I would guess to be between 500 to 1000 feet. From this altitude, the object would have to have been much larger than a Boeing 777 aircraft due to the size it present in the sky. It moved downward as well as from side to side. It didn't move erratically or in jerky motions. Instead, it moved very slowly as though it was watching something or was doing some type of reconnaissance.  I had my phone, but it was so dark on this night that the camera could not acquire a focused image to record either as a photograph or video. The iPhone did place a square in my view finder which indicated that it did detect an object though. At or about 10:50 pm, the object sped off at high speed in an upward direction to the west and disappeared from view. To my knowledge, two other people saw the object as well and could not identify it as a normal aircraft.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
