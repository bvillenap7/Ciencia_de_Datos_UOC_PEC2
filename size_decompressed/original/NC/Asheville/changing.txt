Morphing Sphere UFO;2011-08-04 01:20:00;1 -2 minutes;Morphing Sphere UFO i was driving my car home from a friends house late.  was driving down road on the interstate, going approx. 50 an hr. suddenly, a red morphing object appeared above the interstate sign probably 20 feet above it. it came into illumination at night in front of my car coming horizontal in the sky, it seemed to appear from the direction to my right. the object was the brightest red ive ever seen, and single morphing undiscernable shape. it was red, then morphed and the colors changed from brown, black , then the brightest blue in front of my eyes. inside, as it changed formation, i notice objects inside, such as wire types or techincal machinery. it was browning, caramal mixed with blackish inside. i could not really describe what the type of wires i was seeing, it was like a long cylinder with barbwire wrapped around. i felt like i might be looking at the underside back side view of the craft. i took out my camera and snapped two photos as proof, because id see! n a different craft 2 weeks earlier.  i felt like it was wondering what my lights from car were, as if it startled it, and the color changing and morphing was its identification meter. it kept its blue shape, then floated over to a building in the city, and stayed over it looming above with the brightest blue shape. i drove away and went home, i felt in awe like my mind couldnt believe what it was seeing. only when i got home and went to my room did what happen really hit me. its like my mind wouldnt come to terms with it. i still cant get this experience out of my head.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177

Fiery orange changing shapes in nightsky moving at different angles or directions toward the east;2014-06-12 21:00:00;5 minutes;fiery orange changing shapes in nightsky moving at different angles or directions toward the east At 9:00 p.m. on June 12, 2014, my friend and I saw over the Kenilworth section of Asheville, NC, groups of orange fiery lights or shapes that would head in to cluster, then cross, and drift apart.  We saw this phenomena as it drifted toward the east (individually, not as a piece) for five minutes as a hot-air balloons might.  Objects, comparatively speaking, were much bigger than a star.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
