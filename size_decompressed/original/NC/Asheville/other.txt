Large, white star or planet-shaped object that appeared to divide in 2 parts, circling each other, slowly, then accelerating until stop;1972-06-02 05:00:00;15 mins.;Large, white star or planet-shaped object that appeared to divide in 2 parts, circling each other, slowly, then accelerating until stopping abruptly with one object separated travelling South in a straight line. Having had several unusual sightings and occurances during my lifetime, I was driving the last leg of my morning paper route when I noticed an unusually large object in the sky out of the driver-side window. For awhile, I had a strange feeling it was following or pacing me. Trying to discount paranoia, I decided it was just there. I thought it was the Planet Venus, but it was twice the expected size. As I approached the stop sign at the junction of the main road, I decided to pull over, get out, stretch my legs and gaze at this thing. Shortly, the object appeared to quiver, separate into two parts, and spin faster and faster,counterclockwise around each other before coming to an abrupt halt. One object appeared to accelerate to the South while the other remained stationary. During this sighting, I shook my head, rubbed my eyes, pinched myself (it hurt!), but I was not asleep. I kept sight of the remaining object until I reached home. The importance of this seemed to dissolve, but the memory remains vivid.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
an object was sited around the asheville area that was travelling westward. it was brilliantly lit and appeared to be moving very fast.;1997-05-15 21:00:00;both events 1 minuite;Summary : an object was sited around the asheville area that was travelling westward. it was brilliantly lit and appeared to be moving very fast. my partner and i were approaching an overlook on the blue ridge parkway just after nightfall, unfortunately, i cannot recall an exact date and time. as we approached the outlook, which was likely at an elevation of over 2000 ft., a solid, dazzling orange light appeared in the sky over the valley and was still for a moment. it then banked down and towards the right, and the brightness of the light dimmed and it moved. it reminded me of fire. we kept going hoping to get a better view. by the time we stopped the car there was no sign of the light. we exited off the parkway and went through all of the validity tests we could think of. no aircraft could manoeuvre with those angles and speeds at what seemed to be a fairly close distance to the mountain. we thought of as many other logical scenarios (hoping to find one) but nothing fit. as we neared the town of weaverville, we saw the same solid orange light move swiftly and low to the ground, but unfortunately our viewing angle wa!s poor and it was out of sight before long.we talked with a friend who lives on a mountain in the same area, who corraborated our story independantly, except he was able to see the complete path the object took for at least seven minutes. he said that hours later a fleet of helicopters passed in formation through the valley with searchlights, though there were no reports of crashed aircraft or any other crime scene that would call for a searchlight. i do have a belief that what we saw was extraordinary, but only after we have applied every rational test we could conceive of.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
TRIANGULAR MOVEMENT OF TWO LIGHTS OVER ASHEVILLE, NC;1999-11-14 02:00:00;4+ hours;TRIANGULAR MOVEMENT OF TWO LIGHTS OVER ASHEVILLE, NC We were seated on a moutain overlooking the city of Ashville.  It was night, and very cold.  We decided to wrap ourselves in a pile of blankets and watch the characteristic smoke enter the valley below.  As the mist covered the city, and all we could see was ambient light, our gaze shifted upward to the stars. At first, we thought that what we saw was simply a star until it moved in a triangular pattern.  It was a red/blue light that was about 4-5 miles away, high above the city below.  Scared, we ran to our car for shelter.  Our two dogs that we had with us suddenly became silent....and believe me they had been fussing most of the night until this light appeared. Once inside the car, another light, yellow and green hovered to the west of where we were looking.  This was about 500 yards away.  It hovered behind the treeline and then above it.  It moved in the same triangle pattern as the other light.  We locked the doors and watched for about 3-4 hours more before passing out of exhaustion.  I do recall feeling like my mind was being read, and as I thought this my friend asked me if I felt as though I were being scanned. WE WERE NOT ON DRUGS AND ARE BOTH CHRISTIANS BUT I MUST SAY THAT THIS EVENT HAS HAUNTED ME EVER SINCE.  WE NEVER SPEAK OF THIS INSTANCE SINCE WAKING IN THE EARLY DAWN.  WE CONFRIMED OUR SIGHTING TO EACH OTHER AND THEN DROPPED IT. My research has uncovered the mystery surrounding the Brown Mountain Lights that US Geological teams have investigated with NO results. What the hell were these lights?????;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
a very bright slow moving large object with no sound, awsome!;2010-12-31 21:05:00;1 min;a very bright slow moving large object with no sound, awsome! Just saw UFO at about 2105, traveling across the sky slowly about 1 min.  About the size of a Â½ dollar with no stars in the sky.  Looked like it was on fire- hot orange.  In the shape of a sideways U with the curve facings northwest from my home.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
