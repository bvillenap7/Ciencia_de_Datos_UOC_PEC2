Has always been considered a creepy location /  make out area / and actually is very sceneic.  I was with a friend named ((name deleted)).  His father worked at UNCA as a debunker.  I had 2 other UFO encounters and we were at this location discussing paranormal subjects.  We both were about 20 years old. We had been there a little over an hour, and the ironic thing was ((name deleted)) was telling me that he did not believe in ghosts and UFOs and was giving me a speech about rational thinking.  I suffer from an abnormal epileptic condition, and have noted when i see UFO i feel a tingling sensation that is in the epileptic family of sensation for me.  I told ((name deleted)) this and he said we were going to sit there till i admited this was none rational thinking.  This converation was nearing 9pm.  By about 9:15 was getting dark, cold, and starting to get hungry.  I still felt the sensation, but wanted to leave as was not dressed to be on a Mt after dark.  I was just about to admit to him was being irrational when i felt the sensation grow very intense.  We were sitting on large rocks and over ((name deleted)) shoulder i could see what appeared to be a falling star falling from directly overhead, and should quickly vansih behind a Mt we were facing.  ((name deleted)) saw it and said...  that is just.....  He paused as right before the object should have vanished it stopped above the tree line.  It was not very bright, and would say the Mt. across from us was maybe 2 to 3 miles away across the Beaver Dam area of N. Asheville.  ((name deleted)) stared at the object and was speechless.  It slowly bloomed to be much brighter.  It was mainly intense white in color, but was so bright it appeared blue at the edges on the light.  The light appeared more in rays than round coming from it and seemed to pulse with energy.  I was now tingling all over with the electrical sensation.  The object danced up above the tree lines and did shapes, then would drop below the mt area.  But near instantly would come back up in another area of the mt.  This went on for a period of about a min.  My friend was speaking random curses such as well ((deleted)) I cannot be seeing seeing this ((deleted)) thing  Even, My dad is going to dis-own me if i tell him this!  Suddenly the object pulled up above the MT.  and speed up and away from us in a burst of speed and simple went out of visible site.  My friend ((name deleted)) looked at me and asked me if i was still feeling funny... and i answered him... even stronger now then before and started getting very frightened as right when i said this we heard sticks snap in every direction around us.  The car was about 75 feet up the hill from us and almost instantly hearing what sounded like hundreds of footsteps we made a mad dash for his Honda.  We did not take time to even open the doors... we were absolutely scared out of our wits.  ((name deleted)) dropped his keys trying to start the car.  Finally he was able to get it started and we drove down this very poorly made dirt road far faster than was safe.  After getting off the hill we came to an Ingle's grocery store that is about 3 miles away on the main road and went in simply to be near other people as we were so freaked out.  We sooner after went back to my home where a large group of our friends were visiting that night.  We all told the story to everyone there and we both were stil scared out of our wits.  I was trying to figure out if i sense the thing coming - or if i actually attracted it.  I have not talked to ((name deleted)) since in my mid 20's.... but am sure he would still collaborate the details of this story.  Have had 4 UFO experiences in my life.. and feel as a result they increase ESP and just cause changes in awareness.  ((name deleted)) reported after this night seeing a UFO again during a lake campout and suddenly having odd ESP and paranormal activities that became consistant for him also.  If there is any desire to get him to file a report i can give you info so as to be able to contact him if you deemed it valuable. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will await the corroborating report from the other witness.  Source of this report describes self as having an engineering degree.  PD));35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Red light moved slowly over Asheville, dogs acted is if they were in pain.;1998-10-12 19:00:00;40 min;Red light moved slowly over Asheville, dogs acted is if they were in pain. My daughter and I were going to the KFC to pick up food.  We were traveling down Leicester Hwy and saw a red ball of light.  It was in the western sky.  We pulled over to the Ingles parking lot and called my wife on the cell phone to look outside from our house and see if she could see it.  By this time approx. 18 cars pulled in around me to look at the object.  None of us could figure it out.  The light would move up and down left and right slowly.  My wife grabed our dogs and got in the car headed for us.  She said the dogs started wailing like they were hurting. When she got to us the dogs would not come out of the car and huddled in the floor board.  When we tryed to pick them up they were stiff, as if they were scared. More people including 2 Asheville Police cars pulled into the Ingles parking lot to view the object.  It evently drifted South West, came off and on slowly, then just dissapeared. We watched the local WLOS news and a proffesor from UNCA said it could be a planet.  But planets don't move.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
red drifting light about 50 degrees in the western sky slowly drifting up and to the north would get very bright then fade but not puls;1998-10-15 19:00:00;30 mins;red drifting light about 50 degrees in the western sky slowly drifting up and to the north would get very bright then fade but not pulsating finally disapering all together about the 2ed week in oct 98 at aprx 7 pm I was riding in a golf cart at the hotel where I work when i noticed a bright glowing red light high in the western sky. so i parked and went around the back of the hotel and walked up a fire escape to get a better look. it was glowing bright red and about the size and brightness of venus or jupiter at there closesed approch. it seemed to be very high in alt and very far away. it was drifting very slowly up and to the north (i was looking west) it would get very bright and fade but not pulsating just kinda intermittently some times fading out compleatly for a few secs or fade to were it was barely visable and then slowly brightening again. i saw several aircraft flying nearby so i know they had to have seen it also. i observed the object for about 10 mins and finally walked down the fire escape to the side door of the giftshop and ask the cashier to come have a look at this. she and i watched for about 5 more mins and it finaly disipeared compleatly. we discused it for a few mins and i went back to the bellstand in front of the hotel. a few mins later 2 guys from housekeeping came by on there rounds and i was telling them what i had seen.  there imeadate reaction was it was a tower. i was telling them how high it was and what direction when one of them said  is that it? it was there again in the same part of the sky i had first seen it. so we went back around back (there is 2 doors leading throught a corodor that takes u from front to back where the gift shop and the proshop are located if u r wondering how we could get from front to back so quickly no lost time here LOL:) i got the cashier and we all 4 watched for about 5 mins. we all agreed it was very strange (except for 1 of the housemen he said it was an aircraft (hes not very bright) lol). about then i got a call on the radio so i had to leave. the cashier had customers so she had to go and one of the housemen said he didnt have time for this(guess witch one) but the other houseman told me later that he watched for about 5 more mins and it had drifted back up and to the south (we were looking west) and finaly faded out. the next morning it was reported on WLOS that a number of people from the leicster community (wnw of the hotel 5 to 10 miles away) had reported a bright glowing red light in the western sky. it was also reported that they had checked with asheville regonal airport controllers and nothing unusual was seen on radar. an astronomy professor from UNCA stated that was prob a star that sometimes glows red during that time of year.                                                                                     iv worked as a ((deleted)) there for about 6 years and iv lived in asheville for 32 years.  im very fimilar with the geography of the area and the numerous cellphone and communication towers on the surounding mountian tops. this was not a hotair balloon flying at night nor was it a star or any other posible explanition i can think of  any segustions??

I looked up and saw a very bright light.  I stared at the light and it seemed to know I was watching it.  As I was staring at the light, I suddenly realized that I was lying on the porch that I was recently smoking on.  I jumped to my feet, and the light was still there as it was before.  As I looked at the light like I was mesmerized, it began to get smaller and smaller until it seemed to be sucked into another dimension or something.  As it disappeared for my vision, there was a loud boom sound that was loud enough to wake my wife up.  She heard the boom, but she did not see the light.  A lot of strange things happened after this incidence, but I will not go into that because it really creeped me and my wife out.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Bright White Light Moving Slower Then Normal Aircraft.;2005-01-20 23:45:00;10 mins;Bright White Light Moving Slower Then Normal Aircraft. I went outside for a cigarette and noticed what looked to be a light on top of a nearby mountain top.  It looked as if it was moving slowly, so I kept an eye on it to determine if it was moving.  Once I was sure it was moving I was thinking it was a plane or a helicopter.  There was no noise as would be normal with a aircraft.   I then noticed that it was moving way to slow for a plane.  I kept watching as it started to move closer and closer to my direction.  It went into some trees and shone brighter then before and then it just vanished.   At first I was thinking it was behind the trees so I kept waiting for it to clear and come into view again. It never came back into view and I even went to higher ground and couldn't see it.   After another 10 mins or so of looking I gave up and decided it had just vanished. This is the second time I have seen strange lights in the area.  I am looking for similar reports from my area.  Thanks;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
two dim lights following too closely to be satellites or airplanes...;2008-07-27 22:00:00;3-5 minutes;two dim lights following too closely to be satellites or airplanes... We were looking at the sky to the North, because the stars were out and it was pretty. We noticed two dim white lights following each other at a speed a little faster than a satellite. They were traveling from the South to the North, and following each other too closely to actually be satellites... and definitley not airplanes. We watched them pass for 3 to 5 minutes, and then the trees blocked our view. They stayed on a straight path, no variation, no changes in speed.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Silent white lights slowly move low in the sky then vanish.;2009-11-23 18:25:00;30 seconds;Silent white lights slowly move low in the sky then vanish. Me my daughter and another friend witnessed 2 UFO's in Asheville, NC, on Nov. 23 2009 at 6:25pm. Two bright white lights traveling very slowly in an easterly direction at the exact same pace as if they were connected. each one was about the size of a quarter at arms length. no more than a 1/2 mile away. As thay went behind the neighbors house i went to see them on the other side and they were gone. No noise no flashing red or green lights. Never have i witnessed this before. Lasted about 30 seconds. When i returned about 10 min later I saw helocopters with search lights in the area where the lights vanished.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Two gaslike lights moving in circular manner in southern sky;2010-10-27 20:15:00;30 MINUTES;Two gaslike lights moving in circular manner in southern sky I was walking dog in backyard and I noticed moving lights above the trees in my yard. They were moving in a circular manner -two separate whitish lights.  They were fairly bright when I noticed them. I knocked on my 21 year old son's window and told him to come outside.  They were as bright when he saw them as they were for me.  I then told him to get my other son.   All three of us had never seen anything like it.  The lights were in the southern sky from my house.  They did not appear to be real high up  It is overcast and sort of foggy.  We first thought if someone had a flashlight or two.  But really, we could not see any light trails and basically there is nothing behind my house except fields.  The lights faded out from what they were at the start but kept going in circular manner for 30 mintues or so but not in the same tracks.  Looking up they would appear stongest on the right side of the circle and disappear on the left side of the circle.  If you s! aw Close Encounters, they moved as fast as those lights, but were different. They were gaseous looking lights -sort of cloudlike.  Really weird. There were no noises at all from these lights.  We are located in a rural setting.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177

Star sized color changing lights moving in weird patterns, white and orange balls falling from sky.;2011-12-18 01:00:00;4 hours;star sized color changing lights moving in weird patterns, white and orange balls falling from sky. I was outside grabbing my phone charger out of my car when in my peripheral vision I noticed a bright white ball flying through the air and then swiftly falling to the ground leaving clouds of fog behind (the rest of the sky was completely clear). I ran inside to grab my 3 friends thinking a plane had crashed. When we all got out side we noticed while  looking up at the sky we saw 30-40 star-sized lights changing colors, some blue to green, some blue to orange. As we observed the sky we noticed that the lights we saw were darting randomly  around the sky like nothing we had ever seen. Zig-zagging and moving up and down. Also shooting beams of light through the sky. We stood out there watching them do this for three hours. Later after going inside I noticed blinking white lights from a window coming from  the same place the white orb was seen. I went out side and saw two orange orbs side by side float up from behind a tree line, move about 500ft right and then quickly fall to the ground.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
West Asheville UFO Sightings;2012-08-20 21:00:00;2 hours;West Asheville UFO Sightings On the night of August 20th and again August 23rd  UFOs were observed from my apartment community in West Asheville/ Leicester Hwy. Red, green, and white lights blinking back and forth to another craft were seen to the right and left of the moon both around 9pm. Both areas with blinking lights stayed hovering for over 2 hours each time until they disappeared. They were much higher than a plane would go and to stay in just one spot.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Star-like bright light floats and flys across sky.;2013-08-03 22:00:00;1 minute;Star-like bright light floats and flys across sky. Saw a vibrant bright star like object floating across the sky at what seemed like incredible speed.  Within one of the lower atmospheres, flying lower than an airplane which I saw right above it.  The light moved at a steady pace and was extremely similiar to a star in its appearance. I observed the light flying and within a minute it was gone off into the distance.  No blinking lights, strange arching flight pattern.  Also, I noticed a strange film or layer of particles around the light, but this could just be the intensity of the light causing a glow affect versus any kind of significant detail. Light made no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
