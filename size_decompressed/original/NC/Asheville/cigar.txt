Had wings, but more squared-shape,mostly black all over, with orange or red lines denoting the sections from underneath.   Saw it while turning into a drive that led to a parking lot.  Once we looked back, it had disappeared.  And, what was striking, it had been moving slowly, and lower than an airplane would fly, especially in that area.  My friend and I compared notes on what we saw was unable to get a photo, but definitely was not a notable object to this area.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Two cigar shaped objects spotted over downtown Asheville, NC.;2012-07-29 21:00:00;2 minutes;Two cigar shaped objects spotted over downtown Asheville, NC. We were in downtown Asheville, NC walking across Biltmore Ave to the parking garage.  The streets were being cleared from the Belle Chere Festival.  There were very few pedestrians on the street.  We were planning on going stargazing that evening, so I glanced up at a patch of blue sky to the south of us, when I saw a large cigar/cylindrical shaped object moving across the sky.  It looked like a shiny silver cigar...flying at about the same distance, and speed that a commercial aircraft would be traveling, only there was no com-trail, and no noise.  I was able to point the object out to my other three companions.  Everyone saw it move across the sky, and then disappear into a cloud.   As soon as it disappeared, another identical craft came into view, and it followed the same path, eventually disappearing into the same cloud cover.  It was very strange.  If anyone else saw these objects, please post!;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Object gave off a bright flash of light and disapeared;2017-03-23 07:50:00;2 minutes;Object gave off a bright flash of light and disapeared Unidentified object spotted driving East on I-26 just south of Asheville, NC.  Object appeared to be moving at the speed of a large low flying plane and was cigar shaped.  I was traveling near the Asheville airport, so I thought it was only a low flying plane at a distance of approximately 3 miles however it seemed rather odd shaped for a plane so I continued to glance up at the object while driving. The last time I looked up at the object it appeared to take a sharp turn south and gave off a bright silver flash of light and disappeared.  It was bright enough that it made me close my eyes for just a split second, then look back only to find the object no where in sight.  I watched the area that the flash came from for about 30 second, thinking I would see the object flying off.  The object had disappeared.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
