dark pill shaped object over the black mountain range;2020-01-28 09:45:00;5 seconds;dark pill shaped object over the black mountain range Jan. 28th 2020  I drove into the golds gym parking lot because i was looking and taking pictures of the snow that fell on the black mountains.  I took multiple pictures from various vantage points within the same area of the mountain range that was visible after I parked the car and held my arm out of the window to get a better shot, I took multiple pictures in succession.Later planning to review them and find the best picture . I did not see this object when taking the pictures. I was holding my arm out of the car window because the front windshield is cracked and i didnt want those in the pictures . Later in the evening, I was scrolling through the pictures I had taken and noticed a black dot that i didn't see when taking them .I realized that the dot was no where in the other pictures that were taken merely seconds behind the previous ones. I realized that the black dot is not normal . The skies were clear no precipitation at all. The span of the mountain range I was taking pictures of is about 15 miles so any known aircraft would have shown up in a different picture but it did not .it was there then it was gone . While sitting there taking pictures over the course of 2 or 3 minutes i didn't witness any aircraft in the sky ,I didn't even notice this until I reviewed them later. I do not know how any craft we are familiar with would be there one second and gone the next.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
