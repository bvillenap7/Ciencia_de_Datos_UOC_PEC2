Lineal pattern, sequential, star-like lights seen flying for 15 minutes in Asheville, NC.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-13 21:30:00;15;Lineal pattern, sequential, star-like lights seen flying for 15 minutes in Asheville, NC. Objects that appeared exactly like stars in the sky but moving in a lineal pattern across the sky. Appearing from the horizon and moving out of sight. Unable to determine how many there were but it was absolutely sequential. Traveling at the same speed and the same width apart. Something like this:  .          .          .          .          .          .          .          .          .           .          .          .           .          .          .  The objects were way too high to be drones, way too many to be satellites, way too slow to be shooting stars, and much too organized. I donâ€™t know exactly when the even started but by the time I noticed it happening to the time the event finished, 10-15 minutes had transpired. Objects seen between three Marias and brightest star visible in the sky.  Even seen in Asheville, NC. Very near Hendersonville Rd. In an apartment complex parking lot.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
