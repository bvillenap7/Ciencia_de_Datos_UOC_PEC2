it hovered above us for a while.....;1995-04-15 22:00:00;it seemed like 15+ mins.;it hovered above us for a while..... we were on hwy.26 getting ready to enter hwy.40 when the craft was noticed by my son above us and to the right (the passenger side of the car) i looked and saw it as well. it was black with several lights and was hovering above us. it seemed as if we were stopped but i know we did not stop. my husband was driving and he leaned over to see it through my window. it just kept right over us shining a bright light like it was daylight. to this day my son and i remember it well. my husband has only slight memory of it. he says it brothers him to talk about it. it also makes my son and i feel uncomfortable. even as i write this i feel like i am doing something wrong. does that make sense to you? its just a weird feeling. when it left, it just flew off and disappeared at a high rate of speed.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
Large trianular craft.  ((anonymous reports));2018-10-19 10:00:00;15 minutes;Large trianular craft I went out onto my porch to smoke a cigarette and saw a large trianglular craft over my apartment building.  It was black and about the size of a football field and had bright orange lights on each corner.  It moved slowly over my building and I walked out to the other side of my building.  It started tilted nose up slightly and froze for about a minute.  Then did the same for all three corners of the ship.  It started spinning slowly and moving forward then disappeared.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
