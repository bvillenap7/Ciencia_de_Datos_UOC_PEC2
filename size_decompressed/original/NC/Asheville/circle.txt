Round orange light, silent and slow moving, suddenly changes direction and shrinks to a pinpoint, disappears.;2012-08-24 22:45:00;2-3 minutes;Round orange light, silent and slow moving, suddenly changes direction and shrinks to a pinpoint, disappears. Was talking with my friend on her screen porch.  I was sitting with my back to the house, facing my friend, when I noticed to my left (peripheral vision) a bright light in the sky - I said to my friend &quotIs that a planet?&quot since it was so bright but when I looked directly at it I realized it was much bigger than a bright planet.  It was orange, slightly more orange than an orange street light.  My friend's first thought was that it might be a helicopter, because she sees helicopters coming from the direction of Mission hospital (which was the direction of this object), so we listened for a helicopter sound, but didn't hear anything. Both of us thought it was too close to not hear some kind of sound if it were a helicopter or an airplane.  I stepped outside of the screen porch to get a better view of it without the screen in the way.  The object was getting slowly bigger, so it seemed to be moving towards us.  Then suddenly, it got slightly brighter ! and almost seemed to be turning at a sharp angle and then suddenly it shrank to a pinpoint and disappeared.  I kept looking at the same place in the sky and saw a very very faint light that was moving in the same direction of the sharp angle that the object had turned.  Then that faint light faded away. We are guessing the light came from the direction of south Asheville. My friend saw a similar object during daylight hours five days later - I will ask her to file a separate report.

Strange light, was inspected by 3 helicopters.. Please read.. I need to know if others experienced something like this..;2014-10-27 07:50:00;8:15;Strange light, was inspected by 3 helicopters.. Please read.. I need to know if others experienced something like this.. So my boyfriend and I walked outside to smoke, and we saw this strange object in the sky, moving in slow motions, back and forth, up and down... It was so bright, and it seemed as if it flashes red at some points.. So we continued to watch, and then we saw a helicopter approach it,a and it shined it's lights directly down onto it..  So my boyfriend and I were really intrigued now..  That helicopter left, and about 5 minutes later, we see this other one coming, and my boyfriend said  be ready to see something strange happen..  And it passed it at first, then turned right back around, and shined it's lights down straight on it, and circle it.. It circled it for about 10 minutes... And I was just, in shock..  The helicopter left, and a third one came along, and did the same thing.. So we assume that people have been calling and reporting this strange object. My boyfriend and I went inside for about, 20 minutes, and went back outside, it had vanished. I ! just want to see if others had witnessed this, or something similar. I want to know what this was, and what's going on.;35.5540961071305;-82.5282822485177
