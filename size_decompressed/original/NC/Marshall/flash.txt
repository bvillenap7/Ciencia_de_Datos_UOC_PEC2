It was a consistent, faint strobe through out the sky.   The weather conditions were misty rain and very overcast, foggy and cloudy.  While looking up, you could faintly see it all over and it faded with daybreak so it never when away.   It had a consistent beat pattern like a heart.  Its color was a consistent illuminated white I would guess.   We are star gazers but never encountered anything like this.   Has anyone else seen this on a cloudy or clear day?;35.8597;-82.7105
