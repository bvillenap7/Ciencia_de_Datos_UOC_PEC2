By the time I got out I couldn't see it anymore, but we both observed a VERY unusual thick white smoky trace the type that airplanes leave.  The trace disappeared in midair.  Strangely, we both felt an incredibly strong energy current both inside and around, like suddenly the entire area had been charged with an electric charge of super strength.  What ensued was even more puzzling - a strong and continuous cacaphony of animal noises - wild barking of dogs most notably - permeated the air until 3 am.  I couldn't sleep that nite even for an hr.  I felt agitated, but also electrified, like I have been toughed with an electrifying stick;35.8597;-82.7105
