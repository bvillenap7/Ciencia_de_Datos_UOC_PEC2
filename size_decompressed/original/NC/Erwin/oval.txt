Large glowing lights of a craft over Erwin/Fayetteville area.;2019-05-21 09:50:00;10 minutes +;Large glowing lights of a craft over Erwin/Fayetteville area. Heading South toward Erwin from Highway 27, saw a stationary craft with three or more large orange light, a brighter glow around the craft and what appeared to be smaller lights of blue and white.  Drove toward the town of Erwin for 7 minutes and the craft neither pulled away or got any closer.   Crossed Highway 421 between DUNN and Erwin toward the Cape Fear River to get better view since the lights were blocked out by trees.   Drove toward LINDEN but could not see lights or craft.  Turned around and backtracked to a point where I had seen the light and nothing was there.   It was too large to be a helicopter, too slow to be an airplane.;35.3231;-78.6855
