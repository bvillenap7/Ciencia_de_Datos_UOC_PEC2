My girlfriend and I were traveling north on hwy.9 in Black Mountain, N.C. Just after we drove under I40 we saw about 10 lights high in the night sky. The lights were evenly spaced horizontally .If it was one object,it looked to be about 4 times the width of a full moon. Neither of us said anything about it for 3 minutes or so and then she just said It coldn't have been a house that high. That's when I realized I wasn't losing my mind. This all happened on 4/18/07 between 11:33 and 11:38 PM. The object didn't appear to be moving and the lights didn't blink accept for a slight flickering.The light were about the size of about 5 stars each.;35.5986;-82.2902
