Recurrent light formations, not matching aircraft or satellite patterns over Black Mountain, NC.;2015-01-18 22:15:00;3-4 minutes, recurrent on;Recurrent light formations, not matching aircraft or satellite patterns over Black Mountain, NC. Myself and 3 others were returning from a trip to downtown Asheville at approximately 22:00. We all were looking at constellations, as I am an astrophysics major, and Astronomy is a necessary study.  In between the Orion and Sagittarius constellations, I noticed two bright objects that looked like stars, but were not known stars, nor planets.  These lights could have been sattelites, but I have seen moving objects in the sky here that are moving erratically before, with others.  The two lights then moved slowly toward the center sky, and twisted Around each other somewhat erratically.  They were very high in altitude and faint compared to Sirius, Venus, and Alpha Centauri.  They then grew fainter and began to move much more quickly, then either disappeared due to speed or the lights being dimmed. Judging by their altitude as triangulated with the mountain range in the back ground. They were following the general direction of the train tracks, and moving from around 2 knots to around 870 knots from a near standstill.  They retained either a linear or somewhat triangular pattern, though the two rear lights have have been one reflecting off of frost in the atmosphere, or some other atmospheric disturbance.  This is not the first time I have seen these particular lights, and they are sometimes accompanied by infrasonic pitches of around 2-4 Hz or less, and sometimes a faint red center light.  The dogs in the neighborhood all get very loud when the infrasound begins, and if it flies at a lower altitude they all attempt to go inside or seek other shelter. I have detected very little radio static on any frequencies from the objects, and no noticeable sound. I have yet to try radar detection.;35.5986;-82.2902
