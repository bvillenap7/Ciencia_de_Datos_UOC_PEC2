Very Bright low Hanging Non-Moving Light with Solid Unlit Craft Nearby.;2018-04-09 23:20:00;45+ minutes;Very Bright low Hanging Non-Moving Light with Solid Unlit Craft Nearby. I am a truthful person, with my friend from church this night.  We both saw the same thing  I was driving home with a friend from Church, looking to my left (West) to see if the road was clear, I saw an odd looking low hanging “Light”.  I said my my friend “ WHAT IS THAT??”  She saw it then & exclaimed as I did. The light was just hanging low, very bright as a star, but it had kind of “Spikes” of light, even like a “Tail” of light. But is was all light, not other color.  It was too low for a star & it wasn’t moving, at least didn’t seem to be. I drove my car as I took pictures (!) then tried to find a hill unobstructed by trees & hills to take more pictures & to watch this thing. We spent probably close to an hour watching & taking pictures.  Most of them were from my phone.  Some videos were taken by me, as we watched it change shapes, in the videos it was pulsating a LOT. We got cold, it was late, so we reluctantly went home,  When I put the pictures on my computer I got a BIG surprise. There was an object in the last few pictures of that night.  It was in only 1 picture. We did not see this when we were watching. It obviously had no lights or sound ( or maybe it was too far to hear it) I can clearly see a “Craft” very close to this Light we were watching. Neither of us know what we saw, & I sure don’t know what this is on this 1 picture. I tried to edit it out, it won’t go away, so it is definitely there.  A solid object that we didn’t see.;35.5986;-82.2902
