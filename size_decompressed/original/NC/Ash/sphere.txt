Very large non blinking orangish red sphere seem to be strangely close and large.;2013-07-07 23:00:00;8 minutes;While I was getting ready for bed last night, looked out across the field and a very large non blinking orangish red sphere seem to be strangely close and large, floating upward, then it started moving North West, no blinking lights. It had a strange glow radiating from the bottom half of the sphere.  I was raised 1 mile from the runway at Pope Air Force base, never saw anything like this.....;34.0661;-78.501
