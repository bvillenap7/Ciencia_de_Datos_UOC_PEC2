Approximately 22:30 to 23:30, LOW IN THE NW SKY, THERE WAS A BRILLIANT BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT, THAT SEEMED TO SHIMMER AS IF IT WAS SLOWING DRIFTING OR MOVING BACK AND FORTH. I WATCHED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10  MINUTES, AS IT WAS STATIONARY THE ENTIRE TIME. WENT INSIDE, CAME OUT 5 MINUTES LATER AND IT HAD MOVED ABOUT 5 DEGREES MORE TO THE WEST, EVEN LOWER ON THE HORIZON RIGHT ABOVE THE TREES.  AT THAT TIME IT STARTED TO BLINK OUT PERIODICALLY, REAPPEARING IN THE SAME PLACE.  AFTER DOING THIS ANOTHER 10 MINUTES OR SO, IT WENT OUT AND NEVER REAPPEARED.  ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT OBJECTS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE NIGHT SKY.  IT WAS BRIGHTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE SKY, AND CAN ASSURE YOU IT WAS NO KIND OF AIRCRAFT.  IT WAS COMPLETELY SILENT! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witnesses probably were looking at Venus, which is in the western sky, currently.
