Two nights in a row I have observed some unidentified crafts. The lights seem to pulsate and shimmery lights.  Color varies, red, bluish green and that bright bluish white like some of the new cars have today. The crafts seemed to hover over an area and occasionally there seemed to be lightening happening last night but tonight the appearance was different it was almost like ripples of lightening. I saw the crafts that seem to hover several nights now but tonight is the third night in a row that I have witnessed the crafts.  Funny thing was that at 2 am the rooster began to crow and tonight the cows were mooing and almost moaning as well ... quite unusual it seems for the animals to be making any commotion like that during the wee hours of the night. I have seen these crafts over a few year period now but never for so many nights in a row like the past three nights.  The crafts seem to move so slow that if there weren't trees as a guide to their movements you would not really realize they had moved at all!!!   So strange for our community to witness such strange things!;36.2322;-80.6313
