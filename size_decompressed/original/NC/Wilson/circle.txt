Unusual ball of light flashed in the sky;2006-05-20 00:05:00;1-2 minutes;Unusual ball of light flashed in the sky When I stepped outside to smoke cig I saw helicopter in distance so I went to edge of porch to look at it flying by. After it went further away I saw bright blue/white flash with pale green around it above our house for split second but I couldn't get better look at it. About 30 seconds later I saw 2nd flash and tried to take better look at it this time. It look like some kind of ball of lighting but it's not very bright. It look strange because I never see anything like that before. I don't know if it's UFO or something else but I decided to report it anyway.;35.7342431034482;-77.9305896551727
Star shaped light blinking and rotating - then two of same lights after cloud went over and began to move;2008-10-01 20:00:00;10 minutes;Star shaped light blinking and rotating - then two of same lights after cloud went over and began to move Last evening, October 1, 2008, at approximately 8:00 p.m. I was walking my dog in the Country Club area of Wilson, NC (40 miles east of Raleigh, NC).  The sky was semi-clear with a few occasional clouds.  As I  looked up a saw a light hovering – not overhead – but in front of me, probably about the height of a airplane midway down to landing.   The thing that caught my attention was that this light wasn’t moving – it literally was hovering.  As I walked along and got focused on the light it looked like a star-shaped light (individual lights in the shape) at the bottom that were blinking/rotating.  I thought it was odd as I have never in my 52 years seen something in the sky that resembled this kind of light.  After a few minutes of staring at this light a cloud went over it.  When the light reappeared it then looked like there were two sets of star-shaped lights that were blinking and rotating.  After the second set of lights appeared the object began to move southward in the sky at a much greater rate than I have ever seen an airplane.  I watched it for a minute or so and then the lights disappeared.  I telephoned the non-emergency 911 number but was told no one else had reported seeing this light.  I am sending in this report just because I know this was not an airplane.  I have Googled all morning what kind of object would have this type of lighting on the bottom but all I have come up with are unidentified flying objects - -;35.7342431034482;-77.9305896551727
several unidentified objects where seen on this day from my home in Wilson, NC;2011-01-09 11:40:00;3-4 seconds;Several unidentified objects where seen on this day from my home in Wilson, NC On Sunday, January 09, 2011 at about 11:40 am, I was lying on my bed which faces a window in my bedroom, and from my bedroom window, a series of very bright lights caught my attention. I immediately looked out of the window and observed approximately 30-40 circular shapes in the sky with bright lights. I was the only person to my knowledge that saw this and I immediately called 911, they gave me a number to the FAA 1-866-835-5322, to no avail.  I had someone go online and found this site. There was no noise, just the lights they were extremely bright.  Just as quick as I saw them, they went away…  I am not crazy!  I know what I saw. Thank you  Mrs. ((name deleted));35.7342431034482;-77.9305896551727
Plane chasing a bright star like craft, very fast.  I have it on video.;2012-08-01 20:00:00;20 minutes;plane chaseing a bright star like craft, very fast. I have it on video. Thank you for reading this. I have been watching these things for some time and several times a month. One  even  landed a few miles down the road. After following it to a dirt path and as I came to the end where it was at there was a gate that said it was an  animal reserve.  I have lived here my whole life and never heard of that being there.  The other I got on tape with a jet following it but was left behind after the object went to fast for the jet to keep up with it.  It was as bright as a star and sometimes it seems to get as bright as the sun.  It is so bright and fast.  If the sky is right you can see a tail of smoke from it when it goes fastest.  I have it in the day time on video also of the jet behind it.;35.7342431034482;-77.9305896551727
Orange Lights Over Wilson, NC.;2014-07-12 22:30:00;10 minutes;Orange Lights Over Wilson NC First caught our attention as we driving.  3 to 4 round orange objects, bright glowing, in the sky just above the tree line floating slowly off in the distance.   We pull over to see what it was thinking maybe floating lanterns or some other type of glowing device.  However they were glowing to bright and began to move off together at the same time in the same direction.   Then, more objects appeared afterwards same color and circular and swiftly moved off maybe an additional 3 to 4.   Then and additional 2 came out and quickly move off.    We tried to follow but could not keep up and the vanished quickly.   Duration of the event was short maybe 5 to 10 minutes.   We are not sure what we have witnessed have tried our best to logically explain it but have no explanation.   Also to note the objects sometimes were a bright white then went to a light orange to to bright orange, no sound was ever emitted.;35.7342431034482;-77.9305896551727
