My girlfriend and I were going home from an event and as we arrived home we noticed a object in the sky. We first thought it may have been a blimp but the more we watched this object move we knew it was not. This object moved slow at times then fast with sudden stops and would hover for a few seconds then move out of sight then back again. The object was for the most part dark but it was a clear night and we could see the object clearly against the night sky. I would say that it was no more than 500 yards away during the time we saw it. It most surely had a metalic look to it but not very shiney. We watched this for a good two minutes or so and as fast as it came it was gone. The object to me looked to be more of a tube shape like a paper towel roll. This left both of us speachless for several minutes. We live in a small city but at that time of night there were few people out. We were in a well lit parking area and our front yard at the time of the sighting. My friend who was visiting from out of state also witnessed this but for only a few seconds as he arrived at our apartment after we did. He was awstruck with the object and had many questions but we were just as puzzled. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
