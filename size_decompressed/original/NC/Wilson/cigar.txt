We tracked a large cigar shaped object accross town until it went out of view over the treeline.;2002-12-08 21:00:00;30 minutes;We tracked a large cigar shaped object accross town until it went out of view over the treeline. As we exited off the highway to go into the city, I spotted the big, bright light in the sky. It was straight ahead of us about 150 feet off the ground and about 2 miles away. The sky was thinly veiled in clouds, the crescent moon and some stars still visible behind them. The light we saw was almost as large as the crescent moon and almost as bright.It was on the underside of the clouds, and was clearly visible. It was a cigar shape and moved with as we drove into the city. We were traveling at 60 mph. and as the object flew with us, covered a much greater distance in the same time. I would guess it traveled about 150 mph. We got caught at what seemed like every stop light trying to follow the light as it passed over the town and away toward the next town. We kept up the best we could and finally lost sight of it as it disapeared over the tree line about 5 miles away. At this point, we were way out in the country and no roads lead in the direction the object flew. Just farm and swampland. The object must have been of huge dimensions as we could tell it was always at least a couple miles away for most of the chase, but was still as big as moon. I tried to call the local airport to see if they had any anomolous aircraft on radar, but no one answered the phone.;35.7342431034482;-77.9305896551727
2 dark cigar shaped objects in night sky;2007-04-30 23:00:00;10 minutes;2 dark cigar shaped objects in night sky We were driving home from the store when we saw them.  There were 2 that we could see.  There were no lights, just dark shapes.  We have an almost full moon right now and you could see their profile near the moon.  We slowed down and watched them all the way down the road.  They didn't seem to be moving. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

White, pill shaped, silent, wingless aircraft  glided from north to south across the horizon in full daylight.;2016-08-26 07:00:00;5 minutes;I went out for my morning cigarette and walk, when I noticed White, pill shaped, silent, wingless aircraft  glided from north to south across the horizon in full daylight.  It was the only aircraft in the sky.  No lights or anything was coming from the craft.  It was flying about as high as a helicopter would fly, but it completely and absolutely silent.  No erratic movement was noted.  I wanted to run back into the house to photograph it, but I didn't want to miss it.;35.7342431034482;-77.9305896551727
