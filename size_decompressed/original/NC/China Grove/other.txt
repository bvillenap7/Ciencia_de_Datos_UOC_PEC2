Saw something silver explode leaving a silver trail.;2012-05-17 22:00:00;2 minutes;Saw something silver explode leaving a silver trail. On May 17th most likely around 9:30 or 10:30pm I was on the phone with my boyfriend on my back porch. Suddenly there was a sort of bright silver explosion in the sky above where I was looking, so I didn’t get the greatest look at it as soon as it happened, just a glimpse.  There was no sound just the flash of the explosion and for about 25 seconds there was a bright silver line hanging in the sky and it slowly faded away. For a second I thought it looked like a telephone line with moonlight reflecting off of it. That’s the best I can describe it I guess. I thought it was a UFO because A: I have never seen anything like that before. B: it COULD have been a comet but I have seen a comet go by before and it looked nothing like that. And C: because it reminded me of in a sci-fi movie when a UFO goes warp speed or something and disappears leaving a silver trail that fades away.;35.5703;-80.596
