V-shaped lights over NC.;2015-04-22 21:20:00;1-2 minutes;V shaped lights over NC About 9:15 on April 22, 2015 I was sitting outside on patio watching a plane going south to my left.  When above me appeared a very large v shaped light pattern.  The lights did not blink but we're round and pale yellow white color.  They seemed brighter around edges and paler in the middle.   There were 5 lights in tota, and it made no sound.  Compared to the plane, I had just seen it was massive in size.  It moved in a northerly direction quickly.   I went in the house to get my son, but it was gone by the time he came out.  I must have watched in disbelief for a minute or so before I went to get him.;34.3208000000002;-78.7144999999999
