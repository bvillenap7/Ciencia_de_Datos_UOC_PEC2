While in Whiteville, NC, on 701S I witnessed a ball of fire approximately the size of what a hot air balloon would look like a mile away, it appeared to have an engine trail behind it and it appeared to have landed in a field of trees to my left. It was at least a mile ahead of me at the time, I could not get a photo, it was much too fast, within 4-5 seconds it had disappeared into the trees.  I looked up into the sky to see if anything else was coming and there appeared to be hundreds of bright stars in the sky.;34.3208000000002;-78.7144999999999
