Then out of no where another light appears above them and they all seem to slowly drift in opposite directions, then two of the lights shot away, almost replicating a shooting star, while the third light slowly continues to near us, we all just stared into the sky in awe, still processing what we all had saw then suddenly the light is right over top of us then it disappears. Immediately after my 165 lbs Great Dane comes running to the house whining as if he had been attacked, doing everything in his power to get inside, once inside he wouldn’t stop trying to get under the bed in the spare bedroom, in the basement. From the time I first saw the lights to the point I let my dog inside over 2 hours had lapsed and none of u! s have any clue how.;36.1927;-81.0009
