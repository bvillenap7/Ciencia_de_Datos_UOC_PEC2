Large object seen in the air joined by other objects.;2003-12-27 17:30:00;20 minutes;Large object seen in the air joined by other objects. We were inside my grandmothers house when my uncle noticed something moving in the sky, we could see it thought the glass door. it was a rather large object moving south-east from here. it was white ball in the sky. as we watched it someone got some binoculars and we also noticed it was glowing redish orange. after a few minutes of watching we noticed that a small red ball shot fromt the underbelly of the craft. it sat underneath the larger object then shot out to the right at a high rate of speed. so fast that i couldnt keep track of were it had gone. then as that happened a second later 2 more smaller craft appeared above the large object.they dissappeared as quicly as they popped up. they looked about the same size as the object that came from the under neath of the larger object. then as we were watching the larger craft go out of sight from the mountains another small one popped up aain above us for a few seconds then left. we took some photos with our digital camera and only one sort of focast.  After that my wifes family called the local airport and asked if they were doing some sort of airshow or anything iof that nature. and they replied no. when the small object came apart from the large one it looked like it was firing a missle or something ..my first thought was we were going to war or something with some other country. then when the others started to pop up i was sort of scared of what was happening.;36.1927;-81.0009
