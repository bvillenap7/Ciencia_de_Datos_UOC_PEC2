very large triangular object with two very bright lights on the front and a reddish looking light on the bottom center;2001-03-26 21:35:00;10-12 minutes;very large triangular object with two very bright lights on the front and a reddish looking light on the bottom center As we approached an intersection we noticed 2 very bright lights up in the sky that looked like they were just sitting there.  One of my kids finally asked me what is that.  The only thing I could think of was that maybe they had put up some kind of tower because I knew it wasn't an airplane.  We continued to watch it just sitting there and then it began to move very slowly across the main roadway to the other side and began to hover again.  As we got closer to where it was we looked up at it and noticed a strange triangular shape with a redish light in the bottom of the center of it.  It began moving again very slowly and then turned and moved back across the main roadway toward the side we had first seen it then it suddenly just disappeared.  We turned around to go see if we could see where it went to thinking maybe it went down below the tree line but it was gone.  Then as we approached near the hospital we looked over in the field and saw the two bright lights hovering there again.  As we observed it began to move slowly away again and looked like it was moving downward then it suddenly dissapeared again.  We rode around near both places we had seen it and could not find it anymore.  We never heard any type of sound coming from it.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
large triangular craft  with 5 lights1 a red blinking light,hovering until i arrived right next to it and slowly dissappeared;2008-04-21 23:30:00;3 to 4 min.;large triangular craft  with 5 lights1 a red blinking light,hovering until i arrived right next to it and slowly dissappeared This event took place on April 21, 2008. My buddy was taking me home that night it was about 11:30 pm driving down highway 70 between Raleigh and Durham. And coming around the bend there is a straight shot of about 2 miles of road to the intersection of page rd. and highway 70, so as soon as we go around this bend I see two really bright lights all the way down at the intersection that were noticeably brighter than any of the other lights around the area. And immediately my friend says “that’s a plane man” and I automatically agreed with him thinking it has to be… no way you know? As we got about half way down the road we noticed it hasn’t moved at all, so the next thing my friend says is that it has to be power line stand with lights or something and my reaction was were about to find out we are coming up on it now, we pass the power lines on the road which has no lights at all on it and then we pass about 300 feet of tall trees blocking the view and as we pulled up next to this craft immediately three other lights were now visible one of which was a blinking red light. It was a big black triangular object hovering completely stationary at least as long as 2 city buses together. It was only about 50 to 100 ft. over the trees, no sound completely silent no shine what so ever. I could see the angles of the craft through the light and could tell it was a three dimensional triangle about as tall as one story of a house. As soon as we stopped the car after taking a right on page rd. the craft started to move slowly away as if it had seen that we figured out what it was or as if there was some sort of intelligence looking back at us just steady slow cruising seemed to gain altitude and in a matter of seconds was totally gone, the lights we had seen two miles away had disappeared in a few seconds. See the thing is I got such a good look at this thing it is unbelievable, much less did I even believe in the phenomena but to be in the right place right time to even come in visual contact with one! blows m y mind. It looked like to me it was just sitting there watching the airport that has planes flying in and out all day but as it moved away I could tell that the blinking red light was on the back left corner cause of the direction of the leading point. I want to add that I have never been more scared in my life really my eyes were watering from shock I guess and I had goose bumps all over the place all night because of it. And other than that this is as far as I can go with it because its impossible to pursue further and half the people you actually tell your story to think you’re out of your mind but I don’t care we know exactly what we saw.And the reson i filled this out now i because it took my a while to be able to look at this site because of no internet.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Large triangular craft seen hovering over power lines;2009-04-20 00:00:00;about 5 mins;Large triangular craft seen hovering over power lines It was around midnight on April, 20th, 2009.  I was driving down the highway to bring a friend home when we both noticed a bright light about a mile or so up ahead, low to the ground.  As we continued to towards it, the light became brighter and still remained low to the ground.  My initial reaction was that it was a spotlight or a low helicopter or something.  As we drove up on the object, which was about 50 yards off to the side of the highway in a field with high power lines, we both stared in awe as we noticed a giant triangular shaped craft hovering above these power lines.  I was driving and my friend was in the passenger's seat, so he had a better view than I did.  I kept looking over at it every second or so and what I saw was a triangular shaped craft about 60-80 feet long on the longest parts and three bright yellowish/orange lights shining from each corner.  We took a right turn at the next light about 100 yards up the road and pulled right into a parkin! g lot next to this field.  We got out of the vehicle and stared in awe at this giant craft, not making a single sound, just hovering above the power lines.  As we stared at this craft, my friend gets in the car and pulls his camera out.  About this time the craft starts to slowly ascend into the air.  As he takes out his camera to take a picture, the camera reads, Memory Card Full.  He had just taken a pictures a few hours earlier of the night and had not filled up his card yet.  I found this to be very unusual.  As the crafted started to ascend, it rose in somewhat of a rocking motion, then in an instant, it pretty much disappeared from sight.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
7-8 orange objects forming a triangle and V shape. Stationary position for several minutes.;2014-01-18 18:20:00;15 minutes;7-8 orange objects forming a triangle and V shape. Stationary position for several minutes. There were around 7-8 orange objects, which at first formed a large V shape.  They stayed in the same spot not moving for around 2 minutes.  I went to go get a friend to come verify what I was seeing and when we got back there was nothing.  After another 20 seconds or so 3 objects reappeared in the same area forming a triangle.  They stayed there for another couple of minutes before disappearing.  We both took pictures and agreed it was definitely a UFO.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Triangle craft.;2016-01-21 18:24:00;20 seconds;Triangle craft I was standing on my porch talking on my cell phone when i spotted 3 lights in a triangle formation fly directly in front of my house.  It sounded like a distant rumble.    I quickly got my wife's attention and she was able to snap 2 photos before it flew out of view.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Two sets of lights in isosceles triangular formation flew slowly over a gas station.;2019-10-05 15:30:00;1 minute;Two sets of lights in isosceles triangular formation flew slowly over a gas station. Two sets of lights, each in isosceles triangular formation flew very slowly over a gas station in Durham, NC.  This was across the street from Planet Fitness on MLK.  I was just across the street.  I wondered if it was a medium sized airplane with all lights turned off and the wings lit up, but that makes no sense.  The lights were not normal airplane lights in any way.  Also the lights moved very slowly and were only about 50 feet above the gas station.  After about 45 seconds the lights disappeared behind some trees.  I do not believe in UFOs but don’t know how to explain this.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
