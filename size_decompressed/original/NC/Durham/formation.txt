This occured approximately 6 miles Northwest of Raleigh-Durham (RDU) airport.   The engine noise emitted was a low rumble, unlike that made by any airplane or helicopter I have ever heard.   There were inconsistencies in the placement of the lights yet they all moved in a very slow but consistent fashion.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
