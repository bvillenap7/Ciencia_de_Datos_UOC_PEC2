Near RDU airport, while driving, I saw something cone/teardrop shaped and on fire falling from the sky.  It disappeared behind the trees in the distance.  I thought a small plane was crashing, but it was way too small for that.  My son thought it might be a meteor.  I even opened my window to try and hear or smell something.  I've never seen anything like it.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
