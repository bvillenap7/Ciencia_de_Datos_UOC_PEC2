White orb over I-85 in Durham NC early 80’s.;1982-06-30 21:00:00;5 seconds;White orb over I-85 in Durham NC early 80’s I was a kid, and witnessed an orb like light over I-85 while traveling with family.  It was white. This was the early 1980’s so I was about 9 years old.  They didn’t see it but I was a kid and looking straight up into the sky.  It moved faster than I can explain. Nothing I have seen since to compare it too. It zoomed over the highway. Then came to a dead stop, about several hundred feet above the hwy.  within seconds it zoomed back off into the sky going upwards.  There was no sound.  Have never forgotten this moment.  I knew it was something out of the ordinary.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
A strange object moving at warp speed in the day;1995-06-01 15:00:00;10 secs;A strange object moving at warp speed in the day What I saw was a circle shaped object off in the distance in the middle of the day. The only thing that caught my eye was a slight glare off of the silver/metal look it had. It then started to move at what seemed to be warp speed, first up then left  in what seemed to be in less than a blink of an eye, I lost sight for a second then the glare caught my attention and when I looked at it again it seemed to skip across the sky to my far right and then it vanished just as fast as it appeared. What I thought was strange is the movements made were very elusive only up, down, left, and right and even more it  never  sat still for long almost as if it knew it was being watched. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667

As it reached its pinnacle it began to decrease in size and brightness until it disapeared. It remained stationary for the full duration. Astromnomical event? ((NUFORC Note:  Ordinarily, NUFORC would assume that a sighting report of this nature would have been caused by the characteristic flash caused by the Sun's reflection off the solar collectors of an Iridium satellite.  However, if the light was, in fact, stationary, the event was not due to an Iridium flash.));35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Round Silver Object Seen In Durham, NC Following an Airplane and Then Flying in a New Direction and Disappearing.;2013-01-18 16:00:00;2-3 minutes;Round Silver Object Seen In Durham, NC Following an Airplane and Then Flying in a New Direction and Disappearing Around 4:00 pm January 18th on Friday afternoon in South Durham North Carolina on the &quotThird Fork Creek Trail&quot in the direction of the setting Sun (West) I looked up and I saw a airplane with a small comtrail heading East (away from the sun) and something else very peculiar was very close to it almost riding next to it without a comtrail. I thought that it looked very strange and was way too close to the airplane for comfort.  The other object appeared to be round and smaller than the plane. Both were moving east, almost paralleled one another and very close it appeared both moving upwards and East. I fumbled with my cell phone camera to try to get a picture and by that time the object split off from the plane and went in a new direction. It was now moving in a horizontal line, where it was headed vertically before with the plane.  I do not have details if it was a exact angle or how this happened but it was then heading in a straight line to the right, due North I believe. So the object is now moving in a different direction from the plane and it looked like it was moving much quicker than the airplane now but not so fast that it was completely unable to track. So I followed it with my eye for a few minutes and the sun illuminated it for about 10 seconds and then it got out of the sun's illumination.  So basically it is a round, silvery gray object moving in a straight line now. I noticed that it had a bit darker silver dome and a brighter silver underbelly and it was not the shape of an airplane.  I say dome because it was not elongated like a plane, it was more round. I followed it for a while and I knew it was too high up in the sky to get a cell phone image it was just too high!  I also did not want to take my eyes off it!  It was heading directly to the right, in a straight line and then it just vanished right before my eyes.  The odd thing is I had a feeling that it was going to vanish. I don't know how I knew this.  It's almost like a sense that it was going to vanish.  After it was gone I could still see the plane I originally saw and how the other object looked absolutely nothing like it. The weather that day was completely clear, crisp 40 degrees and sunny winter day without a cloud in the sky.  The other planes in the sky all had little comtrails and did not just vanish.  This other craft? definitely stood out as being bizarre...which is why I am writing this. I spoke into my phone and got all these details down as soon as it happened so things would not fade and get jumbled in my mind.  I hope this report is useful, maybe someone out there saw it too or there is an explanation.  It seemed different that just another plane.  Something unusual about it, which motivated me to write my first ever UFO report.  No one else was on the trail at that moment.  It was like just me and this thing and I was mesmerized just watching it.  It was actually a pretty incredible feeling and I am glad I witnessed it.

Bright flashing white ball in broad daylight;2013-11-04 12:30:00;2-3 minutes;Bright flashing white ball in broad daylight Around lunch time on a job site in Durham, NC, several co-workers & I looked up to see a bright circular white light in the sky.  It was a very blue sky crisp clear day, almost no clouds. It lasted for 2 to 3 minutes & mostly stayed in one spot only drifting to the right very slightly. It seemed very big as we saw other planes cross the same area throughout the day & ones that were lower to the ground you could make out in good detail.  So we do not believe there was any mistaking this ball of light for a plane or anything else. Every 8-10 seconds the light would either blink out & disappear instantly then blink back in or fade to smaller then blink out completely then a couple seconds later blink right back into view.  2-3 minutes of this fading/blinking in & out & after the last disappearance it didn't come back, it just seemed to vanish & we didn't see it anymore that day.  It almost seemed like a solid object but it was so bright white it was hard to decipher any distinct edges.   On examination of video that we took, to the lower right side of the object there seemed to be a much smaller round object floating with it & zoomed out along with it as it disappeared.  But was not visible throughout the entire video, just a few second here & there. ((NUFORC Note:  Video shows a white colored object appearing, and then disappearing, as the witness indicates above.  We will inquire whether he might have been photographing through a plate of glass, and therefore, whether the light might be a reflection.  PD));35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Multiple white circular objects at high altitude appear suddenly, cluster in a group and then disappear.;2015-01-19 11:45:00;2 minutes;Multiple white circular objects at high altitude appear suddenly, cluster in a group and then disappear. While standing outside watching intermittent local airplane traffic I noticed three or so objects directly overhead and very high in the sky, beyond commercial jet altitudes.   The day was clear, sunny and cloudless, and no planes were in the vicinity at the time of the sighting.   The objects were circular in shape but not spherical, dime-sized and white in color, emitting no noticeable light.  They did not fly into view from a particular direction but rather just appeared in the area of sky I happened to be watching.   For approximately 15 to 20 seconds they were moving in a general area relative to one another, then seemed to cluster into a tighter group.   Immediately after that, 2 or 3 more objects appeared within the group.  This lasted maybe 10 or 15 seconds before 2 or 3 more appeared within the group making the total number of objects 8 or so.  They remained in this cluster for another 30 seconds before seeming to vanish with no discernible movement in an! y direction.   The entire sighting lasted roughly 2 minutes.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Bright silver shape circle.;2017-05-08 10:30:00;5 minutes;Bright silver shape circle. On this date I was driving from downtown Durham to hwy 85.  I stop at a stoplight and saw a  bright sliver shape circle and thought maybe it was just a plane.  I turn away for a second and the object was gone.   I thought maybe it flew behind some trees but there was no trees in the area an not a cloud in the sky.  At this point I realize I just saw a UFO,  I drove off and still could not see the object.

It was going in a right direction glowing faint until it started to move to the left, which the it started to glow a lot brighter and grew half it size.  It made no sound.   The temperature outside is cool and there is no sign of clouds or electrical storms.   The object kept moving back and forth  (to the left and right) for several minutes until it slowly faded out.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
