(my portion);aprox. 8:40 EST, white flame shape heading fast for ground,  turned 90 degree then looked like short white line It looked like a white flame in the sky moving straight toward and ground.  It had no jet trail lines showing the path it had taken.  I made a rather sharp (~90 turn) and when it did it no longer looked like a white flame.  It was like I was seeing it in profile at this point because it was a line similar to the look of a white trail that jets leave.  Yet it was only as long as the width of my finger when I held my finger up to the sky.  It was moving very quickly.  And then as we were driving the tree line obscured it and I could no longer see where it was going.  At first I was afraid it was a bomb or missle yet it did that 90 degree turn.  I saw it as about 8:40 eastern standard time.  It was a cloudless clear sky.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Blue-white fire ball over Durham;2009-12-29 20:50:00;5 seconds;Blue-white fire ball over Durham Driving home on Hwy 147 towards Hillsborough, saw a large blue-white falling ball with a blue-white tail 2 1/2 times as large as object out of passenger side window.  Looked like it could be a comet, but color was wrong.  It looked close by, falling towards earth then it was gone.  It appeared to be about 1/4 mile away.   Went home thinking I would see somthing about it on the news, because many people were sure to have seen it.  Nothing was ever mentioned about it.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
