Big as a house & made no sound;1981-05-20 22:00:00;5 MINUTES;Big as a house & made no sound It occured in far north Durham county, after leaving some friends @ a closed down old race track late @ night. They made a left & I made a right, after traveling only a short distance, maybe 3-5 miles I noticed the object to my north moving very slowly & horizontaly. To my right was a large pasture surounded by tall pine trees, the road was a small 2 lane black top. It moved from the north traveling south where it passed over the road approx. 1/8 of a mile ahead of me. It was pitch black & no around but me, it was so bright my head lights were washed out & lit up my entire car & about the size of a split level home. There was absolutely no sound, I watched it move off to the south & out of sight. For a few mintues I sat in my car wondering what I had just seen, but to this day I have no idea. I work in the aviation field & I've never encountered an aircraft that is completely silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
sphere of white light follows plane, then disappears into the night sky;2004-05-27 22:15:00;3 minutes;sphere of white light follows plane, then disappears into the night sky I'm typing this 2 hours after the sighting. At 10:15PM, my neighbor, his wife, and I observed an airplane being followed by a sphere of white light. What caught my eye were two lights in the sky, traveling close together. Upon further inspection, I saw that the lead craft was an airplane, as there were flashing beacons on the wing tips. It was flying towards us. We do live close to the RDU airport. There was a craft behind it, following closely. However, there were no beacon lights on it. It was a completely round, spherical white light. The airplane turned left and the sphere followed it. Now going to our right, approximately 10 seconds since the plane turned, the sphere of white light disappeared. We watched the plane for about 3 minutes until it hit the horizon, where we could not see it anymore. There were no clouds. It was a clear night. The Big Dipper was right above us. We did not see the sphere after that. This was really weird.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Rapidly descending sparking fireball, seen over the course of several seconds;2014-11-03 18:20:00;5-6 seconds;Rapidly descending sparking fireball, seen over the course of several seconds Driving home.  Looking into the west/northwest sky.  It was dark already,   I saw a rapidly descending object spherical in shape--it was yellow/orange and shot sparks 3-4 separate times as it was descending--then I lost sight of the object.   I was almost certain that something would have crashed or fallen from the sky and it would be on the news.  I have seen nothing.   Other drivers on NC-147N seemed to see it too and hit their breaks-not finding any reports on the news or anything though.   It was definitely different from any meteor shower/aircraft/shooting star that I've observed before.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Fast moving sphere of light.;2017-12-11 23:00:00;3 seconds;Fast moving sphere of light. Large bright ball of white light in North sky, low in sky, very fast- thought was meteor but seemed so big and close- not sure as I saw out corner of my eye and it was very quick and silent.

Watching sky for planes, as I often see.  No stars were visible and there were no planes - the clouds thick.  I saw a stationary light;2020-10-16 01:05:00;30 minutes;Watching sky for planes, as I often see.  No stars were visible and there were no planes - the clouds thick.  I saw a stationary light but was not wearing glasses.  It then moved a few times in way that a plane cannot.  I could not judge the distance.  I was stunned and slowly reached for my phone without taking my eyes off of it.  It then seemed to disappear or move higher into the clouds.  I began flashing my phone's light and after a few seconds it returned.  I began recording.  It moved again and again, sometimes laterally and other times up and down into and out of the clouds. It disappeared and I stopped recording.  This happened a few times. I was able to record it in several videos including it appearing and disappearing completely.  Feeling the object was gone, I closed my window to review the video.  Once satisfied I had actually captured it, I returned to the window only to see it again - now in a different location.  As I opened the window, it di! sappeared again as if it was aware of me.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
