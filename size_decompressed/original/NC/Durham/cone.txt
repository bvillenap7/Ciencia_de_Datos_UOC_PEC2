A cone of light coming from the sky unlike anything I have ever seen.   ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD));2021-04-23 05:58:00;>5 minutes;A cone of light coming from the sky unlike anything I have ever seen. Immediately upon walking outside this morning, I saw a cone of light coming from the sky. The effect was as if there were hole in the sky and a light were shining through the hole. Very weird I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I did not see the actual craft, just the light emanating from it, as if from its bottom. I have no idea how long it had been there before I went outside. It did not appear while I was out it was already there. After several minutes--I don't know, maybe five or seven minutes--it started to move away very fast and then suddenly disappeared while I was fumbling for my phone to take a photo. I wish I had thought of that immediately but instead just watched it.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
