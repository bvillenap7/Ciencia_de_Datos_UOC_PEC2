The lights were bright and low to the ground.   They were solid lights, no blinking.   I turned away to reach for my cell phone to take a photo, and when I looked back at the glowing lights they started to disappear one by one until they were gone.   These could not have been airplanes, jets, or helicopters for I would have heard noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrects time to 6:45 p.m., or 1845 hrs.  We have changed the time above.
