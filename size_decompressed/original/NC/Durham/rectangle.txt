Silver almost translucent, object flying over Durham.;2015-07-20 12:34:00;2 minutes;Silver almost translucent, object flying over Durham. I  was driving down the highway when my boyfriend pointed out a silver, almost translucent, object in the sky.  It appeared rectangular in shape and was too low flying to have been an airplane, and granted that we are not close enough to the airport for it to have been a plane we are positive it wasn't.   My boyfriend continued observing the craft  while I had taken my eyes off it to switch lanes,it's during this 5 second period the craft disappeared completely.  He stated the craft simply vanished.  We were on open highway so there was no way we had lost sight of it and a plane could not simply disappear out of sight entirely in five seconds.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667

Saw group of seven to ten dark/black objects that darted across the sky at treetop level.  Moved quickly from sight.   I thought it might be a flock of large birds, but objects had hard lines â€“ rectangular plus more.  Very odd.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
