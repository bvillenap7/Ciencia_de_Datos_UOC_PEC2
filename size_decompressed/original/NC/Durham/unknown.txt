Two sightings on cold days (Durham, NC) and 1 on a hot day (Charlotte, NC) with a picture of one;2012-12-23 16:00:00;10-20 seconds;Two sightings on cold days (Durham, NC) and 1 on a hot day (Charlotte, NC) with a picture of one Technically, there were 2 witnesses to this event. I was walking my 2 year old son home from daycare, when I put him on my shoulders. It had literally felt like the windiest day NC had ever had. I would know, as I didn't have a car at the time, nor the years preceding and following this event. Whe walking my son through a nature trail, I just happened to look up...I saw a parallelogram-shape open in the clouds, as if a garage door lifted.I blinked several times and immediately stopped walking. The shape stood open for several more seconds, then closed from top to bottom, in perfectly straight lines from start to finish.  This was not the only sighting I've witnessed. I have a picture on an older phone of a second sun-like object in the sky in November of 2013. Both the sun and this bright object were hidden by the clouds that day, so many would easily overlook it driving by, especially with the road layout on Fayetteville st in Durham, NC. I was walking to work at Lowes on the southside of town around 18:00hrs. Once it was in view, I never saw it depart. As I entered Lowes, it was still there.  The final sighting was in September of 2015, near downtown Charlotte, NC. I was walking, again, to a bus stop just southwest of downtown. I seen at least 8 red lights, in the shape of the letter U, in the sky. The difference between the first to sightings was that they or it was maybe 200 yards from the ground this time. It held its position for at least 10 seconds, then one by one, the lights disappeared.This occurred around 14:00hrs.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667

Something caught my attention and it made me look up into the sky.  For a second, it looked like the light from the separate planes, moving in formation, at the exact same speed without any deviation in formation.  But, as I looked a little closer, it almost looked like there was a solid mass. There was no sound ... not even airplane sounds. As it passed by a a star (or maybe it was Venus?) it appeared to cover the view of the star.  This is when I became really convinced that I was not looking at 3 separate planes but, instead, a single and very large object. I then saw some kind of plane appear from the left of the unidentified object.  I could gauge any distance.  It may have just been a regular plane. The object moved forward and behind the tree line, leaving me unable to observe it.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
