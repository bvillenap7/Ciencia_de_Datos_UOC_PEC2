Bright Strobe Light, Higher than a cell phone tower.;2013-11-26 00:00:00;Still Flashing;Bright Strobe Light, Higher than a cell phone tower. There is a flashing light over in the field by Rolling View Marina.  Continuous bright super white flash.  Looks to be a cellphone tower, but it is way too tall and its not out in the clearing like a normal tower.   We have been here 30 years and know everything about the area and every event that goes on.  We are not sure what this is but we have never seen it before.   The dogs are freaking out! I do have a video.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Low flying, fast moving, red/white light disappears into thin air.;2014-05-02 22:30:00;3 seconds;Low flying, fast moving, red/white light disappears into thin air.   We were outside at a public mall in a public setting.  The object flew directly over a large group of people and disappeared over a store into the night sky, but was silent and lasted about 3 seconds.  The only people who saw it happened to be looking up at the sky at that moment.  It was very low, much lower than planes/aircraft usually fly and was completely silent.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
