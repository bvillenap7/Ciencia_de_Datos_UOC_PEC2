oddly blinking light with an irratic path goes east then circles to go north.;2005-06-15 23:00:00;30 sec;oddly blinking light with an irratic path goes east then circles to go north. Looking up, I saw a light, similar to a plane, flying at a very high speed. It did not go in a straight line(although almost a straight line), it's path seemed slightly irratic heading east. It went beyond the tree line where I think it made a circle and I saw it reappear heading north. It was blinking, but the light was blinking more on than off. I beleive it left a bit of a trail( half a centimeter), because of the high speed.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
3 bright lights over Durham;2009-10-28 19:45:00;3-4 minutes;3 bright lights over Durham I had just stepped out of my car in the parking lot of a restaurant. I glanced up into a very clear sky and was immediately stopped in my tracks by the sight of 2 stars approx. 3 finger widths apart, just below Cassiopiea. Being an avid sky watcher, I KNEW that those 2 stars did not belong there. I turned and walked about 5 steps back to my car, so as to brace myself against a stationary object to try and see if they moved. In the 2-3 seconds it took to walk that far, when I turned back to look at them, they had dimmed considerably, and were slowly moving, this time the 2 had become 3 points of light and were slowly moving together. They appeared to be extremely high up. No sound. I am positive they were not balloons, chinese lanterns, airplanes, satellites. No idea what they were. It was just amazing, seeing this show in the sky and knowing it was something unusual and out of the ordinary.

3 lights diagnal very close with the center light appearing the brightest.;2010-05-05 21:20:00;>20 minutes;3 lights diagnal very close with the center light appearing the brightest. A bright light sitting in the sky west of Durham. Has been seen in the past.  When looked at with the naked eye it appears as a bright light but when looked at with binoculars 3 small lights are seen diagnal with the middle light the brightest. When looked at with 16x zoom on camera the 3 lights appear blue and red tinted.  Because of the city lights it is hard to make out the object accompanied by the lights.  The object sits in place and has yet to vanish but vanished the previous sighting.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Red light stationary in sky for well over 15 minutes;2011-02-03 22:00:00;15;Red light stationary in sky for well over 15 minutes My wife and I came out from the parking lot after dinner and then stopped to try and film this thing.  It had no sound, a plane flew behind us which was drastically different than this red light in the sky. In the video, it has no color and is hard to make out exactly what it's doing.  We continued to watch it for at least 15 minutes before it started to &quotbounce&quot and then disappeared upwards.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Saw a light the size and color of the moon, but descending quickly.;2012-05-21 04:00:00;30 SECONDS;Saw a light the size and color of the moon, but descending quickly. I woke up at 2:30 a.m. EST and could not sleep.  I was laying in bed for some time completely awake when I looked out my window when a light appeared on a cloudy night.   At first I thought it was just the moon shining, but the object was moving.  I could see the white light object through the trees and it was descending downwards slowly.  I kept my eyes on it for about 30 seconds and then it went below the tree line.  I could not tell if this object was very far away or right beyond the trees, and when it went below the treeline and I could no longer see it, I did not hear any crashing sounds or any sound at all and it never reappeared.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667

As the lights slowed down they started to decrease in luminosity as if flying directly away from us. The whole phenomenon lasted about 120-140 seconds. WTF!???  I can't believe I just saw UFOs ... very eerie!!!!!!!  now at 10:34pm its raining.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Solid structure with red light flying low performing controlled maneuvers.;2013-11-22 17:30:00;10;Solid structure with red light flying low performing controlled maneuvers Me and a friend were sitting in my car when we seen an object with a red light rise into the air about 150 to 200 yards in front of us.  Our first thought was that it was a shiny red balloon but it rose straight up quickly maybe 500 ft in the air and just stopped suddenly and hung there.  Just a solid red light. Then it moved to the left a ways, then to the right.  It moved unlike anything I've ever seen before.  Changing speeds.  I cannot guess how big it was.  It wasn't very big, maybe the size of a car.  The light also changed to white, as if it had turned around and I was looking at a different side to it.   I got out the car to get a better look.  It went away from me and lowered seemingly to the ground about a quarter of a mile from where it was before, and it got there quickly. I could see the light go behind some trees in the distance.  I kept watching for it to rise again and it did.  It came back near the same area as before flying low and moving very deliberately and strict.   There was no noise and the area of the sighting is very busy.   There are busy intersections and many shops and strip malls.  I'm sure others had to have seen it.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
Bright red light performing maneuvers and landing.;2013-11-22 17:40:00;10 minutes;Bright red light performing maneuvers and landing (Addendum to earlier report)  Earlier I described my sighting of a strange red light that I saw today.  This light rose in the air about 200 yards in front of me and a friend while we were parked in my car facing NORTHWEST.  This was around 5:40 EST.  In a populated area with intersections, restaurants and bargain centers.  The sun had gone down but it wasn’t totally dark yet.  The object seemed to have structure but the light was all that could be seen. When it first caught our attention it was rising from at least 50ft from the ground.  As it rose slowly it seemed to come closer to us but mainly going straight up.  It elevated around 500-600 ft then it stops suddenly and at that point we both were puzzled because this wasn’t normal flight maneuvers for anything I’ve seen in the sky and this was so close.  There were no sounds coming from it.  Now that it’s closer it appeared to me there were actually two red lights instead of one but both were bright and bled into each other.  They were side by side but seemed to both be on one object.  I couldn’t make it out clearly, but it looked like above the lights there was structure. The object at that point seemed to slowly spin 180 degrees now showing white lights.  Then it moved to the left and right at different speeds stopping on a dime.  Very controlled and deliberate, as if showing off.  Not very fast, but too fast to start and stop, changing directions as it did.  Then, it shown red again and went away from us, we both got out of the car to get a better view and it lowered behind some trees maybe a quarter of a mile away.  I could see the red light looked to have landed in a clearing and out of view.  I kept looking and 45 seconds later it appeared again rising from the area it had lowered to.  It came back to the same area it was before in front of us.  It performed similar maneuvers again and moved very fast, up and down left and right.  Then it went away behind the trees again once more. I never saw it after that. The size is hard to estimate, maybe the size of a compact car.  The shape seemed saucer like but was not flat.  It moved in ways I’ve never seen before, very stable and strict.  It seemed to be controlled by intelligence.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667

First thought it was a string or airplanes, but they were perfectly in a line.  Then one light appeared, separate, much brighter than the others, white.  Drones?  Would have required extremely precise coordination.  No sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
