He began pulling on his leash trying to go back inside before he had done his business.  I then looked up and saw three very bright lights that were moving somewhat erratically, but always in a coordinated way.  I watched them for a minute or so until they suddenly shot off to the north at an unbelievable speed.  Then while I was watching to see if they would return I became aware of a very low frequency hum or perhaps it was more like an electrical hum  and I actually felt it more than I heard it.  I looked around but at first did not see anything.  Then I noticed a huge spot in the sky that appeared to be darker than the rest of the night time sky.  This black oval shaped spot moved very slowly across the sky directly above me moving from south to north.  There were no lights and other than the initial low frequency sound I heard it was completely silent.  This object was enormous and when it was directly above me blocked out about half of the visible night time sky.  I could not tell how far away it was but I got the impression that it was relatively close (perhaps several miles high).  I watched the thing until it was nearly out of sight before I remembered that I needed another witness.  I ran into the house and called for my wife to come outside.  But by the time she got to the yard it was so far away it was difficult to see. I called the local radio and TV station to see if anyone else had reported anything and they were unaware of any reports.

Object viewed over I-40 during daylight;2008-04-25 13:00:00;2 min;Object viewed over I-40 during daylight A friend and I were travelling on I-40 West during broad daylight.  We both noticed in the distance a small black oval moving erratically over the highway. We had the same reaction 'What is that?'. It seemed to sway back and forth across the interstate.  As we continued travelling, it was briefly blocked by overhead road signs.  When it came back into view, it was slightly larger and still black in color.  Within about 30 seconds, it seemed to make a quick 90 degree turn towards the North and appeared much larger in shape... it was very bright as if was metallic and the sun was reflecting from it.  As soon as it made it's turn, it very rapidly 'swooshed' downwards and flew off towards the North at a very fast pace.  It moved so quickly, we lost sight of it as it flew behind the treeline.;35.9899699503302;-78.8870916666667
