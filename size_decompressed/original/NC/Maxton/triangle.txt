Small triangle, or X, at low altitude, and sharp turn.;2016-05-09 22:10:00;10 seconds;Small triangle, or X, at low altitude, and sharp turn. Hi Peter,  While driving eastbound on US 74 (I-74) just north of Maxton, NC, I spotted a bluish light on some low altitude airborne object. It was traveling south and made a sharp turn to the north.  While it was turning I also saw a red light which seemed to be on the other wing. It then passed in front of us at low altitude.  It looked small and the altitude was only 200 ft or so.  I saw a plane type silhouette but my wife thought it was triangle.  I only saw it for 10 seconds. It did not look like a plane and the lights were not flashing.  I am not sure if it was a drone or something else. I am curious if you had any other reports.  This was on Monday May 9th, at 22:10. Also I was fascinated with a program I heard you on.  It was “Art Bell’s Somewhere in Time” replayed on Jan. 2, 2016.  The original show aired on 4/16/97 and you and Art were discussing increased security at USAF Command Center in Colorado, possibly due to a 25 mile long UFO observed by some satellites.  I could not find any follow up information.  Did anything come of this report?  Thanks;34.7335;-79.314
