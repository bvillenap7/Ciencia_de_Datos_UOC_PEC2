Floating Multicolored object spotted in N-NW Sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star, we wonder.  PD));2010-10-08 20:50:00;21:10;Floating Multicolored object spotted in N-NW Sky My wife took the dog outside for the end of day walk ~8:20PM.  During this event my wife spotted unusual lights in the N-NW sky.  She came in the house and got the binoculars to get a closer look. After a closer look she got my attention and I went to view the object. The object was stationary ~20 Degrees off of the horizon and in view above a nearby tree. The object appeared to be floating in the distance.  The size of the object appeared to be about the size of a planet but the lights and motion are unlike any object that weâ€™ve witnessed. The motion of the was very slight but was somewhat stationary for 8-10 minutes where its relative position moved very little in perspective using the tree as a reference point. The lights were intense and primarily were white, red, green and blue.  When viewed through the binoculars the lights appeared to rotate.  No blinking but rotating on the object. After 10 minutes the object slowly moved out of view into the branches.   I moved to the front yard and continued to find the object through the branches until it was finally obstructed from view ~9:20P. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star, we wonder.
