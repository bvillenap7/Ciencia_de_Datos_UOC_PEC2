Glowing yellow sphere seen around midnight;2006-12-02 00:00:00;30-45 seconds;Glowing yellow sphere seen around midnight Note: I have already filed a report on a yellow sphere seen the day after Thanksgiving, I erroneously labeled it as a fireball, so i request that the powers that be change that for me.  Thank you.  Traveling through Mills River from a concert in Charlotte, a friend and I spotted a large, glowing, yellow sphere coming out of the Blue Ridge Mountains ahead of us.  I had seen a similar (if not, the same) sphere a few weeks prior.  Although the sphere was glowing yellow, it did not illuminate any of the mountains around it.  The sphere appeared to be roughly 1-1/2 miles in diameter, and was about 10-15 miles ahead of us. We both watched it, until (just like the first time i saw it), we came around a curve, and it had disappeared.  Both of the spheres i saw occurred over the same mountain range in North Carolina, and both appeared and disappeared in roughly the same amount of time.  I do not know the name of the mountain range where i saw the object  I have already reported the first sighting of the sphere.;35.3855;-82.5486
