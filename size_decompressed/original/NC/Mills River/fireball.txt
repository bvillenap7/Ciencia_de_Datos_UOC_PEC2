Large, glowing, yellow sphere in Blue Ridge Mountains.;2006-11-24 10:00:00;30-45 seconds;Large, glowing, yellow sphere in Blue Ridge Mountains. On the way from Asheville to Brevard, in Mills river, I spotted a large, yellow, spherical light coming out of the Blue Ridge Mountains ahead.  The Sun was still rising on the right side of the vehicle, so both the yellow sphere of light and the sun were in view.  The object was roughly 10-15 miles ahead of me, and from that distance, it appeared slightly larger than the appearance of the Sun, so I would estimate it was about 1-1 1/2 miles in diameter.  I kept the object in sight until I went around a curve, then I lost sight of it.;35.3855;-82.5486
