unusual round orange lights;2009-10-08 21:00:00;21:03;unusual round orange lights AT Approx 9pm in the southeastern sky,my daughter and I witnessed very unusual lights. First one large orange ball appeared on horizon.One by one 4 more appeared.They were bright orange in color, as compared to the stars visable, which were yellow in color. These lights were larger than the visable planets.These lights appeared to be moving steadily north-ward.They were clustered together. The lights appeared much larger than the stars/planets visable. (skies were clear).The lights were only there for a few minutes.We saw no streaking light. One second they appeared. Then one by one they completely disappeared, like someone hit a light switch.They were silent,we heard the usual night sounds. I have no idea what they were. I have never before reported unusual lights.;33.9626;-78.4101
