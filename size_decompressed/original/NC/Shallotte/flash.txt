3 orange lights spotted.;2013-12-19 20:30:00;~5 seconds;3 Orange Lights Spotted We were traveling down Old Shallotte Road headed to Grissettown (Hwy 17) and just after we passed Old Shallotte Baptist Church, my husband and I saw 1 bright orange colored light in the sky towards the North.  It only lasted a few seconds and was gone.   He said, What was that?  I said, Maybe a falling star..?   Then suddenly as we were debating what it could be, 3 MORE appeared.  In a formation of a triangle, brightening up to a orangish/yellow light then disappearing one at a time.  They were in the same part of the sky as the 1st light appearing.   Then as we were turning onto 17 and heading North towards Shallotte, we saw on the right side of the car, IN the Sky, flashing white lights which continuously blinked over and over.   They stayed like that blinking for probably 5 minutes and did not move from where they were in the sky.;33.9626;-78.4101
