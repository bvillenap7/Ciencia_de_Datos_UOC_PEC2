large bright white, cigar shaped objected moving right to left while heading southeast on Old Halifax Road, near Bunn, NC;2007-01-24 12:10:00;5 min;large bright white, cigar shaped objected moving right to left while heading southeast on Old Halifax Road, near Bunn, NC while driving southeast at the intersection of Pearces Road and Old Halifax Road, I could not but help see a bright white cigar object ahead of me moving from right to left.  It was above the horizon and was very large.  Judging from how far away it was and how fast it moved across the sky, I believe it to be a large, bright white, cigar shaped object.   I am an ex-Coast Guardsman and have been trained to distinguish objects from normal aircraft.  This was not a plane nor any other flying machine I have ever seen.  I was leary in reporting it, but feel compelled to do so.;35.9613;-78.2481
