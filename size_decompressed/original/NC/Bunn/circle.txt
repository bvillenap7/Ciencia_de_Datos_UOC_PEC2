Orange ball of light in sky;2011-09-28 21:55:00;1 second;Orange ball of light in sky I witnessed what looked like an explosion in the sky.  I was facing NNE looking at the star Cirus when a saw a round orange ball of light that lasted only a second.  I waited for a sound thinking it was an explosion, but there was no sound.  The ball of light was a little south and east of Cirus.  There were no clouds in the sky.;35.9613;-78.2481
Sighted a bright white circular object move across the sky just north of the Moon.;2014-12-03 22:43:00;3 seconds;Sighted a bright white circular object move across the sky, just north of the Moon. I went outside to walk my dogs, and I was looking up at the moon.  There were clouds, but a large break in the clouds.   Then just north of the moon a bright white circular object moved across the sky at a high rate of speed.  It moved a lot faster than any aircraft can move, but not at fast as a meteor.   As it moved from east to west it got very bright for a second then kept moving at the previous brightness.  I contacted the local news department, and the local airport radar facility to see if any one else saw the sighting.;35.9613;-78.2481
