2 fireballs traveling across the sky;2012-10-20 19:30:00;5 minutes;2 fireballs traveling across the sky While attending an outdoor movie, my son pointed out an Orange fireball shaped object moving across the sky.  As an aviation enthusiast, it looked like nothing I had ever seen.  It also moved far too slowly to be a shooting star, which I also happened to see as we watched the object.  It moved in a straight line in a southerly direction at a moderate rate of speed.  We watched as it moved out of site. Almost as soon as it disappeared, another identical object appeared traveling at the same speed in the same direction.  This second object travelled about 3/4 of the distance as the first then disappeared. It had no flashing lights or beacons. It was a clear night.  There were several aircraft at various altitudes and distances.  They were all easily identifiable as aircraft and in no way resembled these objects. As I stated, this was an outdoor movie.  The objects were seen by my wife and myself as well as the couple we were with and our 3 children. 2 nine year old bo! ys and a seven year old girl.  I am unaware if anyone else attending the movie noticed the objects or not.  We tried to take a photo but it was taken by the other couple.  I don't know about the image quality but will ask if it's deemed relevent.;35.9613;-78.2481
