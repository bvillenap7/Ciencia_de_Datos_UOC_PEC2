Started moving along road for about 3 min At first thought it was a helicopter until the three lights I saw were rotating at a rate which a helicopter could not spin and move in one direction.  Slowed down as it got closer and could see a triangle shape wider than it was tall.  The rotating was independent of forward travel as in as it went faster or slower the rotation seemed to be constant.  TAs it turned around and went back the way it came from three helicopters appeared from Fort Bragg direction, one black helicopter and two attack copters, it was dark could not tell what kind.  This gave the final info for me that it was not heli's, because you could tell the difference.  I turned around and went home which is only about 5 miles from this point.  Got my wife to come outside and bring her telescope, we could not see it again, but the night was filled with the sound of auto cannon fire and machine gun fire.  We may be 40 miles from a base but there is no where around here where they can be shooting off ammo and not hurt someone.  I am a 100% disabled Navy electronics tech, who had a top secret clearence and worked for NASA in the Gulf in there oceano program, first tour in gulf during war I was Tactical Air Nav for Red Sea.  I have never seen anything like this, it scared me to actually see something I could not identify which was so out of the ordinary sceme of any craft I have seen, heard of, or dreamed of.  There are many people who sit outside between Hamlet, Ellerbee, Rockingham, and Mt Gilead and say they watch for UFO's, and see them frequently.;34.9346999999999;-79.7671999999998
