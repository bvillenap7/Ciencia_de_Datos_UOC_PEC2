Loud Humming sound;2019-11-20 11:00:00;4 hours;Loud Humming sound Loud Humming noise. Unbearable Humming noise lasting 2 to 4 hours everyday for the last several months.  It is so loud I am unable to sleep.  My boyfriend can hear it as well.  I reported it to the power company, thinking it may be a transporter.  It has gotten so loud that I am going to have to move.  It is a vibration as well.  I bought some ear plugs , but it only provides small amount of relief.  My boyfriend has put sound proofing on the walls but to no avail.;34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869
