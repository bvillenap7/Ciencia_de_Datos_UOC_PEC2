Last night after we put the girls to bed, my mother, sister and I went out on the front porch to have a cigarette,   While we we talking, we noticed a round shape in the sky moving faster than a normal plane or helicopter, around the right side and bottom of the glowing white, ball-like shape was a neon bluish, green light, the lights were squiggly, bottom one looked almost like a sideways S shape, the glow of the lines were very noticeable.  When asking each other what it could be, my mother said, SHHHH, listen to the engine, but could not hear the aircraft or whatver it was in the sky.   First time seeing anything like this.  Strange.;34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869
