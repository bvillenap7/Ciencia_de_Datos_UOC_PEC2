Black Chevron with no sound or lights;2005-04-03 11:30:00;5 seconds;Black Chevron with no sound or lights I just gone outside to smoke, and I always stare at the stars while outside at night.  This night was clear and calm, no really windy or anything.  It is too early in spring for there to be crickets or frogs or any other night noise.  Now I have lived in this area for 30 years and know what all the military planes, helicopters, stealth bombers and tilt rotors look like and sound like when flying.  I can just about tell you what is flying by the sound it makes without looking.  And this made no sound.  It was just sheer luck that I saw it when I did.  It was just this huge black chevron.  No lights, no sound, nothing.  Huge.  I couldn't even begin to describe how big it was or how high.  It was flying at about the height military planes fly when there is cloud cover and they have to fly low.  Except with military planes my windows usually rattle when they fly low.  But it was huge.  Bigger than anything I have ever seen flying.  And quite.  I just stood there and staired at it until it was out of my range because of trees.  Now I will be out there every night looking for this thing again.;34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869
Boomerang object with no sound seen in night sky;2008-12-29 20:05:00;30 - 45 sec;Boomerang object with no sound seen in night sky On 29 Dec 08 at about 20:05, I’ve noticed a brownish / tan object in the northeast night sky just above the tree tops.  The object at first was distorted but came into focus as it moved from the northeast to southwest.   As the object moved over my head, I noticed that it was in a shape of a boomerang with a light gray to dark silver color disc in the center.  The rest of the object was a light brown/tan.   As the object moved over head, there was no sound and it disappeared out of sight.   The object did not have an appearance of any military aircraft that I have seen.    I’ve called Marine Corps Air Station, New River to see if they seen anything on their radar and I was told no and was advised to call the County Sheriffs Office to see if any one reported seeing a UFO.  Again I was told no.;34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869
5 lights in pentagon formation moving extremely fast across sky.;2014-03-02 21:25:00;20 seconds;5 lights in pentagon formation moving extremely fast across sky. I witnessed 5 lights in a pentagon formation moving swiftly across the sky.   I live right across from the base in Jacksonville, NC.  I see many aircraft in the sky.  They all give off noise.  This object moved roughly 10 times faster than any craft I have seen before.   Didn't give off any noise at all.   I witnessed it for roughly 20 seconds till lost site of it.   Lights were not extremely bright, but object was solid, blocked out stars as it traveled across the sky moving from north to south.;34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869
