I am a LCPL. in the USMC. me and a buddy of mine were walking down the street from our hotel room to a liquor store.  We had not been drinking at the time our prior. hence why we were goin to the liquor store.  On the way there I happend to look up into the sky, and seen 5 or more balls of light.  moving in a way that would be impossible for any knowin man made aircraft. darting all over the sky and running into each other it seemed like.  my whole life i have been a skeptic of aliens, but after that, now im a believer. i didnt come sooner because i didnt think anyone would believe me.  but now i could care less if anyone believes me because i know what i saw.;34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869
