brigth light seen in sky above Jacksnville, NC;2004-05-14 22:30:00;5 minutes;brigth light seen in sky above Jacksnville, NC Stepping outside to have a cigarette with my stepfather, we were sitting on his deck talking and looking up at the sky... I'm used to seeing satellites and noticed a particularly bright one only after watching it travel in a straight line I noticed that it started moving in an s formation then more erratically... initially i thought it was an illusion because the wind was blowing, and the object was moving toward the top of two tall trees in his backyard after moving myself toward the houes and making sure it was not an illusion of the trees i remarked to my dad who also noted its movements which at this point became several small movements in the same general area like it was hovering and adjusting itself...we were facing north and the object was straight up above and a bit to the north the object was white and very bright, also it seemed at a very high altitude.. after watching this for about five minutes we agreed tht it was just us but before going back inside we noted that the object had all but vanished.. i feel that the object was all to hight to be a helicopter and moved like no other aircraft id ever seen...;34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869
Large wing shaped mother ship with over 80 small craft  formation;2007-03-13 21:30:00;1 hour;Large wing shaped mother ship with over 80 small craft  formation It was going on 9:30..im always looking in the sky at night and i finally seen what my wifes been talking about. This UFO appeared to be in space..it was very dim but very visible to the naked eye, it  appeared to be the mother ship for what was to come. The shape of the craft resembled that of a wing. It just lookied like a huge wing. judging by the distance it was at, i beileve this ufo was miles long. A 747 flys a 32,000 feet. This object was in space and completely dwarved what planes look like in the sky. It crossed the sky in about 15 seconds. Within an hour this ufo was seen twice. Also, with and without the mothership there were massive formations. They were in Formations resembeling the mothership. there were about 8 different goose like formations each consisting of 8 to 9 craft. to creat one massive formation. The awesome part was. When it was directly above us in the clearest part of the sky, you can actually see individual craft drifting in and out of formation. these formations crossed the entire sky south to north within 15 seconds. FYI My wife and i are completely aware of what airplanes look like, what stars look like, and what satilites look like in orbit. This incident consited of none of the above. This happens every single night. several times a night. Something is going on in the NC skys. i HIGHLY SUGGEST A PROFESSIONAL COME AND CHECK THIS OUT!..like i said..it happens everysingle night. I am far to lazy to make a report everyday. THIS should be taken seriosly.;34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869

When I looked at the picture and zoomed in I noticed a small saucer like object in the distance.   The object has something protruding from underneath it.  It is hard to make out in the photo, but at the time that I took the photo, there were no sounds of any aircraft around my house.  When I looked up again the craft was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Object appears to us to be an insect in flight, possibly a cicada.  PD));34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869
