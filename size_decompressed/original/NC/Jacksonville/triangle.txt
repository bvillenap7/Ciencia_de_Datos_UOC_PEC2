1 FLYING TRIANGLE  VERY  SLOW AND LOW THEM COMES BACK OR THERE WERE 2 OF THEM?;2005-10-23 19:40:00;2 min.;1 FLYING TRIANGLE  VERY  SLOW AND LOW THEM COMES BACK OR THERE WERE 2 OF THEM? I had just came back from checking in at the check in station on Camp Lejeune.  I was hunting deer.  I returned to my kill at aprox.1930 in the FA area in a 3/4 mile long field headlights on my deer I look up and see 4 lights comming towards me traveling in a SW direction.  This thing makes no noise as it comes to me them over me then I see flashing lights on the wing tips flashing red in the front or nose section.  As it is almost directly over me I can see a faint red lights with a large red light in a diamond shape glowing on the botton of this B2 shaped aircraft.I even flashed my flashlight at it because it appeared to be going so slow and had the altitude of an f-18 in the break or on aproach but it was bigger maybe by 20 feet but slower like helicopter speed.   But here is what baffles me as this thing gets about at a 45-degree angle away from me I hear a faint jet noise?  Now that means it was very high up and must have been very-very large or this is some new noise suppresion gear for turbo jet engines.15 minutes later it comes back or there were 2 of them!  Traveling the same flight path, but a few more lights in strange positions, 3 white lights right wing as it flys away on right leading edge area shining down and a few others strangly placed, but everything else was the same.Same craft or 2 of them I don't know. I'm and ((specialty deleted)) on ((type a/c deleted)) and now work on ((a/c deleted))    I've seen all aircraft fly,this was very strange.;34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869
Triangle UFO chased by osprees;2010-06-03 11:30:00;5 Minutes;Triangle UFO chased by osprees I was sitting in my car and saw a sphere just above the canopy of the trees.  The ball was gold and hung in the air.  It was coming towards my car but hovering as if it had seen me.  My street is a culdisac, I drove straight and drove through to the other end of the street.   The sphere was gone but directly in front of me I saw a triangle, at each point of the triangle was different balls of light.  One light was red.  The triangle tilted sideways and nose dived quickly into the woods.   I parked in my driveway and told my husband.  I went back outside and called a friend of mine who has interest in aliens as I was telling him I saw another light in the same area as the first light was.  I thought it was the ufo again and called my husband outside.   He said it was an ospree (military aircraft) 2 flew over head towards the direction of the ufo.  I think the ufo either landed or crashed.   I heard no noise from the ufo AT ALL but I did hear the noise of the planes I can tell the difference.  I think they were chasing it.   I want to know if anyone else has seen the type of ufo I have seen.;34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869
