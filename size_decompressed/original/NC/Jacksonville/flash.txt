This repeated two times an then off to the left of the five lights there was just a single flash of light but it wasn't anywhere near the other five.  We then went around a turn that the trees blocked the sky an when we got around the turn it was know where to be seen.  I know there are metor showers going on but metor's don't fall in a stright line an not like what i saw.  Being around a marine base you see alot of light's, flare's, an fireworks but i have lived here 7 years an never have i seen anything like what i saw.;34.7658883428569;-77.4024473142869
