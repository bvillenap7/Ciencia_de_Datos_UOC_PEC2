Circle of lights over BOONE, NC;2001-08-17 21:10:00;10 minutes;Circle of lights over BOONE, NC We were driving on 321 EAST (actually travelling North!) just south of ASU campus when I spotted it. A round craft with 5 large lights around the outside of it, blinking off and on in a cascading pattern, directly to the N less than a mile away. It was fairly large and round, I would guess about 100 feet across. Seemed to be hovering, but weather conditions had low cloud cover that was occasionally covering craft. I asked my wife and 13 year old son what's that?! and they proceeded to watch it while I drove. The ights just continued to blink off and on until we moved out of sight range of the craft.;36.218962765958;-81.6986631205674
