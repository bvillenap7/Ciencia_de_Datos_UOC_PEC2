Large red/orange object spotted over Boone, NC.;2011-10-21 19:25:00;10 seconds;Large red/orange object spotted over Boone, NC. This sighting shares almost the exact description as the object I reported on 10/21/2011 and both were spotted around the same time of night.   I was going for my normal run around the neighborhood.  I was nearing our driveway (around 19:25) when I saw the object above the tree line.  It was very large, red, and orange.   As soon as I spotted the object I realized that it was exactly like what I had reported on 10/21.   As I was running the object rotated to it's right.  As it did so the color changed from red to orange and faded away before my very eyes.   The entire sighting lasted no more than 10 seconds.;36.218962765958;-81.6986631205674
Black helicopters.;2016-06-08 10:23:00;20 seconds;Two unmarked, completely black helicopters flew directly over my head in single file, while I cutting the grass.  They were approximately 200 feet or less above my head, moving in a northwesterly direction.   There was a long spike on the front of the helicopter, perhaps ten feet in length, probably a gun of some type but I could not identify it.  No lights were noted.  I was unable to get a photo, unfortunately. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he affirmed that he did not witness what he felt might have been a genuine UFO.  He stated that he submitted the report, principally because the flight formation and ground track of the helicopters was something he had never seen before.  PD));36.218962765958;-81.6986631205674
