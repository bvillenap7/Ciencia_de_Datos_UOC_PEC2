Lots of mountain and wide mountain landscape. Around 50 to 70 objects spotted by me and then i told 2 of my closest friends who both saw what i saw. Never took my eyes off of them. very far away, but very large which gave the apperence that they were closer then they really were. they were flying in a V formation but it wasnt a perfect V the lines were staggered. All were SILVER in color and flashed due to the sun hit there metal bodies, so i was sure they were'nt sky divers. All the object appered to be round and moving at an extremly high rate of speed. They moved a couple of miles behind me (direction i dont recall) and started slowing down to a stop. Then the objects started a Vortex looking manuver, spinning around each other in an oblong ball vortex. The objects moved in and out of each other in a complex pattern for around 4 to 6 min. One by one the objects vanished (possibly moving away giving the allusion that they were vanishing). No Phisical evidence. no photos over video. But cameras were present. I cant deny what i saw. i am now a true UFO believer.;36.218962765958;-81.6986631205674
