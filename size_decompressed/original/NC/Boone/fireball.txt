Glowing Green light in Boone NC;2006-11-28 18:40:00;18-20 seconds;Glowing Green light in Boone NC While traveling 421North from Wilkes County NC to Boone NC, a friend and I witnessed a large, bright, green light with poorly defined edges rise from the mountain top to the left.  It rose slowly and appeared to be hovering or moving in the direction that the vehicle was.  It changed direction slowly and moved a short distance to the right and extremely rapidly moved into and above a cloud making the entire cloud glow green and it was no longer visible.  Of note, there was a major traffic accident at the bottom of the mountain but this in no way was a medivac or plane!  I'm well versed on both and can attest to this.;36.218962765958;-81.6986631205674
