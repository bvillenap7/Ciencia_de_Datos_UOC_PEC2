3 lights in moving triangle formation - changed formation to 3 lights in a row.;2001-07-15 23:00:00;30-40 sec.;3 lights in moving triangle formation - changed formation to 3 lights in a row. Clear summer night - dim white lights viewed standing at 3400â€™ mountain elevation in the near NC/Tenn. border. - very northwest Carolina - top of the mountain viewing position about 25 miles from the nearest town Saw what appeared to be three very tiny and faint lights cruising high speed in a triangle formation at altitude higher than most satellites -  as the lights traveled in a straight path - either the two rear lights sped up to form a three light row or the front light slowed to be in the center position row with the other two lights - I could not tell for sure how the formation change occurred as they were very faint and way, way up there - at that distance they were still moving fast enough for the whole event to last 30 seconds at the most to go out of viewing range.  The formation change appeared to happen at the same cruising speed and altitude (west to eastern)and with a consistent motion. Also, maybe a month later a very bright yellowish/white light appeared to hover still in clear night bluish sky and became brighter then dimmed and disappeared - this light was about the size of an oncoming motorcycle headlight - it was too bright to make out any shape with it  - this light remained stationary the entire event - happened about 3am at the same viewing location of the previous three lights - this light was positioned mid-horizon and seemed very close for about 5 seconds.
