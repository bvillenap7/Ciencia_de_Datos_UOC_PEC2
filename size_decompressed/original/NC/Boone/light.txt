Bright light appears still but leaves motion trail on digital camera;2009-07-26 03:30:00;several hours;Bright light appears still but leaves motion trail on digital camera I was just leaving a friend's house on a clear night when I noticed it. At first glance the object appeared to be a bright star or planet about SSW and about 30 degrees above the horizon, but after a second glance it was obvious it was much too bright. It was at least 10-20 times brighter than the north star. My friend came out and agreed it was definitely something unusual.  It didn't appear to move but after a few moments observing it I noticed it looked like it was flickering occasionally.  In order to get a closer look, I went inside as soon as I got home and grabbed my digital camera, only 1.3 megapixel and no optical zoom.  It didn't get me the close-up detail I was hoping for, but after I got inside and transferred the pictures to my computer I was astonished to discover that the object was in a completely different and seemingly random location in each one of the shots (about 10 in all) and it also left a significant light trail, or motion blur, in e! very shot. This was very surprising to me since the object APPEARED to stay in one spot when viewed with the naked eye.  Each one of the pictures is shot about 2-3 seconds apart.  My only explanation is that it is moving too fast for the human eye to detect which is why it APPEARS to be motionless, but the pictures prove otherwise.;36.218962765958;-81.6986631205674
Large red objected spotted in Boone, NC.;2011-10-21 20:00:00;30 Seconds;Large red objected spotted in Boone, NC. Around 7:30 Oct. 21 I went for a run around my neighborhood. It is dark enough at this hour to see the stars clearly.  We are in the mountains and are away from light pollution.  Near 8 pm I was jogging back in an attempt to return home when I noticed a very bright red object in the sky. It was perfectly still at this point.  At first I thought to myself that is one odd star.  Then the realization that that couldn't be a star hit me. It was far too low, blazing red, and brighter/larger than any star that I have ever seen. Just then the object moved down and went rushing off to the left behind some trees. It took me 5-8 seconds to run to the clearing. It had completely vanished. This was seen near the Deep Gap area.;36.218962765958;-81.6986631205674
Orbs of light behind clouds circling around each other.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights circling??  PD));2015-11-17 07:00:00;20 minutes;Orbs of light behind clouds circling around each other. Looking east, above the cloud layer were two - but at times three - orbs of light. They were about 45 degrees above the horizon and stayed within a small area in the sky.  The lights looked large but may have been enlarged due to the glare on the clouds.  The orbs would track over the area in either oval or figure-8 patterns, often circling around the other. The third orb would appear out of one but disappear soon after.  The motions were not uniform, although they were not erratic either.  It looked as though they would leave a sort of chem trail behind them, and the general area they were n cleared up of clouds - but not entirely.  Could not have been spotlights, the source of the light was above the layer of clouds.  A fire alarm was set off nearby in the direction of the orbs, not sure if EM related but worth mentioning.

Orbs of light behind clouds circling around eachother.;2015-11-17 19:00:00;>3 hours;Orbs of light behind clouds circling around eachother. THIS IS AN UPDATE TO A POST SUBMITTED AT APPROX. 19:30 ET. by myself.  ***update*** After seeing the objects described below I had to return to my studies inside. Approximately 2 hours later at roughly 9:15 PM the objects were still there in the sky. The only notable changes was that the area they were moving across had expanded substantially and that the sky was generally brighter in their vicinity. I also wanted to note the lights are BLUE in color - not the typical orange or red that is often reported with orbs of light. I have notified a few friends who are seeing the same thing but all are in the local vicinity.  We are all college students and seeing as it is a Tuesday night, no substances are in our bodies. We all agree that the phenomenon is almost mesmerizing. This is 100% genuine. I have a picture of the orbs from a smartphone that I will email to ufocntr@nwlink.com.  *prior post: Looking east, above the cloud layer were two - but at times three - orbs of light.
