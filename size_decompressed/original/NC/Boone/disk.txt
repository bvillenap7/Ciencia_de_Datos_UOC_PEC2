Three friends and I were camping out during a deer hunt. Our camp was situated on a mountain side that had been prepared by the wildlife service. It was graded out of the side of the mountain.   We were just finishing up dinner when one of the guys said, what is that and he pointed down in the valley toward the road.  He asked me if that was an airplane because I am a licenced pilot.  It looked exactly like a small plane trying to land with its landing light on.   All of a sudden it stopped and seemed to appear right in front of us about a mile away.  My distances are not going to be accurate.  It appeared to be about 500 feet above the ground which would make it just about even with us.   When it appeared there was no landing light but it was surrounded with round light that were very bright.  It seemed that the top lights were smaller in circumfrance than the bottom lights.  There was no definite shape to the craft but it appeared to be saucer shaped with a bubble shaped top.  It seemed alot like CE-1 Vallee:  I that is why I'm saying something about my sighting now after all these years.  What is a little curious is the fact that we waited for the object the next night and it appeared in exactly the same place but with no landing light, it just seemed to come from the northwest if i remember right and hovered for 30 minutes then left in the blink of an eye you might say.  We went down to where I thought it was hovering but found nothing. We left the same day.  I've never seen anything like it again but sure would like to, it was very exciting.
