Large red colored sphere descending on the horizon at approx 9:30 pm. Much larger than any plane lights. Appeared to fall into the back pasture, but nothing was there. Then approx. 2-3 minutes later when traveling in the car another large sphere was observed, again descending on the horizon. This sphere was a lighter color yellowish-orange. Both spheres disappearing onto the horizon. Weirdest thing I've ever seen in the sky.;35.2069;-78.1040999999998
