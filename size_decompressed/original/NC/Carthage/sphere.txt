Orange glowing object East of Moore County NC towards Fort Bragg.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from law enforcement officer.  PD));2012-07-06 21:40:00;2 minutes;Orange glowing object East of Moore County NC towards Fort Bragg I am a veteran law enforcement officer with over 12 years experience, so I know how to observe things.   While on my porch tonight I noticed a round orange glow towards the east, from 90 degree it flew straight and disappeared at around 150 degrees south east.  The object appeared to be approximately 400 feet high.  It made no sound.   The sky was partly cloudy, no rain, no lightning, very quite outside, I live in the country,   We have no ambient light that could have made such a reflection.  I star gaze almost nightly, but this time I had just stepped out to check on my sick dog and I noticed the object, it was moving at an approximate speed on 100 MPH, yes I ran radar for years and was damn good at estimating speed.   I was not drinking, tired, or anyway impaired when this occurred.   My 14 Year old, and friend also stepped out when I told them to come look at this.   It was a solid light, dull orange glow, it was about as large as a 30 to 40 foot circumference with no flashing, blinking, lights and made no change in shape or color during my observation.   There is a small airport nearby, but this was no plane or helicopter, it was no balloon or satellite I know, Im near fort bragg and it was going that way, if it was military its like nothing I have ever seen.
