Me and my mother were walking to the local store just as it was becoming dark.  When we were walking back she spotted a suspicious light that was very bright in the sky.  It wasn't moving at first but my mother was very suspicious of the way it looked.   As we got closer to home the object started to move without sound or blinking light, and as it was moving it started to fade away until it was no longer visible.   We were shocked and both agreed it was very strange and tried to come to reason with what it could be.   My theory is it may be some type of spy device that surveys an area and disguises itself as a star so it doesn't seem suspicious then when it moves it fades away so no one can see when it moves to another area to survey.;35.3742;-77.4173
