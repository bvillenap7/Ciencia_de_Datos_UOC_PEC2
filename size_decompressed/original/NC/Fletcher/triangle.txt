It had 3 lights in the triangle shape and a glow in the center of the craft. The craft was moving southeast. The craft looked the size of a jet airliner, but was much lower than an airliner. I looked outside because the wind was blowing real hard and I wanted to check to see if any trees had fell near our home. Then I seen it coming over the mountian and I went back inside to get my son up and he went outside on the back deck with me. He saw the object also, and we came back inside to notify you. I have seen other objects in the sky here. But this time, it was really large and bright!!!;35.4467000000001;-82.4977999999998
Triangular craft with lights on each vertice spotted silently hovering 30-40 feet above a field off I-26 East at exit 54 in Fletcher.;2014-04-22 21:17:00;20 seconds;Triangular craft with lights on each vertice spotted silently hovering 30-40 feet above a field off I-26 East at exit 54 in Fletcher. While traveling on I-26 East, right in view of exit 54--Mount Home and Fletcher, I witnessed a triangular craft hovering in the sky approximately 30-40 feet in the air over a field on the side of the interstate.   At first I believed the craft to be a plane, but, as I got closer to it, I realized that it was not the shape of a plane and that planes don't hover.   At each vertice of the triangular craft was a white light.  There was also a spotlight in the center of the craft, which was shining into the field.   I tried to film the craft with my camera phone, but couldn't get it focused correctly.  I did however, capture a short video in which the triangular object is in the frame for a second, then is gone (an issue mostly due to my driving).   I pulled over to the side of the interstate in order to capture a better video, but when I got out of my car, the craft (still hovering in the same spot) began to move slowly at first, then disappearing silently out! of sight.  The craft seemed to be fairly large, easily could have held 10+ people.;35.4467000000001;-82.4977999999998
