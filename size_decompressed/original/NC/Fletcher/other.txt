At first I thought it was something like a plastic bag floating, but it was very high up.  Then I noticed at least a dozen more.  So I thought it was maybe balloons or something released, but I could clearly see they looked a lot like bags.  Which is very possible, but I could also make out even smaller objects floating around the bags in what looked like circles.  Maybe those could have been little birds flying around a swarm of really big floating bags.  But the thing is, the bags were floating in the opposite direction of the clouds.  Everything was at least below the cloud layer today.  They didn't look like craft or anything, but it was really, really odd. It was like a huge swarm of these things just floating by with little things slowly orbiting around the big things. I figured, maybe if somebody else reports it, and has photos, you'd have more data about their path.  I didn't have my phone on me and I am not sure the camera would even capture them.  They were really high up.  I would not have noticed them had I not been laying down on a mat and looking up.;35.4467000000001;-82.4977999999998
