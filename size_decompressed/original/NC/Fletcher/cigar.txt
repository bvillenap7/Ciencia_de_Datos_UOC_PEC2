Cigar-Shaped object in small town of NC.;2005-06-15 16:30:00;2 Minutes;Cigar-Shaped object in small town of NC I was looking around at the sky with a friend, taking in a breath of fresh air when I noticed a Cigar-shaped object hovering in the sky a distance from us.   I nudged my friend on the armed and he looked and was amazed. I have good vision and I tried to get an accurate view of the craft before it simply dissappeared.  It looked to me like a US missle...but it wasn't since it was just hovering about...I'd guess a mile away from us. I called the local station, WLOS, and they reported no military operations were in progress.  We live near the airport...but it's only a regional one.  I called the airport and asked if any planes arrived that wern't on the schedule but the lady at ATC told me no.  It was not an airplane or a military rocket so I think the object was, indeed, a UFO.  The object seemed to be a greyish mattalic color, but then it kept changing from greyish to redish matallic...and some sort of haze seemed to surround it.  It wasn't too hot, so I don't think it was a mirage.   I stared at it almost in awe...and suddenly I heard a strange sound.  I can't really discribe it but it was like a WHOSHOP!...best word I could make for it.  My friend and I couldn't believe what we saw and so we decided to report this.  After that day I do firmly believe in UFO's. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate date of the event.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above, until we hear back from the witness.
