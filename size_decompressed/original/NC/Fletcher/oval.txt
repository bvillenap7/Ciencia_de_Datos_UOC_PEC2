Small Very Black Oval Moving Oddly At High Rate Of Speed Over Horizon;2006-01-04 17:20:00;35-45secs;Small Very Black Oval Moving Oddly At High Rate Of Speed Over Horizon I am a 13 year old female.  I have been tutored by ((two names deleted)) who are CoastToCoastAm paranormal investigators to observe and be skeptical while observing the world around me.  On January 4,2006 at around 5:20 pm I was watching the sunset (which was to the South-west) that was a beautiful purple-pink when I noticed a small black oval shaped object flying across the sunset. It took me half  a second to realize that it could not be a plane, than I started to yell at ((name deleted)) (who was with me) look, look. When he finally was able to see it, it was just a little past the sinking sun .The object was extremely black.  It absolutely reflected no sunlight and was amazingly dark and maintained this color throughout my observation.. In an instant after Dan realized what I was seeing he  ran  inside and told me to keep my eyes on it, so while he was gone I moved toward the other side of the yard to keep it in sight. all the time moving along the top most mountain ridge (in the direction of North-west) about 10-20 miles away over what I believe to have been following the Blue Ridge Parkway. The object carefully maintained a course to fly just above the top edges of the mountains peeking over Mt Pisgah. What stumped me most was that it was flying much too fast to be a conventional jet and it left absolutely no contrail at all. When ((name deleted)) got out of the house and handed me the binoculars the object had just gotten out of sight behind the far side of the sky from us. The whole sighting lasted about 30-35 seconds . When ((name deleted)) and I went back to ponder it he figured out that the object had been going about 8,000 m.p.h using google.earth, our location, and the duration of the sighting.;35.4467000000001;-82.4977999999998
