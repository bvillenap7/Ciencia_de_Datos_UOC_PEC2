I woke up in the night to take care of my toddler aged daughter.  When I went to her room I realized the interior of the house was lit up from this object, which was about 100 yards away. We lived in a small one story house on the edge of the campus across from the indoor swimming pool.  Land had been cleared next and behind this building for a new athletic complex. This object I saw was in the cleared area and I would say estimate the size of it to be the length of two bull dozers end to end.  There was no activity seen.  However, the luminous light would slowly dim and gradually get brighter.;35.3329147496613;-78.9192211096066
