Silver Cigar Shaped Object Seen;2008-07-13 19:00:00;1 minute;Silver Cigar Shaped Object Seen The sky was clear, the moon was out and it was still daylight in the early evening.  I saw a craft at a high altitude moving in the area of the moon at a very fast rate of speed. I was facing south. It had no vapor trail and did not make any noticeable noise.  The object appeared to be at an altitude of 30-40 thousand feet.  My friend was outside with me and I pointed it out to him.  I ran inside and got my binoculars, which are 8X50.  My friend looked first and he described an object which appeared to have no fixed wings, and he said it was an all silver cigar shaped object.  I looked next, and what I saw was a silver bottom and sided saucer with a small top in the center of it, the top side appeared to be white.  The craft appeared to be banking at an angle when I looked at it. There were no wings, no tailfin, and no exhaust that I could see. I ran back inside to get my camcorder, which took me about 20 seconds and when I returned, it was gone.  The craft moved across the entire horizon in less than one minute.;35.0226833333333;-78.6999375
