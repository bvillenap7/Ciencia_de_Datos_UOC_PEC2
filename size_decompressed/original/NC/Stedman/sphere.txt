At first look it looked to be a brilliant white light, a little larger than a star.   As I continued to watch, I could see that it what a sphere in shape and had the design of a star on the bottom.   The star was bright green and the arms of the star would open and close and the color would blink off an on.  \ In between each arm of the star was a bright red round light.   It appeared to be lowering in the sky as I could make it out better.;35.0226833333333;-78.6999375
