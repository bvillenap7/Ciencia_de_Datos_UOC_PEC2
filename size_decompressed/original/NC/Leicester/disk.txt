Digital pictures of alien ship in Leicester NC;2007-10-28 20:42:00;digial photo;Digital pictures of alien ship in Leicester NC I was staying at my sister’s house in Leicester, NC.  Her house is on the side of a mountain with the eastern view from its side and front. On the night on Oct 28th, I was walking my dogs and saw an orange half ball in the sky, at fist I couldn’t make out what it was, then I realized it was the moon coming up. It was such a perfect half circle in a bright fiery orange , I went inside and got a picture on my digital, there were white spots above the moon, which I took for stars, it wasn’t quite full night, it was approx 8:42pm. Then I turned to the side of the house and the stars were so bright there I took pictures also, the next couple of days I also took pictures of the sunrise And captured what I thought were stars. I’ll try to email the pictures with this. Where my sister’s house is, it’s in one the great energy vortexes in US, if you know about that.;35.6509999999999;-82.7107999999999
