I took my eyes away for 2 seconds to stop and put the car into park.When I looked back it was gone.There was also a jet in the sky that looked like bright dot and a vapor trail.It was very far away.The size of this star in comparison to the jet was enormous.It looked like a grape beside a lemon in size.My daughter saidthat was weird.I don't think a star would just disapear plus I've never seen a star in the daytime and I'm 32 years old.I think we saw something I couldn't explain to my daughter or myself.;35.6509999999999;-82.7107999999999
