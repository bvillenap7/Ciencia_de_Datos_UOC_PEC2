white orb moves into cloud;2006-07-12 16:15:00;3 seconds;white orb moves into cloud Well this isnt too fascinating, but it is definate and accurate. At around 4:15, July 12th 2006, I walked to my car. It was a bright day, blue sky and some white clouds here and there. I looked up and saw a small white orb move into a cloud. I waited for it too come out for 2 minutes and it never did. I seen it for 3 seconds move at a slow-medium pace and enter a cloud in a straight line. At the current speed and trajectory, it should of exited the cloud in 3 more seconds but it never did.;35.7782056768558;-78.8009503275103
Large round bright object seen flying above tree line in Cary, NC;2007-12-14 19:15:00;10-15 seconds;Large round bright object seen flying above tree line in Cary, NC It was a little after 7pm on Friday, Dec 14th 2007. The night was very clear and the stars were visable. I was reading on the balcony of my apt, located on the 3rd floor, which faces a wooded area.  I noticed something bright out of the corner of my eye.  To the right, above the tree line, I saw a large, round, very bright white object moving very quickly.  It moved so quickly it gave off a tail of light. The object made no noise at all and moved in a straight horizontal line. It appeared to be no more than 10 to 20 feet above the tree line. I jumped up from my seat to follow the object as it moved out of my sight, but it quickly disappeared behind my complex.;35.7782056768558;-78.8009503275103
plane's head lights, but the headlights were pointing down & the plane must be flying backwards???;2011-03-07 20:00:00;about 7 minutes;I'm not a great writer but I'll do my best. I'm male, 52 years old, some college, small business owner & very honest. I just moved down to Cary, N.C. from L.I., N.Y. a few weeks ago. On L.I., I would watch the stars as I smoked my cigarettes, which I never do in the house. Since moving down to Cary, it was upsetting to me that the sky had all this light pollution reflecting from the ground & the stars weren't as clear as in  L.I., N.Y., nevertheless, I would look at the sky when I would step out of the house to smoke my occasional cigarette.  I am used to seeing planes, jets & helicopters & have many years of orientation of what they look like at night. On 3-07-11 I stepped out for my cigarette break, looked up & saw this large star which I thought was a planet.  A passenger jet was flying west from Raleigh airport in the east.  As I'm watching the jet, I noticed that the star was moving above the jet from south to north.  If the jet was flying at 2,000 feet, I re-evaluated that the star was an object flying above the jet around 3,000 feet. The object was round, very bright white.  From looking at a typical star, the object was at least 20 to 30 times larger.  There was no beacon, no typical red & green lights.  I thought it may be a plane's head lights, but the headlights were pointing down & the plane must be flying backwards???  As I continued looking at it, it seemed to be flying higher then it slowly vanished.  I was and still am convinced that that was nothing I have ever seen a man-made aircraft do.   It was not a meteor, or a weather balloon, or swamp gas.... I came back in & told my wife & daughter what I've just seen & they laughed.  I know what I saw. Has anyone else reported this?;35.7782056768558;-78.8009503275103

There where 9 of them in groups of 3 in triangular shape.  Then 3 disappeared, leaving 6 behind.  Then another 3 disappeared with 3 left.
