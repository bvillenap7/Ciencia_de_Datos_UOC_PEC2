I stepped outside onto my front porch to smoke a cigarette, and something caught my eye and made me just stare for a minute or so before I actually realized that it wasnt a plane in the sky, and i ran back inside to grab my cell phone.   I ran back outside with my phone, and I started to record.  It was so incredible to be able to actually witness this happening right in front of me.  It was only about a football and a half away from me.  I've witnessed alot of very unexplainable things before, but nothing like what I saw that night. It was a round ball of light that just floated in the air and then started to move.  It danced around slightly and then eventually it disappeared behind a tree in my view.
