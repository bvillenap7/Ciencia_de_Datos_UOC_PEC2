The yellowish or orengeish craft was seen for about 5 min it flew a straight path and i showed my freinds it disapered above some trees and it had a oval shape ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Stationary Light Flashing Erratically, and Low Flying Object.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2008-04-15 21:30:00;5 Minutes;Stationary Light Flashing Erratically, and Low Flying Object A stationary strobe of bluish light was observed roughly 10 miles southwest of RDU Airport at 9:39PM EST. Two minutes of video has been recorded on a cell phone showing a stationary and erratically flashing bluish light. At approximately 9:40 a small blue light seemed to approach the flashing object from below and roughly east. At this point the larger stationary light ceases flashing and is replaced by a dim blue light at a constant brightness, and begins to travel roughly west, and away (and out of my view) from the approaching object – which also changes course, leaving the two lights moving in separate directions, almost simultaneously. It should be noted that the first, larger object/light had flight characteristics similar to a helicopter (though no sound was observed). The cell phone footage taken clearly shows the object as being stationary for the better part of two minutes. The footage also shows the light as flashing erratically and alternating between blue and possibly light green. At 10:02PM, a third object was observed. This time a neighbor witnessed. We both agreed that it was large, and didn’t behave or sound like any plane we knew of as it flew very low and very slow with only a very slight humming sound. It was observed in the distance as hovering initially by myself. The neighbor observed it only after it began moving east from roughly the same area as the original lights were observed at 9:39-9:40PM. This object flew approximately 1-2 miles from our vantage point (near highways 55 and 540, and at approximately 1,000 ft. It traveled no faster than 80-100 mph as a rough estimate. We observed this object as having approximately 6-7 lights. A bright yellowish green light in front, three or more red lights around its center, and two flashing blue lights near the rear. It disappeared behind a row of trees after approximately 1-2 minutes. Given the relative proximity to RDU Airport, we agreed that it could possibly have been some sort or plane. But its total lack of sound considering the short distance, and its extremely low airspeed were obvious and unfamiliar to both of us. No discernible shapes could be made of any of these objects.

I was driving down 40 on my way home from work.  It was about midnight.  The clouds seemed to be moving independently of eachother.  Ex;2012-01-26 00:00:00;1 minute;I was driving down 40 on my way home from work.  It was about midnight.  The clouds seemed to be moving independently of each other.  Except for one.  It just seemed stationary and there was a bright light behind it.  I wouldnt have thought anything of it but it didnt move or waver at all.  as I passed under it I noticed it just remained where it was.  unlike the moon when you drive continuously moving on the horizon with you.  There was no noise at all and I opened my window to be sure.  Silent.  Couldnt have been a helicopter.  I also know it wasnt the moon as the new moon was January 23 and we are not due for first quarter until January 30th.  I dont know what it was but when i exited the highway...I could still see it behind me in the exact same spot. bright flash in bellingham area. A flash of light lit my whole house. My dog freaked out.  At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out aswell.  I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.  I have never seen a UFO and don't nessasarly beleive in them, but I can not think of another explaination.  My girlfriend has witnessed a similar occurance.  Winter lighting???

I have never seen anything like it before;2015-11-19 21:00:00;30:00;I have never seen anything like it before On the deck of my house looking at moon all of a sudden different types of lights flashing from moon view it appeared to light up and dim down no sound but very changing orbital bright lights I notified of they did not see what I saw so if anyone saw this you would know it was not from our world.
