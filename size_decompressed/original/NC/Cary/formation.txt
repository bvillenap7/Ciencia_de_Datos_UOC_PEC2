Oval light changing from green to blue with red pinpoint of light in the middle.;2011-09-15 19:15:00;15-20 seconds;Oval light changing from green to blue with red pinpoint of light in the middle. I saw a lime green glowing oval light in the sky in Cary North Carolina, on Sept. 15, 2011 at 7:15 pm.  It did not appear as a solid object but a light, no bigger than the size of my pinky nail.  My mother and I were driving through our neighborhood when I saw the glow.  My mother saw the light briefly but was driving, and had to watch the road.  From the passenger side I watched the light slowly move across the sky, in a straight line trajectory. The lime green light slowly turned light blue in color.  In the middle of the now blue glowing light, a small pinpoint of red illuminated inside of it. A few seconds after the red appeared inside the blue glow it slowly shrank before fading away into itself.  The sighting only lasted about fifteen to twenty seconds.;35.7782056768558;-78.8009503275103
