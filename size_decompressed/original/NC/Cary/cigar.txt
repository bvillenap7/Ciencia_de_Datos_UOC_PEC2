It slowly glided for a bit then it went behind a tree I saw another flash of light and it never came out the other side. This was a couple years ago, I didn't know any plausible sources to contact until i saw this on National Geographic. I was a non-believer for the most part before hand, I spent awhile pretending it was a airplane, but it couldn't have been, the distance from me it was was unatural to the usaul planes. I have never been diagnosed with any type of condition in which i see things, I was checked for all those things when i thought i had depression, it all came out negative.
