((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))  Two small yellow-white lights moving parallel to horizon fuzzy ring of light;2005-04-29 21:00:00;90 sec;Two small yellow-white lights moving parallel to horizon fuzzy ring of light explodes around chaser continues to follow for ~1min. Correction!  Event date was 04/29/2005, not 04/28/2005.  Sorry!  Walking out of BJ's @ Centrum at 9:00pm tonight, I happen to glance southeast towards Jupiter when I see two small, moderately bright (say Mag 0) yellow-white lights about 3-5 moon diameters below it and one moon diameter apart. In an instant I see what at first I think is a firework explosion: a fuzzy ring of yellow-white light around the rightmost light, which expands to about 2 moon diameters in about 5 seconds, then fades out. The two lights move along a line northward, more or less parallel to the horizon, through the eastern sky. The rightmost (trailing) light is fuzzier that than the front (leftmost) one. Over the span of about 90 seconds they move about 25-30 degrees to the northeast, before they seem to fade out behind the clouds. During this time the leading light increased its distance from the trailing one to about 5 moon diameters. The trailing light grew less fuzzy over the period of time that I followed it. The velocity of the objects was consistent with either high-altitude airplanes or satellites. The speed, color, and brighness was not consistent with any meteor I've ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));35.7782056768558;-78.8009503275103

To bright, to smooth, but mostly to fast;2008-07-25 20:30:00;3-5 minutes;To bright, to smooth, but mostly to fast I was standing alone, on some railroad tracks simply looking up into the skies, noticing how many stars I could see compared to other nights.  The two nights prior to this night I had been noticing that there were becoming more and more stars each night.  This night, as im standing there, many airplanes begin to fly over head.  In total time of about 7 minutes, there were 6 planes.  Two where coming on my left, flying strait from east to west.  Four planes were flying directly over me, two of them clearing way up in the air, while the other two clearly flying low.  All planes were identifiable by their lights, the two four high ones making a small triangle with three lights, one white, and two blinking red and green.  Even the lower ones were noticeable with about 4 white lights in a line and a blinking red light I could only assume at the tail.  As they entered my airspace, I could hear the low planes, same as they left my airspace. As the first low plane passed directly over me, I noticed a newer thing just as low.  It had 4 white lights but these lights were to bright to be that of a plane and not quite bright enough to look as the stars did.  The lights almost made a shape of an L with the top two pretty much directly in formation, the third a little more to the right and out of formation and the fourth a little more out of the formation of the third.  Again I was looking at the first low plane that was just beginning to leave my airspace and took note of the sound it was making.  This L one however made no sound, speed was a little bit faster than those of the planes I was noticing but also, I did take reference of how smooth it seemed to go.  Of course it was night and to dark to truly see the smoothness in its ride, but I couldn't help but think and wonder about smooth. So a second low craft is coming over me, and I turn my direction to where I noticed the L thing and as a joke tempting more stars as I called this L thing, to fly.  That's when I see this single white light cruising through the air.  Now this Single, was as bright as a star.  Just as quiet as the L,  but was moving at a speed that was incredible.  This Single, with its speed, could definitely be described as moving really smooth.  Some say it might have been a shooting star, and I'll go along with it, but it was going to slow to be what I think I've seen as a shooting star, but way to fast to be any aircraft I've ever seen flying.  What really caught me was as it cruised I could see two stars that were directly in its path.  That natural humanistic thing to do was worry about a collision, due to the angle of which it was being seen.  But I kid you not, as they crossed paths, they became one, and as the Single would leave each of the two stars, I did take note that when right next to each other, they looked identical.  Both in size, shape, and brightness.  It was really quite inspiring to see something like this, that I could not explain, but still could not jump to any conclusions.   If this sounds familiar, please contact me.;35.7782056768558;-78.8009503275103

Red glowing light flew overhead prior to fireworks show;2013-07-04 21:00:00;several sightings through;Red glowing light flew overhead prior to fireworks show Last night (July 4, 2013) I had a series of several UFO sightings around 9pm, while outside watching the Fourth of July fireworks at Regency Park in Cary, NC. I was sitting near Symphony Lake, under some pine trees. I had a clear view of the lake, and of the sky above the lake where the fireworks would be (there was a gap in the group of pine trees, with a direct view of the spot across the lake where the fireworks are set off). We were all looking up at the sky, waiting for the fireworks to begin. Before the fireworks started, I suddenly saw a bright red glowing light fly over the lake. For a moment I thought it was the fireworks starting, but quickly realized it wasn't. The reddish light appeared quite large and low in the sky. It appeared about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It appeared to be flying lower than an airplane would fly. The strangest thing was that the light pulsed, or glowed, in a slow and steady rhythm, completely different from t! he lights on an airplane or helicopter. It glowed bright, and then waned, and when it had just about disappeared, it would resume glowing up to a bright red, and then wane again. It flew in a straight path above the lake. It flew overhead a total of three times before the fireworks started. I overheard one person near me commenting on it, wondering what it was.  Then, I also saw a different light formation fly over the lake. These ones were different: there were two lights, a yellow light and a green light (yellow on the left, green on the right), and they appeared to be connected as if they were on a solid object. These lights were smaller than the red light, about the size of typical airplane lights. They flew without blinking or pulsing. They flew overhead twice before the fireworks started, and then once during the fireworks show, at which point several people around me were joking that “that plane is going to run into the fireworks,” and other people said no, it must be higher than the fireworks. I couldn't tell whether it was higher than the fireworks or not. Then, after the end of the fireworks, when everyone was walking back to the parking lots, I saw the yellow and green lights fly overhead one more time, over the road (a little lower than an airplane would fly).  This is not my first UFO sighting I've had at least dozen UFO sightings in the Raleigh-Durham area in a little over a year. Most (but not all) of my previous sightings have happened when I'm driving at night.  Most of my previous sightings have also happened when I'm by myself, which made me question, at first, whether I was imagining things or not. Most of these sightings have been similar to what I saw last night-- strange colored lights flying in the sky, that don't look like airplanes or helicopters, and without any noise. I've also seen one &quotblack triangle&quot with lights that hovered motionless directly over my car, and I've also seen white starlike lights moving in the sky (seen in daytime, and once at night). My first UFO sighting, in April 2012, was the one that scares and baffles me the most. I would be willing to discuss it over the phone. The sighting last night was the first one where I could verify for myself that other people were seeing and talking ab! out the same things I saw. I don't know what these lights are, or what it means, but at least I know that other people saw them too.;35.7782056768558;-78.8009503275103
One exceptionally large and bright light appeared, dimmed, then moved away to the south, passing an identical object heading north.;2014-05-09 05:15:00;90 seconds;One exceptionally large and bright light appeared, dimmed, then moved away to the south, passing an identical object heading north. I was laying on my back on my deck listening to music and not paying particular attention to the sky when something extremely bright caught my eye through the trees overhead.  Just as I got up to get a better look away from the tree, it appeared smaller and dimmer.  Originally it was white and round, the size and brightness of a 1/4th sized full moon, nearly but not quite directly overhead, maybe up 75 degrees looking towards the west.   A moment later it looked like a dim star in the same spot in the sky, perhaps climbing straight up although the speed would have had to be exceptional.  Then immediately after dimming the object started moving exactly due south at a consistent speed.  I perceived it as being at an extremely high altitude and high rate of speed.  About half a second after I realized it was moving I saw another object identical to the first in fairly close proximity coming from the south and headed the exact opposite direction right by it at the same! speed and apparent altitude as the original object.  Both objects very gradually became dimmer as they moved away in opposite directions and maintained the same heading and velocity until I couldn't see either anymore.;35.7782056768558;-78.8009503275103
