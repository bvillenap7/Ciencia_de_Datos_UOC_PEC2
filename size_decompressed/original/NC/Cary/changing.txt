Object appears and hovers, strange maneuvering.;2010-01-10 14:00:00;15 min;Object appears and hovers, strange maneuvering. Earlier on in the day, approximately 11:00 a.m., I had witnessed 4 black helicopters in the distance flying north. They are not unusual but I have not seen any flying in formation like this here before. I was on a walk with my girlfriend and we both arrived back at the apt. around 2:00p.m. We were entering the stairwell from the parking lot and I noticed a strange looking large, slow moving object over head. I called it to her attention when we were on the stairs. It was so surreal! No noises, no recognizable shape at first. We both stood in awe and asked each other what it was. It looked as if it were a giant 3 orbed blimp, reddish brown in color. I ran into the apt. and snapped some pictures of it from my balcony. I watched it morph into the familiar classic saucer shape as it flew in a perfectly straight line south to where the helicopters were earlier. It hovered in the exact same spot for about 3 minutes and I took some more pictures of it. It slowly be! gan to lift up from its hover and ascended in a straight, vertical line up high in the sky to a point that it stopped and allowed for a passenger plane to pass by. I took a picture of the plane as it flew by, but the object was not visible for that brief instance. It stuck around for a few more minutes hovering and just like that it vanished. About an hour later, the same 4 black helicopters flew back by in the same area that the object was hovering. I donâ€™t know if there is any significance between the helicopters and the object, but it was very odd.
