6 Triangular hovering craft with synchronized lights.;2014-01-16 18:30:00;10 minutes;6 Triangluar hovering craft with synchronized lights My husband and I were driving at approximately 6:30pm, 1/17/14,  ((sic.  1/16/2014)) in Cary, North Carolina, in our car and noted 5 or 6 bright white lights in a diagonal and evenly spaced formation across the sky while we were driving.   After a couple of minutes, one light changed to red and was blinking.  Then the lights one by one turned to red and they moved in formation to the West and went lower in altitude and hovered in a horizontal line formation. The objects were hovering very low, and I rolled down the window and they were close enough that I could see the bottom of a triangular craft each with one bright white light and a red light.  They were very quiet, but I could hear a dull vibration sound that seemed to be coming from the objects.  The objects moved away after a few minutes and began to synchronize red lights one after another.  In about 2 minutes they moved away and out of sight.;35.7782056768558;-78.8009503275103
Black Triangle over Cary, N.C. Accompanied by Three Black Helicopters.;2014-03-10 23:15:00;45 seconds;Black Triangle over Cary, N.C. Accompanied by Three Black Helicopters As I finished up moving furniture for some family, I heard the distinct roar of choppers (helicopters) in the distance.  Being one to investigate late-night military craft (which I knew that they were) I sat outside on the steps, waiting for the choppers to pass.  About four and a half minutes into waiting, they broke from behind the tree line, and flew by the house.   They were blacked-out, say for the red lights on the noses of the aircraft.  As I stood to go back inside, my attention was drawn to huge white lights coming from behind the trees on the opposite side of my field of view.  I watched the lights emerge, and saw what I thought was a low-flying plane taking off from our local airport.  The craft moved quite slowly, and had three very bright white lights forming a perfect triangle.  The lights were very large to boot, almost touching one another.  I was able to make out another smaller white light in the centre of the three, as well as a slowly bli! nking red light on the plane opposite of the craftâ€™s direction of movement (i.e. a taillight).  I was able to see a black body around the lights.  The craft disappeared behind tree cover, and never attained significant elevation.   Both the choppers and the unidentified craft headed in the same direction east, towards downtown Cary.  It was only later that I realised that both the choppers and the craft came from the west of us, nowhere near the airport, which is north and east by a long shot.  The craft originated from the vicinity of Jordan Lake.  The next day, my boss said that he too heard choppers near his house in Wake Forest, sometime around 23:15.  He saw nothing, though.;35.7782056768558;-78.8009503275103
