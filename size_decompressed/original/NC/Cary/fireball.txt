Intrigued…and the wind was VERY strong due to an &quotincoming&quot storm from Ohio…..I began truing to arrange some things on my patio to keep them safe from the wind and there was this HUGE flash of light above me that literally gave me enough light to see what I was doing in almost pitch black…when I looked up, it had fizzled but it was a very true meteorite like tail as in when you see a shower, but this was much more powerful that all the stars I have seen do that. I am sad I did not see the actual beginning of it, and am curious to know what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
