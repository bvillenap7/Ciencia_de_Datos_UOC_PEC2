They appeared larger than a star and were moving in an eastern direction uniformly but very slow.   As they moved, 4 additional lighted objects appeared at the rear of the original formation.   I tried to get a photograph however my children were too frightened.  The lights varied in colors of white and light pink.  As they faded from view, it was if they disappeared individually.  They were observed above the tree line at a 75-90 degree angle from approximately 300 yards from the trees.  This was by far the strangest and most frightening thing I have ever witnessed.  My children were literally terrified.  I contacted our local Sheriff's office who had no other reports.   Both local airports were contacted by the Sheriff's Department and they had no reports either.  It was at the suggestion of the airport that this center be notified.  A phone call was also placed to the UFO Center on 3/14/2012 shortly after the sighting.  Local media was contacted but did not seem very interested - only that they would see if they had any other reports.;36.1839;-80.1651999999999
