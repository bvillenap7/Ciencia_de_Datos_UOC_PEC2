UFO over Greenville/ Winterville, NC (March13, 2012);2012-03-13 21:30:00;5 seconds;UFO over Greenville/ Winterville, NC (March13, 2012) I was looking at stars on my porch.  I was listening to wireless radio (pandora) from cell phone.  I had been experiencing interference (lots of static) all evening.   This had never happened before.   I had just witnessed shooting star and satellite (very bright at one point) 10-15 minutes earlier.   Shortly after I witnessed two airforce jets in trail heading back to Seymore Johnson Airforce base in Goldsboro.  The sky was clear (no commercial jets).   I noticed four orange/red lights moving in triangle pattern North over Greenville.   It looked almost holographic.   Then the lights banked and moved towards a Northwest direction.  There was no sound until lights banked.  I heard a woosh sound like wind passing through the trees.   Lights appeared to be 10,000 to 20,000 feet above ground.  It appeared to be a military craft.;35.5326;-77.3946
