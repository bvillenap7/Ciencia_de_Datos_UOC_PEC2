Slow moving white lights.;2014-10-12 20:25:00;15 minutes;Slow moving white lights. i saw what started out looking like the Big Dipper but I thought it was to low and then noticed it moving.  It moved from west to east very slow then when straight above me the dipper part fell into a straight line with the lights behind it and they just floated in a slight angle and disappeared.;35.5326;-77.3946
