Round object closely flying with large airplane, with 4 delta-winged fighters following in formation;2010-09-17 07:30:00;30-45 seconds;Round object closely flying with large airplane, with 4 delta-winged fighters following in formation Saw a formation of 5 planes and 1 round object flying at cruising speed north-east.  Lead plane was large, and appeared to be a passenger or cargo plane.  Following extremely closely was a small round object.   Object was surprisingly close to the large plane.  Just behind the plane and object was a formation of delta-wing jet fighter planes. Unsure of altitude, but it was high.    However, it was still close enough to determine that the front plane was a passenger style or cargo plane, and that the planes behind were definitely delta-wing jets.  All planes and the round object appeared to be traveling at the same altitude.  Planes were high-enough to be in view for 30-45 seconds. All planes and the object seemed to be traveling together, but one jet (the left-most in the group) was much farther away from the main grouping. The object was round, but could not determine if it were flat or spherical.  It flew extremely close to the front plane.  It flew as if it were part of the formation.  The other planes didn't display any unusual behavior.;35.5326;-77.3946
