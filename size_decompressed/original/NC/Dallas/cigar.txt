I live in Gaston County, N.C. out in the northern end, which is very rural. As I went out to feed my animals I looked up to the skies, and noticed that the planes were spraying chemtrails AGAIN, so as I watched on plane headed northwest I looked up and saw what appeared to be an object flying in the opposite direction.  This object was cylinder in shape and moving quickly across the shy, right over my house.  I didnâ€™t see any lights, nor did I see any wings on this aircraft.  The color seemed to be metallic grey, without windows.  I tried to capture it with my cell phone cam, but the object was moving so fast, that it was gone, before I could even open the camera feature to capture the object. This is my first UFO sighting, so you can imagine the shock and awe of this experience. I know for a FACT, that this was not a blimp, I know full well the difference, as I live around many small airports, where Blimps are stored. I can only compare this object to a giant flying cigar.
