Bright light in window;1987-11-01 04:00:00;10 minutes;Bright light in window I was awaken around 4AM with a giant bright light shining through my blinds into my bedroom window.  At first I thought it was the sun but it was too early.  It was so bright that I had to put my hands over my eyes to help sheild out the light.  It stayed there for around 5 minutes and then at very slow intervals it moved up for the next 5 minutes until it just disapeared.;35.3327;-81.1894000000001
Very large bright orange light that disapeared.;2013-08-12 02:50:00;8-10 minutes;Very large bright orange light that disapeared. While driving home from work my son and I were 1/2 mile from our home when we spotted a very bright orange light in the sky to the west of our location.   At first we thought the light was moving so we stopped in the road and watched for several min and determined it was stationary.   As we proceeded to our home we kept the light in our line of sight.  I could see the light as I was backing in my driveway.   In the very short period of time it took to exit the vehicle the light was no longer in our line of sight, my son and I ran to the clearing to the north of our home and the light was no where to be seen, we ran back to the house and returned in my vehicle to the location where we had first spotted the light and couldn't find any sign light.   We left this location and proceeded to another road which took us to the area where the light appeared to be when we first saw it and found nothing.  When we returned home we spent the next 30 min in the clearing looking for signs of the light.   With being in the country we have very clear views of sky which don't have city lights filtering into the sky.;35.3327;-81.1894000000001
