Cluster of black spheres seen over Candler, NC.;2016-01-07 17:15:00;10 minutes;Cluster of black spheres seen over Candler, NC. I was conducting a safety audit outside the shipping and receiving yard on the property of the company where I work in Candler, NC and I looked up and noticed a cluster of black circles or spheres.  They were about 8 to 10 of the spheres all the same size, all black, some were slightly scattered from the cluster pack, some higher and lower and spend out, but all close together.  The height I would guess was about 3 to 4 thousand feet above ground and they were travelling across the sky east to west at a speed of about 50 miles per hours – I’m guessing.   At first I thought it was a flock of birds, but no flapping of wings, maybe a cluster of black balloons, no, moving too deliberate and at a the same height and speed during the whole time I watched them.   Maybe a balloon powered micro lite, never heard of one and no engine sound coming from it.  It appeared to gain height to cross over a nearby mountain. ???;35.5385999999999;-82.7038
