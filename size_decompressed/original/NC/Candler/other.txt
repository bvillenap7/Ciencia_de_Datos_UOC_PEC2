U shaped UFO, made of light, over Candler, NC.;2016-07-22 00:00:00;5 minutes;U shaped UFO, made of light, over Candler, NC. My friend ((male name deleted)) and I were riding down Smokey Park Hwy., at ABOUT 9:55pm.  We both witnessed a very defined U or sort of Omega symbol shaped object in the night sky to the northwest.  It was made of VERY sharply defined light and have off no glow, or light-halo.  It was just basically a perfectly symmetrical capitol U shape of such bright and yet defined light, that even at the fairly long distance, it appeared away from us, we could both immediately confirm with each other that it was indeed a perfectly defined U made of bright light.   The sighting didn't last long because we were driving down Smokey Park Hwy, and first saw it in the sky above the CVS pharmacy as we headed in the direction of Patton Ave.  The U shaped object appeared to be standing still for the most part, but we both agree with it seemed like it was vvveeeerrry slowly sinking lower in the sky...  We soon lost visuals on it. Has anyone else ! ever seen a perfectly U shaped light in the sky (aka UFO) ?  Both my friend and I have witnessed the lights and other more common types of UFO's many times... However, we both saw this tonight, it was there, it wasn't some sort of satellite, aircraft, nor any balloon or flare.  Did anyone else see this object tonight?  Or this very defined U shaped light seeming to just hang suspended un the sky in this area tonight?  I have seen multiple different UFO's in my lifetimeâ€¦ However, almost all of those were the orbs of light... the Moving Stars.. so to speak..  However, I have never seen anything remotely like this U shaped object.  What a interesting thing to have seen... keep your eyes on the night skies, people!!!;35.5385999999999;-82.7038
