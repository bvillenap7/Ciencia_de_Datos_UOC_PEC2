Bright light faded to nothing;2003-12-30 18:15:00;less then 5 minutes;Bright light faded to nothing While letting the dogs out to use the bathroom.  I observed due south a bright light in the sky.  At first I thought this was Saturn.  But then I looked to the Southwest and saw Saturn.  While watching this light (it was as bright as Saturn) it faded out and disappered.  I called my wife to come out and watch.  Then the light returned got as bright as Saturn again and then faded out.  My wife stated that she thought that it moved away.;35.5385999999999;-82.7038
Bright red orb type light was seen on two seperate occasions, intelligently controlled and appeared to scan;2005-06-15 22:17:00;2 minutes;Bright red orb type light was seen on two seperate occasions, intelligently controlled and appeared to scan saw two very bright red orbs travel along our driveway had a laser/LED type intensity to them.  One (orb 1) broke off, rose and waited across the road from me  above a neighbors pond.  The other (orb 2) appeared to wait until orb 1 took position, then proceeded to travel along my driveway, broke off 90 degrees to the left of it's original trajectory and proceeded to close to within 30 feet (~20 feet off the ground) of me as i sat on our porch.  This orb then briefly appeared to scan me with a higher intensity projected light.  Immediately after this orb 2 extinguished its light and could no longer be seen.  Shortly after, orb 1 which had stayed in its position also extinguished its light.  Nothing more was seen until a week later when my wife also saw the same type of light outside of our living room window.  This sighting occurred at the same time of night.  Only one object was seen, but object was much closer to the house at about 15 feet away and 15 feet from ground.  Object moved from right to left approximately 10 feet distance with a curving right to left pattern.  My wife then hurredly left the scene and no further observation occurred.  Objects appear to move at about the same pace and pattern as a bumblebee, size of object is hard to discern, but about the size of a large coin.  Intensity is very similar to optical type LED lights.
