Red/Green Flashing Object, Low in Sky.;2015-10-23 02:45:00;10 minutes;Red/Green Flashing Object, Low in Sky I wanted to report my own experience concerning a red and green object this morning.  I was headed from Raleigh, North Carolina, towards Greenville, North Carolina, around two this morning.  I saw a red and green, possibly blue blinking Star.  However the lights flashed at different intervals.  It was the lowest object in the sky.   I thought it was a plane at first but it seemed to move ever so slightly to the left side of the star above it.  I'm pretty positive stars don't move.   Maybe if more people start paying attention to them we can raise awareness to find out what these things are.   I hope this will offer more information to those in search of answers.  I have never noticed this object before in my many, many drives back to Greenville.;35.608703004292;-77.3757424892702
A cylinder, moving left to right, 25’ in front of me, parallel to the pavement, 100 MPH or faster.;2019-11-12 17:20:00;5 seconds;A cylinder, moving left to right, 25’ in front of me, parallel to the pavement, 100 MPH or faster. Two weeks ago, on a Tuesday, just after dark, I was nearing home in my PU.  As I began to slow to turn into the driveway, an object crossed the road perpendicular to me, about 25 yards distant, traveling at least 100 MPH.  It was light tan, cylindrical in shape, about 2’ long, 6”s in diameter, and had no visible appendages.  It moved parallel to the ground, about 2’ above the pavement.  It traveled up a driveway to my right front, and did not appear to reduce it’s speed, in spite of obstructions that were in it’s path.   What was it?  I have no idea however, I did stumble across a History Channel show, about three days later, describing tubes that people are seeing, and that also show up on numerous photos and videos.  They come in various sizes and lengths, some with what appear to be ripple type wings, often with various colorations, and speeds occasionally too fast for the eye to see.  In fact, most of them are found on electronic media, after the fact. S ome have speculated that they are inter-dimensional in nature, capable of leaving our 3D reality at will.  I am clueless what was that thing?;35.608703004292;-77.3757424892702
