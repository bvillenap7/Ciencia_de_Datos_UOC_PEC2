Strange lights that hovered then moved rapidly, then stopped and moved rapidly again over great distances.;2000-12-12 23:30:00;30 minutes;Strange lights that hovered then moved rapidly, then stopped and moved rapidly again over great distances. It started out as two lights above each other off in the distance just above the tree line.  Then the lights moved very quickly in different directions.  At first they looked like stars, but when they started moving very rapidly and stoping on a dime it made me and my friend realize that this was something really weird, almost scary.  Then the lights became three lights, moving in all sorts of directions in almost a pattern like.  Then they moved very quickly and rapidly across the sky.  After that we struggled to find a video camera.  We ruturn to see the lights moving still accross the sky in different directions and stopping on a dime again.  It was like they were hovering, ten moving, then hovering then moving again.  Then the lights disapeared.  We then saw at least a dozen military jets converging on the area from three difernt directions.  My companion thought they were travelling from the direction of various military bases in the area.;35.608703004292;-77.3757424892702

Organized light craft over Greenville, NC;2011-09-12 01:00:00;2 Hours+;Organized light craft over Greenville, NC Initially stationary light noted on night of full moon, noticed flickers of silver and red nearby, so posted up for observation.  After about 2 minutes, light began moving extremely erratically, definitely organically, and almost appeared to be cloud-surfing though appeared to be at a greater distance than the clouds.  Telescope revealed small bright white light to be moving in spirals and loops at extremely fast speeds.   Clear weather allowed observation of nearby light points, thought initially to be stars, but showing subdued but similar behavior.  Light cones and flashes observed between no less than 6 objects spaced across the visual skyscape.   Activities continued for no less than 2 hours, observer had to crash for work.

Dec. 04th, 2011.

First we thought quietly to ourselves, because we thought it was an airplane. However we realized it was falling at a very controlled rapid speed on a diagonal straight-line decline of a 45-degree angle for 5 to 6 seconds. I was driving and slowed to witness it and thought secondly to myself, could it have been a shooting star?  But having witnessed many shooting stars from my permanent home it wouldnâ€™t have been visible for that long when I was slowing down the car to watch this super bright white object descend. Afterward it straightened out horizontally for a second or two and then disappeared completely. No more abnormally bright sphere present in the night sky. My roommate exclaims to me, Did you see that!   I reply,  Yes, we just saw a UFO! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
