V shaped object with no sound and colorful lights moving across sky at low altitude.;2002-11-18 22:20:00;2 minutes;V shaped object with no sound and colorful lights moving across sky at low altitude. The object was at low altitude. It was moving at the speed of a commercial airliner. It was V shaped and there was no sound coming from the object. There was several colors of light along the entire V. I observed the object moving in a North East direction for several minutes. As the object moved away no sound was ever heard coming from the object such as would be in the case of a jet or prop plane. It was a very clear night with a full moon. The only sound heard was dogs barking from a distance. When first observed the lights at the left end of the V shape from the rear seemed to be spinning in a circular motion.;35.608703004292;-77.3757424892702
