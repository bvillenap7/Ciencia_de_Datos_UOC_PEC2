At first I saw a bright red orb float directly upward then disappear.  Then it came back into site and floated downward.  Then it appeared somewhere else and disappeared and then came back to wear it was.  I haven't been watching the sky nonstop but I have been checking occasionaly and I have not seen it again.  This happened about half an hour ago, so I guess it stopped. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.608703004292;-77.3757424892702
