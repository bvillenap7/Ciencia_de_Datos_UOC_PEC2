Saw what appeared to be two burning round objects in the sky moving upward.   Objects were orange and flickering.  They moved slowly and then after a minute or so seemed to burn out and disappear.   About five minutes later another of the same objects appeared and did the same thing as previous two.;35.608703004292;-77.3757424892702
