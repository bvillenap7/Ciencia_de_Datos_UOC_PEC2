Flashing red and blue lights with white lights in center of cylinder object;2013-01-03 20:00:00;5 minutes;Flashing red and blue lights with white lights in center of cylinder object My daughter and I were riding in my car on Hwy 70, about to exit on Ranch Road when we saw blue and red flashing lights in sky, really low.  The blue light was on the left side and the red light was on the right side.  We were the only car on the highway, and I stopped to see what it was.   The object flew right over my car, and we could see white lights in the center of the object.  It was very close to my car and moving very slow, and I actually thought it was going to hit my car, because it was so low. It made a really strange loud sound and went over my car.  My daughter turned to see it behind us in the sky and then it disappeared.   It wasn't very big, maybe two or three times the size of my car, or that is how it appeared in the dark.;35.6469536723163;-78.4201525423727
Saw two white light 'sticks' with blue and red lights at night moving in a horizontal plane across sky with no sound being made.;2014-03-26 22:00:00;10+ minutes;Saw two white light 'sticks' with blue and red lights at night moving in a horizontal plane across sky with no sound being made. 3/26/2014 Over Garner/Clayton NC at around 10pm. I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water while I waited for the washer to finish the load of whites it was washing.  I looked out the window and saw what I thought was a bright star.   Then it flashed bright and I thought, 'that was weird' and kept looking at it.  It was long like a white stick with a blue and red light in the middle area.  About every 5 secs it would flash brighter or flicker on & off, I couldn't tell.   Anyway, I figured it was eye fatigue and was either a plane or a star but then I noticed it was moving ever so slightly on a horizontal line to the right (North).  I kept watching it because I figured I was tired and would figure out that it wasn't moving at all but it did and kept moving.   So I decided to step outside and have a look.  First thing I noticed is how quite it was... dead silent.  There's usually the sound of traffic on Hwy 70 at the minimum or a dog barking but nope... nothing.   Then I noticed a second 'star' with the exact same qualities as the first and verified the other one was still where I had last seen it so... there were actually two ! of them.  Both were silent, high up, looked identical and were moving very, very slowly in a horizontal motion heading North.  I watched them for about 10 mins and then went back inside cold and alittle bit freaked out.  Not sure what they were but they definitely were not helicopters or planes as there was no sound and they were moving way too slowly.
