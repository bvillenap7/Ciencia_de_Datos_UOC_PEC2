Unusually long dark shape, moving very slow, no lights, no sound, at tree level.;2018-12-04 17:30:00;2 minutes;Unusually long dark shape, moving very slow, no lights, no sound, at tree level. December 4, 2018 about 5:30 pm at dusk.  Sky was orange colors from sun set.  Clouds were dark. Very pretty sunset.  In my car, waiting at traffic light at highway 42 west, to turn left onto Government Road in Clayton, NC.  While waiting to turn, I was looking West. Something moving caught my attention.  At the tree level, which I estimate to be around Cornwallis Road, which is West of Government Road about 1 mile away.  Something was flying low above tree level.  Very long, (comparing size with distance) slender shape.  No lights could be seen on shape.  Dark like the clouds black silhouette.  Could not see wings or tail of an airplane.  No sound was heard.  Object was moving very slowly from south to north.  I had to move with traffic, so, I made my turn.  It was very unusual.  We see military large cargo planes all the time around here.  They fly low, but, this was even lower.;35.6469536723163;-78.4201525423727
