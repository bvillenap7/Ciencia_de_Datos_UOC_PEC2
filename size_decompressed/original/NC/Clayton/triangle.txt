Black triangle.;2012-11-12 18:50:00;20 seconds;BLACK TRIANGLE I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK LAST NIGHT [11/12/20120]HEADING DOWN HWY 40 SOUTH OF RALEIGH N.C. CLOSE TO THE EXIT FOR HWY 70 AND SAW A TRIANGLE CRAFT WITH 3 LARGE WHITE LIGHTS IN THE CORNERS.  THE CRAFT WAS LOW AND MOVING SLOW. IT WAS GOING FORWARD BY THE LARGE FLAT SIDE AND NOT ONE OF THE POINTS, I THOUGHT THIS WAS ODD. IT WAS AN OMG MOMENT AND I DID NOT GET A PICTURE AS I COULD HARDLY TAKE MY EYES OFF OF IT UNTIL IT DISSAPPEARED OVER THE TREE LINE. IT DID NOT MAKE ANY NOISE THAT I COULD HEAR AND SHOULD HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY AT THAT SPEED.;35.6469536723163;-78.4201525423727
Triangle formation, many orbs appearing, moving, stopping then taking off or disappearing.;2014-05-24 02:45:00;3 hours;Triangle formation, many orbs appearing, moving, stopping then taking off or disappearing. We saw a lot of strange activity in Clayton, NC, USA during the meteor shower last night/this morning.   We first saw 3 stars moving in formation across the sky from north to south, stopped and started to rotate and change the shape of the triangle.  We had already noted what we thought were satellites that you would normally see, but after an hour we realized we had seen over 100 satellites and most were moving in unison with at least one more off in the distance and converging somewhere beyond the horizon.   Other stars or satellites would appear, begin to move, stop and disappear from vision.  Others would line up within the triangle we first saw and then either disappear or begin to move out of the formation.   We also noticed what we first thought was a bright star over the horizon, but after it not moving for 3 hours we watched it closer and it, too, was dancing around in a somewhat static location.   The craziest thing I have ever witnessed.  I think we watched all this from 2:45am EST to 5:30am (EDT).   We noticed what seemed to be military aircraft occasionally flying directly below the triangle formation on 3 occasions.   We also noticed what may have been the ISS pass directly below it around 3:30 a.m. EDT. although I have not checked to see where it was at that time.;35.6469536723163;-78.4201525423727
