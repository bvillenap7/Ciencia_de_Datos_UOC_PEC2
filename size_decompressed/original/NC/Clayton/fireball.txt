witness to the too close meteor in durham, nc. : meteor or ufo?;2003-10-20 20:45:00;brief;witness to the too close meteor in durham, nc. : meteor or ufo? i just saw in the compuserve news that on the date above, what i thought was an abnormally close meteor was being construed by people in durham to be a ufo. i saw it in clayton, out of the corner of my eye. i was with my brother in law in his truck, and we were at the intersection of 70E and alternate 70, and he was looking the other way because he wasn't speaking to me, because i work for him and i was 5 mins. late.i saw near the horizon, northwest, a blazing streak of green light with a white and orange fireball on it, and i made a wish on it! i looked for smoke or a vibration to say that it landed, but there was none, and i thought, that was too too close. and i thought, what kind of damage could it have done? it's almost halloween and i know there's a possibility of this being a joke, but there was an unusually bright meteor out there at 8:45pm on monday, 20 October 2003. i'm not mistaken about the time because we were due into smithfield at 9:00 and we were running late. i do believe in life on other planets, because we can't be so egotistical to believe that we're the only ones, and i do believe that some of them have more advanced civilizations, and a few could probably stand floating around in a space station for a few hundred years. but could they make it to earth? that's the question. i still think what i saw was a too close meteor, but i'm interested in hearing your take on it. thank you.;35.6469536723163;-78.4201525423727
