Sphere shaped object about the size of a water tower, spinning rapidly.;1988-08-20 19:30:00;2 Minutes;Sphere shaped object about the size of a water tower, spinning rapidly. I remember the night very vividly and I am pretty sure about the date because it was the day before school started back.  My mother and I were riding home from the grocery store and as we approached the road we lived on we noticed a big redish/orange sphere above the trees.  At first we thought it was the moon because sometimes when the moon rises it looks red, but we marveled at how big it was. As we got closer we noticed that it wasn't the moon and it was hovering about 30 feet above the tree line right where we had to turn.  Well, as we turned down our road the object was on the passenger side where I was sitting and I got very good look at it.  It was about the size of the top of a water tower and it was spinning very rapidly, it had the same texture as you see in pictures of a glowing hot sun, and vapor was shooting off of it as it spun.   I was 8 years old at the time and I remember going to school the next day and telling my teacher and other students in the class what I saw because I was sure one of them had seen it too... unfortunatly none of them had seen it and found the story very amusing...lol  The object was seen by me and my mother in Clayton off of Powhatan Rd. and Davis Rd.  David Rd is now Glen Laurel Rd.;35.6469536723163;-78.4201525423727
Orange ball of light moved slowly and then sped up without sound.  ((anonymous report);2017-12-11 19:00:00;2 minutes (max);Orange ball of light moved slowly and then sped up without sound. I was working at my grocery store tonight and I was collecting carts outside.  I look up into the sky and see what I thought was a very bright star.  It is a bright orange and a little bigger than common stars you will see.  I then notice it moving slowly, there were no flashing lights and no noise coming from it, so it could not be an aircraft.  There was no light streaking off of it and the speed was very slow, could not be a comet.  It began to move faster and went over store and off into the distance before I could get any photographs or video.
