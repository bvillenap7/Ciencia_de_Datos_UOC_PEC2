Steady bright white ball of light moving above tree line and then disappears in cloudless sky;2007-08-24 23:00:00;20 seconds;Steady bright white ball of light moving above tree line and then disappears in cloudless sky My wife and I were on our front porch at around 11 pm on Friday, August 24th.  I was laying down on the porch relaxing and she was sitting on the steps.  She suddenly says, “Oh My God!”  I sat up asking what she had seen.  She stated that she had never seen anything like what she had just witnessed.  I asked her what she saw and she stated she witnessed a steady glowing ball of light moving away from the tree line across from our property and it suddenly disappeared.  I asked her if it was a plane and she said she had never witnessed a plane disappear like that in a cloudless sky and that most planes have blinking lights.  The night was very clear with visible stars. To my dismay, I did not witness it and am only reporting what she saw.  Background on my wife is that she is an intelligent individual with no claims of witnessing a UFO before, but believes they are a possibility.  She is not claiming this was an Alien craft, but she was dumbfounded as to what it could have been.  Thank you!;35.6469536723163;-78.4201525423727
Flashing red,blue and white lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a twinkling star, perhaps Arcturus, we suspect.  PD));2011-07-18 01:30:00;1/2 hour;Flashing red,blue and white lights. I took my dogs out at 1:30am on July 18th, 2011. The sky was clear and I could see stars better than I have before.  I was looking at the sky and thanking God for giving us a beautiful night when I saw something in the Southwestern sky that was unusual.  I initially thought it was a star but because it flashed red on one side and blue on the other with white in the background at equal intervals, I decided it wasn’t a star.  It stayed in the same position for 15 minutes, was over a tree, and didn’t change  course. I came in the house, got my binoculars, and went outside and tried to make sense of the flashing pattern.  It didn’t feel right.  The red and blue lights I saw were vertical strobe lights with white lights in the background.  It looked like an intergalactic police car.  I got my 11 year old son outside and he saw the same thing.  It wasn’t an airplane, radio tower, helicopter, nothing of this world, it didn’t move. We watched it for 20 minutes and I ran in the house to get my telescope.  I had to unpack it (that took 10 minutes) and by the time I got it outside, clouds had covered the lights. One half hour later, the clouds moved out and the sky was clear again.  I checked the position of the moon which had moved very little and the planet/star/lights should have still been visible but were GONE!  I looked all over the night sky and didn’t find the same lights again. I will check tonight, again! ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a twinkling star, perhaps Arcturus, we suspect.
