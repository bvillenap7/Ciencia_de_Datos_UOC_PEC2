Red orb interaction with aircraft;2013-10-27 07:02:00;1;Red orb interaction with aircraft Shortly after dusk I came out and sat at my usual sitting spot...  Looked up to see what I thought was mars because it was red and not blinking...   About 30 seconds later it started moving south slowly... I stood up to move to see beyond my carport where it was moving.  I seen it move in front of an aircraft moving from what looked like from ne to west and vanished right in front of it about 10 miles.   The light seemed larger than what came from the plane so it may have been larger or closer than the plane but it was very odd that it disappeared right before the plane hit the same spot I seen.;36.2942;-80.3608000000002
