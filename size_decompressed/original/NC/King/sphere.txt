Large green orb defied physics;2015-10-15 23:15:00;30 seconds;Large green orb defied physics. October 2015.  Work 3rd shift, left for work approximately 11:15 pm.  Drove around Â¼ mile from driveway, and upon passing the end of a wooded area, my attention was drawn to my right and up, over a large, open tobacco field. (Approx. 22 acres).  There was an illuminated green orb that looked akin to a Christmas tree ornament (the mirrored ball type) hovering at an estimated altitude of 1000-1500ft AGL.   The orb appeared to be 30-45ft in diameter.  I would guess the distance from my vehicle horizontally to be about 150 yards, as I had to lean over the steering wheel and look up through the windshield to keep the object in view.   I witnessed the object remain at a dead stop, hovering, for about 15 seconds, before it began to accelerate away from me in a straight line.  It accelerated slowly, at first, but smoothly gained speed so tremendous that before it had even reached the horizon, it disappeared.  Was undoubtedly NOT natural phenomena.;36.2942;-80.3608000000002
Fast spinning Orbs with light hovering in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD));2017-02-12 19:00:00;~2 hours;Fast spinning Orbs with light hovering in the sky Saw what looked liked a really bright star or possibly a planet.  However after Looking through binoculars and saw a fast spinning rotating orb with flashes or red, blue and green in it.  Appeared to be like it was made out of electricity.It also appears when looking at film of it that there is some sort of heat signature or force field for lack of a better term surrounding it.  There were dark orbs or shadows moving in and around it as well as little flashing lights like fireflys.  The orb moved around sort of zigzag patterns.  At one point it descended below the roof line of our neighbors house in a matter of seconds and then came back up.  We witnessed a second one to the left and it looked very similar although it was hard to focus on as it was further away and moving so quickly and in fast short circular patterns.  We have been seeing this for several months off and on though this was the closest it has been.  My husband has recorded several videos of this object. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.
