I was taking a walk around 8:00 when i looked up to see a white/tan colored beam moving in the sky. I thought it was a jet, but it moved faster than a jet and it had absoulutely no smoke coming from the back. I looked at it until trees blocked the rest of my view. It was evening/dawn and no clouds in the sky. It looked like some kind of bolt or beam. Not sure. The whole thing was very bright and looked reflective and shiny. I was going to take a picture, but left my phone at home. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));34.6623479646016;-79.082241946903
