Strange triangular shaped craft in the sky.;2012-05-11 05:10:00;3 Min;Strange triangular shaped craft in the sky. I was leaving my house about 5am, when my wife and I noticed a bright light off in the distance. We both made a comment about never seeing a light in that area, at this point in time we both just thought of it as a bright star. I then got into my truck and started to drive in the direction of the strange light, and as I got closer it became more evident that this was not a star. As I came up on the strange light I noticed it was triangular in shape and seemed to be floating in the sky like a balloon full of helium. The bight light we were seeing was coming from two bubble shaped window like structers (at this time I was almost under the craft). At this time I reached for my phone to take a picture but like a flash it was gone. I then called my wife to see if she could still see the object, but she could no longer see the object. One last note, I have worked in the aviation most of my adult life and have never seen anything like this.;34.6623479646016;-79.082241946903
