On or around the 19 Nov, 02 I was driving on a rural road outside lumberton NC proper. It was dark outside but it was clear and the stars were visible. Although there were many trees around there was an open field around me for at least 500 to 700 meters. I saw out fo the corner of my eye an object with no other lights except a dull green color. I know that most aircraft have red, and plain white lights with at least one blinking light on either wing. The object was at least 300 to 400 meters ahead of me flying at least 500 feet or tree top level from a south to north direction. I pulled over on the side of the road and noticed through my sunroof that the aircraft was diamond shape with 4 dull green lights at each corner. There were no discernible details ofthe aircraft but I could see its shape against the sky. As I rolled the window down the aircraft had already crossed my path, but I heard no engines or propellers. The aircraft just left without a sound. I have just fin ished a 20 year hitch in the Army, I have jumped out of C130, C141, and other rotary aircraft and know what they sound like. But this aircraft left no type of exhaust or other sound signature behind. I never beleived in UFOs untill now. Ft. Bragg and Pope air Force Base are only 50 miles away, but their aircraft fly through this airspace all the time. These aircraft do not I repeat do not fly as low as this aircraft flew.;34.6623479646016;-79.082241946903
