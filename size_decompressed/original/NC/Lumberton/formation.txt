PD));2006-02-18 22:50:00;1hr to 45 min;3 lights that circled in one area ,that put on a show The lights were circling around one general area,they were really fast moving, 3 were in one formation together in the western sky, 2 other lights were in the far distance circling in the same pattern, for most  the time there were 3 of them keeping a constant circling motion, 2 would follow each other real close while the 3rd one keep its distance, its like they were putting on a show, at first I thought they were show lights but we live way out in the country , i started to think show lights have a light trail were you can tell were its orginating from these didnt.  They were as if above the clouds, I contacted my local police dept to find out if anyone elese saw them.  I have always been a firm believer that we are not alone in this big universe and i kknow with out a doubt what happend to night proves it. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights.
