The object appeared to be a orange luminous sphere behind a clear blue sky, as quickly as it emerged it was blocked again by another cloud, although the sighting lasted only seconds,  I still can't fully explain what I saw, other than some kind of atmospheric phenomenom. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.101;-83.079
