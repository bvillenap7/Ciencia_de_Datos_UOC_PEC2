Green/white lights of several UFOs seen by two private citizens.;2012-03-31 00:15:00;5 hours;Green/white lights of several UFOs seen by two private citizens. At first I thought the first one I saw was a bright star but suddenly it darted to LSF in one quick surge. I began watching and noticed it changed colors from green to bright white. There appeared to be a grouping of lights in one vehicle but they all seemed to be one light also. The vehicle appeared to be hovering for a while then moving to another location within a pattern. The light constantly moved as in a searching pattern. As I watched for over an hour I saw other vehicles appear at a distance then disappear.  I finally went to bed with my feelings unresolved about what I was seeing.  I arose at 5:39 this morning and walked out the back door to see if it was still there.  It appeared to be gone when all of a sudden a bright flash almost directly overhead showed the vehicle was still here but in a different.  At that point there were sudden flashes of other vehicles scattered throughout the general area.  I have never seen a UFO before and feel pretty i! gnorant about reporting my sighting, but I am positive of what I have seen this night and am thoroughly confused to the duration and number of vehicles I have seen.  I hope this report can be of some small help to your organization.;35.9516;-81.049
