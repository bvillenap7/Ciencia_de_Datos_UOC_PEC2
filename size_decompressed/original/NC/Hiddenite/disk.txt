I just stood there dumbfounded. It hovered over my neigbhors house (which is about 300 yards from my house) and then it just zoomed off in a southwest direction toward Hickory, NC. When I tell people about it - no one believes me - but I know that I did not imagine it - I know that I saw it. The lights flashed one right after the other - blue, green, red - then the saucer would turn opposite the direction the lights were flashing.;35.9516;-81.049
