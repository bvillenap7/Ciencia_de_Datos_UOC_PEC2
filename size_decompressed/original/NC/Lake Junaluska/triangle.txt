Single red light on and off at random.  No sound. Looked like a kite at first.  One red light at bottom right, randomly on and off, not flashing.  Hovered then moved slowly below our line of sight.  No sound.  No lights other than the single red light.   The bottom of the triangle was larger than the two sides and had some additional projection in the bottom area.  It was not a helicopter, kite, or parachute.  Probably not an ultralight...no sound...too near dark.   July 4th fire works began soon after the sighting.;35.5258;-82.9704
