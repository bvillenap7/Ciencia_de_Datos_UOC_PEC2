The lights flickered and seem to change with smaller lights appearing around a central white light.  I watched it and it was making no consistent progress toward any direction.  I then thought it was a star, but every once in a while it moved erraticaly coinciding with strange feelings that it was going to move. The movements were way different than a plane, or any plane that I have seen.  I still thought it was probably just a star, but i noticed that my original point of observation (where I had been watching it through the trees) had changed significantly.  I saw a plane fly overhead and I lost sight of the light.  Soon it reappeared assumably from behind a cloud but vanished soon there after.  I came inside to check the night sky map to confirm that it was a bright star or planet.  Since it was almost certainly the brightest star I saw in the sky.  I sky mapped only the brightest level magnitude of star.  I estimated its bearing to be sw -  wsw, but could night readily identify a star which corresponded to its position.  It was probably nothing more than a star or planet that I could not identify, but if anyone else saw something this could be a secondary source.;35.9108000000001;-79.0836
