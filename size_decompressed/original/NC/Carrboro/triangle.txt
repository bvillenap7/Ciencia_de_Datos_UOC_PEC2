Black Triangle jets silently over Carrboro NC;2012-11-03 21:00:00;3 seconds;Black Triangle jets silently over Carrboro NC While peeing in the composter in my backyard on Saturday November 3, 2012, at approximately 9pm I saw what at first I thought was a falling star.  I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia when a streak of light caught my attention.  The object came out of the North to the left of Cassiopeia.  As I craned my neck to follow it across the sky I realized it was a perfect black triangle with white lights on each point.  It continued its straight path out of sight beyond the tree line.  It was very fast, with no sound. 3 seconds total.;35.9108000000001;-79.0836
Three lights as bright as the moon, possible triangle.;2015-07-23 23:00:00;5 minutes;Three lights as bright as the moon, possible triangle. I was out jogging down Rock Haven Road/BPW club.  I saw two bright hazy orbs in the west- south western sky.  They were basically in line with Carrboro High School's track and field area.   It was cloudy last night, so I thought it was the moon coming through the clouds.  These lights looked as bright as the moon, and had the same slightly yellowish-white color.   I proceeded to jog for approximately two more minutes, when I looked up at the sky, what I thought was the moon had shifted its position in the sky.  The lights were no longer in line with the track and field area, and appeared from my vantage to now be at the north end of the high school.   I continued to jog, now about to turn on BPW club, when I could actually see the object moving at approximately the same speed I was running (~6 mph) to the North-north east. The two original orbs were visible, and I thought I could make out a dimmer third light.  There was no sound.   I was alone and got frightened.  I discontinued observing the object and jogged back to my apartment.  While doing so, I called my mother, thus I did not experience any sort of electrical interference.   It should be noted, that I could not easily tell how far the object was away from me, so my estimates of speed are likely very incorrect.;35.9108000000001;-79.0836
