Flying object seen making darting and odd manuevers for 30 minutes.;2007-01-14 18:23:00;30 minutes;Flying object seen making darting and odd manuevers for 30 minutes. I was at the east bound exit ramp of hwy 40 and hwy 86.  I casually looked up at the sky to see maybe the big dipper.  I then notice what I thought was a shooting star but it travelled in a straight line for 5 seconds and came to a complete stop.  It then started moving back and forth perpendicular to the origianl path. It did this oscillating motion for several minutes and the would make darting and hook like movements, erratic then settle down a little, then start up again. it proceed to my right. I tried to call several friends, I reached one and asked to go outside and look at the sky. I told where to look based on the bright stars in a vertical line. I told her to look to her left quite aways and look at the star by itself. I said what do you see. She said its moving up and down. I called other friends but by then it had receded. The event lasted about 30 minutes or so.;35.9108000000001;-79.0836
We were walking at night, and saw a large object (about 1/3 the size of the moon) that appeared to be a ball of fire moving in the sky;2012-05-02 23:35:00;Five Minutes;We were walking at night, and saw a large object (about 1/3 the size of the moon) that appeared to be a ball of fire moving in the sky At 11:30 at night, on 6/2/12, my wife and I were walking on Westview Drive towards Main Street in Carrboro, NC. I looked up in the sky, and noticed what looked like a ball of fire. I believe that the UFO was towards the South-East sky.  I asked my wife if what I saw was a planet, and she commented that the celestial body was about 10X too large to be a planet. The UFO had the appearance of a fireball, and it looked like the surface may not be strictly stationary. Additionally, the fireball was moving about, but it stayed within the South East sky. We walked in awe, watching this huge ball of flame in the sky, until we came upon a little convenience store, and approached a guy sitting outside of it, to show him as well.  He saw it as well. Right after this third party saw the body, it suddenly got much smaller and disappeared into the night sky.  In describing this to people I’ve said that it most closely resembled a fish disappearing into the ocean: it kind of sunk out of view, it didn’t just go away, or fade, or seem to shoot off anywhere.;35.9108000000001;-79.0836
