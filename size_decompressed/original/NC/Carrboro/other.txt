Moving components of the scaffolding like arms spun slowly and steadily around a core. Jets of white would protrude from the spinning arms periodically.  These jets would appear every 2 or 3 minutes and last for several seconds before disappearing.  The jets would extend out in columns that were slightly shorter than the radius of the craft.  The jets looked like they were made of white fire.  Asymmetrical components were attached to the scaffolding.  It hovered extremely high up in a cloudless sky.  I watched it for about 20 minutes with two friends.;35.9108000000001;-79.0836
