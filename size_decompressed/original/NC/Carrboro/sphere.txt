While I was driving down Highway 54 at 12:25am on October 4, 2016, in Carrboro, NC, out of the corner of my left eye to the southwest of 54 A rather prominent & radiant spherical shape suddenly appeared in the night sky, hovering above at about the distance a helicopter would be.   This low-flying ball of light was bright green/turquoise and translucent the light emitted seemed to glow and rotate within itself it also seemed to leave behind a fast fading light trail as well.  It moved quickly and silently across the night sky and seemed to be descending.  My windows were down and this Light-Object did not make any sounds, it faded out of view and the entire experience lasted only a handful of seconds.   I exited onto Jones Ferry Road and kept my eye on the sky, but did not notice any further activity.  This object was unlike anything I had every previously seen.  It did not seem to match the traditional description of any aircraft, or astronomical activity that I am traditionally familiar with or have seen.;35.9108000000001;-79.0836
