It was closer than a plane would fly but not extremely close to the ground.  It was hovering when I noticed it.  I thought it was odd shaped for a plane.   Then it turned and I could see it was shaped like a hat with a brim.  It then started going higher in the sky.  It was not going super fast, but obviously faster than an airplane.  It just kept going up and up and getting smaller and smaller until it was no longer visible.;35.9108000000001;-79.0836
