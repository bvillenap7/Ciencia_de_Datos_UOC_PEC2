I live on Tusquittee Mountain outside of Hayesville, NC.  At or about 20:00 I saw a red fireball like object above the neighboring mountain south of my location.  It moved very slightly and then shot off to the west and then up at an incredible speed. I have NEVER been a proponent of UFO's, but this was something I could not deny or pass off.;35.0422;-83.783
