Very bright white triangular object gliding across the sky.;2006-11-10 20:52:00;3 Minutes;Very bright white triangular object gliding across the sky. I always look at the night sky when I go out to smoke.  Tonight I was looking around, and saw a slow moving very bright light in the distance, up in the sky, through the tops of the trees.  Like you can see the moon through the tops of trees sometimes when it is low.  In fact, when I saw it, I thought it was the moon, and tried blow it off.  Then I noticed that it was moving slow, but steady, a little higher into air.  I did the whole blinking thing, and tried to look at it harder, to try to figure out what it was I was seeing.  Now we are about 30 miles from an airport, so planes are around a lot, but this wasn't a plane.  As a matter of fact, an airplane was flying toward the direction of the triangular object.  The plane was higher than the object, but I was able to see them together, and the plane had the regular blinking light on it, but the object did not!  There were three very bright lights.  Almost the glow of a stadium light.  Not like fire, but like an electric looking white light.  IT sort of glided through the sky, at a fairly low altitude.  I watched it until it was out of sight.  When I told my dad, he though I was crazy, but he asked if the lights were on the front or the back.  That is sort weird when I thought about, because it wasn't either.  I saw the lights coming and going.  Maybe like they were on the bottom??  Now I must say, that I have never put a whole lot of stock in UFO sightings, or aliens.  Actually I have never really cared, so this is really taking a lot for me to submit this.  I would though like to know if anyone else has seen this before.  Maybe some pictures if anyone has some of these triangular white lighted objects.  Thanks!;35.8278;-79.8996
