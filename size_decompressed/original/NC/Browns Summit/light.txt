At 4:00 am on Monday, February 24, 2014, I went out to smoke a cigarette.  I am often up at this time of morning.  I woke at 3am this particular morning.   I turned on my porch light then opened the front door.  I went to light my cigarette and looked to the right of my front porch toward the neighbors yard.  I saw the street light that belongs to someone across the field.   To the left of that street light slightly above the tree line was what appeared to be a star.  It was sitting there and appeared to be moving very slowly.  It was barely above the trees so I watched for a few minutes.  The light was bright yellow-white and fading in and out.  No sounds that I could hear, and it is very quiet here at 4am.   It was not blinking.  It would fade in and out completely to where you could not see it until it lit back up.  Those fade outs lasted a couple of seconds each time.   I watched for about 10 minutes longer then I went back into the house.  When I looked out the window a, few minutes later, it had disappeared.   So to be sure it was not still there, I opened the front door again, and it was gone.  I scanned the sky to see if it had moved toward the moon like a star but it was gone.   There was some wind blowing at the time but once the light was gone the wind subsided.   I have witnessed this yellow-white light several times in the past 4 years in different locations of the area I live in.   Always the same pattern.  Just above the tree line between 2am and 4am for about 10 to 15 minutes each time.;36.2019;-79.7100999999999
