Very bright silver circle seen in the sky.;2010-10-29 17:45:00;5 minutes;Very bright silver circle seen in the sky. At 5:45, I was taking a walk around the neighborhood, when I looked up and noticed a very bright silver circular object in the sky.  I stopped walking and watched the object for 2 minutes .  The object did not move at all it sat perfectly still, made no noise and was approximately  300 to 500 feet in the  air (not certain how high up it was).  I turned for a minute to see if anyone else had noticed this and by the time I turned around the object was gone.  I checked  the sky all around me and saw no chemtrail  or  anything associated with fast moving planes. At  5:49, I saw 2 low flying fighter jets  pass by at a high rate of speed.  Then further up in the sky I saw 2 more fighter jets climbing  up in the sky in the general area of where the object was located.  The sun was still out and this object was a very bright silver, I almost had to cover my eyes to look at it.;36.2019;-79.7100999999999
Phenomenal sighting of 12 orange balls of light in the night sky, as they slowly combined and faded away!;2017-10-17 20:00:00;8 minutes;Phenomenal sighting of 12 orange balls of light  in the night sky, as they slowly combined and faded away! Approximately 12 orangish and yellow balls, almost looking as if balls of fire were floating in the sky,  they were not as high as the stars above, yet were in formation almost as if they were a constellation of some sort, but they did not at first appear to be moving, as if they all were just there floating.   Then slowly they began to form closer clusters of three and four together, slowly they began to fade.  When there was only three left, it were as of one just disappeared as the rest then the last two gravitated towards each other and then became only one.  Never once did they get larger, yet appeared to just combine and slowly the last one just faded away.;36.2019;-79.7100999999999
