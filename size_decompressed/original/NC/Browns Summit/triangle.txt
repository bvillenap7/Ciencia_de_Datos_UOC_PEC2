3 orange/red glowing lights in the shape of a triangle.;2015-02-21 17:30:00;10 minutes;3 orange/red glowing lights in the shape of a triangle. About 935pm, I walked outside to let the dog out.  I looked up in the sky and saw 3 glowing red/orangish circles in a perfect triangle shape.  I tried to take a picture but my flash was on.   When I went to turn it off, a neighbor came pulling up fast.  He said did you see that!!!   The bottom right one disappeared very quickly going to the right.  It was like it flew right and quickly vanished.  During the confusing of us talking the others just kinda vanish.   After I came inside, needless to say, I was pretty shook up at what I had seen.  I immediately google what I saw and seen several pictures and logs of the exact thing I seen.  Pretty weird 1st time I've ever seen something like this before.
