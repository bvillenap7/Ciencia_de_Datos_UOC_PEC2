Two strange lights with planes chasing over Greensboro, NC.;2005-11-18 22:35:00;30 Minutes;Two strange lights with planes chasing over Greensboro, NC. As I was driving home, I looked up into the sky and saw two strange bright lights.  These lights were moving very slowly, and there seemed to be a lot of planes out.  As one plane got extremely close to one of the lights, the light took straight off up and I couldn't find the plane or the other light again after this. It was very odd and it scared me a lot.;36.2019;-79.7100999999999
