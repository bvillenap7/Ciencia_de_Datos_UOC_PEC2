diamond*triangle ( couldnt tell) amber colored with greenish purple glow with lighting bolts coming off it.;2005-09-03 20:45:00;15mins;diamond*triangle ( couldnt tell) amber colored with greenish purple glow with lighting bolts coming off it. it was about 8*45 and i was about to take my girlfriend and other friends home. well as we got outside and i  said look its the north star but then we noticed it was not north and we check it, and it was west, then we thought it was a planet or a super nova.   But we notcied it was triangle/diamond shaped but hard to tell we thought it was morfing,with a amber color,had a strange greenish purple glows with lighting bolts coming off it.so we thought it was one of the two then as we left we notcied it was moving but we thought it was because when the car moves it looks like the stars move with you, but there not. then when we turned down anther road the tress cover it up. then after a few mins not seeing it, the object came over the trees right behind us moving left and right. right as it dissapeared the last time it was blinking red.;36.2019;-79.7100999999999
