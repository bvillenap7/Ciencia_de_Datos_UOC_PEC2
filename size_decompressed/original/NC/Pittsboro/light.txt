Facing east, almost due east at about a thirty to fourty degree angle a brilliant flash of light occurred. I am not stating this was a craft, but it was certainly unlike any meteor i have witnessed for several reasons: (one) it had no trail, but appeared as a brilliant flash (2)that faded. No colors really...No smoke, no noise, no residuals. slighty, into nothing. It could have been a star Nova!..i have no clue as to the distance...(3) the magnitude or luminescent--at least equal to the first magnitude star: Sirius,slightly less than Venus appears...  The thought occurred to me that it could have been a man-made satellite which was destroyed, or an exploded missile...Isn't anyone interested?...  My credentials as an objective, and clear-headed observor might be mentionedfor almost twenty years I was employed as a patent research specialist, examining drawings and diagrams at quite rapid speeds my judgements  and analysis based upon my perceptions of what i discerned fulfilled my vocation...;35.7696999999999;-79.1769999999998

Last week, (i wrote down somewhere the exact date), I lay outside on the lawnchair and gazed at the night sky. I adore the magic of clouds and stars and the feelings that come to me...Anyway, i was gazing into the eastern sky, unobstructed by any trees, when a brilliant Flash occurred at a forty-five degree angle. The distance is indeterminant but it must have been very, very far because it was silent and  yet quite large--far larger than either Sirius, the brightest star, or venus the planet.

Bright light with irregular flight pattern and speed.;2015-12-08 21:00:00;5 minutes;Bright light with irregular flight pattern and speed. Light, comparable to a commercial jets headlights when they are flying towards you to the northwest of my location, 10-15 degrees above the horizon.  Stood still for about 1 minute, then began heading right, stopped, went up and did a circle vertical to the ground.  Went right about 15 degrees, instantly went back to the left and disappeared, speed was about twice as fast as you would see a jet flying over at high altitude, kept same light brightness, looked at it through a rifle scope and could only see a light, not sure about distance but I was in an 80 acre field in the rural country and seemed to be very far off.;35.7696999999999;-79.1769999999998

I am only reporting this in case someone who got a better look does also so that their case has more validity.    We saw a bright red light above the tree line.  It appeared too large to be a plane and it was not blinking.   I apologize for the vagueness and realize it could be a million different man-made things.;35.7696999999999;-79.1769999999998
Very bright light covering my bathroom skylight.;2018-07-05 04:12:00;10 minutes;Very bright light covering my bathroom skylight. On the morning of July 5, 2018, approximately at 4.12 am I woke up as usual to go use a bathroom.  As I sat on my bed, I saw a BRIGHT light coming from the sky lights in my bathroom to by bedroom.  My bathroom is in my bedroom.  The light went all the way behind a corner in my bedroom and created a rectangle.  I was puzzled but I got up and went into the bathroom to look what was going on.  As I walked into the bathroom I saw VERY sharp and bright light right above the sky light.  I had to shield my eyes from the brightness. I could see only sharp blue/white light covering the whole window.  It reminded me movies about aliens where people have to shield their eyes because of the brightness.  However, I lost the next 10 minutes.  I only remember waking up and sitting back on my bed.  Still looking at the bright light.  I turned my back to it and went to sleep.  This whole time my inner voice was telling me to 'just go to sleep'.  I woke up to go to work at 5.20 am and the light was gone.  I have no idea why I did not wake my husband up or did not take pictures.  I just had this very happy feeling. On July 6th, 2018, at 4.23 am the light was there again, but in distance.  It was not covering my window.  This time I took pictures. first I thought it was a full moon, however, on July 8, 2018 I took a picture of the moon and found out that it was not full moon.;35.7696999999999;-79.1769999999998
