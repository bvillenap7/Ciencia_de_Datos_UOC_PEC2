4 white spheres, seen early night, over Jordan Lake, from corner of Andrews Store Rd. & Chapel Hill Rd.;1991-04-01 20:00:00;1-2 minutes;4 white spheres, seen early night, over Jordan Lake, from corner of Andrews Store Rd. & Chapel Hill Rd. I was going for ride with ex-husband.  We lived on Jack Bennett st., and we had stopped in Cruizer’s gas state for the car to get gas, and husband to get cup of coffee.  It was a clear night, no nasty weather.  I was sitting at the entrance of the gas state, waiting for the road to be clear (going to make a right hand turn onto Chapel Hill Rd.), and while I was waiting I just looked up at the sky and noticed the 4 lights.  They were: one larger sphere (about twice as big as smaller ones) and 3 smaller ones that were in the positions of “7 o’clock”, “5 o’clock”, and “3 o’clock”, when compared the center large sphere.  They were glowing a perfect white that was nearly bluish, and weren’t flashing, only had that strange flickering as though the air between us was moving their light.  The center sphere stood perfectly still, as did the one at 7-o’clock but the other 2 had a strange way that they were moving towards each other:  one second they were motionless, then they disappeared and then one second later were glowing again, only they were barely closer together.  They continued to flash closer like this for a minute or so.  I pointed them out to the husband, was like “huh… do you see that? What the hell are they.”  He said, “huh!” as well, but we honestly didn’t think too much about them, just made our right onto Chapel Hill Rd., and went for our drive.  I know they are un-flashy, but I can never figure out what they were. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.7696999999999;-79.1769999999998
