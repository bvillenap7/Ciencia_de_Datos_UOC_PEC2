Glowing Green Sphere in sky in Western NC;2011-11-25 18:20:00;5 seconds;Glowing Green Sphere in sky in Western NC I was heading home from work last night, traveling down Green Mountain heading towards Relief.  I'd say I was about halfway between the Green Mountain Post Office and the bridge that crosses the Toe River which separates Yancey and Mitchell County.   It's already totally dark outside, and being a rural area the only light comes from the occasional house and any trains that might be passing - the tracks are on the other side of the river.  But there were no trains last night during my drive. An object in the sky over across the river catches my eye, a bright, round, greenish-white ball which is moving somewhat slowly.  My first thought was along the lines of Roman Candle? I can't recall if it really seemed to be moving in an arc like the firework would, or if my mind was playing tricks with me because that was the only thing that made sense at that moment. But then, just seconds later it disappeared, with an effect not unlike ships jumping into Hyperspace in the Star Wars movies.  It was there, then it seemed to zip away and just vanish.  At this point I had come to a complete stop in the road, but didn't see anything else out of the ordinary.;35.9953;-82.2593
