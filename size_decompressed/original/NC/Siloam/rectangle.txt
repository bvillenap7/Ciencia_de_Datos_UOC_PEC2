Larger black rectangular object followed by weather phenomenon in North Carolina.;2019-10-27 00:00:00;30 seconds;Larger black rectangular object followed by weather phenomenon in North Carolina. Approximately midnight.  Visibility was fair.  I was sitting on my porch and weather was clear.  Abruptly while I was on my phone and not observing the sky, a sudden matte darkness took over the sky and a rush of constant dumping rain occurred for about 20-30 seconds.  Afterwards the rain stopped and the sky began to clear swiftly, but not from clouds, but from an obvious craft at an unknown height, rectangular or square in shape, low.  I saw the edge as it exposed the sky above.  No sound, no lights.  It just left and was almost like pulling the shade on a window.  This is almost a year removed to a report I posted in Banner Elk NC of a football sized craft.  I am around 90 miles away from that incident. I do note that my head is extremely foggy today, and I have no recollection of going to bed but that could just be chalked up to a long work week.  No drugs or alcohol involved.;36.3019;-80.5727
