I like watching thunderstorms, so I got up, and went out to back deck. It was raining hard, and lightning, but I wasn't getting too wet.  As I was looking toward my detached garage above and behind my garage, which was about 50 feet from me a oblong bright blue/white object appeared . It looked like it came out of a portal . It hovered there for about 5-8 minutes.  Then it started to descend slowly.  I'm the kind of person that would grab my phone, and run out to take photos.  That didn't happen, or my memory was wiped clean. I woke Saturday morning, and decided to cut my grass.  I'm 68 years old, and work 10 hours a day 5 days a week. Monday through Friday.  It's hard for me to keep up with outside work.  The grass needed cut bad, so I started cutting.  When I got to the back yard I saw the high grass had a depression about 12 feet by 12 feet.  I got my phone out, and took pictures.  When I first saw the depression, I remembered the sighting the night before.  I looked for steps or prints leading to, and/or from the depression, but saw none.  Monday I called WRAL news Raleigh,NC, and asked if they had had other reports.  They said no, and asked me to text the pictures along with my info, so I did.;36.0558000000001;-78.2612000000002
