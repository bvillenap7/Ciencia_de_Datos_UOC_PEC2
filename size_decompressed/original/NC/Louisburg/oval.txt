Dimly-lit objects seen racing over north carolina sky;2011-01-29 19:30:00;8-10 sec;Dimly-lit objects seen racing over north carolina sky Clear, star-filled sky. Was outside in the driveway smoking a cig, looking at Orion.  I observed two oval/rice-shaped objects moving at a high speed, south to north, in a straight and parallel formation. One of the objects accelerated a short distace ahead, and the other caught up immediately. When the second object caught-up with the other, the first again accelerated to what would appear to be the same distance ahead of the other.  The second object again caught-up to the first.  Both flight-paths were side-by-side and looked almost like they were on rails.  This was all within a few short seconds and both objects were moving continuously fast the whole time.  Faster than a jet seen from the NE sky shortly thereafter.  They were last seen leaving over the northern horizon. Both objects were identical and had well-defined edges.  Silvery and white.  Not brilliant, almost dim  They had defined edges were to perfect to be a shooting star.  The intensity of the lights never changed.;36.0558000000001;-78.2612000000002
