At 9:24pm on August 31, 2011, I went outside for some fresh air.  While in my front yard I looked up at the stars for awhile.  I looked towards the west at the Big Dipper, and noticed a star that began moving west to east.  It passed through the Big Dipper between where the handle and pot meet, or between the 3'rd star of the handle, and the 4'th star (where pot starts).  It continued to come closer to me, and as it did it became bright, then back to the brightness of the rest of the stars, and bright again.  It continued to get bright and normal bright as it got closer to me.  It almost was overhead when another light crossed behind it going south to north.  This one changed colors, red, white, yellow, blue, not necessarily in that order.  This one was smaller compared to the white light I first observed.  After the smaller one crossed behind the white object that remembled a star moving, the white round object simply disappeared!  It was if it turned off i! t's white light.  The smaller round object disappear about the same time.;36.0558000000001;-78.2612000000002

UFO sighted near Louisburg, NC moving north to south at a very high speed.;2013-10-03 21:00:00;3 seconds;UFO sighted near Louisburg, NC moving north to south at a very high speed. I took my dogs outside to do their business in our fenced in yard between 20:30 and 21:00, and while I was facing east a bright light caught my eye so I looked up.  I saw a very bright white light with a contrail moving north to south at a very high speed.  The object was round, and the contrail had no fragments falling from it just a straight contrail, which was very bright white light also.  The sighting lasted 3 seconds from the time it caught my eye.  The object was the size of a sweet pea. I am ex-Coast Guard, and we were taught to distinguish between lights.  I have seen falling space debris streak across the sky with contrails that had fragments falling from the tail.  This was not falling space debris.  The sky was clear with no clouds, and the object emitted no sound.;36.0558000000001;-78.2612000000002

I saw a star moving north to south through the Little Dipper handle, and then disappeared, but then a second star chasing it.;2014-04-24 04:30:00;30 seconds;I saw a star moving north to south through the Little Dipper handle, and then disappeared, but then a second star chasing it. I was outside drinking a cup of coffee, and looking at the stars 4:30 in the morning.  I noticed an airplane flying northeast, and then a star appeared behind it moving north to south.   The airplane and the star were located in the handle of the Little Dipper, and the moving star moved from the part of the handle closet to the pan towards the end of the handle, but to the east in parallel.   It was the same size as the stars in the Little Dipper.   The star was moving faster than the airplane, but not streaking across the sky.   It moved north to south for approximately 20 seconds then disappeared.   A second later I saw another star appear to the east of the first star, but this one had a yellowish color whereas the first star was white.   It seems to be chasing the white star then it too vanished after about 5 seconds.;36.0558000000001;-78.2612000000002
4 UFOs seen within a half an hour appearing and then vanishing.;2014-04-27 04:40:00;30 minutes;4 UFOs seen within a half an hour appearing and then vanishing. I woke at 04:25 for some reason, and was compelled to go outside to look at the sky.   At ~04:40, I saw a star appear almost overhead moving from the northeast to the southwest.  I brought my binoculars along this time, because I witnessed UFOs only a few days ago.  The object was circular, white, and had no blinking lights.  It moved across the clear sky for ~10 seconds then vanished.   Only a few seconds later a second star appeared it too being white, circular, and had no other lights.  It appeared almost in the same place as the first UFO, but moved from the north to the south. It moved for ~ 5 seconds then vanished.   All the UFOs moved about the same speed, which was faster than an aircraft, but not streaking, and made no sound.   A few minutes passed, and yet another star appeared from the same location, and moved from the northwest to the southeast.  It was the same size, color, and shape as the previous UFOs. This one moved for ~ 10 seconds then vanished.!   At exactly 05:10, (I checked my watch) another UFO appeared from a different location, but close to the others.  It was white, circular, and about the size of a star as were the previous three.  It too appeared from overhead just like the previous three, but moved west to east.  This UFO moved across the sky till I could not see it anymore.  It did not vanish.  There were no aircraft seen during these sightings, but I saw 2 shooting stars.   I enclosed a drawing to help explain my sights.;36.0558000000001;-78.2612000000002
