I returned home to Louisburg from Raleigh at around midnight and upon exiting the car saw a huge black triangular object moving from the Southwest to the Northeast. It appeared to be extremely large but was hard to gauge since it was very dark. It had lights around each side of the triangle, about 6 to a side as I recall and one at each point. It made no discernible sound and I would have definitely have heard something if it were a plane since I lived out in the country and it was extremely quiet there. It simply just flew overhead and disappeared on the horizon at the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.0558000000001;-78.2612000000002

I believe the triangle craft to be man made and not alien.;36.0558000000001;-78.2612000000002
