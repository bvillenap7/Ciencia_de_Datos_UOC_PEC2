A slow moving white and pale orange pulsating spherical object flying over Hamlet, NC.;2013-01-11 07:30:00;2 minutes;A slow moving white and pale orange pulsating spherical object flying over Hamlet, NC. I stepped outside of my house to walk my dog in the evening. Since it was in the winter it was pretty dark outside.  Once we stepped outside of the porch light another light source caught my eye.  I looked up and a spherical shaped white/pale orange pulsating light on the other side of the trees across the street from my house.  it was completely silent and moved in a pattern that a plane or helicopter could not imitate.  it would move back and forth in periods of 3 before finally moving off towards the east going toward the town of Laurinburg at a slow pace before speeding up.  Growing up I have been taught how to recognize civilian and military aircraft during the day and night because we have a small local airport and a military base called Camp McCall nearby.  I can say with confidence that this sighting was something that i have never seen before.;34.8948;-79.6994
