Two lights moving slowly south while perfectly parrallel to eachother;2009-04-28 22:45:00;15 minutes;Two lights moving slowly south while perfectly parrallel to eachother As I proceeded down U.S. 74 East coming to the border of Richmond and Scotland county I noticed two lights to the north off the highway.  At first the lights were stationary and I believed them to be towers of some sort because of the lights perfectly spaced apart from each other and because of there close proximity to the ground. I continued down the highway at the posted speed limit until I noticed the lights beginning to move south crossing over the highway in front of me at about half of a miles distance from my location.  I also noticed a darkness between the two lights as it continued to cross the highway as if there was a mass between the two.  I immediately followed it south onto Guinns Mill Rd then Scotland County Line Rd and continued pursuing it at high speeds. Going through curves and valleys I kept track of the object at sporadic moments until I lost complete sight of it.  As I came to highway 381 I continued south and once again saw the two lights spaced in the sky heading south.  Once I reached the intersection of highway 381 and 79 I proceeded east on X-Way Rd until I could no longer see the lights.;34.8948;-79.6994
3 bright, red, blinking lights, flying low in the eastern sky, Hamlet, NC.;2016-08-16 21:30:00;2 minutes;3 bright, red, blinking lights, flying low in the eastern sky, Hamlet, NC. Spotted 3 red, bright, blinking lights low in eastern sky. Two of the lights were flying in formation heading South. The third light seemed to be catching up with the other two. Sighting was very brief.  Maybe 2 minutes as the lights passed behind the tall trees on the southern side of my yard. No discernible sound was heard.;34.8948;-79.6994
