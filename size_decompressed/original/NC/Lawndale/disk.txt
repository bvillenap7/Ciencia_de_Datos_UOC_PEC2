I saw 3 blue lights close together hovering over the treeline across the street.;2019-03-31 05:33:00;2 minutes;It was 5:33 in the morning. I woke up a hour before and stood outside on my porch.  There was nothing in the sky I looked on the ground and back up.  When I looked up I saw 3 blue lights close together hovering over the treeline across the street.  The middle light shone bright.  I started at it for a sec and then got scared so I ran inside grabbed a knife locked the door and turned out all the lights.  I went to my moms room she was asleep so I layed beside her.  I felt like something was trying to talk to me through brain waves.  I kept hearing the word zerk.  Ever since this morning when it happened I feel like my senses have heightened not to a super hero level but they have increases.;35.4488;-81.5351
