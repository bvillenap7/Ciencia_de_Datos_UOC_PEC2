Star Destroyer shaped ufo low in the night sky!;2009-05-17 22:00:00;5 minutes;Star Destroyer shaped ufo low in the night sky! One night, my wife and I were out on our back deck enjoying each others company, gazing at the stars. We noticed something rather odd. A star out of place, perhaps a jet liner. We do live near an airport and it's not uncommon to see lights from a jet high in the sky.  Sometimes even military aircraft go buzzing around making awful noise. I thought it was probably a jet.  It did not seem to move about at all, and it appeared far enough away to be a star. The object was blinking with red and white lights. We stared in awe wondering what it could be when all of a sudden. Like a star plucked from the sky it seemed to dive straight in at us at incredible speed.  Once it was close enough to make out, (which was within seconds) my wife frantically ran in the house scared.  I stared at it as it stopped and hovered maybe 150-200 yards above the ground, on my left side.  Right above my property. Not making a sound it moved at a slow speed across to my right side over and across the tree tops until out of sight. I saw the craft very clearly.  It was shaped kind of like a star destroyer from star wars but much smaller. I would guess its size could have taken up half a football feild.  Its color was a bluish grey, very dark.  The craft had a few very dim lit lights underneath of it.  The underneath was all I could really see.   Since the incident I've done alot of research on the web about ufo sightings and was glad to see that others have seen similar crafts. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
