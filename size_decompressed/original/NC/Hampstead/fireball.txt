FIREBALL LIKE OBJECT (LOOKS LIKE FLARE) Spotted in North Carolina;2004-01-31 19:00:00;3-5 seconds;FIREBALL LIKE OBJECT (LOOKS LIKE FLARE) Spotted in North Carolina On Saturday, January 31 at aprox. 7:00 p.m. me and my brother spotted a fireball in the sky.  We were playing Playstation when out of the corner of my brother's eye he spots something out the window.  I quickly glance over and see a flare-like object falling towards the ground.  I didn't think this was a meteor because it was to large to be a meteor that burned in the atmospere (unless this meteor didnt burn up much).  This object resembled a flare, but it couldn't have been that either due to flares having a longer light life.  This couldn't have been a firework due to it making no sound, I dont think it did anyway.  The object was seen just over the tree line less than a quarter mile away.  I am 12 years old and due believe in other life-forms but even a skeptical scientist would have a hard time explaaining this.  I went outside to check for anything on the ground as this appeared to have landed.  I looked with a flashlight and couldn't see anything.  In the morning i will check again and post something if i find anything on the ground.  As i was writing this i saw a flicker out of my left eye towards the window but i didn't have time to look.  This object was orangish-redish in appearance.  There are many other houses around also.  I will have my camera ready if i see anything again tonight.  I will report if I see anything else.;34.3914;-77.6597000000001
