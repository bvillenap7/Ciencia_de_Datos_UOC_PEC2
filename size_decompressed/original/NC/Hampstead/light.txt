It was approximately 8pm last evening, probably a few minutes before.  I was coming home from the grocery store and had opened my trunk to get the groceries.  The sky was beautiful with bright stars shining - no clouds.   I noticed what I first thought might be an airplane flying very high - it looked like it would be flying over the inner coastal waterway and then out over the ocean - just two blocks away.  It was moving quickly and it looked like a bright moving light in the sky - kind of like a plane with landing lights on - but it was way too high for landing lights.  When I stopped to watch it - curious - it stopped flying and hovered in the sky.  I could see it moving around-at first I thought it was turning to come inland, but it just hovered there - like a boat bobbing in the water.   I had this very strong negative feeling that I was not supposed to see it and that I should stop looking, so I went into the house.  I unpacked the two bags I'd brought in befor! e I went back out.  When I went to get the rest of my groceries, the bright like just looked like a start in the sky.  I would have never known that it was anything but a very bright star.;34.3914;-77.6597000000001

We stared at it for a few seconds, and then in a split second the oval shape changed to a straight light as it shot up into the sky.  We both said if we did not see it we wouldn't believe it!  We did not see any solid object in this incident.;34.3914;-77.6597000000001
