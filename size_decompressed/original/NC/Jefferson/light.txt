I saw a bright, orangish light about 35-40 degrees up from the horizon in the southern sky.  My first thought was that Mars was unusually low and bright.  I then thought I was seeing an evacuation helicopter moving toward Ashe Memorial Hospital, some 7 miles to the west and he had his spot light on for some reason.  I did not see any movement laterally, but it seemed to be growing, indicating that it was moving toward me.  As I watched the light, it turned off. I did not see any blinking aircraft lights to indicate that it was an aircraft that had turned off any landing or search lights.   It was a bright, orangish light, larger than a star or planet, that simply turned off in the sky.;36.4081;-81.4431
Bright star-like orb moving in sky.;2010-06-24 22:30:00;1 minute;Bright star-like orb moving in sky. My mother and I were standing on the back deck around 10:15 pm to 10:20 pm, looking at the sky, when what looked like a bright star appeared.  The night was cloudy, so we didn't think it was a star.  I guessed it was an airplane (although it seemed too far down to be one), because of it's slow moving nature, but there were no blinking lights, just one solid bright light.  As it moved across the sky, my pet dogs began barking and growling insanely towards the star-like object.   Then, as quickly as it apppeared, it faded away, as if flying out towards space.  About 20 to 30 minutes later, after my mother and I went inside, a helicopter flew over the house.   I suppose it was following the UFO.;36.4081;-81.4431
