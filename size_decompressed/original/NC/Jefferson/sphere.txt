Strange round object moving over fireworks display area;2010-07-04 21:00:00;2-5 minutes;Strange round object moving over fireworks display area We were waiting for the annual fireworks celebration when we noticed a round, reddish/orange light moving slowly in the clear evening sky.  It appeared to be the size of a large star.  It moved slowly and steadily, making no noise.   At first we thought it might be an airplane, but then we realized that it was stopping and starting periodically.  The light moved toward us as the fireworks began.  It seemed to hover over the area for several minutes and then slowly moved behind a patch of broken clouds.  Once the clouds cleared, the object was gone.  We did not see it again that evening. There were four people in our party that witnessed this strange object.  We watched it carefully, hoping for some logical explanation (airplane, helicopter, etc).  One member of our group firmly believes in UFO's.  The other three are skeptical, but remain convinced that we saw something special that evening.
