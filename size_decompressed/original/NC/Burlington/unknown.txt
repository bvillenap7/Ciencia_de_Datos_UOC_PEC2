A formation of brightly lit objects rise through the North Carolina night sky and disappear one by one.;2021-03-13 20:23:00;5-10 minutes;A formation of brightly lit objects rise through the North Carolina night sky and disappear one by one. On 3/13/21, I was outside in the backyard of our home with my wife, stepson, and a friend of ours. We were splitting and bfirewood into our friends truck when we noticed a group of lights as they became visible while rising from the top of the treeline to the west of us.  There were several objects that seemed to be moving slowly, in a loosely formed  formation. The objects appeared, to me, to be moving in a northeasterly direction while rising in altitude.  After a few minutes of observing, my stepson and friend each began video recording the objects with their cellphones. As the objects seemed to reach a certain altitude or position, they disappeared individually from our sight.;36.078682150695;-79.461848280908
