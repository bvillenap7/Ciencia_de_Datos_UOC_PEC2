My wife and I and our 3 children were leaving the movies.  My 11 year old son called attention to 5 red lights in the sky.  They were each evenly spaced and formed a perfect 45 degree angle.  They were very bright and much bigger than any star in the night sky.  I told him they could be flares.  Then I turned back to talk with my wife.  He said dad, can flares do that?  I looked back up and could not believe what we were witnessing.  Let's say the red lights were numbered 1 through 5, with 1 being the one on top.  Number 2 was moving independently horizontally to the west and stopped exactly opposite of where it had been in relation to number 1.  Then number 3 moved up to where number 2 had been.  So now number 1, 2 and 3 have formed a perfect symmetrical triangle.  Numbers 4 and 5 never moved.  The triangle started slowly moving to the west.  We noticed that when it passed over a star that the light from the star disappeared.  And as it kept moving the star reappeared.  As if the triangle had mass or something was going on in the middle that masked the light.  It eventually stopped and all 3 lights went out at the same time.  We quickly looked back and 4 and 5 were still just sitting there.  I'm using the tree line, even though they were much higher, as a reference.  One of the lights reappeared way up high in the north west part of the sky. In a blink of the eye it went back to position 3.  Not like a red streak.  But it just went from one spot to another.  Then in the lower north west sky another light appeared.  It too in the blink of an eye went to number 2's position.  Now there are 4 red lights forming the 45 degree angle.  The 5th light never came back.  One by one in no particular order they went out.   My children were a little upset, thinking aliens were coming.  But I reassured them that we know God made our universe and everything in it.  And we should feel good that God let us see something so special that He made. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  It is unclear to us whether the date of the sighting was August 15, or September 15.  The witness indicates both months above.  PD));36.078682150695;-79.461848280908
Cluster of moving lights.;2014-12-11 22:00:00;45 minutes;Cluster of moving lights. My wife and I, on the night of Dec 11th, around 9 PM to about 10 PM, watched a formation of lights.  We live north of Burlington, NC.  The lights were to the south southeast at about 4 o’clock high.   They moved around slightly and in a tight formation and were flickering.  I watched one drop down a ways then went back up to the others.  They stayed in the same place all the time.   I called the sheriff’s office and reported it.  They said they had no other reports but would look into it.  Never heard back from them.  We know what we saw were not airplanes.  Not unless the fly in one place for almost an hour.  No doubt they were very high up.  Then all of a sudden, they disappeared. Bound to have been seen by others. Thanks;36.078682150695;-79.461848280908
On Thursday, 10/08/15 my husband was driving home after being in a conference in Durham nc through a small town by the name of  Mebane.;2015-10-08 23:00:00;2 days;On Thursday 10-08-15, my husband was driving home after being in a conference in Durham, nc, through a small town by the name of  Mebane.  He stopped at a exit where there was a gas station still open.  He said he pulled in and saw several people staring across the street toward the sky.  When he came out he realized that everyone was staring  a dark object surround by blurry white light engulfed in a orangish-pink light.  my husband, who is a skeptic about all things unexplained, decided it was some sort of jet/airplane, until the light began to appear to move very slowly in a back and forth motion.   He claimed the he was still able to see the light until he reached Greensboro city limits.  When he came home and told me about what he saw and I  immediately wanted to go back and take a few pictures.  I grabbed my phone and we went back the same route he went.  It appeared to have been gone, so we turned around to head back home.  We took a back route through G! reensboro and we came upon tow cars parked almost in the middle of a lane. There it was.  Clear as  you can imagine.  My husbands description was fairly accurate except I wouldn't say it was moving back and forth.  I would describe it as more of a hoover, a bob like motion.  I took my camera out and although my phone didn't get the best shot, it is evident that whatever it was definitely moving, very slowly and it was not an aircraft that we are used to hear.  There was also an older couple who own a  bar a few feet from where we stopped who came out and said they had someone call the police and worker were being drilled by the operator.  He was adamant that they knew something was going on and wanted to know who saw it.  I hope someone steps forward and explains this, I've had no sleep and I can't stop searching the sky's for another one.;36.078682150695;-79.461848280908

A stationary green light dove to the ground and disappeared.;2019-01-09 06:36:00;5 seconds;A stationary green light dove to the ground and disappeared. I was on the way to work and at mile marker 135, heading east on 85N.  To the ENE, I noticed a green stationary light that was brighter than any visible star, and was the only light in the sky in the pre-dawn.  As I was observing the light, it began to dive at an angle toward the ground at a high rate of speed, and faded very quickly to nothing as it neared the ground.  The entire experience lasted around five seconds and was over.   I do not drink or use recreational drugs, and was on my way to work when I saw it.  I’ve lived in four states on both coasts and this is the first object I’ve seen whose anomalous nature I’m confident enough to actually report.  I watch the sky often, as I am interested in astronomy and enjoy thinking about the cosmos, and I’ve never seen anything like this.  I would say it could have been a meteorite, but it started out stationary and was a bright green color.;36.078682150695;-79.461848280908
Two bright white lights low in the atmosphere over North Carolina.;2019-02-09 18:45:00;5-10 minutes;Two bright white lights low in the atmosphere over North Carolina. I was out with my dogs in the evening, being the sky-watcher that I am I noticed it is a mostly clear evening and two stationary really bright non-flashing white lights to the east. I watch the lights for minute or two then they start moving, one to the east, the other to the west. I also notice there is an airplane with it's flashing lights at a much, much higher altitude moving to the north east. The bright lights move a good distance from each other then stop. At this time I can only see the light that moved west.  After coming to a stop it seemed to get smaller and smaller. I watched it for about 10 minutes before having to go back inside.;36.078682150695;-79.461848280908
