I had a strong feeling not to discuss this sight with anyone, as interesting and astounding to me as it was. While riding home from middle school in the backseat of a Volkswagon Beetle I was gazing out the rear window of the car when I saw a silvery perfectly round object that resembled a full moon rising steadily against a gray overcast sky.  There was no rain occuring, just a dry overcast gray day.  At that time, I was thirteen years old.  I knew that what I saw was not a weather balloon, due to the fact that my father, a small aircraft pilot, had taken me numerous times to the local airport to view weather balloon launches, and I was very familiar with all that weather balloons involve, both visually and mechanically. While watching this object for about thirty seconds, I felt that I was not intended to see it, and I made what I felt was a conscious decision to never discuss what I had seen.  I noticed the object ascending from the East, and I watched it with apprehension until the vehicle in which I was riding turned a corner and went down a hill towards my home, and my view was blocked by landscape and trees..  When I first noticed the silver circle it was about 20 degrees about the visible horizon, when I lost sight of it thirty seconds later it was in what I would consider the 11:00 AM position, but not overhead, still east of me. To the east of my sighting location there was no developments, airports, cities, etc.-- just rural area. The object seemed to be very close in proximity and relatively the size of a full moon, and metallic-- silver in color.  Twenty-seven years later, I can still visualize and feel exactly what I witnessed in 1971, and I still have an eerie feeling when I think about it, whic is mostly all the time.;36.078682150695;-79.461848280908
The object was bright and made a left turn then started to ascend and pick up speed and shot upward and disappeard from view.;2007-01-03 18:15:00;1 minute;The object was bright and made a left turn then started to ascend and pick up speed and shot upward and disappeard from view. We were looking at the sky and saw this white oval object in the NW sky heading towars the NE.  At first we thought it might be the Internation Space Station but it was a little smaller (we had just seen the ISS a couple weeks ago when it had passed over our city).  We continued to watch the object and then it started to make a left turn and start to ascend and then pick up speed and shot upward and then disappeared out of sight.;36.078682150695;-79.461848280908

Upward curving row or lights flying low over interstate 85 NC.;2013-11-26 20:30:00;15 seconds;Upward curving row or lights flying low over interstate 85 NC Driving North on interstate 85 NC around mile marker 147.  A line of white and yellow lights crossed the highway very low and only had one other light which was higher than the others but the shape of the object could not be seen.  It slightly rocked forward and back once while passing over the road and continued from west to east until we drove further and it was out of sight.  More cars were on the interstate but none seemed to slow down or be concerned with it.  It seemed to be too many lights to be an airplane which usually don't have that many lights in a singular upward curving row or be that low flying.;36.078682150695;-79.461848280908
