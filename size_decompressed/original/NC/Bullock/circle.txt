I was standing with my father on the bank of Grassy Creek (Kerr Lake on NC & VA border) in Bullock, NC, when we saw a large, fast moving, bright white light approaching from the East, heading South West at about 50 degrees in the sky.  I made the comment to my father that it was really moving fast, but there was no sound coming from it.   As we were watching the object, it suddenly separated into three individual white lights, and within a second of separation, all of the lights totally disappeared.  Vanished!!!   We stood there in awe and asked each other…Did you see that?  What was that?”  Holy ((1 word deleted))! – I have never seen anything like that in the 50 years that I've been alive.;36.5075;-78.5679
