Large red glowing light moved across sky and disappeared.;2011-07-16 22:35:00;3 minutes;Large red glowing light moved across sky and disappeared. July 16, 2011, at approximately 10:35 pm, my husband was walking the dog and came to the front door to tell us to run out to see the red glowing light in the sky.  He and our daughters had seen the red glowing light on the night of July 14th, 2011, as well and had told me about it.  Now was my chance to see it for myself.   We ran out the front door of our home in Conover, North Carolina.  At about 10:35-10:39 pm, the large red glowing light moved across the southern sky moving in a south-westerly direction.  It was undoubtedly red and about twice the size of a large star or planet.  It moved steadily and straight.   Then the light slowly began to dim and shrink until it disappeared.  Unbelievable.  I thought it must be an airplane, as I have seen the headlights look very large if they are coming directly at me, but I have never seen them red and I have never seen them get smaller and smaller the way this happened.;35.7313;-81.2165000000001
Sighted 3 red and white crafts moving back and forth quickly in the sky without sound in Hickory, and friends in Salisbury saw too.;2012-10-02 21:00:00;15 minutes;Sighted 3 red and white crafts moving back and forth quickly in the sky without sound in Hickory, and friends in Salisbury saw too. Called from a family member in Salisbury, NC, and told to look into the sky, we saw three objects in the sky.  The family member who called had their neighbors watching it as well.  We assumed they were planes until we realized they made no sound, and instead of heading in a certain direction, they continued to fly back and forth continuously.  One of them flashed a white light erratically, while the tho others had three lights, the front two flashing white and the back one flashing red.  After a while, one the unidentified objects began to come closer and the crafts moved farther away from each other.  We don't know anything about aircrafts, but it would be bizarre if planes mere moving back and forth from left to right, being that size without sound.  It was also extremely bizarre that nearly an hour away in Salisbury, our two family members could see the same exact sight.  A few minutes after the craft disappeared, a large red and green, triangular craft was in the area that was not there before, but we could hear it.
