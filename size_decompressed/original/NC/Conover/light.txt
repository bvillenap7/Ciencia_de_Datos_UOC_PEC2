white light hovering, glowing, and disappearing.;2009-12-02 21:00:00;3 minutes;white light hovering, glowing, and disappearing. I was standing on my front porch facing south when I saw a white light ( no flashing air craft lights, only a solid white light brighter than any star) float slowly in the sky over the tree line in front of me, moving west to east. When the light got into about the center of my vision it stopped moving entirely for approximately 1 minute and appeared to hover. The light started to grow brighter after this time and almost became yellow in color. The object then slowly started to climb in the air vertically about the length that it had moved from west to east upon seeing it initially. The object then went out extremely fast and was gone.

Two VERY BRIGHT,individual craft lights in a horizontal pattern, were hovering, soundless.  Green,red and white lights continued in flashing.   As known aircraft would enter the area, much higher than the 2 crafts, they disappeared to the east very quickly.  Then returned from the south west.  At one point there were 3 crafts in a V shape flying pattern.  My daughter shot a video of the event on her phone.;35.7313;-81.2165000000001
