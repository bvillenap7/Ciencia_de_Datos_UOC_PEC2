When I asked them to look up they refused to watch. I compared it with a plane flying north on the opposite direction, it was not flying as high as the plane. It had a cylindrical shape divided by 3-4 rings the whole object was silver. 7:35 Bright Blue sky, no clouds. Silver object bigger and wider than a plane. Shape of a cylinder, it was divided in 3-4 sections. My friends refused to check. IKt was not traveling as fast as a plane. After trying to convince my friends to look I saw an airplane flying higher and faster in the opposite direction. When I turne around the object was gone. If I try to calculate the time of the trayectory it could have been between 2-3 minutes.;36.4485999999999;-77.6738000000002
