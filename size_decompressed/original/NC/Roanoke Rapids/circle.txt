Three bright lights surrounded by four to five small red lights flying independently Roanoke Rapids North Carolina;2018-02-09 18:00:00;10-15 minutes;Three bright lights surrounded by four to five small red lights flying independently Roanoke Rapids North Carolina I was sitting in my chair watching TV and talking to a friend of mine I just hung up with on the phone when the lights appeared over the tree line coming from the town of Roanoke Rapids they lights popped on really bright had 4 red lights small and moving around it and almost like a triangle pattern the bright lights the three white yellowish lights in the middle or oil type together and they were extremely bright as they passed over my house they lit up my entire yard at the time I couldn't get up out of my chair because I have a bad leg to observe it from outside.  My next door neighbor said she heard it fly over and it was extremely loud I didn't hear any sound.  It flew off in the direction of the old airport that we have here.  The three lights in the middle seem to be extremely large about the size of a blimp  Maybe but the little red lights on the sides and around it did not seem like they were attached to the object at all it will moving independently.;36.4485999999999;-77.6738000000002
