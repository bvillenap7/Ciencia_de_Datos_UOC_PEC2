Loud egg shaped aircraft.;2014-04-15 17:45:00;10-15 seconds;loud egg shaped aircraft Around 5:45 pm on Tuesday, April 15th, 2014, as I make dinner for my family we heard a loud jet sound pass.  I yelled out,what was that?   My 10 yr old daughter went out on the front porch and came back in and told me she didn't see anything.  Less than a minute later the sound goes over us again.  I looked out the small window in our kitchen and saw the trees swaying and just assumed it was the wind picking up and echoing in the mountains.   The 3rd time we hear it, I go out on the porch. It sounded like it was right above us but I saw nothing.  The sound was a deep rumbling and I couldn't tell what direction it was coming from.  The sound changed from a deep rumble to a higher pitch rumble.  Then I saw the craft come over our house, at what seemed to be the same altitude as a normal aircraft.  This craft however, was wingless and a dark grayish color.  Also, it was sort of egg shaped.  Not exactly like an egg, but it wasn't round either.  This thing moved f! ast like a jet but left no jet stream.  Right when I saw it, I yelled out for my family to come see. In a matter of seconds it was already almost out of sight.  I know how this sounds, but I cannot deny what I saw. I don't know if it was alien or government.  What I do know is, it was not a normal plane or jet.  I hope I'm not the only one to see this craft.;35.3482;-83.2028
