Triangle shaped object in WNC;2007-12-04 19:30:00;10 seconds;Triangle shaped object in WNC We were driving westbound on I40 toward Sylva on Balsam Mountain when my husband got my attention and pointed to the sky.  There was a slow moving triangular shaped object with a light in each corner that was a greenish color.  The craft was moving much slower than a plane and it was not hovering like a helicopter.  There were no flashing lights on the sides or under belly.  It is hard to know what the complete shape and dimensions would be because it was dark. The craft came towards us, passed over our vehicle ( there was no noise) and then continued on to the right.  We turned around a little father down to see if it was visible and had continued on the same path but it was gone;35.3482;-83.2028
