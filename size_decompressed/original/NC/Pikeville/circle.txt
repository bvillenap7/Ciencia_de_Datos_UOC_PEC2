Circle or tear drop white orb seen over Pikeville, NC.;2017-07-30 04:00:00;1 hour;Circle or tear drop white orb seen over Pikeville, NC. I was first alerted by my wife at 4am who noticed a bright white light that appeared artificial  in the shape of a circle or tear drop, it did not twinkle or look anything like a star or planet and was definitely not a plane or helicopter.  It stayed in one spot for.  Close to an hour and then appeared to gradually slip away. This object was very noticeable and as I said appeared to be artificial light such as from a craft not anything like a star or otherwise.;35.4937;-77.9624999999999
