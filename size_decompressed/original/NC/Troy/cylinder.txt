Cylindrical metallic object falling to earth;2017-01-12 20:00:00;20 seconds;Cylindrical metallic object falling to earth On Thursday night, January 12, 2017, as I was traveling south on highway 134, just about 5 miles outside of Troy, NC, I noticed a metallic cigar shape object falling straight down out of the sky.   It was a clear night with a full moon, so I could see the object clearly.   I drove past the object before it either hit the ground or whether it leveled out and flew away.   I called a friend who I call a sky watcher, and sure enough, she had spotted a bright burst of light, which then faded quickly over the city of Sofia.   Donâ€™t know if the two events are related or not. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.3777;-79.9093
