Two orange spheres were flying together before they joined back together and accelerated straight up into the sky and out of sight.;2010-12-14 18:45:00;5-10 minutes;Two orange spheres were flying together before they joined back together and accelerated straight up into the sky and out of sight. While driving down the road two orange objects caught my eye hovering over the local community college.  The objects were flying low, just above the tree line and flew in the same direction I was traveling.  I pulled my car over and observed the two orange lights begin to fly in separate, opposite directions.  After a moment one of the lights stopped and the other orange sphere began to move towards the other light. Both of the orange spheres appeared to release on object that resembled a shooting star.  They then joined together, with no apparent change in the size of the lights, and then they accelerated straight up into the night sky until they completely disappeared out of my sight. I am a lifetime resident of this county and had never before witnessed a UFO, but I firmly believe that this object was not of an Earthly origin.  Its actions and movements did not appear to resemble any plane or other flying object that I have witnessed.  I was stunned at what I had seen because it was an amazing incident that does not happen everyday.  I phoned a friend to tell him what I had observed and he directed me to report this sighting to youâ€™re website.
