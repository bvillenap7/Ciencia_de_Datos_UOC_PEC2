Hovering jet???;2018-03-31 20:00:00;1 hour;Hovering jet??? Around 8pm, I went outside to get groceries out of my car and noticed how big the moon was, so I decided to take a picture of it.  At that time two of my cats looked up to the sky towards the same direction of the moon and started going that way as if they seen something and were going to attack. As soon as I look to see what they are looking at my back porch light turned off.  I noticed blinking red and white lights at the same exact place above the tree line hovering just like 2 nights before when me and my husband thought it was a jet going over our house and stop and hovered there at the same exact spot but the previous night it only hovered for about 5 mins before moving again and going back around the same way it came only not directly over our house.  Also, then there seem to be another one on the direct opposite side hovering and when that one started moving the other just kinda disappeared. But last night was different I only seen that one hovering with blinking red and white lights.  I watched it for like 5 or 10 minutes outside then I went in and went to my front door to look out and it seemed to go up and then back to the same spot.  My husband was on the way home and by time he got there in a 30 minute period it had move a little above where it was and the lights had stopped blinking, it then looked like any other star in the sky, but I know it wasn't just a star.  Once my husband got home and I walked outside the back porch light was back on.  I'd say it was there for another 10 to 20 minutes when I looked out again it was gone.;35.6789;-77.6382
