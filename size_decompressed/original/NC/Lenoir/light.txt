Blinking lights have been appearing and hovering over the blue ridge mountains.  ((anonymous reports));2018-12-24 22:30:00;Ongoing;Blinking lights have been appearing and hovering over the blue ridge mountains.  They occasionally move higher and higher until they can no longer be seen from the window frame without bending down.  They're gone by 11PM every night.   Last night they returned.  In the wee hours of the morning.  I'm not sure of the time.  I woke up briefly and noticed because it was brighter.  Bigger.  The blinking lights were clearer.  It was also farther to the left this time.  I wake  up a lot every night.  This is the first time I've seen them return.   This was viewed from the village of Cedar Rock.;35.9188947635133;-81.5402597972977
