Saw UFO;1976-06-30 20:30:00;45 minutes;Saw UFO My brother and I were out side talking when we heard all the dogs in the neighborhood begin barking and howling.  We then saw a strange lights hovering and moving in a straight up and down movement and side to side unlike any normal aircraft is capable of.  We were at my father's farmland.  All the cattle came running off the hillside and trying to alll squeeze in the barn at once.  Lights appeared on an aircraft that was cylinder iCal and had lights that were multi colored.  The airship descended with a straight downward motion.  It caused a lot of movement of air. .  We were afraid to approach.  We went inside to get my father.  He thought we were joking.  We waited for what seemed about 30 mins and then began to approach the aircraft.  When we got within around 100 yard the aircraft began to ascend.  It ascended straight up into the sky.  We walked up to the area it had been but because it was dark we couldnâ€™t see anything.   The following day we walked up to the area it! hand landed and we were shocked to see a large ring burned into the grass and ground in a circular pattern.  We showed my father and he was astonished.  There is no explanation for what we saw.   This happened in Lenoir, NC.  Neighbors reported seeing fire balls in this area for a long time. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, who corrected the time of the sighting.  PD));35.9188947635133;-81.5402597972977
