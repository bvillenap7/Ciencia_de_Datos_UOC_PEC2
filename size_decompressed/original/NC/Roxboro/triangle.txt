Triangular craft flying under 1000 ft and under 100mph RED LIGHT AT CENTER;2013-06-23 22:30:00;20 seconds;Triangular craft flying under 1000 ft and under 100mph RED LIGHT AT CENTER I live in rural NC and do not live near an airport and although there is a military outfit in the area there is not a base I am aware of.   A few nights back I stepped out per usual to have a cigarette before retiring for the night.  It was roughly between 10:30 and 11 pm.  This night in particular was nothing out of the norm.  My mother joined me moments later for a smoke and we talked while gazing at stars and hunting satellites.   We hadn't been out long when we heard what sounded to be a very distant jet engine but became a low rumbling roar and I could feel the vibrations as I stood gazing skyward.  The UFO appeared mere moments later and was due south from my position and flew West to East.   The craft was approximately no more than half a mile away and was easily bigger than my house and seemed to defy gravity by moving so slow.   The event lasted no more than 20 seconds as the object soon disappeared behind the trees but I saw two very large yellow/white lights ! (one on the crafts nose, the other on the left wing) and at what looked to be at the heart of the ship was a large red light and the three said lights gave of a unwavering glow.   I assume that the right wing would also have had a yellow/white light and this vehicle matches several descriptions I have read previously.  My mother saw less of the craft than I did but she is still astute that it was unnatural.   I felt compelled to post this as this is my second encounter with an UFO. Less than ten years ago, and not but roughly ten miles from where I currently reside, a very slow and low flying, triangular craft black in color flew over my house and my family and I assumed it was a B-2 spirit but there were supposedly only 20 made.  The craft from that summer night in my youth had many lights on the bottom and was only a couple hundred feet over the tree tops.   A B-2 bomber's slowest flying speed is 140, right? It took until I was older to realize that what had flown over that night was flying well under 100mph because the tree tops only swayed mildly.
