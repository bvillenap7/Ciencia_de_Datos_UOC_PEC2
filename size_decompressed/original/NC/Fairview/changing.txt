UFO sightings in the eastern sky.;2004-12-21 04:30:00;2 hours;UFO sightings in the eastern sky. In the eastern sky we observed a total of what appeared to be three ufo's that  changed in shape and size.  We documented this event via camcorder for approx. 1 hour 30 mins.  The largest ufo appeared yellowish in color around the perimeter and had a redish center.  The two smaller ufo's where mainly red in color and were only visible for a 10 min period. The objects often moved and changed shapes and sizes.  The larger ufo at times resembled the moon, other times it would appear to break apart into multi objects and other times it appeared to rotate into the shape of a half moon.  This sighting was clearly the most out of this world my family has ever had.;35.5211;-82.391
