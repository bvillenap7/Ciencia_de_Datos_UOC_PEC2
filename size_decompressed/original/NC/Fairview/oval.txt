My daughter, 15, and I observed the spacecraft from our house and then the yard.  Through the trees, a large white light slowly rose vertically from the ground.  It was probably rising from an open area or road on the other side of the trees, as opposed to being right in the woods.  We heard a faint engine sound.   It hesitated above the tree line and slowly headed over our house and mountain.  It was ascending at the same time.  Looking at it from underneath, it wasnâ€™t a huge white light anymore.  It was oval with 2 sets of lights underneath, red and white.  There were fainter lights around the circumference, because we could see it was oval.  In 2001, when my daughter was 8, she saw another oval craft fly over our house.  It was more intricate with more lights and colors on it.;35.5211;-82.391
