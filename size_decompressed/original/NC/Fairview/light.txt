6 lights in sky over my house very loud humming sound;2014-07-16 21:20:00;2 minutes;6 lights in sky over my house very loud humming sound I just saw 6 lights flying in a straight line high up in the sky directly overhead. I heard a very loud humming sound and it got so loud it was shaking the house.   They were in a perfectly straight line moving either in sequence unless it was one object.   From the height in the sky I would estimate it was at least a mile or more in length from the front light to the tail.;35.5211;-82.391
