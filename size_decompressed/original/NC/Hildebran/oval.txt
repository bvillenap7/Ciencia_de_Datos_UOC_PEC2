4 very large disk shaped object moving slowly in coordinated formations one with streaming sparks emitted from the bottom. 11/3/06;2006-11-03 19:30:00;10 minutes;4 very large disk shaped object moving slowly in coordinated formations one with streaming sparks emitted from the bottom. 11/3/06 Four Large disc shaped objects about as bright as a full moon, they appeared to be about 75 to 100' wide and moved very slowly first in straight line formation then they spread a part and seem to be about 100 yards apart. One appeared to have long sparks streaming down from it and began losing altitude and disappeared behind the trees as I tried to follow them down a road ajacent to Interstate 40 and exit 113 (connelly springs rd). I turned around back to I-40 and noticed a car and two individuals standing by it and I stopped and jokingly asked them if they'd seen any UFO's come by and they said YEAH you saw them too? and were excited and seemed to be relieved that someone else had seen them. They described exactly what I had seen and then said we were afraid you were with the government and had come by to to arrest them or something I laughed and told them I don't believe in UFO's but I had just seen some. I drove away toward home.... I'm a 50 year old devout Christian man and a IT Technician. I don't know the background  of the other two young men in their 20's who witnessed this phenomenon.
