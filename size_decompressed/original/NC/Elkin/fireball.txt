I know they must use I77 as a guide to navigate. I was also looking at the Big Dimmer. Starting and the upper most part of the handle and coming down to the 4th. star which starts the formation of the dipper part itself, I saw a bright ball of light traveling at a fast pace from the South West , traveling to the North East. It passed what appeared to be straight over the 4th. star in the dipper and sent for about five seconds and stopped abruptly. All total it lasted for ten seconds, traveling from my left to my right in what appeared to be the same distance on each side of the 4th. star in the dipper. It stopped just as fast as it started. The night was totally claear and I could see Jet liners with their flashing clearance lights moving in different directions. The object I saw was traveling perfectly horiziontally and left no tail . It was there and then it was gone.;36.2867000000001;-80.8599999999999
