Triangle formation as storm approached;2012-09-01 17:10:00;seconds;triangle formation as storm approached A thunderstorm was approaching from the NW and flashes of lightning could be seen.  I stepped out of my shop to observe and immediately after a flash of lightning i saw 10 black or dark objects in a triangle formation,4 on top,3 on next level,then 2 then 1. The objects disappeared quickly after the flash.  At first I attributed the objects to my eyes being affected by the flash but then 8 seconds later another flash of lightning occurred and the same formation appeared close to where the previous formation was sighted.  Both sightings were near the top of well-known lone mountain with flat terrain on all sides. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
