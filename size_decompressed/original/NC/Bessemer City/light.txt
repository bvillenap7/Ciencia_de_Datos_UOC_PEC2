I was looking up at the stars. It was just getting dark enough to see them. Stars are very bright white lights. Then I saw what I thought was a star just started kind of like dancing. It shot up and down left and right at Incredible speeds. It could stop on a dime as if it was putting on a show. It could not be a bug, a plane or Something shooting through the atmosphere. I am a business man. I donâ€™t do drinking or drugs. It was a Extraterrestrial show. It finished its show with a grand finale. It shot off at the end thousands of miles per hour. It curved onto the other side of the planet. It did not disappear. It got smaller and smaller as it curved to the other side of the planet. I know for a fact that was extraterrestrial. The light never flickered and there was no sound. Bright as a star. It seemed to be high in our atmosphere when it did its stunts.;35.2845;-81.2864
