Daytime sighting of round rotating low altitude UFO.;2011-02-25 15:57:00;25-30 seconds;Daytime sighting of round rotating low altitude UFO. I was in my backyard when a flash above my head caught my eye. I looked up and saw a ball shaped (round) rotating wingless craft traveling eastward around 60-70 mph at around 1000-1500 ft altitude in a direct line towards Charlotte NC. The ball was rapidly rotating..it was red then black...then it would flash.The flash was really bright..like a camera flash.Then it would repeat over and over. The craft was nearly vertical over my position and it was absolutely silent.There was a strong 25 to 35 mph wind blowing crossways to the travel of the craft. And it had no effect on its line of travel. It was slightly larger than a Cessna type plane..and traveling far lower than they usually do. I watch the skies regularly. And can easily identify helos both military and civilian/Cessnas/Jets both small and large. I have seen blimps and balloons. Even saw a biplane once. But this wasn't even close to any of these.  And again...it was totally silent. Had the flash not caught my eye.  I would have missed it. This was a cloudless bright sunny day...at 3:57 in the afternoon. I do not use drugs.  And I don't drink. I am as sober a person as they come.;35.2845;-81.2864
