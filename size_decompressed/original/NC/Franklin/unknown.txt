On November 7,2009 I was out on my patio having a smoke and I looked up at the sky and noticed a group of lights that were turning different colors. As I watched  these lights they started moving, they would move side to side and up and down. They appeared in the eastern sky about 135 degrees off the ground. They looked like they were about 50 miles from my house, and about 35 miles apart. I couldn't make out the shape of them, but the lights I saw looked like they took up the whole front on the object. This wasn't the first time I saw them, but when I did see them before  I thought my  eyes were playing tricks on me, but after seeing two of them together tonight I knew  they were real I'm a 70 year old male who is retired and living here in North Carolina.;35.1829581395348;-83.3863837209301

While it was at that distance away it looked as if there was a jet flying below it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
