It was just sitting there over top the ridge of the mountain, then it just totally disappeared.  This was my very first sighting...skeptical at first at what my eyes were seeing, but now other explanation.  We live in a very rural area in the mountains, now houses up on that knob, and very little airplane traffic, and a plane doesn't just sit there anyway!  I'm kinda excited!;35.1829581395348;-83.3863837209301
