It stared when my mother say alight in the eastern part of the horizon at12:30am. she told me about it and I told her to tell me if she say it again know matter what time.A few nights later she called me at 12:00am to let me know it was back.I drove to her house and we watched what appeared to be a bright wight light with red and blue lights strobeing around the center,it moved very slowly from left too right then it slowly vanished.I believe the date was 09/22/99.We have also seen it on separate occasoins in much the same way.Also looking at it through a telascope was like looking at a prisem it's indiscirbable.WE would realy like to know if any one else has seen something similar in this area.Thank you.;35.1829581395348;-83.3863837209301
Multi-colored lights red, orange and white lights hovering in wester night sky intensely bright , no sound;2016-09-07 22:41:00;5 minutes;Multi colored lights red , Orange and white lights hovering in wester night sky intensely bright , no sound this object was to the west north west of home at altitude (guessing )1500' to 2500' . was circle , with alternating lights mostly red , orange ...like a fire ,and smaller white lights . all lights were intensely bright , brighter than any star in sky . it was almost motionless but was slowly moving up 2 degrees and same downward . then it would move slowly 3 degrees to west . A aircraft to the west 7 to 10 degrees and minimum 2000' above object flew above and to left of object and no response from object . distance from me i cannot really judge but index finger would not cover object but my thumb would , hope that helps . I watched it for about a minute and then called my 28 yr old son to look at object an tell me what he saw ....he was flabbergasted because he said ..daddy , that's no star or plane and we watched it for about 5 minutes more . i turned to him and asked ..where did it go ? do you still see it ? he said no and we both concurred that either th! e object just cut all lights off or it took off too fast for our eyes . this is as detailed as i can get . thank you;35.1829581395348;-83.3863837209301
