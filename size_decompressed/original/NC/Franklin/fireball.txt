Green ball of light over Western NC;2007-01-24 20:00:00;3 secs;Green ball of light over Western NC I was outside having a cigarette when something caught my attention over my left shoulder (North of town).  I turned my head and saw a green ball of light for a split second, then it moved away rapidly.  It proceeded to move NE out of view.  The whole event was no more than 3 seconds. There were reports of this sighting on an Asheville, NC, newschannel (ABC 13) this morning (1/26/07) - Asheville is an hour away, (ENE) so there are others who may have viewed the object along this direction. My sightline of this object was between a two trees.  It was not close as there was no glow on local vegetation.  I would guess the object's size to be that of a tennis ball, based loosely in comparison to the trees.  I do not know how close or how far away the object was from me, so my size estimate is only in reference to the trees and therefore not absolute!   The object HAD to be in a state of no motion when I first viewed it, for as it moved away (rapidly), the shape was indiscernable.   As the object moved away, it had properties of a comet - longer with a green tail. It was an incredible experience and I'd like others to share their story as well.

Slow moving fireball, with no sound, in North Carolina.;2015-08-01 22:30:00;~30 seconds;Slow moving fireball, with no sound, in North Carolina. Three of us were sitting on my porch in Franklin, NC, when one of us saw the fireball come over the mountains from the west.  We all looked at it and I thought it was a comet of some sort, but it didn’t make any sounds, didn’t leave any kind of trail and it was moving much more slowly than it should have been I thought.   It moved from West to East just south of us and it took quite a long time to do so.  It was glowing like it was on fire but again, no tail.  It seemed like a giant hot ball of iron glowing after being pulled out of the fire.  Compared to the size of the planes in the sky it was either quite close or very large.   After seeing it move through the sky and behind the mountains on the east, it felt more like it was something that was made to look like a comet or meteor.   After we couldn’t see it anymore we all waited outside for any kind of sound.  Thinking if it hit somewhere we would hear or feel something you know.  There was no sound though, even when a jet passes at 30,000 feet overhead you can hear the roar of the engines after it has passed, so it was quite strange that there was absolutely no sound at all.   Not sure what it was, but I thought it was worth reporting.  Thanks! ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) My fault, it was 10:30 pm. Sorry about that, Thanks!
