I did not see a ship and have never seen anything like this before and cannot imagine anything moving so fast.  If anyone else saw this, please report it so I don't think I'm goin crazy.

Erratically moving object in night sky.;2018-11-17 21:30:00;1.5 hours;Erratically moving object in night sky. While looking to the northeast on a clear night we saw a small, white light which we at first thought was a stair.  We then observed that it was moving in circles and erratically while staying in basically the  same location.  There was no wind and nothing, i.e. trees, between us and the object.  We took several videos on our phones.;35.1829581395348;-83.3863837209301
