A hazy,thin line grew in brightness and then seemed to split open with light!  A friend and I just got out of the car and we noticed a thin lighting shaped line at a very high altitude and was stationary. We went in to get my friends mom and when we went back out it was gone. We stood there lookin for it, when we noticed something simular reappearing. This time it was veritcal and straight. It grew brighter and more distinct and then seemed to burst with a bright light. After this, it went back to a hazy dim line and shifted around to be horizontal. It stayed like this a few more minutes and then slowy faded away. We could see stars behind it so we don't think it could have been clouds ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness observed the launch of several missiles out of Wallops Island, VA, to test the upper atmosphere.  We will attempt to confirm the time and the date.  PD));35.6095;-78.138
