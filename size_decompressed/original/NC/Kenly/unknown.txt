The event date is not known for sure, but around 06/08/06, I stepped out the storm door and gazed at the stars on a clear nite, facing east.  Within a minute, a craft came into view, gliding smoothly, horizontally, with a light about as bright as a spot light or a bright white light, which seemed to be a usual craft I had seen before. The first craft went beyond the roof of the house and I paid it no mind.  Well, then here comes another craft in the same travel space a few seconds later, of the same charicteristics!  Well, this time, it came to a stop and hovered about 10 to 15 seconds. The craft was about 130 degrees from the ground, in the air, which I assume that would put it somewhere close to the airforce base in Goldsboro N.C.  The craft then shot vertically so fast, it dissapered, and I had to catch the light with my eyes!   I then watched this light or craft, dissipate in the stars, and that took about 20 sec, and I lost visual contact with it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally detailed in his description of his sighting.  We suspect that he is an exceptionally good observer, and a quite credible witness.  Date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.6095;-78.138
