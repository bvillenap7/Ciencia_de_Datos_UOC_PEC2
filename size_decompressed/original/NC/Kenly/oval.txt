extremely fast moving light with no sound;2003-06-22 21:30:00;5 -6 seconds;extremely fast moving light with no sound the sky was clear with no clouds and bright stars. no city lights beacause i live in the country. my wife and i were talking about shooting stars when i noticed what follows. there was a dim flat white light with a brighter blinking light on the center. it was blinking rapidly. it was not very high in the sky and was moving from left to right at an extremely fast pace. it went from straight in front of me (12oclock) towards my right till about 5 oclock all in about 5 seconds. my wife asked what it was and i told her i had no idea. ive never seen anything move that fast in the sky. it was dead quiet outside and we never heard any noise. we were on the deck and once it got past the house we lost sight of it because the house blocked our view.;35.6095;-78.138
