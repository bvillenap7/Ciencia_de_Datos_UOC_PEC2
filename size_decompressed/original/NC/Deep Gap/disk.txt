Five lighted craft dance about Orion during a meteor shower, spotted from the Appalachian Mountains.;2009-10-22 00:00:00;3 1/2 hrs;Five lighted craft dance about Orion during a meteor shower, spotted from the Appalachian Mountains. My friends and I were out for the meteor shower, we waited till midnight, then looked up toward Orion as we were told to.  We saw a few nice meteors, then my friend points out a satellite.  As soon as I see it drifting across Orion, it stops at the feet of the constellation.   I immediately tell my friend, this is no satellite.  We discuss what it could be for about three minutes, till it began to move again.  It drifted, dropped, darted to the lift and the right, came back to stationary, and generally danced around like a bumble bee.  Once I was sure of what we were seeing, we grabbed a few more witnesses.  At one point, the craft moved up to Orion's right shoulder and sat there.  My friend and I were afraid we had lost it, until it started to move up and down, over and over again: waving Orion's arm at us.  It had to be within 15,000 feet, because I could make out a shape, and distinguish colors of light that it flashed: red, blue, green, yellow, and white.  They wer! e brighter than Orion's belt, twinkled, and were distinguishable by a haze or glow it emitted. Several planes entered the area but stayed far away from the lights.  The night was super clear, just a sliver of a crescent moon, and not a cloud in the sky. By the end of the night, I had spotted three more disk shaped objects, two were moving in unison. Then there was one large rectangular thing with a round front end with a strange pattern of lights on it, it was much larger than the saucers as well.  I went to bed at 3:30, and they were still there, the one I saw originally at the feet of Orion was no longer distinguishable, but was a tiny bright white dot in the atmosphere. I will never forget that night, and will never deny what it was that I saw.;36.2125;-81.5211
