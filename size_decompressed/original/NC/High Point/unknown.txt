Very fast and turned. Not a meteor.;2004-10-22 08:00:00;45 seconds?;Very fast and turned. Not a meteor. Sitting at a stop sign on country road and facing south we both saw object moving very fast at about 45 degree angle from horizon. Object had bright light on front with lesser light behind it. First thought was meteor due to incredible speed, but soon realized it was not falling, but heading west on horizonal path. My friend jumped out of car to observe better and object curved into a northly direction. We tried to pursue a better view, but it was soon out of sight over northern horizon. There was no sound at all. Too fast for airplane & we don't think missles have lights on them(?).;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
Red and white lights saw in the sky and attempted communication.;2015-05-24 00:00:00;15 minutes;Red and white lights saw in the sky and attempted communication. I was out tonight looking for Saturn's because it was still at opposition.  I had my telescope out looking for Saturn.  I had my dog out and my mother came out to help me look, as I did not know where to look (and still don't) for saturn.  I was casually looking to the Southeast from my houses perspective and mine.  I had noticed a fast, bright red light flying across the sky going at a incredibly fast speed.  It then disappeared from my view. I then observed a 2nd ship (or possibly the same one, I'm not entirely sure.) with white lights flying the same speed as the first one.  However, this one had a white light instead of a red one and it flew in a  different direction.  This one flew in the flight path of the Red one, going through the flight path at the side, instead of straight like the Red one or when it had it's red light on.  The white one or different crafts (since I'm not entirely sure, I cannot rule out the possibility of there being more then one.) danced around in the sky, seeming to do impossible movements that any known aircraft to my knowledge could do.  My mother tried to signal it with a Android Smartphone light.  The craft responded by blinking its light once again.;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
