3 cone shaped objects in backyard.;2016-10-17 15:00:00;20 minutes;3 cone shaped objects in backyard Whilst outside painting the house with my granddaughter, my granddaughter alerted me to some strange objects floating in the sky.  I proceeded to look in the direction she was pointing and noticed 3 shuttlecock-shaped objects floating slowly through the air above tall bushes in our yard.  They were gold in color with no sound coming from them.  We immediately contacted other family members to describe what we saw. Before any other family members were able to come home, the objects disappeared into thin air. We have not seen those particular objects since but, have seen much more mysterious activity in the following days.;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
