Bright green streak falling towards earth;2006-01-07 02:40:00;2-3 seconds;Bright green streak falling towards earth This morning on the way home, my girlfriend and I saw a beautiful meteor fall.  It was bright green and streaked across the sky so fast that had it not been directly ahead of us we would have missed it completely.  The sky was so clear and the stars were very visible.;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
Multiple round, bright orange objects flew above High Point, NC;2009-04-27 20:18:00;3hrs;Multiple round, bright orange objects flew above High Point, NC Objects seen were round and were bright orange. They did not leave any afterglo as they silently slid across the sky. All of the objects seen traveled in the same direction heading north.  They traveled in the same straight path and elevation.  During the time we observed them, the sky was clear of cloud cover and we did see other planes flying at higher elevations in relation to the objects. Initially, we saw two such objects.  Within minutes after them, we observed a formation of seven.  During the time when we saw the larger formation, we tried to place calls using our cell phones, but our phones seem to be temporarily dead.  We do not know if this is a coincidence or connection to the events. After the initial large group flew by, we watched as they traveled mostly in pairs. Several of the objects looked like they were trying to catch up with the preceeding group, as they were flying at a higher speed. We have multiple videos taken with digital cameras.;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
7 bright orange glowing lights in a steady formation going NW.;2009-04-27 23:00:00;1 minute;7 bright orange glowing lights in a steady formation going NW. My husband and I came home after picking up groceries late that night. As we were getting everything out of the car I noticed seven large low bright orange glowing balls flying in a uniform formation. There were three in a line, side by side with three in a line with one light below them in a triangle shape. It may have been separate objects or lights on one very large circular or oval shaped object--- it reminded us a lot of the phoenix lights- just glowing orange. There was no sound or jet trails.  They looked similar to paper glowing air lanterns-- but I do not believe they were because the wind was blowing in the opposite direction, and the objects kept their shape and stayed true. They were moving in a northwestern direction, traveling at a speed similar to geese flying. I can't believe someone else saw this too I blogged about it and received no response.   I saw something similar on another post on this reporting sight for the same day, and now I know that others saw, and I want to confirm what we saw was very similar. This is our first unidentified object that I have absolutely no explanation for. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the time of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
Bright light spotted in High Point NC over lake.;2020-02-17 20:14:00;3 seconds;Bright light spotted in High Point NC over lake. (Sorry for submitting this twice, I realized I set the date to today, and not Monday, on accident.)  I was arriving to my step fathers house at around 9 PM EST, and I looked up to the sky above his house, which overlooks some semi-tall trees and leades into a lake.  When I looked above, I saw a flash of light that stayed in the air for a good few seconds. The light descended slowly, much larger than a plane and more slowly than that, until it disappeared behind the house.  My mother was with me, but she didn't see it, as she was taking bags out of the car.  It was large, about the size of the moon, but much brighter.  As it descended behind the trees I tried to run around to the back, but it was already gone.  The shape was nearly perfectly circular, but I describe it as a fireball because of the hazy outside of bright blue along with the white center.;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
