One night me and my wife, back in roughly 2003, was living with my grandmother and knowing we could not smoke in the house decided to go out about 1:30am and have a cigarette.  We are always looking up in the sky but tonight was special.  Had we not looked up we would have never seen what I'm about to describe it was that quiet. We seen what I call the star trek enterprise.  The size of the spacecraft was so big, I'm talking at least 75 to 100 yards in length.  Slightly triangular but no real light effects none other than 2 red lights that was lite but not blinking on each side of the wings.  This spacecraft was least than 100 yards in the sky and had a speed of least than 100 mph.  The level of detail outside the ship was brownish/Gray colored with different levels to the ship.  We could not see any windows but you could tell it was able to house at 1000 UFO's or more.  What was so amazing about the siti! ng is that it was so quiet you could not hear a sound.  I wish we could of at least took a picture but back then cell phone barely had enough numbers to dial!;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523

We were driving home and the craft just hovered over the highway for at leats 5 minutes. i noticed it then my wife finally said something about it not moving just hovering. we both thought maybe it was a plane heading towords us. then we finally drove under it and past it and it nevere moved we got some pictures of it but they never showed up on camera. then we finally could pull off the highway and we turned to seeit and we couldnt find it naymore. we noticed other car looking at it too because they slowed down and sworved just like we were doing. From a distance it loked like an airplane it had a triangle look form a distance and once upon it it looked like a flying triangle hovering. Teh lights were redish and white lights. just like a plane but none were flashing or like landing lights. me and my wife are not really believers in UFO but this was somehting very strange.;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523

Huge Hoovering Triangle of Lights in High Point, NC!!!;2010-09-10 21:30:00;20;Huge Hoovering Triangle of Lights in High Point, NC!!! Me and my fiance were driving along Eastchester Blvd. in High Point, NC when saw a huge horizontal line of white lights approx. 1/2 mile wide hoovering in mid-air.  It hid and revealed itself in the distance while somehow flipping flatly into a triangular shape and it had white round lights all over!  It seemed to just float/glide, and would move very quick across the sky.  We followed it for about 3 miles, and when we stopped in some undeveloped housing area, we caught a very clear view of it hoovering over an empty field.  There was also a plane that was moving at a very fast speed chasing the object.  But as it got closer to it, the triangle would move out of the way very quickly.  We then heard a very strange noise and as we turned our radio down, it sounded like a high-pitched hum.  That's when we said OH S*** and almost wrecked our car turning around and getting the heck outta there.  We didn't have a decent camera with us to get any evidence as we wer! e just leaving a nearby restaurant.  We tried taking pictures with our camera phones, but because of the darkness and cheap 2 megapixel camera, we couldn't see the thing clearly.

Huge, gun metal black triangular with 3 white lights and blinking colored lights hovering, no sound.;2011-08-15 19:00:00;5 minutes;Huge, gun metal black triangular with 3 white lights and blinking colored lights hovering, no sound. I was coming home from the store and had reached a red light at the intersection for the mall entrance. There were no other cars around which was strange in itself. I glanced to the right and did a double take because what I saw was unbelievable and it shook me up so much that I forgot I had my cell phone with me. The craft, that's all I know to call it, was huge!  Black and triangular in shape, 3 large white lights and smaller blinking lights connecting them.  It was hovering about 100 or so feet above the tree line. Just sitting there, no sound at all. It was more dull kind of like a gun metal black color and believe meâ€¦ HUGE! I watched it until the light changed and tried to keep it in sight until I could get home to get my camera. I could see it well until I turned into my drive when the tree line covered it I thought.  I caught one last glimpse of it as I approached my house. I got out of my car and ran in the house thinking I may be able to see it from t! he 2nd story window but when I looked out the window it was no where to be seen.  I got back into my car with my camera and headed back to the site but it was no longer there.  I will never forget this because even though I've sited ufos before, I've never seen on of this size nor up that close and personal!  Amazing!  I checked several sites on the web, the newspaper, the radio but so far nobody else has reported seeing it except that apparently, there were other siting all around other towns in NC.;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
Slow moving Triangle made no noise;2012-11-08 21:00:00;1 minute;slow moving Triangle made no noise Had gone out to check the mail and while at the mail box noticed lights above.  Six white lights on the bottom of triangular shaped craft.  The lights formed a triangle inside a triangle.  It was extremely low and moved very slow.  It made no noise at all and just floated beyond the tree line.;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
