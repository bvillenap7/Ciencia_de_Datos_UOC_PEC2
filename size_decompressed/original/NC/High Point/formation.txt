Balls of light appearing in sky, seemingly interacting with larger light.;2016-10-22 18:00:00;1 hour;Balls of light appearing in sky, seemingly interacting with larger light. While looking at a very large and bright object toward the West of town, we noticed that the object would frequently change shape, move, and occasionally dim/disappear.  Around this same object, were a approximately 4 small balls of light that seemed to communicate with each other, along with being in a zig-zag formation.  Over our home during this same period of time, we witnessed 2 similar balls of light travelling horizontally in sequence seemingly connected by a dark beam when pointed out by an individual, the beam disappeared causing the balls of light to disconnect but were still travelling in the same path. Each night afterwards, similar occurrences and activities have appeared near or around our home, day or night----as if they are watching us.  Taunting us with what we know and cannot prove to others.  Whether or not we can see the smaller balls of light, the larger object appears nightly at approx. the same time (7pm) and leaves approx. the same time (8:15-8:30pm).;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
