V-shaped craft hovering near High Point;2007-01-16 21:00:00;5 min;V-shaped craft hovering near High Point On Jan 16 I was driving north on US 311 between High Point and Winston-Salem NC. Around 9 pm I looked to the left (south) and saw a V-shaped craft hovering about 1000 feet in the air. It was quite close to the highway, close enough to see a series of red and white light along the wings. It looked like an airplane without the body. It did not move or emit any sound. It appeared to be shiny metal with some reflected light off the surface. I did not stop as I was on my way home from a local hospital where I work as a physician.  I have never seen a UFO and have always been skeptical that any aliens have visited earth as we have no physical proof. This did not strike me as an alien or extraterrestrial craft, it just looked like a man-made craft that somehow was able to hover silently. However, I have no explanation for what kind of craft could have appeared as it did.;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
