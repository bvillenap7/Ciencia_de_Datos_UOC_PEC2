It had a wide, bright white tail fanning out from from a point at the front of the fan. I looked at it through 2 sets of binoculars and a 90mm Retractor. Through all of these instruments it looked just like a comet in the sky with the exception of a random flashing blue light either at the forefront of the tail or somewhere inside of it. It moved though the sky very slowly but in only one direction. It dissipated after about 25-30 minutes. I thought perhaps it was the remnants of a trail from a rocket. I checked for a shuttle launch but one did not take place this evening. I believe it was some kind of smoke remnant but I simply cannot explain the intermittent blue light. I will continue to sour the internet for an answer to this phenonmenon. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
Odd flying thing showed up in photo.;2010-07-14 18:00:00;unknown;Odd flying thing showed up in photo. At about 1800 hours on 7/14 i was making a photo checking the camera for a photo shoot when i got home and down loaded the photos i saw some thing in the photo.  As i made it bigger i saw a odd shaped thing in the air near a powder pole.  It has the shape kind of a disk or some thing like that, not really sure.  The photo was 12mp but can not be made big enough to tell much other, than that some thing odd is in the photo.;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
