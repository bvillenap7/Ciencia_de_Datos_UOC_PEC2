It made no sound and had no lights I saw a round Black object move across the moon from west to east. It moved like a ballon floating but it was traveling horizontal to the ground at a pretty good speed. I noticed there wasn't any wind at all so I didn't think it was a ballon. There were no lights and there was no sound. It was pretty quiet around our neigborhood. I watched it for about 1 minute, it flew over the lake and I lost sight of it in the night sky;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
Metallic sphere pauses and becomes transparent after being spotted.;2013-11-19 14:00:00;1 minute;Metallic sphere pauses and becomes transparent after being spotted At about 2:00pm on November 19th, I was walking up my driveway to the mailbox when something caught my eye.  Above the tree line to the south, a metallic silver sphere was moving at a constant speed eastward. I continued watching the object, walking backwards, as I ascended uphill to gain a better view.  When I got to the top of the driveway, it continued as it had for a moment... then, paused for a view seconds in one place.  When it started back up, the speed was the same as it had been, but it became more and more transparent!  It wasn't moving further way, it was still appearing to be the same size. It eventually disappeared. The whole sighting lasted about 50-60 seconds.  I cannot figure out what it was- it was perfectly round and very fast so it couldn't be a plane.  No audible noise or vibrations accompanied it- everything was quiet and calm during this time.;35.971082846252;-79.9963463786523
