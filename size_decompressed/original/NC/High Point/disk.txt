Disk oval shaped with light coming down fast and disappearing in mid air!!;2016-03-30 00:00:00;10 seconds;Disk oval shaped with light coming down fast and disappearing in mid air!! So I am sitting out on my balcony smoking.  I see something coming down out my the corner of my eye.  First thought that it was a place but it was coming down to fast and I looked up and saw this light with a disk oval shape and I concentrated so hard to notice the shape looked like something in back was black with light in the front.  It came down with a slant and then out of no where it disappeared in mid air!!!  Something scary as hell.   My brother saw the same thing the night before...this has changed my whole view on life!!
