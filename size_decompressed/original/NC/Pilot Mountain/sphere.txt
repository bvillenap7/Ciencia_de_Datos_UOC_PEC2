A lit pulsating,moving spiroghraph design.;2001-10-18 22:00:00;3 min.;A lit pulsating,moving spiroghraph design. I was filming deer in the field behind my home, when i noticed a bright light above the treeline. It appeared to be approx. a quarter mile away. It appeared to be approx. the size of a distant full moon. As i videoed the light I zoomed in several times with my Sony 450 x digital zoom. The light appeared to be translucent {like a jellyfish would be under light.} The object pulsates and looks like a moving spirograph design. I have approx. 2 min of detailed video on digital high eight film. There is also footage of some jumpy wildlife aprox. 1min just befor and after the sighting. At no time was any sound heard from the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and his wife, and they both seemed quite sincere.  The digital still image forwarded looks like a very small point of light.  We will request to look at the video.  PD));36.4096;-80.4899
