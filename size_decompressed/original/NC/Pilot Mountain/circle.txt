There was a blue light that appeared behind some trees right at the top;2019-06-03 23:49:00;A few seconds;illuminating blue light in the sky moving really fast and then disapeared I was sitting outside on my porch with a few friends talking like we always do and i have a tendency to look up and look at the stars at night when we are talking.  They didn't notice it but they all believed me because of my reaction its hard to fake, anyways there was a blue light that appeared behind some trees right at the top i could see the top of the circle but not the bottom.  The best way i can describe it would be that it looked like a spotlight from a helicopter only it wasn't shining in a particular direction just illuminating.   The light stayed at the top of the trees never leaving my sight and moved at what looked like normal aircraft speed across the top of the treeline until it just vanished.  No one believes me but i know what i saw so i called a friend the morning after and said something about it and they said they had seen a blue light too.  His description was the exact same as mine just in a different area.  I know for sure we both seen it because he is just as confused as me.   I know the description is very vague but that is the best i can do i hope other who see this also report it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness confirmed that correct date is June 03rd, 2019.
