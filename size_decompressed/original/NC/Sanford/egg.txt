On 02/14/03 my cousin  and I was  coming from  a  dance when I  looked  up  in the  sky and  seen  a  big  bright  light  in  the  sky. It  looked  like  a white  car  light as I got close to it I  ask my  cousin did  she see it  too,  and she said  yes what  is that. so I  begain to slow  down  to a stop  and  rolled  down  my  window  of the car. It was  shaped  like an egg or oval shape the  light was on  the top  shining upward then  when  I stop  the  light  went  out and a whole lot of little  lights came  on  in red, blue, green yellow, and  white they started to blink then  fad in and out even with them out I could still see the big shape in the sky and it was raining  just a little  bit.  This is my second time seeing an ufo;35.4612131386861;-79.1627927007305
