Circular  UFO with multi colored lights hovering with no sound.;2003-08-20 20:00:00;10 minutes;Circular  UFO with multi colored lights hovering with no sound. This event occurred in August 2003  at a house my wife at the time and two of my kids were renting.   My wife and youngest daughter were at work and my youngest son  and I were at the house.  He was in his room playing video games.  It was dusk and I happened to look out the kitchen window which was at the rear of two story house on first floor when I see multi-colored lights in a field about 350 feet away.  I went out to overgrown field through a wooden gate and  walked to within maybe 100 feet of craft.  It was hovering at about 150 feet AGL and made no noise.  The lights were multi colored and flashing.  The craft seemed to me to be about 25 feet in diameter, circular and it being dusk was a dark color.  I just stood there in amazement and felt like I was in a trance, definitely mesmerized by it.   I served 20 plus years in the Army and even time in Air cavalry unit so know what aircraft look like and this was no military or civilian craft I ever seen especially  emitting no noise or sound.  I was transfixed by this object and  it seemed  like I was out there in field for only 10 minutes but when I finally went into the house at least 45-60 minutes had elapsed.  When I went back out awhile later craft was gone.;35.4612131386861;-79.1627927007305
