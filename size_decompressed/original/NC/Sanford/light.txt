Huge Whitish light;2011-08-19 23:00:00;8-10 minutes;Huge Whitish light I was outside with my dog and noticed a very big whitish color light to the West go across the sky from North to South.  I called my husband to come have a look and see if he could see anything.  No sooner had he got outside, when it happened again, in the exact same direction.  We stayed outside with the outside lights off and saw it happen again 6 more times over an 8-10 minute time frame.  Then it appeared from the South, went in a direction to the North, stopped stationary for a couple of minutes, then seemed to turn and shoot off back to the South.  It was approximately the size of the moon, quite close and at first we thought it may be some type of spotlight until we saw there was no beam emitting from it, it was just a hugh solid light, whitish in color and moving at a medium fast speed.;35.4612131386861;-79.1627927007305

((anonymous report));2016-11-06 02:15:00;10;I had went to my back porch to make sure the door was locked when I saw a huge bright light in the sky.  I thought at first it was a star, but I kept staring for some reason and I realized it was brighter than any star out there.  I kept watching and I saw that it was moving in upward and downard motions but side to side.  Then little lights shot out from it going straight down at an angle.
