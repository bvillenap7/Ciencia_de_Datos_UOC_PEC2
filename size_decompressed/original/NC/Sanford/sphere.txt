It was a overcast sat. morning. My cousin and I left my gand parents house in the country.they live 5 miles down dirt rd in a heavly wooded area. we had taken the dirt rd. that when out by the pond. we stop the car on the dam of the pond. we were talking about my grand father that just had pass away few days before. I noticed a bright white light perfecty round bright in center with halow or almost like bubble apearance on outside of the bright light. it was the size of a basketball. it was flying below tree top level between the pond and trees.the speed was 10 to 15 miles per hour. it crossed in front of our path on the dam going back into the woods. I started to ask my cousin what is that? before i could get it out the light stopped backed out of the woods. it was like it had the same thought about us.then zoomed up to the front or the car.it made no sound in its movements, it was about 6 foot in front of us and 5 foot off the ground. I was so scared could! not move it set there for about 5 seconds then it when away at a high rate of speed up flash or blur almost. it seemed to change directions like a humming bird.My cousin started the car and we got the heck out of there. never said much more about it in that no one would believe us anyway.;35.4612131386861;-79.1627927007305
