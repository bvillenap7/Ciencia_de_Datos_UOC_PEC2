Saw what I thought to be a star off over treeline, then didn't remember it being there a few minutes ago.   Okay I live in heavy air traffic area as well from CLT.  For a few seconds appeared to be coming slightly closer then stopped and begin darting from right to left up and down and changing in brightness, this was no airplane any plane would have broken apart moving like this.   Only traveled what looked like small increments and stayed around one area for about ten to fifteen minutes. slowly drifted out of sight and then I couldn't see at all.;35.2415000000001;-81.0447999999997
