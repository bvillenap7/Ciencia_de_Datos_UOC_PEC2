A circular object just appeared in the night sky.  My husband and I were outside, he was having a smoke break and the object was there right above us in the sky, he said what is that, and I looked up, in the direction over our house, and the object was moving very fast through the trees behind our house.  It sort of reminded me of a comet with a very short tail.  We kept looking but did not see anything else.  It just seemed to disappear.

Black mass floating and traveling SouthEast in Belmont NC;2016-09-16 04:30:00;2 minutes;Black mass floating and traveling SouthEast in Belmont NC As my wife and I were walking our dog a black mass (thought it was a bird at first) caught my attention south west of downtown Belmont.  The mass seemed to appear out of nowhere and hovered for a moment but then proceeded to travel in a southeast direction making no noise. At first, I thought this may have been a bird but there was no flapping of wings as it progressed further in its travel.  Unsure of what this thing was other than unidentified.;35.2415000000001;-81.0447999999997
