On july 4th, me and three friends were on the end of a dock on the lake watching fireworks and swimming. one of my friends said something about how clear the sky was and that you could see a lot of stars. as we all agreed i kinda took a gaze into the sky admiring the clear night. i noticed a bright orange object just kinda moving along the tree line from maybee 2000 ft away.  i quickly realize that its not a firework or a plane or even a satalight. i tell my 3 friends to look and we all watched as it slowly moved through the sky. we were all kinda like wtf is that?!?  it started to go over the tree line to where we could barely see it but it stoped right there and just dissapeard. it looked like a flame or a bright campfire, but with no defining shape.  i call it an orb. there was also a plane going right over while we were watching this orb, kinda weird to see a plane then that thing cruisen near it. well its cool theres this website to report this, and i see where someone else saw the same thing the same night in skys not far away.   Deffinatly freaked me out a little but i am very interested in more information about this. ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot certify that this is a serious report.
