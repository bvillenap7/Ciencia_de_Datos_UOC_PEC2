static white opaque object with dark black center;2020-11-17 18:00:00;5-7 minutes;static white opaque object with dark black center Yesterday on November 17, 2020, around 6 PM I was traveling from Charlotte, North Carolina to Belmont, North Carolina when I observed a strange object in the sky.  I observed it for 5-7 minutes.  After I arrived to my home, I parked and began walking towards an area where I hoped to continue observing it but I could not see it.  The object appeared large and was positioned vertically and shaped like a stretched out oval with the bottom of the oval being denser in mass the top.  The top of the oval almost appeared to trail the object, which first led me to believe it may be a comet.  When the object did not move it was apparent it was not a comet.  It was white with a light orange hue and was opaque with the outer rim having a cloudlike quality that was less opaque.  The center of the object was black and had no opaque quality.  The center did not appear to be reflecting light. The black center contrasted starkly with the outer rim. I could not see anything solid in the center â€“ only blackness, almost like a dark hole.;35.2415000000001;-81.0447999999997
