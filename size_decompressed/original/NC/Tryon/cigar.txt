a gigantic aircraft that had no sound at all.;2004-09-20 00:00:00;4 minutes;a gigantic aircraft that had no sound at all. i was sitting on my couch in my upstairs apartment and i seen a bright light out side as i was trying to use my cell phone. so i went outside to see what it was and almost as soon as i opend my door the light went out. but thier were three remaining lights. their were two blinking red lights at each end of a monsterous air craft. their was also a light that looked like it could have been a cockpit of some sort because it gave off a light such as one that you would see inside a house if you were driving down the road. but this object was so close to the ground and so huge that if it were an airplane it would have made a very noticable sound. so i watched in amezement as the object slowly moved across the sky. i live in the mountains so it was way to low for a blimp or anything like that to be flying here. i would say it was only about 150 yards in the air above me.;35.2188;-82.2395999999999
