Strange lights in NC sky.;2007-10-01 20:00:00;10 seconds;Strange lights in NC sky. While talking to my neighbor, we observed a bright white light, just above us at approximately 60 degree angle to the north.  It appeared to be landing lights on a small plane and it also appeared that the pilot turned them off as he was flying towards us.   My neighbor asked why would a pilot have on his landing lights, so we watched and listened.  NO plane was heard or seen in the area.  He stated that later that same night, while walking his dog, he observed the same thing, but it came from the west the second time. The next night, my neighbor, his wife and I were talking, when we observed a solid white light crossing the sky from north to south, no blinking or noise. I am a local deputy sheriff and also retired from law enforcement in another state. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));35.2188;-82.2395999999999
