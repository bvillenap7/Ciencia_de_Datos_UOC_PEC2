3 sets of red lights seem near Princeton NC;2016-03-01 20:30:00;5 minutes;3 sets of red lights seem near Princeton NC My Husband and I were going to get some dinner about 8:30 pm on March 1st, it had just gotten dark, as we went down the road we stay on we saw a very bright light with a small red light on the side of it down toward the river, we could not tell if the small light was attached to the large light or not . We thought it was a helicopter cause we live near an air force base, as we continued to town we watched the bright light and the little red light moving toward us,it seem to be moving just not very fast, as we traveled closer to town we came to a business site that has a large drive way just off the road and we stopped to see if we could tell just what it was.   By this time the large bright light and little red light had gotten closer to us . It was not very high in the air that's why we thought it was a helicopter.   We stopped and rolled down our windows to hear if there was any  helicopter sounds because we still thought it was a helicopter, but we could not hear any noise of a helicopter at all so I turn the truck off and listen again no noise, by this time the craft was even closer , but when the truck head lights went out, the large bright light on the craft went out too, and then we saw 3 sets of small red lights off set from each other.  We then got out of the truck and stood in front of the truck, watching and listen to see if we could tell what it was, just then it started to turn away from us still moving very slow and with out any noise at all. One set of red lights was in front, one set in the middle just a little lower than the others  and the other set was up toward what look like the back of the craft but we could not make out the body of the craft, the red lights moved together and appeared to be together.  We watched it as it went out of our sight, we just looked at each other and got back in the truck and were talking about what we thought it could have been since it we knew it was not a helicopter ,we went and got our food. As we were heading home , we had to stop at the stop light on 70 hwy and a police car pulled up behind us when the stop light changed we went across 70 hwy the police car turned on its lights and flew around us really fast and went in the same directions as the craft did.  Not sure if someone had reported it to the police or not .;35.4484;-78.1709
