7 Red lights in a straight line they were there no noise no movement and were gone;2008-03-15 21:30:00;2 MINUTES;7 Red lights in a straight line they were there no noise no movement and were gone A friend and I were outside talking when she said to look over there at those lights.  I looked and saw 7 lights all red with the exact same distance between them in a straight line.  They didn't move we heard no noise and they disappeared the same as they had appeared. A couple of weeks later, I was at the same location and in the distance I saw those 7 red lights in a straight line and as I watched they seemed to slowly come together as if to make one and before or just as they completely came together I blinked and they were gone.  No noise this time either. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));34.9814;-80.0742
