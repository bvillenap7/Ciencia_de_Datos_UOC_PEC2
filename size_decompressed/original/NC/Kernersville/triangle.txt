Three points of light in triangle alignment.;1997-07-15 21:30:00;5 seconds;Three points of light in triangle alignment. Saw three points of light come from the West, all fixed as if they were each a point of one triangle - they stayed in this alignment the entire time.  The lights were bright and stood out against the night sky.   I was never able to make out an object, only lights.  Traveling at an unbelievable speed, the object(s) came to a complete stop without even slowing down.  It hovered for less than a second, then continued East at the same speed before coming to a second complete stop.  The object never took time to speed up or slow down.  It hovered for less than a second again before traveling at the same speed but in the reverse direction - towards the West.   The object stopped a third time, again without taking time to slow down.   The object then continued in the original direction until it was out of sight.   The entire episode lasted less than five seconds.   The lights were amber colored.;36.1167928792568;-80.0836603715177
