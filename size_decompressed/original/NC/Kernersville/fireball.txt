Two flickering fireballs moved across unobstructed view, 8 acre, field.  There was no noise at all. They were moving pretty fast when they came across the tree line, heading east from Winston-Salem, right towards us.  They slowed down as the came across the field.  Then they changed direction completely, sped up, and headed north until we couldnâ€™t see them anymore.  Then another, third one, came in almost the same pattern, finally heading off to the north.  It looked like it was 1500 ft off the ground and moved parallel to the ground until it headed off to the north which it started gaining elevation and speed.  The light from it looked kind of like an orange flare.  There was no smoke or trail though. I would estimate that it travelled several miles before we lost sight of it.  We have never seen anything like it.;36.1167928792568;-80.0836603715177
Orangish Red glowing lights.;2016-03-16 21:15:00;5 minutes;Coming home from dinner, I spotted 3 orangish red glowing lights in the sky ..  There were 3 of them and they seemed to be almost in a line up and down, but as we kept driving the one on the bottom started to space itself away from the other 2 ..  We travel this rd a lot and I've never seen anything like this before..  My kids were also in the car and saw it..  As I dropped my son off and came back down the same road, they were gone!;36.1167928792568;-80.0836603715177
