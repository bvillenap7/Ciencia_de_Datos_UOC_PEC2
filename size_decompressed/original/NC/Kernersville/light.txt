3 stationary orange lights in a triangle just above horizon.;2011-11-24 18:30:00;5 minutes;3 stationary orange lights in a triangle just above horizon. I had just got home to my apartment on Thanksgiving afternoon, around dusk, after spending it with a married couple friend of mine.  I got out of my car in my apartment parking lot, looked toward the west and saw 3 glowing orange lights just above the horizon.  The 3 lights made a vertical triangle.  At first I thought they were 3 helicopters flying in formation moving across the sky but then realized they were not moving at all and were completely silent.  Thinking logically, I then thought they were a radio tower but I knew of only one radio tower in the immediate vicinity about ¾ mile away and at that moment, it could be clearly seen 90 degrees to my right.  I looked around the parking lot to see if anyone else saw the same thing I was seeing but I did not see anyone else.  After about 5 minutes of staring at this thing, one by one, the orange lights just flickered off like 3 candles.  I was looking towards the west during dusk so it could possibly be a sunset atmospheric phenomenon (I believe there was a high overcast cloudy sky that day).  However, I had never seen anything like those 3 orange lights prior to, nor since, that day.;36.1167928792568;-80.0836603715177

This is a small light that appears in one spot each night that changes diff. colors.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of star or planet?  PD));2012-05-03 22:15:00;between a hour or more;This is a small light that appears in one spot each night that changes different colors. Hello,   I’d like to report a strange object that changes colors in the sky each night.  This object is always in the same spot or a few inches off only sometimes. It will appear usually between 9:30pm-10:00pm eastern. My friends and I have watched this over the past few weeks. It will be completely dark in the same area right before the time and then it will slowly come about. It changes from blue, red, green and sometimes a bright white. When planes pass above it usually becomes dim and comes back to being bright. I was unsure of how to let someone know about this, but would like to know just what it is. We know it is not a star or a planet and not a satellite. Can someone help us know what this may be? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Two very silent and steady red lights at relatively low altitude with individual paths pass directly overhead in the night sky.;2013-12-21 20:15:00;60 seconds;Two very silent and steady red lights at relatively low altitude with individual paths pass directly overhead in the night sky. I was in a parking lot at 36.074638, -80.057982.  The objects were steady red lights, similar in appearance to lights on a distant radio tower.  In the course of about 60 seconds they moved at relatively constant speed from about 45 degrees on the horizon almost due South (when I first observed them) to about 30 degrees on the horizon almost due North, passing directly overhead.   When I first observed them to the south, they had some initial horizontal movement that brought them very close together a couple of times, and then they separated by about a degree or two, and remained roughly parallel for about 40 seconds as they passed overhead and towards the North, and one was a couple of degrees in front of the second.   I thought it was strange to see only single red lights from individual aircraft.  But I also thought that they were likely helicopters when I first observed the horizontal movements they initially made.  I fully expected that as they grew close! r, I would hear some form of engine or rotor noise.  But as they passed overhead, there was nothing but silence.   If they had been aircraft, I would have estimated their altitude to have been a couple thousand feet.  When they got to the 30 degree angle in the north sky, one red light veered off to the right at about a 45 degree angle and I lost sight of it, and about 5 seconds later, the second light disappeared, obscured by low level clouds and city lights from the horizon. I am a licensed professional civil engineer, and I happened to be in my church parking lot at the time of the observation.  I tried to take a phone video of the second half of the observation, but I only got a completely white image.;36.1167928792568;-80.0836603715177
