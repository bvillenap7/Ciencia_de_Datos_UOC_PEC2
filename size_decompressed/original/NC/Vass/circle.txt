I saw a green irredesent ball in the sky;1998-10-06 02:00:00;3 sec.;I saw a green irredesent ball in the sky it was approx. 2:00 am and I was going to work..I was at the intersection of Youngs Rd. and Hwy #1 . When you stop at the intersection you have a good view of the sky above a gas station and some trees.Something caught my eye above the station at 45 degrees . It was a green irradesent ball about the size of a street light,it came straight down, I was facing west at the intersection.It lasted 2-3 sec. and then it just went out. The way it went out was the strange thing , it seemed like it was sucked back is the best way I can discribe it , not like a light being shut off. I told my wife about it and a friend in work a few weeks later he related a similar experience. Then I heard about it on Art Bell and other peoples experiences and learned about this web site;35.2147;-79.2425999999998
