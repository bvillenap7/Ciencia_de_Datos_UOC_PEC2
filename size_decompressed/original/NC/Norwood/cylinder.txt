Cylinder, Amber Colored, no blinking lights, moving from South-to-North, extremely clear night.;2007-07-04 22:15:00;five minutes;Cylinder, Amber Colored, no blinking lights, moving from South-to-North, extremely clear night. I am a resident of  Stanly County, I have a lake house located at ((address deleted)) Lane, Norwood, North Carolina, 28128 (Randalls Church area of lake).  On the evening of July 4th, at approx 10:15pm, I returned from watching fireworks out on the lake.  (I don't drink), I was putting my boat up when a 'amber colored light' caught my eye, moving from south-to-north. I yelled at my wife to look up, she did. We both saw an object, amber in color, the shape of a cylinder .. it was a darker amber on the edges and as you looked toward the center, the it was still amber but more lighter than the edges. There were no red and green light, there were no blinking lights at all. There was no sound. From the time I saw it moving toward me, then right above me, then on to the north and then out-of-sight it took about five minutes. The Stanly County Airport in New London, NC is the closest airport. Is there any way their radar can be checked for that time and see if you can see any thing, perhaps a blimp that passed over my address between 22:15pm - 22:30pm ?.. There were hundreds of boats out on the lake (Lake Tillery) on that evening and there had to be hundreds of other people who saw the same thing I did. Can anyone tell me what this was ?  Thank you.;35.2266;-80.1396
