Bright white light flashing repeatedly in the same area of the sky for thirty to forty minutes.;2010-03-31 00:00:00;0:00-0:45;Bright white light flashing repeatedly in the same area of the sky for thirty to forty minutes. I was standing outside with my friend having a cigarette smoke at around midnight.  We were standing outside of our dorm with a clear view of the sky.  We saw something which we thought was shining in the sky and looked to be just a shooting star or something.  After about half way through our cigarette we noticed it again and that it was bigger and brighter then it was a few moments ago when we first lit our cigarette.  It was very bright at this point, unfortunately i could not tell how far it was. I started to look closer and the tip of the cone shaped object was flashing repeatedly about every half second.  We watched it for about twenty to thirty minutes in astonishment thinking we just saw an actual UFO.  Then it faded off into the distance after hovering for about thirty to forty minutes.
