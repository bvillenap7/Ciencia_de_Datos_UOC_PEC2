Bright descending burst of light.;2008-04-14 03:58:00;1-2 Sec;Bright descending burst of light. I was standing by a creek in the woods south of my apartment complex.  I was alternating looking at the stars and at the canopy of trees across the creek bank. I was looking at the sky and saw a brilliant blue/white flash traveling at a rapid rate of descent in the SSE section of the sky.  It flew in a straight line with no noise and the light remained the same brightness, velocity, and direction throughout the flight. The entire incident took less than 2 seconds.  It did not seem like any meteorite that I had ever seen before.;35.9176327846364;-79.0346460905342

I was out with my dog when I saw it behind the Chatham County, Chapel Hill, NC, Walmart near the intersection of U.S. 15-501 Hwy and Smith level Rd in Chapel Hill, NC.   The UFO seemed to blink out and only lasted a few seconds.  It's trajectory seemed to be moving at a fast slightly downward angle, as if it was losing altitude.   It appeared to be very large and was moving very fast at a low altitude.   It was completely silent and moving faster than a military attack jet.;35.9176327846364;-79.0346460905342
