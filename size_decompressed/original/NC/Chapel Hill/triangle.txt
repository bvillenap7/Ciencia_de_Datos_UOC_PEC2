Strange objects near Research Triangle Park, NC;2001-07-13 21:00:00;60min;Strange objects near Research Triangle Park, NC It was about 9pm when my boyfriend and I (both students at a local university)  were driving home from the grocery store.  To the right of the car, we both noticed something strange in the sky three triangular objects.  What drew our attention to them was the fact that there seemed to be a center object (larger than the others) hovering, while the 2 objects surrounding it moved rapidly from either side of it. These objects had lights at all 3 corners (two red, one blue) and a larger white light in the center.  What was so amazing about these objects was their ability to hover, as well as their incredible speed.  We stopped and got out of our car to get a better look, but within about 5-10min they were gone.  A little later in the evening, closer to 10pm, we went out again to see if we could spot these objects.  As we drove on the interstate closer to Raleigh, they appeared again.  It seemed to me that we saw between 3-5 of these at various locations. Again, we got out of the car (with camera in hand) and one of the objects flew fairly close to us to allow a better look.  This object appeared to be similar to the center object we had seen earlier.  Also triangular, it appeared to have two very bright white lights at the top-most point, with red lights on the bottom two.  In the center was again a larger white light, and right above these were two strange markings of white light (resembeling <<).  This object came close to us, but made absolutely no sound whatsoever. In total, over about 1-2 hours, we witnessed between 3-5 of these objects.  While I was skeptical, I just can't explain what it was that we saw.  Another strange thing was that there was a much higher amount of air traffic (airplanes) in the area than we normally see. Though I can't be sure, some did appear to be military.;35.9176327846364;-79.0346460905342
Flying Triangle;2008-01-15 19:00:00;1-2 minutes;Flying Triangle Around 7 PM est on January 18, 2008 I witnessed a large triangular shaped object on Estes Drive in Chapel Hill, NC. I was driving at 35 mph and spotted a large object with a bright white light surrounded by two larger red lights hovering just above the treetops surrounding Estes Drive Elementary School. It was approximately 200-250 ft. in the air.  There is a small airport close by, but this was not a plane. The object was moving extremely slowly in a straight line.  It made no sound, and the lights were steady, and did not blink. As it's a two lane road and I had traffic approaching and traffic coming up behind me I could not stop or turn around to get a closer look.  When I reached the end of Estes Drive, at the corner of Estes and East Franklin (approx 1/4 mile from the sighting) I could see a pair of lights in the Southern sky splitting apart, one went to the left (the East) while the other rose to the Northwest.  The Northwesterly object continued rising and then switched course to the East.  I'm providing a google map link to the location of the sighting  http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&msa=0&ll=35.941254,-79.044614&spn=0.014662,0.030899&t=h&z=15&om=1&msid=115158618809161062506.000443ccc63531c403d95;35.9176327846364;-79.0346460905342
Dark Triangle with red lights flying close to ground.  Made abrupt turn.  Made no sound.;2013-04-02 03:00:00;3 minutes;Dark Triangle with red lights flying close to ground.  Made abrupt turn.  Made no sound. While working patrol, checking stores after hours, I observed a triangular shaped aircraft operating north to south.  The aircraft made an abrupt left turn and traveled east, which was within 1/4 mile or so from my location.  The aircraft was less than 1000 feet off the ground also. The aircraft was very dark with minimal lighting.  It had three very dimly lit red lights on each corner, in what most would consider a triangle.  The aircraft's lights never blinked, just remained dimly lit. As the aircraft passed in front of me, it made zero sound.  I figured it was a stealth fighter or bomber.  I briefly spoke to a few people from work.  One stated it could have been a drone. I did call the sighting in by phone and it's recorded at our 911 center.  I'm not one to believe in Alien spacecraft ... This made the hair on my neck stand up and I feel it's worth sharing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
