As i got up to get a drink I noticed a light in the sky as i stepped closer to the window i noticed 3 red lights in a triangle and as my eyes ajusted I began to see the outline of the object, a circle.  Me and my sis hollered at my brother to come see the UFO. We opened the sliding glass door to the right to go out to listen.  There was no sound.  The object was right above our trees in the front yard.  We expect the object was very close to the size of a football field. It slowly moved away revealing it was a disc shaped UFO with a line of lights around the whole ship. I would guess it was moving about 1-5 mph.  Our parents were sleeping at the time by the time we woke them it was so far away it could have been a airplane to them.  But for me and my siblings it was the closest encounter we have ever had.  I will always look to the sky...hoping this time i have a camera.   Note: This happened sometime in the summer of 96. Not sure of the month or day.

Orb moving over the nighttime Chapel Hill suburbs;2020-04-23 22:00:00;1 minute;Orb moving over the nighttime Chapel Hill suburbs Was out with a group of friends to watch the meteor shower. Never saw any meteors, up and ahead of us we spotted a white circular (object?) shape move east. it was very very high up and hard to discern what it was, but it wasn't blinking like a plane and it was way too high and far away to be a drone.  (And no, it wasn't a meteor - one of the people is super nerdy into this stuff and they didn't know what this was)  It moved organically - a bit strange - as if someone was drawing on the sky with a laser pointer.  It proceeded in that direction for about a minute, second by second  a different person in our group noticing it until it became so dim it was gone.  About 10 minutes later, we saw a bright white flash / explosion around the same area it originated.  Never seen anything like this!;35.9176327846364;-79.0346460905342
