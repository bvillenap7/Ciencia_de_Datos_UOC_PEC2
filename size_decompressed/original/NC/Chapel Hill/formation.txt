Multi-colored light array drifting low, pattern shapes and colors in RBG. 15/501 S towards Pittsboro, NC;2019-10-05 19:30:00;1 minute;Multi-colored light array drifting low, pattern shapes and colors in RBG. 15/501 S towards Pittsboro, NC Was driving south on 15/501 following a friend to get pizza up the road past Manns Chapel. About 7:30-7:40 pm. I have text messages to corroborate the day/time even though it has been a year. An array of lights multi-colored red/green/blue drifted into view moving slowish and appearing fairly low in the sky.  The lights seemed to change colors and moved in a sequenced pattern almost mandalic effect. Drifted into view and hung over the highway for a few moments, the array was floating parallell to the ground in a disc/rectangular formation (though no actual physical substance seemed to tie the lights together). It was dusk/ almost dark so perspective was weird, but the tree line ended up obscuring it from my vision after driving by. Seemed to be traveling fairly slowly (less than 50mph), and seemed to be headed in the opposite-ish direction (north). My buddy was just as freaked out as I was when we arrived at our destination a few minutes later. He drove in a! separate vehicle and was in front of me by about 200 yards.  It has been on my mind for the past year. One of the most unusual things I’ve ever experienced. Found this site after hanging around a Reddit subthread and realized someone else reported this in NORTH chapel hill same day same time- I was south of chapel hill but I (and my friend) can corroborate this sighting. My phone was almost dead and it happened so quickly while driving I couldn’t get a video or pic.  I would also love to know if anyone else saw this, or a light array like this elsewhere and what the prevailing theories are on it!;35.9176327846364;-79.0346460905342
Cluster of UFO’s seen close to Chapel Hill, NC;2019-10-05 19:40:00;3-5 minutes;Cluster of UFO’s seen close to Chapel Hill, NC My wife, myself, and my 2 boys were driving on I40E about a mile before the New Hope Church Rd exit at around 7:40pm and saw a cluster of what looked like 8-10 crafts that were changing colors from red to green, blue, bright white, etc and they colors changed at the same time across all crafts. At first we thought it was helicopters but soon realized with their movements and colors changing at identical times it could not be a fleet of helicopters.  We passed by them as they hovered above and about 2 minutes later I looked through the rear glass of our vehicle and they had moved into a circular formation.  I had never seen anything like it it my life and wish I had thought to pull out my camera. After scouring the internet trying to find if others had reported the same thing as what we saw I noticed there was a video that was posted this week from some lights off the coast of Wilmington, NC, and I honestly believe these were the same lights that we saw.  Would love to know if others around this areas have reported the same sightings;35.9176327846364;-79.0346460905342
