Moving to the beat of the music playing from a cell phone.  The mother craft stayed over a close by cow pasture.  The others moved west.  The moon was full and surrounded of clouds shaped actually like the milky way galaxy.  The mother craft shot a bright beam of light then dimmed a little over the cow pasture.;35.7705;-78.2057
