Silvery Daylight Orb.;2014-04-05 18:00:00;40-60 seconds;Silvery Daylight Orb I was outside at work about 6 pm.  It was still daylight and a mostly sunny sky.  I noticed the sun reflecting off the surface of the object.   As I observed it, it was moving towards me and in a somewhat westerly direction.  It seemed fairly high but it's hard to say without knowing how big it was.  The speed was moderate, I didn't notice it moving particularly fast or slow. It was an orb shaped object, obviously silvery or chrome metallic, and as I said before strongly reflecting the sunlight.  I didn't see any wings and it did not look like a plane or helicopter.  I didn't hear any noise, but then again it was very high. I looked away for just a second, and when I looked back up, it had disappeared.  I waited for a few minutes to see if it reappeared and it never did.;34.7221000000004;-76.7543000000003
