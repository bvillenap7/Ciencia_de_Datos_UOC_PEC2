Triangle, three large dim rectangle lights running down the left and right sides.;2005-04-04 21:50:00;10 seconds;Triangle, three large dim rectangle lights running down the left and right sides. The object was triangle with six large rectangle lights three on the left and three on the right. They ran down the sides and looked equal in size. There was also one round light at the bottom in the back center of the craft. The light was so dim it was barly visable and at first I thought it eas a large white bird and the light was a reflection off the wings. Then as I focused better I noticed it was not a bird but a craft of some kind. The craft moved silently out of sight heading north northwest.;34.7221000000004;-76.7543000000003
