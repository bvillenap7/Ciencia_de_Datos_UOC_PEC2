Some very bright some not so much. I saw many objects moving very fast changing direction and vanishing. Some were moving very slowly and none were planes.  You can tell the difference.  I have never seen anything like it in my life.  It was more that the object was a light rather than it had lights. Changing from very bright to vanishing.  Eight plus objects.  I have a video...;34.7221000000004;-76.7543000000003
Unbelievably fast light streaks by!;2020-10-26 19:12:00;3 seconds;Unbelievably fast light streaks by! At approximately 7:12 pm tonight I walked out onto my second floor porch to get some air and saw something I've never seen in my 58 years. My porch faces south. Suddenly, coming from the east, I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a bright yellowish/white small light at about a 40% elevation. But the speed!!! As it went, it seemed to be getting further away slightly and on a very slightly downward trajectory. There seemed to be a few much smaller lights close behind it. Sparks? It made no noise that I could hear. It was visible for 3 seconds but went more than halfway (maybe even 70%) across my field of vision in that time. I literally had to keep moving my head around to the right to keep my eye on it. I know I'm not explaining the speed well but suffice it to say I have never seen anything move like that. No shooting star. No airplane. Nothing. I was just standing there with my mouth hanging open. At that point I lost sight of it. I waited a few ! minutes to see if there would be more but there weren't. I'm a 58 year old, retired medical assistant. I was the only one present. I just wanted to report this in case others do also.;34.7221000000004;-76.7543000000003
