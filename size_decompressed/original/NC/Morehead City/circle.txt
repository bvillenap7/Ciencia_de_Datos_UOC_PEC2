Still, orange light over Morehead City.;2017-07-13 21:00:00;10 minutes;Still. orange light over Morehead City My boyfriend and I were sitting on our front porch around 9pm when we noticed an orange, circular light over Morehead City.  We live across the Newport River on the water and could see it well over the town.  It never moved, but would disappear quickly and reappear in the same spot a minute or two later.   This went on for approximately 10 minutes and then it did not reappear.  We tried to find a logical reason but there were no clouds in the sky (we could see other stars) and a drone would have been too small for us to see at the distance we were at.  Hoping maybe someone else saw this as well.;34.7221000000004;-76.7543000000003
