Big orange / red light in northwest sky in Rockwell NC USA;2021-01-29 20:08:00;15min;Big orange / red light in northwest sky in Rockwell NC USA We were driving home and I saw a orange/ reddish color round light in the North Western sky. It just sat there no movement  It almost looked like a planet but it was way to big to be Mars. Mars was in the other direction anyway. My husband pulled over and we sat and looked at the Light / object for about 15 min. We had groceries in the car so we went home.  After we got home we looked in North west direction and the light/ object was gone.  I called my niece to tell her and I asked her , that when she drives past the place we saw it over could she look and see if she sees anything. She called to tell me that she pulled into the parking lot where we observed it and she didn’t see anything.  What we saw We have never seen anything like it. The only thing I could think it looks like is maybe an asteroid.  But whatever it was it was sure unidentified I am a CNA and my husband is a retired truck driver. We don’t drink or take any type meds.;35.5518;-80.4253
