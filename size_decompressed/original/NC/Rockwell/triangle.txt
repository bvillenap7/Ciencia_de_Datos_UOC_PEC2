Driving from Salisbury, NC after dinner, I was asked by one of the passengers in my car to look up and tell her what that big light was. I looked and was shocked.  It was quite large, too close for satellite or star, and too big and usual for aircraft. It hovered with no sound.  We continued driving, keeping our eyes on this light. When I arrived at my friend's home, I pulled into her driveway and turned off the headlights. We watched the lit object for about 20 seconds, and then it zipped away with no sound. I do mean zipped. No aircraft can hover in the air and take off and away at the speed we witnessed. There was no gradual speed, but instant speed. And then it was gone.  We then all dropped our jaws and realized that we had witnessed something we'd never seen before.;35.5518;-80.4253
