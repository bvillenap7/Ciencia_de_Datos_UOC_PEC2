Black helicopter following 2 orange lights (no sound except from helicopter).;2014-04-17 22:15:00;6 seconds;Black helicopter following 2 orange lights (no sound except from helicopter) I was sitting on my bed with my laptop when suddenly I heard the sound of a low flying helicopter.  Helicopters are common to fly in the area, and I like to check them out whenever I can.   So I stepped outside and listened to the noise in the direction it was coming from.  I saw a blacked out helicopter with a red light on its tail and a strobe on its front.  Okay... that's strange for a helicopter.  I had this feeling it was trying to be incognito. Then, I looked at a bright orange light ahead of the helicopter.  I immediately ran into the driveway to take a better look, then I noticed another orange light a great distance from the first orange light, except this one was more faint.  The lights moved at the same speed, same direction heading northwest, towards Faith, NC.  The lights never flashed.  Nor was there any sound.  Only the helicopter was making sound.  Planes fly around here all day and night, so I can detect aircraft real fast, but not these orange lights.  Something about them stumped me and I couldn't ever come to a conclusion what they were.  I have never seen anything like this before. Seconds after the sighting I ran inside and explained to my mom what I saw, and quickly drew a picture of what I saw.  I'm willing to show the picture as well.;35.5518;-80.4253
