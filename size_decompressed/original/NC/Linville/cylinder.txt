Orange balls of light seen flying over Avery County, NC.;2011-11-02 19:15:00;1.5 hours;Orange balls of light seen flying over Avery County, NC. On the evening of 11/2/11 a neighbor a few houses to the south called and asked me to look at the orange ball above his house.  It was 7:15pm, I went out and looked south and saw the large orange ball about 400 feet above his home.  My friend asked me to tape this but my camera was not charged.  I got out my binoculars and looked and saw an object that looked like an upside down lampshade, thinner at the bottom and wider at the top.  It was generating orange, red and yellow lights.  It left moving south to north. I asked my neighbor to call back if he saw it again and he did at 8:10.  By this time I had my camera charged and I filmed the second object moving south to north for a couple of minutes.  Another object appeared at 8:30 and I filmed it moving silently for several minutes.  About this time I spotted the fourth orb and also got it on tape. I thanked my neighbor and asked him to call me back if another appeared.   We have not seen another incident since.;36.0678;-81.8749
