Bright green orb falling from sky in the same fashion as a shooting star.;2005-10-31 02:55:00;4 SECS;Bright green orb falling from sky in the same fashion as a shooting star. The object looked similar to a shooting star except that it was moving slower than that of a shooting star and it was bright green in color.  It was only visible for a matter of seconds and it left a faint trail falling behind it.   The object resembled a flare except they have not been seen ascending, only descending.  This is at least the third incident that they have been sighted in this city in the last two months.   My friend and I saw this object on 10/31/2005 at 02:55 in the morning from the car.   Three co-workers of mine have also seen what sounds to be the same thing on two previous occasions.   There was also a report made to the local Police Department of two strange circles appearing in a yard the day after the first sighting by my co-workers. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor, we suspect.  One of two dramatic meteors on this date.  They may have been part of the Leonid Meteor Shower, which peaks on November 17-18.  PD));35.6857;-82.0210000000004
