Blue/green light in the P.G. area of McDowell county;2006-02-09 18:00:00;few seconds;Blue/green light in the P.G. area of McDowell county I was driving west on highway 70 at approximately 7pm and was on my cell phone with a friend.  I looked up and saw a blue/green colored light toward my center of vision and it moved to the right. It could have lasted longer than a few seconds, but I was driving and couldn't follow where it went.  It didn't flash or pulse. I mentioned this to my friend and she said at least 2 people she works with have seen it as well.;35.6857;-82.0210000000004

Out of nowhere what we thought was fireworks or something after looking closely we seen at least 30 reddish orange oval shaped lights around 600ft in the air and kept going up in the air, over a duration of 10 mins they started disappearing.   While the lights was in the air they were changing formation.   I tried to get an image but they would not show up on the camera before I could get it the camera they was all gone, I wanted to get an image captured so people would believe us.;35.6857;-82.0210000000004
