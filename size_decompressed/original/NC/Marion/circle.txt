Lights with no aviation lights visable every night with large binoculars;2007-04-01 21:00:00;5 Minutes;Lights with no aviation lights visable every night with large binoculars I have a pair of Celestron Skymaster 25x100 binoculars and on or about September 1, 2006 at around 9:00pm I was stargazing and tracking airplanes across the sky.  At one point I was examining the sky at about 2 or three inches at a time.  I was looking towards the northwest and I saw a blue light with no aviation lights flew from nw towards the southeast.  I thought it was strange but when on with my observing.  About 1 minute later I saw 2 more identical lights and then more and more.  I saw at least 6 to 8 identical lights crossing the sky.  These binoculars are powerful enough to see galaxies and other messier objects.  At first I thought these lights could be sattelites but the research I have done says there are only about 14 sattelites that can be observed from earth and they are only visable for a few seconds at a time as they tumble in and out of the sun's rays.  I tracked all of these objects from horizon to horizon.  Since then I can go out every night and if I am patient enough, I can see these lights every time.  Have you ever heard of this phenomena.

Illuminated Orb hovering over Marion, NC- does this have to do with the non- existent Military Base behind Baxter.;2013-11-01 21:00:00;35-45 minutes;Illuminated Orb hovering over Marion, NC- does this have to do with the non- existent Military Base behind Baxter. My HUSBAND AND I were noticing a bright light in the sky that was not moving.  So we grabbed our binocs and began looking for the object still in the sky.   As we were watching this object, others started to stop and pull over to get a better look.  No one could believe their eyes..  A ball of many many lights which were illuminating the objects around them.  Someone said that the various planes that were now in flight to ck it out (this area is not a flight pattern) some men stated that the airplanes that seem to be responding to the globe- kept going around it or under it. I have never seen so many planes...  Not sure what we were all seeing but we do know it was not a planet and it was not weather balloons.   Anyone have an idea?;35.6857;-82.0210000000004
