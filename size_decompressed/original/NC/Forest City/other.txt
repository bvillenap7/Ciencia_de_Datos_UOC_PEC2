My family and I had just drove up to my house after returning from the store around 7:30p.m. We went in the huse but, I had to go back outside to the car for something. I saw a Solid Black FISH shaped object in the sky coming from the southwest or sort of more westerd. It had no lights nor any sound, only silence. It was traveling very slow NorthEastward or sort of more Northward. The object was very low and the size was three times as wide as my house and double in length. A few minutes after the craft/U.F.O. was almost out of sight there came a military aircarft following its path in which it came. Now the military craft was very loud with lights on it. We watched them both until they were out of view. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  One of four, seemingly serious-minded, reports from same witness.   PD));35.325;-81.846
