TRIANGLE SHAPED SHADOW BLOCKS OUT STARS;1996-01-01 21:00:00;4-5 minutes;TRIANGLE SHAPED SHADOW BLOCKS OUT STARS FIRST OF ALL, THE ONLY PERSON I EVER TOLD OF THIS EVENT WAS MY WIFE. I AM CURRENTLY EMPLOYED AS A ((law enforcement officer)), BUT AT THE TIME I WAS WORKING FOR ((deleted)) YOUTH CAMP. I HAD JUST GRADUATED COLLEGE AND THIS WAS MY FIRST REAL JOB. I WAS ABOUT TO GET OFF WORK AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 HOURS.  IT HAD BEEN COLD AND WINDY ALL DAY, BUT THE SKY WAS CLEAR THAT NIGHT.  I WAS WALKING FROM MY WORKSITE TO MY VEHICLE WHEN I FIRST KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.  THE WIND, WHICH HAD BLOWN ALL DAY SUDDENLY STOPPED.  THERE WAS PLENTY OF LIGHT DUE TO THE CLEAR SKY AND THE MOONLIGHT.  WHEN THE WIND STOPPED BLOWING, EVERYTHING BECAME QUIET.  EVEN THE USUAL INSECT AND BIRD SOUNDS STOPPED.  THEN, I OBSERVED A SHADOW MOVE OVER ME, JUST LIKE WHEN A AIRPLANE FLIES ACROSS THE SUN.  I LOOKED UP AND OBSERVED A TRIANGLE SHAPED OBJECT MOVING ACROSS THE SKY ABOVE ME.  THE OBJECT WAS COMPLETELY BLACK, AND BLOCKED OUT THE STARS AND MOON.  IT MADE NO SOUND AT ALL.  IT SEEMED TO HOVER, THEN MOVE, THEN HOVER, THEN MOVE.  FINALLY, IT TURNED WHILE HOVERING, THEN IT QUIETLY MOVED OUT OF MY FIELD OF VISION.  WHEN IT DISAPPEARED, THE WIND STARTED BLOWING AGAIN, AND ALL THE USUAL NOISES OF THE FORREST RETURNED. I WAS UNABLE TO JUDGE ITS SIZE OR ALTITUDE BECAUSE I HAD NO REFERENCE BY WHICH TO JUDGE IT. HOWEVER, IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO BLOCK OUT SEVERAL STARS AT A TIME, AND CAST A SHADOW ON THE GROUND.  ALTHOUGH I HAVE WORKED AS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER, DEPUTY SHERIFF, AND NOW A POLICE OFFICER, I HAVE NEVER BEEN AS AFFRAID AS I WAS THAT NIGHT.  WHEN I GOT HOME, MY WIFE NOTICED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING BOTHERING ME. I TRIED TO CONVINCE MYSELF THAT I HAD IMMAGINED IT, BUT WHEN I RETURNED TO WORK, OTHER EMPLOYEES INFORMED ME THAT THEY HAD ALSO OBSERVED IT. EMPLOYEES THAT WERE OFF DUTY IN THE ON SITE LIVING QUARTERS REPORTED THAT AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE OBJECT WAS SEEN, THE SATALITE TELEVISION LOST ITS SIGNAL FOR APPROXIMATELY 4-5 MINUTES.  I TRIED TO PUT THE INCIDENT BEHIND ME, BUT I NEVER FELT COMFORTABLE WORKING IN THE FORREST AGA! IN. I SO ON RESIGNED MY POSITION FOR PERSONAL REASONS.  I WAS ALSO AN AVID HIKER AND CAMPER. I HAVE NOT SPENT A NIGHT IN THE FORREST SINCE. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is not an approximation.  PD));34.600576923077;-78.6852999999999
