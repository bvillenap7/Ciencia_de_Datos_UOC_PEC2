A metallic looking large Disk shaped Object landed in the Fields,and nothing ever grew again.;1972-06-30 21:00:00;30 minutes;A metallic looking large Disk shaped Object landed in the Fields,and nothing ever grew again. On that night, my Sister called for me to come outside, claimed that UFO was coming down into the Fields.As I entered the back Yard,8 of my Family Members had gathered.My Sister and Brother in Law,a very solid Citizen,who insisted he was not seeing this,as his place of work would never understand this.They lived in a Mobile Home,in the back of my Parents Land.Also present were my Mother and Father,he was retired Military,and had seen a lot.Another Sister was out there,and 2 more of my Siblings,myself being around 30 at the Time.The Neighbors from next door came out,very solid People,they had Company,which also came to look at the Object. One of them had a Radio,and Reports started coming,and the Announcer was laughing it off.My Sister and Brother in Law would know the Year,both are close to my Age,and they remember well.It was the eeriest Feeling all of us had ever experienced,as we stood there and watched the huge,silent Object slowly descent unto Farmland.It was a dark silver,metallic looking Disk,with rotating Lights of different Colors,red and Orange,when it got close to the Ground,there was like a humming Noise coming from the Craft.It could not possibly be a Plane,as Conway had no Airport,it's just a small Country Town,on the Eastern Seaboard.All man made Possibilities were out,that much we knew.I never saw anything like this before, or ever again.We all agreed to keep silent about what we saw,for Fear of Ridicule.I need to add,that a Farmer reported an Area in his Field burned,and nothing would grow on it again.My Sister and I recently talked about it,and we know that what we saw was not of this Earth. I realize that it is way to late to investigate,but I want someone to know it happened,and I wish there was a way to find out just how many others saw what we did,and that Field were it landed had to be radioactive. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.4134;-77.2516
