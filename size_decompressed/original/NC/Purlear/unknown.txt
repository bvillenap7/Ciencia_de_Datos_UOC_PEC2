for 2 hours observed object moving slightly colored lights blinking randomly;2003-10-18 01:00:00;2+ hours;for 2 hours observed object moving slightly colored lights blinking randomly We saw bright flashing lights of different colors. It seemed to be shaped like a boomerang or triangle but couldn't really see it clearly. The lights flashed in random paterns and the object stayed almost in the same place for the entire 2 hours we watched. It would move slightly from left to right or up and down and sometimes in circular patern. At on point what appeared to be a shooting star flew across the sky at a high rate of speed and stopped at or went directly into the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the sighting is not inconsistent with the sighting of a twinkling star.  However, that is just a guess.  PD));36.1961;-81.348
