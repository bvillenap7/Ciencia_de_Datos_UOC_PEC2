4 Circling Bright Lights;2006-05-29 20:45:00;3 minutes;4 Circling Bright Lights As I was taking out the trash I noticed 4 very bright white lights in the southeast sky about 30 to 40 degrees above the horizon. They were moving about randomly in a small area sort of making circles and moves like figure eights. I called my wife out to look and just as she stepped out, the lights got very bright, like car head lights 100 feet away. This lasted about 15 seconds before the lights dimmed again to when I first saw them, and then they all moved off to the east going very, very fast and I lost sight of them going over some trees. There was no noise, and the lights were much brighter than the couple of stars visible as the sky was still a little light from sunset. I have seen many airplanes and helicopters in my life, and these were not normal aircraft, nor meteors, nor lightning.;36.1961;-81.348
