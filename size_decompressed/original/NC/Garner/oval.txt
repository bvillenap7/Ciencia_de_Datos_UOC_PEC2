Saw UFO between a double-rainbow outside a restaurant.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible lens flare, we suspect.  PD));2016-08-06 19:30:00;5 seconds;Saw UFO between a double-rainbow outside a restaurant. It was raining that day in the evening while the sun was out.  A double rainbow formed outside the restaurant we were in, and my father and I went outside to take a few pictures on our phones.  Afterwards, we realized a UFO was in one of our pictures, in between both rainbows.  To be exact, the UFO was on the other end of the rainbow.  It was curious how one end of both rainbows started right outside the restaurant on the road, meters from where we were.  The UFO was oval and white and was there for a few seconds only. ((NUFORC Note:  The photo shows an object, which appears to be almost transparent, or diaphonous.  We assume that it is either some type of reflection, or perhaps a lens flare.  We doubt that it is an alien spacecraft, but we cannot be certain.  PD));35.6827999999996;-78.5976999999988
