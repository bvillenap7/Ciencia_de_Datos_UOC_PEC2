Flat square I only saw the bottom it was about 60 ft above my head;1993-08-25 02:00:00;3 minutes;Flat square I only saw the bottom it was about 60 ft above my head It was 2am end of Aug 1993. I was laying on a pullout sleeper couch with my girlfriend. She looked up and saw a light through the blinds. she asked me what it was. I reached up and opened the blinds and saw 2 red/orange lights attached to a huge object floating very slowly over the tree tops. I immediately got up and ran outside, trying to wake up everyone in the house as I ran. It came over the top of the house as I ran out the front door. It had bracket looking symbols on the bottom *[   ]* with the lights on either side of it. the top and bottom of the brackets were bent at about 45 degrees as opposed to the 90 degree brackets. This craft was about the size of the house and didn't make a sound I never saw the top of it only the bottom. I ran underneath it and it was very close as I got to the street I picked up a stone and threw it at the craft. I never heard the stone hit the craft nor did I hear the stone land. The craft flew North until it went over the hill and outran me. Even when I was viewing it from behind as it flew away I did not see a top on it. I went back inside and no one woke up. No one heard me yelling for them to wake up either. I spoke with my girlfriend and asked her why she didn't come outside. She said she was scared. I thought about the stone and the fact that no one heard me yelling and thought that the craft had some kind of noise canceling technology on it.

Strange orbs moving in sky over Highway 70 in Garner, NC.  ((anonymous report));2019-02-16 20:00:00;5 minutes;Strange orbs moving in sky over highway 70 in Garner, North Carolina. Driving down highway 70 in Garner at 8pm EST.  In they sky, there were several orbs, white in color, hovering like bugs in the sky between the clouds.  They were only moving in the same area.  It seemed they were in a circular area and wouldn't move out of that area.  They were seen from Clayton to Garner.   If I had to guess, I would say there were 7 or 8 lights, moving like orbs.
