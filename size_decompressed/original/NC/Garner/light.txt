Bright white light moves across sky and stops suddenly and reverses;2007-08-02 21:30:00;1 min;Bright white light moves across sky and stops suddenly and reverses A bright white light kind of like a plane or a planet looks and it was moving very fast in a horizontal position from south to north, at apx. 45 degrees.  I was only surprised by the speed it was moving until it stopped and immediately reversed and went back the same way it had come. I knew no plane or object known to me could physically do this.  It went out of my line of vision obstructed by trees.  I moved and looked for it but it was gone.;35.6827999999996;-78.5976999999988

I was driving in my car on 401 when i saw an object that i can best describe it looked like an orange star. It looked to be close to the ground though judging an object with no real knowledge of the size it's hard to tell but I'm sure it was close.  It was traveling in the same direction I was.  I pulled over at a bowling alley off the road to get a better look it changed direction slowly then bolted off another direction out of site.;35.6827999999996;-78.5976999999988

Odd flashing lights.;2014-11-08 20:00:00;1-2 minutes;Odd flashing lights On the evening of Nov. 8th, around 8PM, located in Johnston County, North Carolina, I witnessed odd lights in the sky, traveling out of the south into the north.  The lights flashed irregularly and at a very fast pace, unlike any aircraft lights I have seen in the past.  The lights would flash and then go dark from some distance, and flash again and go dark, for what seemed to be the same distance.   It repeated this for five sequences of flashing fading in brightness each time until it went dark.  The manner that it “went dark” to me resembled the same way a satellite dimes and fades until it can no longer be seen, so I believe its altitude was very high and fast.  The initial flash was sufficiently bright enough in my peripheral vision to grab my attention the second seemed to be equally as bright and it dimmed from that point on.;35.6827999999996;-78.5976999999988

Went outside to let my dog out to use the bathroom. I usually look up at the stars naturally being curious if I would see anything but not actually trying to find a UFO.  I noticed an airplane headed left to my direction until suddenly a bright white orb appeared.  I noticed it was gliding across the sky very fast, faster then the airplane.  The white orb did not have blinking lights except for the one time when I noticed it and I felt like it noticed me and flashed red. After that it continued to move across the sky until it got I line with may sight. Another object appeared and they seemed to be in sync somewhat. The orb coming from the right direction went above the first orb I saw and they both proceeded to move in upward direction very high in the sky. They both eventually came to a stop and remained for about 5-10 minutes just moving in a vertical direction, up and down very fluidly. I ran inside to grab my phone and managed to get :30 sec of video footag! e before the object came down to about horizon level and proceeded to move across the sky until out of my sight.;35.6827999999996;-78.5976999999988
