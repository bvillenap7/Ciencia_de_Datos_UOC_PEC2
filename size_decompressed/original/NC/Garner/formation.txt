I was out for an evening run on 4/8/14 at aprox. 9:45pm when, nearing the end of my street, I noticed three low, stationary objects in the SE sky. Each object consisted of 3 horizontal, white lights.  I didn't think much of it at first and continued to the end of the street and turned around.   I removed my ear buds and began walking back while observing the three objects.  The left-most object began to pulsate, fading completely out of sight and then fading back into full view.  As it faded in and out, I noticed that the fading seemed to be accompanied by a strange cloud formation around the object.   All the while I heard NOTHING.  Being only a few miles from the Johnston County airport, we frequently see low flying aircraft, but these were completely void of any sound.   I was completely awestruck and this point, standing in the middle of my neighborhood street in full-body goosebumps.  I then noticed that the objects weren't actually stationary and that they were moving VERY slowly to the south.  I looked down to grab my phone, fumbling, trying to get the camera ready for video and when I looked up, all three objects had vanished.  I scanned the sky for a minute or two and finally saw them drifting out of view heading south. It was one of the strangest and profound moments of my lifetime.
