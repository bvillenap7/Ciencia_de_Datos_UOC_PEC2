There were red lights on the bottom and the top was glowing red. It was a beatiful sight. It was over tree tops.;35.6827999999996;-78.5976999999988
7 Red Lights.;2014-01-15 19:00:00;5 minutes;7 Red Lights. I was heading back home from the food lion on the intersection of 10-10 & 401.  I was taking 401 to get on lake wheeler rd.   All of a sudden my mom noticed a line of red lights. There were about 6-7 of them.  All moving together @ at constant rate.  At first the seem to be airplanes but they object changed slightly in direction & all the lights moved together.   Many cars were parked off the road watching.   There seemed to be other things following it, maybe actual airplanes.  After following it for a bit it headed toward Cary/Downtown Raleigh.;35.6827999999996;-78.5976999999988
