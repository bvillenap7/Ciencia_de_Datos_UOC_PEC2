Two flashing orbs.;2014-03-01 17:45:00;1 minute;Two flashing orbs. Initially, a single craft was observed..  It was moving quickly and flashed intermittently.  It converged with another craft of identical appearance and movement characteristics.   They seemed to move through the atmosphere without regard to the aerodynamic principles that we understand and require for modern aircraft.  They were able to change direction quickly and did not behave like normal aircraft.  I hold a private pilot license and feel fairly well versed in aerodynamic principles.  These objects were not subject to these principles.   As the two objects moved to the north, they flashed a few times, and then completely disappeared.;35.6827999999996;-78.5976999999988
