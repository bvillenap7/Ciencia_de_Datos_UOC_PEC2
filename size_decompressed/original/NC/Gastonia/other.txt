WHITE SILVERY OBJECT NORTHWARD BOUND WITH GREAT SPEED, NO SOUND AND FLUTTERING MOTION.;2003-11-30 15:41:00;8 - 10 seconds;WHITE SILVERY OBJECT NORTHWARD BOUND WITH GREAT SPEED, NO SOUND AND FLUTTERING MOTION. NOV. 30:   I HAD JUST LAID DOWN IN MY HAMMOCK FACING EAST.  A WHITE SILVERY SHAPE FLEW DIRECTLY OVERHEAD DUE NORTH.  AT FIRST IMPRESSION, I THOUGHT IT WAS A HIGH FLYING AIRPLANE.  THERE WAS NO SOUND.  THE SHAPE WAS FAIRLY INDESTINGUISHABLE, BUT THE COLORATION SEEMED TO BE JUST LIKE THAT OF THE MOON IN DAYLIGHT.  THE THING THAT CAUGHT MY EYE WAS THE FLUTTERING OR SIDE-TO-SIDE MOTION THAT THE VEHICLE MADE - NOT UNLIKE A LEAF FLOATING, OR A FEATHER EVEN.  EXCEPT FOR THE TERRIFIC SPEED, AND THE CONTINUATION OF FORWARD MOTION, I WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IT A SECOND THOUGHT.  BUT, AIRPLANES JUST DON'T FLY LIKE WHAT I SAW.;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
