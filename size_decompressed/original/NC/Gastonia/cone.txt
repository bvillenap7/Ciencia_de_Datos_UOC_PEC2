3 cones hover over back yard/trees.;2013-09-22 03:30:00;1-2 minutes;3 cones hover over back yard/trees. Hi,  I am from Miami, by way of Cuba, and believe me when I say I have seen some odd things in my day, but this one beats them all. I suffer from severe sleep issues and often fall asleep at work as a result. So I am up late, all the time.  That night I was unable to sleep as I had eaten too much quacamole for my 10pm snack.   I was standing in my cocina looking for some food, when I noticed some lights shining through the woods into my back yard.  I watched in amazement as 3 cone shaped objects appeared just over the tops of the trees.   I dropped the fudge cycle I was about to eat, and ran outside.  I saw these 3 things hover silently for about a minute, the dogs were going nuts, whining and crying.  Then just like that they disappeared! Not sure what I saw but I told my brother and he suggested I contact you guys.   What do you think this could be?  I am really scared they will come back and I don't know what to do!;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
