dim triangular lights headed south.;2010-11-07 02:47:00;10-15 seconds;dim triangular lights headed south. I took my dog out, like I do every night, to go use the bathroom.  Its been very cold, roughly around 31-30°F.  As I am standing there in the dark waiting for her to finish, I am looking up, staring at the big dipper when suddenly I see a triangle shaped craft moving at about 50-75mph, roughly around 1000ft above me, dim white lights as if it was attempting to not be seen.  Moving in the typical triangular formation.   I am always interested in anything related to UFOs and watch a lot of programs on television about them, so I know I am looking at something similar to what some people have seen.  It was roughly, I'd have to say, 50-100ft across, width-wise and from nose to back, 150-200ft.  Dim white lights, larger than any of the stars around it.  Moving in a southward direction.   The event lasted about 10-15 seconds, enough time for me to whisper some random profanities to myself and then huddle back inside. I wish it had lingered for a bit so I could photograph or video it, but it seemed determined on flying overhead.;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
Very very strange anomoly of many flying objects, very close together, large in numbers, and dissappearing into nowhere.;2012-01-01 00:15:00;6 minutes;Very very strange anomoly of many flying objects, very close together, large in numbers, and dissappearing into nowhere. 12:30 a.m. 1/1/12  Just saw many many strange red objects in the sky – atleast 25 – 35 in all, coming out of the South, and heading North East from my location.  Watched them glide/fly/travel through the sky for about 5 minutes and disappear completely as they turned to the North East.  Thought it was a few airplanes at first, maybe coming out of Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (CLT) however, as the first three moved towards my direction and then turned to the Northeast, I noticed many more, following closely.  Many, about 30 to 35 closely flying together.  Red/Orange in color.  Then disappearing into the night sky into nowhere.;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
