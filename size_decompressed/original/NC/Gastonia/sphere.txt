Bright Orb;1992-06-15 22:00:00;5 minutes;Bright Orb Approximately 22:00 on or about June 15th 1992, Myself and my girlfriend had just returned to her home from a dinner date. We were sitting in a 1990 Geo Storm with a hatchback. As we were talking we noticed a light inside of the vehicle, it was so bright it seemed as though the sun was out. My first thought was that a street light had come on. There were no lights near the vicinity of the vehicle. The light shinned on us for a few seconds(maybe 20-30 seconds). After the light left the car we looked out the front windshield and saw a very bright shinning orb approximately 100 feet in front of us. The orb was about 30-40 ft in the sky, just above the trees. We watched for a few seconds as the orb moved around in the sky in front of us, then it took off at an amazing speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Round metallic object flying high in sky with no sound and no vapor trial.;2004-02-01 16:30:00;30 seconds;Round metallic object flying high in sky with no sound and no vapor trial. My friend and I saw a round metallic object fly across the sky at about 4:30 PM eastern time over Gastonia, NC. It was flying high in the sky above the cloud level moving northwest at a high rate of speed. It made no sound. It had no vapor trial. It had a shiny metallic surface that reflected the sun light. It was perfectly round.;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
rustic brown sphere spotted in gastonia n.c. traveling over apartment complex.;2011-07-03 16:00:00;30 seconds;rustic brown sphere spotted in gastonia n.c. traveling over apartment complex. I walked outside to smoke a cigarette out on my third story apartment deck and was admiring the pink clouds as the sun was setting. I saw an object that was out of the ordinary. The first thing i thought of was a hot air ballon but it was too low for a landing because of all the power lines and buildings in the area. Note there was a dead wind on the ground. I would estimate the object was about 300 feet off the ground. Let me add that i have spent my whole life at airports. I am a pilot and a regular skydiver with over 600 jumps. With that said i am trained to know distances of objects and wind conditions. This was no hot air ballon because there was not a basket underneath. I would also know this because i have many ballon flights as well. The object was flying at about 35 to 40 mph. The object was orbiting in a clock wise rotation from ground view. I would say that the object was turning at 10 rpm. The color of the object was a light rustic brown. I could! tell the object was rotating because there were three indentations on the bottom half, much like a golf ball would have. The object was about 30 meters in diameter. The object maintained heading until out of site. The object was silent. This object was nothing i have ever seen and let me say that in all my years in aeronautics it baffled me. I dont know what else to say i just want answers.;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955

Orange/Reddish objects traveling at constant slow speed with no sound.;2013-02-13 19:45:00;5 minutes;Orange/Reddish objects traveling at constant slow speed with no sound. At 19:45 on 02/13/13 I noticed an Orange/Reddish object approaching from the west.  Then another and another.  About 30 in all.  Traveling at a constant slow speed in random patterns.  The glow of the objects never really changed as they approached, passed over, and departed.  They appeared below the ceiling but hard to determine actual altitude. There was absolutely no sound as they passed.   I have some good pictures and 2 short videos taken with my iPhone. I zoomed in on 2 different objects and received some interesting shots, but I can not be sure my camera was in focus while on zoom. I am sure others saw the same. Let me know if I can help.

((HOAX??))  Silver ball in lightning storm.;2014-09-03 19:30:00;5 minutes;Silver ball in lightning storm. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether this report is an attempt to hoax us.  Even though though the report appears to be carefully prepared, the witness does not provide an e-address, and the telephone number is not hisâ€¦it belongs to someone else.  We can only conclude that the report may be a hoax.  PD)) Hello,   I witnessed something last night I cannot explain.  I got home around 6:30 and decided to take a load off and chill on my deck. I wear prosthetic legs and those things really rub me raw sometimes.  So I tossed them on the bed and quickly made my way to the deck to enjoy a beverage.  I was sitting there relaxing when a storm began rolling in from the west.  I figured I had  few minutes before I had to drag myself back into the house, so I watched the clouds forming and lightning flashing in the distance, amazing stuff!    As the storm was about a mile off, I noticed a shiny object in the clouds, lit up by lightening. I thought it was a jet liner trying to get to CLT before it got diverted.  Boy was I wrong!   The more I watched the more I realized it was not a plane. It would seemingly tele-port from one area to the next in and out of the storm, and then far away. Needless to say I was stunned, and I totally lost track of the time and the storm. Within minutes the storm was right on top of my house, and so was the silver object, which I can now see was a huge ball! I watched, helplessly as it danced in and out of the clouds seemingly feeding off the lighting. I was terrified more of the object than of being struck by lighting. I've watched enough shows on cable to know what happens next.  I could feel all the hairs on my arms and stumps standing up! But I wasn't sure if it was from the object or the storm! The thing was no farther than 300 ft from the top of my house at one point! It appeared to be about 100 feet in diameter and changed colors rapidly. Unbelievable! Of course this is the one time I left the phone on the kitchen table...  That is the last thing I remember doing last night after I saw that damn thing! I woke up today a bit disoriented, and sore.  Any help or explanation from you guys would really set my mind at ease.;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
