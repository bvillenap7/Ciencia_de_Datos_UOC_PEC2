bright light - traveling upwards, then left 90 degrees, then downward 90 degrees then disappear.;2001-08-01 21:00:00;3 seconds;bright light - traveling upwards, then left 90 degrees, then downward 90 degrees then disappear. august 1, 2001 looking east from Gastonia, N.C. toward Charlotte, N.C. at 9:00 pm on a very clear, moonlight night, my wife and I were surprised to see a bright light streak up on the right side of the moon, then above the moon turn 90 degrees left, streak across the moon, then turn 90 degrees downward and disappear. It would be impossible for anything with which we are familiar to make such abrubt turns.  The viewing only lasted 3 or 4 seconds, and it was impossible to determine the distance from us nor the speed at which it was travelling.  The light was a yellow/orange color.  It was a clear night. Rather than tell my wife what I had seen, I asked her to tell me exactly what she had seen.  Her description matched my observation exactly.;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
Observed 5-6 reddish orange lights traveling acroos the sky in a formation, then they swirled around and disappeared.;2008-03-08 22:30:00;15-25 seconds;observed 5-6 reddish orange lights traveling acroos the sky in a formation, then they swirled around and disappeared was outside on back deck,..  observed lighs traveling across the sky at what would seem like the speed of a normal airplane, didnt think much of it, then realized all the lights were the same color(a reddish orange) and were not in the normal formation that an airplane lights would be in, at that time i said kind of puzzled to my brother-in-law, what kind of plane is that?..  he saw what i saw but at that moment, the lights broke formation and sort of swirled in all directions, not fast, and stayed in the same general area, meaning they didnt just go all over the sky, i ran to the back door and hollered for my sister and nephew to GET OUT HERE , NOW !!!,..  i ran back out into the yard where my b-i-l was still watching the lights, they were now patially obscurred by some tall pine trees,  then they just disappeared, no trails or anything,...  my sister and nephew never caught sight of them,..  but my b-i-l definately did...   i called and reported what i had seen to the gason county sherriffs department.;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
Saw 2 low flying objects with bright lights, no noise..;2011-06-25 22:30:00;2-3 min;Saw 2 low flying objects with bright lights ,no noise.. Around 10:30 the night of June 25, 2011, my husband and I both noticed what at first looked like 1 light as it got closer you could tell it was 2 (low enough to tell they had some sort of shape to them, but too bright causing almost a sort of shadowing so couldn't make the shape out) that were not blinking and were EXTREMELY low right around cloud level.  There were several airplanes headed toward the airport which is only 10 miles from us) and these lights appeared much lower and slower in speed and the lights were moving independently of each other at first, but continuesly circling around each other yet maintaining a straight consistent travel pattern.  As they passed over our house the lights moved even closer together and were in such synch with each other in movement.  For some reason the movement reminded me of a boomerang pattern.  (My husband doesn't agree about the boomerang thing so I guess its all in perception). I still cannot believe what we saw and it was most definitely not a plane, helicopter, balloon or shooting star.  Also, they made no noise which was odd being as low as they were.(Id say as low as youd normally see a helicopter) We called around and found no information which is odd being that the air control monitors so closely and this being so close to Charlotte Douglas Airport and being so low. Looking on google at last night's date, I was able to find many articles and pictures from other people all over the country, but so far none locally.  Someone HAD to see it.  There were several planes coming in and it was a relatively clear night..  It was just so odd. It is hard to put into words because it truly was something I have never seen.  Also the lights appeared white or soft yellow;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
UFO SIGHTING THAT MADE ME A BELIEVER & THERES MORE;2011-12-20 20:32:00;8 min;UFO SIGHTING THAT MADE ME A BELIEVER & THERES MORE First I noticed a form of stars I never recognized shaped  in the form of a capital slanted M.  I noticed not too long after that a light moving in the sky near it moving slowly from right to left but it had no flashing lights.  The course it seemed to be on didn't look as if it had any intentions on landing. I watched this object for at least a min or 2 when I went to reach for my phone.  I looked up after dialing a friend  & it disappeared.  I stared at the area to catch any sign of movement & there was nothing.  I went inside to tell a associate of mine about it then decided to go back out onto the porch to see if it returned.  I stood there for about 2-3 mins when I saw movement out the corner of my eye.  It seemed to be the same light because it was coming from the direction the first disappeared in.  The only difference this time is it gradually slowed down almost to a stop & when it picked up speed again it kind of went in a diagonal slant slowing, stopping & then going til it cloaked out near the M;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
Red pulsating light hovering in sky over Gastonia, NC.;2013-04-15 21:30:00;2 minutes;Red pulsating light hovering in sky over Gastonia, NC. I noticed a red light above the tree line to the southwest of my apartment’s patio and it caught my attention because it did not look like any aircraft beacon I have seen.  I work at a major international airport in the vicinity for airport operations on the airfield and have spent over seven years in the aviation and airport industry, so I know pretty well what an airplane or helicopter looks like flying at night.  This definitely didn’t look like either. This red light was several miles away but clearly visible.  It pulsated very slowly, I would guess 5 times slower than an aircraft’s red beacon light, but it never faded or disappeared.  At times it would get brighter and almost to an amber color then back to red.  At one point it appeared that another smaller red light appeared just slightly above the main light but soon went away.  The light hovered in the same area for about a minute and a half just slowly moving left and right ever so slightly before finally starting to pick up speed and move toward the West where I lost sight of it behind the trees. In total, the event lasted about 2 minutes.  I called my girlfriend over to the porch and she witnessed the light as well and suggested that it may be a planet or satellite, but this was not possible as there was cloud cover in the sky behind the object.;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955

A ligh;2019-07-24 23:45:00;6 seconds;Sitting out looking into the sky like I do every other night.  Rural area so your eyes catches everything the sky shows.  Clear!  A light just appeared out of nowhere like it zap in its current space then appeared to be falling.  Thought it was a rocket but now that I think about it it was fire or light behind something invisible.  The pattern of the light resembled like a object crashing but was shrinking through the skies really low.  I could see the trail of light or fire clear enough to hear a sound.  It dispersed as quick as it appeared but long enough to question it.  Sounds weird but kinda like a glitch or how people say.. a glitch in The Matrix..   I could not follow it because the light or fire dispeared.  Hard to explain but it wasn’t normal . ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
