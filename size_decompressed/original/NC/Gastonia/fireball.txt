NCCPO REPORT:  All things considered, this is an odd sighting and I cannot possibly begin to explain it.;2005-09-02 19:00:00;15-20 seconds;((NUFORC Note:  Date of the incident may be approximate, although the source from the North Carolina Cryptozoological-Paranormal Group does not indicate that fact.  We express our sincere gratitude to the source, and to NCCPO, for sharing the interesting report with NUFORC.  PD)) All things considered, this is an odd sighting and I cannot possibly begin to explain it. (This is an official report as written by NCCPO [North Carolina Cryptozoological-Paranormal Organization] lead investigator.)  The witness stated that the object sounded at first like a Terrible roaring type sound.  A moment later he witnessed what appeared to be an eighteen-wheeler traveling south in the north bound lane. He moved the car over to the side to avoid any impact with the oncoming object and several moments later a fireball that was like a burning tractor trailer roared past his vehicle.   No other reports have been verified and no formal investigation has been launched by NCCPO or any other groups.   The primary witness was a 78 year old male.  This is an odd event and NCCPO figured it would be best to record and place it in a nationwide database in case other witnesses saw the event.;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
Zig zaging fireball;2010-07-04 22:00:00;20-30 seconds;Zig zaging fireball At about 10 pm on July 4, 2010, my 12 year old son and I were standing in our front yard shooting off fireworks. I was looking at the sky facing south when my attention was drawn to a very bright reddish light low in the sky. It was about the size of a star, but it was the brightest thing in the sky. I watched if for about 2-3 seconds, before I realized it was obviously moving directly toward my position. It was getting visibly closer and appearing larger by the second. I called my son’s attention to it, and he also saw it. By this time it was not quite directly over our heads. I got a very good look at it. It appeared to be a round ball of reddish orange flame.  It definitely had the appearance of flames, but there was no visible smoke or sparks. It was completely silent and moving in a straight line, south to north.  I saw no visible structure of any type. There was no noticeable wind blowing at the time. It passed almost directly over our heads. I turned around so I could continue to watch it as it passed by me on its way north.  After watching it for a few seconds now from behind it, I saw it make a little series of zigzag movements, right, left, then right left, again.  It then continued heading off to the north in a straight line until it disappeared from my sight. It was impossible for me to accurately estimate the speed, size, or altitude, in the dark sky. If I was going to guess based on my gut feeling, I feel it was smaller (less than 3 ft. in diameter), rather than a large object and at a few hundred feet elevation, rather than higher. It was moving quickly relative to its size.  The total time I watched it was about 20-30 seconds, maybe slightly longer. There are a couple of things I am sure it wasn’t. It wasn’t a firework, like a rocket or mortar. It was totally silent, slower, and left no trail. It also did not look like any flare I have seen either. It was not smoking, sparking, leaving a trail, or appear to be dangling from a parachute.;35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955

Looked like a slow moving object, burning up on entry and had a large orange tail moving south south west.;2011-12-01 17:10:00;20 minutes;Looked like a slow moving object, burning up on entry and had a large orange tail moving south south west. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I noticed the object when I was on my way home in the passenger seat.  So I told my friend, who thought I was joking about it, I convince him that I'm not kidding and  to pull over so we can get a good look at it driving about 1/5 a mile east of where I initially saw it.  There were jets in the sky around the same time,  The trail of the object was much much shorter and fatter and the was a very bright orange which seem to engulf the front of it as if were burning, compared to the jets that were flying by.   The jets also had trails but those were skinny longer also orange due the light of the sun from the time of day, and seemed to be moving across the sky faster than this object as the object but the object was too far for me to confirm that it wasn't jet, but if it wasn't ufo related I would say that it was more likely to be some for debris or a satellite as I am sure it seem to descending or falling down from a very high altitude perhaps 2-3 miles from where we were moving south south west of vantage point.  This occurred at the time and date listed on the report 12/1/11 at about 5:10 pm est I came in as soon as I got home and looked up on the internet to see if anyone had posted anything about but found nothing related to it but searching for it did lead me to your site and I decided that I would report about it there. That's all there is Thanks ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));35.2274860649824;-81.1581864981955
Orange fiery light that flickered then disappeared.;2013-05-31 21:50:00;3-5 minutes;Orange fiery light that flickered then disappeared. My friend and I walked outside around 9:50 on May 31, 2013.  We were going to my car, and when I pulled from out of her driveway, we saw a big rounded rectangle that was a bright fiery orange.  We just jokingly said, “Look it’s a UFO!” then, as we watched it we noticed its flying pattern (south to north).  It had no blinking lights and it hovered more than it flew.  As we watched it, it started to flicker and while it was flickering, we saw three light sources.  It then disappeared.  We used logic to discount anything that was illogical. We did not have a camera on us to take a picture or video.  We proceeded to go inside and do some research.  We read many accounts that saw the same things we did.
