Three strange orange lights in the sky above Corolla, NC;2011-08-08 22:15:00;5 minutes;Three strange orange lights in the sky above Corolla, NC We were traveling south on Highway 12 near Corolla Light and we saw one round bright orange light in the sky to the left of our vehicle and it was traveling north.  We turned around, came back and then saw three orange lights in the sky, one in front and two behind it.   The strange lights then crossed above our vehicle and continued North-West towards the bay.   The lights grew smaller rapidly as they continued into the distance and then eventually disappeared.;36.3178;-75.8109
