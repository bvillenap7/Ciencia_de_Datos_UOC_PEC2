It had a series of amber, red and white lights in a circular pattern, it was about 1500 ft above our tree line, not a sound, I had my windows down in the car listeing to the radio.  It disrupted my wife's work on the PC for close to an hour. My neighbor, 1 mile up our road oberved it for 2 min.  She saw the object 3 years ago exactly on the same date.  The object seemed to flutter much like a rock skipping on water, my neighbor saw it making right angle turns, I saw it in a straight W to E line.  It was traveling at 100's of MPH.  This is as good account of what i observed, being 100% sober and drug-free. I have no idea as to what it was, being X military, it wasn't ours!;36.0254;-82.1693
