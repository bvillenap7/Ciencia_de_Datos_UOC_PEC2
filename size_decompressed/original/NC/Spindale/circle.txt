Strange reddish/orange lights over Spindale, NC  12/8/2012.;2012-12-08 19:15:00;5 minutes;Strange reddish/orange lights over Spindale, NC  12/8/2012 While driving home from working late, I noticed 5 reddish orange lights in the sky.  They were all in an arched formation and sitting still.  As I watched them, two more came up from behind the trees.  4 of the first 5 formed a different formation and the 3 remaining started moving really fast toward each other.   The 3 formed a triangle shape and them all of the went very fast straight up almost of sight and then went out over Morganton, NC before they disappeared.   This lasted about 5 minutes from the time I saw the objects and when they went straight up and out over Morganton, they were gone within 15 seconds.;35.3605;-81.9223
