Two orbs opposite each other fixed in the southern sky.;2018-08-16 19:30:00;2 hours;Two orbs opposite each other fixed in the southern sky. We were standing behind a bar at about 7:30 PM and noticed this light fixed in the sky. It never moved until two hours later when it slowly faded away (It also turned red where it had been whitish blue at the first sighting.) At first we thought,  Whatever it must be a tower or something.  Then when we came back outside so my friend could smoke we saw it still.  After being out their for 15 minutes we saw, at a directly opposite position in the sky, another light that was an orange color and was also fixed.  It was still daytime when we saw them and it was dark when they faded away.;35.3605;-81.9223
