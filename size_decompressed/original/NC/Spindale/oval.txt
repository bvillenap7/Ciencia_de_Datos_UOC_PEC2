Oval object over Forest City, NC  moving fast, then abrutly changing direction and altitude;2007-04-09 14:20:00;2 minutes;Oval object over Forest City, NC  moving fast, then abrutly changing direction and altitude At about 2:20 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, I witnessed an oval shaped object moving from south-east to north-west at a high rate of speed.  At first the object appeared to be moving in a staight line but sudenly it reversed its direction and gained significant altitude.  From the new position it would appear to bob up and down a few times then move again at a high rate of speed toward the north-west.  The sky was bright and sunny with almost no cloud cover or haze.  The oval looked to be either white or silver.  The total time that it was in view was around two minutes.  I do not think that the oval was a airplane or a helicopter as there was no noise and the aerodynamics was beyond anything that I have ever seen.;35.3605;-81.9223
