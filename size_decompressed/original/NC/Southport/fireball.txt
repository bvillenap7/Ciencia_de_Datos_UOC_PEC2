Orange fireball very fast and near at low altitude;2000-03-24 18:30:00;1-2 seconds;Orange fireball very fast and near at low altitude Sitting with my wife on front porch in Southport, NC with a limited skyward view due to large live oaks, facing southeast. My wife is on my left, as i look to my right southeast I have a brief glimpse, 1-2 seconds, of what looks like a rocket booster tail of very bright orange fire, somewhat white at the front. This fireball was headed from east to west into the setting sun, but no reflection was visible. I looked very hard at the leading edge and saw no type of craft and the fireball appeared to burn out or disappear into thin air. No sound at all. The amazing part was it traveled totally horizontal, was at approx. 45% in height, just above the tree line of neighbors house, and seemed very close, approximately 1-2 miles. Upon reflection, i wonder if this thing was taking off instead of burning out? The size and length of the firetail was the size of a cigarette, held at arms length. My neighbor has witnessed two sitings over the years, one very large and very close with lights, he's color blind, but this object was very near and just disappeared when he thought it saw him looking? The second siting flew very fast overhead, from direction of power plant and ammo dump.;33.9651857740586;-78.0362857740588

I asked my brother to turn and look and he could not believe what he was seeing. It lasted for at least 10 seconds, maybe 15 seconds. The time was 10:04 pm on 3/5/2008 (Weds night). It appeared to be a round mass with a firetail, maybe a meteor?  Have there been any other reports of anything like this near Southport NC ?  Sincerely,  Two Fisherman;33.9651857740586;-78.0362857740588

All were flying in a straight line across the horizon and all disappeared approximately in the same location in the sky.  There was no sound and was definitely not an aircraft that I'm aware of.  I was able to capture a picture of one of these objects with my camera phone.;33.9651857740586;-78.0362857740588
