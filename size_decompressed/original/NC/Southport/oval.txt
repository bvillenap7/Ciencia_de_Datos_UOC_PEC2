My husband and I were out on our back deck and saw a big Orange light above the trees in the distance in the Southern part of the sky over Long Bay.   Then it would go away and come back in a different spot in the sky.   This happen for at least 8 minutes and we kept seeing it in different spots in the sky.;33.9651857740586;-78.0362857740588
