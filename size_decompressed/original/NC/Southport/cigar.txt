Two cigar shaped objects sighted over Southport-Fort Fisher Ferry.;2006-07-22 20:00:00;2 minutes;Two cigar shaped objects sighted over Southport-Fort Fisher Ferry. A group of us were on the Southport-Fort Fisher Ferry.  At about 8:00 p.m. there appeared two cigar shaped objects overhead flying in parallel lines, one slightly behind the other, with no sound, no lights were seen, but they seemed to be very shiny, silver looking.  We watched them go out of sight into a cloud cover.  Several people on the ferry were pointing to them, and others seemed not to notice them at all.  They left no vapor trail.  They stayed exactly at the same speed and distance from each other until we could no longer see them.  The witnesses were from age 16 to 80.  I tried to take digital pictures.  If they appear on the pictures, I will send them at a later time.  I have never reported any sightings before as I have never witnessed anything that I thought to be a UFO before, but these objects were strange.;33.9651857740586;-78.0362857740588
