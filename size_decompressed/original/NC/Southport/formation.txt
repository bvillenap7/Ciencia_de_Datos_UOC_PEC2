They came and went for about 2 hours or so.  They changed locations and formations as well.  They started out in random pulses and then went to a triangular form soon after.   Then my friend mentioned a light he saw that was straight up and noticed some distant lights shooting across the sky.  We saw them dodging what seemed like pulses of light.  Almost like a high powered laser being shot at them.  They weren't coming from the ground though.   Sounds crazy but this really happened.  All this was seen without night vision goggles.   These lights are viewed regularly from the Southport/Oak Island area.  Most likely due to the location of Sunny Point basically right down the road.
