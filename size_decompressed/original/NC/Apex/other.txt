Three silver balls forming a triangle shape;2008-09-20 10:30:00;mins;Three silver balls forming a triangle shape I was visiting a relative in NC. On 9/20/08 at approximately 10:30pm I was sitting on a back porch by myself. It was  a very clear night with good visibility. I was watching plans that were off in the distance, the airport is about 30 miles from the house.. Most of the planes  were coming from the North then heading East. Then from behind a large tree to the North I saw what looked like 3 balloons tied together forming a triangle shape. They were not lit up , more like illuminating from the lights below and the moon. The object looked silver and moved very slow with no sound. Then it moved very fast covering a large distance, then slowed down again and then went backwards a ways. At this point I called for my dad and aunt to come see. I realized it was not balloons. This was far to big to be. The object kind of hovered in the same spot for a few seconds, looking  like a ball would look floating on water. Then it made a fast movement to the South West, then turned West and what looked like straight up, then it was gone. About 2 minuets later two military jets flew by. They both went to the East. Finally my family came out and watched the sky with me for a while. All we saw after that were  commercial airplanes.  I have had several sightings all in Arizona. This was unlike the other two objects I have seen.;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003
unexplainable air craft;2010-12-30 23:00:00;10 min;unexplainable air craft My boyfriend and I were laying in bed.  His window is right by is bed to we were looking out of it.  I noticed something that looked like a really bright star.  It started slowly moving towards us. We ran outside to watch it.  The closer that it got we noticed it had lights coming from all sides. Very bright lights.  It started going straight up in the air very slowly. we stared at it until it just became a star.  It never went farther away or came any closer after that.  It was just the brightest star in the sky. we went back in side and were talking about what we just saw.  Moments later i spotted another one. A bigger one with more lights than the first one.  It was moving so slow but came so low we knew it was not an air plane or anything else.  It had a soft humming noise as well.  We ran out side again and for something that was moving so slow by the time we ran out thereIt was gone.  We have been trying to talk our selves out of what we saw for the past week.  It w! as the weirdest thing we have had happen to us.;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003
My father, sister, and I witness an octagonal UFO along N Salem St starting at the intersection at US 64 (19:30 EST).;2019-10-10 19:30:00;10 minutes;My father, sister, and I witness an octagonal UFO along N Salem St starting at the intersection at US 64 (19:30 EST). It was around 19:30 EST when me, my father, and my younger sister witnessed a UFO on the US 64 and N Salem Street intersection in Apex North Carolina in our car as we were driving downtown. The craft was around 75ft to 100ft above us and that's when we had the clearest view. Identification of the craft physical color was not able to be witnessed due to low visibility due to it being dark out. However, the craft was in the shape a flat octagonal prism. We new this because of the red and green lights visible at each of the eight corners of the craft. As we observed the craft was turning counterclockwise as it slowly moved east from our original location. As we were going down Salem St, the craft could still be seen but only its lights and its shaped cannot be distinguished at that point beyond the trees.;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003
