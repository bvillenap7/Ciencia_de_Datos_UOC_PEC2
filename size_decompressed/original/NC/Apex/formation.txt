Coming in around 9 pm one night in November [not sure of exact date] I noticed 3 planets lined up high in the eastern sky. There was no moon and few stars that I could see. I came inside to get my camera [a simple Kodak CX4200] and snapped a picture of them.  [I remember having to hold the camera high to get the shot]. I didn't get a good shot, as the 3 lights were very faint in the photo so I saved it in my files to check out later. [Planets line up all the time]. I found this picture the other day when cleaning out my files, cropped it some, and used my brighten/contrast feature from the camera software to bring out the 3 lights, deleting the original almost black photo. The 3 horizontal lights at the bottom now looked bright red, and then there were horizontal Ys that seemed to be linked by the tails, and 4 red lights at the top right side of the formation lined up at an angle that I didn't see that night. Also, on the right inside light there seems to be a red dot next to it. [I don't think we can photograph moons of distant planets with cheap digital cameras!].  Just an interesting shot, though, and wish I'd gone back out later to check on it but didn't think it was anything spectacular. Maybe my software changed the colors unjustly but there's no doubting the odd formation, even in a legitmate constellation. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The constellation, Orion, whose Belt appears to be three stars in a row, is in the eastern sky, at present.  We suspect the witness means a date in 2003, but we will check.
