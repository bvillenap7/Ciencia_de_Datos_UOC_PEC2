Early morning, house filled with light, and there it was above me...;2001-05-25 02:00:00;less than 30 seconds;Early morning, house filled with light, and there it was above me... I was in 5th grade. It was very early in the morning. We were sleeping on the 1st floor of our townhouse and all of a sudden, the entire house filled with light. I opened the back door and looked up. I saw a huge, circular craft floating above me. It floated without a sound. Then it was gone. It didn't even have to move. It just dissapeared. I turned around and my mom was there, so i have one other witness. We don't talk about that day much. No one else believes us. I felt it was my duty to report this. Thank you.

MANY WITNESSES Today October 10, 2019, at around 7:30 PM me and my family witnessed a huge craft in the sky, at first it was silver and was flashing lights then we tried to follow it but it disappeared. Then 5 minutes later we saw it again and this time it changed to bright red lights and we started recording.  I told people about it and my friend sent me a video and told me that many people at a school football game also saw it, in the video it was bright red and silver and it seemed to be really close.
