It was moving fast at a 45 degree angle then suddenly shot straight down then disappeared. If not for the sudden turn downward I would have dismissed this as a reflection from an airplane it took my breath because I thought something would hit the ground at any second. I didn't hear anything. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed quite sincere and credible to us.  PD));35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003
Low flying, fast moving, light disappears into thin air.;2014-02-07 21:00:00;30 seconds;Low flying, fast moving, light disappears into thin air. While having a cigarette on my back porch I just happened to look up and I saw a white light with a very slight light green tint.  It seemed to be very low and was completely silent as moved swiftly towards the north and east.   I watched just for a few moments before the light disappeared before my eyes.;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003
Bright green light sparking in sky near Lake Jordan.;2016-06-10 22:00:00;3 seconds;Bright green light sparking in sky near Lake Jordan While driving east on rt 64 from Apex towards Raleigh, a bright green light flew over the road from the south.    My first thought was that it was a plane preparing for landing at RDU but it was low enough to observe that there was nothing else attached to the light.   As it flew silently over the rd it began to spark from the bottom.   The Sparks fell from the object as it disappeared over the trees on the other side of the rd.   This all happened as I was approaching lake Jordan from the direction of Pittsboro. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous provides little contact information.

Jordan Lake ufo light;2020-08-08 23:30:00;1-2 minutes;Jordan Lake ufo light I had traveled cross country from California to North Carolina, on August 8 between 11:30 and midnight I saw the UFO.  We had stopped at Crosswind campgrounds for the night, I had been in the RV for quite some time so I took a walk alone to stretch out.  Our campsite was B73 I walked about 3-5 minutes to the lakeside and looked at the water and admired how still it was.  From roughly about a mile away from under the bridge I saw a white light with a red center it began coming in my direction extremely fast.  It went behind a group of trees and powered down.  I own jet skis and no jet ski moves that fast and didnâ€™t disturb the water.;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003
