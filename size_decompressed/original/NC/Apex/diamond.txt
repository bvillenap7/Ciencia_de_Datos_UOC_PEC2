On November 8, 2018, at approximately 7:30pm, we were walking our dogs down our street and saw a very large (larger than our house), squished-diamond shaped, black aircraft, with red and green non-flashing lights, moving extremely slowly from left to right.  It was just over the tree tops, but lower than the top of the radio tower, that was to its left.   It slowed almost to a stop and turned to its left and went below the tree line.  There was no obvious aircraft engine noise, but had a low hum to it.  I was waiting to hear a crash and an explosion, but it never happened.   My friend, who is a pilot, was with me.  He said he had never seen anything like it.  Our neighbor said she also saw it, but did not know what it was.  What was remarkable was how large, quiet and slow moving it was.;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003
