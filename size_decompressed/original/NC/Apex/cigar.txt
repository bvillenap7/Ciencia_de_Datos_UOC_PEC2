Two white cylindrical objects sighted above Apex NC;2019-10-25 08:28:00;1 minute;Two white cylindrical objects sighted above Apex NC Two white cigar-shaped or cylindrical objects sighted moving at a constant speed, bearing almost due north.  One object was further ahead of the second one, in other words it was further north, and the second object was south west of the first object.  They both appeared to be moving at the same speed.  The size and altitude was not clear, but I would estimate probably 6000 ft or so, because they moved behind or through the low cumulus clouds. They appeared to be the size of a small propeller plane, possibly larger due to perspective. No sound was audible from the objects, and there were no visible contrails or exhaust coming from the objects. The objects appeared to be white, perfect cylinders with a pinch in the middle, somewhat similar to the appearance of a single chromatid in a chromosome pair. I did see a glint sunlight reflected so they seem to be reflective. I did not see any lights blinking, flashing or anything other lights on the objects ! or emanating from the objects. Both objects moved north at a constant speed and did not have any erratic movements. The objects were visible for maybe 30-60 seconds as they glided silently before moving out of sight behind the tree line.;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003

Object moved slowly across the road and over some trees out of our line of sight.  Object was NOT an aircraft fixed wing or rotor.  Made no noticeable noise, and all 4 people in the car yelled, “What is that!!??” at the same time.  One witness is an aviation enthusiast, and another a med flight nurse with 28 years in rotor and fixed wing aircraft.;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003
