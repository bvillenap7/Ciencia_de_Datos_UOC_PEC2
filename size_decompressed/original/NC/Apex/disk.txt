Blue lights from a spinning UFO that glided across the sky.;2014-07-27 03:00:00;30 seconds;Blue lights from a spinning UFO that glided across the sky. From Greensboro I was driving to Raleigh to meet a friend.  It was my first time driving this route.  At one point I found myself looking way up above me whilst on a narrow road surrounded by trees on both sides of me.  There were these blue lights gliding across the sky.  I was unable to stop because there was another car behind me.  It appeared that the lights came from a hovering craft that spun - causing the lights to look like they were blinking.  It was such a spectacular blue.  A glowing blue.  Because I could not take my eyes off the road just to completely stare at it..  from a distance when I looked up next it had disappeared curving west and into the lefthand side of the trees.;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003
