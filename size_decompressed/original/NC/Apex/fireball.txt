Two orange-ish fireballs travelling horizontally in succession with some sparks coming out of them;2014-07-17 21:15:00;~6 minutes;Two orange-ish fireballs travelling horizontally in succession with some sparks coming out of them.  I have a cathedral ceiling in the living room with double windows high up on the wall. I was just sitting on the couch and looked up and saw an orange-red-white fireball passing somewhat slowly by, through the double windows. It was large.  It was dark out, so it was hard to tell which direction it was travelling.  No noise, no trail left behind.  It appeared to be going away from me at a diagonal direction I had to get up and stand back in the room to watch where it was going. After a short time (a minute??) I noticed things that looked like sparks come down only from the bottom of the fireball.  At that point I thought it was likely some type of firework or flare.  It appeared to disappear behind some trees behind a main road near my house where there is a wooded area. In a few minutes, another similar thing came by and did the exact same trajectory, disappearing behind the trees.  I am thinking it's a firework (??). It was travelling fairly slowly though, and generally in a horizontal direction, as if being steered...I think a firework would go straight up vertically (?).;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003
