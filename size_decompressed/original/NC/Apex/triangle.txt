Shaped like quarter-piece of pie/triangular. 45 degrees above horizon. Hovering w/blinking lights on opposite corners & vivid red and blue lights underneath. Object low & small or High & Gigantic. Could not ascertain. ::POOF!:: it disappeared. 4 miles from Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant. Town of Fuquay had power blackout(2Hr.duration)@ approx.10PM-06/22/98. Father injured himself in dark. Drove him to hospital in Cary. Driving home south on Hwy 55, saw BRIGHT white light-southern horizon. Shaped liked & as luminous as: 1 piece of full moon divided into quarter pieces. Father commented:Didn't know they'd built a new radio tower there. I replied: NOT a tower light. No tower. Object/light 45 degrees above horizon. Driving south, it was hovering towards north. Our positions met. Looking at it up thru windshield, looked pie-piece/triangular shaped. White bright still in front w/blinking lights on opposite corners. When directly overhead, saw vivid red and blue lights underneath. Effect was, either it was small object descended & immediately overhead- OR GIGANTIC OBJECT that never descended as we met going in opposite directions. Hard to tell. Car behind tailgating me- I couldn't stop. Went 3 hundred yards turned off and turned around to look and ::POOF!:: It, whatever it was, was gone. Had a good 360 degree view of horizon. This location was 4 miles from Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant. It behaved like nothing I've seen in my 46 yrs. or my father's 76 yrs. Strange, indeed. Any other reports about this one??;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003
A very large triangular aray of (3) lights seen in the east and moving rapidly north north-west.;1999-08-12 03:58:00;1aprox 15 seconds;A very large triangular aray of (3) lights seen in the east and moving rapidly north north-west. A friend an I were watching the sky for the perceids meteor shower. We were just south of Raleigh, NC. There was a good deal of light pollution but the sky was clear. We were facing east and watching high in the east sky. I noticed an orange light in the sky that at first I thought was an aircraft, but it would have had to be extremely high (I could not distinguish the red/green sides and there was no strobe).  There was also no sound. It struck me that the light was moving very fast for such a height. I made a comment about it. My friend looked and was shocked. She saw a very large triangle. When she stated she saw the triangle I shifted my field of view that had been concentrating on the one point I spotted and realized there were 3 greatly separate points in a triangular shape all moving together and at what seemed to be a very great speed if the lights were as distant as they seemed to be. We both watched the triangle move to the north north-west. I tried to see if it obstructed any stars as it moved, but the light pollution was too great and the visible stars too few, I did not see it pass in front of any visible star until I lost sight of it in the light pollution to the North. The total sighting could not have been more than 15 seconds, more likely it was 10 or less. The triangle shape was irregular, certainly not equilateral. To judge it's size I compared it to Jupiter and Saturn, which were both visible at this time in the east sky. The longest side of the triangle was about 6/10 to 7/10 the distance between Jupiter and Saturn. The next side was about 4/5 the size of the longest side, while the shortest side was perhaps 1/2 the size of the longest side. It did not move with one of the points in the lead, rather it seemed to sweep across the sky with the shortest side of the triangle in the lead. The corner points did seem rigidly fixed, they did not move relative to each other at all during the observation. My friend and I are both unsure if this was one very large object or simply three lights flying in this pattern. She (very much a UFO skeptic) believes it was one object without having seen it obstruct a star I'm unsure and more inclined to think it was 3 objects. We both agree that it moved across the sky too quickly to be aircraft at the height that aircraft would have had to be at to look like this (several miles). By itself I expect this report to be pretty unspectacular.  I'm submitting it only because I realize that there may have been other sky watchers at or around the time who also saw it and may have been able to make a better observation. I hope that this report can help back up such an observation. I am not e-mailing any additional information at this time, but would be glad to do so if such were requested. I also do not check the request for a contact or collect call boxes. However, if there are other reports that this report can help collaborate, please contact me via e-mail and I will be glad to provide any information requested. And, of course, if you somehow know what we saw, please let me know.;35.7177999999989;-78.842800000003

As I approached I realized it wasn't moving.  I then thought it was a cell tower lights, I got right beside the object and stopped.  I could clearly see it, it was approximatly 300 yards to the left and above me.  As my vehicle came to a stop, I rolled the window down and one more person slowed their vehicle beside me and stared as well.  The object began to move with a low huming sound.

I saw one light off in the distance comeing towards me and then i saw three lights in a triangle formation.  i could not see anything but the 3 lights, but it flew right over me, and it was sort of a droaning sound, it didnt sound like a helicopter, and seemed to be going to slow to be an airplane.

Spotted: a triangular shaped object hovering slight above treeline level at the border of Apex and Cary.;2008-10-30 06:50:00;5 Minutes;Spotted: a triangular shaped object hovering slight above treeline level at the border of Apex and Cary. A friend and I were on our way to school when we approached a stoplight. I noticed two bright lights on what appeared to be a very large, low-flying plane that, based upon the light positions, seemed to be making such a turn that its wings were vertical. In specific terms, I would estimate that the object was no higher than two hundred yards above the ground. However, as we turned right from the stoplight, and I was able to get a better view of the object, I noticed that it had not been turning, and that the effect of vertical wings had actually derived from the positioning of two of the lights with one closer to me than the other. As I looked attempted to observe the object better, which was difficult considering how dark it was, I noticed a third light, completing a triangular shape. At this point I exclaimed to my friend, who was driving the car, about the object. He took a very quick glance, and assumed that it may have been a bomber plane. As unlikely as that would have been, what completely ruled out that possibility was that fact that the object had not moved throughout the two minutes that I had seen it at this point. So we continue to drive, while I am watching the object, waiting for it to move and at the very least do away with certainty that it was a non-human object (I knew as a fact it was not a helicopter). However, as we approached yet another stoplight between a mile-and-a-half and two miles from the first stoplight, my friend decided that he would have a look at the object himself. He took a quick glance back, and said something to me, at which moment I took my sight away from the object to respond to him. We had a very brief transaction of words, and upon looking back at where the object was we found it no longer visible. The area that the object was over was that of a neighborhood, which was bordered on one side by a construction zone. At first I thought that maybe the lights were from a crane or construction lights from the frame of a multiple-story building that was being worked upon during the early hours. However, returning home that evening I noticed that not only were there no cranes, but the building that was being built only had about five floors. Large cranes for such a small building would be unnecessary, and the building itself was not tall. At least, not tall enough to match the height of the object I saw in the sky.
