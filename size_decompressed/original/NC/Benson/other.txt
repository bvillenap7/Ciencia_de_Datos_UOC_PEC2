very bright star object;2008-09-14 06:10:00;4 mins;very bright star object while riding around our plant in a golf cart i happened to notice what i thought was a very bright star moving toward me from the west.then i thought maybe it was a satllite,but this object was much brighter and more like a very bright star.also when it appeared overhead it turned toward the southeast and kept a steady rate of speed.satellites usually keep a straight orbit around the earth but this oject turned .i watched it until it disappeard on the eastern horizon.this oject had no blinking lights or any other visible signs only the fact it was vey bright and looked like a very bright star.;35.4055;-78.5438000000001
