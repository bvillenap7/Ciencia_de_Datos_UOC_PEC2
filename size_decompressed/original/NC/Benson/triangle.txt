It was dark gray colored, and the best that I could tell, was triangle-shaped. It was at the most 5000 to 7500 feet high. It moved faster than anything I’ve ever seen. It flew at an angle and was only visible for a second. I just can’t imagine that a US stealth plane (SR-71) would be in this area.;35.4055;-78.5438000000001
