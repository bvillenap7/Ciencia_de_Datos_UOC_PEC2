We went to explore further while vacationing here on the Oceanside and it appears pretty popular this whole week of people setting off the Chinese lanterns.  We got excited as we have seen unexplained things in the past but getting a better view those lanterns even photograph like some of those red streak photos you have.  Thought I'd help. I've seen a UFO out here in the past but thought I'd give more insight on the fireballs these ones seeming to be Chinese lanterns.  Thanks!  Didn't know where else to send this to you other than a report.;35.5645;-75.471
