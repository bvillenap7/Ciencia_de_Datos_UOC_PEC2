My life will always be different!!;2015-07-03 02:00:00;Not sure;My life will always be different!! It was the night of July 3rd, 2015.  My girlfriend and I where winding down from a long afternoon of having people stop by.   It was about 2 am, when I decided to go grab something to eat from the local McDonald's where I live.  So I headed out.  On my way back in, getting closer to my house there is a side road I can turn on, and that takes me to my house (short cut).  I have driven this road almost everyday.  Apparently on this night I was in for awakening.   As I turned left on this road, I continued driving right until I got to the bottom of the curve.  There are two cow fields on both sides of this road.  While driving I seen a cloak or mirage of color's in the sky.  Never seen anything like this before.   So I stopped my car and got out to observe what I was seeing.  My first thought was, maybe someone is shooting fireworks.  (Then I thought about it.  It's the night before the 4th of July who would do that).  Also, there was not a sound.   As I continued looking at the ! merge of colors the whole time all of these colors where moving in the sky side by side. It was moving east to west.  As it got closer to where I was standing in the road, I got closer to my car.  Feeling uneasy on what it was.   All of a sudden, a light cut on in the pitched black sky made three movements like it was looking for something and cut off.  After the light cut off in the sky you could see the cloak again continue to move west.  I watched it until it completely vanished in the sky.   I rushed home.  My girlfriend immediately knew something was wrong, when I came in by my body language.  My hair was standing up on my arms, and face.  I did not want to tell her but I did.  Its only been a year, but I remember every day what I seen!!!!!;35.8641;-81.0684
