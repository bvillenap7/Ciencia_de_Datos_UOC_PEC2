White object with bluish blinking lights see in Rougemont NC;2020-08-12 05:55:00;15 seconds;White object with bluish blinking lights see in Rougemont NC I saw a large round white light with 3 small bluish white blinking lights on 3 sides. Moving low and semi slow. Moving east to west.  Was driving so I watched until it went out of sight.  From the way the li ghts appeared it must have been a triangular object but canâ€™t be sure.  It was definitely not an airplane.;36.2395;-78.9017
