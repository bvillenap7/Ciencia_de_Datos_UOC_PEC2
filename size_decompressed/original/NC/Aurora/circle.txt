4 bright orange circles in the sky with a small trail of smoke above each one.;2012-12-19 19:48:00;~10 minutes;4 bright orange circles in the sky with a small trail of smoke above each one. I was driving down the road in the town of Aurora, North Carolina.  Low in the sky I saw at first 2 very bright orange balls.  They seeded almost like they were attached in some way. I thought at first of headlights on a low airplane.  After getting into an area that had less trees I saw 4 orange balls.  The other 2 were close to each other like the first looking almost connected.  All 4 of them each had a faint short trail of what looked like smoke on the top of them. I called my parents that live a few miles up the road from where I was at, and they saw them as well.  As I was traveling up the road toward the lights, a car in front of me pulled over to the side and parked, (this was on a back road with no houses or driveways in sight).  I proceeded to my parents house and  picked them up and we drove a little further up the road to a place that was a bit clearer.  Each one of the balls slowly fizzed out one bye one.  The just slowly got dimmer until you couldn't see them any more.  There was not any sound that we could hear from them, and the entire occurrence lasted for about 10 minutes total. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be objective and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a quite reliable witness.  PD));35.306;-76.802
