((anonymous report));2019-07-22 04:00:00;1 minutes;While crossing the Pamlico River on a tugboat northbound in the ICW I saw 3 white lights in the shape of a triangle in the sky.  It also had a pinkish light in the middle.  I observed it for about a minute before it just disappeared.  It wasnâ€™t very high off the water, maybe a couple hundred feet.
