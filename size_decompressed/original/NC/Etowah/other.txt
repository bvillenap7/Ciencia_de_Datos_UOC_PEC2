On the evening mentioned, I went outside to sit on the deck around 9:35 PM. I noticed a bright, rather large light that seemed to be of a golden color on the horizon to the West. I initially thought it was a plane landing at the Asheville Airport but noticed that it was not moving that quickly. Then, thought aha! planet. But, no. That was when I called my husband outside who quickly got his little binoculars that are not too strong (4X) but sufficed. We both watched this object which looked like an upside down rimless cereal bowl. It was surrounded by lights which gave us the shape. The lights seemed to emit a reddish color and a few of them were larger around the bottom. Rather like searchlights. We watched for about 15 minutes and it just seemed to disappear. The craft was hovering and moving slowly and it was almost difficult to get a point of reference regarding the speed that it traveled. Needless to say, we were puzzled and did not know who to call. It needed to be reported and as we do not think that it was an helicopter or a plane I dedcided to go to the net. Appreciate any input. As to ourselves we are born skeptics and need proof of existence before we believe. My husband is a chemical engineer with that type of logic and I share the same characteristics.;35.3141;-82.5968
