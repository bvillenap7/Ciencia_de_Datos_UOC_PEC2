UNKOWN BRIGHT LIGHT-1973 NORTH CAROLINA;1973-06-01 19:30:00;1/2 HOUR;UNKOWN BRIGHT LIGHT-1973 NORTH CAROLINA ON OR ABOUT THE EVENING IN THE YEAR 1973(DURING THE PASSING OF THE COMET KAHOTECK NEAR EARTH) MY SISTER CALLED ME FROM MY BEDROOM YELLING UFO, UFO!!. I WENT OUTSIDE AND TO THE SSW WE (THAT IS MYSELF, SISTER AND OUR MOTHER) SAW A BRIGHT LIGHT, AS BRIGHT AS AN WELDERS ARC. THE LIGHT ASCENDED AND DESCENED SERVERAL TIMES BEHIND A GROUP OF TREES AND EVERY MINUTE OR SO WOULD BECOME BRIGHTER OR DIMMER. THERE WAS NO NOISE WHAT SO EVER AND AFTER 1/2 HOUR IT DESECNDED BEHIND THE TREES AND WE NEVER SAW IT AGAIN. SCENCE THERE WAS STILL ENOUGHT LIGHT TO SEE BY I OBSERVED IT CLOSELY AND CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS NO AIRCRAFT OF ANY KIND NOR A FLARE, HELICOPTER, OR ANY OTHER KNOWN OBJECT WE COULD IDENTIFY, IT WAS NOT THE COMET SINCE COMET DON'T MOVE IN A VERTICAL LINE, SO TO THIS DAY I CLASSIFY IT AS A U.F.O. TO THIS DAY I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.5458;-80.6166
