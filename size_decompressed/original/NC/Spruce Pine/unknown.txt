It sounded like a loud wall of wind that caused the previous rain/dew droplets from a shower at 11:30 pm to fall in a line across our tent from left to right.  This happened probably 12 times in a row and abruptly ended.  The following night the wind blew and sounded like regular old wind and not the line of wind heard beginning faintly on one side of the mountain area getting extremely and disturbingly loud as it passed over us, getting fainter as it disappeared on the opposite side.  The tent never moved even though one would think that it would with trees only 25 feet or so above us dropping droplets of water from the leaves.  Camped many times over 30 years in the mountains and never have heard something so strange as to wake us from our sleep like that!;35.906;-82.0693000000001
