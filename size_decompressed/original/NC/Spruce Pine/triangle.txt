Red and Yellow Prisms in the Sky over Appalachia;2010-11-10 21:00:00;1 hour;Red and Yellow Prisms in the Sky over Appalachia I went with a friend of mine to his brother's house.  It had a spectacular view of the Appalachian Mountains facing Marion, NC from near Henredon Road in Spruce Pine.  While we were eating dinner, my friend asked his brother if he'd seen the UFOs lately.  I laughed, because I thought UFOs were stupid.  But his brother said not to laugh, that he had seen then EVERY NIGHT for TWO YEARS.  Sometimes, he said, the lights were so bright that his living room lit up.  I thought the man was insane.  But when it got dark, we went out on his porch with a $2,000 telescope.  For the first hour, we didn't see anything.  I was about to give up, when I saw a red dot appear over the mountain far in the distance.  It was probably a few miles away.  I looked closer, and saw it was too stable to be a jet or plane.  But it moved too much to be a tower.  Soon, another appeared.  In a time span of about 15 minutes, a total of 7 appeared.  They hovered together, and I looked throug! h the telescope at them.  They looked like prisms, flashing red and yellow.  Even through the telescope, they still looked very small, but much closer than the stars.  They changed colors about every second, but it was a gradual change, not a bright flash.  They were primarily red and yellow.  Then the scariest thing happened.  They formed a circle, and started spinning together counter clockwise.  Soon after that, they vanished, one by one.  I think the most interesting thing is that these can be seen every night.  I've since moved away, but I would love to know if these are a government project, an optical illusion, or real UFOs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
