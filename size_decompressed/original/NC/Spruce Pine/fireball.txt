large neon green ball with greenand white tail shooting across sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2007-02-21 21:17:00;3-5 min.;large neon green ball with greenand white tail shooting across sky I was lying in bed talking with my boyfriend when I happened to glance outside.  When I looked outside I suddenly saw a very large neon green ball shooting across the sky.  It looked outside I suddenly saw a very large neon green ball shooting across the sky.  It had an extended green and white tail.  It was much larger than any meteor I have ever seen and seemed to be about or below cloud level.  It was awesome!!!  I immediately yelled at my boyfriend look, look! but by the time he turned around it was gone, so it only lasted about  3-5 seconds.  The window looks out to the north and the object went across the sky from approximately west to east. I am guessing this was a similar object to the sightings that were reported back on January 24th.  I am an avid sky watcher and make a point of sky watching during any major predicted event such as meteor showers etc.  This was unlike anything I have seen before.;35.906;-82.0693000000001
