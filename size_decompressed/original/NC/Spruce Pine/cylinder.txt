Fast, silent, low flying cylinder in Blue Ridge Mtns of North Carolina;2009-12-11 18:00:00;30 seconds;Fast, silent, low flying cylinder in Blue Ridge Mtns of North Carolina Date, time and place of sighting: On Friday evening, December 11th, 6:00pm, while driving northeast on US Highway 19E from Burnsville to Spruce Pine, NC.  Near Spruce Pine, an object flew over my vehicle traveling in almost the same direction as I was driving, so I noticed it when it was almost directly overhead.  It was traveling in a little more easterly direction than I was. Appearance: It had the appearance of a “stick” shape, without wings.  It had a single small, white light in the front and  a bigger white light in the rear.  It was flying very low and extremely fast.  I did not hear any noise associated with it at all.  I was traveling with other traffic and with my windows closed and heater on., but I still would have expected to hear a roar from something traveling so close overhead. I assume the occupants of the other vehicles near me also sighted it, but the only other witness I know was my 9-year-old son who was traveling with me.
