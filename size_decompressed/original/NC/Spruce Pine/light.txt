The craft was moving faster than I have ever seen anything move in my entire life.;2005-03-25 10:11:00;5 mins;The craft was moving faster than I have ever seen anything move in my entire life. My mother and I were travelling down the road when we both noticed a small ball of orange light appear in the sky.  At first we thought it was an airplane, but when it began moving at a extremely high rate of speed, we knew it was not.  It travelled horizontally in the sky faster than I have even seen anything move, for a distance at would have taken a normal craft such as a plane 3-4 minutes.  It then disappeared.  It reappeared in the sky several miles to the left of where it had disappared, and continued along to the left, as before, at a high rate of speed.  It once again disappeared, and at this point my mother and I knew this was nothing either of us had ever seen.  Once it re-appeared in the sky, again, several miles to the left again, it was stationary.  It started to mave again on its previous course, to the left, when it started to move diagonally across the sky faster than before, again, faster than I have ever seen anything move before.  Me and my mother both knew at this time that this was not normal.  It continued along this path for about one minute, moving very fast until it disappeared again and never re-appeared.;35.906;-82.0693000000001
