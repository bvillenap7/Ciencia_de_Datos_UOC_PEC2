Fiery reddish oval made from strings of light hovering.;2012-05-04 00:38:00;2 minutes;Fiery reddish oval made from strings of light hovering. I was coming down Main Street in Jamestown, NC, heading east toward Greensboro, NC.  The time was between 12:35am and 12:40am, I know this because I had just clocked out from work, I had just turned onto main street, when I noticed a reddish orange fiery light in the top center of my windshield.  I couldn’t shake the annoying light and started to stare at it to figure out where it was coming from.  At some point driving down the road, I could view the object out the drivers’ window, it was in the dark sky and had reddish orange strings of light bowing at the top and bottom forming an oval shape.  At one point of viewing it, I could see that the oval of light had a then sliver of darkness in the middle separating the top and bottom of the oval light.  I was so intrigued I pulled off and stopped in parking lot to observe the flying object. At first, the object seemed to be hovering close enough to see well.  After a minute or two it slowly faded away, getting smaller and smaller. I got back in my car and started driving home. Then thought to myself, I just saw my first, real UFO!   After this realization, I had a little brain strain in the left side of my head.  It went away though.   Then I called friends to tell them of the event.;36.0011;-79.9261999999999
