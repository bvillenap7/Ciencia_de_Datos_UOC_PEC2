Never saw anything like this flyng thing.;2019-01-26 23:59:00;~2 minutes;Never saw anything like this flyng thing. At around midnight Jan 26, 2019 my dogs started baking and running to windows, they do this when car comes up my road, I live near shiny rock wilderness seclude and along.  I opened back door, went out on back deck, of my house.  Didn't see anything, so walked back to door , was going look on other side of house,up the mountain.  But saw lights green and white metal object moving into view about 50 ft away, 15 to 20 hovering slow above the pavement, straight forward flying slow, first I thought it maybe helicopter but no sound except the wind it was cold windy last night.it was dark and object seam to be as big as truck, but not tell it shape, looking through the trees.  No way possible helicopter could fly that close to trees and power wires that low, not possible.  It hovered there maybe 30 seconds 50 ft from me.   I started feeling kinda weak and dissy, like going off the deck.then it hovered down the above the road and pick up speed not fast flew back house ma! ybe 500 yrds stoped hovered again for 30 to 45 seconds moving slow.  Then shot to top of mountain, half mile super fast , gone 1 second.  It looked round with green and white lights.  As seen flying up at that angle.  Let my Dogs out, they run barking in the. road were it hovering in the back looking uproad;35.5116;-82.8365999999999
