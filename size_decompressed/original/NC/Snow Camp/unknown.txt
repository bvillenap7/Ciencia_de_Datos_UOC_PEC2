My girlfriend and I were sitting on the back porch at 10:25 P.M. on Nov. 19, 2015, and I looked up to the east of the sky and seen a bright light.  I got my girlfriend to look at it, we watched it for about one and a half minutes, then noticed that it had a bright light and two flashing lights to what we could see.  The two flashing lights were green and red. 	As we sat and watched it, it was moving straight up but side to side at the same time. It seemed to be getting farther away the longer we watched.  I had turned away for about 10 to 20 seconds and by the time I had turned back around we noticed that the lights were gone and nowhere to be seen in the sky to our view.;35.9088;-79.4272
