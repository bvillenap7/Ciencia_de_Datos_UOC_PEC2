I took my dog out after I got home at 22:30 pm.  I looked up and a saw 3 red lights moving at a consistent speed.  It seemed faster than a normal passenger airplane, but slow enough to where I could capture a photo of the object.  It made no sound.  There were 3 lights were in row, kind of saucer shaped, the middle light was slightly higher and it circled my house once.  They were all red lights, except  for the light in front would blink.  It was pretty big, probably atleast the size of a football field in the sky.  Soon after my fianc√© came home and saw the lights as well.  He couldn't explain it.  He initially thought military.  Then after it circled my house, another 2 Red lights appeared to come from behind the trees and travelled under the larger object.  This object seemed really long as there were only 2 lights, it seemed just a bit smaller than the larger object with the 3 red lights.  Afterwards the object with the 2 red lights travelled under the bigger one! and they travelled behind my house and then disappeared behind the trees.  This whole time my dog seemed confused and more excited than normal.;35.9088;-79.4272
