Huge combination of shapes, lit up with individual white, bright light;2007-01-26 04:10:00;1 minute;Huge combination of shapes, lit up with individual white, bright light About 4:10 am I had gone outside with my black lab to use the bathroom.  I have a deep back yard with lots of trees.  As I was standing at the foot of my deck, I saw what I first thought was a very large, oversized plane with every light that they had on it and in it turned on.  I saw it come over the tree tops at the very back of the lot and it slowly kept coming, passed to the side of my house and then I did not see it.....they were not a streak of light, no color, it just looked like a pallet full of light, though not square...not oblong not round but a combination of these shapes.   Still believing it was a plane, I tried to see the red/green/blinking lights on a wing but I DID NOT see a wing and I saw no color.  The ligts were more individual than a blur.... While dressing for work around 6:30 am I saw on CNN news about sitings from the evening before, around 8:00 PM.  They were talking about blue, yellow white, lights flashes, etc.  What I saw was very large and ver lit up.  It moved slowly, not as fast as an airplane...I did not see anything hanging down nor did it make erratic movements....it was just there.  I said, out loud, Gosh, that looks like a floating city in the sky not because of buildings or shape but because it was large and lit up. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This is the same report I just sent...I misspelled NASH County ((END));35.9600112244898;-77.8155408163265
Witnessed a bright stationary object seen next to passing jet travelling at cruise altitude.;2008-01-28 16:20:00;15 seconds;Witnessed a bright stationary object seen next to passing jet travelling at cruise altitude. I witnessed a bright stationary object next to passing jet travelling in a south west direction at cruise altitude. Clear blue skies were present. I was outside my office and I looked up at a passing commercial jet.  As the jet passed over, it flew by a stationary bright (white in color) object, I could not tell the actual size or altitude of the object. Based on my observation it appeared to be slightly larger than the jet with no wings. It did not have a well defined shape, but it was close to rectangular with lumps on each side. It was sort of blurry with no sharp edges.  I don't think it was the same altitude of the jet because the passing aircraft did not alter course. The object could have been above or below the aircraft. The distance between the jet and object was about the width of a pencil held at arms length. At first glance I thought maybe it was a clump of balloons however when I took out my cell phone camera to snap a picture and looked back u! p, the object had vanished.  I knew where to look because the aircraft contrail was still present.  I searched for it for another 5 minutes, but could not locate. I wish I had kept my eyes on it.  Note:  This event occurred in January 2008 and had made note of immediately afterward.  I’m just now reporting because I wasn’t aware of this site.  Also, I'm a retired USAF SNCO (1981-2001) and very familiar with all types of aircraft.;35.9600112244898;-77.8155408163265
