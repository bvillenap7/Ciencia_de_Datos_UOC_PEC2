I was stopped at a red light on Falls Rd. heading west. To my right I looked up at the clouds North, hoping for rain, among a lot of light lines I  thought I was seeing a white balloon tangled on the lines, but when the red light changed to green I moved slowly and got a better  view. I realized the object was coming out of the clouds downward, in a zig-zag, falling leaf fashion, then thinking I was seeing a parachute coming down, I stopped to get a better view and looked for the lines and person but there was only this round white object about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It appeared to be landing. As I drove on the trees and houses on the street obstructed my view of it.;35.9600112244898;-77.8155408163265
Small silvery round object fades away from sight in seconds.;2013-01-24 07:48:00;10 seconds;Small silvery round object fades away from sight in seconds. I was on my way to work at the stop light in front of NC Wesleyan College and near McDonalds.  The small silvery or white round object in the sky in front of me caught my eye.  It did not move and just faded away while I was sitting at the red light.  It was not a plane or anything that looked normal. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Hexagon shaped object connected to bright star moving and disappearing in air.;2015-07-20 23:00:00;1 hour;Hexagon shap object connected to bright star moving and disappearing in air. I was sitting and looking in the sky, and noticed more stars than usual.  Friends said that since the planet moves, the stars rotate, so they move every night, but these stars don't. They are brighter than other stars, and one night I saw one move.  It was zig zagging across the sky and I know for sure it wasn't a plane or helicopter because they don't move the way this object did it moved back and forth for like 10 min then I kept watching it alone and I saw the light was attached to something big and it moved and disappeared in the darkness but the star it was attached to is still visable.   Also today my brother seen something flying over a neighbors house and it was the scariest thing he has ever seen.    At first I thought it was only me but know other people are noticing this stuff too I wish we had a good telescope to see what these stars are.  I didn't call the hotline because I don't really think this people actually take this stuff serious but if anyone does please feel free to contact me or visit my neighborhood so we can watch together.  I'm almost sure you will notice something weird.   And just so you guys know its not a satellite or weather balloon ive looked up all options and none make sense.  Weather balloons don't flash colors in the sky do they? The colors where white, red, blue, and green.  I don't know what my brother saw but this kind of stuff interest me and I would really like to know what these stars are in the sky and what are the things we see flying around.  Also lately alot of shooting stars have been around my area.  Weird because I've never seen them happen so often.  And it happens so fast you don't have time to record or you wouldn't be able to recognize anything from a regular phone camera because its so high in the sky. If you don't believe me oh well, but I would waste my time filling out this stuff if I didn't want to get some logical answers about what me and my friends are seeing.;35.9600112244898;-77.8155408163265
