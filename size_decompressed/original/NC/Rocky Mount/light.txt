The light in the sky;2002-04-20 02:30:00;2 minutes;The light in the sky I was working outside. Im in law enforcment and this is kinda odd. Any way i was outside just looking up taking a break cause i heard that on this night was sopposed to be some kinda planetary alignment well i looked straight up and saw two bright lights i assumed where plants. After about a minute i thought i was getting dizzy because they appeared to be moving like rotating one around the other so i looked down to make sure i wasnt seeing things. When i looked back up the one light moved away from the other slowly and it slowly got faint till it dissapeared like it was rising. The thing that is weird is there was no flashing lights no colors just a constant white light. sorry to bother you just figured i would tell someone i feel kinda odd. Thanks for being here.;35.9600112244898;-77.8155408163265
