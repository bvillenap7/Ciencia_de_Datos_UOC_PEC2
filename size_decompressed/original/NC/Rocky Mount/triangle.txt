Between calls for service I was standing with 3 other officers and happened to look up and observed a large triangular shaped craft. Few details could be seen but it was a clear night and the star field was noticeably broken up by the craft. I could get a sense that it was very large(maybe 150ft+ on each of the triangle sides) It appeared to be at a low altitude, perhaps 2000-3000 ft. There were no lights emitted by the craft.  We tried to light it up with flash light but the craft was too far to see any apparent reflection.  The craft was moving very slowly (15-20mph) traveling from ESE to WNW heading from Jacksonville, NC.  The craft made no noise.  We contacted the local airport and they reported no radar contact.  After 10-25 minutes we received a call for service from the local hospital.  Staff there had observed the craft and were inquiring about it. We attempted to make! contact with it again but were unable to locate it. I had served 10 years in the Marines stationed on airbases and as a hobby painted pictures of military equipment including aircraft. I had a good working knowledge of the state of military and civilian aviation at the time. I in no way recognized the craft observed that night.;35.9600112244898;-77.8155408163265
