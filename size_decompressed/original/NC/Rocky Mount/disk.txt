I looked up and I saw somehting aproaching me at pretty fast rate of speed, I would say it was atleast 100 feet away from me and 200 feet in the sky. There wasent a cloud in the sky so I could see pretty clearly. The craft I saw had a yellowish green glowing tent to it and it made no sound, then the craft started to drift back slowly and then it shot of into the sky at a very high rate of speed. I was fishing at Stony creeck about 45 pm when I saw an object aproaching me at a very fast fast rate of speed. There was not a cloud in the sky so I could see pretty clearly wat the object was and I was sure that it was nothing that I had ever seen before in my life. The object had yelloish green tint and it had changing lights on the base of the craft. When it aproached me and came to a complete stop. It just huvered in the same place for about 30 seconds, and shot of into the sky verry quickly. The object was shaped like a saucer. That was the first and the last time I went fishing in that spot late at night, even though I hevent seen the craft again.;35.9600112244898;-77.8155408163265
