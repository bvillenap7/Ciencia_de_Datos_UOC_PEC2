Space Traverlers Object came throgh a circle in space  then emitting  smaller objects . I am a truck driver and was heading east on route 97 heading toward Rocky Mount N.C. It was clear and a million stars were out when I happen to glance up through my windshield to see what seemed to be flickering sparkles of fire, the kind you see flooting down after a firework goes off! This went on for about 15seconds and behind the flickering I saw a perfect circle of gray so I pulled to the side of the road! NO TRAFFIC was coming as it was a country road and late! I stepped out on my running board to get a better look. I know the gray hole in space was there because it blocked the view of the stars that were just there! When the hole dissappeared an object, completely black began moving notheast at a slow speed not making a sound or non that I could hear. Once again I know it was there because it black out the stars as it moved only to see them reappear as it moved forward! Size was hard to tell but it seemed big with no lights and distance was hard to judge because of night. Then after about a minute 12 objects seemed to come from the object at fast speeds.They were or seemed to be just balls of light that race out in all directions from the craft! I stood amazed as I watched these objects do fast sprints away and back to the object! They could stop on a dime and excellerate to high speeds in as instant! Some would circle the craft as I could see then go behind the craft only to re appear on the other side ! I will never forget it as Long as I live!The big craft just moved slowly toward the northeast with the smaller crafts manuvering back and forth around the craft! this went on for at least 20 mins and I could still see the stars blackening out and re appearing as I stepped back into my truck and drove on to our yard! I should have written to you before now but I know what I saw! I listen to coast to coast and have an open mind!I was just setting here at home watching about oufo coverups on scifi network and felt compelled to write you! I know because of the time factor involved theres not much you can do with my account But i know what I saw was real ! I believe that space travel can be achieved by bending space or worm holes like the one I think I saw that night !Thank you for your time! Firmly a believer since that night. Just wanted to finally tell someone! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.9600112244898;-77.8155408163265
Loud heavy metal object;2019-10-08 03:35:00;3 minutes;Loud heavy metal object Was sitting in the living room when we heard what we though as first as a airplane, then we realized the sound wasn’t moving but getting closer and heavier.  It sounded like a very heavy metal object, we stepped outside for a look but we couldn’t see anything.  It lasted for about 2 1/2 minutes.  You could see heavy vibration waves in the air.  Then it took off but you still couldn’t see a object but you could hear it in the distance as it left.;35.9600112244898;-77.8155408163265
