Four orange light formation moving slowly across the sky in eastern north carolina.;2011-12-28 22:30:00;20 minutes;four orange light formation moving slowly across the sky in eastern north carolina. I saw four Orange lights in a half circle formation slow moving across the sky.  I could not tell if it was four independent objects or one extremely large one.  If it was one object it would be huge.  I was in the car so I couldn't tell if there was any noise with the formation.  When I pulled the car over the lights had all disappeared.;35.9600112244898;-77.8155408163265
