Bright glowing ball moving across North Carolina over Fontana Lake.;2017-04-15 01:00:00;15 minutes;Bright glowing ball moving across North Carolina over Fontana Lake. My friend and I were night fishing for walleye on Fontana Lake.  The moon was almost full, which allowed us to see very clearly even though it was 1 am.   As we trolled the bank, we noticed a glowing ball traveling parallel over the mountain top.  The object moved slowly at a steady pace.  After watching it for about 10 minutes, we decided to try and get video.   As my friend was preparing his camera, the object disappeared, as if the light just “went out”.  As soon as the camera was up and running, it reappeared, along the same path and direction it had been traveling.  We got about 10-20 seconds of the object, at which point it disappeared for the last time.  We never saw it again.   Here is a link to the video we uploaded to youtube. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-KnE1o1J5aY ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.3662;-83.5639
