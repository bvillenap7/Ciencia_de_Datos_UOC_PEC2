At first I thought it was a plane waiting to land staying still for clearance but then I remembered the hour and that there are no flight coming in this late here in my town. I  noticed lots of similar bluish color circle lights and some blinking at first I though planes again and was intrigued by the planes that were flying under the radar with no sound.  Thatâ€™s when it really hit me.  I recorded the light and around it took pictures. and brought my wife out to see it also and she was confused also.  We stood their for a good 3 to 4 minutes then walked in the house after researching online about these sighting .  I went outside again to see if the light was there and there was nothing more the other lights I thought were stars .  Black sky with some planes coming through .;35.2932;-82.3825
