I first thought they were 4 helicopters and then realized they were not and i called for my wife to come take a look. she grabbed her smartphone and took 2 photos and i will send you them with this report.   they appeared to be moving as shaking left to right when i first saw them they were not that far up in the sky but as they flew over our home we went to the back porch which is covered  i grabbed my binoculars and by the time i got outside in the back-yard and got one of them into my binoculars you could barley see it.  I had the wife then look it up on google and found this sight that is why i am sending this report.;35.2932;-82.3825
