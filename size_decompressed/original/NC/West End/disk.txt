My sister and i were coming home last night, when i noticed the lights in the sky. We live in a somewhat rural area, and also very close to an Aviation Tower, which directs airplanes, so at first i just thought it was a plane. But then when i noticed that for the moon being in the smallest part of it's phase, and it being very dark out, it was flying very close to tree level. Then when i noticed that it wasn't moving, i asked my sister if she thought that it seemed abnormal and i pointed out to her all of the things that i've listed. The craft was directly over the woods next to my house, so as we were coming down our driveway, we both had a very good view of it. We both saw the lights on it and saw that it was circular shaped, and that it wasn't moving, it was just hovering there, and wasn't making any noise. When i came in my house, i stood at the kitchen window, and we could both see the lights coming over the treetops, and i waited for about ten minutes, because i knew that if it was a plane, then it would fly over, but after ten minutes, the lights didn't even seem to move, my neighbors might have seen this also, but i am 100% sure that we saw a ufo last night. I also noticed one more, VERY strange thing, the radio on my alarm clock did not work at all, i tried to change stations and i turned the volume all the way up and there was no sound whatsoever.;35.2485;-79.5327
