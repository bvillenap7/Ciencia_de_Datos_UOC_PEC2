Blinking light being chased by a military (?) aircraft...;2007-03-24 21:35:00;2 Minutes;Blinking light being chased by a military (?) aircraft... My wife and I began to walk home from the neighbors around 21:35.  We were looking up at the sky as it was a perfectly clear night with a crescent moon.  I saw a blinking white light zipping along from north, north east to south, south west.  I pointed it out to my wife “look a satellite, watch it blink as it tumbles” we watched it until just past 90 degrees directly over us.  Then my wife noticed a second object, “Look there’s another one!” only this one wasn’t flashing.  I thought “that’s odd that two would be orbiting so close together.  We’re lucky to see this.”  As the second light passed 90 degrees above us I could make out a flashing collision light that seemed to be mounted to the tail of an aircraft, and we immediately heard the sound of a jet that struck me as quite loud (the first object made no sound at all which had me convinced that we were looking at a satellite).  The distance between the two was maintained until they both disappeared from our view. I would estimate that the objects were around three to five miles apart as they were the distance of a 12” ruler held at arms length.  Both objects were moving quite rapidly and were only visible to us for around 45 seconds.  We could hear the jet well after it was out of sight.  We live near the approach corridor for Charlotte Douglas Int'l, so we are familiar with the behavior, look, and sound of civilian jet aircraft.  We heard this jet for nearly a minute after it was out of sight.  My wife even commented on how long we could still hear it, “is that the jet we still hear?”.  This leads me to believe that this was a military aircraft chasing something with the afterburners lit.  This would explain our still hearing it even after it was long of sight, and both aircraft appeared to be at extremely high altitude.  My guess would be between 35 to 45 thousand feet as neither appeared much larger than the stars that were visible.  Military aircraft are never seen near here due to the high concentration of civilian aircraft that pass over our area.

Bright object fell from sky for 2-3 seconds, disappeared for 1 sec, then reappeared and fell 2-3 more sec.;2011-11-08 19:00:00;5 seconds;Bright object fell from sky for 2-3 seconds, disappeared for 1 sec, then reappeared and fell 2-3 more sec. I am a 44 year old wife and mother.  I work in the public school system, and I was getting in to our family van to go into town for groceries...  When all of a sudden I saw a light object, toward the North, coming straight down (it looked sort of like a falling star) and after 2 to 3 seconds, it completely disappeared.   Then, one second later it reappeared closer to the ground, for another 2 to 3 seconds.  Then it disappeared completely.   It was extremely brilliant, and seemed closer that the typical shooting star.   WOW, it was amazing!!!   It happened at exactly 7:00 pm EST (I looked at my watch immediately, and it had only been dark for a short time outside, and was still super bright.   Thank you!   My daughter was with me when it happened, and she was turned away from it, so did not see it.  However, she can certainly back up my excitement and rambling on and on about what I had just seen, and what she had just missed.;34.9952457772333;-80.536507955935
Weird flashing lights that went off completely and had a random sequence and then a ripple effect.;2019-10-25 18:30:00;3 minutes;Weird flashing lights that went off completely and had a random sequence and then a ripple effect. My daughter and I were driving in downtown Monroe when we saw some flashing lights in the sky.  I thought it was just a plane, but the lights looked more like a cool white LED, rather than plane lights I’m used to seeing.  The flashed in an unusual sequence that reminded me of Morse code.  Then, the lights went off!  They came back on and flashed in a sort of random sequence and went off again.  My daughter tried to get video, but was unable to.  The lights then had a ripple effect.  We were driving and lost track of it because of trees.  While it was dusk, there was not a sunset behind where these lights were sighted, it was a darker, blue sky.  You could only see the lights, not the shape of the craft.;34.9952457772333;-80.536507955935
