Monroe NC Unexplained stationary hovering lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial bodies??  PD));2007-12-03 21:45:00;ONGOING;Monroe NC Unexplained stationary hovering lights There are 3 objects that we thought were stars at first or even planes, but after 40 minutes these objects appear to move slightly away but stay in same general area over 1 hour and are still visible to us! The colors change from green to red to a touch of blue, with even a shade of white at time, but will go full bright green too! They constantly blink non stop.... We can't figure out the shapes on these things, but do know they are lined up like connect the dots with the 3 objects being the top of a triangle. I almost forgot that I took pictures outside and only the one object appears, but camera will not pick up the other two objects and batteries went dead after 4 pictures and these are new batteries, but within 5 minutes of returning back inside the house batteries worked fine! We started watching these abjects around 9:45 pm but it is now 11:10 pm and they are still visible.;34.9952457772333;-80.536507955935

The light changed colors, colors are as followed red, green, white, and orange.   At 9:35 (sic.  p.m.), the craft moved to the right, making its appearance more clear.  The craft was a cubed shaped aircraft.   The lights were both on top and bottom of the craft.  The craft had tripod bottom.  It stayed in that position for about 5 minutes.   At 9:45, the craft started slowly moving upward towards the sky, then shot off.;34.9952457772333;-80.536507955935
