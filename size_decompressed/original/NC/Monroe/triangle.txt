A triangular object with white and blue lights flying toward a airport then abruptly away;2012-11-27 19:15:00;45 seconds;A triangular object with white and blue lights flying toward a airport then abruptly away I live near a small municipal airport and Iâ€™m used to seeing low flying planes and have learned pretty much how to figure out the model of airplane.  But at around 1930 on tuesday night I pulled up to an intersection and witnessed a what appeared to be a plane flying very low, by the way it was a rainy night with very low cloud cover, it was a triangular shaped object with a white light on the back end and a dim greenish blue light in the middle.  When I saw it I figured that it was a plane on approach but as I watched it seemed flying too fast for a safe landing.   When I saw the green light I thought it was a landing light and I waited for a blinking strobe which is a requirement for all airplanes but witnessed none.  I brought it to the attention of my grandmother in the passenger seat and as the time she looked up and saw it accelerated hard right and went behind a house.  I stepped on the pedal to get to the top of a hill and see it again but it was gone.  I am very used to seeing low flying planes and helis but this was unlike I have ever seen.;34.9952457772333;-80.536507955935
