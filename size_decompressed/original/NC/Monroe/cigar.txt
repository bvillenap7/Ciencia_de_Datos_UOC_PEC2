Vertical, orange, cigar shaped craft.;2015-07-27 21:12:00;10 minutes;vertical, orange, cigar shaped crafts I notice a vertical, cigar-shaped, orange light in the west sky.  It sat still and did not move. Then 2 more shot up from what looked like the ground, like a rocket.  They moved away from the still object.   Then 2 more done the same thing and moved away in the opposite direction.  All the while the first object never moved.   Then out of nowhere, it just disappeared in a blink of an eye.  It was gone.   I have never in my life witnessed anything like it.  They were not planes or drones and most definitely not fireworks.  It kind of startled me and made me a little nervous only because I never seen anything like it.;34.9952457772333;-80.536507955935
