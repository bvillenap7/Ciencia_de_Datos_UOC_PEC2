The object went over Popular St. Heading towards Hey 211 towards Bethesda Cemetery in Aberdeen.  It moved over my head slowly about 1000 ft up and left.   The deer in the area went the direction after the craft or light went through the sky.  I heard Helicopters I believe from the Military went after it.  I called the Moore County Airport, they said they didn't get any call about something in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
