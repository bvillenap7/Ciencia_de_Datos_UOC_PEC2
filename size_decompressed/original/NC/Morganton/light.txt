Orange light splits into three pieces;1980-06-01 22:00:00;20 minutes;Orange light splits into three pieces Four of us stood on the porch on a warm, clear evening. I was watching airliners flying over at about 30,000 feet, headed to the airport at Charlotte, sixty miles away. The planes were just lights with no sound. They followed the same path, one every five minutes or so. Then another light came along, an orange light the looked just like the others, but this one split into three pieces. I thought I had just seen a plane blow up and pointed this out to my three friends. We saw one of the three lights continue towards Charlotte while another turned north and the third light turned in our direction and seemed to hang in the sky. We assumed the light was at airliner altitude, but when I went out to the car to get some binoculars, I saw that the light moved against the backdrop of stars when I moved. This indicated that the light was much lower than we thought, perhaps only two hundred feet. The light drifted slowly over town and we followed it in a car, easily able to keep up. At one time, we saw a series of fire balls shooting out of the bottom like a Roman candle. This scared us, but nothing happened. The light drifted out of town. We pulled into a church parking lot and got out to watch. The orange light suddenly accelerated very quickly and was out of sight in a few seconds.

Large amount of lights on a mountain about tree top level;1998-02-27 21:00:00;1 hour;Large amount of lights on a mountain about tree top level Driving home from work, these bright lights caught my attention , on this mountain that was about a mile from where I was, I drive home this way every night and I had never seen any lights on this mt. This was a large amount of lights and at first I thought that they was moving around but after stopping my truck and watched for awhile I summed up that the lights wasn't moving and that they didn't remind me of car lights for as I watched and moved about looking at this that it was just as bright from any spot that I looked at them where as car lights would be going in one stright direction and if you moved to a different angle and looked at them they would look different( not as bright) but no matter where I moved to and looked at them , other than the trees blocking the view, they was just as bright. After about 10 -15 min. watching this I raced home , about 5 miles from this spot , to get my binoculars, I was in my house about 5-10 min.then raced back to where I was watching this, thinking that it would be gone, but it was still there. In the same spot from what I could tell. I found a spot to pull over and from here with the binoculars I could tell , whatever it was that it was about tree top level and from my viewing spot it was behind some trees , so I tried to move to a different area and couldn't find a spot to pull over , so here I am in the middle of the road ( in a good spot now , with a break in the trees where it was at) I couldn't make out what I was seeing other than it was bright and lighting up the top of the mt. and I didn't see anything under the lights , but I didn't get long in this new viewing spot due to another car came up and I had to move and at the same time I noticed that I was a hair away from being out of gas and fearing that if it moved that I would follow and run out of gas and taking a chance of going for gas and coming back. Gas was about 2-3 miles away and you guessed it, When I got back it was gone. Went driving around but didn't see anything else. Came home and called the sheirff's office to see if they had any calls on this and was told no. And tried to sum up what I had seen. The best that I can sum up is that it looked liked something I had seen from a movie (as in Fire In The Sky) where that object was lighting up the woods. It was light lots of bright flood lights in a large circle and lighting up the whole area. No noise, to me this ruled out a plane or hellicopter, while I was looking at this , it wasn't like looking at headlights, with binoculars you would be able to tell that it was headlights.It wasn't moving from what I could tell , the lights wasn't flickering it was just like it was just hanging there. It was a clear night, you could see stars but then a couple of hours later we had bad fog roll in. I was looking north, but I'm sure I wasn't looking at a star or airplane for this light was on that mountain. I know that that I shouldn't had left but I kept thinking that it would still be there when I got back just to find out that I was watching a new house with alot of flood lights around it but that's not the case cause it was gone when I got back.;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551
Fast moving cluster of erratic white lights spotted over western NC.;2001-04-28 23:55:00;20 seconds;Fast moving cluster of erratic white lights spotted over western NC. A cluster of 5 white lights followed by one singular white light,each similar in brightness to the brightest stars. They moved as a group from East toward West. They did not move in straight lines but did move in an irregular or sporatic nature. There was NO sound! Not during nor after they passed from view. We were only able to see them for about 20 seconds. They seemed to be at least 5 miles high, possibly much higher. They did not look like any known aircraft. We are 49 and 52 year old married couple. Well educated, professional adults. We have never before seen any UFO's. It was absolutely amazing!;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551

Looked identical to a star, but it moved like crazy, and NOT a shooting star.;2011-11-06 23:00:00;2 to 3 minutes;Looked identical to a star, but it moved like crazy, and NOT a shooting star. Me and my sister saw two disc, i say disc for lack of a better word, that looked EXACTLY like a star to the naked eye.  They both were hovering in practically broad daylight when we first saw them.  We could not understand why no one else could not see them, because even though they looked like stars to the naked eye, they were both moving, or hovering in the air.  Fast forward to 11 p.m. that night, and we were outside of my house, and sure enough, we caught a glimpse of apparently the same craft, but this time it was just one.  I swear that it looked just like a start moving, and I brought out my telescope and looked and looked and looked trying to see if I could make out anything besides a bright star looking object that was hovering.  I could not, and slowly from the north east it hovered until right over the mountain range by my house, and slowly hovered down disappearing from sight down into the mountain range. Scared us to death.  Hope someone else saw this! same phenomenon last night.  This is NOT A FAKE SIGHTING. ill put my reputation on it.;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551

We saw a bright white light in the sky surrounded by airplanes.;2015-03-28 10:00:00;unknown;we saw a bright white light in the sky surrounded by airplanes. My boyfriend my roommate and I stepped outside to get some air and look at the stars and noticed a bright burning white light in the sky.  It was not a star.  It was brighter than the stars.  There were airplanes circling all around the object.  At least four planes were in the sky with this object.  When we first saw it, it was extremely bright and bi.  Then it seemed to get dimmer and farther away.  Then it looked like it was coming towards us. Then it remained in the same spot just became more dim.  By this time most of the planes had left, there were only one or two left in the sky with the light.  We got tired of waiting out there because it was freezing cold so we went back in the house.  About an hour later we went back outside to go to the store and it was gone.;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551
