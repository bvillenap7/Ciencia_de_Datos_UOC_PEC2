March 20 approximately 5am while in my hot tub outside on the deck a light reflecting off my house was observed coming from behind my house. It lit up the house roof line and several trees close to the house. It appeared to brighten and rise for only 10 seconds. It appeared almost as bright as a car headlight. Only the reflection of light was seen off the house and trees. No object was observed. This is the second time the same incident has occurred. The previous event was a number of years earlier and was observed by another witness in the room where reflected light came in through the window off the walls and moved up and was gone.;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551
Large objects flying over I-40.;2014-03-29 00:20:00;1 minutes;large objects flying over I-40 I had jus left work heading home & as I was getting on interstate 40e ext 103, I witnessed a large object almost the size of the four lanes flying just over the tree top....it had white lights on each side and a red light in the middle & was going about the speed of a hot air balloon?  As I got closer and could see the sky better I witnessed two more of the objects coming in from the opposite direction.  They all crossed paths over the 105 ext!  The craft I had been watching few s.e. over the tree tops til I lost site of it!   A lot of people were out that night....I just hope somebody else saw what I experienced that can maybe help explain what I seen.;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551
