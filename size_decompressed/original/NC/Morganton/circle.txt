Red Object over my backyard.;1993-12-10 19:30:00;20 seconds;Red Object over my backyard. On this date, I was putting wood in my woodstove, which is located in my den. The den has a window which is level with the front yard. The ground was covered with snow, about an inch, maybe a bit more. As I was putting the wood in, I noticed the whole front yard was red. Assuming my chimminey was on fire, I ran upstairs and went to the deck which is located in the back of the house. As I went past my mother, which at that time was living with my wife and I, I told her, I think my chimminey is on fire! Once I opened the sliding door which leads to the deck, she was behind me. As I looked outside, the whole back yard was bright red. Looking toward the chimminey I realized it was not on fire. I looked around and saw a bright red round object over my backyard. It looked like a red spotlight, but big. I would say it was about 100 yards above the backyard. The exact size is hard to decribe due to the brightness of the light, as if looking into a spotlight. But it was bigger than, let's say, a full size van. It hovered there for a few seconds and shot straight up, faster then anything I have ever seen, a loud boom followed and it disappeared going up. It disappeared in less than a second or two. Being ex-U.S. Army, a Sgt (E-5) with the 82nd ABN, two combat tours, I know it was not a military plane or helicopter. The boom, it is my opinion was the sound barrier being broken due to the speed it went up. I have seen many weapons and planes/helicopters in action, I have seen F-15's and F-16's fly over my head low, but nothing will compare to how fast this object shot straight up, even faster than missiles being shot from a MRLS vehicle. The speed was undescribable. One curious thing is that it did not emit any sound, as in a motor running, only the boom as it went up. My next door neighbor came out to his deck and yelled at me, Did you shoot a shotgun?! I told him no, I didn't but had heard a noise, not figuring he would understand what I had just seen. My mother saw the object also. I know it ! was not a military plane. I am not sure about the exact date, but I am sure it was around December of '93. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Bright white pulsating, top shaped object with intermittent red, green, blue, purple lights with tail. ((NUFORC Note:  Stars?  PD));2011-11-08 23:00:00;3 hrs;A bright white pulsating, top shaped object with intermittent red, green, blue, purple lights with a small tail. Last night a friend and I noticed a very bright, top shaped light appear south east of Morganton, N.C..  The object barely moved with no sound, and flashed red, blue, and white intermittent light.   After 10 minutes another object appeared 1 mile northeast of the other with the same features.   I went home and got my wife out of bed to observe them, while my friend called his cousin outside to witness the objects.  We live 7 miles apart and stayed in touch by text messaging.   I viewed the first one with binoculars and it seemed to pulsate and had a tail similar to a comet, but had very intense streaks of red, green, blue, and purple light while the main body stayed very bright white.  The moon and was in 3/4 stage far to the west of the objects.  We did witness man made aircraft passing under the first object.  The aircraft was dwarfed by the object we saw.  I could not see the second light from my house because of trees, but my friend, 7 miles north west could see both.  In 47 years, I have never saw anything like it.  I witnessed the Halle-Bopp comet in 1997 but these objects seemed much closer to the earth.   A few days ago I learned the local news reported a UFO sighting over Lake James, which is approximately 10 miles northwest from our sightings.   The background was clear sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Stars?

4 Red and orange pulsating circle objects slowly ascending till disapear.;2011-12-26 21:30:00;2-5 mins;4 Red and orange pulsating circle objects slowly ascending till disapear. We was outside talking and my wife said what is that over the tree line. I looked up and saw a red and orange cirle like object that was pulsating and moving in a slight zig-zag motion up torward the sky really slowly. It seemed to almost stop a couple times.  Then we seen another one come straight out of the tree line in the same spot not zig-zag, but just slowly raise straight up.  Then a third one same spot raised up slowly, by this time the first one had almost disapeared.  Then the fourth alot closer to the third than the rest.  They all pulsated, no noise, really creepy.  Had me and my wife not seen this together we both said we would have not believed the other.  Never seen anything ufo like in my life, never believed it was true. I hope I never see anything like that again.  I still have cold chills a hour later.;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551

This is the second time my family has been outside and seen several circular objects with flashing lights glide across the sky.
