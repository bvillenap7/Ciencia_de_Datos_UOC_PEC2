Sphere accelerates at high rate.;1988-07-04 12:30:00;30 sec;Sphere accelerates at high rate. I was coming home from morning work along on I-40 headed east.  At the Jamestown exit I looked up and there it floated.  Mirrored Sphere at around 1,000 ft elevation above ground.  It floated towards east for a few seconds then accelerated at a tremendous rate to the east and parallel to the ground.  Sky was very clear and cloudless.  This object dwindled into the distance and faded to a speck and was gone in 3-4 sec.  Acceleration was multiple high G.  No sonic boom heard although it passed Mach easily.  I was driving at slow rate and had my windows open.  This was an incredible phenomena.  I am a professional engineer now but was 18 at the time.  This object behaved as if it had very exotic propulsion system.  I speculate gravity control or magneto-hydrodynamic drive?!   Very amazing!;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551
Large Silver Levitating Ball;1989-07-04 12:30:00;30 sec;Large Silver Levitating Ball Object Flew roughly west to east at unknown elevation. At first it floated then it accelerated at an unbelievable rate. It passed Mach but made no boom?! Flew off level into the distance in a few moments. Very real observation under perfectly clear atmospheric conditions by a future mechanical engineer.;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551
