Bright blue/white light shot up and across sky;2018-08-22 04:23:00;Seconds;Bright blue/white light shot up and across sky I woke up at 4am and decided to step outside for a cigarette before I had to get my husband up for work.  When I finished, I went inside and remembered that I had to go to the atm and I had to do it before my husband woke up and left at 5:30.   As I stepped outside and walked to the car, I noticed that the area was lit up with a dim bright light almost like a streetlight was turning back on.  I almost didn’t pay attention to it while I was walking by, but I remembered that there isn’t a light there so I looked up.   As I looked up, there was a bright blue/white flash of light above me that resembled a circular shape and then it shot up and across the sky.   I stood there for a minute trying to find an explanation of what had happened and couldn’t.  Nothing happened again for the remainder of the early morning.;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551
