The object was at quite a distance, so it is difficult to describe.  The bottom was round and covered in white lights.  With binoculars, it sort of resembled an old Gemini space capsule.  There was a brighter light on top.  With the naked eye, it looked like a cluster of flashing lights, some of which were red.  However, whatever it was did not move for at least 30 min.  It was a clear night and there were several stars visible and quite a few planes passing by, so it was obvious it was neither a star nor a plane.  About fifteen minutes after first  sighting the object, it emitted a small, circular disk from it, which flashed red and moved very quickly away, it a southwest direction from the main object.  We watched the object for about another 15 minutes, and then it finally started moving very, very slowly until we could no longer see it behind a line of trees..  Our apt. faces north, toward Boone, NC.  Though my husband has seen a UFO before (many years ago over Atlanta, Ga.), I have not and have never believed in them.  Our daughter does not believe in them either.  But I admit, this was unlike anything I have ever seen before in my life.  I do not know what it was, but it was not a star, a plane, or a balloon.;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551
