Morphing inter dimensional white or silver craft;2019-12-07 17:45:00;10 seconds;Morphing inter dimensional white or silver craft While driving down interstate 40 near morganton, I witnessed an explosion in the sky. The light was silver grey and the sky was starting to get dark, but still had blue. It was the explosion that caught my attention. I immediately looked and it was almost as if “something” had burst through a portal and as soon ans I could look at the object, it was as if it began to sort of morph and compact or change shape in some way. Instantly it zipped to the west heading toward rutherfordton.  Once again there was a white or silver light as the object flew away.;35.7329761224492;-81.7081293877551
