Looked north @ 50° and noticed a white Orange light. At first I thought it was an aircraft and didn't pay much notice.;2014-07-06 21:15:00;~5 minutes;Outside grilling. Looked north @ 50° and noticed a white Orange light. At first I thought it was an aircraft and didn't pay much notice to it.   I flipped the food on the grill and began talking to a friend and looked up and the light was still there but a more orange color.  Object hadn't moved.   I continued to observe the light for movement.  There was none.   Light became more intense and shifted to a red/orange and began to blink/flicker for about 30 seconds then disappeared. I had thought I witnessed a stellar occurrence such as a supernova.;34.6954;-76.7402
Small white lights moving quickly same paths;2021-08-29 22:00:00;>1 hour;Small white lights moving quickly same paths Laying on the beach at night close the the Ferris wheel on Carolina beach, small fast moving white lites in the sky  moving quickly,  sometimes making a small nimble change in direction, but most following the same path, most of the lights were traveling individually, but now snd the your would see a2 or 3 acting as if they are racing.  This same sighting was on both nights we were at the beach.  The lights are very small and unless you are focused on looking at stars you might miss them.  It almost appeared to be drones racing but the light was a single small white light on all of them.  No sound was observed.;34.6954;-76.7402
