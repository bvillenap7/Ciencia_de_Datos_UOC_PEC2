Caterpillar shape moving orange lights in the sky;2016-09-13 21:20:00;20;Caterpillar shape moving orange lights in the sky We were outside talking and saw a light.  I asked my friend what it was then two appeared.  They would blink on then wait several minutes blink off.  They then leap frogged over each other.  Then all of a sudden several appeared in succession out of the blue.  Then moved like a caterpillar in the sky.  Blinked on and off moved back into two visible then zipped off.  We walked across the street to the beach and ran into a group of people who had seen the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
