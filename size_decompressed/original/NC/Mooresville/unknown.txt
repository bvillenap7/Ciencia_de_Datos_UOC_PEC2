MY LIFE IS CHANGED BECAUSE OF THIS!!  ((anonymous report));1995-07-24 01:45:00;15-20 minutes;MY LIFE IS CHANGED BECAUSE OF THIS!! The mother of my child and I were smoking outside my grandpa's house near the street that's when we heard a weird noise unlike which we never heard but we just thought nothing of it until a few minutes later it happened again and It sounded like it was near one of the local high school campuses so after a couple more minutes it happens again (5 times total).   I tell her it's getting late you should get going home.  I posted a status on Facebook saying something weird is going on in the sky.  No later than 5 minutes one of my friends from high school comments on the status and says he seen lights floating through the sky when he was walking home!!!  The crazy part is his house is in the exact direction one of the noises was coming from.  AND A COUPLE MINUTES BEFORE IT HAPPENED IT GOT EXTREMELY FOGGY!!! I KNOW IT WAS A ENGINE I KNOW IT WASN'T HUMAN.  I have never went out of my way to report anything but this is really CRAZY!!

Strobing stars???;2003-09-20 23:30:00;hours;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect twinkling stars may have been the cause of the sighting.  PD)) Strobing stars??? For about a year or so, I have started to notice objects in sky that look like stars, but they don't twinkle like other stars, and they don't have a steady glow like planets.  These stars have a very refined, sharp light, not soft like stars. The lights have a very sharp contrast like a strobe light or laser light.  With the naked eye, one can tell that these objects oscillate between red, white, and blue colors.  With binoculars, I noticed that it APPEARS that the blue light is a steady glow in the upper left and upper right corners of the object.  The red light appears to be a steady glow in the lower right corner and the white seems to be flashing from the center. (NOTE: it's very difficult get binoculars in a steady enough position to view these things clearly.  I need a telescope) In the past couple of weeks, I have taken a notice to just how many there really are.  I see 4 of these stars in the Northeastern sky, spread pretty far apart, I see 3 in the Northwestern sky in a triangular pattern, and 3 in the Southwestern sky, in a straight line. I don't think these objects are geosynchronous satellites, because they are staionary like other stars.  Thier referenced positions change with the rotation of the Earth.  Because of where they are positioned, they never pass overhead with the planet's rotations, and all of them stay somewhat close to the horizon. If these are satellites, why would they have visible lights on them? I have a friend in Charlotte, who is 30 miles south of me, is able to see these objects.  My wife and my parents have seen them, as well. I would love to know how many other stargazers have noticed this, and if anyone has a good explanation, because right now, I really don't think these are stars.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237
4 bright lights traveling at a very high rate of speed.;2007-10-21 02:00:00;8 seconds;4 bright lights traveling at a very high rate of speed. I saw 4 bright lights traveling north to south traveling at a very high rate of speed.  Arrangement of lights were in a diamond formation.  Could not tell if it was one craft or four separate crafts.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237
Extremely bright light shot through the sky;2013-07-12 23:55:00;5 seconds;Extremely bright light shot through the sky Myself and 2 friends were outside on my patio right before midnight. It was partly cloudy skies, some stars.   The sky suddenly got really bright, as bright a a lightning strike, and stayed that way for about 3 seconds straight, we looked up and an extremely bright light was moving as fast as a falling star, but much much much brighter.  I assumed it was a meteor at first, but I never saw a falling star as bright as a lightning strike.  My friend looked up about a second before i did, she said it had been hovering before it took off.  I sat there, thinking, that it might have been an ICBM for about a minute afterwards, and was listening for explosion, but there was no noise for about another 2 minutes, could have been thinder in the distance.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237

We both witnessed a slow moving light (blue in color) traveling slowly toward the SSW.   As it approached the horizon, it began to flash slowly but regularly and eventually disappeared over the horizon.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237
