Flying V over Lake Norman in NC on New Year's Eve;2018-01-01 00:25:00;3 minutes;Flying V over Lake Norman in NC on New Year's Eve Let dogs out to go potty at 12:25am on New Year's Eve and was immediately shocked to see 3 very bright lights flying in a V formation over Lake Norman in NC.  The lights were too large and too bright to possibly be any commercial aircraft and they were in a specific V or Triangle, flying faster than possible by airplanes.  It was also massive in size, could not be a drone.  They suddenly disappeared.  I was in shock.  This morning, I Googled to see if anyone else had seen the same thing and found videos from the Charlotte Observer that people had captured over NC about a week ago, 12/17.   The videos show the exact same thing I saw last night.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237
