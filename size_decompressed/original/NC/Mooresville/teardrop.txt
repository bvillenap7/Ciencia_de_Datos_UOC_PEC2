Orange lights over Mooresville, NC.;2014-07-04 22:30:00;30-45 minutes;Orange lights over Mooresville, NC My wife and I were watching the fireworks in our neighborhood. I noticed an orange light in the distance off and on between the houses.   Approx 10 minutes later it appeared moving in the sky again, this time my wife noticed it as well. We were in our pool about 15 minutes later and noticed 2 orange lights coming directly towards us and went directly overhead.  They were orange, kind of oval to tear drop shaped, one right behind the other (maybe 200- 300 feet behind the other)  No other lights, they were not pulsating (not Chinese lanterns) and most importantly NO sound whatsoever. Approx 5 minutes later a third light went directly over us the same as before. After that I saw two more objects off in the distance.  That was the last we saw of these objects. I’m new to the area so I’m guessing the came from the Northeast heading to the Southwest, moving quickly but not extremely fast.   Visible each time for a minute to a minute and a half before we lost sight of them.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237
