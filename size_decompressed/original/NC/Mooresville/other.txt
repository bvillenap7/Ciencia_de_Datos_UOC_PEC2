large, bright meteor seen over Mooresville, North Carolina.;2009-07-07 23:28:00;6 seconds;large, bright meteor seen over Mooresville, North Carolina. On July 7th at 11:28 p.m. I witnessed a very bright meteor passing over Mooresville, North Carolina. The meteor flew from west to east. The object was the size of a pea if held at arms length. It had a flaming trail behind it that was about two feet long at arms length.   The meteor was extremely bright and I was able to view it for about 6 seconds.  Our house and land sit on a rise that gives us a 360 degree view of the horizon.  This was one of the better meteor sightings I have seen.  Did anyone else see this amazing sight?

I was taking my dog out and I just by chance happened to see a bright flash in the sky.  I looked up to see what I can only describe a “scrambler” ride from the fair spinning in circle like a top and every time it spun around the arm had some “meteor blue” lights on each arm that swung around..  It didn’t have a repeating movement it was very irractic, but it just moved slowly right across the sky.. so profound!!!!!;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237
