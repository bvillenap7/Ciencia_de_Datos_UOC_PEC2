Saw shooting star and an oblong shape of light. Oblong shaped object was travelling due earth from zenith. It was a constant brightness and speed. It took 2 seconds from zenith to disappear in the eastern horizon.It was a clear night and it couldn't have been a reflection, plane, meteor, or anything else. It was huge! It was like the bottom was reflecting the ground.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237
Three large, round, bright orange lights coming together in the form of a rotating triangle;2007-10-13 20:28:00;5 minutes;Three large, round, bright orange lights coming together in the form of a rotating triangle It was after dark and my two daughters and their friend and I were headed north on Shearer’s Road and we saw three, bright, round, orange lights in the night sky (did not blink, no other colors) approaching from the western sky approximately 50-60 degrees high. We pulled into an office park up the road at the corner of Shearer’s and Timber and sat and watched the three lights, which were spread apart. They then came together into the formation of a triangle and rotated slowly, traveling toward us.  The lights then turned south and we lost sight.  Our daughter’s friend’s parents met us at the office park in their car to pick up their daughter and both adults also reported seeing the bright lights. My 12-year old daughter’s account:  When it was dark my mom, my sister, a friend and I were driving on the road just chatting when my mom suddenly blurted out, Look at those lights.!   I looked and they were moving slowly at an axis. They were orange round lights.  We pulled into a parking lot and started to watch it.  It was turning slowly and going down in the trees.  We saw the friend’s parents also sitting in the parking lot.  We pulled up next to them, taking our eyes of the object and told them about it.  They have also witnessed it.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237
Two slow moving bright orange orb shaped lights;2010-10-31 20:30:00;10 minutes;Two slow moving bright orange orb shaped lights Halloween night with hundreds of people out trick or treating.   Another adult and I were walking up the street in our neighborhood subdivision and spotted a brightly lit orange, orb-like light moving slowly from the north to the east about 50 to 60 degrees up in a clear, cloudless night sky.  As it moved to the north, it gradually dimmed and completely disappeared in mid-air.  At that time, we then approached two other adults we knew personally who said there was another orange light preceding the last one just minutes before going in the exact same direction and it disappeared the same way.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237

Observed three distinct glowing red orbs (or whatever they were) going due south, about 3 - 4 minutes apart as they passed over our house.  I have no idea what they were, they were not aircraft.  The last one was really bright red!!  One jet aircraft (definitely a jet) located slightly west of three objects, also proceeding in a southerly direction, between 2nd and 3rd red light.  Noticed at 22:01 hrs. Sighting lasted approximately 15 minutes.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237

2 really bright lights separately lit up my room, each lasting about 2.5 seconds.;2016-11-28 01:29:00;~5 seconds;2 really bright lights separately lit up my room, each lasting about 2.5 seconds. The light was really bright, and really white as well.  It appeared as though the object(s) moved from the left of my window to the right.  I was just trying to get some sleep because I have school the next day, and then all of a sudden I see two really bright lights flash and light my room up for roughly 5 seconds.  Each flash lasted about 2.5 seconds.  From the way the light looked the objects might have been orbs of some sort, maybe even a saucer.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237
