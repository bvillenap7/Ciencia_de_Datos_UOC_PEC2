UFO over Lake Norman, NC;2009-09-06 05:50:00;2 hours;UFO over Lake Norman, NC The event started around 1 am as me and my friend were watching videos on youtube about classified NASA reports regarding extraterestrials. A sound file was there and produced a high pitched noise that someone edited to play at a lower pitch. Some say it was alien speech, and I decided to record it to my phone for a ringtone. At about 4 am we were about to go to sleep and I decided to play the sound. I then turned my phone off, only to see it display a white screen with red lettering on it saying Fatal Error and a strange code. It wouldn't respond to any buttons so I removed the battery and restarted the phone. It worked. Around 5:50 am I was trying to get some sleep when i noticed a bright white glow outside of the window, at around aprox. 5000 ft. I pointed it out to my friend who also saw it. The light seemed to fade and then get brighter for a minute or two, then it dimmed until it almost wasnt visible and plumeted to earth at an extremely high speed. ! After about 5 min, it was back and about 1000-2000 ft higher than it was the first time. The light on it seemed to be making a sweeping motion and lingered in the same spot for a few seconds before moving on to something else. The craft then seemed to get closer and we were able to see it had a saucer-like shape to it. Around 6:15 am we saw a faint beam coming down from the craft that didn't last for very long, and seemed to stop right above the treeline. I decided to play the sound I had recored to see if that did anything, and it appeared that it drew the craft a bit closer to where we were, before returning to it's original location. The object's lights faded until it wasnt visible for about 10 min, then it appeared about another 2000 ft higher than it's previous location. Then it started to slowly rise for about 20 minutes before disappearing.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237
