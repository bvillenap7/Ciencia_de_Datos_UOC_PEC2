My friend and I were going on a walk and noticed a strange, bright, light hovering over the area of Lake Norman.  The light appeared white in color and extremely bright for the distance it appeared away from us.  Upon further examination, the light seemed to be made of four smaller lights clumped together shining bright enough to appear as one.  The light hovered in its location for roughly 30 seconds until it moved up about 20 degrees from our PoV and began hovering again.  Note, at this point it was thought that the light was a plane due to its movement speed and the way it moved.  The object, after hovering for roughly another 30 seconds slowly crept left and then began accelerating to a very fast speed which caused us to run across the road to continue seeing it.  We then lost sight of it after it went behind a line of trees that spans roughly 30 feet and then didn't appear from the other side.  I would normally be inclined to say this was a helicopter but if the lights were this bright, then it would be much closer and there would be a sound (there was no sound but the bugs at the time). Background:  I'm a pretty regular gu,y although I do suffer from pretty intense paranoia and have been told that I may be slightly schizophrenic.  My friend is also regular and only suffers from mild anxiety.  Other than that, neither of us were under the influence of any drugs or alcohol and were wide awake at the time.;35.578765887446;-80.8417842424237
