((anonymous report))  Large red glowing object in the eastern night sky.;2017-01-14 20:35:00;20 seconds;Large red glowing object in the eastern night sky. I was sitting on my porch looking into the night sky towards the east.  A red light appeared as if it turned on.  It was very large, larger than a star, and about half the size of the moon.  It started dim, but began glowing.   After hovering in place for a few seconds, it started to move slowly in the sky towards the right and then turned off.  It was bright red in color as if it were glowing.   It was difficult to determine the distance, but it appeared to be a mile or so away, but depending on the size, it could be different.
