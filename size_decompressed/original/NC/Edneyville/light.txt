For the first sighting, my neighbor witnessed it also. It had white, red, and blue lights. Our eyes could not focus on it very well, almost as if it changed from oval to triangular. It was close to us, not way up, but just on top of the hills. It sat motionless at first, that is how it got my attention. Then it started moving slowly over us, my neighbor and I. The blue lights were moving, like in a half circle.  This was about 8pm. About an hour or so later, I saw it again, only much higher up.  My second sighting, last night around 11pm, was even more bizarre. I was lying in bed, trying to relax, and my eyes drifted out the sliding glass door, and there was the light again, white with hints of colors, but this time it was as if it was drunk. It bobled around AND sat still periodically. We live in a fairly isolated area, so it was very dark but the sky was clear. This thing seemed to be hoovering just on top of the hills. There was zero noise for both sightings. It almost seemed as if this thing was trying to get my attention, and how strange for me to notice it in the first place, the way the blinds were nearly completely pulled, and the porch banisters and trees were in the way. It seemed to have personality. Was it a persons toy remote of some kind? I don't know. It was just WEIRD!!!!;35.3906;-82.3405
