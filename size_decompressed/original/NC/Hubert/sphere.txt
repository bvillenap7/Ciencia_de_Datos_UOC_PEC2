Dogs barking. Two unknown lights sighted South, Southeast in Hubert, N.C. on 30 May 07 at 2100 hours. Both objects appeared slightly smaller than the moon with a reddish orange light in the center surrounded by a white glow, and with a thin line circling the white glow. Objects were positioned horizonally to the right of the moon. Object on the left seemed about 5 moons over to the right of the moon.

(Definition of moon about the size of a dime when looking out at sky). Light on left stayed solid for about 20 seconds, then flashed off and then back on for another 20 seconds and then went out.
