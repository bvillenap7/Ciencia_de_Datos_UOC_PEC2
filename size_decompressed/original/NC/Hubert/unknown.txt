Pinkish red lights dropping white lights.;2017-09-14 23:30:00;5 minutes;Pinkish red lights dropping white lights. I was outside with my mother inlaw and husband.  My husband and I were looking at the stars.  I heard a thud noise.   I turned around and looked over where the top of my mother inlaw's house.  I saw 4 pinkish red lights in a line not that far from each other.  The one at the top had little white lights drop from under it.   I heard the thud noise again and 3 of them moved down.  I couldn't see them anymore.  The last one dropped some of those white lights and also moved down.  After that I could not see them anymore.;34.6993;-77.2078999999999
