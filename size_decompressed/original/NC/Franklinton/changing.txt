Red/Orange Shapeshifting Object Spotted and Flew Away.;2018-08-13 21:00:00;30 minutes;Red/Orange Shapeshifting Object Spotted and Flew Away Object appeared out of nowhere, and steadied over the tree line facing southeast.  Within minutes, it was changing colors (from orange to white, to blood red, to yellow and even hints of purple).  Green was also emitting at certain moments.  There was no definite shape to the object and a red aura was noticed by three witnesses around it.   Random spots of red, shapeshifting objects were spotted coming out of the main object itself, which we caught via photographs.  With the main object, there were three smaller objects progressing around and from it. After about 25 minutes of moving at a slower speed and changing shape, the object zoomed off into the sky within seconds, disappearing into the sky.;36.0901;-78.4517
