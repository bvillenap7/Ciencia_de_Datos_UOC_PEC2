One amber/orange colored, almost oblong fireball with no distortion or tail effects,viewed facing south and heading left to right at a very high rate of speed just above ground height. I would estimate a viewing angle of 50 degrees and a heading of west north west. Two adult wittnesses, one a seasoned hunter, the other a trained military observer(american,nato,soviet military and commercial aircraft id experience). This was in the Grove Hill area of Wilton NC.

Ball of fire falling westward from the sky.;2016-05-26 22:15:00;20 seconds;Ball of fire falling westward from the sky. It was a circular looking ball of fire falling towards the west.  There was just one in the sky.  It was burning as it was falling.   At first, I thought it was a shooting star but it was too large and too close.  I noticed that it looked like it was on fire and realized it was engulfed in flames. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
