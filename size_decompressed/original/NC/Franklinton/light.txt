We were driving back from a college class located near Wake Med, North Carolina. It was about 6:00pm. A normal night, slightly cloudy. However there were no clouds in the area of the sighting. We were listening to music joking around As we pulled into the sub division in which I reside. I looked out the rear window to enjoy the stars like I sometimes do. Upon looking I saw two orange/yellow lights in the sky. They initially were directly beside one another. Then coincidently as I looked my friend asked what I was staring at... he then looked back with me and slowed the car down to a near halt. At that exact moment the craft/light that was on the left side did a U turn going from being on the left side to quickly pacing under it and was then positioned on the right side. Almost simultaneously the light then shot up directly into the sky about a mile or two...and then sped up forward going over our head. All while the other light/craft stayed hovering motionlessly in the night sky. I couldn't make out the shape, all I can really say is they were two orange colored orbs. The flight pattern was indeed incredible. Something I've never seen before. I couldn't help but fix my eyes on to what was taking place. I didn't get scared however I had a incredible feeling of joy. But once the two crafts disappeared after about 3-4 minutes. I felt sort of depressed not knowing what to believe.;36.0901;-78.4517
