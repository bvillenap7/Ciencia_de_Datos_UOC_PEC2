Bright blinking rows of lights with a red light that changed position, hovering in the northern and northwest sky.;2007-10-08 23:55:00;almost 1 hour;Bright blinking rows of lights with a red light that changed position, hovering in the northern and northwest sky. We saw a bright blinking row of lights hovering in the northern sky, toward Havelock. Then we saw another of the same in the northwest sky. There was a red light blinking and it would move from the center of the row to the left, then back again to the center. It got closer for a short time, and the shape looked like a V shape. It was not close enough to distinguish the color of the craft. The one in the northwest sky moved after about 45 minutes, further north a short distance. Then the one closer began moving away slowly, but before I sat to type this, it was still in the sky. We live on the coast of the Newport River but these lights were inland. We saw them off of our back deck, with no house lights on or reflections from other lighting. Amazing.;34.7542000000001;-76.9069
