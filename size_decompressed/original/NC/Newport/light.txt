Moving object recorded  in sky;2010-08-14 03:20:00;20 min;Moving object recorded  in sky we laid out to see the meteor shower when we notice a very bright light that didn't move.  It was brighter then any star we have ever seen, which is what originally brought our attention to it.  After a while, it significantely dimmed in brightness, almost to the point of disappearing.  We then got our video camera out and although we couldn't see anything through the camera, when we later viewed the digital image we discovered alot of anomolies.  It moved very fast in multiple directions.  At one point during or filming, we noticed an orange light that zipped all over the area in no appearant pattern.  It left a trail behind it as it zipped through the sky, right up until the point where it completely disappeared.;34.7542000000001;-76.9069
