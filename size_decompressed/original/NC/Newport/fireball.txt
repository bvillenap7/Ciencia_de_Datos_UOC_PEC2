Bright Light and Sonic Booms;2002-05-12 21:00:00;1 min;Bright Light and Sonic Booms It looked like a  star, just it was moving slow.  It just about didn't catch my attention .  Then I thought to myself, Wow the Space Station. It was moving about the center of the sky from west to east.  The speed was the same as if there was an airplane at about 30,000 ft.  Real slow.  Then it got really bright.  I could not look at it it was so bright. I looked down toward the ground and noticed my shadow.  Then the light dimmed.  I looked up just in time to see it fade away. About 8 seconds later there was a low rumble (like a jet plane when reversing the engines), Then a loud boom. I felt it in my teeth it was so low frequency. I checked everywhere I could think of to see if there was a launch but found nothing for todays date. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar reports from same source.

Out of nowhere fireball appeared and disappeared.  Red/Orange in color.;2011-07-15 19:30:00;5 seconds;Out of nowhere fireball appeared and disappeared. Red/Orange in color. I was sitting on my deck around 7:30 pm talking to my employee and my son.  Out of nowhere behind them above the tree line a red/orange fireball appeared.  I said to my son and employee..What is that?   They both turned to witness the fireball only for it to just dissappear in a matter of seconds.   I have yet to see it again and to this day wonder what it could have been......it exploded and imploded.  Was quite strange!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.7542000000001;-76.9069
