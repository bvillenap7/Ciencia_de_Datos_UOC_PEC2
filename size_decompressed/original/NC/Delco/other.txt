Oddly shaped illuminated object in sky that drew attention of 6 helicopters two days before election.;2016-11-06 18:30:00;45 minute;Oddly shaped illuminated object in sky that drew attention of 6 helicopters two days before Election. On Sunday, for close to 45 minutes, an object was observed in the distance.  The top had a green light, and the bottom two sides had a white light.  It moved back and forth and bobbed up and down in a stationary position.  Within 30 minutes, 6 helicopters arrived high in the air, which caused it to move more rapidly up and down before moving away.  Eventually the helicopters disappeared, following it.  Afterwards, saw to streams of light fly in the direction after it and the helicopters, like it was 'shooting stars'. I watched this for the whole week of 11/6/16.  Saw the same on 11/7/16.  On 11/8 and 11/9, there was a lot of Light Pollution in that general direction. On 11/10, saw the same light in the sky when driving from work and watched it disappear in the sky within seconds. On 11/11, while I was not home, younger sibling, called, who had witnessed event on 11/6 and 11/7, reported to me he saw the same thing.  While driving on Highway 87,  I could see the light from a distance and could watch it move in the sky until it disappeared. On 11/12, I watched it for a full hour, until it disappeared completely in the sky. All sightings happened at the same time, after sunset, roughly around 16:30 (sic. 18:30 hrs.) (6:30pm), and ended around 17:10 (7:10pm) daily give or take a few minutes.  Ironically enough, this all happened this week, of the 2016 Presidential election.;34.2806;-78.2593
