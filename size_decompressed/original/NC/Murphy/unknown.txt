Moving lights with multiple strobing colors.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star.  PD));2006-03-26 01:33:00;1 hour plus;Moving lights with multiple strobing colors. At approximately 1:30 I was made aware of a light that was changing color in the sky by a person in the household that was trying to sleep it was fairly intense, at 1:33 am I ventured on the rear deck to get an unobscured view on it.  Over the course of 45 minutes we watch it change colors split into seperate light balls, saw the equivalent of small shooting stars coming from it, and watch flares come from the main light source and smaller round lights orbiting in a very random fashion.  At one point in time the light source split into the shape of a triangle in which the lights would literally move between each other.  At one point in time all the lights converged and dissappeared, instantly.  Approximately 3 minutes later, a new small light appeared from our point of view 2 inches up and 3/4th's of an inch over to the right.  At one point in time we saw what appeared to be an aircraft approaching, it then merged with the light.  Streaks of light were also observed.  Of the witnesses, one is a College Graduate majoring in Education, myself and a friend are Land Surveyors for a highly respected company in the southeast, and a child was present as well.  We all saw whatever it was and are extremely creeped out by what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Given the duration of the sighting, combined with the different colors the witness reports, we believe that a twinkling star would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the object was, in fact, a genuine UFO.
