Group of lighted objects at high speeds in Nags Head, NC;2000-07-29 23:15:00;1 hour;Group of lighted objects at high speeds in Nags Head, NC I am a professional classical musician, and I was playing a month-long gig on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, living in Nags Head, NC. On the last night of the gig, the four other musicians that I lived with and I were on our balcony talking and looking at the stars. After a few minutes, I noticed that a group of the stars out over the ocean were moving. I told my friends, and we began to watch them. Suddenly, the entire group came from a very long distance to a position directly over us. They had to have covered 20 miles in a matter of seconds, and then came to a stop. They then split into 3 groups-3,3,1, and began swirling in circles. Then they spread out across our field of vision in the sky, and came back together suddenly. They then went back out over the ocean and came back again, then turning immediately north, and disappeared up the coastline. We were not under the influence of any alcohol or drugs, and the neighbors in the house next door witnessed the exact same event. During their pause over us, we took out a camera with a telescopic lens, and a set of binoculars. The objects were very high up and their exact shape was indistinguishable, but they were definitely illuminated, the light was generated by them and not a reflection of some other light source. I have played this gig once more since that time, but we were housed in a different location, and I did not see them again in the times I went out to watch. This could not have been a plane or any other normal flying machine-the speeds, sudden directional chages and lack of noise would cancel out planes.;35.8862;-75.6027
