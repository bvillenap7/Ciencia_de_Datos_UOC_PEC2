They moved through the sky pretty fast, and then slowed down out over the water. The stopped, for a while, and then shot off towards the sky and were gone. It was the 4th of July of 1998, and i was outside waiting for my friends to come over to go to a party. Something caught the corner of my eye and i turned and saw three circular, blueish/white lights moving quickly through the sky approching the water, 2 or 300 yards away from me. I watched them moved very fast to the water and stop almost instanly. The floated there for around 15 minutes, staying perfectly still. Then, with no warning, a small ball, the size of a basketball maybe, it was too far away to tell. It hovered towards me at around 4-5 mph, and came to about 50 feet away from me, and then shot off towards the woods. Then as soon as the small ball dissapeared, so did the other three circles, moving extremely fast out in the same direction they came down. The next day i noticed my watch had stopped at 22:37 pm.;35.8862;-75.6027
Outer Banks is treated to spectacular star formations;2000-07-30 01:30:00;1hr. 30 minutes;Outer Banks is treated to spectacular star formations 10 balls of light resembling stars entered our field of vision around 1:00 Am EST. We had been watching quite a few shooting stars when a friend just stopped and said, Oh, my God. We all looked up and saw 10 stars moving together West-bound coming from the Atlantic Ocean at incredible speed. We all immediately saw them and began tracking them. they followed each other in a very tight group, and then suddenly burst into different directions. Several went below the light horizon for a while, but the others traced circular patterns in the sky. Thinkng they might be birds reflecting light, we broke out the binoculars and the telescope that we had, and through them we saw that they were too high and far to be birds, and that they were emitting their own light, not reflecting other light. They then rejoined and flew southward and disappeared. 10 minutes later they reappeared in the same place that they originally entered and broke into three groups-two groups of three and one group of four. They all traveled in a generally northern direction, but not all at the same time. after 15 more minutes of watching, only three were left visible. At 2:12 AM EST we retired for the evening having not seen them for a good 2o mibutes. i am curious as to if any other reports were made.;35.8862;-75.6027
Red light rapidly moving across sky before disappearing.;2014-06-26 23:25:00;30 seconds;Red light rapidly moving across sky before disappearing I was sitting on the beach, and was looking South towards a pier.  A red light, which I thought to be plane, slowly rose from the horizon.  The light was constant, and didn't blink. It moved toward a point that was directly above me, yet still very very far away.  It did this so quickly that it couldn't have been manmade.  The light instantly disappeared, and it was gone.

One red light, one green light, alturnatelyaacross in a perfect line, red...green....red ...green red green.  The lights were up high about 70 degrees.  They hung in the sky, then moved up, stayed there, 10 seconds, then down, exactly.  Sort of teasing me. Then, all, jump up, once, then jump up again, again, then up high then 180 degrees due west then.........gone.   That morning huge sonic boom, huge.  This at night you could hear a pin drop.  Red, green, red green, red green red green, circular lights, like on a plane, but not any noise.   I would swear all information to be true to my sight in court.  These were so precise in their movement whether to be local...no or whatever.  It was real what ever it was. Carol;35.8862;-75.6027
