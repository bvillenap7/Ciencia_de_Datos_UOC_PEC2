I was skateboarding in my neighborhood, there are fun hills to ride.  On my way home I got to the top of the hill and something caught my eye.  Straight in my line of site was a grey disc or oval shape, I couldn't tell because it was horizontal to the ground. It was darker grey on the top and bottom, slightly lighter grey in the middle.  It was just hovering but the reason it caught my eye was a diamond shaped cloud, very shimmery and all alone in the cloudless sky.  The disc was right next to the cloud and it looked like either the disc was taking in or expelling the cloud right into the leading edge of the disc.  I watched for about 20 seconds and I tried to get my phone out and camera turned on.  Right as I looked back up, it just disappeared, the cloud and everything.;35.8862;-75.6027
