Many star like objects in formation.;2014-06-07 23:14:00;10 minutes;Many star like objects in formation My 2 coworkers and I were taking out the garbage, one of them saw what appeared to be a constellation in the eastern sky.  I looked up and thought “wow, I have never seen that constellation before.” Upon looking closer we saw that the objects were moving.  They looked like stars, a few brighter than the rest and one being much bigger and square shaped.  They were moving from west to east, directly overhead.  The formation was about the size of the Big Dipper.   There were at least 30 objects, maybe even 60 and possibly more.  There were some flying backwards, some diagonal, but most were staying straight. I called my friend and he confirmed seeing them for a short time.  As soon as they were in the vicinity of the moon, we could no longer see them. During the sighting I tried to take a picture or video with my phone but that program was not working.;35.8862;-75.6027

There was 2 lights in the sky that duplicated into 4 and then duplicated in six and then dissipated into nothing.  The lights were white and made into a rectangular shape.  It made no noise and it happened within 5-7 seconds.;35.8862;-75.6027
