They called up to my room one night to come outside and see something.  I went downstairs and joined them outside, and saw a very large round object hovering closeby in the sky.  The outer perimeter was illuminated by lights(they might have been blue).  It hovered there for a bit then zoomed off at an extremely high rate of speed not seen by normal aircraft and disappeared.  A few minutes later, another one appeared, but this one was a bit further away.  The first one was almost directly over us.  I lived in the Kill Devil Hills section of this area, which might have been about milepost 9 or so.  The other interesting thing was the woman I lived with was holding her dog, a Yorkie terrier, and the dog looked in the direction of the craft and was growling, which was not normal behavior for the dog.  I was so excited the next day to watch the news as I was sure this event would be on it, but it was not.  I was terrified that night and did not sleep a wink. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
