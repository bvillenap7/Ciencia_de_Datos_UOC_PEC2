Silent Orange Orbs Moving From South To North Near Jennette's Pier (MP 16.5) Over the Beach in Nags Head.;2012-07-03 21:00:00;5-10 minutes;Silent Orange Orbs Moving From South To North Near Jennette's Pier (MP 16.5) Over the Beach in Nags Head My daughter and I were walking north on the beach in Nags Head near MP 14.5 and when we turned south to take a photo we saw an orange orb that seemed low in the sky moving slowly in a south to north direction parallel to the beach a bit out over the water. It appeared just beyond Jennette’s Pier, which is at MP 16.5, moved slowly north and before it moved directly over, still a bit south of us, it appeared to go out to sea and fade away. A minute or so later another one appeared and followed the same pattern. There were several more after that, always following the same pattern. This happened more than one evening. They were silent and did not seem to be “fiery” – just silent, orange orbs. I am not certain of the date, but know it was the first week of July very close to the 4th of July.  I actually called Jennette’s Pier to see if they knew anything about it or if it had originated with them, but the man I spoke to said he had no idea what I was talking about.  Since it was so close to July 4th, at first we assumed it was some kind of fireworks display, but that was not the case. The beach was very crowded in the evenings so I am sure there were other witnesses.  It was very striking as there was a full to almost-full blood red moon every night and it was quite clear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.8862;-75.6027
Orbs of light near Jeanette's Pier that vanished;2012-07-27 21:00:00;5 minutes;Orbs of light near Jeanette's Pier that vanished My husband and I were walking on the beach near Jeanette's Pier when we noticed two orange and red orbs moving quickly toward the pier.  One faded out before it reached the pier while the other went right above the end of the pier and then faded.  Very bizarre.   I know someone else on or around the pier had to see them.;35.8862;-75.6027
