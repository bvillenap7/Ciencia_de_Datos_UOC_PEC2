Low flying, lights, shooting lights.;1989-07-20 22:00:00;10 minutes;Low flying, lights, shooting lights. Walking along the road at the beach with a friend.  Saw a cluster of white lights in a patter (not sure how to describe it), it was VERY wide and very low, almost made a humming noise as it went along at a VERY slow speed, maybe 2 MPH.  It was travelling south along the beach road.  Ont he ocean side of the craft, a light swung out as if on an arm of some sort, the light then accellerated away in an easterly direction at a speed I canno describe.  It was a blur it went so fast.  The craft continued in a southerly direction for several minutes, the object then returned with the same alarming speed, docked and folded back into the craft.  We could only see lights, nothing else, pitch black, no moon or anything else.  I have no memory of what happened next, I woke up the next morning in my bed, my friend was in his bed as well.  We never talked about it again.;35.8862;-75.6027
