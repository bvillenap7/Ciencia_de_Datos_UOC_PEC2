I seen 3 planes flying in the sky in different places all w chemtrails but one of them had a swirvy trail at one point that i didnt see it make so i kept watching that plane to see it move like that again. All the sudden it took a sharp right and i wondered why, then a realy big silver shiny thing appeared near it out of no where.  There are no clouds and its a clear blue sky.  Out of no where it appeared within a second and flew fast and all around behind the plane, it sped to the front but disappeared underneath the left of the plane.  Then all the sudden it reappeared ahead of the plane and to the right.  Moving around as if it was checking the plane out.  Then it disappeared again.  The appearances and disappearances took about a full second.  They weren't instant.  The plane was a tiny spec w a huge wide chemtrail from each wing.  The ufo was a whole lot bigger than the plane it was like 10-15t! imes it size. Did anyone else see or report this bc im a firm believer.Â ;36.4257;-79.9571
