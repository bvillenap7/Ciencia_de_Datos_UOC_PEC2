They looked to be circular shaped and brightly glowing red, just hanging in the sky and not moving.  They were assembled in a staggered formation.  They hung in the sky for over 5 minutes.   My son and I were stunned.  As we were looking at them, a police officer pulled up and stopped to look as well.  We watched in amazement wondering what in the world could fill the sky with red lights like that.  After watching them about 5 minutes hang in the sky, one by one they each dropped down in the sky as if to land in a northwesterly direction, all moving in the same direction and then out of sight.   It was the strangest  thing I have ever seen.;34.9251000000003;-80.7278000000004

UFO in the sky turning white to red being chased.;2019-11-15 19:19:00;5 minutes;UFO in the sky turning white to red being chased. Driving down a county road at night I saw a flash of bright light go across the sky so fast and there seemed that there was something chasing it.  I told my daughter to film it since I was driving.  It danced back and forth in the sky and would turn from white to red.  I took pictures and filmed it.  All I can say it was for sure no plane.;34.9251000000003;-80.7278000000004
