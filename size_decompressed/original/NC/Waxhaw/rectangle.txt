Saw lights that appeared in the sky in a large rectangular shape.  For at least five minutes the lights were stationary but would fade out and become bright again, could not have been stars.  The lights faded out at different times.  Six individual lights were visible and were equidistant from each other.   They were eventually covered by a cloud so the exact duration of the event is unknown.  The lights were white.;34.9251000000003;-80.7278000000004
