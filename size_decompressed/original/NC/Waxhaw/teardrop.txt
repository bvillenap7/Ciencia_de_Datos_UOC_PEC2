May have been space junk?  Looked to be size of very large meteor.   Descent was slow:  5 seconds, before obstructed by trees on horizon.  No sound.  No reports on local community Facebook groups.  Very close to small corporate airport.  Planes seen in area.  Was weirdest thing.  Was I the only one?;34.9251000000003;-80.7278000000004
