I walked outside to take my dog out and it had a kindof loud wistling noise. I looked in the sky and saw it. It was huge, it was grey basicly all around and had a oval shaped door in the middle. I t had flashing rainbow colored lights on the bottom of it. My dog saw it and started barking and it took off at the speed of light. It looked like it just fanished into thin air. When it left all the trees started going back and forth of how fast it left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

((HOAX))  I witnessed an alien war over Waxhaw, NC.;2014-01-01 00:01:00;Still going on;I witnessed an alien war over Waxhaw NC MCP - Celebrating the New Year and thought I was just witnessing fireworks.  I saw a lot of explosions in the sky, but instead of colorful geometric formations, I kept seeing huge fireballs followed by mushroom clouds.  Apparently aliens were having a war in the atmosphere.  6-7 UFOs shaped like discs and piloted by Grays were shooting lasers and neutron missiles at each other at an altitude of 95,000 feet. It looked like the UFOs were blowing up when they were hit, but their shields protected them.  I saw one Gray eject from his spacecraft after several direct hits, but he parachuted into another craft then took off back into deep space.  The worst part was getting abducted.  A UFO landed in my driveway and the pilot got out and asked for several wooden boxes of uranium.  I told him I had some in my basement, and when he went and looked I snuck onto his spaceship and started going through his things.  He came back and caught me.  Things got really out of hand at this point and I'm too embarrassed to say what happened next.;34.9251000000003;-80.7278000000004
