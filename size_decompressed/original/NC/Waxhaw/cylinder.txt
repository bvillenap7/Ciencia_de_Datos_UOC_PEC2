Three Reddish Orange craft seen flying through Waxhaw,N.C..;2013-08-06 20:30:00;20-30 minutes;Three Redish Orange craft seen flying through Waxhaw,N.C. On the night of August 6th, my sister, brother-in-law and I witnessed 3 Reddish Orange cylindrical craft fly from South West to North East while standing in our connecting back yard.  The crafts though cylindrical seemed pointy on top.   The first one that passed and my sister and I were astounded.  She ran  into her house to get her husband and by the time he came outside it just vanished.  Not into the horizon mind you.  It just disappeared.   Just at that same moment my brother-in-law noticed two more coming from the South West heading North East.  Now my brother-in-law was a skeptic before this event.  For it was he ship spotted the other two coming.  All three flew over our back yards and there was no sound of any propulsion system.  Just dead silence.   As the last two passed we estimated that they were flying at helicopter height, but were five times the size.   As the last one passed over head we realized that there was what looked like a beam shining out of the center and that it was rotating around circumference the craft.   We continued to watch them travel North East until they just disappeared.  What I mean by disappeared is that they vanished before reaching the horizon line.  This was also witnessed by two of my neighbor's will have pictures.  I am awaiting an email of the photos now. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));34.9251000000003;-80.7278000000004
