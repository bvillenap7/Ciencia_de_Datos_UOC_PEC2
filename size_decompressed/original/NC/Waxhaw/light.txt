Slow travelling non-blinking light high in the sky that changed travel direction;2009-06-29 22:15:00;10 minutes;Slow travelling non-blinking light high in the sky that changed travel direction I saw a bright, non-blinking light very high in the sky.  The sky was pretty clear because the visible stars & constellations were very bright.  This light moved slowly from the North and then seemed to turn East and then reappear heading South.  The same light then reappeared again (I don't know at what time interval) heading South again at least two more times.;34.9251000000003;-80.7278000000004
2 green lights seen, and weird noise heard.;2018-08-15 20:00:00;4 minutes;2 green lights seen, and weird noise heard. Was checking on my animals and heard a strange noise.  I looked around to see what it was and assumed it was coming from the highway, but then looked to the sky and seen 2 flashing green lights passing overhead.   After a second of watching these lights move around the sky, the noise stopped and the lights started moving slower then stopped completely.  The lights were stationary in the sky for a moment, then slowly started rising and stopped and changed from green to red flashing lights, and then they started to flash between the colors and start moving away from my house, and then suddenly stopped.   The lights turned off and the ufo resembled a star in the sky (when the stars weren't even out yet) and it disappeared.;34.9251000000003;-80.7278000000004
Bright star like lights appear then get brighter and finally fade;2019-09-27 06:05:00;20 seconds;Bright star like lights appear then get brighter and finally fade Two Bright star like white lights appeared in sky as small as stars then increased in intensity. Much brighter than the other stars. Increased in brightness synchronized together and then faded out together about 20 secs later.  Not a cloud in the sky.  Objects did not move and were silent. Altitude appeared to be 30,000 feet or higher. Initially I thought I had witnessed two stars supernova together. But what are the chances of that occurring. I am very scientific person my career is electronics engineer. I saw a similar event about 3 months ago but it was a single point of light and occurred at night.  I am not sure what I saw. I have seen the international space station , meteor showers, but never anything like this.;34.9251000000003;-80.7278000000004
