Ufo attacked by jet;2004-02-18 07:00:00;8 min;Ufo attacked by jet It was daylight.  I glanced out the window and noticed the craft hovering over a large mountain.  It was oval shaped, and a dull gray color, but still shiny.   I watched for about 5 minutes, the grabbed some binoculars to get a closer look. I looked for about a minute and then I clearly saw a fighter jet (probably an F-15) circling around it, as if it wanted to shoot the craft down.   After that the craft slowly hovered up into the sky and out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
