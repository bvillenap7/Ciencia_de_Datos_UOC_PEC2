Fireball which looked like a large airplane engulfed in flames;2012-07-11 22:15:00;30 seconds;Fireball which looked like a large airplane engulfed in flames On Wednesday, July 11, 2012, at 10:15 pm (ET), I saw a large fireball cross the sky over Archdale, NC 27263.  I did not think of the word fireball until I viewed this website, but that pretty well describes what I saw.) It was moving from east to southwest about the speed of an airplane.  It looked like a commercial jetliner which was engulfed in flames. The nighttime sky was cloudy and the object never became hidden by the clouds.  It seemed just inside the clouds and never was hidden by the clouds.  It was a bright orange and flared at the top just like a large object on fire.   When it got almost out of sight, it seemed to “burn out.”  I saw it for about thirty seconds travel from one side of the sky to the other.   The object did not noticeably change altitude and when it “burned out,” I could not tell if it burned out, went behind the clouds, or simply went out of view from distance.  It seemed to turn more of a white color for about five seconds before it disappeared.   The whole time I was watching it from my deck, I believed I was seeing a large airplane on fire.
