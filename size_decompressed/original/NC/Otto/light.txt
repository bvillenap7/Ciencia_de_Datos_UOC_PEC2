Light in sky departs quickly.;2016-05-17 23:00:00;several minutes;light in sky departs quickly Object is bright light that is stationary in sky for several minutes. Bearing E.S.E over mountains as seen from U.S. highway 141, then departed rapidly southward.  Hard to determine speed, time from fixed position to disappeared, about two seconds.  Seemed to have an upward angle, but hard to tell as I am in the mountains.  Maybe I was traveling on a downward slope and it looked like it was going upward.  I was driving and had to keep on the road.   I was an owner/operator truck driver for over 20 years and I have seen many lights in the sky before, but not like this.;35.0552;-83.3833
