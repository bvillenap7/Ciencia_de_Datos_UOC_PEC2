Light in the sky that got brighter then disappeared.;2017-09-23 20:50:00;3 minutes;Light in the sky that got brighter then disappeared Standing outside, me and my fianc√© were talking waiting on kids to come home, when I saw a bright light moving.  I thought it was just another airplane, but I didn't hear any noise.  He hadn't yet seen it until I moved from the house looking in the sky.  We stood there watching it waiting to see the blinking lights of the plane which never showed up.   As it was moving at a good speed there was no noise just a bright light.  The light got bright as it got over head, we continued watching it and as it went over our house it faded to black.  I ran inside to tell Granny, he was still watching for it to see if he could see it.  It never showed back up and the was no airplane lights that blinked on it.;35.8729;-79.5821000000001
