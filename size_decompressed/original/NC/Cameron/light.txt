I notice it made no noise and was staying exactly still. After about 10 min. it moved directly over us and sat another 5 min. I was scared because I knew this was not swamp gas or any type of aircraft because it was to together and made no noise,and we where in the country 5 miles from a major highway and10 miles from a town.It then moved away from us and zig-zaged 4 times then went away in a twinkle of light.The zig-zag was fast and was perfectly shaped,about 45 degree turns with no curve so it could not have been a airplane.And when it dissappered it was like a burst of light like on star trek when they hit warp speed. That is my story and it will stay with me forever .I'm not sold on extra-trestrials but I can,t explain what I saw.;35.3106;-79.3472000000001
