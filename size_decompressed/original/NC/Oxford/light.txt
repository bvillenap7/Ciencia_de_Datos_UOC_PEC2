Bright lights 100 ft off the ground;2008-07-18 10:35:00;5 mins;Bright lights 100 ft off the ground I am entering this entry for my boyfriend.  I was on the phone with him when he stated that there was a large bright light about 100 ft off the ground over a field/large yard.  He said it looked like a plane with its landing lights on, but they seemed to be to close to be a plane. Also, as he rounded a corner the object was gone. He did stop and take a picture of it with his cell phone, this picture he sent to me. The light is a made up of two parallel lines going cross ways, the top line (in the photo) is about two times the size of the bottom one. He said that the lights were orbish until the photo when the orbs blurred into a line.;36.3325;-78.6155999999999
