Triangle UFO spins and splits;2002-04-12 18:00:00;2 minutes;Triangle UFO spins and splits Me and a group of friends were just driving around like we always do. We were on the country backroads when suddenly something appeared in the sky in front of us. we pulled off the side of road to watch what ever it was. it was about 55 degrees out side and a pretty clear night. the object had a dull reddish glow to it, making no noise at all.  the object appeared to be hovering in the sky, and then it began to slowly spin.  the spinning quickly increased untill it was moving so fast it looked like a blur.  then it stopped, just like that. but it appeared to have split into two objects. within seconds, both objects had bolted in different directions.
