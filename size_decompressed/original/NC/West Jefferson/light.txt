Shooting star with NO TAIL or UFO;2008-11-25 19:00:00;about a second;Shooting star with NO TAIL or UFO My boyfriend and I were driving down the road and both saw what we thought was a shooting star zip across the sky about 10inches (which would actually be hundreds of miles).   We both said Look at the same time, then both realized there was no tail.   Then the light just stopped and disappeared.    Well, about a second later a little red dot flashed in the sky exactly where the light stopped.  Now, my boyfriend is a small plane pilot, and he said there was NO WAY that what we saw could have been anykind of airplane or jet.  It moved too far too fast.   He said that he estimated the light to be about 10 miles above us.   The sky was pitch black and the sky was fairly clear, you could see several stars.;36.3752;-81.4893

Defitently not an aircraft or metor or shooting star.  I saw it driving home.  At first I thought it was a flare because it started assented upper warded then fell down.  Next it started the z type pattern.  Made the hair stand on the back of my neck.  I watched it in my mirrors until it was out of site.
