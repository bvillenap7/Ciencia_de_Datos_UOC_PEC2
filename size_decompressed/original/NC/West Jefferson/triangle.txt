High altitude triangle object with lighted corners seen over West Jefferson, NC.;2015-08-12 23:12:00;15 minutes;High altitude triangle object with lighted corners seen over West Jefferson, NC. I was working late at my computer and needed something from my truck, so I stepped out in the driveway to get it.  I then paused for moment and looked up at the sky, as I am always sky watching when I have the opportunity.  My field of vision was somewhat limited due to surrounding trees.   As I looked up I saw a star that was slightly brighter than the surrounding starts.  As I stared at it my eyes began to focus and a realized that it was rotating slightly.  It was a triangle with a white light on each tip and a red light in the center  It rotated both to the right and left but remained in a constant position.  I would guess its altitude to be near 40,000 feet.  There was no sound heard. As I watched I tried to see if there was any directional movement but could not see any.  I then picked three brighter stars as reference points and located the object slightly off center of the middle of the triangle.  I looked away for a while and looked back up to note that the object had moved from slightly off center to a position just inside the perimeter line between two of the reference stars.  I went out today, a day later, nearly the same time and could not see any objects within the reference triangle of stars. I would add one more unusual item.  While watching the object rotating in position I heard a buzz near me.  It sounded like a cell phone on vibrate or a fuel pump in a car.  After about five minutes I heard it again.  My cell phone was in the house and I had in my hand a fully discharged Ipod.  I could not tell where the sound came from.  I was standing next to a 2001 CRV which was near the direction of the sound.;36.3752;-81.4893
