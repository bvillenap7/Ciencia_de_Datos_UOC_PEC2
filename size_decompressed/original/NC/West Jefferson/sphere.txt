Eight orange glowing orbs in v formation visible for several nights at the same time.;1970-06-23 21:00:00;10-20 minutes;Eight orange glowing orbs in v formation visible for several nights at the same time. Around 1970, a relative of ours called and said we should come look at some strange objects he'd been seeing at night.  We went down and around 9 pm, approximately 8 glowing orange orbs passed overhead in a loose v formation.  They were soft orange in color, appeared spherical, and made no sound.  Their diameters were somewhat smaller than the full moon.  As they passed over us, the formation shifted slightly and one of them stopped overhead and hovered while the others went on.  We pointed a flashlight up toward it and flashed it on and off a few times.  It dimmed and brightened somewhat in what appeared to be a response. At this point we all freaked and got into the house.  The objects appeared nearly every night for about two weeks, and I have never seen anything like that since. My uncle, aunt, two cousins, my mom, stepdad, and I all witnessed this event.
