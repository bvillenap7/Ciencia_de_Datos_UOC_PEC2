I walked around the side of my house.  There was a huge craft hovering above their house.  I swear it did not make any noise.  No noise-like aircraft noise.  No engines, no lights.  It was a full moon and my parents lived out in the rural part of town.  I started yelling for my Dad to come out.  When I started yelling for him,  the thing took off so fast.  It was gone before I knew it.  It was a full moon, no clounds.  I have never seen anything like it since it happened.  I do know the difference between a aircraft, ballon(weather).  Helicopter.  This was something else entirely. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));34.8254;-78.0123
