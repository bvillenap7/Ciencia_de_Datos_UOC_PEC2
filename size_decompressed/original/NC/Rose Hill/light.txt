((Venus??));2020-03-20 20:00:00;0:00;Bright light that's been in the same area of the sky when there is no cloud overcast.  We first spotted it on the 20th of March. It's now the 9th of April and it's still there. From the pictures that we zoomed in on it has either a diamond or octagon looking shape. We also took video but it was hard to capture it with the light pollution from the houses.The second time I saw it I called the police they laughed it off and said It was kids probably playing with a drone. I stood on the porch and said out loud I'm calling the police and it disappeared. So when they arrived there was nothing to see. But drones don't hold a steady position and then disappear out of the sky after a few hours. All I know is it's still in the sky every clear night. Some said it might be a satellite but I've not known satellite's to come that low.;34.8254;-78.0123
