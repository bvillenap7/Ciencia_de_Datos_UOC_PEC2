Row of eight lights sighted over Dunn in Sampson County.;2013-02-27 22:30:00;20 minutes;Row of eight lights sighted over Dunn in Sampson County I was on my way home from Food Lion in Dunn.   I made a left onto Ira B Tart Road off of Rt 55.   As I was driving I seen a row of 8 lights in the sky that did not appear to be moving.  They seemed to be completely still except for the lights blinking.  They were blinking primarily white with intermitting red.  As I came around a bend and closer to my home, it was apparent that the lights were moving but very slowly.  Almost hovering and all blinking in synchronicity and moving at the same time and direction.   I pulled into the driveway and immediately got my husband to come outside to see what I was seeing.   The lights we moving extremely slow and then one by one blinking out of sight.  The last two of them were a lot slower and separate from the group and hovered over the trees next to the field by our house.   They began in a formation where it looked like one behind the other.  Both of the objects blinking in exact time with each other.  It was close but absolutely silent.   As they moved further from our house it actually looked like the lights were a part of something big. Meaning a light indicating the right and left side of something.  It was difficult to determine what shape it actually was.   What I found very unusual about this was that these final two lights/objects got to the same point of the other five and then immediately blinked out of sight just as the other five before them did.  I have never seen anything like this before in my life.  It scared me.;35.3144000000001;-78.6173999999996
