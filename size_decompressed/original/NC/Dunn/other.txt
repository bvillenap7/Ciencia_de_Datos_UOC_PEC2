As we were travering from Raleigh to Dunn NC I spotted odd looking lights in the sky. There were also airplanes in the sky since we were close to the air port. These lights seemed to be moving as if this was one object. They were very bright blueish/white lights. First there were 6-7 lights all looked the same brightness, same color, etc. We lost it as we got onto an area with trees etc. but when the sky became visiable again they were still there. they seemed to be about a mile away, and seemed to be going in the same direction that we were. We lose them again and did not see them any more while in the car. After we had been home approx. 20 min. I looked out at the sky toward Raleigh, the direction that we had come from. There the lights were. It was only three lights this time. it seemed to be slowing turning and heading back toward the north west. The lights seemed to be stationary on an object. If this was a solid object. from the distance it was from us it would have been 100ftx100ftx100ftx it appeared the size if eraser on a pencil. a this was about a mile away. flying very low in the sky. This was not a star because it was moving. I don't believe it was a plane. I have never seem those kind of lights on any plane. The lights were not blinking or any thing they (glowed) steady, without fading in and out.;35.3144000000001;-78.6173999999996
