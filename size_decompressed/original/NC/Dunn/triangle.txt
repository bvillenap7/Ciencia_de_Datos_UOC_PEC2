Triangle shaped craft seen;2006-12-14 19:30:00;10 minutes;Triangle shaped craft seen On December 14th at approximatly 7:30 pm I caught a reflection out of the corner of my eye over a field and saw a triangle shaped aircraft hovering.The craft was a good distance away but not enough to be mistaken for something else.It appeared to be almost transparent but yet you could easily make out the shape.And there were some lights on the 3 corners but they were not like conventional lights.Being around Christmas time a good way to explaine the lights is that they looked more like they were glitter and reflecting light...Hard to explaine.At first it took me a moment to register what I was seeing.My partner was baffled at the object and went inside the house.I stood out and watched it hover with a slow rotation and move slightly from left to right and make a diping motion from time to time for about 10 minutes when all of a sudden it just disapeared all together. The weather out was a nice partly cloudy night but there were no clouds in the area of the craft when seen.Not to sure what to think other than this thing was not like anything I have ever witnessed.Very strange indeed.;35.3144000000001;-78.6173999999996
Triangular UFO's seen in Dunn, NC on  07/29/2011;2011-07-29 22:50:00;15 sec;Triangular UFO's seen in Dunn, NC on  07/29/2011 On Friday, July 29, 2011, at approximately 10:30pm, I opened my front door to let my 2 dogs outside. Just above the top of the pine trees I saw a black/dark triangular shaped craft with lights at each point (mainly white [constant] with blinking red and occasionally green) and larger [constant], amber in the center. There were other identical light configurations farther ahead of this one but I focused only on this closest one. It was traveling very slowly NW and made absolutely no sound. I stepped outside and listened. After observing it for10-15 seconds the object moved from ‘a clear viewpoint’ to behind one of the pine tree tops. I came back in the door and ran over to my kitchen window, hoping to have a better view of the object emerging from the obscuring tree but I never saw the craft emerge. I then ran back to the door and stepped out onto the front porch but the object was nowhere to be seen. I looked all over the sky above/around me for another 2! 0-30 seconds, saw nothing, and then went back inside. We live in a well used flight path from Ft. Bragg and see and hear many types of aircraft. We have even heard (barely) some of the newer sound dampening helicopters and jet aircraft go over the house. This was nothing like any of these. The next day my husband and I went to the local grocery store and, as our groceries were being checked out, I overheard the bag boy telling the cashier about ‘the UFO’s he and his Dad had seen last night.’ He said that his Dad had been in the front yard and saw them and called for him to come out into the yard so he could see them, too which he did. They saw 3 identical, triangle-shaped black craft. He said that their house is ‘in the country’ with clear views and no stores or traffic noise. We both agreed to be watching the local paper for news of the event, wondering who else might have seen this. Sadly, there was never any news reported about the incident.;35.3144000000001;-78.6173999999996
