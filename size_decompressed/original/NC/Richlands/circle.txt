UFO with green circulating lights Monday night by Meadowview Elem. in Richlands around 2200!;2016-04-11 22:00:00;3 minutes;UFO with green circulating lights Monday night by Meadowview Elem. in Richlands around 2200! Between the hours of 2130 and 2200, me and my 10 yr old daughter were driving home on Pony Farm Rd and as we were turning past the school she noticed some lights in the sky, and said mommy I'm scared, it's an ufo in the sky!  As I looked up and saw one or two ufo with several lights that were green and rotating in a circular motion like the number 8 or figure 8! When looking at it our vision went blurry and doubled and felt like we had our eyes dilated and could barely see!  I tried to get pictures or a video of it but I couldn't see or find my phone...we were too scared to sit there so we turned at our street since we were right there and as we left my vision got better, but it was blurry until the next day!   Everytime we go past there we look up in the sky.  My daughter is now scared to go anywhere at night because we know that it was an ufo!
