Bright single white light on a summer night sky in eastern N.C.;1996-06-01 20:30:00;00:03:00;Bright single white light on a summer night sky in eastern N.C. I was at a friends house in the neighborhood I was living in. There was about five of us in a small children's pool in her backyard. I remember the time of night because at 20:00 my dad would always call us in for dinner, and maybe 30 minutes later would actually come out and get us. We were in the water and I heard my dad call us, but we continued playing anyway. I got out from under a pan we were playing with when I looked up towards the sky. When I looked up I saw a white light that was moving slowly from the right side of the sky. I continued watching it trying to figure out what it was because it was only one light, which I knew wasn't a plane, and it was also moving faster than a satellite would be plus it was much brighter. While I was watching this object I noticed that it had stopped moving almost as if it realized I was watching it. While this object was motionless I decided to get one of the others to look at the sky to see if they saw it as well. When I finally got them to look at the sky the object then did a zig-zag pattern kind of in up and outward way like what would happen  in a generated image, but as it was doing this pattern it was leaving behind a trail of light behind it. When the light was completely faded is when my dad showed up. I have only told two other people of this incident, the first being my dad who has since passed, and the other told me to report it to this site even though it had occurred many years ago.
