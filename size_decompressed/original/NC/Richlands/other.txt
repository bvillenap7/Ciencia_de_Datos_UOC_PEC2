((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  The witness describes a very peculiar phenomenon, which is not at all well understood by astronomers.  The object described may have been a meteor, in which case, a person on the ground should not have been able to hear it, given its presumed altitude, and given that it was almost certainly traveling at hyper-sonic velocity.  Witnesses on the ground, if they hear a meteor at all, sound hear a sonic boom, like a clap of thunder, but they should not hear a zzzzzz sound.  Please see a similar report from Roswell, NM, for an earlier date.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.8611;-77.5885
