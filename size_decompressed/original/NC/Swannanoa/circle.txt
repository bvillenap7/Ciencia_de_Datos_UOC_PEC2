I was driving to my house in my car down a country road and noticed 2 crafts with red and yellow lights flying in a meandering fashion up in the sky. When I arrived at my house, I had my spouse come outside to look. At this point there were three of them and they were higher in the sky. Two of them disappeared, and then a second later reappeared at a different spot in the sky. It seemed impossible for them to have traversed that distance at the speed they were going. They eventually drifted out of sight.;35.6179;-82.4026
