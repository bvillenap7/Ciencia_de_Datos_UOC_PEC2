Mother and children witness dome-shaped object with lights ascending from the ground and hovering overhead;1975-10-15 19:00:00;15 minutes;Mother and children witness dome-shaped object with lights ascending from the ground and hovering overhead i had young children and had picked up a neighbor's child to spend the night.  After coming up our drive, I stopped my volkswagen so the children could look at the stars for a few minutes. (Our home is surrounded by woods and ascends into a mountain.) As I reached for my keys in the switch and turned my lights on, the dome-shaped object came up from out of our woods.  It started ascending and as it ascended, lights started going around the sides of the craft.  The higher it climbed it seemed the faster the lights would go.  I can remember red, white and green lights. I was so shocked, that I just sat there in the road. It hovered for a few minutes over a hickory tree which was alongside of our drive.  I wouldn't get out of my car, but I asked my oldest son (who was 12 years of age, where the object was and he said it was just stationary over our car. It just ascended calmly until it was out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.6179;-82.4026
