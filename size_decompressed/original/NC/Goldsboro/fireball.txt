I saw 4 balls of fire floating through the night sky;2011-11-01 21:00:00;about 30 seconds;I saw 4 balls of fire floating through the night sky My daughter and I were on our way home. I was driving in my car.  I saw these things that looked like balls of fire. It was sprinkling a little bit so maybe it wasn't but it sure looked like it.  I only saw three at first they were in a triangle like shape.  They didn't stay that way though.  As they were floating(I say that because they were moving very slowly as if the wind were just carrying them)two of them started floating in and out of each other as if they were racing.  Then out the corner of my eye I see another one.  It was nowhere near the other three. I tried to take a pic. on my cell phone but I was driving in bad weather conditions at night and what i got looked like a fake or like a street light.  Either way it was no good.I called my husband and told him about what I had just seen. Ive looked on the internet to see if anybody else saw them that night or if anybody anywhere has seen the same thing. Ive looked at some pics. but have seen none that look like what I had seen.  I know what I saw and I believe what I saw was something out of this world and my husband also believes that I seen something strange that night. bright flash in bellingham area. A flash of light lit my whole house.  My dog freaked out.  At the same time a friend who lives 15 miles away witnessed this same light and his dog freaked out aswell.   I was wondering if anyone else noticed this.  I have never seen a UFO and don't nessasarly beleive in them, but I can not think of another explaination.  My girlfriend has witnessed a similar occurance.  Winter lighting??? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
