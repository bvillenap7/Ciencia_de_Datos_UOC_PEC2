1997 rotating stars positioned to left and right of moon do fast clockwise rotations;1997-07-15 23:00:00;20 mins;1997 rotating stars positioned to left and right of moon do fast clockwise rotations I was on hwy 70 west one summer in 97 I was traveling back to my current home in Pikeville and just had gotten a mcdonalds big mac after work, It was a clean night and decided to look up at the moon. That is when I seen 2 star like objects white light as of a star Which I thought it was a star at first and also thought it was a bit strange that one was to the left of the moon and the other to the exact right. They were brighter than normal stars I thought so I observed them just because it was cool. Then I noticed they appeared to do a clockwise rotation very quickly around the moon back to there places they were at. I thought at this point that I must be seeing things so I pulled over off the exit to William st off 70 west and sat in my pickup truck bed. The stars kept doing the same rotation and it was very fast and I know that that is not normal. So After seeing this I needed a witness so I rushed home to pikeville to inform my roomate of this and in the 20 min it took to get home they stopped and dissapeared. I did not see them dissapear it is almost like they dimmed and blended back in with the regular stars. Between all this and the ghosts I have bumped into the past 7 years I am starting to open up to the fact that some strange stuff is going on.;35.3657373737373;-78.0628252525249
strange lights in NC;1998-01-21 22:00:00;10+ minutes;strange lights in NC While travelling back from pittsburgh on I-95 just north of truckstop road, I noticed a light formation on the horizon to the east. The lights were green, white, and blue and were in an arch from horizon to horizon, evenly spaced and didnt seem to move up or down, just east to west. We pulled the car over into the breakdown lane to observe the lights. As they passed overhead there was no sound, and I couldnt make out any shape of a craft, as they seemed pretty high up. After they passed over us we got back into the car and continued driving down the highway. The color of the lights had changed to red, and they seemed to have doubled. They coninued to move west until the lights faded out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.3657373737373;-78.0628252525249
3 ufos flying in a Triangle formation.;2014-05-18 21:45:00;3 minutes;3 ufos flying in a Triangle formation Noticed a craft flying west to east and it was one light in the night sky blinking rapidly changing from red to orange, as the craft flew it changed directions and started to fly north.  I then notice another craft trailing behind.  This other craft was blinking just like the first one. Then I noticed a 3rd craft out in the distance.   All 3 ufos created a perfect triangle formation with about 1/2 a mile distance between crafts.   As the crafts kept flying the first UFO stoped blinking and then became a solid orange color for about 30 seconds or so. The it just flew into the distance.
