Two oval shaped objects fly over Goldsboro, NC;2011-11-20 19:26:00;4 seconds;Two oval shaped objects fly over Goldsboro, NC It was dark outside with the sun just over the horizon.  As I walked my dog down the road I my neighborhood, I spotted two very bright lights travelling perfectly parallel to each other at high speeds, faster than any aircraft.  I watched them travel south west for about four seconds until they disappeared.   They just vanished in the air, not into clouds or over the trees.   They were about as bright as the planet Jupiter.  They didnâ€™t leave any trails or make a noise.  A Street light switched off when they vanished but turned back on after a few seconds.
