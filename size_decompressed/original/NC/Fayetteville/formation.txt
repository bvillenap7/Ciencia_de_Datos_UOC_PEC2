But as it fell the object broke into 5 pieces & stopped falling all at the same time.   This took about 1.5 minutes to take place & then they hovered for almost 50 seconds & I couldnâ€™t see them anymore due to a tree line.

We both witnessed several lights appear in the night sky at once. Strangely, the lights were moving left to right, down then up, as well as disappear then randomly reappear in strange formations. At times they would stop and stay in place and then suddenly move into perfect lines/shapes/etc. No sound accompanied the lights and total were visually consistent for around 7 minutes. Then all together they disappeared. Definitely not an aircraft although we did see an aircraft after the fact with searching lights and moving super slow and appeared to be in search.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
