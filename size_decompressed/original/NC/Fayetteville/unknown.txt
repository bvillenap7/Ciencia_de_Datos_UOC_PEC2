report in north carolina and a similar report  in  south carolina;2000-08-21 00:00:00;about    a minute;report in north carolina and a similar report  in  south carolina I was on the phone talking to my girlfriend  and  i had look out the window, to see if there was something out side. and i looked up   and saw a  bright light i couldnt make out the object or what ever it was. but i know for a fact it seem pretty advance to travel  fast and then slow down and stop then speed up and slow down again. it stayed bright for about 30 seconds. and when it was bright it was moving pretty damn fast. and my house is positions north and it was about  4 degrees north or so. it was around  10:40 or 11  something or so but  it was heading at a fast speed and then it just disappeared. but it more of   faded out like a star or something or a light dimiming or something and  while it was  dimming it slowed down and after that i didnt see anything else . i told my  girlfriend when i was on the phone and she said that  maybe the secret base near by  may be doing some kind of test flight  or something i didnt hear anything that night  and  it didnt make a sound . there are 2 military bases near by     one  everyone knows  and one    is secret. but  my mom told me that someone  else had reported a bright light not to far from  our house  and that sighting was in 1997.   and also my grand uncle had the same incident before  just like what i saw and my mom told me his whole story. but his sighting was in south carolina near manning and summerton. and when he saw the light he pulled his truck over and got out and look at it. and my mom said when he told her  when the light came close it   had   got  too close to where his truck was so he  started the truck up and  tryed to get to my grandpa's house and  the light followed him  closer and closer.and when my  granduncle made it to my grandpa's house  he jump in the bushes near the porch and my grandpa came out the door and  he saw the light also but  it faded like a start before he could of goten a good look at it. my granduncle told my grandpa everything and my grandma thought  he was lying b/c he was drunk but my grandpa  saw the light   but ! didnt  g et a good look. my grandpa believes my granduncle b/c when every he see something he's not going to lie about it   and plus when  or when he ever gets drunk he talks about  all the things that happens but  he didnt barely drink anything  at that time  he wasnt even tipsy. my mom told me every thing that happen that night and she was listening to everything. but anyway i'm 16 and  i believe that theres something going on out there. next time i'm going to have a camcorder ready;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
5-6 tiny multi-colored changing objects flying perpendicular and parallel to each other in close proximity;2002-01-22 20:23:00;10-12 minutes;5-6 tiny multi-colored changing objects flying perpendicular and parallel to each other in close proximity Around 8:23pm, my grandmother called me in a frantic tone.  She asked me to go outside and look in the sky.  I (being in a tank top and shorts in 30 degree weather hurried up, walked on the porch and looked up at the sky. That’s when I observed multiple small objects in the sky that were flying relatively close together (way too close to be an airplane or any other object used as travel) and were rapidly changing colors (red/green/yellow or white). Unsure that I was actually was witnessing some weird phenomena I went back inside to put on sweatpants and a hoodie and immediately returned back out side. To my amazement the object were still in the sky, And flying perpendicular and parallel to each other (5 I counted at the time). Still thinking these were probably satellites or small airplanes I continued to watch the objects fly close to each other to see any different movements an airplane would or would not do. That’s when I observed 2 objects that were currently flying perpendicular to the other STOP in mid flight and allowed the 2nd object to fly across (as to avoid a crash) and then it continued moving again. I was so mesmerized that I thought it imperative to record it on my iPhone 11 however, when I pressed record, held my phone up to the night sky and zoomed in... you could not see the objects on my phone.... I left my phone in my hand and pointed towards the sky as I looked up to see if they objects had disappeared and they were still there. Somehow my phone would not or could not capture the objects. After sometime the objects seemed to have fizzled out or disappeared more so than flew away.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
Brilliant amber light in sky near Fayetteville NC;2008-01-22 05:00:00;10 minutes;Brilliant amber light in sky near Fayetteville NC I was driving on 295 headed east toward I95. I drive this road every week on either Monday or Tuesday on my way to work in Washington DC in the early Am hours. I saw an unexplained, very bright light in the sky slightly southeast of my location as I headed east. When I exited the 295 to head north on I95, the light was still sitting there and was several miles east of the BP gas station visible from the entrance ramp to I95 It never moved it just sat there shining really bright. I drive that route every week like I stated and I have never seen that bright light before or since.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
Vertical object with red strobes moved in the northern sky from west to east.;2013-12-16 05:40:00;1 minute;Vertical object with red strobes moved in the northern sky from west to east. We were outside trying to observe the ISS in the NW sky - did not see it but suddenly in the N sky about 40 degrees above the horizon we saw an object that was apparently vertical, red blinking strobes (back and forth, top then bottom, rapid succession, 6 times per second roughly?) - moved from west to east.  It appeared very large, but must have been enormous as it disappeared over the horizon in the NE sky.  The lower light appeared at about 30 degrees above, the uppermost light was at more than 45 degrees above horizon.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
Flashing from a possible satellite tumbling on its arc.;2019-06-21 22:45:00;5 minutes;Flashing from a possible satellite tumbling on its arc. Took my dog out for his last night potty run about 10:45 pm tonight.  I always look up at the stars at night as it was something Dad and I used to do when I was growing up.  He was an engineer, designing early communication satellites, and I know quite a few of his designs are above us, circling the Earth.  Dad taught me how to identify a planet as opposed to a star, and how to track the satellites when they go overhead. Tonight, I caught a glimpse of a flash of white light out of the corner of my eye traveling from the west to the east/southeast sky above the star Altair (used my Sky Guide app to figure its location), then dismissed it as I thought it was a light of an airplane high overhead.  We are under the flight lines for our local airport and the nearby military base.  I looked to the south and then back over where I saw the light and saw a smaller glimmer of it.  Continued watching that area of the sky and it flashed again and again, somewhat in a predictive sequence about 2-3 seconds in between each flash and the duration of the flash was a fraction of a second which made it very hard to predict where it was going.  When it flashed again, this time it was like a streamer flying in the wind with a 1-2 second duration and then it disappeared, only to quickly flash again a few more times before the light dimmed out of sight. I do not believe it is a UFO craft.  I believe I saw a satellite which may have been knocked so it's spinning while in orbit and caught the sun reflecting off its solar panels (the flashing light) instead of a steady glow which moves in an arc across the night sky.  The flashing light was still traveling as if it were following a satellite arc, that's how I could guess where to look when I realized it wasn't an airplane flying overhead.    Just wondered if anyone else had seen the same thing tonight.  Pretty interesting!;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
