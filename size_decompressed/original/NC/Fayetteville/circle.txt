UFO observed in front of the Moon during FULL Lunar Eclipse 20 February 2008 in Fayetteville, NC;2008-02-20 22:40:00;5 seconds;UFO observed in front of the Moon during FULL Lunar Eclipse 20 February 2008 in Fayetteville, NC Approximately 22:40 EST, 20 February 2008, at XXXX ((deleted)) Drive, Fayetteville, NC 28311, I was observing the lunar eclipse that began about 22:30 EST. From my position in North Carolina, the moon was in full lunar eclipse weather was ideal- clear blue and 22 as we say in aviation the moon was approximately 55 degrees South/ Southwest overhead- in other words, I had a clear unobstructed view of the lunar eclipse from my position on my front porch in Fayetteville, NC. I normally wouldn't be looking at the moon except this Lunar Eclipse event had been widely publicized on TV that evening. I was enjoying an event with unobstructed view that few will ever witness in their life time. Approximately 10 minutes into the full lunar eclipse, about 22:40 EST, I noticed on the left side of the moon (as I was facing it), a very bright, round object resembling a satellite a bright pin-point of light object clearly not a naturally formed object appeared suddenly, traveling in a straight line from the left side of the back side of the moon- it was clearly traveling in a straight line towards Earth. In about one to two seconds, the object made a 90 degree turn to my right, directly in front of the face of the fully eclipsed moon.  As quick as it appeared and shot across in front of my unobstructed view of the eclipsed moon, it disappeared off to my right side of the Moon and became invisible almost immediately of passing out of the Umbra shadow of the Earth eclipse of the Moon.  The entire event was less than 5 seconds. I am a US Army trained combat helicopter pilot, Desert Storm veteran of the Gulf War.  I'm accustomed and trained to look for things, especially at night.  This was not a naturally occurring object. This object made intelligent turns and in relation to the position of the moon, was traveling at as fantastic rate of speed. I am not a UFO nut.  You may even call me skeptical.  I have been able to observe a great deal of objects while flying with night vision goggles at night in various parts of the world.  I have witnessed many naturally occurring and man-made events in the sky normally not seen with the naked eye.  But this object appeared from the back-side of the moon with my un-aided view and flew directly across in front of the moon was of intelligent design and flight path.  It probably would not have been visible during the lighted or visible, not eclipsed, moon, by an un-aided human eye.  But during the eclipsed darkened view of the Moon, it was so clearly visible to the naked human eye!   I truly believe the object I observed was not of natural origin but of intelligent origin.  I am capable of distinguishing the difference between a circular type orbit versus a straight flight path.  This object was of the latter. And I know of no known human-made objects that could have produced such incredible speeds and turns based upon its observed position that night from the back side of the moon, making an instant 90 degree right turn in front and across the eclipsed moon that night. By the way, I was 47 years old at the time of the lunar eclipse and my eye sight has been evaluated as 20/12 & 20/15 in each eye during every one of my US Army Flight Physical Evaluations for the past 20 years.   I honestly believe I witnessed an intelligently driven object not of man-made origin.  I have reluctantly not reported this event to anyone before now because it was so incredible to believe myself.  And I do not want to be labeled a UFO Nut.  But I witnessed, regardless of scrutiny, a truly incredible event that evening on 20 February 2008 during the Lunar Eclipse.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287

As I was waiting for it to continue I noticed 3 orbs of light outside my window about 3-4 feet off the ground and 30 feet away.  The light orbs were moving slowly back and forth, up and down. I got up and went to the window to investigate.  I can clearly see them now, no backgrounds light, no people in the area.  As I was watching the they formed into a line and slowly moved away to the left and disappeared behind 2 vehicles.  I was completely stunned and blown away,  I wasn't really scared but more scared because I couldn't explain the lights.  Several minutes later i seen 2 cats and a dog walking the same area as the lights.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287

Saw several circular or ball-shaped objects which appeared to be stacking up on each other and moving together.
