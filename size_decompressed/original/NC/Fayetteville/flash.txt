Orange flashing craft.;2015-05-25 03:40:00;15 minutes;Orange flashing craft. Ok, I was outside just smoking a cigarette, when out of my preferral (sic.  peripheral), I saw this bright flash of light, so naturally it caught my attention and at the time nothIng was there.  Then, next thing I know, about 10-15 seconds after the flash, this little orangish red (more orange than red) light started to appear and it was getting brighter and brighter, and bigger and bigger.  It got so bright it just FLASHED, and then disappeared. I kept watching and it would do this every 15-20 seconds traveling west to east.  I watched this for about 15 minutes.  It seemed like the light would build up to maximum potential and then just flash then dissapear.   Also, the brightness of the flashes would vary, but still very bright.  At one point the flash got so bright I could see that it looked as if though the lIght was coming from the inside because I could see very distinct black spots which I assumed were the spaces between windows and I could see 4 windows that the light was emminating (sic.  emanating) from.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
Unknown jerky flying red and blue flashing object seen high in the sky.;2016-07-20 04:23:00;20 minutes;Unknown jerky flying red and blue flashing object seen high in the sky. A red and blue flashing light seen, thought at first to be a plane, but it moved in jerky motions.  The object would travel forward a short distance, then move up and down, taking an abrupt sideways movement.  It reminded me of how a bumblebee moves from flower to flower, then hovers staying within a certain zone.  It would continuously move in the same type pattern.  You could see a small trail behind it as it moved about.  I watched for a while before going back to bed.   In order to have a witness, I woke up my 18 year old son.  He and I both looked at it together before I went back to my room to watch it some more.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
