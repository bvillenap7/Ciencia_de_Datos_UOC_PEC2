Other witness remembers nothing.  Tractor beam taking water aboard craft.  5 miles downrange, appeared 300 feet long and 60 feet in diameter.  Based on angle at tree top level, and known range, object was around 6600 feet long and 550 feet in diameter.  Many other events, one involving screen memory. Ship was dull orange on sides, bottom was brilliant white with a blue beam of light amidships.  I saw the craft on Pamalee Drive hovering just behind Highland Nursing Home.  Craft was long and cylindrical, with a disk in front that was the full diameter, and a forth as high.  I could send you a drawing if you like as it is very difficult to visualize.  The man that was with me recalls nothing of the event, while I remember seeing it for about ten to fifteen minutes.  I was not afraid of this craft, though I knew in my heart it was from another world.  The bottom of the craft was flat, the top a half circle, and the back when it took off was flat with what appeared to be cargo doors.  When the craft took off, it slowly gained altitude and moved forward, much like a helicopter.  After this slow ascent, it moved so fast that it was on the outer fringes of the earths atmosphere in less than a second, spewing out long streaks of white light behind it.  My friend is a recovering alcoholic, and has no memory of the incident.  I recall that when we returned to his house, our watches were both 50 minutes slow.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
White, Glowing Cylinder, Maybe affected my mind temporarily;1995-03-20 00:00:00;5 min;White, Glowing Cylinder, Maybe affected my mind temporarily Me and my friend were camping in the woods in Gray's Creek off of School RD. at Dr. Virgil's pond. We were woke up by a bright light, not blinking but all encompasing. There was no sound or vibration, and we were not afraid at all. We did not open our tent  and actually see what it was for a minute. When I opened the tent I saw a massive cylindrical object floating in the air over the pond. I zipped the tent and my friend and I fell back asleep. This thing had to have had some kind of psycotic (sic) powers or something, because I thought about it the next day and my friend and I agreed that we should have ran but we both fealt a surreal comfort during the sighting. I have always pushed this memory away, but I am more and more intrigued and everyday I catch myself staring at the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
