Unearthly craft over Fayetteville/ Lumberton NC area.;2012-12-21 20:30:00;2 minutes;Unearthly craft over Fayetteville/ Lumberton NC area. To start off, both the passenger and I who witnessed the craft are members of the USAF and know characteristics of aircraft.  I work around them everyday. While traveling down I-95 about 15 miles outside of Lumberton NC,  My passenger and I witnessed a long formation of white lights above horizon. Jokingly, we talked about an aircraft landing on the highway.   As we drew closer, the line of lights made me certain that these were no landing lights of any aircraft I have encountered.  As we traveled ever closer the lights formed into somewhat of a cross/disc shape with a bright light in each corner.  A single unflashing red light accompanied the center light.  The craft was angelic in its movements and seemed to hover at a speed at which no aircraft could maintain flight.  I would estimate its altitude at 200 feet.  I could make out the feint curvature of a hull between the lights. No sound was heard when I rolled down my windows.  At this point my passenger and I couldn't comprehend what we had just seen.  The craft passed over to the trees on the right of the interstate. I knew i needed to photograph the craft so I immediately took the exit a quarter mile from our sighting, but the craft was nowhere to be seen.  I know there were other witnesses.   I consider myself an extremely logical person but have no explanation for what was seen.  It maneuvered in a manner no earthly vessel can. The fact I witnessed this on the supposed end of the world might bring discredit to my story, but I know what I saw.  After finding this site, I noted a similar account of a craft in this area very recently.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
