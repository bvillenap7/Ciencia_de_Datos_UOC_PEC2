I was awakened by an eerie sound on the cold January night. I noticed a bright light coming from the back sliding glass window.... I made my way to the window and the I noticed the bright light was coming from the sky. I walked from the window to the front porch of double-wide trailer and I started to feel a light vibration throughout my mobile home. My daughter was awakened by the trembles of her bed.... she ran to me crying. I told her to go back to bed  and she did. I stayed up for atleast three more hours and I watched the light move closeer and then move further into the night sky. It was as if it was on fire.. maybe a burning airplane, I thought. But no it would have landed by now. It just floated there........... The longer I sat there , the more I became fascinated with it. Before I knew it I could see the sun rising in the distance. A light sent from the fireball shaoped ship blinded me and it was gone as the sun finally showed its face through the pink clouds. It was over and I did not know whether to tell someone or not, what would they think? Probably that i was a nut and had dreamed it all. But let me assure you, this was no dream...... it was so real.An experience that I will never forget.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287

Orange-red fireball near Fort Bragg.;2004-04-09 21:10:00;5 seconds;Orange-red fireball near Fort Bragg. I was outside in my front yard looking at stars in a clear sky. I am 37 Yrs. old. I saw a small blinking light the size of a star almost directly overhead that I knew was a plane. About 1Min. behind it was another plane. They were traveling N/NE. This is normal because I live 15Min. from Fayetteville Regional Airport and 25Min. from Fort Braggs front gate. I am used to seeing planes of all types. As are most people that live here. Suddenly under the first plane flew a orange-red fireball from out of nowhere. It left a trail like a meteor. It was the size to me of a dime at arms length. It was traveling opposite the planes (S/SW.) From the direction of Fort Bragg. The fireball passed the first plane and vanished. I figured it was a meteor. Then it reappeared and passed under the second plane and vanished again. I waited and it reappeared again and vanished. It traveled like a stone skipping on water except the stone would be vanishing every time it hit the water. It did this a total of five times and was gone almost making the horizon. This event happened at 21:10 in the evening. The object went from directly over head to the horizon in less than 5 Seconds. It was obviously in a hurry. There was no sound. The planes did not change direction afterward.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
