I am pretty sure it was June 25 (Monday).  All of a sudden I saw this large ball of blue light emerge just above the tree line and zip across the highway. It had a smaller blue light at the very end of it  - I would say both lights were more at the tips of the craft rather than on the underside of it. I also noticed vertical grooves (evenly spaced) on it as it neared the other side of the highway before disappearing over the trees. I am assuming it is cigar-shaped but from the angle I saw it at - although, it could have been saucer shaped. It made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I drove a little ways down to get a better view where there weren’t any trees. I could see all the way to the horizon. There was nothing there. It made no sense. I have traveled this road on many occasions and I am used to seeing planes fly overhead and I always like to look at them as they fly off into the distance. I couldn’t even see any lights or anything at all out there. It was as if it never happened.  Overall, I’d say I saw the craft for about 10 - 15 seconds, if that.

Standing in my driveway at 1am looked up over my neighbors house over the trees  I saw a cigar-shaped thing with 3 lights hovering silently, it came  from behind the trees.  I saw it hovering in full over the street for maybe 5 seconds, direct eye contact.  Then it just went from 0mph-warped speed, and varnished.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
