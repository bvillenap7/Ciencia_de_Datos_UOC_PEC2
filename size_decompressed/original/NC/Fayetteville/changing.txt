We started to walk twards is .we could not tell how close or far it was.Then after about 2 min it changed to a ball again .And moved staight up and stoped then over like at a 45deg angle at a speed so fast a plane would brake apart.then disapeard .We spent the next night out ther again to see if it will come back but it never did . To this day it was the strangest thing I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  Date may be approximate, although witness does not indicate that fact.

Meteors or any other space debri dont turn with these angles and become stationary like this..;2013-09-11 20:30:00;15 seconds;Meteors or any other space debri dont turn with these angles and become stationary like this.. The two of us were driving into a well lit neighborhood.  I noticed in the sky what at first appeared to be space dabree of some sort.   Not unlike a meteor.it appeared to slow down , turn about a 45 degree angle, then Stop.  The tail was gone at this point and it looked like a solid white light.   The short amount I've got recorded on my phone shows it changing multiple colors before it disappeared..;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
