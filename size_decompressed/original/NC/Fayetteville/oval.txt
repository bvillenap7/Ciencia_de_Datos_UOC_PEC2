Oval, orange bulb object appearing in Fayetteville, NC;2004-04-17 21:00:00;2 Minutes;Oval, orange bulb object appearing in Fayetteville, NC Name: ((name deleted)) E-mail: ((e-address deleted)) Comments: I live in Fayetteville, NC. The night of April 17th 2004, my wife and I saw a strange object approximately 100-150 feet above the ground, over the treeline in our neighborhood. My wife saw it first at about 9pm. She pointed it out to me as it was moving slowly toward our location. It appeared to stay just above the treeline. It was an orange bulb in an oval shape. It was not overly luminous because it had a medium tone. It had no trail and made no sound. I lost sight of it...as it got to what seemed to be about 1000 feet from us. It then moved to the left, back to the right, and then I lost sight of it. At its last location, it should have become completely visible in only a few seconds if it had maintained its speed. But it disappeared. I am definitely not one to fabricate something like this. I am a law enforcement officer. Anyway, I thought this would be right place to send this sighting of ours. Thanks.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
Orange bright light over fayetteville Nc;2011-01-19 20:00:00;30 seconds;Orange bright light over fayetteville Nc In fayetteville North Carolina around 8 to 8:30pm i saw a very bright orange looking light.  It was located about 5 to 10 miles out in the North West sky.  It was maybe a mile or two up from ground level. It never moved.  It was as still as looking at any other star.  It was at least three times the size of the brightest star in the western sky. At first I thought that it was a star dying or something.  I called the kids but when they came out the door it just was gone. I started to go back in but I did not. About five minutes later it reappeared in the same spot. I called my family again and they witness the event also.  It lasted about 30 seconds again and began to get brighter than extinguished.
