Missing Time and Military Helicopter.;1973-10-15 01:00:00;1-1/2 hours;Missing Time and Military Helicopter My son was about 1 year old and it was one of the normal evenings when my husband was out in the field.  He was often gone for up to two months at a time, and I felt quite at ease being alone.  It was late fall, but the temperature outside was nice enough for me to be able to go outside in my shorts.  The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson was just going off the air and I was sitting down to watch the Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder.  I remember this night because it was the premiere episode.  October 15th, 1973.   I could hear a beeping noise coming from outside and thought that it might have been one of the electrical transformers, so I went outside to see if I could find it.  There was not a hint of a breeze in the night air and it was fairly cool out.  There seemed to be no noise except the beeping.  I stood in the yard for a couple of minutes just listening, and then I heard a police siren coming my direction from the main road.  I went to the north side of the house to try to see what was happening but was blocked by all the pine trees.   Then I heard a helicopter coming from a distance and that was when I noticed strange lights fairly low to the ground to my east.  There should have been no lights in that direction because there was nothing that way except ten to fifteen miles of forest.   I walked down the street about 4 houses to see the main road behind the house and watched as something zoomed by.  It was just above the tree line, about 40 feet in the air, and was traveling so fast I couldn’t tell anything specific about it other than it was very well lit.  The 2 police cars zoomed by headed south following whatever was flying in front of them.  Then came the helicopter.  They stopped about a mile down the road, turned off their lights and returned in the direction of Ft. Bragg.  I turned around to see the lights in the forest and they were still in the same spot.  That was when they lifted to just above tree height and then blinked out.  I had no re! ason to be frightened but ran back in to the house anyway.  That was when I noticed that the television station had gone off the air.  The Tomorrow Show should have still been on because I had only been outside for maybe five minutes.  I checked the clock and it was now nearly two in the morning.  The show came on at 12:30 and went off at 1:30.  What had happened to that hour and a half?;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
Fast moving object that would just stop and then dart off and then just stop again.;1991-09-14 21:00:00;10 minutes;Fast moving object that would just stop and then dart off and then just stop again. At the time of the sighting I lived right outside Fort Bragg, NC.  I thought at first that it was a shooting star or perhapps a military plane, because they flew over my home on a regular basis, but this object was different, so it made me stop and look twice.  The object was pretty far up in the sky, it was a bright round looking light.  What made me look twice was the fact that the light was sitting still and then it would suddenly dart to a new location and remain still in that spot for a few moments and then dart to a new spot that was a good distance from the last. I just could'nt take my eyes off of it.  This went on for about 8-10 minutes and then it just took off in secounds out of sight, what looked to me to be upward.  I had never seen anything that could move so quickly and then just stop and levatate.  I have seen lots of military aircraft being so close to Ft. Bragg and Pope AFB, but I had never seen anything move like this before.  I never told anyone what I had seen that night.  I just wonder if I was the only one that saw it or did it show up on the military radar. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Bright blinking light makes high speed C shaped manuver.;1999-08-15 21:00:00;about 10 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  One of two dramatic sighting reports, submitted by a person who identifies himself as a student in the fifth grade.  In 199, he would have to have been 7 or 8 years of age.  Witness writes exceptionally well for a 5th grader, we feel.  I compliment the Fayetteville, NC, K12 school district.  We suspect that this is not a serious report.  PD))   Bright blinking light makes high speed C shaped manuver. Most of the time and date information are guesses. I know that it was in the summer of 99, either july or august, and in the evening about an hour after sundown, which would have made it between 9 and 10 pm. Now keep in mind that my location is close to sevral airports and military bases, but what I, my brother and friend of 18 years saw could be in no way mistaken for an airplane. It first appeared as a bright steady whitish blue light in the sky to the north. It cought my attension because it was much brighter than any star, especially with the glare of the street lights making most lesser stars not visible. My brother and I watched it for about 3 minutes when It began to blink. In all this time it made no noise and remained stationary. It would blink steadily for about thirty seconds before it stopped and returned to steady light. It did this for about 2 minutes before it abruptly shot upward in a C pattern curving to the left and then back to the right as if tracing a C from bottom to top at a very very fast speed then blinked out and was gone.I wish I had a camcorder. It's not the first time my brother and I have seen oddly acting lights in the sky around here. Most of them have happened between 95 and 2000, but I don't jump to tell people these things. but would have posted on this forum had I known about it at the time. I would like to also tell some of my other sightings, but I fear that since I have had at least 7 of them in the past 5 years I might be thought of as a hoaxer, but I can assure you I am not, and the things I have seen are not so extrodinary that they don't at lease in some ways resembe other sightings. My life has been full of strange, and frightening paranormal and extra terrestrial experiences, and of all the thought I have given it, I still have no solid belief as to what's going on. Ironically the truth is most likely much stranger than speculation.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
Two bright star like objects swooping down then hugging tree line....;2007-01-15 19:00:00;7 min;Two bright star like objects swooping down then hugging tree line.... January 2007, Fayetteville NC  It was around 7:00pm. I was heading west to my parents house on Cliffdale Rd. I saw these two bright lights coming out of the clouds (storm clouds just hit the area.(no rain tho) The clouds were mid altitude to low, running fast west. Now at first I thought they were helicopters, because my parents live right next to Fort Bragg. And it’s totally normal to see them in the area. Now what caught my attention was the light as they came out of the clouds (it was kinda dark all around), I thought dam that’s cool to be flying and doing that(coming out of a storm like that). I saw them and lost them as I drove. They came out of the clouds and started to head down. Now when I turned into my parents housing area, as I was going down the road and I saw the lights again behind the houses (not right behind the houses) but I could see where they were still moving west and heading down. I pulled into my parents house and ran to the back yard. The lights were bright, very bright. Both the lights seem to be independent from each other but kept a tight formation. One light was a head of the other. As I watch them, they swooped down and started hugging the tree line real close, I mean right down in the tree line. I could see the lights thru the trees, its January and the trees had relatively no leaves on them. They where constantly changing altitude, up, up, up, down, up, down up..etc... Very quick tho. I had a clear line of sight on them, before hugging the tree line. The description of the light was as follow: bright white (dead center) to white/yellowish around its edges. The light was not glowing perfectly around the object but had spikes of lights around it but north, east and west the spikes of light where at there greatest, with a long tail down (kind of like in Christmas cards, how they draw the star of Bethlehem) The tail down was really weird, it sparkled half way down the tail, slightly wavy and sparkling. As I sat there watching them, I really could not focus on them because it was all light. But I did squint m! y eyes a nd I saw a hint of blue and yellow blinking light (only one time) coming from dead center of the object. They got closer and closer down into the tree line and keep moving west right into Fort Bragg. Now I thought of every thing that it could have been. I am a military brat, seen all types of aircraft daytime and nighttime. No way was it a helicopter. If it was they are very irresponsible for flying that low in that kind of weather. Also it moved up and down so fast and tight when hugging the tree line. The other thing that I thought it could be is a flare canister with a parachute that larger military aircraft release. But the wind was strong and they would of flow apart unless they were tied together, if so I didn’t see the chute, which I think I should have been seen easily with that large of a light source. And the light was so large that I think that the chute would have caught on fire. Also when they came out of the sky the were coming down at a constant rate and smoothly straighten out before hugging the tree line. The wind was to my back going west but I tried to see if I heard anything but the wind on my ears made that impossible. The light source is what made me think. If it was any type of aircraft the light source completely envelop the whole aircraft. Never seen anything like that. I looked all over the internet and read this whole website trying to validate what I saw. The only thing that I keep reading is that people see a star like object, but I wish people be a bit more detail....thus me writing a lot...PS When I say they flew into Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg is a big base, I don’t mean the main base were the housing area is and the PX/BX, mini mall is at. But there is a large area west of bragg that’s all impact area and they have drop zones there, field exercise area, etc., also I will be sending you a map as soon as i can get it done.

Possible UFO chased by fighter jet over or near Fort Bragg/Pope AFB NC.;2008-09-30 20:30:00;1-2 Min;Possible UFO chased by fighter jet over or near Fort Bragg/Pope AFB NC. I was sitting outside on the patio smoking a cigar.  It was shortly after sundown with some lingering clouds that were illuminated brightly because of the bright moon.  Looking distantly towards the north/northwest I saw an object with a reddish glow move from the east to the west.  The light did not blink, so my first thought was that the object was the space station flying overhead.  It had been a few years since I've seen the space station overhead, so I was excited to see it again.  But then I realized that the trajectory was not they typical pattern the space station orbits over the earth.  As I began to realize that this object was possibly not the space station, another object with a flashing light akin to an aircraft or fighter jet began to follow the first object.  It sped up as if it were trying to catch up to it and then when it got to a certain distance from the first object, it locked in the same speed and maintained its course and distance with the first object.  I watched for a few more seconds before I lost view of both objects behind the clouds.  This could have occurred either over Fort Bragg or Pope AFB or just to the north of these military installations.  I am located about 2 miles south of the Reilly gate of Fort Bragg. No noises were heard and no definitive shapes could be identified. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287

At 11:42 pm, two of my buddies and I were about to walk in to my house, when i seen a shooting star, that stopped in place.  It was the size of a star, blue in color.  And zipped around the sky for almost 2 minutes.   Where I live is wide open sky, and I've seen many jets, plans, helicopters.  And northing move as fast as this.  And it would stop on a dime and the light would get dim and bright again.  Then back to zipping around.  My niece stepped outside and saw it and she called my dad who also saw it.

Bright red light sitting in the sky;2014-10-16 20:10:00;5 minutes;Bright red light sitting in the sky At approximately 20:10 my husband, son, and friend were sitting on the porch enjoy a cool evening when they saw, hovering above the trees, a bright red light.  They said it suddenly appeared and was sitting in the same spot for several minutes.  By the time they called me out to make sure they were not seeing things, the light just disappeared. They said it did not drop, did not move, did not fly away… it just disappeared. I told them to call me out there if it came back. Not even a minute later they called me back out on the porch and showed me the light. It was bright red and just sitting in the sky above the trees. It was there for about a minute and then disappeared again. I sat with them for a few minutes to see a bright yellowish light appear, then the bright red light appear to the right of the yellowish light. The lights were sitting in the same spot, they did not move up, seem to come from below, drop, or move they just seemed to sit in one spot then! disappear. I took video of the last occurrence and noticed just after the yellowish light disappeared, there was a green flash of light visible (only in the video not to the naked eye) over the red light before it disappeared. I thought all of this was strange enough to share.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287

Mysterious bright light spotted hovering over wooded area;2018-08-12 22:00:00;30 minutes;Mysterious bright light spotted hovering over wooded area I reside in Fayetteville, NC, and I live in an apartment on the second floor.  I occasionally open my bedroom blinds at night to get beautiful views of the moon & stars.   Tonight around 10p.m., I opened my blinds, turned out my bedroom light and laid in bed gazing out of the window slightly to the right of where the moon is usually visible with hopes of witnessing the meteor shower.  After looking toward the sky for sometime a bright light appeared and I noticed it was actually hovering over the woods in the back of my apartment complex.  I watched the bright light as closely as possible to rule out the possibility of it being a drone being operated by someone nearby, it wasn't.   I called my husband to come look and he saw it as well.  The bright light hovered for about 30 mins in the same spot and faster then I could blink it disappeared.   The moon & stars are not even visible tonight due to the frequent thunderstorms we are having so the only explanation is that it! was certainly an extraterrestrial sighting.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
