Elongated teardrop shape fell rapidly down the sky.;2016-09-08 18:15:00;5 seconds;Elongated teardrop shape fell rapidly down the sky. While taking batting practice, a friend and I were sitting on a bench facing east when we saw a very bright silver looking light or object falling in the sky at an very high speed.  We saw it in the open sky and followed its progress down behind trees.  It had the shape of an elongated water drop.  The tail of the light was not very long. Once it was out of our sight, we waited for an explosion, but it didn’t happen.  I don’t know if it was a meteorite or falling space debris or what it was, but it either fell into the ocean, or it was just passing by earth. It happened very quickly, and the object looked big.  At first, I thought it was a big passenger plane, but it was moving way too fast for an airplane of any kind.   The whole event probably lasted 3 – 5 seconds.;35.0339837239589;-78.9566645399287
