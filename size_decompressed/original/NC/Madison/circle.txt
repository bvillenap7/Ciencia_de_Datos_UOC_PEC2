UFO During Lightening Storm;2012-05-30 23:00:00;drive by;UFO During Lightening Storm Driving by the Pine Hall Brick water tower, I saw what looked like a mechanical double-flashing light coming from a ufo air craft seen tucked just within cloud during lightening storm. It remained stationary.  Might balls of lightening but it looked mechanical, blinking like air plane lights. As another description, would say it looked like a cell tower with a white blink but there are no towers. I could have sworn I felt an electrical vibration.
