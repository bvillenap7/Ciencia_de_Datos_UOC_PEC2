Mirror like crescent that disappeared.;2018-04-04 18:44:00;1-2 seconds;Mirror like crescent that disappeared. My wife and I were in the car, stopped waiting to turn.  My wife saw a crescent shaped object in the sky to our southeast, above the tree line.  The sun was behind the trees.  She described the object as looking like light being reflected off a mirrored crescent with a smaller object attached on the bottom.  After a second or two, it disappeared suddenly.  The car was not moving during the sighting.;36.3733;-79.9635
