That night one flew from due north over the house at a high rate of speed, it then abruptly changed direction without losing speed on a 45 degree angle to due east, then disappeared.  I’ve been spooked since. When I went out and looked the following day, at first I didn’ see anything.  The front of my house faces due south, so when I looked up to the southeast, i could see Orion, i’ve Always enjoyed Orion.  After a time, I saw what at first I thought was a star, however I saw that it was moving and appeared to be changing colors from reddish orange to a blue green color.  It looked like it was pulsating, and it would fade in and out. Some of the fading was due to a thin layer of clouds.  I then went into the house to retrieve my iphone6s to record it. I recorded 20 minutes.  When I replayed the video and zoomed in, I realized that it was 2 discs flying in conjunction.  It appears it's possible other craft came into the picture as well.  I don’t know for sure.  I watched for as long as possible, but eventually the cloud cover became too thick.  I don’t know what they are, however if you want the video footage, you are welcome to it.;33.8881;-78.4287
