orange orbs;2020-06-29 21:00:00;10 seconds;somewhere between 45-90 degrees in the night sky I saw 4-5 Orange Orbs, fireballs, they were in a straight line but was close to a chevron shape.  they were very bright and close, much larger than a star, but way smaller than a full moon of course.    They all of a sudden went out, but then one popped up again for two seconds, then all of a sudden the orange orbs were gone.  The whole encounter was 10 seconds.   There was no dripping, it did not stutter in its glow.;33.8881;-78.4287
