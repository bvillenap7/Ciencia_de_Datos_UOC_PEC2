Cigar shape craft with lights inside over Charlotte;1980-06-30 17:00:00;10 minutes;Cigar shape craft with lights inside over Charlotte, NC.   My ex-wife and I were sitting at a red light at the intersection of Independence blvd. and Idlewild Road.  We were facing North.  We notice to our right about half a block away some type of flying craft just above tree top level.  It was moving very slowly.  It appeared to be silver in color, cigar shaped and had a row of windows on its side.  It appeared to have lights on inside.   At first I thought that is was a airliner flying very low and I even tried to see any people sitting in the craft.  However, we soon realized that this was not a airliner.  When the light at the intersection turn green, we crossed the intersection and went into the parking lot of a large bargain store.  I parked the car facing east.  We observed the craft continuing to travel across Independence Blvd. at a very slow rate of speed.  We also noticed that everything became real quiet.  We could not hear the traffic nor could we hear our vehicle running although we could hear each other talking.   We were able to get a good look at it as it crossed the highway.  Although it appeared to have lights on inside, we did not see anything or anybody inside the craft.  As the craft reached the center of Independence Blvd., it stopped, hovered for about a minute and then began to travel toward the east over the highway.  Although it was now heading away from us, we never lost sight of the row of lighted windows that were facing us.  We watched the craft until it disappeared heading east.

Object was silent, immobile, and when I glanced down and then up (2 sec.) it disappeared. It was morning, around 9 AM while I was going to work.  I had stopped at a red light and glanced upward to see a cigar shaped object, @ 500-1000 up, could not tell how big this was, perhaps 100 in length.  It was very silvery, almost white, with the sun glinting on it.  There were no markings, as would be on an airplane.  No windows, no doors, no colors, no wings or fin.  It was completely stationary.  I stared at it for several seconds, trying to make out if it was an airplane.  It was completely silent and not moving at all.  I then glanced down to shift gears, then looked back up. It was gone.  This glancing down could not have taken more than  2 secs and when I looked up, it was gone.  I frantically searched the sky for it, thinking if it was an airplane it could have moved.  It was no where to be seen.  The sky was cloudless and bright blue.  Never found it again.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Cigar shaped craft seen over my home town being chased by a formation of fighter pilots.;1999-10-17 14:00:00;10 mins;Cigar shaped craft seen over my home town being chased by a formation of fighter pilots. I have no outstanding credentials that might account for what i saw but here it is. One sunny clear afternoon in Charlotte, North Carolina, I was driving in my car. I was on my way home from my ex-girlfriend's house. She lives in a town close to Charlotte. So I'm traveling on the outskirts of Charlotte on a rural road. There are farms and fields all around. I'm driving along and I notice a formation of what appear to be F-16 fighter pilots. It's not everyday you see a squadron over a populated area. And at such a low altitude. I'm no pilot, but i would have guessed their altitude to be approximately 5000 feet. Anyway, i'm watching these pilots fly off to the west and out of my view. I drive a few more miles down the road, thinking of what they could possibly be doing out of charlotte and then i see them again. Only this time they're flying back from the west heading east. By this time I'm thinking, Hey wouldn't it be cool if there was a UFO in the area.  Well by now I'm getting really close to my neighborhood (about 3 miles). I approach the crest of this hill and on my way down the other side of the hill, I look a few miles down the road. There it was. I huge cigar-shaped craft. This craft resembled the fuselage of a regular passenger aircraft but it was much bigger and longer than your average airplane. At first i thought i was seeing things, thinking that it may be a blimp, but this was no blimp. Blimps are oblonged shaped, looking much like an egg in shape. So now I'm about 2 miles from my neighborhood. Keep in mind this is a very populated area of south Charlotte. At this point I'm driving like moron trying to avoid an accident while watching this craft.. I watch it ( at first it was motionless) but it starts to head east very slowly. i watch it until it disappears over the into the trees. I continue driving, trying to look for it as i approach the aboretum (a.k.a. a very large shpping area). I turn right onto Highway 51 in the direction the craft disappeared to and i was thinking, Okay, I'm goi! ng to se e it again. But to my reluctance i did not. Finally I get to my neighborhood. I immediately called my ex to tell her what i saw. After i told her about it she said she saw those fighter pilots for a while flying over her town of Monroe, NC. Now I'm stading outside, talking to her on the phone. Suddenly i hear what sounds like thunder(even louder). I look up to see an F-16 doing an intense maneuver directly over my neighborhood. I waited 5 more minutes to see it again. But i never did see the cigar shaped craft again that day. Later that night, I talked to some of my friends. After i told them what had happened they said that earlier in the day some people had called a one of the local rock stations to and were reporting UFOS over Charlotte. To this day I wonder about UFOS and after what I saw would like to know what the military was doing over the skies of my town.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
White cigar...;2002-09-12 16:00:00;a few seconds;White cigar... I was driving around in my truck with my girlfriend when I looked down the road and up in the sky there was a white cigar shape. It was moving to my right across the sky at a steady pace. It was definitely close enough to where I could discern that it was not an airplane. About the size of my index finger at arm's length. There were no wings or tail like an airplane. We watched it for a few moments before it went behind some trees and disappeared from our view. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Cigar shaped object observered in daytime traveling at a high rate of speed at high altitude.;2005-02-10 15:45:00;15 sec;Cigar shaped object observered in daytime traveling at a high rate of speed at high altitude. The object was observed traveling at a high rate of speed from the southwest to the northeast above high scattered clouds.  Declination from the horizon was about 85 degrees.  No contrails or cloud distrubance was seen. The white object was crisply defined and brightly lite against the sky.  The shape was flattened top and bottom with sharply oval ends(cigar shape) and traveled in a straight path.  Its size seemed rather large for a distance object in space (i.e. satellite).  A small plane and a commerial aircraft was seen just prior to the sighting, which is within the inner ring of Class B airspace of Charlotte International.  This sighting was witnessed by my sixteen year old daughter while taking photos for a school project (film out at time of sighting).  She found the experience to be distorting and upsetting and reported the incidence to me the next day.  This report is being sumitted by her father who is an aircraft pilot.  I  believe the object to be a spacecraft, although its precise shape, daytime appearance and apparent closeness is puzzling. This report is part of our discussion and understanding of the sighting.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Yellow/orange cigar shaped object over Charlotte, NC;2011-10-24 19:30:00;1 min;Yellow/orange cigar shaped object over Charlotte, NC I was not sure what I was seeing.  The object was cigar shaped, yellow and orange in color with a short white tail.  At first I thought that someone had shot off a firework, but I didn't hear the whoosh sound which typically precedes flight.  I watched it travel in a a fast, horizontal trajectory, no sound at all.  I then lost it as it passed over a grove of trees. This observance was at 7:25 pm in Charlotte, NC.  It was a very clear dark evening and I know that it was not s shooting star as it was very bright.  I was the only one in my family to see it and unfortunately did not have a digital camera at the time.  Very strange.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

I missed the shot the multiple times so decided to just keep trying once I looked at my 3rd shot I cought a flying ”UFO” which was somewhat hidden in the clouds..  We were going 60mph, the photo was takin at 8:51pm with my HTC Glancer.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
I caught two UFO's side by side over Bank of America Stadium during the Playoff game of SF 49ers vs NC Panthers om Sunday 1-12-14;2014-01-12 13:25:00;10;I caught two UFO's side by side over Bank of America Stadium during the Playoff game of SF 49ers vs NC Panthers om Sunday 1-12-14 I was watching the Play Off Game between North Caroling Panthers and SF49es on my big Screen HDTV and during a Field Goal by San Francisco, the replay showed the field goal cam under the field go aiming at the sky in the path of the football then I noticed 2 strange objects in the sky.  I can't believe no body saw it.   This was broadcasted Nationally so since no one noticed, I decided to record my TV screen with my iphone to catch these objects.  I have even posted the video on youtube.  It is unaltered.  The only altercation I did was to circle the location of these crafts.  They are just hovering over the stadium way high up in the sky. I believe it was not visible to the naked eye for those attending and it can only be seen thru this HDTV, especially that the HDTV is very detail, so I circled it.   The video is 38 seconds.  So I really don't know how long these things have been up there.   Here is the video:  http://youtu.be/GSe0PVmsMwQ;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

We decided to g;2019-10-13 00:14:00;4 minutes;Me and my friends were kickin back one night. we had been up for awhile so the sleep deprivation started getting to us. We decided to go outside on the front porch of our apartment and have a cig when we saw it. It came out of nowhere, kind of like a light turning on. It was just there, nothing to build it up or anything. It just appeared. I never actually saw a physical alien, the craft just sorta hovered there. I think they might have just been observing or scanning or some other weird alien thing, studying us. It was only there for a few minutes but when i saw it it startled me and my friend greatly. As soon as i saw it the air grew still. There was a great eerie vibe in the air that ran chills down our spines, sorta hard to explain but not a good feeling. The craft looked like it had a metallic aluminum like appearance. It didn't make any noise but there were blinking lights near the bottom. It was only half a football field long and one story tall. Nobo! dy believes my story but i hope that you guys will and that someone else has a similar experience.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
