1st night saw rectangle rimmed with lights, gliding, then next night, along same path, saw 4 orbs, rotating, creating geometric shapes.;1996-03-15 21:00:00;1 min, first, then 5 mins;1st night saw rectangle rimmed with lights, gliding, then next night, along same path, saw 4 orbs, rotating, creating geometric shapes. It was 3/96, during the time that Comet Hyakutake was visible, so I was looking up trying to see the comet, from the parking lot of my apt complex.  It was around the time of the new moon, so stars were prevalent.  What caught my eye was what looked like stars “moving”.  It was in fact, the outline of a large rectangle, moving across the sky. It had lights around the rim, so what I was seeing, was the moving lights against the stars, rimming what looked like a perfect rectangle.  I followed it gliding in a straight line, not sure what direction it was, until trees blocked it, maybe 30 seconds to a minute.  It was not very high, in the sky, maybe the height of a 20-story building (I grew up in NYC). The next night, feeling freaked out by what I had seen, I had my roommate come outside with me, to “see the comet”, but I needed to face my fear.  It was about 11pm, about an hour or so later than the sighting of the night before.  Along the same stretch of sky, almost the same “path” as the rectangle, we saw 4 orbs, perfectly round, bright lights, descending slowly from pretty high up, maybe 20 to 30 stories up, higher than the rectangle from previous night.  As they descended, they were forming geometric shapes & rotating.  They’d form a circle, square & an elliptical, all while rotating slowly.  Against logic, I moved under them, watching them form the shapes & rotate.  They descended very low, maybe 15 stories, give or take I grew up in a 17-story building, it looked like they descended lower than the height of the top floor of that building, directly above my head & still rotating & forming shapes.  Directly beneath them, I could see the space between them, they did no! t look attached at all, but definitely more like 4 entirely separate orbs. After, what I’ve since described as their “showboating”, because that’s really what it felt like, making geometric shapes, slowly, in the sky over my head, about 3 or 4 minutes, they started to move, almost exactly along the same path as the rectangle the night before, still forming shapes (mostly squares & circles at this point) & still revolving around eachother, but each together gliding along that same path, until out of site, by the same trees, moving a little slower than the rectangle the night before.  They were definitely not as high up as the rectangular object.  But both nights, there was absolutely no sound from either one, complete silence.  They were both low enough, that had they been an aircraft of some kind, we should definitely have heard something. At first my roommate corroborated my sighting completely, there were no other witnesses the first night.  However, we were both quite spooked by what we saw & although she described the same thing I saw, for several months, she eventually started to say it “never happened” or that it was “explainable”.  She never did give another explanation though, she just didn’t want to talk about it. We haven’t spoken in many years, I don’t know if she’d be willing to talk about it now.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
6 or 7 lights flying in half a 'vee' formation;2005-07-12 02:15:00;20 seconds;6 or 7 lights flying in half a 'vee' formation Looked up from my deck and saw 6 or 7 faint lights in 'half a vee' formation, heading east from overhead. This line was not straight, but organic in movement, 3 of the rear lights drifted off a little and one of the first ones drifted as well. Initially I thought it was geese, but it was 2:15am, and they 'were' lit up, although faintly, and they were a long distance away - moving like a satellite, except for the 'organic-ness'. They faded fairly quickly as the transparency of the sky wasn't crystal clear. I'm into astronomy, so this was one of the stranger things I've seen - and I've seen the NOS satellites - the 3 that fly in a triangle.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
5 bright flashing  lights hovering horizontally in Charlotte NC sky at night;2008-01-26 19:00:00;30 minutes;5 bright flashing  lights hovering horizontally in Charlotte NC sky at night My husband, 7 year old son and I  were driving on I 77 Northbound towards I 85  around 7 pm (dark) and saw a bright light  in the dark sky, slightly larger than a close by helicopter would be. It was stationary so we thought it WAS a  police helicopter. Then it dawned on us that our police dept most likely doesn’t  own that many helicopters! They had flashing lights but were not flashing lights on the ground like police helicopters do when they are looking for someone etc. They just hovered ther and were very bright. As we merged onto I85 we saw 2 then 3, then 4 more similar objects/lights in the distance all what appeared to be exactly the same distance away from one another. We live in the city, at the end of a street  near a hospital ,with helicopters landing and taking off many times of the day and night, so we know what they look and sound like day and night.  We are also very familiar with the airports traffic patterns and what several airplanes coming in towards the airport on the horizon look like.  This was not like that. These objects hovered like helicopters had flashing lights of red gold and white all at the same altitude over the distance of about 10 miles altogether. As we drove down the road, (about 8-10 miles or so, we saw all of the lights remain where they were, but began to notice in between them were VERY small objects (tiny red lights) that travelled at very high speeds  between the brighter larger main objects. We stopped the car and witnessed several of these small objects travelling very fast in different directions.   Our son became worried because we were shocked and very interested to the point that we stopped the car, so we continued on to the grocery store and went inside.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Two orange orbs flying NW to SE over Douglas Int. Airport.;2011-11-03 04:40:00;1 minute;Two orange orbs flying NW to SE over Douglas Int. Airport. While getting ready to go home after ending my shift around 4:30 am at the Douglas International Airport in Charlotte, NC,  I saw two Orange orbs flying side by side from the NW to the SE they appear to not be flying very high,    It was a very night clear with no clouds, there was no sound coming from them but they were flying right above the airport then they start to zig zag between each other and coming back side by side until they vanish.  When I saw the first zig zag  between them I call one of my coworkers and we look at them until, as said before the vanish.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Strange green and red lights hovering over the Charlotte/Concord, NC area.;2014-07-28 21:45:00;1 hour;Strange green and red lights hovering over the Charlotte/Concord NC area I had went out side in front of the house, my wife and I.  We smell something burning and I thought a fire was near.   So I looked in the sky to see if I could see bright light to indicate a fire was burning.  Looking up in the sky I noticed the bright light that had green and red lights.  There were about 10 sightings, moving in and around (I went back out at 10:15 pm and they were headed south toward SC).   Not to think I was crazy I called my wife and showed them to her it appeared that they were darting in an out from behind the clouds.   Then it was crazy patterns and formations and then they spread apart heading south.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Several orbs in the morning sky off Alexander Road near Provindence Road.;2016-06-09 10:50:00;1 minute;Several orbs in the morning sky off Alexander Road near Provindence Road. I was on my way to work this morning and I saw an interesting cloud formation in the sky. I took a photo of it, and when I reviewed the photo, I saw several glowing orbs in the lower right hand corner of the photo.  There was a larger one behind a tree and several in a line formation above it. Very interesting craft. ((NUFORC Note:  We have reviewed the photo, and the only definitive image, located in the right hand lower corner of the photo, are multiple objects which appear to be reflections off the inside of the windshield.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Flock formation of unidentified craft, appearing as blue strobing lights.;2017-07-13 21:30:00;15 minutes;Flock formation of unidentified craft, appearing as blue strobing lights First spotted four lights coming across the horizon in a diamond formation.  These were followed by several more in a flock.   The lights appeared far away, behaving like fireflies, but it was obvious they were MUCH larger.  Definitely not airplanes (there was a plane elsewhere in the sky at the same time and it was nothing similar in appearance or behavior).   The lights flocked across the sky slowly, glowing off and on like fireflies.  The lights were slightly bluish in color.   Spotted from the smoking patio of The Milestone Club on Tuckaseegee ((sic.  Tuskegee??)) Dr. Did an internet search to see if there were any other reports of this sighting, found this video of an almost identical sighting also in Charlotte from 10/15/16:  https://youtu.be/qxLEnqsUYS4;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

We observed two red lights moving at incredible speeds in perfect formation over Charlotte.;2021-01-21 18:30:00;3-5 minutes;We observed two red lights moving at incredible speeds in perfect formation over Charlotte. During an evening walk, my son and I noticed two reddish bright lights in the sky south of us.  The lights were moving faster than any plane but about the same altitude as a jet. The distance between the lights was possibly a mile or more but moved in perfect synchrony. They moved in a north easterly direction for about 30 30-45 seconds then disappeared.  About 15-20 seconds later the lights reappeared due east of us for a moment then disappeared again.  No aircraft I've ever heard of could move that distance so quickly.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
