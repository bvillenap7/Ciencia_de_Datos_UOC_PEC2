I was only a child when my mother call me from the kitchen with a certain urgency in her voice that was never heard before or ever again after the event.  I suppose I was only six or seven (1974 or 1975) when her eerie cry had me running from the living room where the TV had been keeping me company.  I joined her at the window and witnessed something less than 60 meters away. “Do you see it?” she asked. I did see it.  I saw it.  Beautiful!  How flawless in form, size, and color for a vehicle.  A big, rounded flying… car?  The bottom section of the disk had a bright blue glow that was being replaced by a new color from left to right as it seemed to ooze into view.  A new color followed it around (always counter-clockwise) very slowly as I heard my mother ask a new question. “What is it?” “I think it is a…”  Then I thought, ‘My mother is asking me what it is?  You mean she doesn’t know?  Was she testing me?  The color red began to ooze in behind the last color and then just as slowly came another.  Mesmerized, my mother and I watched this thing hover just above the trees and give us the lava lamp show of our lives.  Before long we were saying the colors in unison as they came into view and waited a few seconds for the next color to appear.  I remember wanting to be the first to guess the next color or say what it was as soon as I could see any hint at what the color would be as it slowly made it’s appearance. “Blu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-e… gre-e-e-e-e-e-e-n…” “Hey Mom, can we go outside? After several minutes my panic-stricken mother moved me to the dining room where I watched it from a bay window and she made phone calls to police, the airport, my dad, and then gave up from frustration at being laughed at or hung up on.  I watched the flying saucer and for so long that I actually got bored of it and went back to the TV set only to return to the window during commercial breaks.  Alas, it was out of view.  What could have been the most remarkable encounter of the first kind, was over and done without even a single photo.  The heavily used camera was out of film.  I had one of the most extraordinary experiences ever and it never really sunk in until the day I told someone what I saw and they laughed at me.  I would give everything I own if intelligent extra-terrestrial life was be COMMON KNOWLEDGE.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

We were under brilliant illumination that was much brighter than the 2:30 pm afternoon clear day sunlight.;1994-10-24 14:30:00;1/2 hour;We were under brilliant illumination that was much brighter than the 2:30 pm afternoon clear day sunlight. I noticed intense but unusual ground effects lighting all around us before I noticed what was causing it.  There were no clouds, it was a bright, sunny, blue sky, October afternoon with the sun shining to our right, casting long shadows in the sand. I had sat down on a swing for about 5 minutes, watching my son playing in the sand to my left, when all of a sudden I physically felt an extremely intense, powerful double shock wave that initially seemed strong enough to stop my heart momentarily from beating. When I looked around me, everything was lit up brilliantly in a strange light grey light, and then looked over at my son 7 feet away from me, I could clearly and obviously see that we were being intensely illuminated from directly above. When I looked over at my son, his own shadow below his body was razor sharp around him on the sand, but when I looked straight up in the sky, the two round objects were actually about 3-4 miles over to our right instead, which was confusing because the light they were emitting made it seem as if they were only 100 feet straight above us.  His bright red jacket appeared only grey, there was no color vision at the time of the sighting.  The light seemed brilliant grey, and actually eradicated all of the shadows eminating from the bright sunlight.  They were heading south to north, same speed, same line of movement, second one behind the first one about a mile or two behind, and were the same size each, circular in shape with about 7 concentric non-contacting rows of brilliant but separate and staggered, huge, stationary sparks underneath them, but coming out of the underside of the objects. The sparks were static and appeared photographic due to total non-movement, but with random, smaller bright shards of blue and red in each of the white and also each of the yellow sparks. The first, outer, ring of sparks was white, the second two smaller inner, concentric rings were yellowish in color, the next smaller ring was white and the next two were yellowish ag! ain in c olor, with the final, smallest ring being white sparks. But in the exact center of each object was a huge black circular discharge of downward facing uneven energy, like an enormous jet black spark, as was all of the other sparks, each facing downwards as well.  I could tell the black energy was larger because it was blocking out the few rows of sparks that were behind it.  The second, trailing object then zoomed quite rapidly up to the first one, as they each continued northbound, and then immediately bounced off of without ever hitting it in two or three tiny little loops to the right of it, then instantly approached it again, and once more seemed to be deflected somehow by the first one in 4-5 little swirling looping motions on the left side of the first object.   The first object remained perfectly stationary at both times.  Then the second object went all the way back to its original distance and position and once again approached the first object again, same speed, but this time, apparently making a smoother approach, because it went slowly under the first one, because the first one started disappearing as in a crescent shape above it, and then the top one dissappeared completely, apparently as it overlapped the second one now below it.  Due to their similar size, they now appeared as one object.  Then, after traveling another few miles towards the north, above to my left, they rapidly and suddenly flung apart from each other, the top one seemed to deflect to the right where I could still see the rings of sparks on the bottom of it and then the second one deflected to the left of it flipping almost on its side at an angle towards my direction because I could see the top of it, that it was covered in a greyish brownish material, soft looking, and it had no windows or doors and had a smooth dome shape directly in the middle of its center. When they both instantly flung apart from each other, they also instantly and abruptly stopped at the same exact time completely in mid-air.  At that instant, that ! they bot h stopped in mid-air for perhaps two seconds that I could tell, then they both, at the same precise instant, disappeared from view completely without any indication of speed, flight trails or even any apparent flight direction whatsoever.   I used to work in the financial accounting field, so paying attention to details was very important.  I also did not feel threatened or afraid at any time of the sightings even because of the strange light because they made no movements towards us, they simply seemed to be maneuvering in the sky, and the way they moved so effortlessly, made it seem to me as if they were floating on top of a solid surface, even though they were so high up in the sky.

Saucer shaped object hovers then suddendly dissappears, only to reappear again;2007-08-14 04:00:00;3 minutes;Saucer shaped object hovers then suddendly dissappears, only to reappear again The outside was dark, but you could see stars and the sky was clear.  An object was seen hovering about 2000 feet in the air from a distance.  The object was shaped as a saucer and was metallic looking. The saucer was on a tilt and moved around a little for about 10-15 seconds and then it suddenly jerked west and disappeared.  About 3 seconds later a rapidly blinking light appeared and started to move around.  It then started to depict a pattern and change it every 2 seconds as it moved at an extraordinary speed across the sky. The object moved in a non-uniform line and covered a large area in 15 seconds. I lost visibility as the object flew past trees that obstructed my view.  The night before at 2:00am there was also activity in the same area in the sky however, it was much more distant than this occurrence.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Disk-Shaped Objects w/ Red and White Lights Over Incoming Flight Path of Charlotte-Douglas International Airport;2007-08-21 20:45:00;10 minutes total;Disk-Shaped Objects w/ Red and White Lights Over Incoming Flight Path of Charlotte-Douglas International Airport Charlotte, NC.  August 21, 2007, approximately 8:45 p.m.  Noticed a blinking disk-shaped object in the northeastern sky above downtown Charlotte that appeared from nowhere, moved around a small area of the sky, blinking and disappearing, then appearing again, hovered for several minutes.  I went inside to get my boyfriend as a witness and a pair of binoculars, and when we got back outside, the craft had disappeared from its location.  After watching for several minutes, another disk-shaped object appeared in the north-northwestern sky above the incoming flight pattern to Charlotte-Douglas International Airport for a few seconds, and disappeared.  Another craft then appeared directly afterward, hovering still, slightly more westerly and lower in the sky.  This craft hovered for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing below the tree line.  We were both stunned that the object was in full view and seemed to be right in the landing path of incoming flights several planes came in over the craft while it was present.  These three (or maybe it was just one on the move?) had red and white blinking lights.  Boyfriend looked directly up from our vantage point and pointed out what he described as a bar-of-soap shaped object with a satellite that looked like a glowing white orb.  I did not witness this particular object.  I am located just south of center-city with a direct view of the Charlotte city skyline and often sit on my deck at night.  I have witnessed these things for months (and often grab the binoculars and my boyfriend to witness - if nothing more than for confirmation that I’m not seeing things), most of the time over the airport or in the northeastern sky.  The objects have appeared nightly for months until about the second week of July, and were gone completely until this week when they reappeared.  They are most often saucer or disk shaped with blinking lights or steadily but dimly glowing orbs.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Bright orange light circling a disk shaped object.;2014-07-04 21:00:00;4 minutes;Bright orange light circling a disk shaped object. I witnessed the object approaching from the north heading south.  At first it appeared to be some sort of orange light in the distance as it grew closer I saw it shift from side to side slightly, once I realized it wasn't an airplane I yelled to my wife to direct her attention to the light.   As it passed us overhead we could make out the round disk shape and the light was moving around the outer rim of the disk, but not completely around.  It would start moving one way and the reverse direction, once it passed it started to fade until it was no longer visible.  There was another guy that came up to us and asked if we were looking at light in the sky and said he thought he was the only one to see it.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Flying disc stationary in clouds about NC.;2015-04-26 19:00:00;10 seconds;Flying disc stationary in clouds about NC I was on a flight somewhere above northern North Carolina between 1900 - 2000 hrs.  We were beginning our decent and were going through the clouds and I looked out my window and observed a UFO of some sorts stationary in the clouds.  It was a disc shaped UFO.  I can best describe it as shaped liked Saturn.   It was round in the middle, a ball almost with the typical disc shape around it.  It had rotating lights around the perimeter of the disk portion of it and the front of the top of the circular area towards the left of the craft.   I don't know if anyone else on the flight saw it but I know for a fact that I saw it. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I wasn't able to take a picture.  I saw it and I had to look again and by the time I got my phone out we had passed it.  In all it was about 10 seconds that I was able to see it I think.  It was not moving, it was stationary.  It was in the clouds and it just happen to be in the upper portion of the clouds and thin enough that I was able to make it out.  The lights around the perimeter were rotating but I don't know if the craft itself was rotating or if it was just the lights.  ((END ADDENDUM));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
