Reflective solid object hung motionless in the sky before shooting off at an extremely high rate of speed.;1995-02-18 12:30:00;1.5 to 2 minutes;Reflective solid object hung motionless in the sky before shooting off at an extremely high rate of speed. Around 12:30 in the afternoon, I and one other person noticed a round metallic object hovering in the sky.  I'm making an educated guess based on the cirrus clouds in the sky with the object, that it was around 17000 feet in the air.   Although it was so high it was very easy to notice because it had a very shiny, metallic surface (like tin foil or stainless steel) and reflected the sunlight.  It appeared to be a single, solid object.  I am unable to to determine how large it was, only that it was very easy to see, as the sky was almost totally clear.   The object made no sound as it hung there motionless for about 1 minute.  I had enough time to point the object out to my friend and give him at least 20 uninterrupted seconds to observe it too.   The object then took off so fast that it almost seemed to have disappeared.  It left so quickly that I would have missed it had been blinking.   At that point I realized what we saw wasn't an aircraft.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Silver Orb traveling very slowly across sky;2001-05-29 14:30:00;5 minutes;Silver Orb traveling very slowly across sky At about 1430 hrs on 5/29/01 I observed a sphere shaped object traveling very slowly(this is what caught my eye) north to south at about 5000 feet.  I work outside and being an avid ufo buff I watch the skies as much as possible.  I watched the object for about 5 minutes until it went behind some clouds and I lost it.  The interesting thing is that while watching the object a commercial plane flew right under or close by it.  Due to my angle of vision I could not tell how close. The object was silver in color and a little smaller than the size of a pinky nail at arms length. Also, a I watched the object there seemed to be a haze or unfocusable area around it.  No sound, and no light.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Shiny silvery orb following plane;2001-06-13 14:00:00;1-2 minutes;Shiny silvery orb following plane Same as last time, but today I saw another bright silvery ball following a plane on landing pattern to Charlotte Douglas International Airport.  It was just off the right side of the plane as it was descending.  I work outside and live near the airport so I am familiar with their landing patterns.  Today, we had a Tropical Storm passing through so there was periods of sun and periods of rain. Durng a sunny period I was watching planes making Chemtrails all over the sky when I first noticed the shimmer of the sun on a plane overhead and as I watched, I noticed the shiny ball or sphere riding right along side of the plane.  As I watched the sphere it seeed to just disappear within a minute or so.  Also as I noted before, there was a fuzzy area around the sphere which made it hard to focus on.  I'm not a expierenced judge of distance but it wasn't very high up at all,as the plane was on a landing pattern. Thanks;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
White dots in a clear blue sky.;2001-10-30 10:30:00;10 minutes;White dots in a clear blue sky. I looked out my window and saw two planes, at different altitudes, crossing paths and in the same line of sight were 2 round white dots just sitting in the sky.  The sky is perfectly bright and blue with no clouds at all.  At first I thought nothing of it and then thought that this is kinda weird.  They looked like stars but it's too late in the day and they were too bright and too big to be stars.  I went to another room to grab my binoculars and went outside.  When I got outside I was unable to find the objects.  I returned to my office and looked out the window again and there they were.  I thought maybe my eyes are playing tricks on me.  The whole thing was driving me crazy.  I was sure they were really there.  Sure enough I found them in the binoculars and watched them.  One was positioned at 12 o'clock and the other below it and to the left at 8 o'clock.  As I watched, the lower one moved to the right.  Both of them appeared to be followed by a light cloud of smoke, not a stream.  As the lower one approached the 6 o'clock position both of them just disappeared as if they ducked behind a cloud, yet there are no clouds. As I write this description of the event, one hour later, a third or one of the original two has appeared in the same place.  This time I took a picture but it surely won't show much as the object is too small and the camera too weak.  As I watched, it has drifted out of sight away from me and upward. I've never thought that I had seen a UFO before, although I have always believed in them.  I don't know what a weather balloon looks like but this was definately a unique experience and I'm positive that what I saw was not conventional aircraft.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Bright orange/yellow light appears.;2002-08-05 18:00:00;1-5 seconds;Bright orange/yellow light appears. Well i had given a neighbor a ride a little way up the street in my jeep(i had the top down) and was on my way back home traveling North to South i guess when directly ahead of me but way way away a bright orange/yellow light slowly appeared and lasted for a couple of seconds then dissapeared.Now i was driving on a busy street at rush hour changing lanes when i saw this i had the feeling that there was two other lights that were dimmer next to it but i couldnt tell,it was a clear day and very hot i am 100% sure it was not a plane this was HUGE to high for a helicopter too,i lost sight of it because of trees in my strret so it could have lasted longer,i never saw it again.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Large White & Orange Sphere over Kannapolis Concord NC Area;2003-07-28 02:00:00;3 minutes;Large White & Orange Sphere over Kannapolis Concord NC Area I was traveling South on I-85 outside of Kannapolis/Concord NC at 2:00am on Monday July 28th 2003 when I noticed a bright light over the trees to my left.  I would not have given it much though except that it was so large and bright.  I watched it as I drove looking for some type of support like a pole underneath it or perhaps an aircraft above it.  I reached a point where there were no trees in the way of my view and I saw for the first time that it was hanging in midair completely independent.  Intrigued I pulled my car over to the side of the road, got out, and tried to make sense of what I was seeing.  It was a ball of light, about the color of an florescent light bulb only a bit whiter and much brighter and when I say ball I mean a 3 dimensional object in the form of a sphere, and it was as far as I could tell a perfect ball shape, no flaws apparent, very vivid, very well focused, sharp edged sphere. The color was uniform through out its surface except for a small patch of orange on the bottom. You know how when you look at an incandescent light bulb you can see the filament burning inside of the clear or frosted glass? Well it was nothing like that.  The light was even through out, almost as though it WAS light.  The object made no sound, it did not change in intensity, there were no sparks, no fumes, no smoke, no windows, no antenna, no landing gear.  I could not tell it's size but I know it was big.I could hold my hand out in font of me at arms length and cover about 90% of the object. I didn't have the slightest bit of fear, I was to busy taking it all in.  Every fiber of my being told me that what I was witnessing COULD NOT BE HAPPENING.  I spent the entire time determining what it was not, and believe me  I wanted it to be something I could identify, but it was not.   1. it was NOT an airplane 2. it was NOT a balloon 3. it was NOT a helicopter a) if it was a helicopter with a spotlight pointed at me, then they would have had to be pointing the light directly at me and continued to point it at me until it went out of sight because the light never became an ellipse.  It maintained its circular (actually spherical) shape for the entire observation plus I never heard a sound. 4. it was Not burning swamp gas a) it would seem to me that if it were a gas then it would have been some irregular ever changing shape as it would be unconfined. 5. it was NOT Venus, a meteor, or a re-entry / launch 6. It was NOT the moon. 7. I don't think it was Balled Lightning what ever that is. I don't know if it can exist on a clear, and calm summer night but it just seems as if it could not have been so large and so steady then move slowly away without a perceivable change in color or intensity. 8. It was NOT a satellite. a) it was not viewable the next night same time/place b) it filled a full four inches of my field of view, c) it did NOT appear to move along with me as I traveled south. I started out looking forward towards the object. Then saw it through a break in the tree line and it was right beside me.  By the time I pulled over (half a mile later) it was slightly behind me. 9. It was NOT built by McDonnell Douglas.  I observed the object for about 2 minutes then it moved slowly away from my line of sight toward the East until I could no longer see it.  This is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me in my 36 years. It was real, and I will never forget one moment of it. ((NUFORC Note:  The planet, Mars, would be visible in the southern sky at the time of the sighting, but it would not be as large as a man's fist, held at arm's length.  We do not know what he observed, but it sounds quite interesting.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
((HOAX??)) I am actually a little freaked out that I am even in a position where I reporting something like this.;2007-03-20 01:00:00;4 hours;I am actually a little freaked out that I am even in a position where I reporting something like this,  but I have nowhere to turn.  I have had an encounter with something not of this world.  I am a 21 year-old college student studying to become a teacher.  One night, about 1 a.m.,  I was returning home from studying late at the library.  I was suddenly forced off the road by a blowout.  I stopped the car and began to change the tire when suddenly my car radio started changing channels rapidly and the car lights began to flicker and dim.  All of a sudden everything just stopped, even my cell phone was off.  I could barley see anything as my eyes didn't have time to adjust to the darkness.  Across the road right at the tip of the tree line I saw a small orb-like object hovering and slowly changing color red, orange, yellow, green, and blue.  It hovered for about 15 seconds and then started moving rapidly in a square pattern around me, about 50 feet up for another 15 seconds. At this point, I remember feeling a warm paralyzing sensation through out my body. The next thing I remember is opening my eyes, and finding myself directly in front of the car tire with the tire iron in my hand.  The only difference was the time, it was 5:30 a.m. and starting to get light.  The spare was changed and leaning up against the car, I don't remember getting that far with the tire change.  I drove home in a state of shock and when I arrived in the house I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.  My right eye had a red mark on the outside corner I had red marks in the back of my throat and soreness ((deleted)).  For the next 3 days, none of my body functions were operational, meaning I did not defecate or urinate for that period of time.  Usually, I am very regular.  Since that time I have not slept and my appetite has all but vanished.  My desire to study or do anything productive is gone. I am really scared that something has been done to me physically, or there is some underlying trauma that my mind is blocking out.  Please help me, I can't stop thinking about it, and I feel I am going crazy.  ((deleted/obscene)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  The obscenity included in this report, in its original form, makes us wonder whether it was intended as a serious report.  We include it here, nevertheless.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Bright, spherical object flying over Charlotte, NC;2009-09-02 12:05:00;5 minutes;Bright, spherical object flying over Charlotte, NC I was outside in a small park called The Green, located at 400 South Tryon Street in the middle of downtown Charlotte, NC, when I witnessed a single sphere flying in the sky approximately three miles south of my location, and approximately 2000 feet high.  The object was round and either white or silver in color.  It was quite far away, and very small, but definitely visible as the sun was positioned in the northeast sky and so was reflecting very well off the object.  The sky was filled with lots of clouds, but with much blue sky in between.  The day was bright and quite windy. I first noticed the orb moving in a straight horizontal line across the sky from northwest to southeast.  Given the proximity to Charlotte Douglas International Airport we see airplanes in the sky all the time, and initially I assumed that was the case here.  But the object did not look like a plane, even from a distance.  It was definitely round.   Within one minute of my first noticing the object, it slowed, then came to a complete stop. It hovered for a moment, then slowly descended.  I can only guess at the distance of the descent, but it must have been at least a couple hundred feet.  It was a smooth, seemingly controlled, descent that took less than one minute. The object hovered again for a couple of minutes.  It was not entirely stationary, rather it moved around a little bit, perhaps just moving with the wind.  It was very windy on the ground, so it was probably even more so up in the sky where the object was.  Even so, all of the movement I saw seemed very controlled and stable, not as though it were just a balloon being blown around. After this, the object started rising.  It rose back to its original height, in a mostly straight line, but now it was also moving south - away from me.  The object continued to rise while moving south for about 2 more minutes until I lost sight of it. The obvious conclusion is that this was just a balloon being driven by strong winds. And it may have been.  But the object was very visible even though it was very small and far away.   Perhaps a mylar balloon would have this effect, especially with the sun being opposite in the sky.  But given the distance it was from me, I really think the object was much larger than a balloon otherwise I would never have been able to see it. Also, the movements seemed very controlled it was not being whipped about.  It's path may have been affected by the wind, but given that it initially was going in a straight line, slowed, stopped, descended, stopped then ascended in a uniform manner it just did not at all appear to be a balloon.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
On December 14th I was outside walking around my neighborhood with a friend of mine. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a white circle;2011-12-14 23:58:00;2.5 Seconds;On December 14th I was outside walking around my neighborhood with a friend of mine.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a white circle quickly flying across the sky.  It was enormous, at least 1.5 times the size of the moon.  It was a circle and was completely white.   It zoomed from behind me and went about 3/4ths of the way across the horizon before completely disappearing.  I asked my friend if he saw it and he had not.  I just assumed it was my imagination then and forgot about it.   About half an hour later, I was sitting on a bench by myself listening to some music and gazing at the stars when I noticed a huge blue circle zoom across the sky.  It had a blue edge to it with a black center with what looked like blue electric bolts connecting in the center of it.  It was massive and like the first, disappeared about three quarters of the way across the horizon before entirely vanishing.  Stupified, I stared at the sky for the next half hour when I saw a shooting sta! r, so I know what that looks like, so I am positive I did not confuse the two.  Picture of the second one is posted below.  It was the one that I saw perfectly clear.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Three orange orbs seen by me and a witness at Food Lion parking lot.;2013-10-19 21:53:00;7 minutes;Three orange orbs seen by me and a witness at Food Lion parking lot. My report, On October 19, 2013 at 21:53 hours I saw three orbs of orange lights moving from west to east in Charlotte, NC. I had my clock set for 22:00 hours to alarm, but I could not sleep so I got up at 21:30.  When I left the house I noticed a light in the sky.  I thought it was an aircraft but looking again I did not see any of the anti collision lights aircraft have.  I was heading up to Beatties Ford Rd, keeping an eye on the light.  I made a right and saw there were two lights and also noticed that they were orange with a red hue at times.  I hurried up to the parking lot of Food Lion on Beatties Ford Rd, got out of the car noticed there were three. They ranged from 85 degrees to something like 60 degrees above the horizon.  Each object disappeared once they reached the 60 degree mark from horizon one by one. I needed a witness and pointed them out to a guy that was passing by.  He said he did not know what they were but he kept walking.   Tried to take a picture with my phone camera, but that did not work since the moon's light was too bright and the objects were too high.   I watched till they all disappeared.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

They were spherical/orb shaped and appeared somewhat like Chinese lanterns, but were high in the sky and moved against the wind. They appeared to maneuver in formation. We wondered if they were drones, but again, they appeared to be high in the sky and to be visible, would probably have to be larger than drones.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
