Noisy, sky train moving slowly with suden accellaration;1999-07-01 19:30:00;1 minute;Noisy, sky train moving slowly with suden accellaration Hello: I looka t the sky a lot, am an amateur astronomer.  This report is of a craft I have not heard described very much. My son was losing a baseball game very badly, so I walked away from the field and was looking at the top of the trees. The craft came from my left, roughly south and headed north.  The best way I can describe it was a sky train.  This craft was perhaps 200 yards long but only, perhaps 30 feet wide.  It was at an elevation of perhaps 200 feet and was rather noisy.  The noise was a rhythmic humming.  There were multiple sections (very like a train) and they were all illuninated, greenish and yellow lights. It eas moving rather slowly, perhaps 50 mph, but once it cleared the tree lines it accellarated dramatically.  I have never seen anything else like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Two red dots next to each other over South Charlotte, NC  heading towards Matthews,NC (East) about 2000 feet?;2005-11-17 18:55:00;30 seconds;Two red dots next to each other over South Charlotte, NC, heading towards Matthews, NC, (East) about 2000 feet? I was walking my dog just before 7pm when I saw two red lights heading my way from the west.  At first I thought it was a plane because I can see flights coming or going from the airport from here everyday in the distance.  I'll try to describe best I can.  You know how planes have a light at the end of the each wing... it looked like that ...  one on each end, both red, solid, not blinking.  It came from my west point of view....(yes, towards the airport kind of.)  But the strange thing for me is that their was nothing between the lights?  It flew directly above me at about 1500ft no higher than 2000ft at the most heading to Matthews, NC, my Northeast.  I could see in between the two red dots to see stars when it moved across the sky where if it was say a plane you'd see the two red dots then if it crossed a path of the star it would obstruct the few of the star for a second but it didn't.  I couldn't hear any engines and it moved somewhat across the sky like a plane would but I had a GOOD look at for at least 30 seconds.   Nothing I've ever seen before and I'm always looking at the stars when walking my dog at night.  I was just hoping someone else might have seen this also.  I'm not easily floored but it was a weird experience.  Any suggestions?;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
UFO spotted over NC & SC.;2007-01-24 20:00:00;About an hour;UFO spotted over NC & SC. Charlotte Observer, The (NC) January 26, 2007 Section: MAIN Edition: ONE-THREE Page: 1A     WHAT WAS THAT LIGHT IN THE SKY? UNKNOWN FREAKY ORB DREW EYES, IMAGINATIONS ACROSS AREA   Earthlings, you've had an otherworldly experience, a cosmic encounter.  About 8 p.m. Wednesday, something peculiar flashed in the sky - something twinkly, something colorful, something eye-catching. Something strange. And blue. Or green. Or blue-green.  Bright blue-green ball with a white tail, says one man from Shelby, who spotted it just west of Blacksburg, S.C., after dinner at a Steak House.  A greenish-like light low in the sky, says a woman, driving home from church with her kids near Matthews. We thought a small plane or helicopter was going to crash.  A slow-moving bluish glow, says a man from Polkton and who watched it while soaking in his hot tub.  Large, bright green ball, says another man, who was headed to Chick-fil-A in Gastonia with his wife and four children after church. Had a haze about it.  Almost looked like a flare, reports a lady, who was on Interstate 485. Kind of creepy.  Venus, perhaps? It's often a suspect in UFO sightings, particularly when it's as bright as it is right now.  Not Venus. It vanished beneath the horizon about 7 p.m.  Stricken plane?  Nope. All aircraft accounted for.  Space junk? Errant satellite?  Negative, says NORAD. No re-entries of the sizable man-made objects they track.  OK. So ... alien object?  Bingo. But not the E.T. variety.  A fireball, says the observatory director and astronomy professor at Appalachian State University in Boone.  Based on the reports, the director believes it was an unusually bright meteor that burned up about 30 miles high in the atmosphere somewhere above Charlotte. Sightings came from more than 100 miles away.  Many witnesses say the light appeared to fizzle at the end and break into pieces, making it a special kind of fireball called a bolide. In the universe of meteors, they're A-List entertainers, known for their splashy finales.  Each day, an estimated 4 billion meteors burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Most are the size of sand grains, but rocks tumble in, too. NASA estimates that the Earth packs on several tons a day in meteors.  Some witnesses who contacted the Observer on Thursday wondered whether it could be debris from the recent anti-satellite test by China.  Probably not - but maybe, says a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command near Colorado Springs, Colo., which tracks satellites and space junk - everything from lost screwdrivers to astronaut gloves. He says he's been getting an unusually high number of calls this week about things spotted in the sky.  China's satellite-zapping exercise has probably increased space litter by about a million pieces, making it nearly as untidy as Interstate 77 in Charlotte.  It's anybody's guess, the spokesman says, what direction this stuff has gone.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Small kidney bean shaped UFO over plaza-midwood (east side of charlotte) midmorning;2013-02-04 08:55:00;2 minutes;Small kidney bean shaped UFO over plaza-midwood (east side of charlotte) midmorning Two of us (one adult male and one adult female) were witnesses to this sighting.  At the intersection of North Davidson and 11th street, near the onramp to 277 we observed an object hovering stationary in the sky toward the East/South, roughly over the Eastern side of Plaza- Midwood area, could be directly over Central and Hawthorne. It was on a Monday morning at around 8:55 AM.   Upon entering 277, we watched the object stay stationary and kept it in visual range until the beltway passed the exit for 4th and 3rd street, roughly 2 minutes.  During that time the object did not change position.  It struck us as odd because it was not behaving like an airplane or bird, and was too low in the sky for an airplane other than for an approach to landing or takeoff.  It was in the right location for a large bird, but it was not flapping any wings or gliding.   The oddest part was the shape, which is difficult to describe but I will do my best:  It was kind of a lopsided kidney bean shape, vertically oriented and proportioned so that the upper half was slightly larger than the other, rounded, and slightly curved or -c shaped.   It was too far away to make out any discernible details, but it appeared to have a surface texture or facets, and did not appear smooth and shiny. After we were out of visual range, and I was dropped off at work, my counterpart returned to the area about 10 minutes later, but the object was missing.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Massive dark bow shaped flying object over Uptown Charlotte.;2013-03-09 22:15:00;20 seconds;Massive dark bow shaped flying object over Uptown Charlotte. I live on 5th and Graham in Uptown Charlotte and at approximately 10:15pm, I was smoking a cigarette on my balcony and coming from the middle of the city over the high rises was a massive flying object.  I would describe it as almost having the look of a bow.  It was moving at about the pace you would see an airplane in the sky moving, but there were some significant differences.   First, this thing was massive, maybe the size of 5 airplanes in the sky.   Secondly, this flying object was not lit up at all and was very difficult to see (you wouldn't even notice it if you were just glancing at the sky).   I couldn't believe what I was seeing and expected it to  be gone in a flash, but after a few seconds I called out for my girlfriend to come see and she came out.  I pointed up and asked her what the heck we were seeing.  We both were shocked and couldn't explain it.   Crazy experience and it is the first sighting for both of us!;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

The aliens were making a very high-pitched sound and it was very fast. the only way to describe the sound was that it was (di ga diggi di ---a digga dii ga di) repeating over and over again like frequency.   The alien did have the typical big eyes but not the same shape head as seen on tv for a typical alien.  The alien was white or a tannish color rounder shaped oval head.  It had the typical alien nose but the mouth was bigger and wider.  I was paralyzed but could only move my eyes and also there was one behind me because I was laying on my side rocking me back and forth.  I was trying to break free but could not move and then wend fully unconscious.  I do remember being levitated and pulled or dragged out of my bed.  The next day I went downstairs and asked my nephew did he sleep ok that night.  He said to me unc I could hardly sleep there was this giggi diggi di sound going on and I thought! it was the radio. Well later that day I went into the shower and when i came out I gasped and my heart started beating fast.  There were patterns all over my body red scratches hand prints and they stung a little.  I called my sister who took picture, I as well took pictures and had a friend of mine with a high quality camera come and take pictures of all the patterns on my body.  I have been visited before but NEVER has it been like this.  My friend said man they really got you and he was in shock.  He said it looks like someone strapped you down to do all of this.  I have the pictures I will be happy to share.  One pattern on my back that stood out looks like the eye of Horus.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Multi-colored flashing lights around a stationary orb.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Sirius.  PD));2014-12-14 21:00:00;1 hour +;Multi-colored flashing lights around a stationary orb My friend called me to report two bright stars in the sky flashing multi-colored lights. He gave me the approximate location so I went outside with my phone and binoculars and saw the larger orb.  I could see the flashing lights with my naked eye - green, red, white, blue. When I used my binoculars, they were very bright and clear, like an LED light, not blurry, and flashing in a rotating pattern around a glowing orb. I live near a flight line and witnessed several planes pass by.  This was not a plane.  It hovered in the same spot for about fifteen minutes and then began to slowly drift south.  Not fast.  I could barely tell it was moving. At one point it disappeared then reappeared within a few seconds.  As it drifted south, the flashing lights lessened in intensity.  I could only see them with binoculars at that point as the light seemed to be getting a bit smaller and looked more like a bright star to the naked eye. I brought my husband outside to w! itness the phenomena.  He is ex military and said it was not a plane or helicopter.  There was no sound. I took a video with my phone.  Granted, it's not the greatest and the orb looks small but you can still see the flashing lights.  I'm not sure what it was.  I've tried to debunk but honestly, I can't come up with an answer.  At one point on the video, I describe it as resembling a flashing Christmas tree full of multi-colored lights. What impressed me most was the brilliance of the lights.  It may not be anything but I wanted to report it since it was so unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Sirius.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Small white oval shaped UFO over Charlotte countryside airspace;2015-07-22 08:15:00;5 minutes;Small white oval shaped UFO over Charlotte countryside airspace I was flying from Charlotte to Richmond, and had a window seat.  It must have been 30 minutes-1 hour out of Charlotte, while flying over a very big lake that looked like a scar in the ground, when I saw it.  It was a small white object.  It was hovering, and the plane was passing over it.   It wasn't a helicopter, and it was just bellow the clouds, so it couldn't have been a commercial drone.  It almost looked like a shark.   It was white, and had a small tail fin, which went into an oval shaped body with kind of a dark center.  From the small oval shape, it looked like a sideways wing was jutting out (like if a plane was flipping left, and the wing was sticking out at an angle).   It did not look very big, and I continued to look at it until our plane passed it entirely.  It was moving, but very slowly, slower than cloud speed, and it was just sort of hovering there.  I would have taken a picture, but my phone was dead, which is ironic timing. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Yes it was around 8:15-8:30 AM.  No one but me saw it (that I'm aware of).  I was flying by myself and didn't really want to be that freak in the window seat who was trying to get people to look at the UFO haha. It's amazing to me how many reported sightings there are.

The sk;2018-01-23 15:15:00;30 minutes;At approximately 3:00 p.m., I was driving in the car and had parked in a carpool lane to pick up my kids from elementary school.  The sky was perfectly blue but I noticed it had rivers of chemtrails.  They were not clouds.  I counted at least 2 planes initially spraying the chemtrails.  See photos for how robust the trails were.  The planes were spraying and then the trail was dissipating and flowing like a river in the sky. After picking up my kids, I parked the car in the parking lot to get a better look at the planes.  This was about 3:12 p.m. The plane closest to us looked to be right overhead, and looked white or metallic and very bright.  It was spraying a chemtrail and then it ran out of spray and continued flying in a straight line heading back into the blue sky over the school.  I thought it looked more like a TUBE than a plane.  It also was low enough that I would have expected to hear an engine noise, but it was silent. I looked away for just a few moments to get my camera phone from the car.  My 14-year-old daughter, in the meantime, had her phone camera and was snapping shots.  When I looked back up at the sky, the plane had completely disappeared and was nowhere to be seen in the expanse of the blue sky.  It just vanished. With 3 kids in the car, I started to drive home, and on our way, saw several other planes in the sky--I counted about 6 of them in the distance, in close proximity to each other, all spraying straight chemtrails.  I pulled over to the side of the road to observe them and pointed them out to the kids.  I asked my daughter to get shots of the many planes, but she was unable to capture the shot with all of the planes, but she did get the chemtrails in criss-cross patterns. With the kids in the car, and very astonished, I decided to drive around the corner block and return to the point where I could view the planes again.  It took us no more than 2 minutes to drive around the block to the same spot.  By then, every single plane had completely vanished, just like the other one.  This was simply not possible. We caught the photos and now see that the vehicle closest to us did not look like a plane, but a SHINY, METALLIC, TUBE WITH OVAL SEGMENTS IN AN ANT-LIKE SHAPE and there seems to be some kind of black tubing wrapped around the side.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Whooshing sound with 1-red and 3-white lights that went silent.  ((anonymous report));2019-07-12 03:30:00;20 minutes;Whooshing sound with 1-red and 3-white lights that went silent. At approximately 3:30 a.m. EST while on work break in South Charlotte I heard a strange whooshing sound for about 5 minutes, I looked up and did not initially see anything.  The sound continued, but did not get louder nor distant, then I saw a single red blinking light followed by 3 very bright and vibrant white lights (brighter than those that come from Xenon gas bulbs) that flashed one at a time making a line pattern in a different direction than the red light, making it appear as if the object was changing course,  however,  when the red light would re-appear, it was at the front of the direction the object was moving, and the white lights were angled off to the side. .  If all those lights were to be illuminated at once, it would have made an “L” shape.  I see all types of commercial and military air craft here at night especially being in the flight pattern of the airport, I have also seen weather balloons, satellites (no blinking to their lights) and the international space station fly over.  None of which had the sound or light patterns I experienced tonight.  The strangest part of this experience was that when my eyes focused on those lights as it was directly above my head, the sound ceased.  Even as the object passed, and what you would usually hear from the rear of a craft as it passes by, there was complete silence as I watched it move overhead then eventually out of sight.  I have to add, I am a total skeptic and I have tried for hours to make logic of this experience, but the more I try, the more questions I have.  Most importantly, if it were a military type jet propulsion aircraft the sound is more like a constant distant thunder (even when it is very high in the sky) that gets louder as it gets closer, then the sound gradually fades.  This was not at all like anything I have ever heard…the sound was more like the noise an MRI machine makes at top speed.

He said can you please follow me so you can see for yourself.” I was very hesitant and I wasn’t trying to believe him I’ve never believed in aliens but this was very different. So I say sure I will follow. So as were walking the star with flashing lights kept following us back-and-forth when we will stop it will stop to we were walking back-and-forth for about 30 minutes every time we stop it will stop as well. I called down my boyfriend and say hey come downstairs there’s something very unusual happening. As he starts coming downstairs there was about three other neighbors that came downstairs as well for a split second in our face It was like a shooting star put in front of us it wasn’t even in the sky. It almost felt like it face  scanned us. So as of now there’s six of us outside we keep walking back-and-forth and it just keeps following us I understand about the earths orbit and how rotating end it was very unusual that when we stop the stars like thing stopped as well when we kept walking and follow back-and-forth back-and-forth it was so crazy so unusual I’ve never witnessed something like that before. It’s crazy that all six of us saw the same thing and because it was so dark outside it was very hard to record it this is not normal and I know it was something out of this planet.     It’s crazy that all six of us was walking as a group together and it followed us a shooting star went right in front of us for a split second it’s crazy that all of us saw it.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
