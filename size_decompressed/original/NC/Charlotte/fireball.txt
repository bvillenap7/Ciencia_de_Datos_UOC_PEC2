I waited to hear someone else report this but none els has stepped forward. So I'm reporting it myself. I Teach Swimming on Tue & Thurs. I was leaving the Aquatic center ,headed north. I was stopped at a red light when I looked up anb spoted a Green Fireball. I have bee a sky watcher all my life. Shooting stars/metiors tend to 'burn out in about 1 second. This fireball lasted a lot longer and  never did 'burn out'. It was huge (about half the diameter of the moon). It was in the north.westernn sky. It had a trajectory of due north. It appearded to be decending until it finally switched off. (it did ndeminh in intesisty) It just went out like a candle. It was Green in color but the perimeter was red/orange.  It did not change directions or make any manuvers to indicate a controllable aircraft.  I could not acertain altitude. However It was not a natually occuring item/event. I will include my personal info. However, I make my living in the technical community and do not wish for you to publish my name or personal info. fcontact you i;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

We live about 15 miles from airport....this was 20 times faster than anyplane I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot). Just a bright streak, but you could tell there was a mass at the front.  It was not like a shooting star. Probably a comet, but I swear it was in the atmosphere. The object made no sound ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Weird object goes across sky and boards a sationary object.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2010-01-27 20:30:00;20:30-20:31;Weird object goes across sky and boards a sationary object Saw a dim light travel across the sky it wasn't emoting any lights or anything just a steady yellowish white.  I first noticed it left of the constelation cassiopeia so I watched it for a few seconds about thirty then it colilded with  another dim object but no exsplosion it was like it boreded a mothership or something.  the object that was stationary was located between the stars caph and errai and I thought at first it was a satelite.  Once I located the stationary object with a telescope it was rectangular in shape and gave off a faint glow. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Orange colored super fast object;2011-11-26 20:15:00;2-3 sec;Orange colored super fast object Initially i thought it was a shooting star but it was an orange colored object (it felt like fire), the object was traveling quite fast (faster than anything i saw flying in the sky).  I could see it for 2 to 3 seconds before i lost it in the buildings.  It felt like it was heading down to earth.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Fluorescent green teardrop fireball falling to earth.;2011-12-08 23:00:00;3 seconds;Fluoresent green teardrop fireball falling to earth larger traveling north to west at a 45 degree estimated angle. It looked like it was crashing because I know how they can maneuver.   I see ufo’s all the time disappearing and reappearing in different locations in all spectrums of colors but this was different this was so close.  I’ve seen meteor showers they are bluish to bluish white and large.  Shooting stars (meteorites) are distant smaller this was not a normal It was a flaming fluorescent green fireball teardrop shaped about the length  of an average full moon or larger and thick width wise with no sound absolutly silent.  I wanted to be an astronomer  all my spare time goes into exploring my little area of sky  I know what is normal and what isn’t.  if you want to talk you know my number  North carolinia;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Then imploded but with no sound at all(my window is down), and the object just goes blue and disappears heading west over I-85 away from UNCC.

Bright orange orb travels and disappears.;2018-08-13 21:05:00;2 minutes;Bright orange orb travels and disappears. Wife and I where driving eastbound on Arrowood Rd towards Walmart when we looked towards the sky and the thin crescent moon.  Up in the sky there was an orange glowing dot that seemed to get bigger and bigger.   I asked my wife if it looked like an airplane and she said yes it then took her words back as we continued to drive.  The ball moved westbound and it looked like a faraway ball of fire.   As the light grew bigger we both realized it wasnt a recognizable aircraft.  I asked my wife to record as we attempted to make a U-turn on the boulevard to keep watching and hopefully record it.   As we stopped, the ball suddenly disappeared out of the sky.  We where both skeptical about what we saw as it was not common.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Green and white fireball coming toward Earth.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-29 06:45:00;6-10 seconds;Green and white fireball coming toward Earth At the dog park alone, I saw one unidentified fireball/comet like object.  Its tail was white, and the fireball was neon green.  It was traveling quite fast at a 45 or so degree angle toward the earth.   I did not hear an impact, which surprised me, nor did I hear any noise associated with it.  It was much to large to be a drone.
