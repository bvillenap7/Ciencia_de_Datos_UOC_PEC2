Flying objects seen while watching Leonid meteor shower;2001-11-18 04:30:00;3 minutes;Flying objects seen while watching Leonid meteor shower I had woken up at 0400 to watch the Leonids meteor shower. Clear skies Temperature apprx 45 degrees. Went out back slidding glass door to see if meteors were visible since I live near large city. After watching for a minute, saw first meteor, went inside to wake my wife. Returned outside with a blanket so we could lay down and not strain our necks. My wife came out at apprx 0410. We had been watching for about twenty minutes when I saw objects. They were directly overhead moving from southeast to northwest. I could not tell how high they were, could not make out any detail except that they were light grey colored, circular, did not have any lights or emit light, and no sound was heard. They appeared to be the size of a pea at arms length. Being near dawn I initially thought they were aircraft with sunlight reflecting off bottom. But the two craft seemed to change course toward and away from each other several times, which I didnt think any plane would do. We watched the for about three minutes, till they went out of site. Continued watching meteors for approx ten more minutes, than went inside to get ready for work.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
A perfect circle...;2002-07-07 12:00:00;20 seconds;A perfect circle... I was in my truck with my girlfriend at the time. We were sitting at a stoplight. I looked up and saw this perfect circle. It was metallic in color. My girlfriend saw it too. It was about the size of my fist at arm's length and was hanging motionless in the sky in broad daylight. It couldn't have been more than 500 ft above the ground and it made no sound. We looked at this thing until the light turned green and were not able to see it after that.

This thing stood motionless in the sky. It was way too big to be any sort of star. A perfect circle. My girfriend and I watched this thing for a few seconds wondering what it was and then traffic started to move. We drove down the road but never saw it again.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Strange balls of light in the sky;2009-07-15 21:00:00;60 seconds;Strange balls of light in the sky On this particular incident, me and my sister were outside on my balcony in South Charlotte, NC.  I happened to be telling her that she should observe what goes on in the sky at night.  The skies were clear and we could see the stars very well.  I have on two other occasions, in Virginia Beach, have witnessed an incident of a ball of light that I could not explain what it was.  While staring over the night sky, I noticed a light, that was, it seemed to me was trying to disguise itself as a star.  It was like at first glance it looked like a star but after staring at it, I could tell that it was not outside of this atmosphere.  Then it started to move.  It moved horizontally thru the sky, It was completely silent.  It was far away.  We lived in an area that was in a busy flight/landing path of the Charlotte Douglas Airport. There was not a flashing light on this object as airplanes have.  As it moved, it was on a horizontal glide and trailing it was a faint t! rial of light.  It definately was not exhauaust from a plane that will linger after the plane passes.  This light was like a smear behind this object that was flying.  There was no 'exhaust' trail left behind. The further it traveled across the sky, the dimmer the light was.  I have seen many shooting stars and meteor showers and cannot compare this object to what I saw.  I know that it was not ordinary because my sister was becoming uncomfortable looking at it. This object was not a sudden fade like a shooting star...This was a calculated, dimming of the light that I had witnessed before. The very first time I had seen something like this was at my home in Virginia Beach, VA...Right near the Chesapeake border.  I have always liked looking up at the stars and one day I stepped out of my house to smoke a cigarette and while waiting for my sister to come outside, I looked straight up.  That is when I saw a star that was very bright but it has a dull yellowish tint to the light....it was not pure white light like a star...but it looked like a star.  I stared at this object for about a minute and then it started to move. First a slow sway back and forth then it started raising it's elevation.  Even though it did not look like the size was shrinking siginficantly I could tell that the swaying was moving away from me.  For about 30 seconds, this object swayed back and forth like a metronome and as it swayed the ligth gradually got fainter and fainter until it was completely gone.  There was no noise and I know that this object was not a plane or a helicopter. After that, also in Virginia at the same home, I went outside on the porch again to smoke a cigarette.  This time it was right about when the sun was going down.  The sun would set behind my home and it was down far enough that the only thing that was lit was the sky.  The shadows from the house and trees were at their max 'stretch'.  I looked over to my right at the sky.  Some stars were already visible.  I saw this one star that was unusually bright that I know was not the North Star.  It just seemed like it was out of place. We lived in this home for almost 30 years and I had never noticed a star that bright in that area of the sky at that time of the day before.   While staring at this object after about two minutes, I noticed that it was moving...back and forth...It was almost like it moved becuase I wouldn't stop staring at it.  The way that it moved back and forth, made me feel like it was staring at me too.  There was no noise and this light was a perfect sphere.  It ! didn't twinkle like other stars.  As it moved back and forth, I could clearly see that it was raising its elevation and that same trail of light was following it. The higher it climbed, the dimmer it got, still bouncing back and forth until it completely disappeared.  That took about a minute or two from the time that it started moving for it to fade completely out and when the light was completely gone, there was nothing that made me think it was a plane or chopper or any other man-made vehicle.  It is disturbing that I have had three incidents that I have seen an object flying in the sky that I could not identify.  I am originally from Virginia Beach and this is a highly active military area w/ airforce bases and naval bases nearby.  I am not a stranger to seeling military planes and have also seen a stealth bomber fly by...  These objects were not planes. Hopefully this information will be helpful to you in your research.  One thing that resignated with me from watching programs about UFO's is that if there is a race of anything in outer space that has the capability to make it to our planet, how so far we are behind in their technology as we cannot get a human past the moon.

Early Sunday morning coming out the house I looked up in the sky and seen what seemed to be a space craft.

That night/early morning sky was a little cloudy but visible.  I've seen a craft before when I lived in NY but not like this one.  It wasn't moving just hovering over the moon.

Blue orb with aura seen on American Airlines flight near Charlotte, NC, airport.;2016-05-14 18:45:00;6-10 seconds;Blue orb with aura seen on American Airlines flight near Charlotte, NC, airport. On an American Airlines flight Leg with my wife and daughter from Orlando, FL, to Charlotte, NC, I looked out my window as the airplane was slowing and beginning its decent to the airport (at cloud altitude) on May 14th, 2016, at approximately 6:45pm.  The weather outside was blue sky and partly cloudy. I saw a blue orb not far from the plane at our altitude (just above and aft of the right wing) in a mix of clouds and blue sky.  The orb was distinctly circular, small, and stood out because the shade of blue did not match the sky around it.  It definitely had an aura to it. It appeared to be standing still because our plane did not zoom past it.  I had a clear view of it long enough to watch it slowly pass my window, turn to tell my wife, Do you see that?, then turn back and see it go by the passengers window sitting behind me.  It was clearly not a strange reflection in the window because I saw it from the second vantage point through the other passenger's window at a different angle.  The lights in the cabin were also turned off.   It was difficult to determine an approximate distance since I had no reference.  Very strange.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
White light that made no noise, moved very fast, low moving, very bright, pulsates, able to disappear and reappear in a blink of an eye;2016-06-25 21:40:00;45 seconds;White light that made no noise, moved very fast, low moving, very bright, pulsates, able to disappear and reappear in a blink of an eye I was outside star gazing with my new telescope I recently purchased.  I look up at the sky towards the airport and I see nothing, I turn around and then look again to see a small but bright pulsating light (white light) appear from no where.  This light was away from any airplane routes that planes take to either land, or take off from the airport.  It was hovering for a few seconds then started to move north (left on my camera.  I did get a recording of this object) it made no noise, and was not very high up.  Moved very fast, was able to come to a complete stop in the sky within seconds.  I followed this object for about 30 seconds until it started to flicker.  The object/light.  Disappeared after flickering.  It reappeared again only to disappear within a few seconds. Note:  there were NO clouds in the the path of the object.  There were clouds but very far in the distances...No way clouds could have made this object disappear   This light was very strange, I have seen other lights like this over the years, but in many different colors.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

On Saturday night, around 7:15pm, I went out onto my back deck to grill out.  As soon as I hit the deck, I immediatly saw a line of large round orange balls, heading from north to south towards our airport.  They were in a straight line as far as I could see.  From left to right the sky was full of them, I would say about 15 to 20 orbs, but each was staggered behind each other, all at the same altitude, approx 1,000 to 2,000 ft above my location, and approx 75 to 100 feet apart from each other.   As soon as I saw them, I went back into the house and yelled for my wife to come out here, she came immediately and saw what I was seeing.  As they flew by the last ones about 4 or 5 of them started to go dim and then they went totally dark, it was mind blowing, they had no sound and were very bright orange they had no red, green or white nautical (sic.  navigation?) lights on them.
