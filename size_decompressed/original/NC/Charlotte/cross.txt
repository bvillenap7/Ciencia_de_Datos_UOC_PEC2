Stars moved as group, not airplane.;2008-10-28 23:30:00;20 minutes;Stars moved as group, not airplane. I am watching it right now.  My wife is asleep.  As in the neighborhood.  It looked like far away stars.  And I thought, wow what a pretty constellation, I wonder why I never saw that before.  Then they started slowly moving in different directions. The stars or lights would swirl slightly chaning from 4-7 stars.  The positions would change of each individual light, as well as a together as a whole.   It moved very slowly and not in a straight line.  It would meander in the same area, but definetly move across the sky.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

I am pretty sure that i saw 1 of the craft split away from the group and touch down ten or so miles away.  I didn't have a camera on me so all I could do was wait and watch.  I know it wasn't an airplane because the craft just stopped for a minute and then just stopped. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
