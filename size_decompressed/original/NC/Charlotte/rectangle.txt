Large Rectangle UFO floating over north Charlotte, NC;2004-09-15 17:05:00;5-10 seconds;Large Rectangle UFO floating over north Charlotte, NC I was driving north on I-85 approaching the UNC Charlotte campus.  Traffic was heavy during the 5 o'clock rush hour.  I was going about 15 mph.  Suddenly in the sky ahead of me about 1/2 mile away appeared a large gray rectangle.  I estimate it's length as long as a football field.  It was gray with panels that were somewhat reflective.  It floated motionless and then drifted to the right.  I lost sight of it behind the tree line as I drove along.  I had time to remove my sunglasses so I watched it for approximately 10 seconds.  As I drove along toward the campus, there were several auto accidents.  I can't explain what I saw.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Large dark gray rectangle hovering in northern sky;2008-09-14 10:00:00;15 min;Large dark gray rectangle hovering in northern sky I was on NC 51 at around 10:00 heading into Mint Hill, when I looked out the window and saw the craft on the horizon to the north. The craft did not appear to be moving. I initially thought it could have been a banner of some sort, but after stopping the car and observing for a few minutes, it was obvious this was not the case. First, the craft was much too large to be pulled by a plane and had no text or picture of any kind. It was a flat dark gray color. From it's position relative to mine and the apparent size in the sky, it appeared to be much larger than an airliner. I drove down Lawyers Road toward NC 27 to get a closer look at the object as it appeared to drift westward. I did not seem to be getting any closer to the craft as it was still a considerable distance away when I got to NC 27. I turned around and returned to Mint Hill and was unable to see the craft once I had stopped again. About 15-20 minutes later, I was outdoors again and looked to the north to see if the craft was visible. The craft was emerging from behind a cloud on the horizon, which gave good indication of it's distance. There were very few clouds in the sky. The craft appeared much smaller, probably further away. It was drifting westward once again and disappeared behind the trees.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
