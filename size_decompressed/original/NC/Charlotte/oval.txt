A large nocturnal bluish-green oval seen by tens of thousands.;1973-10-18 20:00:00;30 minutes;A large nocturnal bluish-green oval seen by tens of thousands. One October night back in 1973, my father, sister and I were going to find the location of the local charity haunted house in the Queens Road area. I was 7 at the time and was interested in space and any kind of airplane. I was actually mad that I had to leave the house that night because of a report that I saw that was coming on NBC Nightly News with John Chancellor that I wanted to see. The report was on the flap in Mississippi at the same time. Subsequently, we found the haunted house and drove by, not stopping to go in, when we turned around to go home and saw a huge bluish-green oval in the sky. People in their cars were looking up and pointing to it. We followed in the general direction of the craft and turned into a neighborhood off Archdale Dr. near Park Rd Park. As we approached a group of trees in a front yard the object seemed to turn and as we cleared the trees the object had vanished. From that point on I have studied the subject intensely. I currently work at CDI Airport and am familiar with all sorts of aircraft. It was no aircraft, civilian or military, that I have seen then or since. It wasn't a weather balloon, temperature inversion, searchlight, swamp gas, Venus or a mass hallucination (my favorite BS explanation).    Half of the city reported it that night and I am absolutely certain of what it was that we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

It was heading south at about 20 m.p.h, and I don't know what it was but it was silver going over some trees as I was leaving school.  It was heading south at about 20 m.p.h, and from what I heard, was silent but I might be wrong because there were cars going by.  It was silver in the shape of an oval but it could have been the bottom of a disc shape at an angle.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Bright orange object in the eastern sky.;2001-07-15 02:20:00;2 minutes;Bright orange object in the eastern sky. Object appeared due east of my location at about 20 degrees above horizon. The object was semi-circular on the bottom with a low pyramid shape on top. I watched it for about 2 minutes as it became a bright orange color and seemed to grow larger. It then quickly receded with no apparent movement. I assume that it either was moving directly toward me or away from me which would explain the apparent stilloness of it.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
One oval, silver craft spotted over highway, appeared to hover and then fly away;2003-09-25 19:10:00;3 minutes;One oval, silver craft spotted over highway, appeared to hover and then fly away Observer's background:  Rather interested in UFOlogy, never reported a sighting before.  Have been a witness to several 'haunted' house phenomena, however.  Sighting occurred over I-485 and Johnston Road exit.  While driving, I noticed a shiny, silvery object ahead of me in the evening daylight.  It appeared to be stationary which is why it caught my attention.  Over the next 30 seconds, I approached it and got as directly underneath it as possible.  That's when I pulled off the road to get a better look.  It was a brief moment after I pulled over that the object began to move away in a very straight line at a rather moderate and constant speed.  It was small from my vantage point, but very obviously oval shaped, and silver-reflective, and appeared to be darkened in the center.  Everything about it was just odd, from it's shape, reflectiveness, the way it appeared to begin moving from a dead stop, and the way it just seemed to 'cut through' the air in an extremely straight flight path.  It was still light outside, and I could see no lights, no trails, and heard absolutely no sound (I was pulled off the highway). There is quite a bit of air traffic over this area, and as such I am rather used to seeing airplanes in the sky.  This, I can say, certainly did not look like any airplane I've seen, nor a helicopter.  If anything, it resembled an ovoid blimp shape, but it was quite small/high up and just didn't stike me as a blimp.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
small orange oblong craft seen over Charlotte, NC at 19:14 on October 02, 2003;2003-10-02 19:13:00;2 Minutes;small orange oblong craft seen over Charlotte, NC at 19:14 on October 02, 2003 I saw 1 orange clearly glowing object moving horizontally from NW to SE at about the speed of a jet craft would go at that altitude, which could have been about 5-7 miles high. There were no unusual movements.  The craft got smaller and smaller but it was not possible to tell whether it was getting further away or getting smaller.  I'm assuming that it was getting further away.  It seemed therefore to be moving horizontally and further away at the same time, so it's direction was more NNW to SSE from my vantage point.  I was walking exactly SE according to the map I just consulted. There was nothing on the craft that didn't glow, and the color of the light was uniformly orange, glowing orange (though not blinding).  Due to this fact I felt compelled to report it, as I'm convinced that it wasn't 'one of ours'.  The orange light wasn't a 'running light' or anything.  The entire craft was glowing orange.  It was shaped a bit oblong, like an ellipse with a very large major axis, almost to the point of not being an ellipse anymore, but a cigar.  Its size was such that if you held up your pinky (little finger) you could hide it from view (possibly requiring you to close one eye, although I didn't try this).  The glow was slightly larger near the front I suppose indicating more volume or mass in the front of the craft.   And, this was definitely NOT Mars.  Although the craft wasn't moving at any 'fantastic' speed, it was still moving quite a bit too much to be mistaken for a planet.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
We saw two UFOs chasing an airplane.;2006-03-04 16:45:00;10 min.;We saw two UFOs chasing an airplane. My friend and I were sitting in my backyard and all of a sudden our phones and watches stopped working. We looked up and saw two UFOs heading in the direction the moon was in. Then we heard an airplane coming and the UFOs changed direction and started chasing it. They were sort of a bronze color and looked like an oval with shrp pionts on the end.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Hot UFO spot in Charlotte NC;2006-03-25 04:00:00;2 minutes;Hot UFO spot in Charlotte NC This report is to inform people in an area that they are in a hot spot for UFO activity.  The area is in a 2 to 3 mile radius of North Carolina University of Charlotte where Interstate 485 belt highway and interstate 85 intersect.  First sitting was 2 or 3 years ago 4:00 AM while traveling within 1 mile or less I observed 3 perfectly round objects glowing extremely bright, almost to the point of blinding me.  They were motionless and hovering about 10 feet directly over the rooftops of houses.  At first glance I thought they were streetlights.  But they were way to high and large.  I pass this area every morning and have never seen thing that looked like that. Sitting number 2, about three weeks ago I was coming home and had just traveled through the interchange from Interstate 85 going north unto Interstate belt road 485 going south and it was raining heavily and something catch my eye, it was dark in color, looked like a tube 10 ft. wide and 40ft. long, a cylinder shaped and turned vertical, like a barrel flowing in sky, but this was glowing at the bottom end, very strange.  I flipped my eyes back to the highway not wanting to cause or be in an auto accident.  I believe this area is a hot spot for UFO activity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I was working and had to go outside. I looked up to my right, and saw a very, very fast orange object go over the horizon. I don't know what it was. It was very high in the nighttime sky. The only thing I know for sure is that it was faster than anything I have ever seen. It was so high, that is looked very small. As fast as you can snap your fingers, it was gone.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

2 White Oval Balls moving across Charlotte NC sky;2010-05-06 12:30:00;12 minutes;2 White Oval Balls moving across Charlotte NC sky While @ Work... I went outside @ 1227 for a Smoke-Break.  As I was standing there facing NorthWest I noticed an small odd cloud sitting @ about a 50 degree angle from where I was and @ my 1100. I looked down, then back up and the cloud was gone. In it's place was a small white oval looking ball.  The sky was clear Carolina Blue so it was obvious. I immediately pulled out my Nextel and got a Co-Worker outside to see it too.  We watched it sit still in the sky kind of morphing shape for roughly 3-4 minutes and then it started easing slowly East.  Right then, my Boss drove up and started watching it also. Just before the Sighting ended, I noticed another Ball just East of the 1st one. After maybe 20 Seconds, they both just Vanished. You could see them kind of Fade Out of sight. Not due to distance, they just Faded out. I watched them Fade in/out a few times before finally disappearing. I am the Gen. Mgr for a Logistics Co. in Charlotte and have had Military Experience. I am an avid plane spotter and ALWAYS watching the skies. Lastly, as an observational note. The objects were hard to see without my Polarized Sunglasses. I kept pulling them off and passing them around so everyone could get a clear view. Had I not had my Glasses, I probably would have never noticed either object.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

You could see the depth as it floated in mid air.  Went back later to make sure i wasn’t getting it confused with a light and it was not there anymore.  At that time i decided to pull over and get a full look at the sky to make sure i wasn’t over looking the bright light and it was Gone.
