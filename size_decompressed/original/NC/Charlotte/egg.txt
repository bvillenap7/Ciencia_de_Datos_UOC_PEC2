A small, white object followed a plane about to land at the Charlotte airport.;2000-05-16 11:00:00;1 minute;A small, white object followed a plane about to land at the Charlotte airport. I was on a flight from Houston to Charlotte when I saw the object. (since I live in Houston, I have no idea of the zip code or county) It was egg shaped except that it had a flat top. I was able to make a good determination of its size by watching it fly through clouds. The result- 5 feet tall, 2 feet wide. I only observed it for a minute, but it seemed to be flying parallel to the plane. Whenever the plane would turn, it would stay in the same place. It sped up sometimes, and I lost sight of it about 30 seconds before we landed. I was able to determine that it was a real object (because of the clouds), but it could be a strange remotely piloted terrestrial craft. However, I could not determine the object's propulsion system, and I don't think something that size can fly that fast. I made sound observations, and there's no question in my mind that I saw a solid object that wasn't an airplane. But here's the problem- I was reading Above Top Secret by Timothy Good on the flight. I don't think it impaired my ability to see, but Phil Klass might say otherwise.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Silver egg-shaped objects following aircraft around Charlotte International Airport;2001-06-01 13:00:00;5 minutes;My wife and I lived on Lake Norman from late 1992 to mid 2002.  Starting around 1998 we began to notice silver egg-shaped objects following aircraft around Charlotte International Airport.  I would estimate dozens of clear sightings from 1998 until 2001.  Most of the sightings were on clear, sunny days but some on cloudy, overcast days.  The craft were mostly viewed following south to north, which would be more with departing aircraft but on occasion they would follow aircraft on high-approach, north to south.  Sometimes above and behind and sometimes below and behind. I am ex-career Air Force so I have a pretty good knowledge of aircraft and flight behavior.  This was always a formation type pursuit as if they were pacing the aircraft.  If I were to judge distance I would estimate up to a quarter of a mile behind at times but on occasion we would see one directly above or below usually 300+ feet from the aircraft.   Objects would pace the aircraft from seconds to a few minutes and sometimes it was not uncommon to see the object switch and follow another aircraft.  This would go on from five to ten minutes and sometimes more.  Altitudes generally ranged from 3000 feet up to 5000 feet. The objects were always silver-metallic and egg shaped.  About a third of the size of the aircraft, generally a commercial airliner, 135 or DC-10.  There were no other markings on the object but you could clearly see it was sphere shaped and no flat surfaces visible.  A very polished and smooth looking object.  When the object left it was in an instant like a bolt of lightning.  Just a streak across the sky and then gone!  Can't imagine the G-Force it had to undergo when it disappeared. Never did set a pattern to when they would appear but it was often enough that neighbors and people we knew from around the general area would see them and talk about it.  Occasionally would witness objects with pulsating, multi-colored lights pacing aircraft at night but not very often.   Spent most of my young adult life on or around Air Force bases but have never witnessed anything like that before, or since I left the Lake Norman area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Brief sighting of Egg/Orb heading North to South;2003-04-11 15:00:00;30-45 secs;Brief sighting of Egg/Orb heading North to South My home is located approx. 1 mile northwest of Charlotte Douglas airport.  While sitting on my back porch watching clouds and airport traffic I noticed an egg/orb heading north to south very slowly at about 10,000 feet.  At one point it seemed to briefly pause and continue.  It was shiny and hard to see without my polarized glasses.  I had my camcorder with me and I got a little footage of it but I couldn't see it in the viewfinder, only on playback could I see it and the few seconds was poor but there. The clouds at that time were moving west to east.  I'll keep watching....;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
About 20:30 on 4/8. I see a blur of light out of the corner of my eye. I look up, ((Staarlink satellites??));2011-10-05 20:30:00;3 minutes;Taking dog out in the backyard, about 20:30 on 4/8. I see a blur of light out of the corner of my eye. I look up, I see what I would describe as balls of light flying overhead in a straight line. They were silent and relatively fast moving toward the city proper (downtown Charlotte). They were definitely above the clouds, partly cloudy at the time. Ran in to tell my family, my son came out and saw them as well. Iâ€™m guessing there may have been hundreds, given the time, but not sure.  Bizarre.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
