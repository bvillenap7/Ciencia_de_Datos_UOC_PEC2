Multiple lights and strange star like objects seen.;2014-07-29 04:00:00;30-60 minutes;Multiple lights and strange star like objects seen. I was outside on my back porch having a cigarette and some coffee early that morning while it was still dark and noticed a formation of whitish blue colored star like objects in a formation moving left across the night sky.  Some of them would push in closer to the other or move up higher.   I also noticed to my right another whitish blue object that was actually bigger than the other objects to the left and it seemed to be moving upwards in the sky and would dim it's lights and then become faint then glow really bright. I think that particular light was originally lower in the sky and when i looked at it through my binoculars it seemed to be shaped like a spherical galaxy or what you would call a saucer.   The most eerie aspect of these sightings was the last object i saw not far from that one which was a yellow light that was the same size as the blue whitish one and it was also moving across the sky even farther right to the last one.  It was a yellow color but! it flickered red at first as if it had rotating orb like lights on it and i thought i noticed it rotating as i looked at it through my binoculars but it was hard to say for certain from that distance. Upon closer inspection it seemed as though it may have been shaped like a cone or and upside down pyramid of sorts.  The light rays coming from it even bent like it had a very different shape than any average type of aircraft upside down boomerang.  I thought it looked strange.  It seemed to change it's direction a lot.  It would continue its path to the right yet it would simultaneously be going up but then seem to go towards the left.   My brother also saw this as he was with me at the time and we were talking out on the back porch when i pointed it out to him.  One last thing that i noticed while this was happening was a sudden flash of blue light that radiated out like a perfect circle from a very small circular point in the sky and it was in between the objects that were seper! ated by distance. It also happened to be in the middle of clou! ds.  I ca n rule out thunder or lightning because it never followed suit with more flashes or any thunder or rain.  The sky was clear save for a few clouds and the flash was a circular shape and very bright.  I do live close to an airport but i did not hear any sounds whatsoever and they were all sighted very high in the night sky.   This happened on Tuesday the 29th of July 2014.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
