A friend and I were on a porch at a bar (no I only had a couple of beers). It was a cloudy night as the city lights were reflecting off the clouds/no stars could be seen. I looked up and noticed white lights (about the size of stars) poking randomly through the clouds. My friend saw them, too. Neither of us could explain this phenomenon as anything but UFOs. Some years later I saw virtually the same lights on a video broadcast on TV about UFOs. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Similar UFOs sighted exactly a year apart;1997-12-25 02:00:00;20-30 sec;Similar UFOs sighted exactly a year apart On Christmas Eve several years ago, my brother and I witnessed a bright red light with smaller moving white lights hover close to our house and shine brightly for several seconds.  Because the blinds on the windows were closed, it is difficult to report the actual shape and movement of the object.  We do know that it was outside of our second-story window.  Interestingly, we saw another UFO exactly a year later under very similar circumstances, though we believe the second sighting was simply white with no red.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

I was standing on my drive way looking up at the sky.  I noticed a star that seemed to be moving across the sky directly over my head.  It was moving perpendicular to all the airplanes in the sky.  It was moving slowly.  After a minute I lost site of it behind a tree.  A second later there was a flash from behind the same tree.  Sorry, I can't give the exact direction in was moving in because I can't find my compass.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

As one jet moved toward them, one moved away at a much greater  speed and both disapeared. My 15 year old son and myself were at a local shopping center around 6:00 pm on Tuesday, Oct. 26, 1999.It was still daylight. WE had noticed and mentioned  that there was a lot of jets in the sky, All in the East sky near the horizon. Approx. 6-8. When we got out of our vehicle in the parking lot of the store, we noticed what looked to be two small yet very bright stars, If you were looking at the sky as a painting you could say that they were about 2 apart. I hope that this is a reasonable discription. I know that it was many miles apart in reality. The jets were leaving a short trail behind them and seem to be moving very fast. They were very high in the sky and seemed to be about the same heighth in the sky as the two still objects. As one of the jets got closer to the first object, the one on the left just disapeared and the one on the right moved to my left and away from the jet at a much greater speed than the jet ( many times faster );35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Bright planet like light that hovered for a minute and then sped away at a tremendous speed.;2002-02-09 05:55:00;2 minutes;Bright planet like light that hovered for a minute and then sped away at a tremendous speed. On the morning of 2-9-02, at 5:55AM, I glanced out of my upstairs window and noticed a very bright light just above the treeline. It looked like a star/planet except it was about 3 times the brightness of jupiter and it was facing north. I immediatley knew this was not a star. >From my upstairs window i have a great view of the sky over Charlotte facing north towards downtown. I can see about half of the sky including the buildings downtown. The light hovered just above the trees for about a minute. It appeared to be about 2 miles away from me. After about a minute the light started to drift a little to the right and then a little to the left. I lined my eyes up with the crosshairs in the window to make sure i wasn't seeing things. I wasn't. After drifting further to the left the light abruptly turned and sped off towards downtown. It passed behind the Bank of America (BOA) building a flew off out of sight. As it was moving away from me I noticed a small red light behind the light. I was astonished at how fast this light moved across the city. I spend a lot of time watching planes and helicopters fly around the city and I have never seen anything cover that much distance in so short of time. I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to convince myself that I saw a helicopter that was hovering with a spotlight on and then speed away very quickly. The only problem is the math. It took the light approx. 5-10 seconds to go from the spot where it was hovering to behind the BOA building. Taking the angle that i saw the light from my window and drawing a line out across the city, the closest point from that line to the BOA builind is 1.75 miles (this is best case scenario. i think the distance was more like 3.5 but i am taking the closest possible distance). 1.75 miles in 10 seconds is 630 miles per hour. That is again using the best case scenario (at 3.5 miles the speed is 1260). I am not aware of any helicopter that can go 630 miles per hour from a dead stop. Also the helicopters i have seen flying around have 2 blueish/white lights on the back not a small red light. I also did not hear a sound from the light. I can usually hear planes and helicopters all the way to downtown. I have no idea what i saw but it's not anything i can explain using rational logic. I can't believe in a city the size of charlotte, nobody else saw this light.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

A coworker and I were in a seventh floor conference room facing east when we observed a object in the sky that seemd to be a blinking light. We couldn't tell if the blinking was due to it possibly rotating and reflecting from the sun. The object was not moving in the sky then it moved quickly from west to east in the sky. It quickly changed directions and moved west to east. Then the object changed altitude vertically and then continued back on a west to east pattern.....It suddenly stopped and then quickly ascended into the atmosphere out of sight.

As I approached the Sam Wilson exit I noticed to my left a bright light just hanging in the sky as I watched for a few minutes the light did nothing and just stood still . Then all of a sudden it moved a distance of about 6 to 8 miles from beside of me to ahead of me in less than a half of a second and came to another dead stop as I watched for just another minute or so the light took off again and just litteraly vanished in thin air headed in a North East direction. I calculated the speed of this craft to be a minimum of 43,200 miles per hour. I know that this craft after what I had seen was not man made.

It then began to spin counter-clockwise until a ring was visible.  It then shot toward the western sky toward some arials that are southwest of my apartment.

pulsing light racing us on the highway outside charlotte, nc;2004-09-24 02:00:00;45 seconds;pulsing light racing us on the highway outside charlotte, nc for some reason my roomate and i decided to leave wilmington and drive to charlotte at 11:00pm on thursday night last week. we had planned on going on friday but decided to leave that night spontaneously. a stop at the gas station for soda and cigs and we were off. when we crossed the bridge and got on 74 i noticed that there were no cars in front of us or behind us as, as if we were the only ones on the road. we spent most of the ride listening to music and relaxing, frequently looking at the night sky. at about 2:00-2:15am when we were roughly 20 miles from inner charlotte on highway 74 a ball/disc of light came up  parallel to our car on the passenger side right above the trees as if it was traveling along the direction of the highway as well. It made me feel weird and unsafe because it rode right next to and infront of us. a good way to describe how close it was it was like 3 lanes over, about 40 feet in altitude, pulsing, producing a pulsing trail that was similar to a tear drop stretched out. it began to move side to side and up and down rythmicly pulsing and gave us one last big pulse and it just dissapeared/vanished into thin air. this was my first encounter/eye witness of whatever it was and i am now addicted to glancing at the sky, frequently scanning for it.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Amber/Orange lights hover in Charlotte sky;2005-01-03 19:20:00;5-10 min.;Amber/Orange lights hover in Charlotte sky I was on the phone with my girlfriend at about 7:20.  I was outside smoking a cigarette, and through the trees above my neighbors house a light/fireball looking object appeared.  It was about the size of a street light but was quite a distance away.  It was a much bigger light than any plane, and stayed in the same spot the whole time while other planes flew in various different areas of the sky.  It was also higher in the sky than any streetlight, and above a large forest area, so it was definately no ordinary aircraft.  While watching it, the object would dim and brighten randomlly.  At one point, another object that appeared to be the same type showed up next to it.  That object disappeared but the first object stayed.  At that time I went inside to get some binoculars and I told my brother to come with me.  When I looked at the object, it seemed to be 2-3 lights.  They were amber or orange in color.  Right after my brother came out, the object seemed to dim and just went out completely.  We watched for a few more minutes but it was gone.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

I thought it was a High flying plane. The light pulse of the object was unusual in that it pulsed about every 5 to 10 seconds and was very bright...about the brightness of a medium to bright star. It cought my attention because of its unusual pulsing timing.The object pulsed about 4 times and then after the 4th pulse I could see the object as a speck or dim star size light streak accross the night sky in a westerly direction in a slightly arching pattern and disappeared.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

I was playing tennis at night with my wife on the Fourth of July, when my wife guided my attention behind me to the pitch-black  Northwestern sky.  Fireworks were going off in the distant western sky far from the 2 red pinkish glowing lights that were moving slowly from Northwest to North. I watched for a moment and realized they weren't anything I’ve seen before. We moved away from the court so that we could get out from under the overhead lights and get a better view. I'm 38 and have seen planes, helicopters, flares etc. and the glow that came from these objects was unlike anything I'd seen. The moon was in the opposite southeastern part of the sky. The objects seemed to move at the same speed in a straight line for a minute then hovered for approximately 20 seconds then continued moving simultaneously together. I was blocks from a camera so I decided to just watch it. After a minute and a half the light following disappeared either going suddenly beyond sight or just fading. Then another thirty seconds passed and the last one faded. The entire event lasted approximately 2 and a-half minutes. I’ve never seen a UFO or have any need to make crap up.

small roving light turns to two, then comes toward us and changes size and color again.;2009-09-22 05:30:00;2-5 min;small roving light turns to two, then comes toward us and changes size and color again. I saw from my back porch what I thought was a pen light going back and forth over my 6ft privacy fence from my kids slide to the end of the swing set, back and forth about 8 ft in a sweeping motion.  Thinking it was kids scoping out the yard/house for something to steal I sent my rotti out who did not react at all. Then the one sweeping light became two that were perfectly parallel and coming forward towards the house. I then thought it was intentional, and having an X with a restraining order, I thought for a moment he had someone out there and ducked under a glass table, that’s when the two parallel lights, about 10 ft off the ground, moving towards the house, went from a pinpoint white light, to a yellow silver dollar sized light, and I said, “ nothing does that, nothing moves parallel like that and comes at you!” my friend ran out and said, “there is nothing behind it!” I think meaning a light source. Still, my dog who goes off at squirrels, was not at all alarmed, and h! e’s 70% blind. There was no sound.  But the two yellow lights came about 20 ft into my fence line, and when my friend got to where it was, it just stopped and was gone.  We got a mag light and looked behind the fence for footprints, but there were dead tree limbs I threw out a week ago, that obstructed the path and there were no broken limbs, even on dried, dead limbs.  There was no way for someone to stand near my fence and with the dramatic angle behind my house for someone to shine any light up my 20 degree angled yard without being at the fence line aiming up.    There was no sound and my dog never reacted as if anything was out there. It was the most amazing and unexplainable thing I’ve ever witnessed.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

A couple dozen orange lights traveling against the wind.  ((NUFORC Note:  Very reliable and convincing  witness.  PD));2011-07-03 03:00:00;3 or 4 minutes;A couple dozen orange lights traveling against the wind Around 3 am Eastern time I happened to notice 3 orange circular lights traveling North by Northwest.  I was looking South when I saw them and the speed and trajectory they were traveling was consistent with a commercial jet.  These lights were not blinking or fading and they were roughly 4 or 5 times the size and brightness as the largest visible planet.  They were close to being in a straight line, made no noise whatsoever, and left no trail.  Had they left a trail, I would have guessed they were meteors. At the time I was with 2 friends who also saw the objects and thought them to be odd enough to quickly call their wives outside to check them out before they disappeared over the horizon.  It was then that one of the wives exclaimed there were more coming, and sure enough 3 or 4 more appeared from behind the treeline and followed the same path at the same speed.  More kept coming in random intervals for the next couple minutes, sometimes only 2 at a time, sometimes up to 5.  There were no patterns I could discern except for a couple groups seemingly forming a perfect triangle.  There were about a couple dozen total over the course of 3 or 4 minutes.  We managed to get videos on cell phone cameras, but they are what you would expect from filming with such a device against a dark sky. We were amazed and baffled to the point that we called 911.  While we admitted to the officer who came out that we felt a little silly calling and that we had been drinking all night, we felt a burning need to let authorities know what we had seen. I checked wind direction for that time frame, and it was blowing South at 5 mph which pretty much discounts the possibility of chinese lanterns or flares.  I have absolutely no clue what these things could have been, and I feel very fortunate that I had friends with me to witness this.  We are all in our 30s and have careers in retail, insurance and teaching.  I am sharing this experience in the hopes that someone else saw these and can possibly explain what they were.  The random formations discount (to me) the possiblility of military aircraft, the wind direction rules out lanterns or flares, it was a clear night so they weren't reflections, and no trails tell me they weren't meteors.   Absolutely unexplainable, and the quantity made it somewhat of a scary experience.   For a brief time I wasn't sure if they would stop coming.

O ur lo;2011-12-15 00:00:00;15 seconds;My grandson and I was traveling south bound on I_85 from Charlotte, NC toward Atlanta, Ga on 12/15/11 sometime around 12:00 AM.  Our location was somewhere close to South Carolina and North Carlina line (?).   A row of 3 or so white lights appeared just in front of our vehicle approx 3 to 5 hundreds yards (?) away traveling at a smooth but very quick speed.  It crossed from left to right from a cell tower to another tower on other side of expressway.  It then proceeded to travel back across highway toward another cell tower further down the highway, then traveled south bound, following I-85 until it eventually dissappeared from our view on the horizon. It took about 12 to 17 seconds from first site to end of site.  No sounds, no hesitation, just a very smooth flight.  The row of lights never changed even though it moved from right to left then left to right, then traveling straight away from us.   I've never encountered anything like this before and has me checking the skies most nights.  I've searched online for sitings on this date but not found any such reports.   My grandson and I agreed the speed to be extremely fast due to the time it took to travel from our location to horizon, which we couldn't agree on.  He seemed to think the horizon was 50 or more miles away and I thought it could be no more than 10 miles away.   Even at 5 miles an object to travel that far in less than 12 to 17 seconds would be traveling at a very high rate of speed.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
3 Glowing Orbs glide across the night sky in triangle shape.;2012-01-06 21:15:00;1-2 Minutes;3 Glowing Orbs glide across the night sky in triangle shape. Friday, January 6th, 2012 Charlotte, NC 28209  	 A group of friends and I were playing a game of night Frisbee at the local middle school.  At approximately 9:15 pm someone shouted, Look up at the sky!  We all shifted out attention to the clear dark sky, where 3 balls of white light were swiftly gliding in perfect unison.  Even more bizarre, was how these foreign balls of light moved.  Not only did they glide with a solid white glow, (didn't flash like an airplane), they moved in a perfectly symmetrical equilateral triangle shape.  One light guided the other two across the sky, all of which appeared to be the exact same distance from one another, forming three perfect 45 degree angles. We were all dumbstruck by the phenomenon and attempted to make sense of it while continuing to admire its beauty.  Each of us announced our individual ideas in hopes of deriving a logical explanation for the triangles existence, whilst smothering the immediate idea that lingered in all of our hearts - could it be a UFO? 	Perhaps it just seemed too unlikely for us to be blessed enough to actually witness, first-hand, a true UFO sighting.  I remember watching the lights glide across the sky and debating whether or not to take a picture from my phone, not wanting to appear juvenile, I decided against it. After watching the lights glide for approximately one minute, the rear two lights began to reduce their distance apart from each other making the guiding light's angle (Far Right) more acute and the other two light's angles more obtuse (Left & Center).  The possibility that their paths were not predetermined by the front light (Far Right) began to cross our minds.  However, surely enough the rear lights settled into their new position and the three glowing lights maintained there new triangular shape and continued to travel across the night sky, once again, in perfect unison.  This proceeded for approximately 30 seconds.  Then, the far left light suddenly vanished from sight. The group burst into uproar, attempting to decipher the cause of the disappearance.  The consensus from the other witnesses was that it must have disappeared behind some clouds.  However, I was not convinced for two reasons. First, the sky appeared completely absent of clouds, no reflection from the moons glow indicated any cloudy haze whatsoever.  Secondly, even if it did disappear behind the clouds, eventually it would have reappeared - it never did. Approximately 15-20 seconds after the far left glow disappeared from sight, the front guiding light also disappeared (Far Right).  Leaving the last light to dwindle for approximately 20 seconds until it, too, disappeared.   The lights never revealed themselves to us again. One day later, a friend of ours who was at a neighboring mall the night of the occurrence, approximately 3-4 miles a way from our sighting, also saw the glowing orbs in the sky that night.  He took a picture of his findings and sent it to us it is the image that I have sent you. I researched the phenomenon somewhat and have found other sightings of these glowing orbs in the North Carolina area.  I hope that my story proved interesting, feel free to contact me about any questions you might have.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

My husband and I saw silent orange orbs of light in the sky.;2013-08-24 00:00:00;10 minutes;My husband and I saw silent orange orbs of light in the sky. My husband and I witnessed 30-40 orange orbs of light moving from north to south over eastern parts of Mecklenburg county.  They would disappear at a certain point in the sky.  The objects were totally silent.  The lights would get bright and dim.  They would pulsate.  My husband looked at some of the objects through binoculars and they appeared to be triangular in shape.  I called someone in the neighboring county to see if they could see the objects.  They saw flashes in the sky, but nothing else.  We called several news stations and no one reported anything.  The lights were moving in straight lines in no certain pattern at various heights above treeline in the sky.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Not to be confused with the Nibiru idea.  This does not resemble a second sun, but it looks like a star that just happens to be about 2-3 times larger than even the brightest star visible from here..not as large as the sun, or moon.  It stood out because I stare at the sky everyday into the evening and night and have never noticed it.  Apon watching it, I realized it was moving extraordinarily slow with the help of the trees as a reference.  It was not moving like a plane, or at plane speed, nor did it resemble a plane..or even a satellite.  I watched it for about 25 minutes and then it was just gone..not out of the line of sight, or over the horizon, but simply gone.   The next day it was there again.  And today it was there again.  At first I believed it was simply a star, but then upon research found that several people over the past week, or so have noticed it worldwide.  So far the only reports from the US have been from southern states.  Most reports from Australia and other countries.  There have been photos.  It appears to be more of a circular ripple rather than a 3 dimensional object.  There have also been infrared images of the sun with this thing showing up in them.  I do not believe it is Nibiru.  I'll try to find more on it, but as of now it still seems fairly new.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
11/03/16 15 white lights traveling west to east in Charlotte NC at 19:10. 2-3 minutes observing them;2016-11-03 17:10:00;2-3 minutes;11/03/16 15 white lights traveling west to east in Charlotte NC at 19:10. 2-3 minutes observing them In Charlotte, North Carolina (28227) at approximately 7:10pm, on Thursday, 11/03/16, my wife and I observed 15 white lights (circular) moving in formation and they appeared to be independent of each other.  They were no brighter than the surrounding stars.  They moved from the west going east (75 degrees WNW according to my cell-phone compass). They were directly overhead and appeared to us to be at an altitude of in-flight commercial aircrafts.  They traveled as fast as commercial planes at cruising altitude. There was no sound and they traveled in a straight path.  There was some position changing within the formation.  According to weather.gov, the wind was calm at 18:53 and 5 mph from the SW at 19:53.  Our observation was at 19:10. We did not feel or observe any wind. At first sight, I was alone. I saw 10 white lights (round) in a staggered row from left to right with 5 trailing in a 2-1-2 pattern.  I went to get my wife so she could see/confirm.  This took 15-20 seconds.  Upon our return outside, the staggered row contained 12 white lights and three were trailing in a 2-1 pattern.  They did not appear to blink, but periodically, a few would indiscriminately fade out then back to full glow.  This process took 2-3 seconds.  It was a clear, cloudless night.  The total observation took 2-3 minutes.  The lights were very similar to the lights videoed in Charlotte, NC, on 10/15 and posted to YouTube.    .   .   .   .                                            .    .     .    .   .   . .    .   .   .                                               .   .   .   .   .   . .    .                                                          .        . . .     .                                                             .

More than 100 flying objects of bright light.;2019-07-19 21:50:00;20 minutes;More than 100 flying objects of bright light. Friday, July 19, 2019 - At 9:50 PM EST, I was in the swimming pool at Post Ballantyne, when I saw a bright object, like a star (but three times bigger) or a satellite (four times bigger), flying north at about 15,000/20,000 feet.  I am always fascinated and very interested in flying objects, and I know that this was not a star, not a shooting star, not an airplane, not a drone and not a helicopter.  There was no engine sound.   A minute later a saw a second one, and then a third one, and a fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh.  Two minutes later I saw ten more, and ten more and then ten more.  Three minutes later I saw twenty more, and twenty more, and twenty more.  They were not flying in formation, rather randomly.  There were three other people with me in the pool, a man, a woman, and a child.  I asked them if they could see what I was seeing and they were totally surprised to see the flying objects.   We tried to take photographs with our phones, but they were too smal! l for the cameras.  The objects were flying in direction south to north, slightly west (5 degrees) from where we were.  They kept coming for the next 20 minutes.  Between 10:00 and 10:10 PM was the largest number of objects flying at one time.  Always flying at the same altitude, same direction, and same speed.  Then they started to decrees (contrary as they had started) until I saw the last one at about 10:20 PM.   I am a pilot and a keen observer of the sky, and I do not believe in UFOS, BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING very fascinating that I had never seen before.  Quite intriguing and fascinating. I need to investigate this event more and try to find a logical explanation, but if I do not find an explanation I feel I might become a believer in UFOS.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
