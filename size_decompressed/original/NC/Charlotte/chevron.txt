A near miss?;2004-07-04 16:45:00;10-15 seconds;A near miss? At 16:45 hours, I was sitting by the pool at the Autumn Park Apartments in Charlotte, NC, watching a De Havilland Dash 8 banking on a final approach to the Charlotte Douglas Airport, I observed a chevron shaped craft that looked at my vantage point to almost collide with the Dash 8. It seemed to come out of nowhere. It flew into my field of vision so quickly that it took me a second to focus on it. At first I thought the black chevron was a turkey vulture, but soon realized that it was flying too fast and dead straight, SW to NE. We were facing NE.  My wife has a compass on her key chain. The object was flying with a purpose. It made no noise. It took my wife awhile to see the object and by that time it was a black dot in the sky, heading in to the horizon. She thought it had to be a military or business jet because of the speed and the manner it was flying, but what I saw was too small and not shaped like any aircraft I know of and I can identify any type plane flying. The Dash 8 was about an inch long in the sky with my hand outstretched and my fingers apart. The object was about 1/8 to a Â¼ inch. It never deviated from its flight path and it seemed to me that it passed very close to the Dash 8. The sky was partly cloudy with two different cloud decks. The object and the airliner were both below the lowest cloud deck. I do not know the altitude the planes fly at that point from the airport. The distance is 12.5 miles due SW. The turbo props fly at a lower altitude than the jets.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Chevron shaped Grey Object seen hovering;2005-06-27 01:30:00;15 minutes;Chevron shaped Grey Object seen hovering I was out last night catching some fresh air on my back porch, when I saw an chevron shaped object seem to hover in the sky. Normally, I am very skeptical of such things, but I am postive it was not a airplane, helicopter of any sort. It hovered for about 5 minuetes then seemed to move behind some clouds for some time. It made no sound but was greyish in appearance with some thickness to its shape.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Faint chevron-shaped object over Charlotte, NC;2009-09-13 05:00:00;5 seconds;Faint chevron-shaped object over Charlotte, NC (09/13/2009, apx. 5 AM)  I was standing in front of my house.  Looking to the east, I saw what appeared to be sort of a bow or boomerang shape (135 degree angle) about two or three inches from tip to tip visual size.  It was dim, perhaps transparent I could barely make it out.  I just noticed the movement - it would have been easy to miss.  It did not have any details or color I could make out.  My impression was that it was anywhere from a few feet from tip to tip to maybe 10 feet.  It seemed to be around 50 to 100 ft. away, moving 10-20 mph.  The bow center or angle corner was the front.  It moved silently in a straight line towards the south or southeast.  It went behind the trees, and I didn't see it again after that.  The total duration of the sighting was about five seconds. I will admit that what I saw could have very well been an owl or something (or even a trick of the eyes, e.g. a floater), but I cannot be certain, so I thought it would not hurt to report it, especially since I witnessed a very similar phenomena a year or two earlier.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
