We  saw  what we thought was a  shooting star  very high in the evening sky. It then very quickly changed directions and increased its speed and sped away. Neither one of us could believe what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

It was very far away and about the size of a dime from our view point.  It crossed our horizen in about four minutes.  Moving much too fast to be an air craft. We were facing in a southwest ward direction. ((NUFORC Note:  It seems to us that a high-flying aircraft would be visible for the amount of time indicated by the witnesses.  However, we do not know what it was they witnessed.  A dime at arm's length is approximately the percieved size of a full moon.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Lost time;2001-06-19 22:30:00;15 mins / 2hrs?;Lost time I am writing this note after much anguish and deliberation.  I am not one to believe in this sort of thing, but the night of June 19 changed my life forever. I was driving down a road in the county coming home from a late night at work, when I thought I saw some lights over the trees in the distance.  I did not think too much about it, because I knew I was near the airport.  So I drove on for about 2 more miles, listening to my scanner.  Suddenly the channels started changing rapidly and the damn thing went nuts. Static, squeals, etc...  I was about to reach down and turn the thing off when the engine on my van quit.  The lights went out, and I rolled to a stop on the side of the road.  I tried and tried but the van would not start. I sat there for a moment, I got out my wireless phone, but it would not work, no signal nothing.  I was getting a bit pissed.  That is when I felt like I was being watched. Every hair left on my head stood straight up. Like when a baloon is rubbed on your head.  I heard a really loud noise, then nothing.  The van started, the scanner started too.  I had no idea what had happened, but I was tired and decided to go on home. When I got home, all the lights were out.  I went in and asked my wife why she went to bed so early. She said 'Early? It's 12:30!'.  Well I nearly fell over. I checked my watch and it said 10:45! I got really concerned that I had blacked out or something, but I have no history of this. Then I started thinking maybe I was abducted by aliens! Then I thought I must be nuts!  I have struggled with this incident for a couple of weeks. I cannot sleep, I cannot eat, I have strange dreams. I feel like I am losing my mind, So at the sueggestion of a friend, I decided to write you guys instead of just putting a bullet in my head. I cannot figure out what happened to those two hours. They are just gone..... I am not nuts, or on medications, but I feel like I am getting worse everyday... Please help! You can call me at work toll free if you like. 1-800-((number deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken briefly over the telephone with the individual who submitted the report.

Grayish object flying fast North to south over Independence Blvd;2007-09-02 23:39:00;5-7 seconds;Grayish object flying fast North to south over Independence Blvd On September 02, 2007, at 2339, I was looking up during a cigarette break at work, standing at the Carmax on Independence Blvd in Charlotte, NC.  There is a low to medium level of light pollution, and looking almost straight up under an overhang cuts out most of that.  I was outside about 5 minutes, and I was looking up, as I usually do at night, looking at constellations, and I happened to notice and watch a very high flying airliner flying approximately east to west.  I then noticed an object flying very fast approximately north to south.  It was a dark grayish shape, with a tiny spot of an orangish color that really seemed like a reflection of light versus an active light, and it was almost unnoticeable except for the movement.  I would say it was almost oval-ish.  It first appeared directly overhead, and was flying at a much higher rate of speed than I've seen any aircraft at a visible level.  It was going slow enough to follow it with the naked eye, however.  I first thought it might be a helium ballon due to the characteristics of appearing smaller but moving faster than a plane may.  However, there is no wind during this incident. I have no idea how high or the size of the object, but I would guess possibly 2000 feet up, possibly more, but no where near the height of the airliner.  It traveled in a straight line, jinked to the right similar to a bat would move, about 6-10 degrees, flew about a second on that heading, then jinked back to the left, again in the same instantaneous motion, a smooth, quick motion, while continuing on.  I would say from noticing it almost directly overhead, until I could not see it, lasted about 5-7 seconds.  I shouted at a coworker to look up, but they had just stepped out of hearing range at the time.  I am not taking any medication, do not drink, and have been at work about 6 hours when this happed, so I am fully awake and alert.  I called Charlotte Douglas airport and asked for a controller to ask if they saw anything, they replied the only thing they had was a plane flying around to land at the airport. I know there is no way this thing was a plane.  No flying lights, no blinking lights, the 2 smooth curves it made while flying.  If there was a helicopter that could angle that fast, I might believe that is what I saw, however there were no lights and I don't believe helicopters fly nearly that fast. I spent 10 years in the Air Force and have seen a few planes fly.  Nothing this fast, seemingly lower height, and the turns/curves it made.  Would like to hear if anyone else saw anything.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Two lights in the sky as the sun came up;2008-01-31 06:47:00;45 minutes;Two lights in the sky as the sun came up It was about 6:45 when I got off of the school bus then as I looked into the sky about SW i saw two lights in the sky. The objects were not moving. there was a big light then a smaller light wat sitting below the bigger light. As the sun came up I figured the light would go away if it was a star but as the sun came up the light got brighter. Then after about an hour the lights faded. I don't know exactly what it was but i was anything you normally see in the sky.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

I saw what appeared to be an airplane fall strait down from the sky about 4 mile's in front of me. As I traveled closer I realized that it had fallen in or around Mountain Island lake.  This object appeared to be an airplane because it had blue, red and white flashing lights.  However I was unable to determine the shape. Several motorist were pulled over near hwy 16 exit for Mountain Island lake and more on down.  There seems to be several wittiness.  Nothing on the news.  Also there were several aircraft in the area. One appeared to be following it at the time it went down. 9/13/10  12:31 or 9:31 PM;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

bright light or object moving rapidly across sky;2011-05-21 18:01:00;2 minutes;bright light or object moving rapidly across sky I had just parked my car and was heading to a bar for a friends birthday party, when I noticed a bright light in the sky.  Now with all this end of the world hooey going around I was starting to get a bit worried.  Then I realized this event probably wouldn't include me.  So I paid more attention to the object.  It was really fast and left no contrail, so I don't believe it was a plane.  I nearly had to lay down on the parking lot to keep a track on it!  It eventually moved out of my field of vision. I have never seen anything move that fast!  I am not a spring chicken and have seen a lot of stuff in my days, but this takes the proverbial cake.  I went on the party and didn't say a word about it... I am not sure what it was, but thought I'd report it.  Thanks for listening.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
4 bright orange balls with 3 smaller red balls with one of the bright balls flashing as if igniting.;2014-01-30 21:50:00;10 minutes after noticed;4 bright orange balls with 3 smaller red balls with one of the bright balls flashing as if igniting. I was on my way home and I noticed what I thought was a bright constellation I've never seen before.  There were four bright orange balls of light aligned in a similar shape as the cup of the big dipper, but were perfectly spaced apart making a much more symmetric shape.   Then I noticed three smaller lights, same color at first and slowly turned redder, in a triangle pattern inside of the cup pointing upwards (or pointing SE from where I was located).  The smaller lights disappeared and then the larger lights began to fade in and out until they were realigned as a straight line (SW - NE) with the second ball a bit lower than the rest but still evenly positioned from first and third ball.   Then the fourth ball began get really bright (looked momentarily like a fire ball igniting) and then changed to a blue color.  This happened a couple times until one by one the lights began to fade out.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Light formation near uptown Charlotte.;2015-08-21 21:18:00;2 minutes;Light formation near uptown Charlotte. My significant other and I saw a light formation flying from the area of uptown Charlotte, moving south, at about 9:15 p.m. Friday, August 21st.  We live just a few blocks outside of uptown.   The lights were spotted as they moved over an apartment building on the uptown side of the condo, and they flew directly over the condo.  There were a couple helicopters in the area at the time (due to a ruckus at a baseball game uptown that was occurring).  An airplane also flew by/below the light formation.   It took about two minutes from the time we spotted it over the next door building to the time it had disappeared over our building and was out of sight.   My SO grabbed binoculars and reported that the lights looked like discs with lights, but he also could not get the binoculars focused (I grabbed the iPhone).;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
