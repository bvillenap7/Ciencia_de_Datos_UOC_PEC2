The time was about 0030 hours. I was at work. I was parked at the intersection of The Plaza and Eastway Drive(Charlotte,NC). I was facing towards uptown Charlotte. I observed a very bright glowing green object(almost neon green) descending from the sky towards the ground. It was very fast. It disappeared behind the tree line in front of me. I observed it for only about 3-4 seconds. The object appeared to be a cylinder shape (in a upright position).  My window was down and I did not hear any sound. A friend of mine was parked next to me but facing the opposite direction. It happened so fast that by the time I could get any words out of my mouth, when he turned around it was over. It was without a doubt nothing from this planet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Bright White/Chrome Cylinder against Carolina Blue clear sky.;2009-04-09 08:12:00;about 6 minutes;Bright White/Chrome Cylinder against Carolina Blue clear sky. I stepped outside for some air and right there when I looked up was a White/Chrome Cylinder up in the air.  It was just North of where i was and it was at least 30,000 ft up and that guess is based off commercial air traffic that was passing through.  It could have been higher up, but I couldn't determine the size of it to gauge height. It was slowly moving from North to South and either Spinning or Wobbling.  Definitely was a Cylinder shape, and standing straight on end. After 30 Seconds of watching it it move about 14inches across sky in about 3 seconds. (Both Arms Extended Pointing, the Distance Between)  That put it @ my 1200 slightly West of me.   I ran inside and got a Co-worker to come and look.  When we returned it was still moving South and at about my 1100.  A Commercial Liner was passing by it when we returned.  Within 4 inches @ arms length, the Liner appeared roughly 30,000-40,000.  The Cylinder was about 1/3 the size of the Plane.  It continued to move South Wobbling or Spinning, it just looked slightly distorted.  It finally stopped @ our 1000 and just kind of stayed there, stopped for 20 Seconds or so, as 2 other Commercial Liners passed close by.  Then it just started slowly Wobbling/Spinning Due East.  It seemed to Fade in and Out when it was moving, but it was perfectly visible when still.   It eventually just disappeared.   Total Sighting time-6 minutes-0812 to 0818-it was a Clear Blue Sky with a little haze way off to our south.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Rotating Cylindrical object passes overhead.;2009-04-09 08:12:00;5-7 minutes;Rotating Cylindrical object passes overhead. While at work, my partner stepped outside to take a break.  Approx. 5 min. later in ran in and asked me to come outside.   When i stepped out onto the porch, he pointed to a Silver or White cylinder shaped object in the sky just North of our location moving at approx. 20 knots to the South.  Judging the altitude to be about 30-40,000 feet based on several passenger planes that were flying over at the time.  (I am not a big UFO watcher and somewhat skeptical, but todays sighting for me was the FIRST time I clearly saw an object that I knew wasn't a typical aircraft and for all intent and purposes shouldn't have been able to do what it did.)  While watching the cylinder, it continued South in a counter clockwise rotation or woble until turning East and then disappearing after about another minute.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Cylinder object with lights and green light and/or beam observed by family in Charlotte, NC.;2017-09-28 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Cylinder object with lights and green light and/or beam observed by family in Charlotte, NC. Observed what I thought was a drone, or satellite, 9/26, 9/27, 9/28 of this week.  I started taking pictures and the object would move as I was taking the the shots in fast short movements, almost triangle pattern.   The object had lights that would come on and off when another aircraft flew nearby.   When I started to review my pics, I have a green bar or laser coming down from object in distance in one shot, and in others when object right over head the green light is focused on me.  The object has been over our house all week includingl last night.  I have pictures and video and need someone to help explain this.   I made my wife and our 14 son come out and see last night..they noticed it turn lights out when commercial plane came close;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
