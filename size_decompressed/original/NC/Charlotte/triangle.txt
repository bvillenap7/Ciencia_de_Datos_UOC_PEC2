I spotted two triangular craft over the treetops........;1997-10-26 22:00:00;few seconds;I spotted two triangular craft over the treetops........ I was in my car with a friend. It was about 10:00p.m. when I decided to put in a cd rather than listen to the radio. I was fooling with the stereo when two triangular crafts just above the treetops caught my attention. You must understand that the view I received didn't allow for more than a glimpse. The crafts had amber colored lights on every angle of them. And you could barely make out the shape of them because they blended in with the rest of the night sky. Their size was about 100 feet across. Speed must have been about 35 m.p.h. No noise was heard. It's funny cause when I spotted them I said, What's that?! Do you see that?! and my friend said they were just helicopters. They floated right above the treetops very slow and all I caught was a glimpse.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

As other aircraft flew above from local airport, objects seemed to be at a altitude that high flying jets take. No sound, or exhaust. 3 dark in color objects moving in a loose formation N. As other aircraft flew above, objects seemed much higher and distant.... seemed to be at a altitude that high flying jets take. No sound, or exhaust. Seemed to keep same shape..but angle of objects changed as they began to excel gradually in speed and continue to climb at an angle until fading out of sight. Witnesses are professional middle & late aged. One did not know what to make of it. The other thought it might be bats. At first I thought so to, however focusing on the objects for about 30 seconds and looking at the skyline and other aircraft in the area, they seem to be much higher than any bat I ever saw. Also, the objects had smooth movement throughout the event. Was hard to focus continuously due to work activities for the duration the objects appeared in the sky. My best guess at this point is military stealth type aircraft, or some type of bird???.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Silent craft floated over my head;2000-05-10 22:00:00;15 minutes;Silent craft floated over my head hi, I saw a UFO the other night when I was riding my bike to the store to get some beer.  It was a clear night and I had just left the store and  was enjoying the ride back home when I felt like I was being watched. And I noticed some of the street Iights went out and on kinda flickering all up and down the road. I just  kept on peddling, cause if you are black at night and in my  neighborhood, you just don't stop.  Anyway, I finally got tired of wondering and looked back., and damn if I didn't just about ((deleted)). There was this huge((deleted)) thing in the sky, black and silent. It was a floating just about 300 feet up or so, and sort of swinging from side to side. No lights, no sound. Just like a big ((deleted)) balloon about 100 feet across. Triagle looking, solid, blacker than me.   I don't have any notion what that ((deleted)) was.  All I know is I never ever saw anything like it.  I heard about this kinda stuff but I just used to laugh. Well, not now!  I dropped the bike, the beer, started hoofin it down the street. When I got home my wife thought I had a run in with some of the neighborhood ((deleted)), cause I was sweating ((deleted)) when I came in. I just went straight to the shower and sat down. I cried ((deleted)) for  about an hour. Then I pulled myself together, and wrote down as much detail as I could. So I could tell someone.  Here it is. I hope you don't think I am on crack or something, I ain't never touched the devils chicklets and I never will.  So this is straight up on the one.  It happened.  Stone cold fact. I thank you for you time.((name deleted));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
3 independent bright lights form a triangular pattern...2 UFOs speed off and leave 1 that comes and goes...we have pics and video!;2003-01-06 19:00:00;Off and on for 1 hour;3 independent bright lights form a triangular pattern...2 UFOs speed off and leave 1 that comes and goes...we have pics and video! I was coming home from my girlfriend's house around 7pm this evening.  I came up my road (there's a hill on my street) and I see this triangular formation of three (3) extremely bright, round lights up in the sky about 200 feet up and a mile or so away.  I jumped out of my car, ran in to tell my mother and she ran out and we both stood in our back yard staring at the lights.  They hovered in the sky without moving for about 2 minutes.  After about 2 mins, the lower UFO in the triangle drifted up and to the right towards one of the other UFO's...once it got close, the upper right UFO flew off out of sight at an incredible speed.  The UFO on the other side did the same after that.  The one UFO was left hovering in the sky, the bright light kind of twinkling.  The single UFO came and went off and on for the next hour, making random zig-zag floating actions in the sky.  My father came home later the night and saw it too, he said Oh my God!!! I thought you guys were joking.. - The weird thing is that it was sooooo windy that night, and the whole entire sky had a sort of pale amber tint to it.  Our gate in the back yard kept slamming shut and my mom told me that earlier in the day she had heard a very loud noise around where the lights were coming from.  The pets were acting weird.  The objects were not moving at all times, so they were definetely not airplanes...but they were close enough that if they were helicopters we would have definetely heard them.  Plus, any type of aircraft I've ever seen is not capable of dissapearing out of sight in the amount of time that these did.  Very spooky, something strange is definetely going on over Charlotte, NC.  This is no hoax, we have pictures and video.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Triangle shaped object with 3 round lights;2003-11-03 21:00:00;30 seconds;Triangle shaped object with 3 round lights I was star gazing around 9:00 pm on the back deck of my home.  I looked straight up and saw 3 round lights moving in unison from the West to the East horizon.  The circles of grey light were located at each end of the triangle shape, and I estimate this triangle was about 100 feet across.  I looked away from the lights several times to make sure I was really seeing what I saw.  I was able to locate this moving object over and over again.  It took about 30 seconds for this object to move to the Eastern horizon.  This was no illusion!  I went to bed and dreamed of UFO's darting in and out of the clouds and across the sky.  These UFO's in my dream were both triangle shaped and rod shaped. ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE/09MR04)) Dear Peter,   Thanks for all you do.  I check your site daily for updates and it's fascinating reading.   I witnessed a ufo November 2, 2003, and reported it to you and it is posted in the database.  Since my sighting I have slowly come to realize that this ufo departed/exited in a very distinctive manner.  At around 9pm I saw three circles of gray light that were much higher than the typical commercial air traffic around Charlotte, NC.  They were in a triangle formation moving west to east.  I strongly believe they were separate from each other as I remember seeing the stars between/behind them as they progressed across the sky.  They were much larger than any star or commercial airline lighting.  Using the thumb measure, each circle was size of a pencil eraser.   When the three circles approached the eastern most horizon the first circle appeared to curl up like it was going through an evelope slot or like it was curling upward around a cylinder or wringer of some sort.  I remember watching it curling and then all three lights went out or disappeared.  I wonder if this could be some sort of portal these crafts use to leave earthly dimension.  Forgive me if this account is of no use but I wanted to report it just in case you feel it truly is distinctive.  I also attached a rudimentary picture of the ufo that I drew on my Dell.   Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  Graphic image shows three white circles in the sky, oriented in a triangular fashion.  PD));35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Triangle ship seen;2012-03-26 21:57:00;2 minutes;Triangle ship seen I was walking my dogs around 9: 50 Pm in the evening for their last run.  Noticed in the north direction there were flashing lights of greenish blue, white and red blinking lights.   At first I thought it was a plane but as it came closer, there were no sounds and the lights didn't appear to be of those on airplanes.   As it came closer passing over my house, I noticed its shape to be triangular with a white light on the tail point.  It was not going fast but not too slow either.   Was kind of shock to see its shape as a triangle with hardly no sounds at all.   Everyone knows what the plane sounds like and this had hardly no sound at all.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Red Lights Over East Meck High;2012-04-28 21:00:00;40 seconds;Red Lights Over East Meck High After a 9-10 year old football game we were coming out of the lights on the field,  3 red lights were spotted in a triangular, then a straight line pattern above and could not have been too high as a low cloud cover had rolled in.  The front light went out first then the rear light followed by the middle.  They all stayed stationary and there was no noise detected.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Black triangle 36 sighted in backyard early AM that leaped from ground to higher branch or line.;2012-07-13 03:27:00;9-10 seconds;Black triangle 36&quot sighted in backyard early AM that leaped from ground to higher branch or line. On July 13, 2012 at 3:27am while taking my dogs out to the backyard for an unexpected bathroom visit, I saw a black triangular shaped about 36inches from the top of the triangle to its base, go from the ground level to a high branch or just away….  My Golden Retriever approach the area of &quotfly-up&quot very slowly, sniffing the aire and walking very slowly.   My German Shepherd at the same time was slowly approaching the area looking upwards and moving in a questioning manner. It was very dark outback, however I had flipped on the back lights, that lit up the yard for me watch the dogs from the porch.   And, I was on the porch frozen and quizzled as to what in the world I had just seen.  I have questioned different people about what this could possibly be.   A large owl, osprey were the answers.  I have bird watched quite a bit and know my silhouettes.   This shape does not match any bird descriptor I have referenced or observed.  There were no flapping wings or wing spread nor was there a tail visible.  I did find however, bird feathers of birds possibly consumed. It's the triangular shape that has me puzzled.  And, the power this thing had to have to leap to a higher branch or line.  I stayed on the porch frozen while my dogs continued to sniff and look upwards.  They finally gave up did their business and came in.  I could not sleep all thinking about what this thing could be.  When I question or tell other people about this experience I am laughed at or brushed off with a silly look or remark.  I know what I saw.  And, if the dogs could talk they would back me up!;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

At least 15 unidentified orange objects in the night sky.;2015-05-06 21:09:00;2.5 minutes;At least 15 unidentified orange objects in the night sky. At 23:09 my dog was barking and alerted my attention to the sky with her growling. I then went outside and saw that there were at least 15 triangle shaped orange colored objects against a dark sky on the Eastern side. The objects were flying in an arch formation and some of them started disappearing behind the clouds. They were all the same color and shape, and moving quite slowly.  The objects were close to each other, and silent. When I grabbed my phone to take a picture, there were only 4 objects left in the sky. I cannot see the objects on the camera phone clearly.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058

Driving down E independence toward uptown Charlotte around 11:50 pm, I saw 3 orange/yellow lights in a triangle….it was a lot bigger than a plane and seemed a lot lower than a plane would fly and there was no sound that I heard. I have never seen anything like this and I was so freaked out I wish I could go back because I should have pulled over and filmed it.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Bright orange orbs.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-13 06:12:00;>20 minutes;Bright orange orbs My son was outside waiting for his school bus to come and he called me and said “Mommy, remember the thing we saw last year on July 4th?  Well, it’s outside again. I was in shock, and immediately told him that I was going to look outside from my bedroom window to see if I can see it.  I saw it and told him I was going to call him back, since I had to record it on my phone.   I looked and saw the orange orbs.  It was getting brighter, then it would fade, then reappear. I saw it was getting closer to where I saw an outline of a triangle and I started to get scared because this was the closest I have seen it and I do not want to see it that close because it creeps me out.   I had to get ready for work so I had to stop looking outside.  I went back to look out the window and it was back again.  Outside was getting lighter and I saw it and recorded it.  I recorded it 3 separate times on my phone. This is the second time we have seen this in our neighborhood.

Triangle yellow lights in the night sky.;2018-11-20 19:50:00;4 minutes;Triangle yellow lights in the night sky. I have a four-year degree and am working on my Masters degree.   I was traveling up I-85 in-between Charlotte and Salisbury, traveling north-east.  As I was driving, I was looking periodically into the sky at the numerous airplanes with their flashing lights.  Almost 6-8 airplanes were flying and moving in all directions across the sky in different directions.   Then as I look up again, I see 2 lights beside each other straight ahead in the sky and at first, I thought they were just stars because they were not moving or flashing, but I could notice they were brighter than any star in the night sky.  As I got closer it seemed to be getting bigger and was not really moving but seemed to be hovering, almost as if it was studying the nearby airport.  It looked to be roughly 5 miles in the sky right in front of the road.   As I moved closer to it in the car, I could see vividly the 2 lights were now 3 in a triangle. They were a yellowish orange light and still at this point, were not flashing like all the other airplanes in the night sky.  As I drove almost directly under it, I could tell it wasn’t moving or moving extremely slowly, as I saw the triangle of yellow-orange lights that looked to be about the size of two airplanes given the distance.   When we passed underneath it I looked back for a second it looked to be getting smaller and moving higher and away at about a 70 degree angle.  I’m not sure what I saw but it was not acting like, nor looked like any of the other half a dozen airplanes in the night sky.   The 3 bright yellowish orange lights seemed to take up more than half of the bottom of the craft.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
Large dark, triangular UFO with three white lights on corners was seen hovering without movement or sound at night near Charlotte, NC.;2021-05-20 22:25:00;3 minutes;Large dark, triangular UFO with three white lights on corners was seen hovering without movement or sound at night near Charlotte, NC. Driver was traveling south in her vehicle on Interstate 77 near intersect of Interstate 485 just north of Charlotte, NC, half way between Charlotte and Huntersville, NC.  At 10:25 pm (22:25 pm) on May 20, 2021. One large triangle shaped smooth/sleek object with three bright white (LED) lights on each corner was seen in the sky at approximately the height from the ground of 3-4 full grown oak trees tall.  It was dark in color (black or dark silver gray) and appeared to have a smooth undersurface, which is what was in view of this driver.  There was no sound and it remained stationary (hovering) in place without movement.  The three corners of the object appeared to be somewhat rounded. (Difficult to determine some details as it was very dark outside.) Reminded driver of the smoothness/sleekness and shape of a Stingray, somewhat sci-fi or futuristic in appearance.  The large size of this object appeared to be similar to or slightly larger than a commercial a! irline carrier (Jumbo Jet), only a solid large triangular shape rather than a slender body with wings.;35.200603478896;-80.8322199283058
