Three orange lights moving in unsion.;2014-05-02 21:44:00;2 minutes;Three orange lights moving in unsion. I was driving home and initially saw two lights together just above the trees.  At first I thought they were the tops of radio or cell phone towers, which surprised me as I had never seen lights there before. Still travelling, I turned and went across a long bridge on Old US 421 across the Yadkin River.  I then could see three total lights heading approximately North to Pfafftown/King.  I pulled over to take a photo with my iPhone 4 and made a phone call while I watched till they vanished. They were all three identical in size, color, and shape from my vantage point. Orange in color and flickering slightly. They moved together in what appeared to be a triangular formation. The apparent magnitude would be similar to a meteor entering the atmosphere, bright and OBVIOUS in the sky compared to the stars. You couldn't help but look at them. The angular diameter was that of maybe a low flying aircraft light at night. Again, much larger than a star. All three moved in sequence, at what appeared a slow velocity, in the same direction.  I got out of my truck and heard no noise (I was listening for engine or propeller sounds).   It was almost impossible to gauge the altitude, but if I could guess, maybe 14,000 feet.  There were sporadic high altostratus clouds in the sky. I'm a former US Marine, full time city firefighter, and hold a Bachelor's degree in physics.;36.2014;-80.5241
