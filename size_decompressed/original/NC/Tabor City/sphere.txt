A month ago, I saw a glowing orange orb moving really quickly across the sky. It then maneuvered in a way that I’ve never seen, disappearing behind a tree-line. I’m able to quickly identify things in the sky. I didn’t know what this was. I also didn’t report this original event.&#8232&#8232 My wife and one of my children have witnessed the same or similar object in the sky, on separate occasions. Last night, around 9pm, I noticed two orange lights in the distance. I originally thought they might be planets, because they weren’t moving and looked different than the stars. I kept watching. One of the objects moved very quickly from its stationary position and was quickly out of sight. There was a tree-line near me that obstructed my ability to continue tracking it. The second object began to move slowly, in a direction similar to the first and was quickly out of sight. I thought that the event was very strange.  I went into the house and sat down. 5-10 minutes after I sat down, the house was buzzed by a low flying, fast moving, jet.  It was followed by a second low flying jet.  Based on the sound, I could tell that the jets were moving towards where the orange lights had been.  This could have been a coincidence, but was also strange. I spent 9 years in the military, stationed on an airbase.  I’m very familiar with aircraft in the sky.;34.1219;-78.8271
