Immediately upon pulling out of our store's parking lot, my attention was drawn to a bright orange light moving across the sky.  It was somewhat close to the Moon at first.  My eyes were glued to its position, because this was no plane or helicopter.  I could tell by its movement which was obviously free of any particular direction.   Then, after a few seconds, the light turned off as it swooped down at an incalculable speed. It flew directly over my car and I saw a grey, squared shaped craft with a dark circle on the bottom.  However, it was flying in the opposite direction from where I was driving, so I lost sight afterwords.  I have witnessed orange lights a few other times in this area recently, but this experience was the closest.  Most visually apparent an unknown craft has made itself to me.;35.5886;-77.1452
