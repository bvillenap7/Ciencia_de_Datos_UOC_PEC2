An incredible sight of a saucer flying through the night sky with a reddish/orange vapor trail that dissappeared.;2013-01-27 21:25:00;~1 minute;An incredible sight of a saucer flying through the night sky with a reddish/orange vapor trail that dissappeared My boyfriend and I were on our way home from visiting our parents who live in Belhaven, NC.  We live in Greenville, NC.  We were coming into Washington, NC when right above the tree-tops there was a flying object.  It was maybe 100-200ft up in the sky.  It was around 9:25PM and we watched it for a minute or less. It was flying from right to left.  It was something unbelievable.  At first we thought it was a plane but they have never and wouldn’t fly that low over the Washington area.  We live by an airport and could learly tell it wasn’t a plane.  It was cloudy tonight so if it was an airplane, we shouldn’t have been able to see it. It appeared to be silver in color and was more oval or the typical “UFO” shape.  It was flying incredible fast, faster than any airplane I have ever seen.  It had lights that could have been underneath of it but they looked more along the sides and on the middle of the craft.  The lights were different colors of white, yellow, and red.  They didn't have a synchronized pattern in their flashes either and they all flashed at different times.  It seemed to have a reddish/orange vapor trail following. When it got toward the 1 minute mark it just seemed to vaporize and it was gone.  We can only believe that it was a UFO and it was amazing.;35.5886;-77.1452
