LOW LIGHTS AND STRANGE OBJECT(S)  IN RURAL AREA AGAIN!  UNMISTAKEABLY STRANGE.;2005-02-17 20:30:00;2-3 minutes;LOW LIGHTS AND STRANGE OBJECT(S)  IN RURAL AREA AGAIN!  UNMISTAKEABLY STRANGE. We all saw white and green lights and an orange light.   My son's girlfriend was being picked up by her father.  We were all talking when I noticed lights to the south of our home in the dark, hilly area we live in rural NC.  It is the same area and direction we have seen two other unidentified sightings.  This time 5 of us saw it.   These lights appeared about 3/4 of a mile from our home.  Our home is up on a hill and down below is one other home with only a yard light.  These lights were beyond that home but in front of the next ridgeline.  There are no roads leading to that area, only timber land.   These white lights seemed to be coming closer towards us, still from a distance and then the lights appeared to be coming on up and down vertically, two sets side by side, very tall seeming, when we then saw green ones and then an orange one.   Then they started to fade into the west.  I went for my camera and tried to take a digital photo but it only shows a white light in the distance before it was comletely out of sight.  We have a yard light in the same direction, to the left, but this light was lower than that.  That tells us how low this thing was.   None of us can describe what it might have been but something definitely was there, AGAIN!  Could have been several objects but it is undeterminable due to the distance, however, the lights were unmistakeable and VERY STRANGE for a rural town.;35.2273;-79.9822
