14-16 lights moving in different directions but made 90 degree turns. ((Starlink satellites?));2019-12-19 17:04:00;3 minutes;14-16 lights moving in different directions but made 90 degree turns. Witnessed 10-16 lights when while on the bridge at 17:04 only caught 2 with my camera while driving.  The lights came down like something burning up in the atmosphere but then they made 90 degree turns. The lights made different movements. No sound from air craft, weather was clear and this occurred at dusk. The lights disappeared at different times. Whole event a few minutes I pulled after the bridge I pulled off the road and captured the remaining two lights.  The light was consistent throughout could not make out any objects.;36.0756;-75.7944
