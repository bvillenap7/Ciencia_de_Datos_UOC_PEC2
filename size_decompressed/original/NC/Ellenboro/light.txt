Ball of light moving across the sky in a zig-zag motion.;2012-08-16 21:30:00;5-7 minutes;ball of light moving across the sky in a zig-zag motion One summer night myself & 3 others where sitting out in the back yard near a bonfire looking at the stars. That night i saw the big & small dippers & orions belt & many others then i spoted a ball of light going across the sky to the left & it was going in an zag-zag pattern (like a heart rate monitor)   We watched it moving around for several mins just going across the sky.  I tryed to record it but my camera wasn't good enough to follow it cause it was going to fast for it & then it just disapeared.
