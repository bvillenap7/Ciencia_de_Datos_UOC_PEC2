Slow moving White lights moving from north to south.;2009-12-22 22:45:00;10 minutes;Slow moving White lights moving from north to south. Referencing the following report:  Occurred : 9/20/2009 22:45 (Entered as : 09/20/2009 22:45) Reported: 9/26/2009 4:42:31 PM 16:42 Posted: 12/12/2009 Location: Lexington, NC Shape: Circle Duration:2 hours + [Narrative excluded]  As a resident of Lexington, NC I have often seen similar objects that appear quite stationary in the sky, and then move ... in a specific direction .... Northeast to Southwest or reverse.   Depending upon atmospheric conditions the light may appear bright white or blue .. again also depending upon the aircraft. There is also a famous Vineyard in the area and the owner employs a Lear Jet in his travels - often flying low.  No noise is heard until the aircraft is close or passes overhead.  The local airport is nearby and low approach speed maintains an optical illusion of a non-moving object when approaching HEAD ON to the viewer.. Lexington also falls under a main sky route hub between Greensboro/Winston-Salem and Charlotte and it is not unusual for heavy air traffic .... the planes often employ landing strobes .. but the actual ONCOMING path makes it appear stationary until they get overhead and then one can see the FAA required aircraft lights (i.e. green/red .... varied blinking lights, wing lights, etc.) . Many others have seen similar objects and mistook them for ... Unidentified, until that typical jet noise catches up. I am not sure if this applies to the above situation, but may be a possible explanation. This evening I have seen many .... heavy air traffic ... some small aircraft ... strobes are flashed when they are approximate to each other.  TWO in particular were unusual and did NOT follow the normal flight route however I had assumed that they were the result of heavy inbound/outbound air traffic (Holiday) and may have been put on a holding pattern.  The night was very clear, the aircraft did NOT make noise, but assumed (again) the sound would follow.  It didn't however the movement was consistent with usual flight speed with no deviations from a straight course, nor any change in speed.  Both objects moved from NORTH to SOUTH, EACH about ten minutes apart - EACH taking about ten minutes to cross.  The ONLY thing unusual were that there were NO FAA lights .. just a solid white light. Note:  Many dogs in the area were howling during this ... particular sighting. Nothing follows, nor is follow-up necessary.  Reported FYI only.;35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
