Did not see them when craft was approaching, only its red flashing lights, but as it went over the top and just past, I seen the two white orbs that looked equally spaced and almost uniform with the helicopter all where going slowly towards the east out of sight.  Not exactly sure what it was just that it was strange.  May have been a drone.  Not sure if military helicopters escort drones. ((NUFORC Note:  We doubt that drones are often accompanied by helicopters.  PD));35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
