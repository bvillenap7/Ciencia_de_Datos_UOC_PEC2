I thought it was a star until it moved quickly northward.;2009-09-20 22:45:00;2 hours +;I thought it was a star until it moved quickly northward. I was looking out my bathroom window Sunday night about 10:45 pm and noticed a brightly twinkling star in the sky, it turned a bluish color and suddenly moved northward then returned to original position and then started moving slightly downward toward earth and then back to original position.  I was mezmarized and continued to watch for another 20 min or so, it began to slowly move south with circular patterns.  I stopped watching for about an hour and then returned to the window, it had moved much more southward but about the same height in the sky.  Whatever it was it was not a plane or helicopter, it could stay stationary for minutes then move quickly up down, and around, The light was very bright and was mostly bluish but occationally yellow. It didn't seem to be in a hurry like it was just there moving around. I stopped  watching about 12:30-1am and it was still out there moving around in the sky.  I'm in my 50's and have never seen anything quite like this, made me feel very uneasy.;35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
White flying object circling star, zipped off, chased by jets, then shot at jets.;2012-02-20 07:50:00;A few minutes;White flying object circling star, zipped off, chased by jets, then shot at jets. I was outside, when I noticed something moving up in the sky, I thought it was a plane, but when I looked up, it looked REALLY high up, looked like another star, and it was moving around another star, no blinking lights, after a few seconds,  It zipped off, Next thing I know, at least 5 jets/planes were going straight in its direction, in less than 30 seconds, about 10-15 planes were flying around. I was just watching, when next thing I know,  What looked like a shooting star came flying away from the direction the UFO came from, shot directly towards the planes/jets,  The object seemed to appear out of nowhere, and then disappear out of nowhere,  When the UFO Zipped off, from my perspective it looked to be going 100-150 MPH, and the object it shot seemed to be going twice that.   The UFO was Bluish/Whitish, and the object it shot was white.;35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
Glowing circular object with dark blue ring falling from the sky;2018-12-26 22:00:00;2 seconds;Glowing circular object with dark blue ring falling from the sky Driving on  I-85 North my husband and I saw a glowing blue circular object fall from the sky.  Not a shooting start.  I have seen one of those.  Hard to explain, of course, but it was glowing similar to the moon.  It had a bluish white center with a pretty darker blue ring.   Seemed to fall in a circular motion (like something being thrown) rather than straight out of the sky.;35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
