Hovering Light Over NC.;2019-04-21 23:00:00;Intermittent activity for;Hovering Light Over NC I have seen a UFO before, but never one that moved like this one did. Around 11:00 PM, I was outside.  The night was clear, almost electric.  I could see stars twinkle, and then from the south, I noticed something moving, with no blinking lights.  It appeared almost to be on “autopilot “.  It moved slowly enough that I could keep my eye trained on it until it  went past the tree line in the distance to the north east.  No sound whatsoever.  It did, however, appear to emit a spotlight of sorts?  That’s the best way I can describe it.   After I’d lost sight of it, I noticed what were clearly man made aircraft traveling in the direction of the unknown craft one man made craft on either side of the unknown craft.   Whatever it was, was in no hurry to get anywhere and was not afraid to be conspicuous.  It flew low enough that I could see a solid, white or yellow light on the belly of the craft.   Almost like a submarine, only flying.  All I know is that it was an unidentifiable flying aircraft to me.  I know it was something that other people have seen, as well.;35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
