Night siting of a black trangle;1979-04-15 21:00:00;5 t0 8 minutes;Night siting of a black trangle The date I have given for the actual siting is approximate simply because it was so long ago, but the time is accurate. It was early sping and I remember this because the trees were just starting to bud and the nights were finally begining to warm up. My cousin and I were doing what we usually did at 15 on a weekend night by riding our bikes to the next street off of Main street to sit by the railroad tracks to watch the frieght trains go by. It was a cloudless night with no wind. We were sitting on a concrete foundation connected to a warehouse just off the road about 60 or 70 feet from the railroad crossing watching cars slowly go across the double rail lines. We were hoping for a slow moving train to come by so we could throw rocks at the rail cars and see the sparks fly. That happened a time or two and we found ourselves sitting there as it got later looking at the sky. We were talking and I noticed in the sothwest a blinking out of stars as I gazed at the sky. I didn't think anything about it at first because I was looking at the sky through a tree in the distance. I just thought the limbs of the tree might be moving because of a slight breeze that I could not feel from where I was sitting. A few more minutes passed as I watched the blinking out continue above the tree. Then I realized something was strange and I asked my cousin if he could see it. I had to point in the direction and he saw what I was talking about. We just watched as it approached about 30 degrees above the horizon and that was when we realized it was a moving solid object. It had no lights at all and actually was darker than the moonless sky. I remember saying to my cousin at that point, what is that? He said I don't know. It was almost overhead by now and was being underlit to some extent by the lights on Main street. It was a perfect triangle and looked to be fairly low in altitude. Maybe 600 to 800 hundred feet and about about 3 inches between the forefinger and thumb at arms lenght.  I ran out to the rai! lroad tracks to get a look at it as it passed over the two story warehouse and I lost it in the city lights. At that point I don't remember us saying a word but we both jumped on our bikes and sped to my parent's house about a 1/4 mile away where my cousin spent the night. There was no noise and the speed of the object was constant, very slow and linear. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
Black gliding air craft, blue and red light at the end of  wings, flying low.;2013-04-23 22:00:00;1 minute;Black gliding air craft, blue and red light at the end of  wings, flying low Object was flying very low, the only thing you could see about it however was blue and red lights that were on the ends of what are assumed to be wings.  It was wasn't flying, so much as it was gliding.  It was different then any aircraft I had ever seen.  It was also much quieter then any typical place, which also struck me as odd.;35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278

I know this because I could see the edges of the craft. It had 3 bright lights located at each point of the triangle.  The object disappeared behind a cloud.  Within five minutes, I saw two helicopters, and quite a few planes (way more than normal), head into the same direction the craft or object disappeared;35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
