I was sitting in my backyard on a small patio petting my dog when a very dimly light object about the size of a tennis ball/racquetball flew in a straight line just a few feet over my rooftop through the backyard out of site into the trees.  The backyard is about a half acre deep to a fence line which adjoins to a cow pasture.   It is about 50 - 75 feet before the tree line begins in the cow pasture.  Not a bird as it had no wings and was utterly silent.  It did not lose any altitude and was so dimly lit that it disappeared as soon as it passed over.  It seemed to have a very fine, thin trail at least 25+ ft that also dissolved into thin air.  Very eerie experience. I have never seen anything that substantial in size fly in such a straight pattern so quietly in the dark.;35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
