Yellow fireball object, viewed from lexinton, NC;2005-11-15 19:23:00;45 to 55 sec;Yellow fireball object, viewed from lexinton, NC I was on my way to pick up my son from karate class and while driving I was on the phone talking to my mother. All of a sudden I saw a fireball in the sky It appear going the same direction I was going and I thought a meteorite but as soon as I finishe my thought it stopped...I started to scream on the phone to my mom I have to stop (several times), I stopped and it went down to the left it disappear from my sight (there were trees)for a a second or two. I was static... and I saw it again coming up to the same point in the sky where it had stopped. It was big I put my fist against the fireball shape and I still could see the edges of it It started moving to the right in a downward direction...same thing happened it disappear from my sight (there were trees) for a a second or two. This time it appeared moving horizontally from right to left and that was it I did not see it again. I waited about 20 minutes just in case but I had to leave and pick up my son (needles to say I was late picking him up). I must have put the Mobile phone down because when I pick it up from the passenger seat my mom was so worried she thought I was in some kind of danger. She said I was saying  oh my god! oh my god!... what the heck is that?...it is here again...where is it going? what is it doing? why is my body tingling (like electricity) I felt like that for a couple of hours (It must have been my adrenaline). I could not appreciate how far it was from my position because it was dark...I think probably a mile or 2.;35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
