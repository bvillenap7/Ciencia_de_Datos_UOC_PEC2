STATIONARY FLASHING LIGHT.;2006-04-01 21:15:00;25 mnutes;STATIONARY FLASHING LIGHT We were star gazing on the evening of Saturday April 1, 2006 when it dawned on us that there was a flash of light located south of the constellation Leo that was about the size of a typical star.  The flash of light had a frequency of between 15 to 30 seconds and appeared to be the same color of a strobe light.  It varied in magnitude from bright (like that of a magnitude -1 star) to dim (like that a magnitude +3 or higher star) and was generally stationary, displaying occaisional slight varience from time to time.  We observed this phenomenon for close to 25 minutes.  Although we were using both a pair of binoculars and a telescope in our stargazing, we could only sight the object in the pair of binoculars. ((NUFORC Note:  Over recent years, we have received a number of reports that are similar to this one.  We have no idea what the cause of the light;35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
