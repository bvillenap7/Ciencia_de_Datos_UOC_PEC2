green oval shaped light over my local church,power lines down..;1971-10-10 21:00:00;30 seconds;green oval shaped light over my local church,power lines down.. it was saturday night in late in october i think.i was around 9 or 10 years old. me and my mom were headed to the church we attended to turn the heat on for the next mornings service. she had forgotten to earlier that day when we cleaned the church as we always did on saturdays. anyway,we pulled into the circle drive and noticed the power lines had been cut right in the middle of the driveway. as we pulled in to observe a oval shaped light green object went across the sky down behind some trees.it startled both of us and we left. the next morning before church we had no electricity either. the electric line had been cut at the house beside our house and laying across the neighbors driveway. the strange thing about it was that our neighbor was a preacher of another church a few miles down the road. the power line had been cut there as well. there were only 3 diffrent places that i am aware the lines had been cut. that was at my church,my neighbors who was a pastor,and the lines at his church. his church was a methodist and ours was a baptist. both churches had the same first name. one ended with methodist,the other with baptist. i don't know if this had anything to do with the light we saw,but it sure was weird for me as a child. i remember it as if it were yesterday. i am 47 now. this is a very true story.

My Aunt, Uncle, and myself witnessed an oval UFO while traveling in Uncles car.;1973-07-14 20:00:00;5 minutes;My Aunt, Uncle, and myself witnessed an oval UFO while traveling in Uncles car. I was a passenger in my aunt and uncle's car and we were either driving to or returning from (I thougnt we were going out to eat and aunt says we were on our way back from) Winston Salem NC, where we were going out to eat.  We were on old Winston Rd. when my uncle slowed the car down,  this got my attention.  There were several cars in front of ours that was also stopped.  Directly in front of us and located above the trees was this hugh UFO.  It was metal in color.  It had round windows all around the craft with light coming out of it, several colors. It was silent.  It defied physics in that it stayed perfectly still, as it set in the air just above the trees, centered over the two lane road we were on.  In moments, it lifted up and dissapeared from our eyes in phenominal speed, again, no noise.  The traffic then began to move on out.;35.8402834437086;-80.2825811258278
