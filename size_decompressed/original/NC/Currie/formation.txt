Mothership.;2017-03-21 20:20:00;8 minutes;Mothership. Three red lights.  The length of several football fields or more!  Two on both ends and one in the center.   Made no noise what-so-ever.  Was very eerie to witness.  Saw from the back yard.  Wife watched it also.  It was being followed by what looked like an airplane as lights flashed red and white from the object in pursuit of it.   Other aircraft were flying where it had to be noticed (in front and across the sky).   The craft had to be humongous.  And there had to be other witnesses.  No way did that thing get by just us seeing it!  Anyone driving down highway 421 or the backroads had to glimpse it gliding by.;34.4494;-78.0968
