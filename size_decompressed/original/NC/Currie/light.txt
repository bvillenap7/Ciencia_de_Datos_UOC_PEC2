Brilliantly Lit Flying Object With Reddish Orange Lights.;2014-05-03 21:00:00;1 1/2 minutes;Brilliantly Lit Flying Object With Reddish Orange Lights. Approximately at 8:58 PM, Saturday night (5/3/2014), a lower atmosphere flying craft with four extremely bright reddish orange lights in close sequence (like a short cross) that became as bright as a fireball as it approached the airspace in front of our moving car in the town of Currie, NC, as we came to the entrance to James E. Moore Rd. off of the Borough Rd. in rural Pender County.  It was a dazzling sight to behold. I immediately stopped the car and got out and watched it come closer as the wife stayed put in the car unsettled and quite vocal that I left the car parked in the road near a curve.  I then returned back to the car to turn off the ignition in order to listen for any sounds but it made no noise at all as it passed over with it's brilliantly displayed bright lights.  The wife however was still quite vocal about me being parked in the highway as she got out of the car and continued observing the startling craft.. It was a very odd sighting.  I've never encountered this color of lights on any flying craft.  The wife and I watched it just fizzle out in about a minute and a half of seeing it in flight not far to our right.  I was not able to run down the road to look beyond the line of pines where it seemed to just evaporate just above them as I had to remove our parked car from off of the highway. This happened right when daylight was fleeting fast as it got dark within a few minutes after it left.;34.4494;-78.0968
