Red Orange lights exchange light pulses.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by former USCG officer.  PD));2013-08-21 23:00:00;15-20 seconds;Red Orange lights exchange light pulses. My friend and I were on vacation with our families.  We are both former USCG officers.   We were on the upper deck of the house that we were renting, facing west, the house was on the west coast of the Outer Banks peninsula in the town of Rodanthe NC.   At approximately 2300 hrs, we both noticed directly to the west over the water, (approx. 15-20) miles away, an orange-red light suddenly illuminated, it was stationary, almost immediately another light illuminated at a lower altitude and to the north of the first light.   Next the original light emitted a series of light pulses directly in the direction of the second light.  All I can think of to describe is the old Star Trek episodes and the firing of a photon torpedoâ€¦.    The second light immediately responded in kind with a series of light pulses (same orange-red color).  The two main lights then just went out.   And that was it.  No sounds, and the main lights did not move or travel away, they just went out.;35.5916;-75.4706
