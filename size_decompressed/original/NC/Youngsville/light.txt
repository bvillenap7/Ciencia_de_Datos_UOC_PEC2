Object looked like star went across sky north to south to fast to be airplane. Object pulsed bright to dim. On the morning of 02/04/00 at approximatley 0555 I was getting in vehicle when I looked up when I seen what looked like a star was moving from north to south direction it was pulsing from bright to dim I could not make out any shape it appeared to be high up.What brought it to my attention is the fact that I live in an area where alot air traffic going to and from the RDU airport is visible and I have never seen somthing that high go so fast across the sky I observed this object for approximatley 5 to 6 seconds. I observed this object just after being staight up in the sky to disapearing behind some tree's. This object went across sky in a straight path.
