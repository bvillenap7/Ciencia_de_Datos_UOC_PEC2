My witness and I were headed South in a motor vehicle when my witness asked what those lights were. I was driving so I looked and thought at first glance a tower of some sort.  It was well past dusk.  Then upon further notice it seemed they red dots were moving.  First it looked like two then three. We pulled the car over and watched.  The reddish blinking lights seemed to be moving but not necessarily going any where.  It seemed to be now four blinking lights.  Making different formations in the skyline just over the pine tree line in the distance.  Triangle formations and even staggered line patterns. We watched for as long as we could before we had to get it the car and head home.  Once in our neighborhood we couldn't see the area anymore due to trees.  But it seemed to be hanging around for awhile. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));36.0248999999999;-78.4744
