Daylight sighting of a star-shaped object;2006-12-26 15:14:00;10 seconds;Daylight sighting of a star-shaped object I was outside looking up to change a birdfeeder hanging near my windowsill. Out of the corner of my eye I saw what I thought was a hawk floating over my house. After a second or two I realized it had too many wings to be a hawk. It was more of a star shape with about six points, dark against the bright blue December sky.  My next guesses of a very large leaf or (hah!) a flying squirrel were ruled out by the altitude of the object. I guessed it was flying at over 1000 feet.  It cruised silently from almost directly west to east, at roughly 120 to 150 knots at my estimated altitude. As it approached the trees on the eastern horizon, I could no longer make out the points of the star. It now appeared more like a ball.  Perhaps unrelated to this, a helicopter (which I took to be military from the sound) followed the same course (and apparent altitude) exactly ten minutes later.  Earlier today I was taking pictures of hawks and so had my telephoto camera within 20 feet of me but had no time to take a picture of the object.  The object may have been a very large balloon, though I haven't seen many star-shaped balloons of this sort. It flew in the direction of the wind. It made no sudden turns or other unusual movements, nor did it make any sound.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
We noticed a strange object in the sky making all kinds of movements.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));2015-03-12 00:00:00;2 hours;While sitting outside in our back yard by the fire pit, we noticed a strange object in the sky, making all kinds of movements.  We know it was not a star, and it sure was not a plane.   I took several pictures and a video, now maybe an expert can look at the pictures and my video and clarify what this strang phonmenenon was, it cannot be explained by us we need an ufo expert.   There were no storms this night. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
