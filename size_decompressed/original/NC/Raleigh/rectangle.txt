Saw a retangular object about the size of large plane on July 10, 2010, which emitted an amber light from the bottom.;2010-07-10 02:00:00;10 seconds;Saw a retangular object about the size of large plane on July 10, 2010 which emitted an amber light from the bottom. My husband was sleeping in the back part of the house which looks over a wooded four acres with a clearing of about one half acre.  He says that he woke up suddenly which he never does- he is a very sound sleeper.   He looked out the window and saw a rectangular object flying over the clearing area.  From his window he was looking at the underside of the craft which was emitting an orange/amber light.  The craft was traveling from east to west and seemed to be moving quickly.  His window was open and he said the craft made a soft noise that sounded like a skateboard on pavement. Earlier that night, sleeping in the front room, I heard but did not see two helicopters passes about one half hour apart moving west to east.  We are very familiar with helicopter noise since we used to live near a large medical center.  These were low and large helicopters and I would estimate they passed between one and two A.M. We are both college-educated professionals.  Neither of us has seen a UFO prior to this.  My husband is a healthy 65 and I am 56.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Square floating object.;2017-11-03 03:40:00;2 minutes;Square floating object When driving west on 64 towards Raleigh, saw large cube floating north over the city.  I couldn't get a picture bc I was moving in traffic which was frustrating bc it wasn’t moving too quickly.  It was like a square parade balloon got loose and instead of floating up it floated straight.   Figured it would be in the news, but wasn’t.  Came here and thankfully found a similar report.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Large cube shaped object seen in Raleigh.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-03 15:30:00;20 seconds;Large cube shaped object seen in Raleigh. While driving on I-40 in Raleigh on Friday,  I saw a large square shaped object in the sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane with a banner, but it was too big to be a banner.  It looked almost like a Borg cube from ST, with an airplane in close proximity, but both seemed to just vanish.
