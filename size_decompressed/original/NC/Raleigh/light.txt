Blinking light zig-zags and merges with a star.;2001-01-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;Blinking light zig-zags and merges with a star. While looking at the night sky I noticed a blinking light that looked much like the other stars.  At fist I thought it was a plane because it was moving slowly in a horizontal line.  After moving for 30 seconds, it started to zig zag slowly downward, the loop back to it's original position.  It moved horizontally again for about a minute.  Then, it curved downward, much like a shooting star but to slower.  It continuted to arc downward directly into another star.  It appeard to merge with the star and never re appeared.  That particular star remains visible in the night sky.  During this time I also saw 2 small planes fly over.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

Unidentified object that did not have required flashing light travels alongside and aircraft with normal lights.;2001-03-19 19:29:00;2 min.;Unidentified object that did not have required flashing light travels alongside and aircraft with normal lights. Was on back porch which faces south.  Noted commercial aircrafts flying north and south at different altitudes.  All their lights were blinking normally.  Noticed one aircraft flying south at a medium altitude it was not gaining or losing altitude to land at our airport (RDU) or so it seemed.  To its left, or starboard side, was a light of medium plus intensity like a full moon light and color to match (pale yellow). This object emitted or showed no blinking lights whatsoever.  It was neither higher or lower than the aircraft and the distance from the aircraft was between 100 and 300 yards, to the best of my knowledge.  The light disappered at 7:31pm and the aircraft continued south.  The light was traveling the same speed of the aircraft. -Correction On Previous Sighting Report correction is needed as written before i said i reported light on the left side of aircraft, starboard side.  it should read light on left side of aircraft, port side. I want to add that the size of the craft was approxamatly half to three quarters the size of the aircraft;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

Everyone started pointing at something in the sky.  Way above us, very dim, I spotted something that looked like a star--very dim.  There were three or four star-like objects.  At first, I thought it might be a shooting star, but they started moving in multiple directions, rapidly accelerating and changing direction with no discernable purpose.  I looked away to watch a band play at the park, and when I looked again, they were gone.  The other twenty or so people who looked up and could spot them were amazed.  It really freaked a few people out.  I had nothing to drink and no other mind-altering substances. I'm sure several of the other witnesses had, however.

suspicious flashing light white light at Kemp Rd and Highway 98;2007-12-12 21:25:00;3 minutes;Suspicious flashing light white light at Kemp Rd and Highway 98 I was driving north along Kemp Rd in northern Raleigh about 5 miles from high way 98. I saw an incredibly bright, white, flashing light above the trees ahead of the road. It flashed about every 4 seconds, very regularly, I could tell because it was flashing to the beat of the song I was listening to. It was the size of a pin head when I first noticed it and it was a bit too high to be a tower, or any kind and I was too far out in the country for any houses to be around, there are no light poles or even power lines along that road. I know this area pretty well, I live just a few miles away and I drive on that road all the time, I have never seen anything like that out there before. As I drove closer I went around a few turns and it was now on the right side of my car, it got a lot bigger and a lot brighter very quickly. At the biggest, I saw it through the trees, it was almost the size of the moon and it was bright, when I looked at the center it was so bright it blinded my vision, the center looked multicolored or black it was so bright. I do not think it ever moved but I cannot be sure. I have never seen anything up in the air that bright, that big and not moving. When I could not see it I could tell it was there because it kind of lit up the area. 	When I got to highway 98 I turned west back to my house. I could not see the light once I got onto 98, I drove down hill and the light was behind and to the right of me.

I was sitting on my porch just before sun down and heard a ringing in my ear, I then noticed a bright light in the western sky that looked just like the north star in size, brightness, and hieght from the ground.  The light was a solid sphere with no glow,trail, or flashes.   The light then began to slowly shrink down to nothing over a period of about 10 seconds while maintaining its shape with no trail or change in brightness.  It appeared to me that the object was moving directly away from me at a high rate of speed and shrinking.   I heard no sound except the ringing in my ear that lasted only 2-3 seconds after I first saw the object.  I saw no detail in the object and it appeared to be very far away from my location.

2 objects that looked like bright stars moving in parallel about 45 degrees above the horizon;2010-10-19 20:15:00;15 seconds;2 objects that looked like bright stars moving in parallel about 45 degrees above the horizon There were 2 objects moving in parallel that each looked like a bright star.  The moon was bright and there was some high altitude haze in the atmosphere, so most stars were barely visible at the time.  At first glance this looked like 2 stars, but then I noticed they were moving slowly.  They appeared to be at very high altitude, maybe 40K feet.  The moved due East in parallel to each other for about 10 seconds.  Then they faded away gradually over a ~5 second period.   I estimate the lights were about 45 degrees above the horizon. There are no major airports due East of Raleigh, but there are military bases East of here.  These lights did not have the typical strobes flashing that is common on commercial aircraft.   Most high altitude air traffic over Raleigh is running North-South up the East coast of the country.  Given the lack of strobes on what I observed, I'm confident these were not commercial aircraft. The only plausible explanation would be military aircraft.  Military aircraft can run without lights.  But do they have bright lights to illuminate them like a star?  These objects were bright and no strobes were present.  The looked like bright stars or a planet would look, such as Venus.  Given that they appeared to be at high altitude, they would not have been flying in close military formation.  I would estimate the distance between these 2 objects would have been over a mile if they were at 40K feet.  Given that they were well above the horizon and the lights faded relatively quickly (~5 seconds), it's not consistent with an aircraft slowing flying out of sight over the horizon.  I have no explanation. Also, high altitude commercial air traffic was leaving vapor trails in the atmosphere on this night, visible by the moonlight.  These objects left no vapor trail.

I watched the light for 5 minutes or so before alerting my friends to it, not wanting it to be a plane or a helicopter and appear stupid.  As far as I could tell I couldn't hear the sound of an engine or whirring of blades such as a helicopter.  After I told my friends, they confirmed my beliefs that it was a UFO.

Every night for the past couple nights, I see a light in the same position in the sky.  It is very high in the sky seeing as how I can only make it out as a light.  It slowly rises directly up to a point and will stop.  The light will persist in the same location for varying lengths of time. I cannot ascertain how long precisely.  When I return to smoke another cigarette it can still be there or it can be gone.  There are no discernable stars in the vicinity and the light is completely gone. It doesnt flash and has a slight orange or red tint to it.  Planes will occasionally fly close to it but it seems they are just flying through.  Perhaps the light is higher in the sky than these planes although I cannot tell. This part is stupid and probably just my overactive imagination but I had been watching the NCAA Tournament all night and when the commerical for the movie Paul came on, the TV blacked out several times during the commericial but at no other time at any point in the night.

A bright white light that was extremely fast with no sound, ejected 2 smaller objects in opposite directions.;2012-04-09 20:45:00;2 minutes;A bright white light that was extremely fast with no sound, ejected 2 smaller objects in opposite directions. At approx 8:45 on the night of 4/9/2012 I was letting my dogs outside for their last bathroom trip for the night when I looked up in the sky and saw a bright light in the south eastern part of the sky. The light was extremely bright and moved at a high rate of speed.  What got my attention was that there was no sound and there were absolutely no flashing lights of any kind. I called for my fiance to come and see, she also noted that there were no flashing lights and that it just did not move like a plane because of the high rate of steady speed. As it moved from the south east it increased its brightness by 50% then made a very sharp turn towards due east at about a 60' to 70' degree angle then as its brightness decreased we could see 2 smaller objects, 1 ejected from each side of the object, 1 going north and 1 going south at the exact same speed.  The objects that came out of the side of the light/object moved so fast they were gone as soon as they came ou! t. The object then gave off one last bright burst then I lost sight of it over my neighbors roof. Never seeing anything of this nature before, I posted a question to Facebook to see if anyone else in my area saw anything strange in the night sky. I got a reply to this site from a friend saying that this site(NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER)might be able to answer some questions for me, so I thought I would share my experience for those who are interested in strange aerial phenomenon.

We saw the second light flicker very lightly just a few times until they were no longer visible. They did not completely cross the sky.  We could have watched them go even further but they disappeared before then.  We heard neighbors outside and one said, ‘What the hell is that?’  so we knew we were not the only ones who saw this. The lights did not blink and were extremely red/orange in color and quite large.  The lights were constant the entire time.  I have never seen anything like this and am continually checking the local news to see if others caught it.  The sky is extremely clear with only a few sparse clouds. Being a skeptic I couldn’t help but think it was a plane of some sort until we saw commercial planes fly by and it was extremely obvious these were not commercial planes.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

But by the time we got to the US70/Glenwood Ave. exit the lights were not far apart enough to be airliners coming in for separate landings (also from experience one of the planes should have gone overhead by the time we reached the exit.  So we assumed they were helicopters from the NC Air Guard site next to the RDU airport.  At the Creedmoor Rd. exit the lights were directly above us still heading towards the airport.   We rolled down the windows to hear the helicopter blades and engines  but there was no sound as the lights passed overhead.  We traveled south on Creedmoor and at the Strickland Rd interchange the lights reappeared over the car meaning the lights did not proceed towards the airport but headed back in the direction they originally came in.

I didn’t say anythin to my sister for a while I jus watched the blue light until it disappeared & appeared again. I still didn’t say anything until the first light got brighter then it would lesson it’s brightness. It wasn’t someone walking with a flashlight but they were gettin closer.

She saw it. & it disappeared again. & that’s when I was confused as to what I was seeing. We’re these people ? I haven’t hot boxed that spot in a week. So many questions unanswered.

The object moved fast, and had a straight trajectory with no arc as it maintained a parallel path with the ground.  There was only one object.  Due to it being lit, I could not make out the exact shape however, the lights were confined to a rectangle-like formation.  The light was white. I could not discern the distance above ground, however it was lower than a typical airplane or jet and there was no sound.  The speed was extremely fast.  I would compare it to the speed of a jet seen at low altitude, only perhaps faster.  It was visible for approximately five seconds and then disappeared.

My husband and I were walking up our driveway around 8:45pm, extremely quiet night & the sky was still bright.  We noticed a really bright stationary steady light (brighter than a planet) in the northeast sky.  No other stars or planets were out.  Just seemed out of place. It didn't move for about 10minutes (we were trying to figure if it was a planet or space station).  Also, it was not where a planet would be (calibrated StarWalk to moon & nothing bright should be there).  My husband was caught off guard & mentioned how it was changing colors.  Then, it disappeared.  We looked for it about 2-3 minutes and all of a sudden reappeared in same position (small light that got brighter and brighter until it was as bright as before..and there were no clouds to distort the view), stationary about 1 minute then IT STARTED MOVING northward (to the left) about the speed of a second hand on a watch. It moved, by perception, about 4 inches across sky then light just quickly phased out.   As soon as it disappeared again My husband saw a pulsating LED light which flashed 3 times, then paused, and flashed 3 times again (about 3 flashes in 2 seconds) coming thru the trees from southeast toward the west.  He mentioned there was a plane coming although there was no noise (we were still looking for the light in the sky).  He thought it was a plane until it stopped on our side of the treeline.  Brilliantly white bright light. Then I saw it.  It followed right under the top tree line (about 50 ft up).  When it got in front our trees but still in the branches, behind our house, then the lights started  going south to north following our tree line (sometimes a little lower in the tree line and then sometimes a little higher but was never lower than about 50 feet) until it got to the top of our  most northward tallest tree & then disappeared.  Just 3 flashing-then-pause-then flashing little but amazingly bright LED-like white lights.  I thought maybe a drone but there was absolutely no noise.  Plus, as my husband pointed out, it was too close into the trees. Please give some rational explanation.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

They were spaced too far apart to be connected on an airplane and I saw nothing connecting them, but they were moving perfectly in tandem. They were alternately fading in and out (one became brighter as the other faded out). They eventually  moved so that only one was visible above the trees - and that one moved suddenly in a different direction and then stationed in the sky. I was at an intersection and had to drive before I could see anything more.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
String of lights over Raleigh near falls lake;2021-05-07 21:00:00;3-4 minutes;String of lights over Raleigh near falls lake Near Falls Lake walked out of the house. Wife looked up and said what's that. I said probably birds. She then said birds that have lights? Conditions sparse clouds, dark. Second look I could see a string of lights heading west to east in an subtle arc. Moving at a pace probably double to triple a commercial airliner. Evenly spaced if I held a ruler to the sky I would say 1/2 inch apart from my vantage point. Some were a little higher than others all moving steady in the same direction. When they hit a certain spot in the sky they disappeared one by one as if going behind a curtain. They came into view in the west about 25% (1/4 distance from horizon) across the night sky disappearing at about the same point in the east. My 18 year old son also saw this. We tried to film it but it came out too dark to see. The lights were very very high in the sky;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
