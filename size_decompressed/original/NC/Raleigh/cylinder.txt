It was a long slim cylinder of shiny metal with two colored sections-one red and one black each about 1/4 of the length of the craft.;2008-07-03 11:00:00;2 to 3 seconds;I am always curious about my surroundings and look at the sky far more than anyone else I know. I have always loved spotting planes and trying to identify them and have read many books on aircraft. At about 11am in bright clear sunshine I was driving roughly westward on the Raleigh Inner beltline when I saw directly in front of me what obviously was an airliner flying at low speed. It was at very low altitude and seemed about 2 or 3 miles away flying above the trees and straight across my path. I stared at it for maybe 2 seconds. It was a long slim cylinder of shiny metal with two colored sections-one red and one black each about 1/4 of the length of the craft. I saw no wings, tail section or engines but assumed this was due to looking from the side of the plane and maybe some subtle reflection of sunlight was hiding the tail. Also, since it is extremely common to see aircraft approaching nearby Raleigh/Durham International Airport, I had instantly dismissed it as an airliner and looked slightly away from it to maintain my lane position but glanced right back within about 1 second to confirm what type of plane it was. Within that one second it had vanished. I blinked my eyes repeatedly like people do in the movies... but due to the craft's low speed and relatively wide sighting area I had in front of me I would have had to look away for at least 5 or 6 seconds to miss it going behind trees and buildings in the distance. This event did not conform to any rational explanation I can think of other than that it was an extremely advanced technology and either departed or became invisible instantaneously.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Cylindrical Object Over Raleigh NC;2010-09-25 11:15:00;2-3 seconds;Cylindrical Object Over Raleigh NC On September 25th, 2010 I was driving on I-40 through Raleigh, NC.  At approximately 11:15 am near exit 300, I noticed a cylindrical object ascending in the sky at 45 degree angle from the north toward the south.  I thought at first that it was an airliner but there were no wings and no tail.  It appeared to be dark gray at first then shimmered as if reflecting the sunlight.  Then the object de-materialized from the inside out starting on the left side moving to the right until the cylinder had completely disappeared.  Though there were clouds in the sky, they were small with plenty of blue sky between them.  The object did not fly behind a cloud, it vanished while I watched.  The entire episode lasted about 3 seconds. The object was about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. I’m a father in my mid-30s working in healthcare.  I’m interested in UFOs, but I don’t necessarily think every sighting is anomalous or of an alien spacecraft.  I’ve reflected on my sighting for several days and cannot come up with a reasonable explanation.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Dark cylinder hanging motionless in the sky near a jet.;2012-04-24 14:00:00;Few seconds;Dark cylinder hanging motionless in the sky near a jet. This sighting took place somewhere in North or Northeast Raleigh, North Carolina. I lived there with my girlfriend at the time for a short while and since I rarely ventured out of the house, I was unfamiliar with the area, so I'll try to give my best recollection involving where we might have been when I saw this UFO. We're traveling in my girlfriend's car on what I believe was Spring of 2012.  She was driving. I'm in the passenger seat and there was no one else besides us in the car.  As we're moving I was looking at all the scenery and it was a beautiful day.  In my peripheral vision, I noticed a large passenger jet somewhat high in the sky.  The jet wasn't low. I'd wager it was flying at roughly 10-20,000 feet. That's when I saw it. Just in front of the jet's path looked to what I can only describe as an Oil Drum or a dark, almost black-looking cylinder, upright like an oil drum.  Now it was hard to tell but it looked like it was up there really close to this jet which was heading towards it. The windows in the car were up so I heard no noise.  It just seemed to hang there, motionless in the sky.  I was excited so I told my girlfriend and she wanted to see it and asked where it was.  I said, It's up there, by that plane!  Unfortunately, she couldn't look as she was driving.  I probably looked at this thing for about a minute, no more.  As we drove some trees blocked my view.  We pulled up to a traffic light and that's when I looked up again only this time all I could see was the jet and no cylinder. To give an idea of the sizes of this jet and cylinder, at arm's length, the jet would have been about the size of my thumb and the cylinder was about 1/3 that size.  I wish I could give more information but the sighting was brief. Just one last thing.  As I said, I was unfamiliar with the area, but I know we used to live a mile west of Route 1, a.k.a. (Capital Blvd).  We lived off of Durant road between Capital Blvd. and Falls of Neuse Rd.  The sighting was not too far from this area.  I wish I could tell you the name of the road we were on, but all I can tell you is we were no more than 5 miles from our house on our way to get a burger from this great little burger and hotdog place where you walk up to the window and they take your order.  When it's ready they call your number, go up to the window, get your food, and then we would just sit in our car and eat.  That's the best description I can give as, yet again, I can't remember the name of the place!;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
A black cylindrical object seen fairly close to an airplane during daytime;2012-10-14 15:30:00;1 minute;A black cylindrical object seen fairly close to an airplane during daytime My girlfriend and I were on our way to get burgers for lunch over the weekend in the northern Raleigh area. My girlfriend says we were travelling East on Millbrook Road towards Millbrook Collection, which is a shopping center, located at the corner of Millbrook Rd./Atlantic Ave. My girlfriend was driving and since I'm still quite new to the area, I was looking around and noticed, what I believed to be chem-trails, which were all intersecting in one spot in the sky, similar to the shape of an asterisk. Just west of this formation, in the sky, was an airplane which left an extremely long plume of white vapor. In the same area as this plane, was a solid black object, sort of, cylindrical-shaped, with some kind of blurry feature on it. Both the plane and the black object appeared very high. I'm guessing that that plane was at crusing altitude, so what's that, 30,000+ feet?  Well, it appeared that the black object was at least that high. At arms length, the object was about the size of a pencil's eraser. If this object was indeed around the same height as the plane, it must have been 1/4 size in comparison to it. The distance from the object to the plane appeared to be 300-400 yards.  The object made no noise. At first, I thought it was a bird, but it didn't move. I observed this for at least a mile, still in the same spot. At some point, the trees got in my view and i was unable to see it. Once past the trees, I looked and the plane was still there but the black object was gone. I didn't see it again. I've made several reports on this site over the years.  This is the first UFO I've seen and reported in the Raleigh, NC area.  The others were all seen by me and other witnesses in and around the Charlotte, NC area.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Every night I go out side to smoke a cigarette at about 11:00 o'clock.  And every night in the same spot, there is this craft flashing;2015-09-15 00:00:00;1-2 hours;Every night I go out side to smoke a cigarette at about 11:00 o'clock.  And every night in the same spot, there is this craft flashing different colors.  It moves very slow flashing its light.  I never really paid it any mine, but every night it flashes multiple colors for about hour.  I always go back outside a hour later and its gone!

Pill-shaped object seen flying behind and around airplane.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-21 14:15:00;30 seconds;Pill shaped object seen flying behind and around airplane. I was looking out of my window and saw what was clearly a plane with a short lasting contrail following the plane.  I was inside so I’m not sure if there was a clear sound.  Either way it looked like a normal plane.  I first noticed it flying out of the southwest and it continued to fly into the northwestern part of the sky.   Suddenly, I noticed a second flying object and it wasn’t leaving a contrail, it just flew into the area i happened to be looking at from a lower altitude.  The second object appeared white but it may have been a different color since stuff up high usually looks lighter than what it really is but it looked kinda like a pill shape and continued to fly into the contrails of the airplane quickly.  It wasn’t flying abrutly but it was making maneuvers that I think would be difficult for a plane to make.   Then both of the objects moved out of my line of sight.
