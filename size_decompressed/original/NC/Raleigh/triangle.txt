Large Triangle object in sky over North Carolina;1986-10-20 19:00:00;2-3 minutes;Large Triangle object in sky over North Carolina This night in question takes place years ago.  I don’t even know the date, but it must have been from say early October, or until the end of march.  The reason I say this, is because my best friend and I had gone to watch NC State play basketball.  So it was definitely during basketball season.  The year was 1985, or 1986.   The only reason I’m reporting it, is because I see others who have seen similar objects.  I’ve (We’ve) kept it to ourselves all these years.  Oh, we have mentioned it to a few people, but you can imagine what kind of ribbing we took. Anyway, it was after the ball game, and that would have been between 9 and 12 pm depending on what time the game was.  I really don’t remember if it was a 7:00 game or an 9:00 game.   We were on our way back home on 50 highway from Raleigh towards Benson.   We were driving in a small pickup when we noticed a huge black object to our left.  It was really low, if I had to guess, I would say maybe 600 feet or less.  I would guess the object to be at least as long as a football field.     We pulled over and both of us opened our doors, got out, and looked up as this huge triangular object passed over us.  It was solid black, with no discernable lights except for the very tip of the triangle.  The other thing worth mentioning, is that it was slowly rotating as it moved.   Well we stood there and watched this object move from the left to directly overhead moving to the right of us.  Since we were on 50 south, that would have been East to West.   As we looked up, we were both in awe.  It made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  Completely silent.  I think that was the eeriest part of the whole thing.  How could something that huge fly the way it was flying, and make not a bit of sound.   We tried to follow it somewhat, but because it was so low to the ground, it was out of sight in less than 2 minutes. Gone behind the treeline. We’ve often discussed it between ourselves, but not made too many waves.  We never heard anything else, and we figured something that big would have had to be seen and reported by other people.  I know what I saw, and I’ve watched a lot of shows about our military, and never never have seen an aircraft like what I just described.  I’m pretty sure the stealth was not out at that time, but even if it was, it did not fly in the manner with which I witnessed that night.   My main reason for posting this, was to see maybe, just maybe someone else saw the same thing my friend and I did, and about that same time frame.  It would validate my experience somewhat and verify that I was not crazy!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Huge triangle passes over oblivious, sleeping capital;1987-10-15 02:00:00;2 minutes;Huge triangle passes over oblivious, sleeping capital I was staying at my girlfriend's parents' home (They made us sleep in separate rooms) and I was awakened by a low-pitched, rumbling vibration and sound. I went to the window and opened it to look out. Almost my entire veiw of the sky was blotted out by a huge triangular shape with lights running down the sides and marking the corners. It seemed incredibly low and was moving very slowly toward the West. I watched until the entire length passed overhead and the rumbling began to grow more distant. I was astounded and wondered what to do--then I remembered that I was in the middle of a city and realized that this would be big news in the morning--it couldn't have gone unnoticed--so I decided to go back to bed! No one else that I know of saw a thing, so I've kept it largely to myself until now. The report from Louisburg NC seems to be very similar and may have been the same night. But mine made noise.

Bright Green Triangle in sky zooms ahead and disappears in an instant.;2007-04-14 22:00:00;7 seconds;Bright Green Triangle in sky zooms ahead and disappears in an instant. I was driving in the car around 10:30pm last night with friends and two of us saw an airplane flying at a high altitude. Well below the plane, almost parralel at the time a bright green triangle shape appeared. It soard ahead roughly 10 times the speed at which the plane was traveling. It then stopped on a dime and just disappeared abruptly. The sky was clear and there were no hills, buildings or end of horizon which it could have went behind. Two of us saw it but reacted internally at first and then 5 seconds later, I asked if anyone saw what I just did and my one friend did. It was amazing and inexplicable. Unfortunately, we had no cameras with us. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous provides e-mail address only.  PD));35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Glowing green triangle moving at a very fast pace, stopping, flew away even faster, no noise over RBC Center.;2007-04-14 23:30:00;4 seconds;Glowing green triangle moving at a very fast pace, stopping, flew away even faster, no noise over RBC Center. For 12 years I have been a network engineer for one of the largest communications companies on the planet.   At this time, I was working in the FAANMC for the FAA under MCI before Verizon had bought us out and the FAANMC contract went to Harris.  We provided communications for the Federal Aviation Administration and managed their network.   I had never seen anything before, and still do not know what I did see.  I was driving home from work, I worked 3 pm until 11pm and my days worked rotated.   I was exiting on Wade Ave from I40 East, and as I drove towards the RBC Center I saw it.  I had my 2006 F150 Lariat’s windows and sun roof open.  Normally when I get on Wade, I take the next exit Edwards Mill Rd to get home.   But right before I got there I looked up and saw a glowing greenish triangle aircraft fly over the RBC center at a high rate of speed then stopped.   I hit my brakes as we as the other few cars around me as it hovered for a bit.  It then made a lateral movement with no sound and took off back towards the direction it came so fast I could not follow it with my eyes.   I started getting out of my truck but just drove home and convinced myself it was nothing.   I have not spoken of it since now but I thought it may help someone out there or I know what we saw that night.   I know the military choppers are always doing maneuvers in that area, I just wish I knew what really happened and what it is was.   I have seen a lot of aircraft and know what they should be able to do and this should not have been able to have been completed.  The stop, acceleration and speed were like nothing I have ever seen.   Best of luck to all, I hope this helps. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Large triangle shaped object with 2 lights flying low to the ground over a major highway;2008-03-27 21:35:00;15 seconds;Large triangle shaped object with 2 lights flying low to the ground over a major highway While driving an ambulance down 401 South saw a triangle shaped object very low to ground.  Approximately 1000 feet in air moving at a very high rate of speed, looking up at the object could make out that it was a triangle with no tail or other markings noted.  There was a red light on the back left corner and a white light noted to the back right corner.  Was just above the trees at approximately 1000 feet and pulled our ambulance up and over to see the object to continue moving east at a high rate of speed.  Witnessed by two credible paramedics.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Triangle shaped craft with 4 white lights and 1 blinking red light passed silently overhead;2009-05-20 21:15:00;:00:45;Triangle shaped craft with 4 white lights and 1 blinking red light passed silently overhead I saw white lights approaching in the sky as I drove North down Oberlin Rd. in Raleigh NC. As I neared the bridge over Wade Ave., the lights got closer and closer until a triangle shaped craft passed slowy overhead. It had two white lights at the narrow end of the equilateral triangle and two on the broad end, with a smaller blinking red light in the middle. The craft passed over head with no noise whatsoever and continued in the opposite direction. It was about 300 feet over tree top level, and appeared to be the about twice the size of my car. Had I heard engine noise, I would have thought from the shape that it was fighter jet of some kind.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
V-Shaped Craft Hovering Above the Intersection of Six Forks Road and I-540 in Raleigh NC;2011-02-05 18:50:00;10 Minutes;V-Shaped Craft Hovering Above the Intersection of Six Forks Road and I-540 in Raleigh NC As my wife and I pulled out of our driveway last night around a quarter till 7PM, I noticed a very bright light a little ways off.  At first I thought it might be a passenger jet's landing lights (as seen from head-on) since we live only a few miles from RDU, but after watching it for about 30 seconds, we realized it could not be a plane because it wasn't moving.  A car was coming up behind me on the street, so we continued on our way to our destination. It takes about 5 minutes to get out of our neighborhood and onto I-540 (the outer loop around Raleigh).  As we were pulling onto 540, we again saw the light(s) ahead of us.  As we got closer, we could start making out the details better.  There were red lights on either side of the 'craft', and white lights in the middle.  540 is a very busy road on Saturday evenings, and as we were getting really close to this object, all of the cars in front of us were slowing down to look at it as well.  It was hovering just above the trees at the intersection of Six Forks Road and 540.  It looked like a V with large white lights in the center and down both wings with the red lights on the tips of the wings.  It looked to be about the size of a passenger jet, but again it was not moving.  I wanted to get out and take photos with my phone, but we were running late for our event and my wife didn't want me to stop. Anyway, I'm just hoping that maybe someone else took the time to report this as well as I know many, many people saw this.  Maybe someone can check with air traffic at RDU as it must have been on their radar. It was not a plane, nor was it a helicopter (much too big).  It's worth noting that it was not there when we returned home 4 hours later.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Three triangular craft visible for 5 min near I-540 on 2/27/2013;2013-02-27 19:00:00;5 minutes;Three triangular craft visible for 5 min near I 540 on 2/27/2013 I saw three triangular craft over I-540  over a large patch of trees.   I was at stop sign juncture of Macon Road and Ray Road.  I thought at first it had to be three military planes flying in perfect formation and i was amazed at the slow speed and exact eqiudistance and how the planes maintained that exact distance but were also able to stay in air at such slow speed.  I realized they were only at most 2 to 3 miles from rdu airport and i decided to try to take a closer look. There were 3 lights on each craft.  Once i pulled over and looked back either the trees obscured my view or they took off.  I never saw side view or any view other than complete triangle appearance which was weird.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
3 red lights on shadow outline of triangle shaped craft, slowly flying just above tree line silently.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2013-11-04 23:00:00;3 minutes;3 red lights on shadow outline of triangle shaped craft, slowly flying just above tree line silently. Four of our dogs started growling and barking towards the front of our home.  I was in bed with my husband and saw a floating light through the slats in our bedroom window.  I could tell they were too high off of the ground to be a car, so I got out of bed to check it out.   Looking out the window, I saw the tail end of the craft.  It was triangle shaped with 3 red lights on the rear and emitted no sounds at all.  I could hear the cars driving down the main road by our home, but could not hear any engine like sounds coming from the flying craft.  It seriously scared me, it couldn't have been a plane or helicopter as there was no sound at all from the craft.   My husband thinks it may have been a government drone.  I don't know what it could have been.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

Pair of Silent V shaped objects with red-orange lights  flying low and slow over Raleigh, NC;2016-04-15 21:45:00;10 minutes;Pair of Silent V shaped objects with red-orange lights  flying low and slow over Raleigh, NC On the evening of 4/15/2016, we were out to dinner with two other adults in Raleigh, NC. Upon arriving back in front of our home and saying our good nites to the other couple, some lights in the sky caught our attention.  There were two  noiseless objects with red orange lights flying low in the sky in tandem.  There was absolute silence, so they were definitely not helicopters.  The objects were V-shaped with what appeared to be headlights on the front.  Their speed was slower than a helicopter or any plane that has flown over this residential neighborhood.  They never waivered from their path.  We all watched them until they they were no longer visible.  We all agreed this was nothing we had ever seen before(and yes we were all sober).  The other couple left us and later in the week when we spoke again, they reported they saw 2 more of the same objects traveling in the night sky as they neared their residence.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
