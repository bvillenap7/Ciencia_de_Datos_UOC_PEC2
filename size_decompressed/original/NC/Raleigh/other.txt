Green scanner laser like light flashes over the sky in Raleigh, NC;2010-11-17 01:32:00;3 seconds;Green scanner laser like light flashes over the sky in Raleigh, NC There was a green laser like light that came up above over the horizon that was in a fan shape and similar to that of a scanner at a grocery store.  The fact that it was cloudy and has been a rainy day, made it that much more clearer to see it.  It looked like it flashed a few times and then stopped and then another flash filled the sky above where I was driving and all of the power in my neighborhood went out...weird stuff...scary weird stuff;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Cloaking plane;2011-03-04 08:45:00;4 minutes;Cloaking plane It looked like a plane, not very high up, not a jet(not that big).  It compleatly disappeared for 30 seconds and then reappeared for 1 minute and then disappeared again for as long as I kept looking.  It wasen't far enough away that the angle would have made it that hard to see as it was almost over head.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Strange, possibly extra-terrestrial energy display in the sky in Raleigh NC.;2011-07-15 19:30:00;5 minutes;Strange, possibly extra-terrestrial energy display in the sky in Raleigh NC. I apologize as this is not exactly a sighting of a UFO but rather a strange and unexplainable occurrence in our atmosphere.  I have tried telling this story a few places and around the internet but have gotten no feedback, corroboration, or other information from any of these sources and I was actually hoping you could possibly tell me that I and my partner who also witnessed this are not alone in seeing this type of occurrence.   It was the summer of 2011 (I'm sorry I cannot tell you the exact date) and the sky had 100% cloud cover.  The clouds were very low and dark but not too dark.  It looked like a storm of some sort was brewing so me and my partner went out into the street to see what sort of natural spectacle that storms normally produce.   Then without any thunder or noise of any sort a grid made up of perfect hexagons of what could only appear to be electricity appeared over head.  I would say it formed about 3 rows at a time of chains of perfectly shaped hexagons that moved or scanned back and forth across the sky in an east-to-west direction.   There was no thunder, no rain only these electrical shapes.   I was mesmerized but I would say the formation lasted approx. 1 minute and scanned back and forth changing direction several times.   I have never heard of any sort of event and I cannot seem to find anyone who can shed any more light on this.   Again I apologize as this is not exactly a UFO sighting but I have exhausted all other sources and am desperate for some type of clue. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Pyramid shaped craft with random blinking lights on the points of it, rotating in all directions.;2011-08-24 12:45:00;10 min;Pyramid shaped craft with random blinking lights on the points of it, rotating in all directions. I was driving to the convenience store, and noticed strange lights moving together in the sky.   At first I assumed it was a plane, but I could make out very faint lines in between the lights, forming a pyramid shape.  It hovered on a Z-axis for a few moments very slowly and stayed motionless quite often.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Two lights, one red and one small green;2012-08-31 00:20:00;5 minutes;Two lights, one red and one small green I have a new camera and wanted to see if I could capture a picture of the moon.  So I went outside and looked for a clear angle.  As I was positioning the camera a red dot flashed on the LCD screen.  Not knowing what it was, I checked the camera to be sure I had it set correctly.  I then noticed that the red dot was in the sky, much smaller than the moon.  It flashed again, and I took a picture.  I then moved over slightly to take a second picture.  I then noticed another object (blue/green) below the red.  After taking the two photos I returned indoors.  When I loaded the photos in my computer I noticed the other was green, smaller and positioned below the red dot.  So I enlarged them.  I do not know what to think about all of this other than it is strange.  They looked like dots until I enlarged them.  The enlargements look like vapors or fog.  See photos attached.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Unidentified lights/craft over Raleigh/Durham - RDU Airport tells news reporters it is military exercises.;2013-02-27 19:20:00;25 minutes;Unidentified lights/craft over Raleigh/Durham - RDU Airport tells news reporters it is &quotmilitary exercises&quot There were literally dozens of aircraft and unidentified lights in the night sky over Raleigh and Durham, North Carolina on February 27, 2013.  Dozens (if not more) of people called local news outlets to report them.  When the news outlets contacted RDU airport, they were told that helicopters were conducting military exercises and that there was no threat to public safety, and nothing to worry about. Witnesses (myself, my adult daughter and my sister included) all saw unidentified craft that sometimes hovered, sometimes darted, and that moved at times with incredible speed.  Some of the crafts had only white lights, some had only red lights, some had only intermittent strobes and were completely dark for as much as three to five seconds at a time. First we saw three unidentified craft over the area near Six Forks Road in North Raleigh.  They had white lights and moved very slowly at first.  As we continued to watch them, the left and right aircraft turned off their white lights and turned on much dimmer red lights, at the same time the middle craft became very bright white.   Then they all three went almost dark, and suddenly sped from the Six Forks area, crossing over Falls of Neuse Rd and moving over toward Atlantic Avenue/Capital Blvd at an incredible rate of speed, then suddenly slowed down and resumed moving slowly, at very low altitude, and again with white lights. We then left the area and travelled toward Durham on I-540.   Suddenly the sky was filled with white strobe lights!  The lights would go dark for as much as three to five seconds at a time - there were at least 12 to 15 of these craft and they were moving slowly and at a low to moderate altitude (1000 feet?). While viewing these, three triangular shaped craft with red lights only appeared back toward the airport, at a higher altitude and approximately 45 degrees away from the objects with the strobe lights.  The strobe lights appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly - the red objects were moving more quickly, toward the southwest.   Soon two longer craft appeared in between, shaped almost like long-wing gliders, with a row of white lights down the central part of the object and red flashing lights on each end.  We would occasionlly see commercial airliners landing and/or taking off, and these were obviously not similar to those. At no time did we hear any noise from any of the objects, even those we were closest to.  For the further objects we were not close enough that we would have expected to hear anything. We have been around airports and even Air Force bases all our lives (two of us were Air Force brats growing up, one former U.S. Army infantry veteran and one lived near an Air Force base in California) and we all agreed this objects/craft were unlike anything we had ever seen. We left the area and continued to our homes, west of Durham.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Multiple crafts delineated by bright, burnt orange colored lights over I-40 by Raleigh.;2014-11-28 21:40:00;3-5 minutes;Multiple crafts delineated by bright, burnt orange colored lights over I-40 by Raleigh. While driving on I-40 from Raleigh to Chapel Hill, my family and I (both parents and my brother) and witnessed multiple objects flying relatively low, utterly soundless.  Opaque darkness obscured stars above the area between lights one object was a triangular shape and one was a slightly arced line.   The lights were a burnt orange color, quite bright and steady, and lasted for 3-5 minutes.   We first saw the lights from a distance and drove directly under them and they disappeared from view a couple of minutes after we passed.

Bright flashing and kept moving fast and faded.;2016-01-11 19:00:00;60 seconds;Bright flashing and kept moving fast and faded. Odd light, thought it was a satellite to be honest, but ive seen many before and this one was odd.  Seemed to be moving at a fast pace, flashed very brightly for a couple of seconds then continued to go and began to fade faster and disappeared and reappeared much further then the previous place.
