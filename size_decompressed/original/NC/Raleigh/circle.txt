I took note of a light outside my window which I thought was the moon.   It began to flash like a strobe, lighting up the entire second story window.  I was terrified and unable to let my husband know. After a period of 16 minutes it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we she sounded to us to be quite objective and credible.  He oral description over the telephone was quite a bit more involved that what she describes above.  PD));35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
I saw 4 large white lights circling then meeting together and going back out again;2009-10-03 00:15:00;1 hour;I saw 4 large white lights circling then meeting together and going back out again Last night, on the way home from work, I witnesses some strange lights in the sky. I work second shift and got off work at 12:00A.M. At first I thought the lights were search lights for planes because the airport is nearby. I kept seeing the lights too frequently for them to be search lights or even the giant spot lights used sometimes when a car dealership is having a big sale. When I got to my exit, I pulled off to the side of the road and exited my car. I saw 4 large white lights going around in circles. They would meet in the center and spread quickly back out again. I guess I stood out there about 5 or 10 minutes just looking up in wonder and amazement. I am female, and as cars came up the exit, not one stopped to see why I was standing by the side of the road, looking up and pointing at the sky. I called my sister who works at Wal-Mart third shift, just a few miles away and told her something was going in the sky and described what I saw. When I got to Wal-Mart, I went in and got my sister and one of her co-workers to come outside and look at the sky. They were also witnesses to the lights. As one lady was leaving the store, I pointed to the sky and told her to look at the sky. Her reaction was, Oh, my God.  As long as I live I will never forget what I saw last night. NEVER!

We were sitting on neighbor's front porch and spotted orange ball of light move slowly across sky and hover above us.  The light stayed in sky about a minute and faded away.   Five minutes later another ball appeared and stayed about a minute and disappeared.   We all had our cell phones and tried to take pics but the light would not show up on any of our camera's.   Ten minutes later another ball appeared for 1 minute and disappeared.   It was no plane or helicopter.  It was silent with some erratic movement.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
UFO sighting in Raleigh/Knightdale on Thanksgiving;2011-11-24 20:30:00;5 sec;UFO sighting in Raleigh/Knightdale on Thanksgiving My boyfriend and I actually had 2 sightings on this evening.  As we were driving towards Knightdale, in Raleigh, on Highway 64 business, we saw something shoot from the sky straight down and disappear.  It had a glow to it as it shot down, and came down within a blink of an eye. Then, a little while later as we were standing in line on black Friday outside behind the best buy building, my boyfriend said, Look.  As I look up, and so did the other people in line behind and ahead of us, I saw two circular saucers flying in a staggered formation, one was slightly ahead of the other, across the skyline. It was almost like they were floating as they were moving, their movement was very fluid. Once we realized what they were, they were gone.  They disappeared extremely fast. They looked like they were very dark gray or black with dull, glowing lights around the bottom.  The other people in line also saw this, and were amazed. I know what I saw was not anything of this world.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

Orange light over North Raleigh.;2014-01-17 21:00:00;3 minutes;Orange light over North Raleigh. Was walking my dog when I say a floating yellow/orange light about 2 miles away.  It was bright enough that I knew it wasn't a plane or a star.  It floated there for about a minute before slowly moving across the sky towards RDU.  It didn't get smaller or bigger. And kept steady speed while moving.  I knew it wasn't a plane before A.  Planes don't float in mid-air, B. planes and helicopters don't have lights that stay on at all times.  And it moved too slow and steady for a plane coming in to land.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

We watched it for about 45 seconds and it appeared to be headed towards Southeast.  Very quiet and moving at a slower pace then a airplane.  It was so bright that you really could not see what type of shape because the whole object was bright Orange and it appeared to have a destination because it stay course.  This is the second siting me and my wife seen.  The first siting we could actually see the spaceship less than 300 ft up with no sound whatsoever if it was not for us looking up we never would have seen it.

Two concentric rings of light moved slowly across the night sky, stopped for 10 minutes, then moved back in the opposite direction.;2015-08-14 21:38:00;17 minutes;Two concentric rings of light moved slowly across the night sky, stopped for 10 minutes, then moved back in the opposite direction. On a clear night at 9:30pm, I sat in a lounge chair with my girlfriend on my back deck to do some stargazing, maybe catch a meteor or two, and then view the International Space Station that would later pass at 9:57pm.   At 9:38pm I noticed something unfamiliar in the sky with my naked eye in the area of the Andromeda galaxy.  At first I thought I was looking at a star.  However, after looking at it for a few seconds, I noticed it was moving very slowly from East to West, it was larger (not brighter though) than a star and it was  egg-shaped.   At this point I figured it was some unique satellite so I ran to get my binoculars for a closer look.  Within 30 seconds I returned with my Bushnell 10x50 wide angle binoculars.  After focusing in on the object I was completely astonished.  It was two concentric rings of light with two bright spots on the leading edge of the outer ring.   As my girlfriend and I passed the binoculars back and forth, it continued to slow down ! further until it came to a complete stop (relative to the stars in the binocular's field of view) at 9:43pm.  We continued to take turns with the binoculars in complete amazement.   I then decided to go to my neighbor's house to show them this amazing object in the sky.  The parents were out for the evening, but their three kids, their babysitter and I went out onto their back deck.  Everyone had a couple good looks at it.  It was still frozen in place in the sky, however the bright spots on the outer ring of light were on the other side, there were more of them and a little less bright.   I then returned to my house to retrieve and set up my telescope.  I knew it would take about 5 minutes to assemble so I went back to my deck to view the object again.  Now, at 9:53pm, it had started traveling back very slowly in the opposite direction, now going from West to East.  We watched it travel slowly for three minutes, until 9:56pm.  Then we both looked down to talk to each other, ! looked back up and it was nowhere to be seen.  A minute later, at 9:57 pm, we spotted the International Space Station, traveling West to East, across the northern sky.  We continued to search the sky for the object off-and-on for another hour, until 11pm, but never saw it again. In total we viewed this object for over 15 minutes.  I would estimate it was at an altitude comparable to that of satellites orbiting the earth. I have been an avid stargazer for over 30 years that can easily distinguish the planets (by name) from stars with the naked eye, easily spot satellites and have viewed the International Space Station many times, but this was a truly unique object and experience.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

4 greenish-blue lights rotating around a red light, brief &quotmeteor-like&quot sighting;2016-11-11 19:30:00;~7 seconds;4 greenish-blue lights rotating around a red light, brief &quotmeteor-like&quot sighting Driving along 64 Westbound, about 1 mile east of Raleigh East Airport (W17).  Saw a bright greenish-blue light (with a slight trail) appear about 10 degrees over the horizon (nearly directly west), RAPIDLY moving downward to the ground and disappearing.  I assumed this was a meteor and made a joke about it being either a meteor, a missile or an UFO. Within 10-20 seconds of this, the light reappeared at an elevation of about 40 degrees, still west of us.  It appeared to be a series of 4 extremely bright greenish-blue lights forming a circle around a dim red light.  The 4 lights were rapidly rotating around the red light (at ~15 RPM).  This object rose rapidly, made a turn to the right (north) and suddenly shot back down to the earth (nearly identical to the original sighting but at MUCH closer range). Distance, size and speed is hard to calculate at night (and with an object of unknown size).  That said, the speed at which the object moved was roughly that of a fast moving meteor burning up in the atmosphere.  The object was also much larger on the second sighting, so I'd assume that we were much closer.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

I decieded to look outside and a bright light caught my eye.  It was white in color and it was moving just enough to look like it was just hanging there floating around.  I called two of my roomates to also look at it and they agreed it was moving but dissmissed it as a plane.  However, it was not moving nearly enough to be a plane it was in the same area the entire two hours.  Eventually I look outside around mid night and it was gone.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

In the clear sky ahead at about a 30 degree angle I saw 7-8 small perfect circles that were brilliant white.  First several – 4 or 5 of them on the left side of the asymmetrical group appeared to bounce. Then one perfect circle became elliptical and gray and appeared to join the right hand grouping of 3-4.  For a second or two, they appeared to be in formation with four circles forming a rectangle and three circles following as they moved slowly to the left and then suddenly disappeared. Sorry to have submitted twice but I think I inadvertently reported two different dates on the first submission.
