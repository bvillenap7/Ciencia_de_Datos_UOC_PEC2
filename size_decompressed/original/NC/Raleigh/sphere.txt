The light came through the window so bright it woke me up.  I could see them through the slats in the blinds from where I slept. I got out of bed twice to check and looked out of 2 different windows. It greatly distressed me because 3 moons just aren't natural.  I eventually fell back to sleep. I compared it the following night.  There was only one moon in the same location and time.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Loud Lowflying Large Object;2005-02-17 19:47:00;Seconds;Loud Lowflying Large Object I was sitting on the couch when i heard a very loud noise and felt the windows rattle. I rushed outside and saw the object flying extremely low and fast it made a relativley sharp 45 degree turn and disappered from the horizon. We frequently have military planes fly over our house but never one like this I did not recognize the engine sound or shape, instead of it having multiple lights it apeared to be one large light with a streak following it.

I continued to watch realizing it was not a jet, no navigation lights as well as being way too bright, the object was heading south east and passed directly over my house. I ran inside to tell my wife and daughter to come outside and look, the three of us watched as the object dissapered over the trees. The brightness of the object never changed, it was just as bright comming at us as it was going away from us, WOW, please tell me someone else saw this! It is hard to guess the altitude other than to say it was pretty low, however we could not hear any engin noise. I would sure love to know what we just saw.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

Unknown object seen in Raleigh, NC 8/2/2013.;2013-08-02 21:00:00;10 minutes;Unknown object seen in Raleigh, NC 8/2/2013. At 2100 EDT my friend and I were taking pictures of the lighted pyramid on top of one of the buildings.  We weer shooting pretty much due east. My camera was a Leica M9 with a 50mm f 1.4 shooting at ISO 160, f1.4 and speed around .,5 - .7 seconds. t was hand held. We observed a very large sphere behind the building, note the building edges cutoff the sphere. I took 4 pictures each had the object.  When I downloaded I found two more pictures that had it and they showed a movement from left to right or north to south. The pictures have been sent to and examined locally and no has any idea what it is. The camera had just been returned from Leica who had cleaned and aligned it. There was no filter. I'll be sending the pictures to the email address below. The raw DNGs are available.  There was a concert being held due south of us several blocks away at the Redhat amphitheater.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Two silent, pulsating red orbs slowly moving due north near downtown Raleigh at low altitude.;2014-02-14 21:45:00;3 minutes;Two silent, pulsating red orbs slowly moving due north near downtown Raleigh at low altitude. I witnessed two reddish/orange (color was pulsating) spheres traveling across the horizon at a slow rate of speed in a direction vector approximately due North.  From my location, the estimated distance of the orbs were approximately less than 1 mile at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft.  They moved in tandem, one trailing the other, but still within close proximity of the lead sphere.  They emiited no sound.  At first glance, I thought they could be aircraft approaching RDU Airport, but realized no noise after a few moments had passed, and the light emission was much greater than normal markers and strobes on a typical aircraft.   The weather was clear and cold. Stars were clearly visible in the background.  I see a lot of air traffic overhead and am confident in my ability to identify various military and civilian aircraft.  These flying objects did not display any visual or audible characteristics of any military or conventional aircraft.  Conclusion.....UFO's!  Without a doubt!;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Blue light in the dusk sky turns red on video that hovers and changes directions and then descends.;2015-07-07 21:00:00;5 minutes;Blue light in the dusk sky turns red on video that hovers and changes directions and then descends. I was walking my sisters dog around the subdivision when I noticed a bright blue circular light from the corner of my eye.  I paid it a little attention because it was the biggest light in the sky and I felt it didn't belong there.  As the dog was relieving herself I noticed the object began to move and that's when I pulled out my IPhone and began recording.  The sphere then turned red and began moving slowly back the opposite way.  It then paused and hovered over the trees and shot straight down behind the trees .;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035

Very shiny sphere-like object in the sky dropping/hovering slowly then GONE!;2016-02-02 15:00:00;5-10 seconds;Very shiny Sphere like object in the sky dropping/hovering slowly then GONE! I am a 48 year old woman who works full time for a Non-Profit Energy Efficiency Company.  I was talking with a co-worker about what I saw while driving to my son's house on 2/2/16. She recommended that I report it here, so here it goes!   I was driving on Buck Jones Road going to my son's house (toward Cary, NC).  It was a nice sunny afternoon when a shiny, sphere-like object caught my eye in the sky to my left.  It appeared to be floating very slowly downward and I watched it for approx. 5-10 whole seconds.   I passed a couple of large trees on my left that blocked my view for a mere second and once I passed them, the object was nowhere to be found.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Object 300 meters in the air, crossing the sky like a rocket opens the walls of earth and explodes into thin air leaving just a trial;2016-08-13 05:15:00;~30 seconds;Object 300 meter in the air crossing the sky like a rocket opens the walls of earth and explodes into thin air leaving just a trial At about 5:15 am on 8/13/2016, just before the sunrise, about 300 meters in the air above highway 40 an object cross the sky at the speed of a rocket.  My first thought was to be afraid fearing that it was a missel of some kind however certain things happen in the course of 30 seconds that were beyond human capabilities in my opinion.  This option let behind it a trial of what appeared to be smoke similar to what a jet does as it crosses the sky only this option was moving so fast it appeared to be opening the earth around it.  When it reached what seemed to be its peak it exploded into thin air.  It look like I had just seen a black circler option open the walls of earth n disappear.  I had to share this with someone because the trail of smoke remained in the air for a few seconds after the object exploded into thin air.  I'm a truck driver I see things shoot a cross the air all the time but I've never seen anything like this before in my life it seem impossible what I witnessed.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
