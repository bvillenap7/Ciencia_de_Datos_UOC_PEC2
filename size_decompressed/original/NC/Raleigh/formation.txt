Looked like rectangle parachutes but nobody was under the canopies, objects never desended.;2004-10-17 18:15:00;5 minutes;Looked like rectangle parachutes but nobody was under the canopies, objects never desended. I was looking at new auto's at a local dealership and looked overhead and saw 4 rectangle blue and red objects. To the right of these objects was a larger off-white object with darker color on the bottom of it. I estimate these objects to be at approximately 5 or 6 thousand feet high. They were staying in a formation type configuration except for the off-white object which seemed to move at it's own will staying in close relation to the other 4 objects. When I first spotted these I thought they were skydivers that opened their shoots real high, that's what it looked like initially. The four smaller objects seemed to be travelling with the winds aloft but the larger object seemed to be able to control itself. Being a pilot I've flown airplanes for the past twenty five years and I've NEVER seen anything like this. I could'nt even sleep last night thinking about it. I observed this activity for at least five minutes until the objects slowly disappeared from sight. Sky conditions were perfectly clear, visibility unlimited.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Three lights moving faster then everything I have seen.;2012-11-25 07:25:00;1 minute;Three lights moving faster then everything I have seen. I was sitting on my back porch having a cigarette as we donâ€™t smoke inside.  I was looking at the stars as I do always and observed 3 lights moving very fast from north to south in a straight pattern they were white.   I have been observing the sky for many years and never saw any thing like this before.   Please feel fee to contact me at 980-((telephone number deleted)). Thanks,  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness requests that we call him, but then provides telephone numbers that don't seem to be accessible.  PD));35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Lights seen above downtown Raleigh,;2013-09-28 21:45:00;1-2 minutes;Lights seen above downtown Raleigh On Saturday, September 28th at 9:45 PM, I was attending an outdoor concert at the downtown Raleigh amphitheatre when my wife pointed to the sky to the right of the stage.   A series of amber lights were floating slowly across the sky, north to south at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  There were probably 6-8 of them and they appeared for a minute or two.  I did not see where they went because they went behind the stage where my view was blocked. I assumed that they might be flares the fire department might have been using to test wind direction for the fireworks show that was scheduled later that night but the fire department told me it doesn't use flares in this manner. A check with the 911 center showed no calls reporting lights or flares in the downtown area during that time. A Google Maps view of the area is here: https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ll=35.773562,-78.642111&spn=0.001668,0.002331&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=35.773471,-78.642115&panoid=SBItjg_tPtd3F2O27AGl0g&cbp=12,304.59,,1,0.91   The lights appeared about 10 degrees above the buildings in the background, somewhere over the intersection of Dawson St. and Cabarrus St, and moved slowly from right to left.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Looked like moving stars in perfect V shaped formation and moving North across the sky at high speed until it dissappeared.;2015-01-21 19:10:00;15 seconds;looked like moving stars in perfect &quotV&quot shaped formation and moving North across the sky at high speed until it dissappeared. We were on our patio talking and one of us looked up and said look, what is that?  I looked up to see a boomerang shaped object in perfect formation with many white lights.   To me it looked like a perfect bird formation flying high and glowing.  It seemed too high to be birds and they were glowing light fluorescent.   It also looked like stars in a perfect V-formation, moving across sky towards the North.   One of us walked and kept up with it and it got smaller and smaller and then disappeared. It made no sound whatsoever.  It seemed to be moving faster than an airplane.   I am 54 years old and have never seen anything like this before.  This is my first UFO sighting.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Three objects with white and red collision lights following each other N Raleigh, no sound.;2015-12-15 20:30:00;3-4 minutes;Three objects with white and red collision lights following each other N Raleigh, no sound. Went outside and saw what looked like 3 aircraft following each other, with red and white collision lights.  Came from West and headed S/SE.   Odd thing was they seemed to be flying low, but you couldn't hear any type of engines, propellers, etc.   They seemed to loosely follow each other but were also in very close proximity to each other.   I am guessing they were at approx 2500' msl...very bizarre. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
3 lights single object.;2018-10-31 22:00:00;3:00;3 lights single object Saw 3 lights moving in unison, slowly in the same direction over my neighborhood. It was heading West. 3 lights blinking one at a time from West to East. Light blinking repeated once a second in total for all 3 lights blinking in a loop - 1,2,3 - 1,2,3  No engine sounds.  Looked extremely wide/long from our view. The light's rate of blinking sort of looks like normal aircraft.  Only there were 3 lights, and all 3 lights moved together, and their blinking pattern was synced up as if highlighting a single shape.  Unclear if disc/chevron/whatever. If it was 3 helicopters, they did a really good job going at the same speed in the same direction, really really slow.  I've seen normal helicopters flying over my house before.  Lights look different, and I can hear the engines. Only other simplified guess I can make is some kids tied 3 drones together with a really really long fishing line.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was more than 1 to 3 miles long.  I'm no pilot or anything.  So my ability to judge the distance/speed/size is based on only my understanding that a traffic light is as big as I am close up.
