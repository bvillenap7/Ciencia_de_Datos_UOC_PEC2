Diamond-shaped object glowing in morning sky.;2014-01-25 07:27:00;1-2 seconds;Diamond-shaped object glowing in morning sky At 7:27 AM Saturday, I was running late to meet my family for breakfast in downtown Raleigh.  As I hurriedly turned south onto Blount Street from Peace Street, I spotted a very bright object in the eastern sky, roughly above Oakwood Cemetery.  It seemed to be stationary and diamond-shaped.  It was about the size of my pinky thumbnail held at arms length.  The top half was extremely shiny, almost mirror-like, while the bottom half glowed brilliant amber.  The sun was rising behind it at the time and I couldn't tell if the sunrise was reflecting off of it or the glow came from the object itself.  If it was reflecting sunlight at that time of day, the object must have been very large and very high in the sky.  My sense was that it was reflecting sunlight. I turned my attention to the road and back and lost sight of it in that brief time.  Had I not already been late that morning I would've gone looking for it. This is the second unexplained object I've seen over Raleigh in four months.  A report of a similar object seen over Raleigh two days prior prompted me to file this one.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
