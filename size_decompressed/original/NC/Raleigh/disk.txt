UFO seen in 1975 on a desserted hwy. in NC;1975-07-15 21:00:00;8 Min;UFO seen in 1975 on a desserted hwy. in NC It was summer, in 1975 when an object followed our car for miles on an empty highway road and the UFO followed us for 15 minutes so we stopped and pulled off of the road and all three of us got out and the UFO pulled up beside us and stopped and hovered above the tree tops about 250 meters away from us and the UFO had multicolored lights that flashed around the mid-section sequencially, Purple,red,white with weird speckles of light inside of it,yellow,green, etc. It just hovered for a long time and the lights turned purple and the lights reversed direction and and flashed in the opposite direction. Then it started to land just behind a few trees that were widely spaced apart and it landed on the lawn in a field across from us which was approx. 250 meters from where we were at, and we got scared and got back in our VW Beetle (New) and we got out of there. It was very terrifying at the time and we were very scared about what happened. There was no one around at all, no cars, people, etc. Nothing at all. I just wanted to share this experience because I think we all have been in shock and disbelief for so long about this experience. I am just now decideing to share my information about this incident.

Close view of stationary disk, top and side visible, prior to rapid its acceleration and departure;2000-12-12 07:00:00;5-7 minutes;Close view of stationary disk, top and side visible, prior to rapid its acceleration and departure my 8yr old son was standing outside in our driveway waiting for me to leave to go to school.  He was out there for a few minutes, 3-5 minutes before I came out. As I came out I could hear a the sound of humming like a jet engine. I stepped off my porch onto the driveway and heard a loud close, rushing sound speed away. I looked up and saw a shape moving off over the trees. I thought it must have been a fighter jet. When I heard the sound my son said,  Mom did you see that plane?, I said, well, I heard it. He said, It was weird 'cause it was round. I said oh, did you see it?. Reply  Yeah I was watching it for a while. I said, Did it move slowly? Reply, No, it was just sitting there looking at me, then it flew away. Then he said,  It had these two things sticking out the front. It had a red light on one side and a green one on the other. Quite non-chalantly he said, If I see it again, I'll point to it for you We had very low cloud cover that morning. I wondered if he saw a plane in the clouds. I asked if he saw a fuzzy shape in the clouds but he insisted it was a clear large shape under the clouds. It could not have been more than 300 ft up. He drew me a picture of it. Then he drew another one and I helped him to label it.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
4 Clear Disk-shaped UFOs over Raleigh, N.C..;2014-01-23 12:00:00;3 seconds;4 Clear Disk-shaped UFOs over Raleigh, N.C. I saw 4 disks in the clear sky.  I took a very clear photo of what I witnessed.  I was on the 10th floor of a tall office building when I walked out on the balcony to look at some unusual clouds.   I was on an interview and was immediately called back in, but not before I could take a picture.  I didn't look at the picture until later that day when I remembered how strange it was.   I looked at it closely and DID NOT alter it at all.  I showed a few friends and family members and the feedback was all the same.   Nobody could explain it at all!  I'm completely baffled and really would like some answers to this strange sighting.   The objects looked like disks with a hole in the center.  One was extremely large.  (Maybe the size of a Walmart store).   The other three around it were much smaller but in a triangular formation and slightly above the larger one.  (I emailed the photo to ufocntr@nwlink.com)   Please get back to me.  Thank you.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
