Bright light flash and satellite like movements in night sky over NW Raleigh, North Carolina on the evening of February 19, 2014.;2014-02-19 18:15:00;45 seconds;Bright light flash and satellite like movements in night sky over Northwest Raleigh, North Carolina on the evening of February 19, 2014. The night of February 19, 2014 was the first warm clear day/evening in almost a week.  At 7:15pm, I was walking outside to my car while looking up appreciating the clear night sky. While I was scanning the sky an extremely bright flash of light caught my attention.  The flash itself was very reminiscent of a signal flash you would get with mirrors. There was a single flash of light then the light/object continued across the sky in a north east to west trajectory.  If I hadn't witnessed the flash of light I would have mistaken it for a satellite.  It was heading on a straight path with a constant speed and brightness for about 15-20 seconds then it completely vanished.  I searched the sky couldn't see movement or lights anywhere along the trajectory path that it would have been on.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
