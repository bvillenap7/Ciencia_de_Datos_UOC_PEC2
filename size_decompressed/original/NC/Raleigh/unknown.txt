((HOAX??))  saw 5or 6 lights circling overhead object  blocked out stars.;1975-07-22 21:00:00;25 seconds;saw 5or 6 lights circling overhead object  blocked out stars. object was silent and very large, myself and a friend were walking in the same area  we always walked, when I noticed 5 or 6 lights moving in a circle .The lights were white in color.I do not remember looking up at all, I do know I was frozen in fear,it was like they wanted me to see it. When I looked out around the lights it blocked out the stars     it was a clear night,so I was sure what I was seeing,   After 15 or 20 seconds I told my friend to look up,when he did the object went straight up and left the earth,  It did not vanish,we were both seeing the same thing,we took off running screaming,that night we  lost about 4 or 5 hours of time.After we saw whatever it was for some reason we were wore out and we just went home and went to sleep. The next morning my friends forehead look like someone put a softball under his skin,also I had a hole in my hip that had some kind of black object that looked like a rock . It was there for about 20 years just under the skin and then it seemed like it vanished,it may still be there.I have been having a lot problems both physical and emotional,I must tell someone.

Bright light/hovering craft seen in raleigh near state fair around midnight.;2009-10-18 00:00:00;2 mins;Bright light/hovering craft seen in raleigh near state fair around midnight. Driving saw an incredibly bright light in the distance - pretty low in the sky. Originally thought it might be a helicopter or plane. As I got closer I noticed it wasn't moving, but simply hovering. It was too big to be a helicopter. It had red lights on the tips of its wings and one big, very bright white light in the middle. FREAKY!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a celestial body, or an approaching airliner??  PD));35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
Observed a non conforming craft south of Raleigh moving west to east and then circling north toward Raleigh center.;2011-11-30 18:45:00;20 minutes;Observed a non conforming craft south of Raleigh moving west to east and then circling north toward Raleigh center. While traveling in a car, approximately 1 mile north of the 401/55 intersection, traveling north on Rt 401, two white lights where spotted in the dark evening sky, to the east of a tower with red blinking lights in the vicinity of Ten-Ten road, but the craft was an unknown distance north of the tower.  Lights were originally believed to be that of a military transport on approach to Fort Bragg/Pope Army Airfield, until it was noticed that the craft did not have any blinking navigational aircraft lights.  Observer lost visual contact when traveling in the low spot south of 401/Ten-Ten Road intersection. While waiting for the traffic signal to change at the 401/Ten-Ten Road intersection, the two craft lights were noticed moving east toward the Clayton radio/TV towers, one behind the other, parallel to the ground.   The two white lights appeared to be moving as part of one object and maintained a uniform distance during travel.  Rate of movement was faster than a helicopter.  Object was traveling approximately 20-25 degrees above the horizon. Observer spotted craft a third time after passing Wake Tech campus on 401.  Craft appeared to be making a sweeping flat turn, full circle, back toward south Raleigh, approaching from the south.   Observer lost visual at approximately the intersection of 401/Ransdell Road. Observer spotted the craft a fourth time while traveling in the vicinity of Phillips Farm.  Craft appeared to be banking (left light was higher than the right light), lined up for flight over Garner/Raleigh moving at an accelerating speed to points north.  Observer lost visual due to trees at the top of the hill north of the Phillips Farm. By the time the observer made it to the intersection of 401/Old Stage Road the craft was no longer visible.  Observer was unable to determine if he was looking at one craft with two lights, or two crafts with one light each.  Brightness of the craft lights did not appear to change during the course of the observations and always appeared to point out from the craft, even when accelerating away to the north.  Lights were not observed pointing toward the ground.  No noise was heard.  Observation period from first sighting to last sighting was approximately 20 minutes.;35.8355650359518;-78.6399972907035
A flying object at 29000 feet.  ((NUFORC Note:  REPORT FROM COMMERCIAL AIRLINE PILOT.
