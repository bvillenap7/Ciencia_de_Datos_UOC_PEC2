White cigar shaped UFO flew over small patch of sky I was watching at 7:28 AM.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-27 07:28:00;10 seconds;White cigar shaped UFO flew over small patch of sky I was watching at 7:28 AM I was boredly watching the sky, waiting for the bus.  The sky was only a patch, not a big open area. Since I'm an astronomy lover, I thought to myself, What if I saw a UFO?.  I had seen an assumed UFO two years back, but it didn't look anything like this one.   Anyways, I suddenly noticed this one white, shortish cigar object flying across the patch of sky slightly faster than a plane.  The other people around were busy socializing.  I narrowed my eyes, hearing my heart thump in my chest as I grew more excited.   I grabbed my phone, and the cigar-shaped object was almost out of view.  I opened my camera as fast as I could, but it was too late, as the object had already flown out of view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Short white cigar shaped object;2019-07-25 09:00:00;30 seconds;Short white cigar shaped object I saw this white short cigar shaped object moving at a steady speed across the clear sky and at one point the morning sun reflected off of it and it was very bright.   Then I went to take a picture with my phone and I couldnâ€™t spot it anymore when It should have still been in sight.   There was no sound either.
