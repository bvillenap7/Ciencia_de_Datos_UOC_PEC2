Metallic Triangular object hovers over Valdese;2001-10-15 17:00:00;2 minutes;Metallic Triangular object hovers over Valdese I was returning from Hickory, NC with dinner for my mom & myself from Olive Garden - it was dusk.  I turned from the main road into our driveway and I saw an object about 100 feet behind the house, hovering over top of the woods behind the house.  I quickly parked the car & ran inside and said to my mom, get out here now.  By the time we both were outside, the object was hovering right over the driveway - maybe 20 feet above the telephone pole, which is beside the driveway.  The object was triangular in shape, was larger than a car and was metallic.  It made no noise, and glided through the air unlike any other aircraft I am familiar with.  The object had about 4 or 5 lights on it - multicolored.  After we watched it for about a minute, it continued to glide across the sky until it disappeared in the distance.  The object moved from North (over the woods) to the South near High Peak Mountain. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.7504;-81.5623

Never changing altitude at about 200 ft.  A light hum .... I swear there is a helicopter so low right now it's caught my attention amidst this crazy morning. I hope we don't sound crazy right now, my hands are still shakin. The craft had3 intense lights shining white, and at the back between the two large lights were three colored lights( blue green and red or red green red) I hope others seen it.;35.7504;-81.5623
