We were riding in SUV returning from Walmart and were on a very dark, back country road.  Sky was bright with a half moon visible.  Not very cloudy. Just moved from left to right very very quickly...white light only...came into view and then left as fast as it appeared...much to fast to be a jet plane, parallel to horizon and would not have been a falling star or comet...VERY BRIGHT and VERY FAST  I am 57, my son is 25 and his girlfriend is 23.  All saw the same thing and I have NEVER witnessed anything like it in my life.  A totally unique experience.  Strange indeed.;35.8498;-79.8058000000001
