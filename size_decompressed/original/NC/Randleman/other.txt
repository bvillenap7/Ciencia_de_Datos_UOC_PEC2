It appearred to have a lime green glow to it, with spirling grated lines.  I allertted my son,husband and his friend to what I was wittnessing, and as we approached closer to see it, as if it had noticed we had seen it, running closer to it, it shot off like a bullet, as fast as a blink of an eye.  We were stunned as to what we saw, didn't know what it could be, we were asking ,what was that?  My son still ask's me about it, since it was really strange to us. We do know it was something not of this world. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in June 2005.
