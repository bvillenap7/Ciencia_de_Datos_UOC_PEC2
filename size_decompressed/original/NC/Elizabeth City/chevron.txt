Sun had just set. Just left a store, turning in parking lot, looked at water tower, saw object. Direction NE, Angle from horizon about 45 deg., object traveling east, trajectory about -20 deg from the horizontal. Traveled in straight line, moderate speed, completely disappeared after about 10 sec - instantly, no fade. Weather: low 40's F, completely clear - not a cloud, just after sunset - sky still had enough light to drive without lights. Object description: a flying 90 deg angle (chevron?), at first thought it was a flock of geese, then realized it was either one object with alternating dark and light areas or was a very tight formation of dark (square shaped) objects that moved as one. No contrail. This is the first time I have ever seen a UFO. This thing was really strange - it kind of disturbed me.;36.2959466898956;-76.2432606271779
