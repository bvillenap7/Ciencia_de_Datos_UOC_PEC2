It was appx. 9:40 PM.  I was alone.  Something red in the sky caught my eye.  I stopped walking toward my vehicle and looked up.  I watched for a few seconds not really able to process what I was seeing.  I saw a light colored, thin disc/circle shaped object flying above my head at a fairly slow pace.  I vivedly remember searching for wings or the parts of a helicopter something that would indicate to me it was an identifiable aircraft. There were none.  I noted there was no sound.  There was a reddish glow around the disc.  It did not blink. About 4 seconds into watching, I realized what I was seeing.   I ran back into the house and yelled for my relative who came out just in time to see the it as it dipped below pine trees and disappeared.

Saucer-shaped chrome vessel, hovering near wind turbines in Elizabeth City, NC.;2016-08-13 06:57:00;3 minutes;Saucer shaped chrome vessel hovering near wind turbines in Elizabeth City, NC August 13, 2016, 6:57AM.  My background:  I am currently a private investigator and former law enforcement officer. I was traveling northbound on US 17 in Elizabeth City, NC.  A wind farm is under construction and wind turbines are being constructed on some of the massive areas of farm land at that location.  I was looking to my left and checking out how many turbines were under construction when I noticed an object above the height of the turbines and a little to my north west. The object was of a classic “saucer” shape with a domed top.  It was silver in color and reflected the sun like chrome.  It appeared to just hover and then slowly glide through the air.  There was no visible exhaust and no sound noticed.  No lighting on the vessel was observed. I thought to myself, “I need to stop and video this.”  I looked to my right to see if the right lane was clear so I could pull to the side of the road.  I looked back up and the vessel had vanished.  There was no sign of it anywhere. I have seen other questionable lights and lighted objects at night but this was my first daytime sighting that I can say for certain was a UFO. I am also posting this, wondering if anyone else observed the same object that morning.;36.2959466898956;-76.2432606271779
