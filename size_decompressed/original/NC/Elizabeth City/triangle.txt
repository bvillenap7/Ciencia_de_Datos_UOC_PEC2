I was out for a smoke looking up at the sky because I noticed it was a very clear sky with bright stars.  I noticed the triangular craft appear seemed like out of nowhere, it had sudden sharp moves and was still at times briefly almost like it were noticing me.  The craft was no more than maybe a mile high, that's my guess. It did seem to appear very close.  I could see probably 3 to 4 lights located on it.  What made me know it wasn't one of our coast guard crafts was because this thing had a reverse at times.  It did take off so quickly that it was gone as fast as it appeared from the start. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) sorry for the misunderstanding it was on the previous night.  If I put the wrong date, I apologize for the confusion.  and this was not my only sighting.  I seemed to have encounters every since I was a teenager, of the same kind of craft. same in distance away from me. my brother has witnessed it with me. we are firm believers, others think we are crazy or make it up. my fathers car was actually lifted off the road years ago when he drove over a bright light. my dad is a christian and does not lie, he testified in church of this encounter. you might think this is crazy but I feel somewhat of a connection when I have these encounters. I apologize for babbling on.  But it was the previous day.  I stumbled upon your site, didnt know I could report such occurences. I will be ready with camera for future encounters. Thank you kindly.
