Circular hole in the clouds.;2011-12-05 19:00:00;2 hours;Circular hole in the clouds. Last night I looked up becasue I heard a helicopter flying overhead, and noticed an Apache flying toward the field I was in.   Once seeing that, I noticed the clouds above me were in a perfect circle, as if they were pushed outward by something.  The helicopter circled around the area until about two hours later when the clouds had moved outward far enough to disperse.   The moon was in the exact center of the opening in the clouds, however I could not see any of the usual stars that would have been in that area.;35.1223631578947;-78.9608631578948
