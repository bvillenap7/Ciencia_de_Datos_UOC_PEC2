Four lights seen above ft. bragg;2012-06-06 06:00:00;not sure;four lights seen above ft. bragg At 0600 on 6the june 2012, several soldiers in my unit talked about the weird lights we saw that morning as we were coming in the gate.  We are all airborne infantry soldiers.  Four lights hovered in the air for more than thirty minutes after we had first witnessed them. We don't know exactly when they were gone because we had to go to formation and they were not able to be seen from where we form up at.  They were not flares, they were not aircraft any of us are familiar with. At one point, they moved at impossible angles without  sound.;35.1223631578947;-78.9608631578948
