Two triangle  UFO’s over Ft. Bragg.;1998-09-20 01:15:00;20 minutes;Two triangle  UFO’s over Ft. Bragg In the fall of 1998, I was an Army SPC in the 82nd Airborne 1/325AIR.  During an airborne operation on Sicily drop zone located on Fort Bragg, NC, I seen two UFO’s back to back. I was placed on detail to collect parachutes during my units jump. The jump was going to take place around 01:30hrs.  I was in the middle of the drop zone laying on my back watching the stars on a clear night.  As I was looking up, a UFO at tree top level move slow overtop of me.  It look like a formation of helicopter. I was thinking it’s less then 30 minutes before the drop this is dangerous.  I then notice I can not  see between the formation of lights that formed a triangle.  I also noticed it made no sound and no rotor wash.  I then realized it was a UFO.  It continued to move slow until it looked like a star among the other stars on the horizon.  I could not take my eyes off it until a second UFO crosses over me just to my left side along the same path as the first one.  I watched it move slow until it looked like a star among the other stars on the horizon.  I then watched one blink then the other UFO would blink and they blink back and forth for about ten minutes.  They were still blinking when the drop started.  I lost track of them during the drop.  That morning when we were collecting the Parachutes I asked who had seen the strange objects/UFO’s.  One of the NCO’s told me he had seen them and told me not to say anything about it.  When I got back to the barracks, I was relieved to find that ! the UFO event was reported on the local news.

On I-95 N getting close to Fort Bragg exits. I noticed what looked like a plane far off with a bright light.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-13 05:38:00;10-15 minutes;We were traveling back home on I-95 northbound, getting close to Fort Bragg exits. I noticed what looked like a plane far off with a bright light.  I watched the object while driving closer until I realized it was a triangle UFO.  I shook my husband and said look at that.  It's not a plane.  It's a triangle.  It was silver in color with bright white lights on each point.  The center had a red flashing light.  It was hovering to the right of the interstate facing traffic going southbound.   My husband blew it off like it was something new from the military and said it was cool.  I watched the object until I could no longer see it in my mirrors.  It never moved.  Just hovered. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
