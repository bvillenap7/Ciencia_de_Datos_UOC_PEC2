We saw what looked like 2 or 3 orange lights in the distance.   At first we thought they were hot air ballon flares as they looked like small fires fading in and out of visibility.  After a few minutes they went away but then they came back.  There were again 2 or 3, but they had changed position and 2 of them were hovering in a straight line parallel to the ground. In the background it looked like a smaller light was flying around very quickly.  These lights faded out as well and again returned but much closer.  The colors were still orange but seemed to take on a little red Coloring as well. one of the lights split into 3 smaller lights and seemed to be in a kind of triangular disk shape, almost like the bottom of a craft.  These lights faded out soon after and then we went inside.  Our parents were out on the beach and saw the same lights we did.   All of us are very rational and level headed, but we all agreed no one knew what the lights were. It was very strange.;35.3521;-75.5104

Orange fireballs create a V-formation over beach at Avon.;2015-06-02 21:30:00;45 minutes;Orange fireballs create a V-formation over beach at Avon. At approximately 9:30pm on 6/2/15 I was with a group of people fishing and having a small fire on the beach in Avon.  The night was warm, the weather clear except for some small patches of clouds and a little haze but the moon was out and visibility was good. I was looking over the water when I noticed a bright orange object had just appeared a good distance down the coast and over the water.  At first I thought it was a low flying plane that had broken out of the hazy clouds, but then the object did a short, quick dip down and suddenly one object “blinked” or “split” into six to eight other similar orange objects and into a V-formation.  This formation moved across the sky for a few moments and then almost in perfect unison “blinked out” and disappeared.  Of the 12 or so people on the beach, only myself and one other witness witnessed this particular part of the event. Five minutes later, at about 9:35pm, two orange fireballs appeared in the sky closer down the beach to my location.  These two craft came out of the clouds flying nearly parallel and almost mimicking each other’s movements.  They looked very much like planes at first, but then they would pulse bright fireball orange on and off.  They sped across the sky inland, at one point coming to a complete stop and hovering for about a 20 second time period.  The two craft then reversed and started heading back over the sea where they shone bright orange and then blinked out and disappeared. The odd thing about this second part of the sighting, which all members of my party now witnessed, was there was an actual sound for a brief time.  Whether or not the sound came from the craft or not, I cannot say, but it was deep and sounded like a jet engine at first, but then it kind of mimicked the sound of the surf and waves of the beach, but noticeably louder.  It was at the time of this sound that the craft disappeared. One more of these orange balls were spotted well inland at approximately 10:15pm moving over Avon and its beach houses.  It too moved well across the sky only at one point coming to a near complete stop and hovering.  It stayed like that for a few seconds before moving on then blinking out and disappearing.  Three people witnessed this. Fireworks, military flares, light effects off the clouds—this was none of that. These things seemingly moved with purpose and intelligence.  I have never seen anything like it.  Oddly enough, it was noticed that hardly any commercial aircraft or aircraft of any kind were in the skies on this night. After some quick research and checking online to see if anyone else saw what I did, I found on Youtube some footage taken in 2012 at Myrtle Beach which shows exactly what I saw, but I saw a more intricate V-formation of sorts.
