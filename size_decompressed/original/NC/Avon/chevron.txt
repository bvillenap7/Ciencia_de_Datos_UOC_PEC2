THIS OBJECT DIDNT HAVE ANY SOUND.;1998-10-20 20:30:00;3 min;THIS OBJECT DIDNT HAVE ANY SOUND. I remember if it were lastnight. I was smoking a cigarett on my front porch gazing towards the northeast and i noticed 3 lights simutaniously drifting slowly downward over some oceanfront property. after a second or two it shot back up and continued to follow the coast line south. the funny thing about it was it didnt make any sound what so ever and it freaked me out! I never came out with this till now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));35.3521;-75.5104
