Pulsating array of several lights traveling in unison;2015-10-08 20:30:00;2-3 minutes;Pulsating array of several lights traveling in unison I was taking the dogs out one last time before bedtime, and I always look at the stars.  Last night, I saw a very large array of blinking lights moving eastward.  I'm thinking it had to be very large because it seemed far away and behind some clouds, and was still wide, I'm thinking maybe 100 feet or so.  There were approximately 8 lights, and the color was a faded pink.  The lights seemed to be in the shape of a boomerang, or a wide v. It was going behind a cloud and was extremely hard to see.  I called my husband out, but it had gone behind the clouds so much that he didn't see it.  I had no time to grab a camera, as it had disappeared shortly after that.  I am used to seeing airliners, Coast Guard helicopters, c130's, even the occasional blimp, and this sighting was nothing like that.;36.1685;-76.3731
