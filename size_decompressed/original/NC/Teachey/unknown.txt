a light beamed down from the sky onto the ground;2009-09-12 20:30:00;2 mins;a light beamed down from the sky onto the ground one day while i was outside , along with three other people , i saw this weird light beaming down from the sky onto the ground at an angle. The light never moved. It remained in the same place.  Then slowly the light began to dim until it slowly disappeared remaining in the same spot.  As my sister ran to get my camera the light was gone by the time she had gotten back. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));34.7689;-78.0188
