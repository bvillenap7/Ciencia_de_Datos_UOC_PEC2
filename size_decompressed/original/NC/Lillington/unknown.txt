Sound was like a turbo prop but speed was incredible. I was an army UH-60 helicopter crewchief in 1986. My area has some type of aircraft flying day or night at some point, be it UH60's, AH64, C-130's, C-17's and once in a while a C-5 plus other misc aircraft. I know the typical flight paths over the course of 22 years and this was not one that I have ever seen before. I was in my bedroom getting ready to work out when I herd what I believed was a C-130.  I was standing by the window so I pulled back the blinds thinking I would see a C-130 but to my surprise all I seen was a brilliant rear illumination as if there was a side by side Solar eclipse about 350 feet off the ground.  The sound was like a turbo props low powerful hum but not quite the same.   speed was incredible. My mind started processing what I just seen.  Then I realized the flight path was all wrong!  The brilliant rear illumination and the sound did not match. I have no idea of the size but it appeared to be half the size of a C-130 but not like a V-22. It was not wasting time where ever it was going. It was flying from the SW to NE. My wife only heard it.
