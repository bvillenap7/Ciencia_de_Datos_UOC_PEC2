Objects travelling westward, bright lights revovling.;1999-10-26 07:05:00;approx 2 min;Objects travelling westward, bright lights revovling. I live in a area that is in a major flight path, so I know the what a number of planes look like.  This morning before the sun was up, I saw 2 objects travelling westward above the trees.  The had revolving lights that were red & white, some appeared to be VERY bright as they seemed to be moving in a pattern around the objects.  They also seemed to be travelling way to slow to be a plane (no noise could be heard).  I watched them until I couldn't see them anymore they disappeared over the horizon.  I also noticed a plane very far up in the sky as it was leaving a contrail.  If I held my thumb up to one of them it was actually twice the size in width.  Did anyone else notice these in the sky?

Small, rotating, seemingly faceted orb spotted flying more slowly that bird/planes, flew roughly NE,  ((anonymous report));2018-10-04 18:00:00;15-20 minutes;Small, rotating, seemingly faceted orb spotted flying more slowly that bird/planes, flew roughly NE, concurrent with Poplar Tent Rd. My husband spotted this object, which he described as a tiny stop light, while we were driving northeast along East Poplar Tent Rd, just after the I-85 interchange.  I assumed it might be a drone.  I caught a few glimpses in my driver side mirror and pulled into James Dorton Park to get a better view while my husband and kid went to the park.  I filmed for 6 minutes and observed the object slowly flying northeast but in a straight line concurrent with Poplar Tent Rd.  The object was slower than both birds and airplanes, and seemed to rotate and reflect sunlight, as if faceted.  It can barely be seen in my video and gets fainter as the capture continues.  After turning off my phone camera, I lost sight of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  See video from 04OC18.  PD));35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
