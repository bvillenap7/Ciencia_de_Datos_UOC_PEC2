Fork lift attacked by aliens craft;2003-04-21 20:00:00;10 minutes;Fork lift attacked by aliens craft I was finishing my shift over to the plant when I stepped out onto the dock behind a big pile of pallets to have a smoke.  I had this feeling I was being watched, and whirled around expecting to see my supervisor Jimbo standing there ready to bust me.  Instead I seen this purple light like those the power company installed over to my trailer, them what makes everything look purplish.  The ships was tear drop shaped like a Hershey's kiss with a round bottom.  They was this windshield that was all bowed in like it had been in a bad wreck or something.  Behind the windshields was two glowing lights, kind of like eyes in that movie The Big Scary Eyes of Hades.  They moved independent of one another, so I'm thinking they was not attached to the same being.  I dropped my blunt and tripped over a stack of pallets, sticking a rusty nail into my shin.  I was too scared to holler, so I run into the plant to tell ((name deleted)) the lift driver to help me.  ((name deleted)) drove the new battery-operated Caterpillar lift over, cause he never sets his big ass off that thing.  Since I could not speak from the fear, I pointed him to the light, which by now was glowing brighter. He drove the lift onto the dock when a blazing narrow beam of white light come down onto the forks.  The lift cut off and ((name deleted)) screamed like a woman.  Next thing I remember I was in the plant manager's office getting oxygen and a cool rag to my head.  ((name deleted)) still will not speak of this harrowing event.  I was given the remainder of the shift off with pay. ((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to have the second witness submit a report, as well.
