I saw a moving light  that disappeared into thin air on a clear night.;2002-02-12 20:08:00;4.minutes;I saw a moving light  that disappeared into thin air on a clear night. I was out on my deck having a smoke as I always do after dinner . I was looking up at the stars and I saw it over the top of my house. It was small and I thought it was a plane, I noticed it was moving very slowly, and was very dim . I have seen many planes that fly at high altitudes, but ,this you could tell was very high. I was thinking of  maybe a satelite . As I watched this thing it moved at the same rate of speed going from southwest to northeast(slower than a plane ) not taking my eyse off it I banged on the back door to tell my wife to hurry and come outside to see this. She did and saw the light but went back inside. I continued to watch the light and it seemed to speed up, About a minute later it just vanished.The sky was totally clear not a cloud in sight . Did anyone else see what I did ? ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the report is not inconsistent with a sighting of a typical satellite.  However, that is only a guess.  PD));35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
Bright yellowish circle staionary then rapidly moving, then disappearing altogether.;2011-11-11 20:45:00;5-8 minutes;Bright yellowish circle staionary then rapidly moving, then disappearing altogether. Driving down the road at night and saw a really BRIGHT dot/circle kinda yellow(looked like 1 single headlight) but really BRIGHT never have seen anything that bright.  We turned into a neighborhood and stopped in an empty culdasac.  We thought it was stationary for the first 45-70 seconds, then realized after it dimmed slightly that it was moving and very fast.  Turned around to go opposite way and another one was directly behind us and also moving very fast.  We continued down the road the way we were originally heading and the first one got super bright again and crossed over the road but farther up than us and disappeared.  The other one looked like it had changed shapes and resembled a very small yellow cresent moon.  And the moon it  self was almost full. we got home stood out in the driveway and realized there were like 10-15 planes and jets all over the skies going back and forth in the direction we saw these things.  I do not believe that was a coincedence.;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
I was driving to my house from my friend’s house which is about 15 minutes away from my house.

As I was driving I looked up at the sky (just looking at stars) when I noticed a really bright light that looked like a really bright star.  I proceeded to watch it as I was driving and it slowly disappeared out of sight.  One second this light was the brightest light in the sky and then it was completely gone.  I thought it had left but I watched the spot it was in for a few more seconds and it reappeared as bright as it was before and stayed there for 30 seconds to a minute and then it went away again.  It disappeared then reappeared 10-15 different times as I was making sure I didn’t lose sight of it so when I got home I could show my relatives.  They sat and watched it with me and we all saw it disappear and reappear many more times until we finally went inside but we never saw it leave so it could have been there for the next hour or so. This light didn’t move and it had a kind of shape to it but I couldn’t make it out because it looked so far away but it was so bright.  I honestly think it was some sort of craft or energy. I was relieved when it disappeared in front of my relatives so I wasn’t the only one who saw it.  It was definitely high in the sky because clouds were passing in front of it and dimming the light very slightly.;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
Bright light in the sky. Disappears and reappears.;2012-04-20 22:00:00;>1 hour;Bright light in the sky. Disappears and reappears. Ok I filed a previous report a week or 2 ago, maybe 3 about this same experience.  When I first saw this bright light a few weeks ago I was amazed which compelled me to file a report. I also showed my mom as soon as I got home.  This time I was dropping a couple of my buddies off when something just randomly compelled me to look up at the sky (which isn’t unusual I often look up at the sky trying to find something out of the ordinary).  The very first thing I looked at was what I thought to be a star…but then it disappeared out of sight as soon as I acknowledged it was there. I freaked out and my buddies thought I was going to run off the road but when I told them what I saw they thought I only saw an airplane or helicopter.  I pointed to where I saw it and there it was bright as day, far away though, they both watched it for about 30 seconds and it disappeared again.  The expressions and faces they made…priceless.  They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.  For me it was still exciting to say the least but it was the second time I’ve seen this so I was just relieved they had finally seen it too. Anyway this light stays in the same spot and doesn’t move.  It was actually not far at all from the spot I saw it last time, might have been the same place.  All I know is that it couldn’t have been a hovering helicopter, it was beyond the clouds. It couldn’t have been an airplane, it was stationary. It couldn’t have been a star, it disappeared and reappeared from sight. It couldn’t have been a satellite, or anything else I can logically think of except either a space craft of some sort or some type of energy in the sky….who knows? Someone or should I say some people know exactly what it is. Who knows maybe it could have been a space craft outside or inside our atmosphere and either was or was trying to communicate with someone or some people. Someone professional needs to investigate this and make it public because there is someone or some! thing out there, right here in quiet Concord, North Carolina.;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
Looking at the moon in a NW direction.  I suddenly noticed to my right side in a NNE direction an extremly bright light.;2013-05-14 22:59:00;20 seconds;I was looking at the moon in a north western direction when I suddenly noticed to my right side in a NNE direction an extremly bright light moving in a NNE directiion.   The light was light that of a diameter of a star,then as it traveled it seem to dim into almost nothing.  Then suddenly reappered brigter than before.  I have seen satelites,But can assure you it was not,nor a helicopter   Light was about the height a jet would fly at maximun alltitude.  This was not the ISS.I have never seen anything in the sky like this before.;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486

About 20 or 25 do them in no reticular formation they just found each other in the same direction not getting out of line at all they seem to be about a hundred feet above treetops.  they stretched out for probably a half a mile to a mile in the sky as they passed over my house they started going up higer in the air and disappeared one at a time.  There was never any sound at all none whatsoever.   I do have a picture on my phone;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
