He thought it was a plane but he watched it vanished after I ran to get a pair of binoculars.  When I came back it was gone.   So we watched again.  And another one came across the sky.  This time I got the binoculars up on time to see it.   It was an egged shaped object.  I saw it for about two seconds, long enough to indentify it as that shape.  I tried to get my friend over to see it in the binoculars, but by time he made it over, it had flickered out.   We both sat there for about 10 minutes, waiting on it to come back, but it never did.   I know for a fact what I saw wasn't a plane or helicopter of any thing I've ever seen. I'm not sure what else to say but I'm still in shock.
