Object changing colors over the Charlotte area;2010-04-11 22:18:00;45+ minutes;Object changing colors over the charlotte area At around 2200 hours I was sitting on my porch smoking when I saw a blinking star.  I didn't think much of it until I noticed it changing colors. I got a hold of four friends and my mother to see if they saw the same thing. Every person excluding my mother saw it as something out of our technology. The object in the sky kept changing colors several times every 30 seconds or so. They colors were green, red, blue, white, and maybe a few others. I knew it was not an airplane as it's flight pattern was not as our planes could do. It would raise altitudes and go from side to side at such great speeds our planes wouldn't stay intact.  I only got one quick glance at the actual object when it light up brightly one time and it was in a oval shape.  If i would have to guess the size I would say about three times the size of a commercial airplane. I will be sitting outside tonight around the same time I was last night.  If I see anything strange I will make sure to report it back here again.;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
A green fireball streaked down through the sky at a steep angle and disappeared;2013-08-19 23:30:00;10 seconds;A green fireball streaked down through the sky at a steep angle and disappeared I was driving north on Interstate 1-85 near exit 58.  Maybe 1 quarter mile from the exit,I saw a green oval object, glowing as if on fire - move from high in the sky on a downwards diagonal path - then then disappear before reaching ground level.  The object looked roughly oval, it was not round, but it did seem to have a firey glow around it.  Granted it was a foggy night - but the green light was not sharp and defined - the glow may have been due to the mist/fog in the air. I was nearing a commercial shopping area near the highway exit, and it looked as though the object would head right down into the shopping center area - but instead before it reached what would be ground level it disappeared in the fog. There is no airport at this exit, and the path was steep - it descended on a 45 degree angle.  That is, it did NOT move on an even path as an passing plan would, and it was too steep for any aircraft to descend.;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
UFO with bright spotlight on the front.;2015-08-09 03:00:00;30 seconds;UFO with bright spotlight on the front I was driving home when I saw a very bright light up above me in the sky.  It was pretty low to the ground, so that's why I became curious.  It seemed to have a really bright spotlight on the front.   As I kept driving, I saw the side of it and it had a few small, blinking lights.  It had a weird shape that was sort of like an elongated oval.;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
Bright, Oval Light in the Sky that hovered, and then disappeared quickly.;2019-10-15 18:45:00;5 Minutes;Bright, Oval Light in the Sky that hovered, and then disappeared quickly. During a drive I noticed an Oblique Oval in the sky.  It was brighter than anything I've seen and just continued to hover in one place for a matter of a couple of minutes. (Not sure how long it was there before I noticed it)  It did not move an inch, it seemed inhuman.  When the craft began to move it disappeared within a matter of seconds.  I watched it turn from a bright, non-moving object.  To a distant fading light within a good 5 to 10 seconds of movement.;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
