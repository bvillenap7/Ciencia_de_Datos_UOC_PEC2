They flew in the same trajectory about 45 to 60 seconds apart. It was cloudy and they were just under the cloud base.  Were traveling at a slow rate of speed. There was an orange hue like a distant campfire.  There was no color change just dimming and brightening.  As each one passed they followed the same direction and made a slight angular turn of about 20 degrees to the south of my location.  Each one was slightly closer as they passed over and I could see details of the third one.  It appeared as if there was an orangeish haze coming off it but not enough to leave a trail.  There was a smaller sphere inside of the large outer one and was positioned at about 7:00 area in the direction it was traveling.  The smaller one illuminated the outer one.  There was no structure to it, it looked like a giant bubble.  There was absolutely no sound.  The only odd effect was static electricity feeling in the air.  The objects grouped to gather in a diamond shape and ascended into the clouds and that was the end of the sighting.  I have an hd video that is about 6 minutes.  As the last one went overhead my phone shutdown... I do however have the majority of it recorded with some detail of the closest one.;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486

The light from it shined one me like a car headlight in the dark. I turned my head to look at Polaris and when I looked bk it was gone.;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
