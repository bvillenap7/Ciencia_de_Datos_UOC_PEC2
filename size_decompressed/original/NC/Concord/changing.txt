It started out just looking like a star, but it was to close to be one. I took my camcorder and zoom into it and it started changing shape and color. To the left of it you could see one more, but it was shaped diffent. It flew into the other one and then it just flew off. The frist one we saw just stayed there changing shapes and colors. We watch it for an hour. We called the news station and they said they could see it to. They were going to go out and see if they could find out what it was, but we have not been told anything yet. I know it was not something that is there all the time. We have not seen it before and so far it has not back. The colors were blue and then green and then a pink color. The shapes were all kind. It split into two and then went back to one. The video is so great. It was fun watching it and hopefully it will be back. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses may have been looking at a celestial body, possibly the star, Sirius, which twinkles vividly.  PD));35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
