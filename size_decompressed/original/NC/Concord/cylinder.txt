It was about an hour an a half after the all star race at the Charlotte Motor Speedway.  We were hanging out after the race waiting on traffic to die down.   Me and two other guys were sitting there listening to music when I saw what looked like an orange ball of light coming from my right from the southeast up Morehead Rd toward the North West toward turn 2 of the race track.   After I pointed up for my other two friends to see it we began to try to figure out what it was.  It looked like an upright object gray in color not shiny kind of dull.  It did not make a sound that we could hear but there was a lot of background noise from traffic turning away from it.   The ball of what looked like fire or an orange light began to dim as it got closer to the track.  We reasoned that it was not a plane or a chopper since it did not have flashing or front facing lights.   Finally the light went completely out and we still saw the solid object in the air steadily moving in the same direction.   One of my friends got spooked and demanded we leave.  I continued to watch it for a minute or two with no fire/light just moving along.;35.4081123839007;-80.5891190402486
