The craft had 2 large fans on the bottom.  I could hear the hum of what sounded like fans blowing.  The craft was a gun metal color and had flashing blue and white lights.  I stopped my vehicle I got out of the vehicle and it slowly drifted to the right of my driveway.  Intrigued I called my wife and neighbors to come to the end of the driveway where I was, at that time.  There were multiple crafts flying low with spot lights coming on periodically from the crafts shining through the trees.   Over the course of 2 hours, we witnessed 15-20 which were all different than the first craft, they seemed smaller with a triangular shape.  The triangle shaped crafts were all like backwards flying triangles all going in the same pattern toward the larger spot light.  At times we could all see these crafts zooming very fast, almost like a shooting stars, some leaving a white light trail that was white and some leaving trails that were red.  At times some would zig zag and the lights would periodically disappear and then reappear just as sudden.;35.2255;-79.7907
