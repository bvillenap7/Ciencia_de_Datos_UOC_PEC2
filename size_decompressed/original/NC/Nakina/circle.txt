Multiple sightings of single light craft zigzagging back and forth across the sky.;2017-10-03 23:00:00;1 hour+;Multiple sightings of single &quotlight craft&quot zigzagging back and forth across the sky. Over the course of the last couple of weeks my boyfriend had been telling me to come look outside.  I finally did the last time.  And it happened again tonight.  Tonight was even better.  I could actually see what he was describing last time.  So, there is this light that has been visiting our area that we cannot reason what it could be logically anything man made.  The light has been seen at least 8 times by him and twice by me.  The light craft hovers and then does zigzag formations, but never descends (as if a plane was landing).  It's always at night when we see it, and then light craft stays for a while.  Also, we have notice it happens that we see the craft after important/horrifying events for example the deadly mass shooting last night and now tonight.  I think they are watching us.;34.1122;-78.6601
