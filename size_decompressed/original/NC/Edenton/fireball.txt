There was a sunset with lots of color in the pink range, the object looked like a comet with a long tail which was split, parallel, I thought I was seeing a meteor and thought it was breaking up as 3 small objects appeared below and falling with it. I pulled over 3 times to take pictures with my phone,  I began to change my thinking this was a meteor when the 3 little objects stopped falling and from my vantage point hovered above trendline as the large object kept falling and then curved to the right, at the same time another object streaming the same colors, appeared above and seemed to be falling in the same trajectory.  I was hoping to make it to the bridge over the chowan river, hiway 17, to get a clearer view but it had disappeared, all I saw were some jet contrails which were white as the sunset colors were leaving the sky.  I have never seen anything similar to this, i was raised at china lake naval base where there was a lot of experimenting going on, aircraft and such.   We were a short distance from Edwards air force base and I have witnessed rockets breaking up in the sky from Vandenberg air force base, seen a boiloid as it was decentragating in the mt sky, and have watched a space shuttle land, so I have some experience with weird sky stuff.  Not to mention having seen the stealth bomber before it was official.  The photos on my phone aren't very good but support what I saw, haven't seen anything reported on this yet, wanted to document before I forget.  best wishes.;36.0908;-76.6224
