Three Blinking lights underneath.;2016-11-03 08:30:00;A brief minute;Three Blinking lights underneath Driving back home from school and I noticed there were 3 lights in the sky not far off the ground (About 20 or 30 feet?) I thought it must have been and airplane or helicopter (it resembled the same kind of lights you would see underneath a plane) but discarded that idea realizing it was to close off the ground and it stayed in one place, not moving!  The lights were blinking in the colors of red, blue, and green.   I slowed down looking up in passing underneath it and drove home. Turned around to go back and try to see it again but it was gone.  Weirdest thing I have EVER saw!!;35.4439;-83.2867
