A very slow moving cluster of bright, brilliant lights;2007-10-05 19:30:00;1.5 Hours;A very slow moving cluster of bright, brilliant lights My son and I were laying in our back yard looking at stars in a west northwest direction when I noticed a cluster of light that was virtually sitting still. The light was a brilliant red, white, and green.  The lights resembled spot lights on an object.  The object moved in a very slow westerly direction.  An airplane would have been out of sight in minutes whereas this object was in sight for at least 1.5 hours.  GSO (Greensboro, NC) tower is approximately 25 miles from my home and I called to see if they had anything on their scope in that general direction and the controller replied “the only aircraft I have on my scope is a VFR Cessna approaching Clemmons cruising at 2,000 feet.”, sure enough seconds later a Cessna 172 had practically flown over my house.   About the controller’s scope, he had informed me his scope had a reach of 60+ nautical miles.  The object was an unusual shape almost the shape of an animated drawing of a boxy automobile.  I used my binoculars to try and get a better look, I don’t have a telescope. The object slowly went away and finally out of sight.  I have no conclusion I can’t imagine this was some kind of GA aircraft, military aircraft or helicopter of some sort.  I’m not an astrological scientist,   but maybe this could have been something.  It was very unusual and I never have seen anything like it.  Instrument rated pvt pilot.;36.0330000000001;-80.3916000000003
