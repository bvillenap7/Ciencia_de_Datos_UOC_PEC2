It hovered on the horizon and then just diappeared.  There were also some red lights in it. It only moved slightly then just was gone.  We first noticed it when we took our dogs outside.

Round white bright object with flashing red and green lights moving slightly up and down;2015-11-14 05:50:00;15 seconds;Round white bright object with flashing red and green lights moving slightly up and down I was on my phone as I noticed a lot of light coming from my window (I had my blinds closed and I have black curtains) and yes I was still able to see a round shape so I thought it was the moon but then I thought why would it be so bright.  I looked closer after moving my curtains and blinds to the side and saw it in the sky ad figured it was a plane but it looked to close, and since there aren't really many airports that close to here I took a closer look and noticed flashing lights.  I can't really remember if it was more than green and red.  I also noticed that overall color of the object was a white light and it was moving slightly up and down not straight across like a normal plane would.

My husband and I saw a bright neon orange orb fly to the sky for about a minute.;2016-07-09 23:49:00;1.05;My husband and I saw a bright Neon orange orb fly to the sky for about a minute. My husband and I were sitting outside on our apartment front porch when I saw a bright orange light coming from behind the trees northwest of us.  As it came from behind the trees it was obvious it was not a plane, drone, or helicopter because of the size, brightness and consistency of the light source, and also how low it was and how fast it was going.  The color of the orb was bright neon orange, and it did not look like head lights, or any other lights I have ever seen before, but it had a glow to it.   I got up and started video recording it, from our point of view it flew south towards the back of our apartment building, but was further past our apartment, then started going east then back south east.  In that process, the light dimmed a little bit then they dimmed even more and within a few seconds it disappeared.  When I say the object starting going different directions, I don’t mean sharp movements, but just slowly turning in those directions.  Also, besides the other factors I mentioned before about it not being a plane I could also tell it was different because of the way it flew it was obvious that the way it was never in seen in a perfect straight course line like planes are seen doing.  My husband as well as my neighbor, the whole incident lasted about a minute to a minute and 5 seconds long.   I do have a video that is 46 seconds long but because it was a cell phone recording you cannot see the orange glow.  If I am able to send please forgive the cussing I was very excited. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the wife, who submitted the report, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect that she is a very reliable witness.

A ball of bright light went flying back my window at night.;2020-07-13 01:00:00;2 seconds;A ball of bright light went flying back my window at night. I was trying to go to sleep but couldn’t, and I was faced towards my window.  I had just closed my eyes when there was a blinding light, and when I opened them I saw a ball of light zoom last my window.  It was going incredibly fast.  I don’t really believe in aliens, thought a UFO doesn’t necessarily mean aliens, so I just lied there for a while to trying to rationalize what I saw.  But, it kept haunting me so I checked twitter to see if anyone else had seen it and tweeted about it, then I went online to see if any planes were flying in my area and the closest one was three hours away.  At that point, I decided to report it.;36.0330000000001;-80.3916000000003
