I was watching the moon when all of a sudden I saw a light appear from behind the clouds.  It moved very quickly, almost like it wuz moving with the clouds.  When it got a little closer, I could make out a large triangular shaped craft of some kind with a red glow in the center and a strong soft white glow going around it.  It moved quickly over my head and the vanished into the clouds.  This was about 5 minutes before the sun began to come up.  My friend saw it to, so i know i wasn't seeing something normal.;36.0330000000001;-80.3916000000003
