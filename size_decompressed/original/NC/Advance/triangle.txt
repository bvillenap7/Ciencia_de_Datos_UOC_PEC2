Driving down the road at 11:59, I notice a VERY bright amber colored light in the sky.  It wasn't moving at all but was MUCH brighter than any thing I'd ever seen in the sky.  We stopped and got out of the car.  It then started moving directly towards us. It didn't move directly towards us, it banked out to the right and then maneuvered over us.  As it got close, the bright amber light disappeared and all we could see was the very bright brilliant colored flashing lights on the craft.  The light looked so pure and I could see every color of the rainbow in this pure white light.  It made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  Have been very skeptical until now.  This is a life changer.;36.0059000000001;-80.4501999999996
