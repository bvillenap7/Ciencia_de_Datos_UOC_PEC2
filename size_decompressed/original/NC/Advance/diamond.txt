UFO traveling north-south flys over rural farm area slowly and silently.;2013-09-05 00:00:00;5-7 minutes;UFO traveling north-south flys over rural farm area slowly and silently. UFO sighted while driving down a back road in rural county.  It appeared to look like a large red planet but much brighter.  It appeared due north and was traveling due south at the stroke of midnight.  It appeared to sit still for 1-2 minutes and it became more dim as it got closer.   As it was passed overhead, the amber light disappeared and we started seeing what appeared to be white flashing lights.  Within the white flashing lights you could see almost every color in the spectrum.  It appeared to be triangle/diamond shaped and made absolutely no noise.  Couldn't judge the distance and felt disoriented after viewing it. It appeared to disappear in the distance but video indicates scattered flashing lights.;36.0059000000001;-80.4501999999996
