I saw the object move in an up and down motion and occasionally side to side. I tried to get video and I did capture it although it was too far away to make it out clearly.  Two airplanes flew by with red lights underneath and when they got near the area in the sky where this object was, the light dimmed and it stood completely still in the sky.  No movement at all.  Once the airplanes were out of sight, the craft began to move up and down again.  The video does not capture what I saw with my naked eye but I definitely saw it.;35.9541;-79.7592
