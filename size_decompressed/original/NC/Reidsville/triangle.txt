Triangle object over field, 30 ft from ground, also saw being from this sighting;1999-08-08 22:15:00;2 hours;Triangle object over field, 30 ft from ground, also saw being from this sighting This event occured one night while I was babysitting for my 3 yr old cousin.  About 10:10, I was on the phone with a friend and went outside onto the porch, which is 12 ft or so off the ground. In just a few minutes, I saw this triangle shaped pbject moving over the field by the house.  It was about 30 feet away from me, about eye level, due to the bank that drops about 10 ft below the driveway. It was dark in color, black?, and had orangy yellow lights that flashed in a pattern, but not sequentially.  It was moving at approximatley 5 mph, and made no sound.  I told my friend that I had to go, but would call her back when it was gone. At this point, a blue?white light came from the bottom, and that's all I remembered at the time. 2 hours are unaccounted for, but I have remembered a few things.  One is an odd black box, and I was shown what was inside but am not allowed to remember what it was at this time.  The being that I saw that night is the same one I have been seeing since childhood, and even though he has told me his name, I can't say it or spell it.  I also reported this incident to MUFON at the time it occurred, but never got a reply.  This is not the only experience I have had, but it was the most awsome. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
