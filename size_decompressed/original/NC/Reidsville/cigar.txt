Reidsville Prom Sighting;2001-04-20 01:30:00;20 minutes;Reidsville Prom Sighting It was the night of the local high school's prom.  As we were driving home from the prom breakfast, we encountered a silver cigar shaped object with blinking red and white lights, whizzing back and forth with great speed.  Were were driving in two cars, and we pulled over to watch the object. As we pulled over and got out, the object slowed down and lowered toward us.  It hovered over us, remarkable making no noise, and shined a spotlight in our face.  We were so scared we were in a trance.  We could not move.  It seemed like we stood there for hours, but when it left, it had only been three minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies self as adult.  PD));36.3402;-79.6622000000002
