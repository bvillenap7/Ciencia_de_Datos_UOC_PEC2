I asked my dad did you see that?  Next thing you know we see the light kind of looked like the size and distance of the International space station.  We watch it surge in speed and sometimes slow to a stall.  It would blink on at very random times. From 2 seconds to 10 seconds before another flash.  It was north towards lake reidsville in NC.  To me it looked like a UFO losing power and getting surges of power to light up and move faster.  Then when my wife came out after 5 minutes it started to slow and fade with every flash.  Then it disappeared.  It did not travel far across the sky in a north east direction.  3 of us saw it and know it was not a plane due to the distance and varying speed, light brightness and timing of the flash.  Something was losing power or down.  Pretty amazing sight;36.3402;-79.6622000000002
