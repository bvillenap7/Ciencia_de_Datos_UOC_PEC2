i was trying to sleep and....;1999-12-01 23:00:00;about ten minutes;i was trying to sleep and.... it was about 11 o clock and i was trying to sleep in my new batman pj's. i suddenly had the urge to look out my window. i looked out and over the tree line i saw a disk shaped object hovering over the trees. i thought it was a plane at first but i noticed it wasn't moving at all. it had many different blinking lights around the outter edge of the saucer. then it vanisihed.
