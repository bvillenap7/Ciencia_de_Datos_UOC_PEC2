Silver oval w/rotating lights;1982-07-15 21:00:00;5 minutes;Silver oval w/rotating lights I was visiting my father for the summer when on one evening just after the sun set I was playing outside by myself when this craft came from behind the trees and slowy hovered just above tree top level. It ran dowwn the length of the yard ( About 100 yds.) and out over the feild with me running right under it. It made no sounds but it seemed to create a lite breeze it the trees and field grass. It had lights going all the way around it and had a metalic apperance. This happpened when I was 10 or 11 and I have never since seen anything strange in the sky but this I know was not of anything I can explain to this day.(note: Out in the booneys, Nearest neihbor > 1 mile away. Never any aircraft in area.) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.3402;-79.6622000000002
