Silver mettalic craft shadowing large jet with no visible exhaust;2012-03-27 09:55:00;1 minute +/-;Silver mettalic craft shadowing large jet with no visible exhaust While sitting on my porch, which faces west, at approximately 0955 on Tuesday, March 27th 2012, I noticed a silver metallic object shadowing a passenger jet approximately 200-400 feet beneath it.  It was about 1/2 the size of the plane the plane had the usual white contrail but this object had absolutely NO contrail what so ever. There were 4-5 jets visible in the area (which is common) with 2 on a similar glide path it caught my eye as I said, due to its proximity to the jet.   We are roughly an hour north west of the Charlotte airport, which explains the number of aircraft in the area. The plane was flying from my right (north) to the left (South West) on a rough heading of approximately 250* degrees.
