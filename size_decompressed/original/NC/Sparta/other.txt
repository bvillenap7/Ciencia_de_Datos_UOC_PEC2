On September 20, 2020, my wife and I were watching the sunset on the Blue Ridge Parkway at mile marker 242 outside of Sparta, NC.  Right after the sun had set below the mountains we noticed a bright, silver looking object in the sky over the mountains far off in the distance and it was long and thin from where we were sitting. It traveled across the entire horizon in a matter of minutes and then we noticed 4 more of these objects appear out of nowhere and proceed in different directions.  We only got photos of the first object but decided to return the next evening for the sunset and see if we saw them again. On September 21, 2020 (from the exact same location) I videoed another object that must have been the size of a city traveling from North to South in a matter of minutes it covered the entire horizon, which after doing the math, meant the object was traveling at approximately 72000 MPH.  That is the same speed the earth travels around the sun.;36.5143;-81.1376
