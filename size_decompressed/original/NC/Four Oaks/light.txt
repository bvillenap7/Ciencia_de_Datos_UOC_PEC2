I was heading to work on Saturday December 4, 2010 when i noticed a small light in the sky.  It was traveling at a slow speed, to slow for an airplane (did not have any blinking lights what so ever.   My mother and father came out to say their goodbyes and looked up and noticed it as well.  The light was over the top of us and seem to stall for a period of 2 - 3 minutes my mother said that is odd.  I said yeah and it is not moving or making any noise either.   I reached for an old rifle scope in my truck and tried to get a clear image of the object but it started moving towards the north, north west, as it passed over no sound just a small bright light no signs of wings landing gear exhaust or anything that looked like our air craft.  This thing started to move so i got in my vehicle and followed pursuit it seemed as it started gaining speed and altitude and faded into the horizon.   I do not know what this was but it made no noise it was absolutely silent, no roars from afterburners, no nothing only light.   The color of the light was like that of a torch orange with a white brightness about it keep in mind this thing stopped over the house for a few minutes so who ever reads this good luck figuring this one out....;35.4034;-78.4182999999999
