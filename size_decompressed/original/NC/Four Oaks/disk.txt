I realized that what I was seeing was in the northern sky. I looke east and saw the moon. I came in the house and got the binoculars and looked out of the kitchen window. What I was was extremely large. It was a gold-silver color. It was saucer shaped with a definite dome on the top. It was hovering in the sky. It had flashing lights at the top,bottom and on the left side. I went outside to get a better look. after looking through the binoculars for a few seconds, I ran back inside and got a video camera and telephone to call for others to come out and see the object. I was able to get the object on videotape. After a few minutes of watching the object, it began to move very slowly to the east where it went behind some trees and out of sight. I would say that the object was at least five miles from where we were located.;35.4034;-78.4182999999999
