rectangle shaped, low flying object over Oakridge, NC;2007-07-10 00:00:00;twice, both times were ab;rectangle shaped, low flying object over Oakridge, NC It was around 12:00 AM, maybe a little earlier, when I first saw the object fly by. I was laying in bed, looking out my window, and I saw this thing fly directly over the house. It was in the shape of a rectangle, the bottom of the craft was flat, and it had lights in row down each side. It was flying extremely low. It was only a couple inches above the top of the trees in my back yard. It made some noise, but it wasn't loud at all. 	What was so peculiar about this sighting was how low it was flying, a jet flying that low would've made a lot of noise, and the direction in which it was flying. I pay attention to the direction of air traffic near my house and I've never seen a plane fly in that direction, that low, before. They usually are over to the left and they travel  east. This object flew directly over my house, traveling north. I saw it disappear north..I thought it was weird but it was out of sight so I decided to just forget about it. 	About fifteen minutes passed by and I saw it again! I don't know if it was the same one or a different one. This time it was traveling from east to west. I got a better look at it this time. It was definitely a rectangle shaped thing, traveling very low, making hardly any noise at all..definitely not an airplane. That was the last I saw of it.;36.1652;-79.9778
