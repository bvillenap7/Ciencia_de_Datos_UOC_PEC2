Star-like Object witnessed above FL600 at a high rate of speed traveling SSE to NNW;2010-10-28 19:37:00;7 mins;Star-like Object witnessed above FL600 at a high rate of speed traveling SSE to NNW While looking towards the NNE sky towards the little dipper, I noticed what looked like a star that was moving. Adjusting just slightly off of the object, due to any auto-kenisis that could affect my vision, I was correct that there was movement. The velocity of the object was extremely fast.  The altitude I would say was well above FL600. There is common carrier air traffic to the south of my location with a commonly used airway.  Those aircraft are all well below 45000' and that airway travels an easterly/westerly direction. The object displayed no strobe lighting systems, nor anti-collision lighting systems. No sounds were observed from the object. I returned inside after witnessing the object to note a time of 1945hrs local time or 0045Z. I also checked NASA's Skywatch for any satellites passing in the region that were visible around the time of my sighting.  All that were listed stated satellites approached from the northern sky sector and departed southerly.  The witnessed object traveled from SSE traveling NNW. I am a certified commercial pilot with over 20yrs of aviation experience and this object was not an airplane.  I am quite confused as to what I saw.
