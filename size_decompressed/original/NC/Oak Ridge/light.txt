I Much brighter than any other object in the sky. We are two well educated adults with no history of hallucinations and/or obsessions with objects in the sky that can't be explained.  We both witnessed a very bright light at about a 70 degree angle from the ground dance around in the same general vicinity for about an hour.  This object was much bighter than the planet Mars and any other object in the sky.  It appeared to be closer to earth than any other light in the sky.  We watched it as it seemed to skip around, sometimes moving up and down, sometimes moving sideways, and it even moved in a circular path.  Please someone tell me that you know what this is and saw it too. ((NUFORC Note:  Ordinarily, we would suspect that the witnesses might have been looking at a twinkling star, but there are no twinkling stars that are brighter than Mars is, currently.  We do not know what the witnesses might have observed, but genuine UFO's generally do not remain visible for an hour.  PD));36.1652;-79.9778
