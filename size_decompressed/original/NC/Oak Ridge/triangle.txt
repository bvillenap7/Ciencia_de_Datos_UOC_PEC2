I thought maybe a transformer had blown so I went in and woke my father up. we went around to the front of the house and it seemed louder,and when we looked up, there it was just sitting there, a big black triangle right above the trees. I started to shoot at it but Pa said it could be miltary then it took off straight up and out of sight about 5 min later three military helicopters came over our house so low i could see the people inside. evey scince that night we have had helicopters flying around our house real low real late at night. A good buddy of mine said he saw somthing like what I saw too and i didnt even tell him about my experience. And as far as the military choppers they're all the talk of this quiet little town one landed in a field off highway 68 the other day we saw soldiers with M-16s jump out and run into the woods. Im a little scared to be typing this im not going to tell my name only that Somthing is going on out here in Oakridge N.C.;36.1652;-79.9778
