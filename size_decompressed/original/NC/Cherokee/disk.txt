This silver disc shaped object was spotted hovering back and forth in and above the tree line above the creek everyone tubed on.;1979-06-30 13:00:00;2 minutes;Camping at Cherokee campground Great Smokey Mountains in North Carolina, mid to late 1970's, around the middle of the day, this silver disc shaped object was spotted hovering back and forth in and above the tree line above the creek everyone tubed on.   Several campers came running out and saw it come over the tree line right down into the middle of the campground, it hovered for about 30 sec's and then shot off straight up and opposite direction it had entered extremely fast.  It was a silver disc shaped object with red and green flashing lights pulsating all around.   My brother and I were really young maybe around 8 years old or so at the time and we thought it was the space ship from the amusement park in Pigeon Forge.  It was back when there was nothing in Pigeon Forge, but the little amusement park on right heading in to Gatlinburg, some ice cream shop, and few other places.   This UFO was witnessed by my dad, brother, myself, and several campers in the campground.   I've searched for anyone reporting the same thing around the same time at this campground.   The campground is now a water treatment plant in Cherokee, North Carolina. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
