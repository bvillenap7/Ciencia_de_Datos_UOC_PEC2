Unknown white orb followed by approxmately 4 known objects;1978-10-15 20:00:00;2 min.;Unknown white orb followed by approxmately 4 known objects I am not sure of the date or the time, I was at my sisters house sitting near a picture window watching tv.  I happen to look outside and saw a large white light travelling to the southeast.  I yelled for my sister and her husband, we went outside to get a better look.  Seeing the light was astonishing, but we were concentrating on the light so much that we did not see at first the most astonishing part of the whole episode, behind the light ( it was hard to distinguish how far behind the light they were) was approxmitely 4 jets following the light.  We watched for around 2 min. until they disappeared.  I followed the newspapers, radio and tv for the next week, but could find anything mentioning what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
