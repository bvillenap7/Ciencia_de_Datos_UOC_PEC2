Cigar-shaped craft, traveling over road in country, 200-300 ft. in the air.  200-300 mph, no wings, no markings, no sound. Silver.;1998-05-12 16:00:00;few seconds;Cigar-shaped craft, traveling over road in country, 200-300 ft. in the air.  200-300 mph, no wings, no markings, no sound. Silver. I was returning home from a visit with my mother in Jacksonville, North Carolina.  It was approximately 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon (clear/sunny).  I was traveling North on Rt. 258, headed to Kinston, N.C. from Richlands, N.C. I was a few miles outside Richlands in the country.  The road was two lanes asphalt.  I was driving at about 55 mph,looking straight ahead down the road.  Both sides of the roadway was lined with large tree's.  Every now and then I would pass a house, farm, or open field, but ahead of me there were just tree's.  Suddenly, I observed a cigar-shaped object pass over the road ahead, from my right to the left.  It was flying level, approximately several hundred feet above the roadway.  It wa silver-colored, no markings, no wings, no cockpit or windows, and no exhaust.  On the read top third of the craft, it had what at first appeared to be a 30 degree angled verticle tailfin.  As I looked at the tailfin, it appeared to be, not a funtional tailfin (no visible rudder), but instead a part of the craft.  I couldn't see any shadow to indicate the vertical fin was narrower than the cigar-shaped craft.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen.  I have seen virtually every type of manned and unmanned aircraft, rocket, and futuristic type craft in or under development (both military and civilian).  I simply could not explain what I was seeing.  I heard no sounds.  I sped up my vehicle to see if I might come to a field on the left side of the roadway, so I might get a look at the craft going away from me.  I did not find any field ahead on the left side of the road.  This sighting was very disturbing to me.  I want to know what is going on???  Does the military have secret craft under development that defy gravity??? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));35.2255189189189;-77.6370648648649
