Very loud, but not like a normal air craft you usually see.  It didn't shake the house or the ground like normal military crafts do when they fly over.  No exhaust.  Color: Black. Lights on bottom of craft 4 green lights circle shaped.  The lights where not blinding. The shape of this air craft is very difficult too explain because it had multiple different shapes involved as the design. It looked like something out of a sci-fi movie.  It was a about 30 to 40 feet long and 8-12 feet wide.  the fying manuevers of this aircraft is very unusual and remarkable.  It was able to fly below tree lines at a very slow speed roughly 3 mph, hovering capabilities,and raise itself over the trees. As it flew the back side of the house you can see and hear it.  I saw this flashing strobe light through the trees traveling.  I see it turn and slow down and raised over the trees as I looked back because I lost visual of the object for split second, it raises up to get visual and turns around and starts coming and speeding up and in a dog fight formation like its going too take me out, decreasing elevation and slows down and hovers over us like its survalencing us at very low elevation but below my tree heights because it had to raise itself in elevation to get over the other tree line.  Very unusual air craft. Really neat show in a way and breath taking but I felt very invaded. Im sure lots of ther people in the area heard it.  You couldn't miss it.  The stranges thing was it was over a residential neighborhood.  I didn't take any photos because I couldn't get my camera working properly in time. Mulitple people saw and heard this air craft in the area.;35.1949;-83.818
