Fireball in North Carolina Mountains.;2011-01-08 23:45:00;2 sec.;Fireball in North Carolina Mountains. I was at work and had decided to have a cigarette outside. I usually stare up into the night sky to look at the moon and clouds pass by as I smoke my cigarette and this night was exceptionally clear. As I was looking at the stars, a bright orange fireball appeared out of nowhere and was traveling from west to east.  The fireball seemed to only be illuminated for approximately two to three seconds before it flared out. It was bright orange in color and seemed to be fairly close to the ground.  Being that it was only visible for only a couple of seconds, it was hard to gauge size and distance however, I would have to approximate that it was larger than a basketball and around 1000 yards up.;35.0668;-83.218
