Strange lights over Queen Mountain;2002-11-09 23:30:00;30 seconds;Strange lights over Queen Mountain My husband and I had just gone to bed.  We saw a flashing light that we thought was lightning but the flashes were very fast and bright.  We got out of bed and looked out the window.  We saw over the adjacent Mountain ( Queen Mountain)  there was a light flashing.  It was lighting up the entire sky and the valley.  The light was flashing white then red.  At first we thought maybe a car had hit a power line because after we saw the flashes the power went off.  But we went down the road where the lights had been flashing and we found nothing out of the ordinary.  Our neighbors had power.  We still don't know what could have caused the lights.  We don't live in the city, we live on the outskirts of a small town.  Farming areas.  We have never seen anything like these lights ever.  I have lived here my entire life and this is a first for me.  Please can you give me an answer.;35.0668;-83.218
