Six deep orange lights in night sky and three of them in triangle formation.;2015-05-16 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Six deep orange lights in night sky and three of them in triangle formation. First of all, I am not the type of person who looks for UFOs and have never been particularly interested in the topic, but what my husband and I saw last Saturday night was so extraordinary I felt the need to report it.   We were in our backyard between 10:00 and 10:30 pm and my husband had walked out to the middle of the yard to throw the ball for our dog.  He looked up and told me to come look at something.  It was a round, very vivid deep orange circle of light moving across the sky at a fairly slow and steady pace.  It was very low and so close that it appeared to be right above our neighbor’s roof.   Another one came behind the first one and as we were watching these I saw several more coming through the trees in the back of our yard.  When they cleared the trees we could see that it was three in a perfect triangle formation.  These three stayed the exact same distance from each other the whole time.  One more followed after that.  They were coming from the southwest and moving northeast, and were completely silent.    We watched each one as they passed over our neighborhood and then seemed to “disappear.”  We could see the flashing navigation lights of planes much higher above and I do know that these were not planes.    Unfortunately, we were so mesmerized and in disbelief at what we were seeing that we didn’t run inside for our phones to document it.  It is so difficult to comprehend the fact that we actually saw what we saw and at this time I have no explanation for it but would truly love one.  I don’t know what it was that we saw but I have never seen anything like it in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
