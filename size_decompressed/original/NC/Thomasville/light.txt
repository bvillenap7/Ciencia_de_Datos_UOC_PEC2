Initially, I believed it to just be a star, or when I noticed it moving, a shooting star.  However, the pattern which it follow was very odd as it was basically curving back and forth, essentially an S or Wave shaped flight path that would, to my knowledge, be impossible for any current manned flight or air traffic common to my area as the back and forth pattern was too tight to be a plane.   It traveled across the sky for roughly a minute before fading out, starting near the northern most star in the big dipper (as per the sky in my area) following a roughly south, to south south west pattern.;35.8726;-80.0929000000006
