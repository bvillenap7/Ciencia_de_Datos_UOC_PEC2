Bright shinning cirular craft hovering over Business 85 N.;2016-06-09 20:50:00;5 minutes;Bright shinning cirular craft hovering over Business 85 N. Traveling right to left (NE) on a crystal clear blue sky evening at 8:30 pm, a circular light the size of a house jitterbugged across the sky in front of my car - 1000 ft OUT and 5-7000 ft UP, as I traveled with my family.  It stayed very illuminated for 2 minutes then VANISHED in a split second.  It appeared again 10 miles up the interstate 3000 ft out and 10,000 ft UP.  We pulled over and watched it for 4 minutes over the Grandover Hotel, then it vanished again.  When it vanished- it didn't speed away in a direction - it just disappeared from the clear blue sky right in front of us.   It shook me up!  I do not believe in alien space craft, but my wife is in the airline business and we know an aircraft when we see it (especially that close), so I am at a loss for what this could be.  I am fascinated how many people were traveling up that interstate and had to see this bright massive light over the interstate - and failed to post it anywhere on the net.;35.8726;-80.0929000000006
