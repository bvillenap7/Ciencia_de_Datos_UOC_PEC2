Object is composed of three, solid, bright, white lights in a straight line and was silent. The craft moved slow and low for approximately five minutes.  The object would turn, thus aligning the lights to appear as one larger light. It was traveling South-East at approx. 1,000 feet or less and cruising slowly. It flew in this direction for several minutes before turning and back to the North and disappearing behind the tree line.  This craft was first seen by me as a friend pulled into my driveway.  My friend, Editor and Chief of the local paper and his wife also witnessed the sighting.  The sky is crystal clear.  Planes are flying all around & this object is clearly NOT a plane or chopper!;35.7962;-81.4274
