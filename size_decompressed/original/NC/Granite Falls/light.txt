Small fiery orb zips erratically in the northern sky.;2017-09-25 22:15:00;10-12 minutes;Small fiery orb zips erratically in the northern sky. While waiting on a friend to leave, I was watching the northern sky, as we had been star gazing all evening. I was alone, focusing on a star, when a single, small, orange light began to move horizontally. With the movement, I could tell that the light was somewhat close and thought it may be a reflection on a spider's web.  This was until the light started moving up and down, left and right, very erratically, but not all over the sky.  It stayed within a small area in the sky.  I then thought it may be a drone. I watched it intently, by myself, for about 10 mins., move around.  It never blinked or flickered once.  The orange-ish light looked similar to fire, not electrical or gassy.  It almost had a little haze around the orb.  The size was small, comparable to the size of a large star. My friend then comes out to leave, I tell her to watch, and she sees it, too.  It lasted a couple of more minutes until vanishing.  It just dissipated, like the fire had gone out. I did feel an overwhelming sense, it brought me to tears, and I was covered in chills. I've been a star gazer my entire life, even seeing two shooting stars earlier that night.   Never have I seen or experienced anything like this.;35.7962;-81.4274
