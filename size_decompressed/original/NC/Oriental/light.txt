Odd lights over the Pamlico Sound.;2020-01-03 04:30:00;10 minutes;Odd lights over the Pamlico Sound. Saw an odd white light  in the sky over the Pamlico Sound in eastern North Carolina.  I was running a tugboat on the Neuse River Inter Coastal Waterway.  I saw a white light in the sky over the water.  I didnâ€™t really think anything about until a smaller white light came from it at a high rate of speed and disappeared.  I brought the light to the attention of another crew member and we watched it for about 10 minutes before it just disappeared.  The light stemmed to pulsate getting dim then bright.  For a few seconds it turned green.  The objective was stationary the entire time.;35.0352;-76.7016
