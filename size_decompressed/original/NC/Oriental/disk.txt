The three approached the screen porch of home where I was sitting. Figures were almost transparent and had a orange cast that seemed to grow lighter and darker – almost as if they were talking with signals.  They came right up to the screen and watched me for more than a minute. At the time I sensed that the entire area was enclosed in some sort of force field – almost as if I were in a black hole where nothing could escape or enter if not already inside. It was the oddest sensation I've ever experienced.;35.0352;-76.7016
