I noticed a group of 4 red lights hovering over a local fast food outlet.;2015-12-21 22:15:00;2 minutes;My husband and I were on our way top pick our daughter up from work at Wendy's.  While driving under the bridge, I noticed a group of 4 red lights hovering over Bojangles.  They weren't moving or  blinking like those on the tower to the right.   I immediately told my husband to look and soon after the started to form a angle and go up.  I instructed my husband to hurry and park the car so I could get a picture, all while watching them out the window.   They started to go upward until they disappeared but a few seconds later I saw one single light go straight up into the air and dissappear.  My husband seemed to think they were airplanes but I quickly informed him that planes can't fly that close without crashing into each other.   I do believe what I saw was not of this world.;35.6903000000001;-80.8888000000001
