Diamond shaped UFO with red lights;2015-12-12 22:00:00;10 minutes;Diamond shaped UFO with red lights I was out with my friend in this neighborhood on the lake stargazing.  There is a bridge (high up, stretches over the lake) that we were on where you can see almost everything. My friend points at the sky at these hovering bright red lights. There was no flashing that we could see at this point.  It moved one way, then it would stop, then slowly keep moving. It gets closer and we continue to watch it.  There ended up being 4 lights, in a diamond shape.  One of these lights inconsistently blinked white.  The object continued to move across the sky in across very odd way, speeding up and slowing down, moving around sporadically, and definitely not traveling in a direct flight path like an airplane would. It was not a helicopter.  It was not a drone.  It was not at at very high altitude and there was absolutely NO sound.  We continued to watch it fly and then suddenly rapidly (EXTREMELY fast) fly down and our view was obstructed by a house.  We got in the car and drove towards where we last saw it, but it was no where to be seen.;35.6903000000001;-80.8888000000001
