And disappeared into the clouds. Driving down the road, when a cigar shaped ufo passed overhead to my left. Low, and was in the clouds. I saw it pass going about 400 mph. It was only around 450 yards away. And only 125 yards off the ground. The lights looked like no plane. And the shape didnâ€™t look like a plane. After the 4-5 seconds that I saw it, it disappeared into the clouds. No light ever came out of the clouds, even after a reasonable time.;35.6903000000001;-80.8888000000001
