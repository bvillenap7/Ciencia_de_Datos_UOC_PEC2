Driving west after picking  children up from school I see a white egg shaped object in the sky .  Iâ€™m driving and slow down to almost a stop.  I think maybe a bird or plane . It flies north then stops then north again then west then disappears.  I thought maybe sun was hitting a plane wrong but  it was egg shaped and not a ballon .  It was flying then stops for a few seconds then flies then disappears . I did not alarm my kids .  It was close to Shearon Harris Nuclear power plant maybe 10 miles of so away .  Just disappeared , I once I got home I looked again toward  the north and west , really  all over the sky   but never saw anything else .;35.6273517241379;-78.8457655172411
