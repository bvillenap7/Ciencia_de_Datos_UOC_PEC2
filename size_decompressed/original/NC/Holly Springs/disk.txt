I saw in my left view as I was making the turn a round object hovering low and flying at a low speed.  The object stopped in mud air and suddenly its entire button was lit up with bright light.  This happened while I was making the right turn. I do not know how many people saw it, but I assume it was seen by others as well as the area was relatively busy. I could not hear any noises from inside my car as all my can windows were up.  This was the first time in my whole life that I observed something like that. If our military has a technology like that, it would be really neat.  However, I doubt it that the object was man made, since it was flying with no lights on at night and suddunly stopped and put its bright lights on from the bottom of the object.  I could see any Colorado as it was dark.  Its lights were very white bright ! and all of them came out at once in a matter if a second.;35.6273517241379;-78.8457655172411
