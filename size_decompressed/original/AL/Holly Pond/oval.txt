It looked like a shiny egg lying on its side. Driving home from school, approximately a mile and a half from my home, I looked up at the sky and saw what I thought at first was a plane.  What got my attention was the fact that it was very shiny, like aluminum foil, and the sun glaring on it made it shine that much more.  I then realized that it was not like any plane that I had ever seen before.  It was more of an egg shape with the egg lying on its side.  As I was trying to see it better, it moved up and away from me.  The thing moved out of site within 3 - 4 seconds and was completely gone.  I tried to see it again, but didn't have any luck.  Any clues about what this might be???  I would love to know.;34.1899;-86.6185
