A red fireball object, kind of dancing, maybe a drone, slowly came toward us at about 75 feet above our heads, hovered over us for about a minute and then slowly went out site behind trees.  We then saw a large plane flying much higher seconds later.  As we left the church separately, I drove alone to try and find it for 5 minutes.  I pulled into a parking lot on Old Birminhame Hwy of an abandoned store, 6 blocks from the church.  I spotted it up on the mountain above trees just up behind the area of the church, but the light was white, and no red.  It hovered moving slowly. No houses there.  I saw it head West toward the direction of Lincoln.  I drove West on the Old Birmingham Hwy.  It was beside me on the left in the sky, keeping pace with my car at about 30mph.  I was on the phone talking to another church member about it.  I lost sight of it when I came around a curve. Coming out of the curve, I spotted it again, on the right side of me, but it was way ahead, a couple miles down the road at the Lincoln area already in seconds, then it disappeared.  I wondered if it was a Homeland Defense drone or something.  No other reports had been made about it to the Sheriff.   Very strange.  Most bizarre thing I've seen in my 60 years.  #ScratchingMyHead;33.6662309352517;-85.809338848921
