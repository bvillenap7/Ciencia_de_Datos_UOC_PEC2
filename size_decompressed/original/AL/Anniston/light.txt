i did manage to get a picture of the cresent light on my camera phone...;2007-05-10 21:00:00;about 2 hours;thursday may 10 2007 approx 8:30 pm i opened my front door which faces the western sky i saw clearly a round light that changed colors from bright white to blue to orange, green, red and yellow, from dim to bright, it never moved in the approx 2 hours we watched it. I had called my family outside to see if they had an explaination and they too were stumped...i said wheres the moon? i looked throught a big maple tree and thought that bright white light coming trough the tree was the moon...when i walked around the tree to get a better look, it was not the moon at all, but an extremely bright light in the shape of a cresent, i never did see the moon at all that night, though it was clear night. neither object moved, the round one just changed colors and the cresent one just got narrow and wide again, by midnight when i checked back, they were gone... i did manage to get a picture of the cresent light on my camera phone...the other light just didnt show up on my phone,,,i guess it wasnt bright enough.

Two seperate sightings by two individuals of same fast moving green lights within days of each other  ((anonymous report));2017-11-09 15:00:00;2 seconds;Two seperate sightings by two individuals of same fast moving green lights within days of each other This post contains two seperate sightings: one made by me and one by my girlfriend.  Both happened while we were travelling in a vehicle.  Only one of us spotted the UFO each time. 11/09/17 around 15:00.  My girlfriend and I were riding home in the car.  I regularly scan the sky for aircraft as we live near a military base as well as a DHS compound.  I have no military background but can easily spot the difference between a helicopter and a plane, of which we see and hear several every day.  I looked into the sky and saw two green lights side by side, as if they were the exhaust from an engine on a single craft.  It appeared as if it was not moving, or moving slowly, when I initally noticed it, however I pointed at it and told my girlfriend in the passenger seat to look and before she could raise her head it flew straight across the sky in half a second, leaving no trail or evidence it was ever there.  There was no noise.  This was my first UFO sighting, however I have always been a firm believer despite this being my first sighting.  Today, 11/13/17 at around 19:00, we were also on the road and she was gazing at the stars while I was driving. She said she saw a green circular light in the sky that appeared to be moving very fast. She turned her head around to make sure it was not a green light coming from the inside of the car, which there is not a green light in my car, and when she looked back out the window it was gone. I did not witness this, she just informed me right after she saw it. This happened within two seconds as well. This is not a joke.  These two things happening to us individually within just days of each other prompted me to Google “green light ufo” and I found this website.  I felt compelled to report what we saw.
