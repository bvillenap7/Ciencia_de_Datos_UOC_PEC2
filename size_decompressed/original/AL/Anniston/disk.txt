Mcclellan, Alabama July 1977 Solid overcast day. Objects glowed and details of construction could not be seen other than the fact they appeared to be saucer shaped and at a low altitude due to cloud cover. I watched them for approx. 5 seconds until they flew out of sight over the trees. I saw them very clearly, most amazing thing I've ever seen. I don't know who else saw it because I didn't ask.  .;33.6662309352517;-85.809338848921
