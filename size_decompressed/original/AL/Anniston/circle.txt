My grandmother said oh it's just a weather ballon but it wasn't this was bright and after about 15 mins in a instant it either shrink to nothing or went south till it was out of site.  After the Wellborn vs Saks game we got home and it was on 3340 news that several sightings of ufo was reported in this area.  Now I'm of christian faith and don't believe in green Martians but all I know is I seen a  unidentified flying object, could have been pocket of space gas or something from the heavens for all I know.    A 2nd sighting acurred in same county in Coldwater, Al., Approx 1987 was traveling hwy 202 west almost at c & s service station I looked to the right and seen a round moon shaped white object in the sky I then thought to myself nice full moon tonight then it dawned on me the moon is on the opposite side after a last look at the object I lost it in the tree tops as I was driving never to see it again.

It was circular and was in a cylindrical tube of blue light.;2008-08-27 01:26:00;5 seconds;Honestly, I have never believed in the possibility of UFOâ€™s.  That was until tonight.  What I saw is the craziest thing I have ever seen in my life.  I was standing behind my apartment and clearly saw something.  It was circular and was in a cylindrical tube of blue light.  The circular portion was yellow and very bright.  At first I thought it was a shooting star.  The only reason I believe otherwise is because whatever this was slowed down and then disappeared into some clouds.  I feel crazy writing this, but maybe there is some truth to sightings.;33.6662309352517;-85.809338848921
On the west side of Anniston, Al. As soon as I walked out I noticed a very bright light in the N.  ((Venus?));2020-04-25 10:30:00;90 min;My friends and I were standing outside on the west side of Anniston, Al.  As soon as I walked out I noticed a very bright light in the NW part of the sky.  Couldn't be Venus.  I've been looking at these stars for 38 years, from the time it's warm enough to sit outside until it it's too cold.  So, it's fair to say, I can quickly spot what's not supposed to be there.  The light would dim and completely disappear.  Then, it would brighten back up.  I timed the intervals, they were odd..  This lasted for over an hour , until it disappeared Ava never appeared again.  This is the third time I've witnessed something as such.;33.6662309352517;-85.809338848921

It grew larger as it came closer and stopped at a certain point, made a few figure eight zig zag and then disappeared.  About an hour afterward, a smaller one appeared from the same direction and it didn't follow the same path as the UAP before it.  It came a little further towards where we were and before it disappeared it seemed to come down as to say it got larger as it look like it was coming towards us in a downward motion of horizontal motion, and then vertically took off.  The object left no light or tails behind it or anything to make us believe that it may have been a comic there were no flashing light to indicate that it may have been a military aircraft for a plane or a helicopter, Etc . And the colors of was red for both objects but it changed from way to White and then it had maybe kind of a bluish tint to it and then went back to read before going wherever ! we went.;33.6662309352517;-85.809338848921
