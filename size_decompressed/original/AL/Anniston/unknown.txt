UFO Spotted Over Atlanta;2009-06-23 03:15:00;almost 2 hours;UFO Spotted Over Atlanta I went outside at around 3:15 am central to smoke the nights last cigarette and noticed a light in the skies to the east. It isnt unusual to see that kind of thing, in fact I've seen hundred of airplanes taking off from Atlanta's airport. This however was not an airplane. This light started doing unusual things. At first it was rising slowly in the sky, then it started going back down. Then it went back up, and after that I sat outside and watched this bright light fade from bright to dim and back, sometimes disappearing altogether, only to reappear in another place all within what seemed to be airspace around Atlanta for almost 2 hours. This light made zig-zag patterns in the sky. It went really high up, then came back down several times. It truly did things in the air that no modern plane could do, like jumping what seemed like great distances in split seconds and hovered in place on several occasions as well. The light also seemed to pulse when it was at its brightest. I caught some of it on my phone, and used a neighbors light in the background to compare by. I've never seen anything like this before in my life. I even sent an alert to CNN!;33.6662309352517;-85.809338848921
