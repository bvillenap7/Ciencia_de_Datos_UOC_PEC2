Large and small objects change shapes and colors over New Hope,  Alabama.;2013-01-21 16:50:00;10 minutes;Large and small objects change shapes and colors over New Hope,  Alabama On 1/21/13 around 4:50 pm I was traveling down Hobbs Island road towards New Hope. I saw a light in the sky towards the east.  It was blinking, changing colors, and appeared to be continually changing its size and shape.  As I approached 431, I was within 100 to 150 yards of the object for a brief time.  I was a little nervous and crossed over 431 and headed towards 72.  I saw another unusual light about five miles down the road.  The object appeared quickly over my left shoulder.  I noticed a red light illuminating the field beside me.  This object was much smaller in size. It appeared to vibrate while changing from red to blue very fast.  I was afraid and kept driving down the road.;34.5501;-86.4001
