I had carried the trash out and notice a bright light at the horizon. Being fascinated by all things in space I just stood there and watched. I lived by myself then and had no camera. I was so fascinated I might not have thought of it anyway. I had a very rare opportunity to watch this craft move very slow and was moving due west. I would guess it was moving less than 20mph I am not sure the duration of time elapsed  But as it moved closer I knew this was not a normal thing. It passed over my next door neighbors house and even cast enough light to see shadows. It move so slow that I was able to really get a great look. To my eyes it would be as long as a pencil help at arms length. And as reported by others it made no sound. I remember thinking there is no sound.  I told all of my friends and family. Drew everyone a picture and talked about it for months. About 3 years ago a friend call me to tell me he had seen exactly what I drew on TV. Wishing I had seen it to, life went on. Tonight on the Discovery channel I saw the show about sightings and so the video shot by another sighting. The craft in the video is what I saw. I could not ever describe it better. The really strange part was it flew backwards,  flying with a flat side first. I had not ever seen this footage until tonight. The cold chills that I had that night have returned.;34.5501;-86.4001
