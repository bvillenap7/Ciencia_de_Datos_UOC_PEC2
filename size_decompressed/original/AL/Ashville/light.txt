While traveling southbound on I-59 near Ashville, Alabama, an odd light, which strobed at random, intermittent, intervals, was identified.   It moved through the sky at a varied pace, much like a helicopter could do, however the light was slowly brightened and dimmed unlike a conventional aircraft, which flashes or blinks at timed intervals.   Elevation seemed to high to be a drone and the light was too bright.;33.8374;-86.2552
