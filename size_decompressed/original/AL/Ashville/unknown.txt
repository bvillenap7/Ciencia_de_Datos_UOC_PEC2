Srange lights/unknown craft observed in E/ESE sky of NorthEastern St.Clair Co. on night of 12/05/2008. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2008-12-05 21:40:00;still ongoing @ 22:24;Srange lights/unknown craft observed in E/ESE sky of NorthEastern St.Clair County Al. on night of 12/05/2008. Observed very strangely lit object approximately 40*-50* azimuth in E/ESE sky, moving in very unconventional flight manner.   Began observation @ approximately 21:35 CST and still ongoing as of 22:25 CST.  Object shape difficult to discern, only noticing extremely agile motions of this object, in a manner inconsistent of any known flight craft.   Reporting made to Saint Clair County Sheriffs Department via phone at approximately 21:45 CST.  Lighting appears to be multicolor red/blue/green as best as can be determined from presentation at this unknown distance, which I can best estimate as 3+ miles.  I notified two of my neighbors whom saw the same unknown object, and verify that this situation was indeed occuring as reported here.  Additionally, my wife came outside and observed same sighting for several minutes as well, until too cold to remain outside any longer. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the excellent report, but we believe that the witness may have been looking at Sirius, which is a very colorful object in the southeaster sky, currently.
