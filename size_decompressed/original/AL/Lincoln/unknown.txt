Two planes flying very close together , one with a contrail , the other had no contrail and just dissipated in a few seconds .;2011-05-21 19:50:00;10 seconds;Two planes flying very close together , one with a contrail , the other had no contrail and just dissipated in a few seconds . standing in my yard looking due west as the sun was 30 min from setting I noticed two planes heading east .. you could see the contrails from one plane but the other object had no contrail .. the object seemed to be a plane flying maybe 1000 ft to the right side of the plane and maybe 1000ft in front ..  but looked very close to the plane that had the contrail ...   suddenly it dispersed and was no longer seen from my position.  I watched the plane fly east all the way and the sun was still reflecting it .. the other object was not seen ...  in a way it  upset me as I don't know how to explain what it was ...   both the plane and object were shiny like a reflection off the plane .. I am a unemployed musician at this time ..  I have been in bands all over the world and have seen some pretty bazaar things over time ..  I do have almost a hour of missing time that still creeps me out when I think of it .. that event happened about 15 years ago ...  I would like for someone to try to help me with what I saw today ..;33.6058;-86.1106
