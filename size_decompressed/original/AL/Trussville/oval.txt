Very fast very large very bright ufo spotted over chalkville mtn rd trussville alabama 35235;2012-06-26 21:39:00;About 4 minutes;Very fast very large very bright ufo spotted over chalkville mtn rd trussville alabama 35235 It was a alot like a very large star! It moved across the sky for about 3 to 4 minutes it got really bright and big then slowly got smaller and disapeared! Me and my girlfriend both witnessed this and i believe my neighbor across the street saw it as well this is not the first time me or my gf have witnessed something like this one in our neighborhood! It didnt make any sound and had to be a very long distance away from earth! What ever it was it was big and fast! I know a little about jets and how fast they travel across the sky this thing was every bit of mach 2 or faster!  The way it disapeared was very unnatural i live in a flight path so i know what planes look like at nite this was for certain not anything from this earth!! It was seen on top of chalkville mtn rd close to walmart if there is anyway to search the radar history and post up any info id love to check back and see what you guys have found.. I have a little bit of video that i took with my ipho! ne but its not good at all:( id give it to u if you want it though..;33.6331;-86.5986999999999
