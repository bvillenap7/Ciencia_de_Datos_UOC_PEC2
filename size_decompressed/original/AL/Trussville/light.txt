UFO, resembling a star, flying across Trussville, AL in approximately 1993.;1993-06-15 22:00:00;about a minute;UFO, resembling a star, flying across Trussville, AL, in approximately 1993. The unidentified object that I witnessed most closely resembled a star (circular light), but slightly larger.  It was not flickering like a star typically might.  The object was moving north faster than an airplane typically would.  The object seemed to be flying in a straight line, not curving, etc.  The object had no sound that I could hear. At the time, I was approximately 13 years old.  I was travelling north on I-59 with my parents.  I did not attempt to draw their attention to the object, though I wished I had now knowing that having other witnesses helps collaborate a report.

These were not planes I know this for a fact.;2014-01-01 00:00:00;5 minutes;These were not planes i know this for a fact. I was on the roof of a buddies house at a party and we saw 6 red/orange lights in the sky and 3 where in an odd formation moving very slowly but still moving and the other three were almost below line of sight and then suddenly disappeared under the trees. then the lower three disappeared for about 2 minutes.    The other 3 lights were in a formation about 300 feet or so above the tree line then they each slowly disappeared on their own in sequence.   For about 3-5 minutes while the others disappeared I ran down stairs and got one of my friends to come check it out then when I got back on the roof of the house the bottom three orange/red lights appeared again above the tree line then randomly disappeared but not with a flash.   I really want to know that what I saw was not a plane or tower at all even my friends were skeptical that's why until today one of the people that was at the party said there were reports of the same lights we saw that night so I decided to make a report.   Keep in mind I had an iphone 4s on me and I could not record or take a picture the quality on my phone was too low to see the lights in the picture. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I would like to change the report I made previously to new years night I was mistaken on the date. ((END ADDUNDUM));33.6331;-86.5986999999999
