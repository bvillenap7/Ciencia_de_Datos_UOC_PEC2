The other two well to the North East of Florala seem to complete a full long circle flying pattern but then some what stopped, shifted or like slid in an instant change going from north to east.   It then completed the circle pattern and flew off north East till out of sight.   All 3 objects had the same series and sequence of white blinking lights.  There were no signs of red or green lights as on aircraft or helicopters.  It would flash 3 times in an interval then go dark for about ten seconds and repeat.  There were no visible distinction of an object shape, just lights and no sounds.   No other aircraft sounds were heard in this time frame or helicopters.   Florala is used by Fort Rucker for training flights, but no helicopter noises were heard.;31.0203;-86.3371
