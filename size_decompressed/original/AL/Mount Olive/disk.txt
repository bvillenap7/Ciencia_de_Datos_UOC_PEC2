It was about the size of the moon which was almost full.  We pulled over at a church parking lot and it was gone.  However, we noticed several flashes of multicolor light and a whirring sound.  As we looked in the sky we noticed an unusual amount of airplane activity in all points of sight. The planes were much smaller than the object we had seen only moments before.;33.6818;-86.8709
