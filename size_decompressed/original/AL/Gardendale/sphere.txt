The object was sphere shaped and changed colors.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star.  PD));2008-10-18 01:00:00;more than 20 minutes;I first noticed the object (only 1 object) on 10/11/08 - 10/13/08 between 8:30pm and 9:30pm.  The object was sphere shaped and changed colors (blue, red & white). It moved rapidly up and down and from left to right  sometimes it got much brighter. The background was the night sky.  It was located in the southeastern sky from 10/14 through 10/15. I didn't see the object on Thursday (10/16/08--probably because it was raining). The object (only 1 object) was seen again on Friday (10/17/08) and looked to be in the northeast sky and the object is described as the one above.  The time it was seen was approximately 11:45pm -1:20am. The object was seen tonight (10/18/08)this time there were (2) both were located in the northern sky but one was further to the left than the other.  The same shape, colors, brightness, up and down, from left to right and the erratic and rapid movement.  This one was witnessed by my son. All sightings were seen at night.  I don't know if it could have been a weather balloon but it was something that didn't move like an airplane or helicopter. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star.

Up to 9 Objects flying erratically and taking interest in several commercial planes. Birmingham, AL area;2013-09-14 19:45:00;4 hours;Up to 9 Objects flying erratically and taking interest in several commercial planes. Birmingham, AL area At around 19:45 central time I and my family were getting into our car preparing to go home after visiting my parents.  I looked up and noticed a dim light that seemed to just be a high flying plane traveling northbound but the object suddenly changed directions southbound. It did not turn it just changed direction from north to south.  When I saw this I called my wife and parents over to see what I was seeing.  As they were coming to see I turned on the video camera on my phone and began recording. After the initial light several more appeared up to 8 or 9 at one point. T hese lights were dim and looked like stars. They sped up and slowed down and made erratic course changes.  Many times they traveled in a circular course then would shoot off in a strait line.  These objects would also in 2s or 3s travel toward a common point and when they reached the common point (all at the same time) they would all change direction away from each other. Several times while watching these objects a plane would fly through the area of the sky where these objects were performing their maneuvers.  When a plane would fly through the area the objects in front of the planes would quickly move away to the side and then change course and follow the plane.  This happened at least 10 times.  On one occasion I watched one object come up behind a plane for maybe 2 seconds, then moved beside the plane for maybe another 2 seconds and then speed around in front of the plane and quickly move off to the north. 	At around 20:10 my wife, daughter and I drove up the road to see if we could see the objects better from another location.  After arriving at a local Arbys and getting a few sodas we looked in the direction of the objects and were not able to see them.  We then returned to my parentâ€™s home where we could once again see the objects. 	At 23:50 hours I reluctantly decided to return to my home so my wife and child could get some sleep. At this time there were still a few of the objects still flying around. I have to add that I have never seen anything like these objects nor had my wife or parents. I made 3 videos on my phone they are not very good quality and are shaky, but they do show some of the lights and maybe they can be of some use.;33.7188999999999;-86.8224999999996
Bright glowing orbs over Gardendale, Al.;2014-05-17 05:04:00;7 minutes;bright glowing orbs over Gardendale Al Approximately at 0504 this morning I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and noticed a really bright light.  I initially thought it was a star then I noticed it moving.  After I started watching it I then noticed that there were 2 more objects sitting relatively close to the brighter one.  I stated to move away from my apartment building to get a better look and the object started moving away from my sight and behind a tall group of pine trees.  I positioned myself at an angle to continue observing the object when without sound it shot across the sky towards Huntsville. I turned to go back into my apartment when I realized threw light had returned at a much lower altitude and moved just above a tree line about 100 yards from where I was standing.   I told my wife about the sighting when she woke up.   This evening around 21:40 we were both outside smoking and saw a very similar object dancing around in the sky but it was much further away than the 3 I saw this! morning.  This isn't a hoax or sham, nor is it an attempt for attention.  I spent 10 years in the military and have seen some strange things out at sea but I have never really been an up close witness nor was I a solid believer until today.;33.7188999999999;-86.8224999999996
