This has not been the first time that black helicopters of this type have come over and buzzed our trailer court! On more than one occasion, we have seen (3)back helicopters since June 13, 1999. My mom has also witnessed this event. I know this not a ufo report but I wanted to send a report anyway in hopes of finding what it could mean. Thanks, ((deleted)) from Birmingham (09/10/99) The full description is as follows: ................................ Black chopper (w/ 2 landing bars) Long tail Grey markings on both sides (2) occupants wearing what appeared to be military or government clothing (could not tell). Craft circled (3) times before speeding off to the west coming from the south. The chopper had to have been traveling at least 30 miles an hour flying overhead. We live near alot of trees and woods. The time approximately it took to circle was about (15) seconds at the most. They left, and about (2:20pm) they came back, this time they flew past our trailer and we grabbed our 35 millimeter camera and started to take a series of photos without them knowing and then they left. I didn't get to take any photos of it but I'll try next time!!! Mr. Davenport I wish not not to give my name for the safety of my family. I need to get in touch with you on another story I have concerning what my stepdad saw on the night of (July 3, 1999) He saw a ufo just coming home from getting dinner. He saw what looked like a huge ufo explode into strings of multi-colored lights ranging from white to red to blue and purple ect... What I want to do is send you a map of the area in wich we live so that you will know where to pinpoint the locations of these events individually. I believe that the event of (July 3, 1999) and the black helicopters are are connected. Please, I wish to remain anonymous but I give you permission to tell Art about these events when you appear on his program next tuesday night. Thanks for reading my letter! Keep up the good work!!! p.s. If you need more info concerning the times or locations, I will send them to you via snail mail.;33.7188999999999;-86.8224999999996
Strange object over Alabama, cloudy and spherical in shape.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));2007-12-10 18:00:00;2 hours;Strange object over Alabama, cloudy and spherical in shape. My brother and I and one of our friends were outside when I got home from work. They saw the object initially around 17:30 and claimed it to be much brighter than it was later on. They claimed the object moved erratically until it finally settled in an area straight up from our position. Initially, I thought the object was the recent comet that burst into a cloud as the object was cloudy with a prominent bright spot on the lower part of it. However, the comet shouldn't be as bright as this was nor was it in the right place... therein it wasn't the comet. Brother is a medical secretary, our friend is an aerospace engineering student, and I'm an advertising salesperson. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.
