UFO seen above Gardendale Alabama while driving on the interstate into work at 8:00 am.;2008-06-27 08:00:00;30 seconds;UFO seen above Gardendale Alabama while driving on the interstate into work at 8:00 am. I was driving into work at approximately eight o’clock in the morning, the morning of June 27th 2008. I was driving south on I-65 from Hayden Alabama down to Birmingham were I work and also have an apartment. As I was driving I noticed something off to my right, way off in the distance just sort of hovering above the trees. I describe it to my friends as if a giant man had a giant Frisbee turned on it’s side and flipping it up above the trees. It was on it’s side sort of spinning, it hovered for a second, then dropped like it was going to go back behind the trees, but as soon as it dipped down almost out of sight it came back up again hovered for a second again and began to rise slowly. At that point I drove behind a hill and couldn’t see it anymore, when I came out from behind the hill I looked for it but never saw it again. In a maybe unrelated incident, a few nights before I saw this my cell phone signal went out for a few hours, between the about 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. I finally got in touch with my cell phone provider and the man on the phone told me that service was out from Texas through Virginia, which he further explained was an unprecedented phenomena and they couldn’t explain why.;33.7188999999999;-86.8224999999996
