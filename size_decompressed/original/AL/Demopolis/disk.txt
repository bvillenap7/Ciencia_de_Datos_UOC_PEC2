We say this large disk shaped craft. It hovered about 2 minutes.lights were lighting up from outside to inside of the under part of the disk. It didnt make a sound. It wasnt there then it was.  It hovered for 2 minutes.  Then it was gone.  It scared us to death.  We went inside and told everyone.  Then we called the police and reported it.  Nothing happened.  No one believed us.  The craft was bigger than the hospital i was working at.  The people we told said it was a weather balloon.  Weather balloons dont look like that and aren't larger than a hospital.  Ill never FORGET.  But I cannot remember the exact date. Thanks;32.4916;-87.8389
