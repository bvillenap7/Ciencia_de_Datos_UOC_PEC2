a light over the mountain;2008-10-01 21:00:00;minutes;a light over the mountain What I saw was a bright small light over the mountain close to where I live it happens  all the time, sometime there are days or weeks in between or a month or two but it always comes back. Sometime there are two lights one up high the other low. It looks like that they move  or they sit there then the light just goes out ,but they come back then go away again it really weird this has happened several times thru the last couple of years and drove me crazy. So I am telling someone at last,  thank you  very much ._  karan angle;33.8211;-85.891
Lights moving in pattern in clouds.;2014-03-27 20:32:00;continuous;Lights moving in pattern in clouds There was lights going in a pattern in the sky on a cloud.  The lights seem to move to different clouds and they seem to still follow a pattern.  This is in the country so no big events could cause the lights and they were very large.
