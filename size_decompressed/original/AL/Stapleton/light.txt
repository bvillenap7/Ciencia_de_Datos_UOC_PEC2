One of the two lights would flicker and weave slowly back and forth.  It seemed as if the lights would dull to almost a disappearing light, then get all of the sudden get brighter.  The lights were a normal light bulb color, and sometimes would flicker with red.  The lights moved very slow, took about 15 minutes to notice it actually moving.  They followed the same path.  One lighter was brighter than the other, and both seem to be fading and coming back.  It also seemed as if they were rising, and moving from the east toward the south.  I watched for about 20 mins, then they faded behind the tree line.  I know they were not stars, because of the weaving motion. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter??
