Low flying angular object seen near Hollis Crossroads. Heflin, Alabama. Jan. 28 2006;2006-01-28 18:15:00;a few seconds;Low flying angular object seen near Hollis Crossroads. Heflin, Alabama. Jan. 28 2006 Me and three friends were on our way to Anniston, Alabama in two seperate vehicles. It was around 6 and it was dusk. There was still light in the sky and we could see an outline of the object we saw soon after. We had just turned at Hollis Crossroads and were driving down the road when we saw what was either a very low flying object, or an enormous object at a higher altitude. It was trianglular with a flashing green light on it. It moved slowly, or slower than a plane would, across our field of vision, which was the windshield since it was almost directly above us.  There were trees on either side of the road and it took up most of what part of the sky we could see. We called our friends in the other vehicle to ask them if they saw it, and they said they had and described it like we did. They were about 30 seconds in front of us and said they saw it going the other direction, as if it made a loop or a circle. There wasn't any airfield near by that we know about and it didn't look like any plane we had ever seen. If it was an airplane, it would have to be either landing, taking off, flying way too low, or gigantic. When we arrived at school the following Monday we found that 1 or 2 other people had seen the same thing at the same location. It was unlike anything we had ever seen.;33.6095;-85.5863
