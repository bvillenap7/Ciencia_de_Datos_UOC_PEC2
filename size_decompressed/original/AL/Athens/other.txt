A command module looking craft.;2020-09-28 15:00:00;5 seconds;A command module looking craft. At approximately 1500 hours I witnessed an object traveling East to West across North Jefferson Street/ Alabama HWY 127. I was walking North along the side of the hwy, the object was white in color and had a cylinder shaped section on the top with what appeared to be a bubble window. The bottom of the object was cone shaped with a silver flat bottom. To be completely honest I swear that what I was a Saturn 5 command module. I saw it for about 5 seconds and just vanished and  it made no sound.;34.8166765765765;-86.9427522522523
