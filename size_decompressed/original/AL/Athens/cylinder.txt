Cylinder shaped object travelling at high rate of speed.  No contrail, no sound.;2003-07-05 19:40:00;<2 minutes;Cylinder shaped object travelling at high rate of speed.  No contrail, no sound. My husband and I saw a cylinder-shaped object in the partly cloudy sky.   At first, I thought I was looking at an aircraft, but this object had no wings, no contrail, and no sound.  It appeared to be at a very high altitude, but this is difficult to penpoint, as I don't know how large the object was.  However, there was an airplane traveling from North to South at a high altitude leaving a contrail.   The object in question was travelling from east to west at what appeared to be a high velocity.  It literally streaked across the sky in a matter of minutes, two a most, and then disappeared into the horizon.  It reminded me of looking at a comet, but this object was moving too fast.  Background--> husband is a NASA engineer at MSFC I am a high school biology teacher.   I am so confounded by what I saw.  It fits no logical category of any flying craft that I am aware of.  I am a skeptical person by nature, but I know what I saw was not an airplane.   We live in Huntsville but were in Athens visiting relatives.;34.8166765765765;-86.9427522522523
