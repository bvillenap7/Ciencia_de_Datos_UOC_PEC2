Bright light  appearing over Athens, Alabama  and then winked out;2008-05-23 02:15:00;10 seconds;Bright light  appearing over Athens, Alabama  and then winked out On above date and time, my wife and I were standing on the back porch smoking. We were facing due south and the sky was clear and the Moon and Mars were brightly visible. Suddenly a bright light appeared in the sky, about a palms width east of the Moon and Mars. It was traveling slowly in a easterly direction. I could barely make out a saucer shape on the rt. side of the light. The light was about one and a half times the brightness of the moon. Suddenly the object took off so fast that it appeared to wink out. It was a very quiet night and there was no sound of any aircraft at the time. My wife is a RN and I am a retired Police Officer. I am 65 and this is not the first time we have witnessed a unexplained sighting. This one was not very dramatic compared to what I've seen before. Just curious if anyone else might have reported something that night.;34.8166765765765;-86.9427522522523
Huge, motionless, multicolored ball of light in tree lines.;2011-08-23 05:00:00;approx. 10 min.;Huge, motionless, multicolored ball of light in tree lines. My husband was standing out on our porch smoking and saw a huge multicolored ball looking light right above the trees.  He took a picture with his phone. It is grainy however, you can see spots all around it that appear to be stars.  He said the object was silent, very very bright..much bigger and brighter than the stars around it and it was multicolored.  He says it stayed motionless right above the tree line for about 10 mintues.  He said he could tell it was huge judging by the size of the stars around it.   Unfortunately, I was still asleep and he did not bother to wake me!  I was hoping someone else saw this. The light ball thing he showed me on his phone is soooo bright!  It is different than a light bulb or the sunlight!  The area is near and around Clements 72 West.  Also, object made No sound.;34.8166765765765;-86.9427522522523
