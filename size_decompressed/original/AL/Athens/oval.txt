The power was out everywhere.  looking at the night sky, was a bright full moon. was hoping to get a good view of the stars, with the power out.  But the moon was so bright, was not able to get a good view of the stars.  looking toward the western sky I see a very bright orange light, moving at high speed.  Moving from west to east. It had a oval shape.  It had no contrail, made no sound.   I was in the USAF.  I know what I saw was not any kind of winged aircraft, or meteor.  i estimate it past within a mile or two from were I live.  I went around the back of the complex to see if i see more of it.  But it was already gone.  Spoke to a man that lives next to me said He saw it also.;34.8166765765765;-86.9427522522523
