White orb with multi-colored lights.;2012-10-15 21:00:00;30 minutes;White orb with multi-colored lights. About 21:00 in late 2012, after returning home from a movie, I and a friend noticed a white orb hovering behind my house, as we pulled into my driveway.  The distance was roughly 3/4 a mile away, the exact location of the object was about 50-80ft above the ground, and about roughly 34°27'25.8N 86°40'56.9W.  I went to my truck and got a pair of binoculars, and upon a closer look, the object appeared to be a white orb with multi-color pulsating light orbiting the main object.  There was no sound and no odd smells or conditions.   My estimate of the size (since I am very well with the that exact area) I would say it was about the size of a small/compact car.   We observed the object for about 30 minutes and the we went inside.   I tried taking pictures of the object but my camera wouldn't focus on it.
