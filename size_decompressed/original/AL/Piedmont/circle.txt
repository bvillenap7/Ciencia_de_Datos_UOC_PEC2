We saw lights flashing over the city approx 3 miles away from our home - my husband asked me to get the video camera and come out to see this - the objects were hovering at first and were flashing white - red - green - blue lights - one color at a time - and then the objects begain to move around the general area - some would hover then move quickly to another area and then they would hover - when some would move - they would move very quickly.  I tried to contact the Calhoun County EMA but got an elderly woman and man and he said that he was not aware of any 'manuver's in the area but that he was only a volunteer.  We live 16 miles from Ft. McClellan Army Base and and also 25 miles from Amminston Army Depot - where a chemical weapons incinerator is located.  For the next several weeks - from time to time - we would see these same objects in the sky at night -  I videoed the first ones we saw - approx one hour in length.  Also, I am not certain of the date - even the month - I will find the video tape and get the exact date and time and will forward that info on to you.  Thank you, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));33.8389;-85.6460000000002
