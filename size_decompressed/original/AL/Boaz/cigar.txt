I only took my eyes off it for maybe a sec to peer over the top of my car . Immediately I wanted to call the police but my friend said we shouldn't ..shortly before this on my way home going down double bridges roa! d in Boaz I saw what I thought was a shooting star as I was saying my wish it turned and shot off the other direction...I've never seen anything since nor have I seen aliens but I know this was not our technology. Im 40 now and I've tried to forget this and ignore it but I cant,wish I had never seen this but now that I have kids I feel I should be honest with them;34.1758019230769;-86.1770846153846
