Property located in NW corner of Tuscaloosa County, AL.  Direction of object would be to west of property.  As first observers turned notherly and drove .2 miles to a paved road they continued to see the object to the west.  They returned to the home and object was observed by 4 adults for approximately 45 minutes before disappearing from view (perhaps behind trees & hills).  One observer called 911 to report and asked for telephone number to Columbus Air Force Base (Columbus, MS). I was given number to Command Post 601-((number deleted)) and I think the person I talked with was named Brady.  He told me they were not and could not launch aircraft to check out situation because of holiday weekend and the fact they had no aircraft were presently flying.  He called me back with telephone number to the UFO Center (206-722-3000).  I could not reach a person due to holiday but was given web site address.  Therefore I am reporting it  via that site on July 5, 1999.  You may contact me with questions via e-mail but I cannot accept collect telephone calls.  You may call at your expense if you are interested in doing so. ((2nd message)) Thank you for your quick reply.  I have a typo correction to make.   The question #240 address state should be AL (Alabama) not GA (Georgia). Also, I will be forwarding a map to you to identify the location where the  sighting occurred and a sketch of what the object looked like to 2 of the 4  observers. I will look at the other new reports with interest. I must admit that I was uneasy and a little frightened by what I saw. Sincerely, ((Name deleted));33.2880490291261;-87.5796985436894
Seven flashing lights in a V patteren flying over Northport Alabama.;2013-04-08 19:07:00;10 or less;Seven flashing lights in a V patteren flying over Northport Alabama. On 4/08/13 at approx. 1907hrs., I was traveling southwest on Union Chapel Road in Northport Alabama.  I stopped at the Yield sign because of oncoming traffic from Martin Road. I was also talking on the phone. I noticed in the sky these lights that were in a bird flying pattern, a sideways V, with the point of the V pointing to the right or east.  I asked my nieces who were with me, do y’all see that? They both replied, “Yes”. I pulled over about 30 feet from where I first saw them and exited my vehicle. I was still talking on the phone with my Dad.  I was telling him about these UFOs.  He said they were probably big birds reflecting light.  I know they were not birds. Birds fly with the point of the V in front. These UFOs were traveling toward the open end of the V, or west bound. There were seven individual lights.  There were five on the top row and two on the bottom.  They were moving very slowly. Eventually they faded out of sight one by one.  I waited to ! see if more would come back or to see what would happen. Two more rose from the tree line, flickered and then vanished.  My Dad still says they were large birds. I disagree. I do not know if anyone else saw these.  Thank you for your attention in this matter.;33.2880490291261;-87.5796985436894
