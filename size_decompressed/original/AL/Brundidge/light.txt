My husband and I came home from work and noticed flashes of light just below the Big Dipper.  There were about six of these objects which resembled stars, but they were independently flashing and moving off to the right one behind the other at a fantastic rate of speed, much too fast for a man-made object, arcing down to the horizon.   As they reached the horizon they got closer together and began to cluster then they went out of view. My husband and I work in the education field.  I teach, and he recruits.  We are frequently on the road late into the night all across the nation, and this display in the sky was mind-boggling.  We have never seen anything like this before.  It would help if anyone else saw this.;31.6972;-85.8178
