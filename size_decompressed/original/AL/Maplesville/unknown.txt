((anonymous report));2019-08-29 14:49:00;Unknown;I have been hearing a low rumbling sound outside for the past 2-3 nighrs.  I do not see any aircraft of any sort.  Natural or unnatural.  The sound itself is eerie enough to frighten you back into your home.  It's so loud and deep I can hear it in my home.  It sounds as if a rocket is about to take off, and it's coming from the woods from across the highway.  It sounds maybe a mile away at best.
