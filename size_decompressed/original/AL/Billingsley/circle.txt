I went to kitchen window where I observed a round pulsating stationary craft. It was above the tree line but directly in my view. My daughter was awake with sick baby & witnessed everything. We’ve seen them before but to far to video. This one was practically in the back yard. As I went out the side door of our kitchen, there was another one in front of house. They were low with red, green, a yellow orange lights. As I was panning the sky for more there was at least 4 more in the distance all around the house. The ones in the distance I couldn’t make out if there was one or a cluster. I was in such awe that I was seeing not 1 but many. Only the 2 were more visible than others. It was amazing. We see them all the time. In the videos you can actually see them spin & pulsate. We also see planes a lot so we know the difference. These were stationary for over 45 minutes & I waved & went inside. Last time the one came back 3 nights in a row in the same ar! ea. Too far to take picture or video but these last night were great!! Video & still pics do no justice! It was awesome!;32.6569;-86.7157
