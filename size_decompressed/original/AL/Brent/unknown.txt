On 3/20/14 it flashed then 3 lights came on and went off left to right.   Side note on both nights fighter jets where chasing craft, also it sounds like there is thunder when this craft is seen but no clounds or bad weather is any where close.   The space between lights is big enough to place a commercial jet between them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));32.9397;-87.2108
