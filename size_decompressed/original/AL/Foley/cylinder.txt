Triangular/Cyinder object with 2 headlights like a car in the sky sitting completely still and had no sound;2010-10-14 18:30:00;about 30 seconds;Triangular/Cyinder object with 2 headlights like a car in the sky sitting completely still and had no sound I was driving down CO. Rd. 65 heading North. Was creeping up to the intersection of 65 and Highway 98. Saw what appeared to be a car in the sky. Had two bright, white headlights. As I got closer, I saw it had a cylinder/triangular shape to it. It hovered... It wasn't moving at all! No Sound.. My redlight was green and there were 4 cars in front of me, all stopped.  Also at the 4-way, there were a total of about 15-20 cars all stopped from different directions looking, too.  I snapped a picture on my cell phone, blurry of course, before I stopped. I don't understand! It didn't move- it completely sat still! It didn't make a sound. No motor sound or anything...I was looking at the picture I took to see if it was blurry or not and I realized I should take more pictures anyways.  So I leaned out my window to take another photo and it was gone..  No sound, no lights, nothing. Gone. I would not like to be contacted by number.  Please if any information is needed or known, please email me.;30.4025097222222;-87.686861111111
