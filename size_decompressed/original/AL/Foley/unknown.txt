I (the Mother) thought it might be lightning so I went out to the pool to extinquish the tiki torches surrounding the pool when I looked up & noticed 4 very bright stars in the distance. Because I swim at night alot, I know that I've never seen these stars before. They were in a straight line & were changing colors. (red, blue or green & white)I went inside & brought out my binoculars for a better look. They were stationary for about 10 minutes & then I watched one of them move (very quickly) higher that the other three & stop again. Then I noticed 2 more to the West of the other 4. I observed them for several minutes. Occasionally one of them would rapidly change positions so that the line was no longer straight. After about 30 minutes of watching this I went back inside the house because the fire ants were biting my feet & ankles & my kids were very frightned. The objects were quite a distance from my home so I couldn't make out a shape. I live approximately 10 miles from the gulf coast in the country away from any bright lights & the objects were to the South appearing to me to be over the gulf. I wish I could have gotten a closer look but my binoculars are not very good & my children were upset. I did not see the flashes of light that the kids had seen before I went outside. I separetly asked both of them to describe the flashes to me & they both described the same thing. They said it was just a bluish white flash of light like a camera's flash bulb going off only much, much bigger. If someone wishes to contact me, I don't have any objections to that.;30.4025097222222;-87.686861111111
Two different craft seen moments apart.;2016-10-07 00:00:00;15 seconds;Two different craft seen moments apart. A large, crescent-shaped object moved through the sky at a constant speed and altitude.  The object had no lights and appeared to take on the color of its environment- the night sky. Its outline was visible, and it made no noise.  It made me and my friend very uneasy.   Moments after, a smaller, sphere-shaped craft moved erratically through the sky at a lower altitude with a greater speed.  It appeared to be brown in color with no lights.  It quickly vanished into thin air.;30.4025097222222;-87.686861111111
