slow, star like image that slowly faded away;2001-11-18 04:30:00;15-20 seconds;slow, star like image that slowly faded away I'm not sure what I witnessed - don't want to say it was a UFO but it was strange.  I set my alarm for 4:30 am to observe the meteor shower on 11/18/01.  Went outside, sat down, and watched the sky for about 10 -15 minutes.  I noticed a star-like object that appeared to be moving very slowly (like a slow airplane)to the south west of my home.  At first, I thought it was an airplane but then realized that it was WAY too high to be an airplane so then I thought that it could maybe be a meteor but it was too slow for that - plus didn't have a tail.  I watched the object move across the sky and curve back to the right and disappear (or fade out) beside a star.  I thought that it was weird, as I have never seen anything like that before.  I waited about 10 more minutes to see if I could see it again but it never came back.  I got the creeps and went inside! I wouldn't mind being contacted regarding this sighting, but not sure if it's anything exciting enough to prompt investigation.;30.4025097222222;-87.686861111111
Unknown craft aerobatic and very fast.;2018-07-19 10:30:00;2 minutes;Unknown craft aerobatic and very fast. While walking my dog, I always watch the sky when I hear a jet as we live so close to Pensacola NAS to see if the Blue Angels are around.  I did not see any in the area, but an extremely high object caught my eye.  I can't be positive of the shape due to the height it was flying but it traveled approximately 1 foot in sight then slowed to almost a stop, did a 360 degree turn (in a space about the size of my fingernail) and took off at approximately 3x the speed it was traveling and disappeared into the clouds.  The object was heading West to East and finally headed Southwest.  I have never seen any jet perform a 360 degree turn in this small of space and at that height.   Object was white in color and the weather was sunny with feathery clouds.   If I had to guess at the height, I would say it was 40,000 to 50,000 feet.;30.4025097222222;-87.686861111111
