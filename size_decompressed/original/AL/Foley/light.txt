Two sets of orange lights seen over Foley, Alabama.;2012-12-27 19:00:00;3-4 minutes;Two sets of orange lights seen over Foley, Alabama Four adults returning from dinner observe two sets of orange lights low in the sky from their car.  The lights were three blocks from their homes.  One set was a semi circle.  The second set was in a triangle shape.  They turned onto a side street to observe.  The lights began to blink out one at a time till they were all gone.  No sound come from the lights.  Being a UFO investigator for many years I conclude these lights may have been attached to objects but it was too dark to see the objects.  I come to this conclusion because the lights were evenly space on both the triangle and semi circle and blinked out one at a time in succession.;30.4025097222222;-87.686861111111
3 Bright orange orbs in Foley, AL.;2013-05-30 21:30:00;30 minutes;3 Bright orange orbs in Foley, AL 3 Bright orange circular objects in sky. My mom and little sister were out on the balcony, my mother was smoking. My little sister came inside and told me to come look at the orange light in the sky so I went and looked. At first there was just one orange orb in the sky. it was too bright to be a star. and it didn't leave a smoke trail like a flare. it was bright for about 15 seconds then faded. Then the orange orb appeared again, but in a different location, close to where the first light was seen. It was bright then faded also. My mom and little sister went in but i stayed out on the balcony for a few minutes and a 3rd light appeared but further away than the other two. it wasn't as bright neither. It faded away also. I continued to wait and see if anything else was going to happen. A plane flew by in the area where the lights were seen. It got about (from my perspective) 200 ft away and all 3 lit up brightly at the same time. Stayed that way for probably 20 seconds then faded. They didn't light back up. No noise. No smoke trail. Just bright orange orbs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));30.4025097222222;-87.686861111111
