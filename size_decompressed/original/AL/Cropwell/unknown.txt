Initially thought it was a plane on fire, but continued to fly south in our direction.   The the craft/object then headed west, and then accelerated north and disappeared.  Clear moonlit sky.  No sound was heard from craft/object.   If placed inside the moon, the object would be close to touching the edges of the moon (for size reference).;33.5306;-86.3051

As I was looking up toward the sky I saw what looked like a flame coming towards us.  I began to think it was a plane on fire that was about to crash heading in our direction.   It began to descend so close, I almost panicked then it started ascending again.   From where I was standing in the lake it began to go toward my left in the direction of Pell City.  I had to walk further in the water to keep it in sight so the trees weren't blocking my view.  Within a few seconds it was no longer visible at all.  I found this strange because of how slowly it was descending.  This was the strangest thing I have ever witnessed in my life.;33.5306;-86.3051
