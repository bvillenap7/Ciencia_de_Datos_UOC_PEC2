We first observed a bright, white light that seemed to be rapidly traveling from the south to a northeasterly direction in the eastern sky.  It then dropped below the tree line after several minutes.   The second sighting we observed was a few minutes later in the western sky.  The second object was a massive bright, white light which looked to be an order of magnitude larger than Venus in the night sky.  It remained stationary in the western sky for approximately 15 minutes before moving out of sight behind the mountain range.   There was no sound, flickering or varying in intensity.  The sky was clear with no clouds present.;34.6234;-86.463
