2 triangular ships over my sons football game;2006-08-22 20:00:00;10 minutes;2 triangular ships over my sons football game While leaving the parking lot of my sons football game last night, two triangular craft were no more than 20 feet above the road, it was VERY clearly seen by everyone leaving.  I pulled over to point them out to my son.   They hovered (or flew very very slowly) over the road and across the field before rising up and flying away.  The whole thing dragged out for what seemed like 10 minutes (when my gutt says it should have taken a minute to two minutes).  They were both triangular, black on the bottom, red light in the center, a white/yellow light on each triangular tip.  Both were 25-30 feet in length.  My sons response was like he was no at all surprised by seeing them.;34.9131;-86.7042
I walked out of my garage.  And there was one light above the Treeline.  Then it lit up with lights all the way around the triangle.;2018-09-24 08:30:00;Huge triangle;I walked out of my garage.  And there was one light above the Treeline.  Then all of a sudden it lit up with lights all the way around the triangle and one huge round light in the center that was white and red.  The lights were so bright it has hurt my eyesight my eyes are dry and hurting.;34.9131;-86.7042
