My wife and I were delivering the local paper sunday morning in seperate vehicles but in the same general location and we both agreed when we discussed it later that we had seen exactly the same thing. I has gotten out of my truck to place a customers paper in his tube when I noticed the area becoming very brightly illuminated and when I looked up to discover the source of the illumination I noticed a very bright fireball in the southern sky. The object resembled a ball like would be released from a roman candle as it emmited sparks as it traveled across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Correct date of event is 05DE99.  Date is corrected here.
