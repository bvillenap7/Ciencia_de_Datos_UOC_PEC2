I was walking on the street in my neighborhood talking on the phone until I looked up in the sky and it was ten feet away I saw the ufo ship and it was the size of a house and it had red and blue and white lights blinking on and on.  It was floating to the height of the tree line.  It was flashing this beam of light down.  But the light was blue.  The ship was round.  I think it's looking for something.
