craft just above the trees moving slowly, silent,circular solid white light. witnessed by 5 of us;1970-03-30 21:00:00;2 minutes;craft just above the trees moving slowly, silent,circular solid white light. witnessed by 5 of us Five of us were observing the moon with my new telescope. Our ages ranged from 11 to 14 I was the first to notice the craft. I look west and said look everyone what is that. They thought I was pulling their legs. But as soon as they saw the craft  their attitude changed. The craft was just above the pecan trees. A circular light that was I guess about 50 feet in diameter. It glowed white light. No other lights were on the craft. It did not seem to light up the area. It was completely silent. It was traveling slowly. It passed direcly over us. It seem to be losing altitude very slowly. It passed over my house toward the back yard. My friend ran to his house a half block from my house to get his binoculars. When he got there the craft was stopped over his house. It hovered for a few seconds he said and then shot off at high speed toward the north. The rest of us did not see it shoot off. I live 30 miles away from an army flight training center and I am familiar with aircraft. This craft was in no way familiar to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
