Immediate u- turn. no noise.;2012-11-01 21:00:00;2 minutes;immediate u- turn. no noise. I came out to let my dog use the bathroom and was walking with her to the back yard.  I looked up above the trees on the mountain behind the house and seen three rectangular lights in a triangle shadow moving slow with no noise at all.  It was coming straight at me but then did an immediate u-turn and slowly went back over the trees.  I knocked on the back door and had my wife come look at it and as soon as she seen it, it shot off very fast. It did make a sound like loud wind.;33.9259;-86.4741
