Big,  round , with lights,  but no sound,  moving slow,;1974-10-22 20:00:00;10 sec;Big,  round , with lights,  but no sound,  moving slow, father - grandfather - uncle - me  standing outside one nite in the driveway about 9 pm. father said look up, what is that, we all looked up, something round about 2-3 times higher than the trees was moving over, it had lights on it, no sound if you was not looking up  then you would not have known it was there, I was too ? to chase it on foot, if I had a 30-06 with a big clip we would have a real ufo now maybe. I aways thought why would ufos need lights on it, but it was a real ufo. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));33.9259;-86.4741

3 AM 6 bright lights rotating in perfect circle, made no noise;2020-06-18 03:00:00;10-15 seconds;3 AM 6 bright lights rotating in perfect circle, made no noise Couldn't sleep, walked outside to smoke cigarette and while I was messing around on my phone I was getting ready to put it up so I lock the screen but it was still really bright outside so I look straight up and it's like five maybe six really bright lights rotating in a circle going in a straight line across the sky.  I brush it off as maybe some kind of new us unmaned drone but it was so close to the ground and dead silent..  I haven't stopped thinking about it;33.9259;-86.4741
