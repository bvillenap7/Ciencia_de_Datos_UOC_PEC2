Five orange lights in baldwin county no sound that i could hear;2012-05-12 22:00:00;5-7 min;five orange lights in baldwin county no sound that i could hear Last night as I left my grandma's house I noticed strange bright orange lights above the tree line.  I stopped and tried to take a photo with my phone but it could not reach the lights.  They appeared to be round objects that I could see for about 4 miles that did not leave the area.  They were flying in a strange pattern, and were not any craft I have ever seen flying at night before.  I was trying to see if anyone else saw this, and if it was something or just normal aircraft.  I am a married and a mother of two about to finish my bachalors. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));30.8601;-87.7645
