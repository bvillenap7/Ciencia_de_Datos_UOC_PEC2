I noticed that the sky looked like it drop to the earth because the stars were so close.  I really looked at the stars and noticed that they were flickering green, red then yellow.  I noticed 2 more that shot straight up.  I almost had a stroke.  I tried to record them however I only got me and my daughter voice it was to dark. I am very confused about this.   I wanted to call the police but scared they would arrest me thinking I was crazy.  The three were levitating and moving side to side.  While the bigger one was flashing white lights.  I was so scared my daughter said, Momma, I don't think we are supposed to be seeing this.  My bff was on the phone with me I tried to record but if you could hear us you would know it's true.   I put chairs to the doors and stayed up all night.  I wanted to knock on my neighbor's door.  I know someone else seen this in Phenix City, Al..;32.482525510204;-85.0617091836735
