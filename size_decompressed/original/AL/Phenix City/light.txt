I see slow moving, star like objects every night for over a year now. Some are slower, higher elevation and seem to zig zag. Some pulsate on and off completely and fade out after a minute or so. A few flying a little faster and lower have responded to flashlight by brightening up extremely bright after I've flashed them with light. They dim back down and continue on path. One responded 3 times in a row to flashlight. Last night 10-22-2014, there were three together flying in a Triangle formation, each taking turns getting bright.;32.482525510204;-85.0617091836735
