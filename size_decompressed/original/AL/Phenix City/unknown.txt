Extremely fast light in low sky.;2009-09-15 21:30:00;2 seconds;Extremely fast light in low sky. We were driving home when a light shot over us and was gone in a second.  It was approximately 50-100 yards above the top of the trees and power lines. The only thing that comes to mind is a jet of some kind, but it was extremely too low to be a jet.  It moved as quickly as a shooting star but extremly bright and low.   About 3 minutes before, we saw a jumper plane overhead that was going towards FT Benning.   Would love to know what it was.;32.482525510204;-85.0617091836735
Large Bright Light - Alabama;2017-01-26 19:00:00;3-5 seconds;Large Bright Light - Alabama On Thursday January 26, 2017, at approximately 19:10 (+/-5), while looking in the WSW sky (240 degrees) I and two others were looking at Stars, Constellations and Mars/Venus.  After showing them Mars/Venus using my Astro-Binoculars, I looked up (naked eye) and we all saw a second bright light (as bright as and appeared as large as the size of Venus (in the night sky) and it covered Mars. It traveled towards our direction (1 second) and then turned left (3-4 seconds) as the bright light faded away.  As Private Pilot, I quickly noticed no navigational lights (Red/Green/or Red/White Flashing light).;32.482525510204;-85.0617091836735
