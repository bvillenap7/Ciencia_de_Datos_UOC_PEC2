The three lights was bright enough to show the full belly of the object which once round and full underneath.  It was gliding lower than aircrafts fly.  I turned around in the middle of the road.  Went to the store in the hill and it was no where to be spotted.  It was gone just like that.  So i called the airport which was not open.   Then I called the air-traffic control tower, but not flights was going in or out at that time.;32.482525510204;-85.0617091836735
