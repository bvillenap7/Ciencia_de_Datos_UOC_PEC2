It traveled directly overhead.   Its movement was similar to a hockey puck on an air hockey table.  No sound and when it was directly overhead it seemed cloaked to mimic the clouds.  Moon light kept its shape visible.   The altitude was similar to plane height at air show planes.  Craft was visible for approximately 30 seconds.;32.482525510204;-85.0617091836735
