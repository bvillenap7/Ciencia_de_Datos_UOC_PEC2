bright object hovering in sky during lightning storm Phenix city, Al;2009-08-11 22:00:00;56 minutes;bright object hovering in sky during lightning storm Phenix city, Al We were experiencing a really strong  lightening storm. My husband stepped out onto the porch  and after a couple of minutes he called me to the porch. The storm was really bad and no light should have been viewable in the sky other than a plane. He pointed to the  eastern sky and ask me if the bright light was moving. I watched for a couple of minutes and  we both agreed that what ever was in the sky that night was not moving. It was a large bright light just hovering  in the middle of the storm. I went and got the binoculars and  we took turns looking at the object. Through the binoculars you could see that the object had  a rectangular shape with orange lights running down both sides. We knew that no helicopter would be just hovering in one spot during such a powerful lightning storm. As the storm grew worse the object became brighter and still sit hovering. It hovered there for about 56 minutes and suddenly it was just gone. We have no answers for what we saw Tuesday night. It was a frightening , yet intriguing site.  I am afraid of bad storms but  even I could not resist watching this object during the storm. I am wondering if anyone else happened to see this spectacular site on  08/11/09 between 10pm and 11 pm.;32.482525510204;-85.0617091836735
