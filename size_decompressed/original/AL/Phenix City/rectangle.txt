As we look in amazment it had no sound and a bright light came on it was less than fifth feet off the ground.  It turn very slowly toward the right like it was about to run into the plant it pause for about ten seconds and than moved on over the plant and it was gone.   My co-worker ask me what was that i told him it was a UFO while my heart was beating 200 mph.  The next day i figuer out why it showed up there and why.  We both work in maintenance ad we install some eltronic device on the roof i'm not going to say what but one off the three malfunction and was stuck on sending out a constant pluse and the red light on the device was constantly flashing. I been looking every nite sence and i have not seen it any more.;32.482525510204;-85.0617091836735
