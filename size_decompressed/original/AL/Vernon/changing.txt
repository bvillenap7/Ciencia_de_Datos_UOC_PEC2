Blinding, white, cigar, shape-shifting craft, seen in Vernon, Alabama.;2017-08-16 16:00:00;2-3 minutes;Blinding, white, cigar, shape-shifting craft, seen in Vernon, Alabama. We were driving down highway 17 from Sulligent, Alabama to Vernon, Alabama, at 4 p.m. central time.  I noticed there was a object in the sky flying along over the treetops.   The object was a blinding white cigar shaped craft.  It then changed shape to a fat line.  There was a slight glow around the object as well.   It was flying slowly along going in the opposite direction that we were driving in.  Then it vanished.  My daughter saw it also.;33.7618;-88.0979
