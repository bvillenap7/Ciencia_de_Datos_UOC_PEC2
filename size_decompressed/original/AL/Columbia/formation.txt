I approach everything with skepticism. I'll be the first to call most sightings a big pile of bologna. But this report, is entirely accurate. This report, I saw with my own eyes. Let me get started by explaining the sighting in its entirety. It was just before sunset, I was facing east looking toward a tree line.  Out of my peripheral vision I noticed 4-5 orange glowing orbs in the cloud line.  They seemed to be moving in some type of formation, appearing and reappearing at will.  They danced around in what I would describe as a figure eight like motion for the majority of the time I was able to see them.   One of the orbs shot across the entire sky until no longer visible, followed by the remaining anomalies at an alarming rate of speed.  They were there, and then they were just gone.  No sound, no reflection , no nothing, just gone.   Ok, so no big deal right?  Unless I were to take you back to my childhood, in which I saw the exact same type of anomaly, but not yet old enough to understand the difference.  I would not have even thought to much about it, had it not been for a Youtube.com video I recently viewed, depicting the exact same experience I have mentioned here.;31.334;-85.1483
