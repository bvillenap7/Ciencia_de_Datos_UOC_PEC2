I don't know what the hell that is;1985-08-16 19:00:00;1.5;I was only 14 when I went outside to get away from the plumbers beating and nailing,when I saw this object that resembled something like a fighter jet.But this was huge and gave off all types of colors with no sound.I'm not a scientist,but it looked like all types of gases came together to form it because how abstract all the colors were.Just random,green,yellow,red,etc.Bright colors.I ran inside to get my mother.She went back to get the plumber.His reply wasI don't know what the hell that isIn about an hour,it very slowly faded away.Later that night it made the news as a weather ballon.I have yet to see a weather ballon or any other ballon resemble this.
