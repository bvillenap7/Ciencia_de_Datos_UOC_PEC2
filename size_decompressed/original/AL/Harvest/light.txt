I stood up and pointed at them to the person with me, at the exact moment I pointed at them, one shot off at a high speed and disappeared, the other shot down directly at us within 2-3 seconds, at that point we ran back into the house, not looking back to the sky.   Around 30 seconds to 1 minute later we went back outsite to put the fire out and witnessed one of the objects hovering in the distance for a few seconds and then disappeared.  The objects made no noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.8296;-86.7453999999999
