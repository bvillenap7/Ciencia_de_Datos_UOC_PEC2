Unidentified lights hovering above empty field in Harvest, Alabama;2011-01-28 21:35:00;3 minutes;Unidentified lights hovering above empty field in Harvest, Alabama We were driving westbound on Harvest Road from Hwy 53 and saw a bright light in the treeline ahead of us to the southwest.   As we approached, we saw that what we thought was one bright light was in fact 4 lights pulsing slowly- green, red & white.   We assumed we were looking at a low-flying plane or helicopter, but as we got closer we could not see the body of the craft at all.   It must have been a dark color and non-reflective surface as we could not see the reflection of the lights on the surface of the object.   At our closest, the object was approximately 250 yards to the left of our vehicle, hovering 75-100 feet above an empty field.    As we passed this field, we were able to rule out a radio/cell phone tower or water tower as the source of the lights as they were very clearly hovering over the middle of the empty field.   Stunned, we turned around in a gas station parking lot to return for another look only to find that the object had completely disappeared in a matter of 30-45 seconds.;34.8296;-86.7453999999999
