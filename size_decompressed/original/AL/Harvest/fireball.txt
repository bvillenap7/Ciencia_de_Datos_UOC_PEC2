Bright green multi-point fireball falling out of sky.;2013-08-04 20:10:00;4 seconds;Bright green multi-point fireball falling out of sky. Saw an object that appeared fairly large for the distance come burning out of the sky with multiple points of light on fire white hot with green glows around each point bright green glow and then a long trail of white particles following it was clearly burning up whatever it was maybe it was splitting apart when it was entering the atmosphere not sure but it was very visible and large.  It made no sound.  Wife was standing next to me and I called it out and she confirmed exactly what i saw.. We are just outside of Huntsville, Alabama in Harvest Alabama out in the country.  There is a military base here in Huntsville as well but it was no where near the base and we were actually looking in the opposite direction northwest towards Tennessee.;34.8296;-86.7453999999999
