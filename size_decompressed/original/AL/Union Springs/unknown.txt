My wife and I live in a very rural community.  We were almost home, when we saw two blinking lights.  My first initial thoughts was it was a helicopter hovering perpendicular to us, but then as we slowed down the lights moved to different altitudes, but now moving away from us as the same speed.  As we followed, they began to pick speed, so did we. Faster and faster I drove but right before a big clearing they rose up and over a treeline just in time for us to lose them.  I could have put it off as something from the military, but here are the questions that keep me wandering?  They never made a sound.  The distance between the treeline and them seemed like they went through the trees not over. The speed they accelerated at seemed too incredible.  They moved like they had complete control of the environment around them.  It felt like we were chasing ghost.  And they knew exactly when to disappear to avoid a very revealing position.;32.1484;-85.7264
