He laughed and said it was a plane, but it was very, super bright.  Instead of coming closer, as it was so bright, it stay bright, but was sinking straight down. It kept going down, very slowing. Straight down, untill it sank behind a hill top.  The other side of the hill would be toward Scottsboro, AL. North of Scottsboro.
