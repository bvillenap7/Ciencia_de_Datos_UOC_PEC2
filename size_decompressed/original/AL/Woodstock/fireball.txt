AL Bright Green Flash in sky, then it shot out of sight like a rocket, I pulled off the road along with another person that was driving in the North bound lane, he asked me WTH was that.  I told him IDK.  But it’s not anything normal, it happened right over the Green Pond Fire Dept building, that’s we’re we pulled off road at.  Maybe they have cameras, it happened to quick for me to do anything.;33.2101;-87.1528
