Light was the size of a star and would remain unseen until flash occured.  It was flashing at rate of 1 flash in 60 to 90 seconds. First flash I saw was at about the magnitude of Sirius and diminished in magnitude only slightly. It stayed in Lepus and did not move. At one time it moved south about one inch in relation to the backgound stars and stayed there untill I lost it on the horizen.  About Six people saw this and most of us fly aircraft.  I am a amature astronamer and I dont know what it was that I saw. In 12 years of looking at the heavens I have never seen anything like this.;31.356;-85.3342
