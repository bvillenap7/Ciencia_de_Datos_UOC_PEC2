Four  balls of light spotted over Spanish Fort area.;2009-08-23 01:00:00;1 hour;Four  balls of light spotted over Spanish Fort area. It was about 1 am Sunday August 23rd 2009.  My husband and I went to go have a cigarette before we went to bed.   When we went outside to the back yard we instantly noticed this huge blinking light.  It looked to be over HWY 31 about 3 miles from our house.  I instantly thought of an airplane.  Then my husband brought to my attention that planes only flash red and green lights.  This object was flashing red, green, blue and orange lights.  Not just dull versions of those colors but the most beautiful vibrant version that you can ever imagine.  Also it wasn’t moving except for the occasional sway from side to side. I had never in my life been in such a state of awe.  My husband ran and got our camera and binoculars.  Of course my camera wouldn’t catch the object but when we looked through the binoculars you could see clearly that it was the most perfect circle ball shape ever.  It stayed hovering in the same spot for the hour that we stayed out there watchi! ng it. At one point during the hour, 3 smaller versions of the light circle also producing the same vibrant color flashes came to the left side of the larger color circle and disappeared.   I wrote into the local news on Monday asking if there was any other sightings that night and I have yet to get a response.   I was reading where in the neighboring city of Daphne in 2008 someone reported that they saw a hovering circle flashing the same colors that we saw!   This was no airplane, helicopter, weather balloon, or new military aircraft.;30.6949190476191;-87.8881523809524
