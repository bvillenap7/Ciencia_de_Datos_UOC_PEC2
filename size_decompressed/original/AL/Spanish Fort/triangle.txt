I heard a very loud and deep sounding noise overhead, as I was doing some last minute lock up before bedtime.   I ran to where the noise was coming from and saw three bright lights.  They did not appear to look like any aircraft I had seen, nor did they sound like any I heard before.  The walls in my home had shook and I thought maybe a plane was crashing, but the three lights just kept moving on.   The object looked dark against the full moon, just east of it.   My husband said that it may have been military aircraft, but, the sound was not that of jets or a propeller plane.  My next door neighbor also ran outside to check on it.  It took all of three minutes and the event was over .;30.6949190476191;-87.8881523809524
