It moves multiple times, then rockets off through the earth's atmosphere I was sitting, smoking in my garage when I noticed two stars. This was interesting to me because the placement of the stars in the treetops resembled the eyes of the sloth from the cartoon ice age. I laughed to myself until the stars began to move from their positions. At this point,  I played my head back against my chair to gauge whether what I was seeing was seemingly moving due to my head not remaining still. The left star vanished in the treetops. The right star began to change from one solid point of light into three, in a triangle formation.  At this point,  the lights began to grow closer. There were three lights in a triangle formation but one light, the one pointing at me, grew brighter.  It shifted throughout the treetops several times. It grew brighter and seemed to be getting a closer perspective each time it moved. At this point,  I had no idea what I was witnessing.  I thought ufo and I thought American military. It shifted from on! e point in the treetops to another. I could not comprehend what I was witnessing, so I laughed, waved and gave a middle finger to it. It refocused through the treetops twice. Each time it seemed to focus on me I smiled and laughed at it. My mind could not comprehend.  The triangular shape then appeared to rotate opposite to me and to my astonishment there appeared to be engines of some type, burn and begin to rise vertically and subsequently began to arc as if it were following the earth's atmosphere.  It continued to rise vertically and at this point,  I sat up in my chair in order to follow the arc. It continued until it was out of sight. I can in no way comprehend what I witnessed.;30.6949190476191;-87.8881523809524
