Red diamond shaped craft, yellow light in the middle.;2012-04-10 20:00:00;about 2 min;Red diamond shaped craft, yellow light in the middle. My friend and I left my house to take a walk around 8 pm. About 10 min into our walk, we reached a street that allowed us to look over the treeline.  I looked to my right when I saw a large, diamond-shaped object ascending from the horizon in the west.  It was red with a yellow light in the middle of it, at first it looked like a ball of fire. It was blurry, but definitely a diamond shape.  It slowly ascended above the trees, then began to come our way.  This craft didn't make any noise what so ever.  When it was directly over us, it was only about 1000 ft in the air. Although it was close to us it was still blurry as if it had an aura around it.  After it passed over us going toward the east, it quickly ascended further into the sky.  As we watched it disappear, it twinkled like a star then it was gone.;30.6949190476191;-87.8881523809524
Red diamond object in alabama;2012-04-10 20:10:00;2 min;Red diamond object in alabama I was outside in my neighborhood around 8:10 pm , when i noticed a red blur rising from the west behind pine trees. The area it came from was empty forest about 2 miles west of my house. The object looked like a firework at first, it was rising slowly and was at about 1000 ft above my friend and I when it passed over and started to move swiftly over us towards the east.  As it passed over we noticed it was much bigger than we first thought.  The object was a red diamond with a blurry aura and a yellow light in the center, it was covering vast ground at a fast pace without making any noise, it was amazing how silent the object was.  As the object passed east it was ascending to incredible heights at a fast pace, until the object went straight up .  Before it disappeared i saw it twinkle like that of star.;30.6949190476191;-87.8881523809524
