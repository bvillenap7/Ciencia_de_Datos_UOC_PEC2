Two bright white clyinders flying in formation, faded away.;2013-03-29 10:35:00;4 minutes;Two bright white clyinders flying in formation, faded away. On the morning of March 29, 2013 from 10:35 AM CDT until 10:39 CDT I observed two white cylindrically shaped objects fly from north to south, making a broad sweeping turn to the west. They stayed in view, ascending slightly until they finally just faded out. The event was observed from my automobile as I was driving to work,  between Kellyton, AL, and Goodwater, AL on US Highway 280, about 10 miles west of Alexander City, AL. I was able to keep the objects in view for four minutes. The day was clear, with scattered high cloud. I was driving in a northwesterly direction, and the objects appeared at my 2:00 position moving north to south. They were are very bright white, and were cylinder shaped. There were no wings or other control surfaces I could see.  They did not have the silhouette of rotary winged aircraft, appearing to be long and slender, rod like in their appearance. They were making a broad westerly turn, and ascending very slightly. Their position to each other remained constant, one was slightly above and behind the other, as shown below:  _________________________  _________________________  I observed them almost continually for four minutes I was driving and did have to be aware of road conditions.  They finally just faded out, for lack of a better term at about my 10:00 position. I grew up near and live Fort Benning, GA, and am familiar with most contemporary aircraft and helicopters.  That’s not what these were.  I also moved my head around as much as I could, to make sure they weren’t reflections in my car’s windshield.  They weren’t. They appeared to be close, I would say two miles or under, and were under 5000 feet  altitude. I have good vision, and as a result of my job I am a trained observer. What struck me was the fairly slow speed, and brilliant whiteness of these objects, and the fact they faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally good witness.  He holds a very responsible job, and he reports that he has good vision.
