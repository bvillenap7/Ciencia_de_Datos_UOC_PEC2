Triangular light-formation over forest near Jackson, AL around midnight.;2007-09-14 23:23:00;App. 30 seconds;Triangular light-formation over forest near Jackson, AL, around midnight. I was looking out my window, toward the woods, and just above the tree-line appeared a triangular formation of lights slowly drifting across the night sky.  Most closely resembled an equilateral triangle.  I couldn't see the actual outline of the object- only the lights that formed the shape.  Three small white lights formed each corner of the triangle, with the tip clearly pointed in the direction of movement.  One large blue light, softly blinking on and off, was in the center of the triangle. The object came up over the tree-line at approximately a 45-degree angle, continued in this direction for several seconds, then suddenly reversed its course in a strange motion, like a rotation, and came back down in another 45-degree angle, until it disappeared behind the trees and could no longer be seen.  The entire path it traveled seemed to the upper part of a triangle.  It was the only time I ever saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.
