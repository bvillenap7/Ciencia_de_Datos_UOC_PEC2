My 4 friends and I were standing outside at approximately 9.00 central time on july 14, 2008, beside my truck.   Friend #1 saw it first to the south traveling north straight toward us.  It appeared to be a white orb with red and blue streams of light orbiting all around it and it was moving along the treeline faster than anything Ive ever seen.   My brother recorded it on his cell phone and when we watched the playback, there was no red or blue lights, only the white orb moving in random directions so fast that it appeared to be moving in a smooth flowing manner to the naked eye.  After about five minutes, it jumped to the left and then to the right as it disappeared traveling west.   We saw 30 -35 aircraft traveling all over the sky til around 10.00p.m. central.;34.6748311111111;-86.0942844444445
