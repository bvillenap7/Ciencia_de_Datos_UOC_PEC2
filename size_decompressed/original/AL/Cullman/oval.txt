UFO Sighting?;2003-06-01 22:30:00;5 minutes;UFO Sighting? I saw a yellowish green oval shaped object with red and white lights surrounding the outside of the object.  The object appeared to be bigger than a full moon and was moving in a south direction.  The object seemed to be brightly lit up. My dad told me to run get the video camera and I did, and we got the object on our video camera.  I ran and got the car and my mother and I tried to follow it so we could get more video, but we were unsuccessful.  It was moving to quickly for us to film it, but we could see it in the distance very briefly. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports of the same event, submitted by different family members.  They are investigating locally to establish whether the object might have been an illuminated blimp.  PD));34.1751352409644;-86.8300704819273
