We saw a large green fireball streak across the night sky and it traveled from east to west. It was very fast and very brightly lit. Whe observed the fireball for about a minute and then suddenly to our amazement, it exploded and formed into 3 white disk shaped craft. Then they just disappeared! We cannot believe what we just saw. This is the first time that I have seen a fireball in the night sky but my other friends have seen them before at another time.;34.1751352409644;-86.8300704819273
