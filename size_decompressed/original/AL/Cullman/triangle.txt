Me and my friends were in the front yard when this happened and it was early in the afternoon. I could feel as if whoever was in the craft was watching us. The object was large and quite frankly, VERY damned strange! It then travelled very, very slowly across a large cattle area that isn't too far from my house. The cattle were acting up and making noise as if something was bothering them. Then the craft stopped above the heard of cattle and turned and then it made a low deep humming noise. Then all of a sudden it just took off very fast to the west at a break neck speed! My friend Jason says that he saw something similar a week ago. It might be connected. I don't know what in the hell it was but I don't think it was from around here. We're not alone Peter!;34.1751352409644;-86.8300704819273
