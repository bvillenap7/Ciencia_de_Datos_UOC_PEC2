There are 4 circle-shaped lights in the sky, which keep circling and rotating.  They a kind of blue in color.  First, they bunch up together, and then they separate from each other.    Afterwards they rotate and then bunch up again not quite sure what it is, other than lights moving in a continuous circle as described above. ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights?
