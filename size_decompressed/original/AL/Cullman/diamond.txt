orange fireball in cull. al.;2003-01-10 22:00:00;10 minutes;orange fireball in cull. al. my wife had just let the dog out and was watching from the living room windows. she said come LOOK at this! i thought she probably saw a jet with its landing lights on.what i beheld was a huge glowing orange plasma?/fire?ball in the sky to the south-probably about a few miles away.the sky was crystal clear and no moon. the object had a trail of plasma coming up off of it and coming down below it (very thin)giving it a shape like a bulbous icesicle.it continued straight toward our house--due north,as it did the plasma faded slowly and revealed either a diamond shaped or triangular shaped aircraft with a row of greenish lights all the way across the bottom. it also had blinking lights on the wingtips.there was NO sound associated with its passing!it was flying around medium altitude-we listened for about 10 minutes after its passing!;34.1751352409644;-86.8300704819273
9 colorful UFO witness slow moving over Cullman, Alabama.;2013-03-09 21:00:00;3 minutes;9 colorful UFO witness slow moving over Cullman, Alabama UFO’s sighted over Cullman Alabama.  Saturday night at approx. 9:30 PM I stepped out of my front door to walk up to the corner store to get a drink.  I live about a block off of  278 highway in Cullman.   To my amazement there was colored lights in the air    following the path of 278  .  The first formation was a group of five which was scattered out and then they changed formation to two front lead craft with the other three making a then forming a straight line behind them.  They looked like upside down diamond shapes with the bottom of the craft being the darker part with the light becoming brighter and more translucent as it got to the  oval top of the craft. Each one was a different color, there was  reds, greens, blues, gold’s, purple.  All were glowing lights.  It was like watching a Christmas parade in the sky. Then right behind them was a formation of three more and then right behind them was one lone  last craft.  I was jumping up and down when this one came by yelling come see me land here, and it slowed down and stalled for a moment then went by.  They were probably  saying look at that crazy human.  But I really want to meet them in a conscious state. I  have  so many questions.   Not a whisper of a sound came from them,  I was very close to their  path, at the altitude they were at and as clear as I could see them they had to each have been about 50 to 60 feet in diameter . You could tell that they were intelligently controlled  as you watched them change directions.  The were not moving very fast possibly about 40 mph.  It was slow enough that I got a really good look at them. Just past where I live they all took a sharp 90 ° turn north and then went invisible.;34.1751352409644;-86.8300704819273
