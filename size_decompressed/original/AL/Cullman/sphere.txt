These objects were very similar to the UFO's spotted over Manhattan several days ago. They were about the same height away and lasted about as long.  First one, then three, then five, then nine and more showed up.  They moved over the concert area (YouthQuake) where I was at at the moment. About five minutes later, a military jet was flying over the same area, but the UFO's were already gone.   They were spheres that were a silver color.   We are all under 30, and sensible people, we weren't under any influence, and it was clear as day outside, no clouds.;34.1751352409644;-86.8300704819273
