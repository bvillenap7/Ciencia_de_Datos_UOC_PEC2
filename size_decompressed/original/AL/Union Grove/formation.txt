UFOs observed by WWII veteran and multiple Army and National Guard members.;1972-06-15 20:30:00;2 hours;UFOs observed by WWII veteran and multiple Army and National Guard members. It was fairly well-known at this time and in this area, that on many nights one could go outdoors and watch UFOs move in a variety of formations.  The light of each craft would vary from nearly invisible to extremely bright.  The objects were obviously many miles away, most estimates are that the objects had to have been in Huntsville and very likely above the Redstone Arsenal. Entire families and friends would gather on the back porch to watch the UFOs move in wildly varying formations if that term fits.  They would move up and down, circle one another, zoom back and forth, and generally each sighting event ended with the lights either disappearing or zooming directly up and out of the atmosphere. The individuals who observed the UFOs varied from a preacher, to housewives, to a retired WWII-Korea-Vietnam combat veteran (101st Airborne, winner of the Silver Star, etc.), and several then-enlisted Army and National Guard members.  These individuals were all very serious people who did not care for watching science fiction films, reading about UFOs, or even speculating about life on other planets.  These individuals would all be willing to testify under oath that what they observed were NOT airplanes nor any other form of then-known/conventional aircraft.
