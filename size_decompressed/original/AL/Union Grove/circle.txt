It was dark and 8:40 pm as I sat out on my back deck in Union Grove, Alabama looking out North East across the country side when over the trees about 300 yards out and at maybe twice the trees high, appeared a white glowing ball shaped object.  The frogs down by the pond stopped croaking which was very strange.  It was about the size of a golf ball held at arms length.  It was moving slowly to the South West.  After about 8 seconds it disappeared only to reappear to my far right (SW) a second later.  Then it took off straight up into the sky at a high rate of speed.  After a few minutes some kind of aircraft with unidentifiable lights were seen in the same place this ball of light had appeared and heading on the same path the object went. No sound was heard.;34.4107;-86.4596
