I went walking, I always did around 9pm bc that's when the sun would go down and it would cool off.  I looked in the sky behind Curtiston- not sure of the spelling- Primary School and saw a shape moving over some trees and saw the wind blowing but heard nothing. I jogged down the street beside this school and looked into a field and it was much lower to the ground and looked to be lifting off. It was floating. No sound and no wind now. It was Black, no lights, looked solid- I didn't see any windows or lights or anything-, and was a perfect triangle. I tried to spot it again, but it was gone.
