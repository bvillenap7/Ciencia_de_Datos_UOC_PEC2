A large chef's hat shaped object in sky over US231 South.;2009-10-15 18:00:00;30 seconds;A large chef's hat shaped object in sky over US231 South. My parents and I were driving home one night a few days before I got married and we were taking the back roads home. I was sitting in the backseat and was on the phone with one of my friends. My dad was passing over a railroad crossing and I looked up as we rocked across the tracks when I saw this massive object in the sky. The only way that I can describe this object was that it was in a shape of a chef's hat. It did not look like a weather balloon, I have seen these all my life and it was 5 or 6 times larger than any other balloon I have seen. It seemed to be a metal, but not a shiny metal. The only light coming from the object was out of the bottom of the tube of the chef's hat. It was illuminated as if there were spotlights from the ground illuminating the bottom portion of the object. I took a second to study it, and then I looked at my parents just long enough to say what is that? and then I looked up in the sky and it was gone. There was one small! cloud in the sky, but no way that the object could be hidden by this smaller cloud. I just want to know if I am the only person that saw this. It was huge, I just don't understand, I haven't stopped thinking about it for the past year and want some answers.;31.4358;-85.643
