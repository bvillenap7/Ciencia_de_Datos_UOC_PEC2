ETV's (Extra Terrestrial Vehicle) sighting;2000-09-15 21:00:00;15 seconds;ETV's (Extra Terrestrial Vehicle) sighting my wife and i were laying on lawn chairs outside after dark...it was a clear night...looking straight up, i saw what i thought was a plane, and my wife watched it with me...it was a white light moving like a plane high in the sky...suddenly and magnificently, it did a perfect quarter-circle maneuver, paused for perhaps a half second and then shot across the sky in less than a second...perhaps a hundreth of a second (there was no exceleration, this was instantaneous speed)...the craft was certainly being flown and maneuvered by an intelligence...and was truly an ETV (Extra Terrestrial Vehicle)...the perfect quarter circle turn, and the abrupt split second trip across the night sky could not have been anything of a natural cause...it just looked like a plane in the night sky at an average speed, until the craft was maneuvered by this unknown intelligence to make a quarter-circle turn, and then this unknown intelligence did something to make the craft shoot across the sky...until that night, my wife did not believe in UFO'S (ETV's)...that was truly an extraordinary experience...i dont care what anyone else beleives...I KNOW ETV's ARE REAL, AND THEY ARE HERE...my guess is they have been watching and observing this planet perhaps for millions of years.
