Someone noticed 2 different shaped objects in the sky.It was very dark,for it is in the country.Then we noticed a third object. They werent moving fast.No colored lights, just 3 big lights.  As we were all watching, there were 3 large flashes, and the objects were gone. The flashes were huge,like a super large flash bulb from a super large camera. Looking right at it,actually made me see spots after the flashes. The way the objects dissapeared,I knew was not something ever seen befour. There were 10 of us there,and we were speechless.;31.4358;-85.643
It looked like a plane moving slowly in the sky, until the light began the get smaller and smaller then it was completely gone!;2016-12-15 05:37:00;20 seconds;It looked like a plane moving slowly in the sky, until the light began the get smaller and smaller then it was completely gone! Outside talking to a friend, looking up at the sky watching for helicopter I had heard.  Then I saw what at first I thought was an airplane/airline jet, but was constantly questioning the altitude, looked high.  It was moving about jet speed, but only had a bright light.  Sorta resembled a small star, as I was watching it makes its way across the sky in a straight line, it suddenly started getting smaller.  That is when I noticed it was getting smaller because it was leaving, literally.  Reminded me of a light disappearing at the end of the tunnel and being gone.  I was telling him how I was in complete disbelief about it, but it did happen.;31.4358;-85.643
