It was like something out of star wars;1975-10-15 23:00:00;15 minutes;It was like something out of star wars I was watching out the window for my husband to come home.Looking westward I saw a large white light sitting pretty low in the sky.The light was moving upward and it  was getting closer.I stepped out on my porch and watched as it went directly over my home.I could see it very well because it was a clear night.It was at least the size of a football field and grey mettalic with white and red recessed lights all around the edge. The large white light was in the center,on the bottom,protruding out slightly,which has always made me think I saw it taking off from the wooded area that was in the direction it came from.It made no sound and seemed to be gliding slowly.I watched till it went out of sight.I was a young mother,sober and not on drugs but no one believed me, not even my husband. I feel honored to have witnessed it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.2654;-85.8655
Huge Triangular Craft;1987-07-15 22:30:00;10 minutes;Huge Triangular Craft In August of 1987 I was walking my dogs down a service road that runs parallel highway 59 near Collinsville Alabama. The service road runs along the base of a ridgeline that extends west of Lookout Mtn.   The Triangular craft appeared from the east coming over the ridgeline. It blocked out the entire night sky (clear night) above my head and I would guess was flying at somewhere between 700-1000 ft. It had 3 lights, one at each corner in Green, Red and White.  It made no sound, basically hovering above the ridge for at least 3-5 minutes. It then banked slightly, turned due west and slowly made its way towards Hunstville. I watched it for at 10 minutes. I didn't know what to think, it was too weird to deal with locally so I kept it to myself. I did note that the direction it went off in houses the Military's Redstone Arsenal.;34.2654;-85.8655
