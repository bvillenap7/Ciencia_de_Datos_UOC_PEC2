The light was constant from sky to the tree line where the object started to curve back to the sky at about a 30 degree angle.  The object disappear from sight behind the trees.   The object was so hot that a blue streak in the air.  The light was left for some time after the object disappeared from view.  It may have just been a meteor but it was unlike any I have ever seen.  It was such a pretty color, the dark sky looked almost dusk from the intense light.  I left for work and looked for an in pact sight but nothing was found.  The area I live in is far from city light pollution and full of stars.  I can see satellites pass in the winter months. I was hoping to find someone else that had saw the same phenomenon.  I have been out with the telescope all night looking.  Any info would be helpful.  So so so cool!!!  No Google video or utube video look anywhere near this object.;34.0821;-87.0484
