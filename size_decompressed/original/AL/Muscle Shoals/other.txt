Man, lying on back looking up, sees tiny bright white speck streak across blue sky from W to E.  Obj. zigzagged twice, disappeared;1996-04-02 13:00:00;4 seconds;The caller was lying on his back, resting in his back yard, staring up at a very bright, clear sky.  Suddenly, he noticed a very bright, tiny white speck moving across the sky at a very high rate of speed, and it appeared to be very high.  At first, he thought it might be a (daytime) meteor, but it was distinctly white against a blue sky.  The object traveled from directly overhead to the horizon, traveling west to east, in approximately 3-4 seconds.  Its angular velocity was much higher than the space shuttle when it returns from orbit, which the caller had seen on many occasions. The object traveled across the sky at a seemingly constant rate, although it changed direction suddenly on at least two occasions toward the end of the observation, when it was close to the horizon. He had another sighting together with five carloads of young people in 1976.  It was a huge object, and very close to the ground, he thought.;34.7561;-87.6304
