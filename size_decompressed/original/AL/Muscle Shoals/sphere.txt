3 glowing red lights in a line.;2011-07-17 21:50:00;Unknown;3 glowing red lights in a line. 3 spherical objects, each glowing red and amber, were observed flying in a line from east to west.  The front two were closer together with the third trailing behind about twice the distance between the first two.  I was unable to judge altitude or size of the objects.  There is an airport very close to where I made the observation, however none of the objects had flashing lights like the personal aircraft that frequent that airport.   There was however an airplane circling the area at the time.;34.7561;-87.6304
