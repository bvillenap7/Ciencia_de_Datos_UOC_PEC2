Dual metallic cylinder craft with no sound.;2014-04-03 14:00:00;2 minutes;Dual metallic cylinder craft with no sound. Was looking inside my work truck, when a reflection on the window caught my attention.  I looked up and saw two large cylinder objects that we're connected in the middle flying above me.  They were so bright I had to put my hand above my eyes and squint to see the craft good.   There was no sound and it disappeared from view in a fraction of a second.  It was a clear day with very few clouds.   Never seen anything like it and can't find anything on the internet that looks quite like it.  I have no clue as to what it was.
