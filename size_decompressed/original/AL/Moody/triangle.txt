Triangle UFO in early 90's chased by helicopters.;1992-09-01 20:00:00;1 minute;Triangle UFO in early 90's chased by helicopters.  In early 90's couple of friends and me were playing outside at night in moody alabama when we heard a noise. Looked to our right and out behind trees came a triangle shaped UFO with different colored lights flashing around it, red orange blue etc. Two helicopters were chasing it and were right on its tail. We ran in and told our parents. Later on friends and I lost touch. Have wondered past 20 plus years if what I remember was real or just a dream. Have searched internet for years but found no description similar to what I saw. Until now. Found on this site someone describing same experience close to same town, early 90's, helicopters chasing it, different colored lights and all. I finally feel some vindication.;33.6035;-86.4668000000001
