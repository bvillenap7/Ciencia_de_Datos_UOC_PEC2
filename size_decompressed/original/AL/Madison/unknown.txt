Green light in the sky around Madison, AL area Nov. 28th 2006;2006-11-28 18:00:00;about 5 seconds;Green light in the sky around Madison, AL area Nov. 28th 2006 On November 28th, 2007 around the time of 6:00pm central (not sure of the approximant time)  My family (Dad, step-Mom, and I) saw a green light shooting through the sky.  We were driving NE towards Huntsville, AL.  It was going the same direction to the left of us along interstate 565.   There were really low clouds that night and the object came down from the clouds, flew about 5 seconds, and went back up.  I’ve never seen anything fly this fast in my life.  I couldn’t get a really good look at the shape, but it was glowing green.  It did not have a green streak behind it either.   It was flying too low to be a meteor or “space junk” as it was reported here in the Decatur Daily.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
