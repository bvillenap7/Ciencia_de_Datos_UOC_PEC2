It was a very bright cool clear night in march. I was standing on the north side of the home I was living in at that time. The front of my home faceies the west and sits just to the east of the aircrafe approch to the Huntsville internation airport. I see small to very larg air craff daily. I had step out on the front porch for a smoke  and decided to stept in to the shadows on the norht side of the house to releave my self. As I stood there, facing north looking stright up in the night sky, a full moon with what seam to be a thin clod cover apeard just 15 deg. (approxaly) to the right of were I was looking.For the first few secands (1 or 2 maybe 3) I did not realize that the moon was to for north form were it normal path is. Then I notice also how fast it was travling for east to west. It took a approxaly 15 to 20 secands to go from 15 degs to my right to 15 degs to my left. Then it disapered completly. I told my wife of what I had seen and one or two others. I supose it may have be a reflexion, but who knows what it was? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We agree with the witness that the Moon should not appear in the northern sky, when viewed by a person in the Earth's northern hemisphere.  PD));34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
Small , violet-blue, quiet u.f.o. moves and hovers around grocery store parking lot in Madison, Alabama.;2007-12-11 21:00:00;9 minutes;Small , violet-blue, quiet u.f.o. moves and hovers around grocery store parking lot in Madison, Alabama. I noticed a small violet-blue light slowly moving above the parking lot of Kroger's grocery where I was standing. It quietly and playfully moved around the perimeter of the parking lot and store with intervals of hovering. All of this was at very low altitude although it did change that as well. At onr point, it was not that much higher than the store. It looked round shaped to me with the violet-blue light outlining the roundness with 4 smaller circles on the the bottom of it. When it moved around, it tilted some making it look more like a slender disk. I am not sure how long this had been going on before I arrived but people were standing in the parking lot looking up in amazement. One guy was filming it. It was around nine at night when I saw it and, just before 10 minutes had gone by, it all of the sudden tilted and took a sharp abrupt dive behind the store which would be a field. A few of us, myself included, looked behind the store and it was just dark. There was never at anytime a sound.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
