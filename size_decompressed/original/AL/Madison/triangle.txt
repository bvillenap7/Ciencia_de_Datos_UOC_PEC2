Two Triangular Craft over Madison Alabama;2007-02-28 20:00:00;12 minutes;Two Triangular Craft over Madison Alabama Around 8:00p.m. I was driving home heading east on hwy 72 in Madison, Alabama. As I drove toward Wall Triana Hwy I noticed two bright lights above a field that was located next to a Grocery Store.  Normally I wouldn’t have paid any attention, except there were no flashing lights and they were very low to the ground I’d say close to three hundred feet off the ground.   They were very still and seemed to be motionless. I decided to pull into the parking lot of the grocery store so I could get a better view.  I pulled to the side where the field was and sat facing the field so I could observe this.  The whole time I was speaking on the phone to my boyfriend.  When I finally parked the car I could see that these were not just two big lights rather they were a multitude of lights arranged in a triangular shape. I rolled down my window and the only sound was that from the hwy behind me, no noise as that of a plane could be heard. The first craft began to move south at a slow pace. I’d say at a maximum speed of 10mph. Then a moment later the second craft followed. The first craft had a row of four white lights, then a row of three, the middle light on this row was red. Then a row of two lights and one light to complete a triangle. The red light in the center of the craft was blinking, but all other white lights remained solid and consistent. The second craft was exactly the same as the first one, however it lacked the red light, only white lights in the shape of a triangle. As the crafts moved over head you could make out a faint shape around the triangle, the only way you could even notice was that it would block out stars as it moved even though the triangle part wasn’t over the star yet. Both craft continued at this slow pace until I could not see them from the front anymore and then they became invisible in the night sky. I didn’t have anyone else in the car, nor did I have a camera. Believe me I wish I had both! Where I live is close to Red Stone Arsenal (military base) and Huntsville used to be headquarters for NASA. So I can’t say that it wasn’t a military plane, but it sure wasn’t a plane as we know it today. Either way UFO or secret plane I have never seen anything like it in my life!;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
Triangle shaped craft with orange-yellow lights that hovered very low near Redstone Arsenal in Madison, Al;2010-01-02 21:10:00;2 minutes;Triangle shaped craft with orange-yellow lights that hovered very low near Redstone Arsenal in Madison, Al Triangular shaped craft with orange-yellow lights hovering very low about 5 miles from Redstone Arsenal in Madison, Al.  We turned the car around to take a picture and craft vanished.  We could not see it anywhere.  My husband and I both saw it, and asked each other, What is that?   It was almost right over our car and very low.  It did not appear to be moving.  We pulled onto the next side road to stop and get a picture and could not see it anymore.   This was about a half mile from our home and very close to the arsenal in Madison, AL.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
3 bright orange lights along side a bright white light.;2014-01-20 19:30:00;1 minute;3 bright orange lights along side a bright white light We were driving down Sullivan Street towards Wall Triana when I suddenly noticed 3 very bright orange lights.  They were in a triangle formation.  There was another light that was out to the side a short distance from the triangle.  It was bright white and gone almost as fast as we saw it.  The white light and one of the orange lights disappeared as quick as if someone turned off a light switch.  The second lightt slowly faded away as did the third light about 10 seconds after the second.  My fiance tried to take a picture but his camera wouldnt focus for some reason...which is odd because he has a very nice camera on his phone.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
Quiet Triangular overall shape with 4 dark amber lights (possible windows);2019-12-25 17:40:00;2 minutes;Quiet Triangular overall shape with 4 dark amber lights (possible windows) On the eveing of 12/25/2019 while at work (nurse) in Madison Alabama, I stepped outside the facility to call my wife at approx 7:40 pm,  and noticed when I stepped outside, what at appeared to be a large aircraft (ascending up) from approx 500+ feet over tree tops and Hwy 72, to the side of the facility where I was located..  Initially there were 2 large amber lights (possibly windows), these 2 points of light were approx 500+ feet apart, followed by a second amber light(again possible window) following at approx 750+ feet, then followed by another (4th amber light, trailing at another 800 to 1000 feet.  When I first seen it, I told my wife on the phone immediately, let me call you back!  I began trying to flip on the camera on the cell phone and it unfortunately was showing me on the camera, instead of the outward photo image, I finally got the phone camera to work, so that I could video the image before me… This object was massively large, moved effortlessl! y and slowly, was dead quiet, made 0 sounds, again had ONLY of 4(overall) dark amber lights (window appearance). The object was traveling in a North heading, then turned to it's left, heading then NW, towards the city of Athens, which at this time, is my beginning video of the 2 lights moving away from the camera.  As  the camera pans down, you'll see a single amber light moving from left to right slowly...This is the fourth amber light mentioned initially and trails off, continuing in a northern direction projectory.  As I am quite familiar with the Phoenix Lights Incident of 1997, and it's details, I truly believe my sighting was a Triangle, with very much the same details, much like that one and knew IT, when I SAW it, and I know my mouth fell open.... This was a humbling experience and an amazing craft! Folks, hate to tell you this...WERE NOT ALONE!;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531

At first I noticed the lights and thought it was from a water tower or something similar such as an antenna.  As I got closer passing the Publix shopping center, the lights began to move in such a way that indicated the lights were rotating.  I then turned into the parking lot close to the Redstone FCU and immediately turned around to try to catch it on camera.  The craft was triangle in shape based on the 3 white lights on the corners.  There was also a red light, which appeared to be on the bottom.  It sped off and I could not catch up to it.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
