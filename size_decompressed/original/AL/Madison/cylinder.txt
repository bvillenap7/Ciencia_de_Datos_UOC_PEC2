UFO sighting, Madison, AL Friday 4 October 2013;2013-10-04 21:55:00;5 minutes;UFO sighting, Madison, AL, Friday 4 October 2013 My daughter called me from a separate location from where my wife and I were located and reported lights in the sky.  She was with her friend and friends family a few miles north from our location.  Our address is Amsterdam Pl, Madison, AL.  Number of witnesses at the other location were around 4.  They witnessed approx. 30 lights in the sky.  The location of the UFOs were North to North West of our location.  The angle of the objects were moving right to left from the horizon (north to north west in straight movement upward).  No erratic movement was witnessed.  The lights were red to orange and in a circular pattern.   The lights finally moved, what appeared to be out of the atmosphere.  At the same time of the sighting a plane was coming in to land at Huntsville Intl airport, from the North.  The airport is situated to the south of our location.  I do have cell phone recording of the event.   At first my phone would not allow a recording, which is very strange, as my phone usually always allows the recording selection.   Finally, my phone allowed some coverage to be recorded. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded quite credible to us.  He is former military, and has considerable experience with flying military aircraft.  We suspect that he is an exceptionally capable witness.  PD));34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
