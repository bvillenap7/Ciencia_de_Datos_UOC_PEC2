Rectangular very bright and big green object seen over Madison, Alabama;2019-06-15 21:11:00;~6 minutes;Rectangular very bright and big green object seen over Madison, Alabama On the night of June 15, 2019, I went to my backyard and walk to the middle and something like a very far, distant noise made me to turn my head to the sky, completely over my head. As I was looking, I realize it was a very bright and intense green light coming from an big object or whatever it was.  I looked at intervals during 1 or 2 minutes, and then suddenly, I understood that something was not right, because it was big, kind of square and it didn’t move. So I continued looking, went inside, came back, and it was still there, just over me.  I went inside again and thought that I should take a picture, but I didn’t want to leave it alone and loose it maybe.  So I came back again to the backyard and it was still there, not moving.  I could feel some kind of energy. This time I went inside and grabbed my iPhone, and I focused over my head looking directly to the “object”.  In the instant I took the picture the “big object” moved in a fraction of second to the right and just disappeared.
