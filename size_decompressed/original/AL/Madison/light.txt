Light over the horizon dropping suddenly to no where;2002-11-26 22:10:00;5 seconds;Light over the horizon dropping suddenly to no where We were driving down Hughes Rd. when I saw a huge light hovering over the horizon for a good five seconds in the sky. We thought it was a stop light, but it dropped suddenly so we knew it was something else. Then we realized it was a UFO. We stopped the car to get out and look around, but nothing seemed diferent. It was as if nothing had happened and we were the only witnesses.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
Star like ufo decends down slowly from high in the sky until it gets about tree top level.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus sighting.  PD));2007-04-12 21:00:00;2 hours;Star like ufo decends down slowly from high in the sky until it gets about tree top level. I have been watching this star like ufo every night just after sunset, for the past four months. It desends down slowly from high in the sky. As it comes closer its lights get brighter. It will sit still for a while, then slowly move down more and more in a zig-zag movement. It will come down to tree top level, sometimes lower. We live a half a mile from airport, airplanes come in for a landing and go right past this ufo, they have to see this bright light. I watch this for 2 hours or more every night, with the exception of when thunderstorms or in the area. My daughter has also watched this with me. It has also dimmed or faded its lights and it would be invisible. I now know for sure that ufo,s really are out there, and its amazing and exciting to be able to watch this night after night.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531

This is my second report ,Im still watching this bright star like ufo, slowly come down from high in the sky to below tree level, and slowly move toward palmer Rd. There is also another ufo that stays high in the sky until about 10:45pm. Then in makes its slow desent down. I have also seen orbs flying right above the trees, with blinking lights. I know that military planes have been checking out this bright light. Im sure they had to be taking pictures of this ufo. Please let me know anything you find out about this sighting. I sent my last report on the 14th or 15th of April.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
Object darted across the sky and would stop on a dime and dart in another direction;2011-07-04 21:30:00;1 Hour +;Object darted across the sky and would stop on a dime and dart in another direction On July 4th, ~9:30 pm, while watching a fireworks show in Madison,  Alabama, my sister, my mother, I myself along with a few other people all noticed a moving object in the sky.  It appeared to look like any other star in the sky, but this object darted, danced, and even went in circles. I am not aware of any aircraft that could make such movements in the sky as this object did.    We watched this object dart back and forth across the sky for over an hour.   It was still darting and zig zagging around when I left to go home so for how long this object actually appeared I really do not know.  I have never witnessed anything like this before.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
Several bright  white & one red lights moving quickly over the Madison/Huntsville/Owens Cross Road area 1 light not a plane.;2012-02-09 20:00:00;3 minutes;Several bright  white & one red lights moving quickly over the Madison/Huntsville/Owens Cross Road area 1 light not a plane. I went outside to have a cigarette and looked up noticing what I thought was a plane coming into land at Huntsville Airport.  I live approximately 2 miles from the airport.  It was a very bright white light moving fairly fast.  It kind of looked like the same light when the space station passed over the area a few weeks ago.   But there was what appeared to be a plane following very close behind as if it were being pulled in a direct path by a wire.  This object had to white flashing lights and a red light.  They moved very quickly and were too high to be landing at the airport but also to close together to be two planes flying in a identical pattern.  This went directly over my home.   My husband and I video taped with our Iphone but you can only see for a brief second both lights and their close proximity.   I then called my brother who lives in OCR, AL and told him to go look outside and sure enough he saw it come over the mountain and it appeared to be hea! ding in a South/West direction.  He to agreed this was not two planes flying that close together.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
Triangular light drifting high over Madison, AL in full daylight.;2012-08-22 13:10:00;2-3 minutes;Triangular light drifting high over Madison, AL in full daylight. At approximately 1:10pm I was letting my dog out when I looked up at the partly cloudy sky and saw what I first thought was a piece of paper drifting on the breeze a few hundred feet up and and away from me.  At first it seemed to be drifting with the wind current, but it kept performing little circular, round-about motions and twirling both down and up.  I was about to dismiss it as just what I had initially thought it was, when it turned into the wind and rose in altitude, starting performing circling aerobatics and headed towards a particularly large bank of clouds extremely high in the sky.  Right as it started heading higher I ran inside to get my camera, but when I had returned just a few seconds later it was already out of sight.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531

I looked up in the sky and saw one bright light- then it turned into 3! At first I thought it was a firework ((anonymous report));2017-11-13 21:00:00;4 seconds;I looked up in the sky and saw one bright light- then it turned into 3!  At first I thought it was a firework, but there was no sound and the lights didn't fall- they just disappeared. Some ppl told me it was probably flares from Redstone, but I think it was something more...  This is my first ever sighting!

Ball of light in an upward arc trajectory.;2020-08-01 22:50:00;~10 seconds;Ball of light in an upward arc trajectory Ball of light in northern sky.  Not sure of distance from my location but it was obviously larger (closer) than the light from a star, meteor, or satellite.  Confirmed on web that ISS was not flying over my location.  Did not have FAA beacons like a plane would have.  After noticing the light ball, object moved toward the east in an arc (upward) trajectory for a few seconds and disappeared.  No visible trail, just the ball of light moving.  Light was too large for a drone and was much faster than something like a Chinese lantern.  Just an eyeball judgement of altitude maybe a few thousand feet above ground level and about 2-3 miles north of my location.  There were a few small engine aircraft in the area and object was distinctly different.;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
