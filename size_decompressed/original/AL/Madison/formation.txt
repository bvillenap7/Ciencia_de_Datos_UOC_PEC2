We saw four to five lights that would circle around each other then dart off in different directions.  Nothing man made can move that fast in the sky!  They would move up, down, circle around, move left or right and then dash out of sight.  At times they would all disappear only to reappear slowly one at a time, but always appear in the same general area.  From my terrace on a hill, I could see them dance about very clearly.  My husband and sister also witnessed this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
Looking west from Madison Al (Limestone County)toward Decatur al. Approximately 21:30 central time. Cluster of 20 to 30 spheres.;2014-05-30 21:30:00;1 minutes;Looking west from Madison, AL, (Limestone County) toward Decatur, AL.   Approximately 21:30 central time.  Cluster of 20 to 30 sphere like lights.  Cluster (staggered) seemed to travel north to north east for at least 1 minute then disappeared.  May have been military craft or hot air balloons... not 100% sure.  I have no way of knowing.  Very strange.

Orange, large, three-object linear formation moving south to north approx. 60 degrees above horizon.;2014-06-30 21:50:00;2 minutes;Orange, large, three-object linear formation moving south to north approx. 60 degrees above horizon. Three-object linear formation seen on 6/30/14, approximately 21:50 Central.  Objects appeared approximately 60 degrees above the horizon, moving south to north.   Objects appeared perfectly evenly spaced, maybe ten seconds apart.  Size: equivalent to a pencil eraser held at arm's length.  Resembled a chase formation seen two years earlier involving the ISS, Russian rocket and ESA ATV resupply vehicle, except these objects were higher in the sky (60+ degrees), larger and brighter.   Also, no ISS sightings are scheduled for this region (Huntsville, AL)  until 7/12/14. All of these objects were the same color yellow-orange.   Very bright. No tail, no fireball. And no sound whatsoever.  As objects moved north they gained altitude, grew smaller and vanished.   Observer is a sober, master's-degreed human factors specialist with 25-plus years in manned space systems design (ISS program).;34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
