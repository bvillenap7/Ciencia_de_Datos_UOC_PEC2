Purple and green blinking stationary object.;2001-04-26 20:50:00;5+ minutes;Purple and green blinking stationary object. At first, I thought that the object might be a satellite or star, but then I noticed that it was blinking.  I went inside my house and grabbed my binoculars for a better look.  Upon closer inspection, the object had lights on it that were blinking purple and green, but no other features could be determined.  I called my wife out so she could see it, but she couldn't tell any more about it than I could.  After several minutes of staring at it do nothing but blink, I decided to go back inside. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been observing the star, Sirius, in the southern sky.  We receive many reports about that star.  PD));34.7042935294117;-86.7520758823531
