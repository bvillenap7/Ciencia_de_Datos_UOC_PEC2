Decending Green fire ball traveling east to west over south Mobile county , Alabama;2007-06-23 21:10:00;5 seconds;Decending Green fire ball traveling east to west over south Mobile county,  Alabama On saturday night at about 910 pm I was traveling south on ramsey road and approaching the intersection of highway 188 and ramsey road. Through the windshield of my car I saw what apeared to be a green fireball traveling from east to west decending through a high cloud layer.  The object continued glowing bright green dropping below the cloud layer until it reached the tree line at which time it was obscured. I am unable to estimate the objects distance or the speed at which it was traveling as I was also moving.  I saw an object similar to this  just two nights ago which I have reported separately.;30.4948;-88.3262
