Black triangle noiseless and stationary, then high velocity movement, 200 ft away.;1997-08-15 01:00:00;5-10 seconds;black triangle noiseless and stationary, then high velocity movement, 200 ft away I was 15 years old at the time of this sighting.  It was mid August and i was out of school.  A friend that had stayed the night and I decided to sneak out of my home and walk to the area know as the crossroads.  We were walking and smoking cigarettes and had wandered around that general area and decide to return home which was off of old Pascagoula road west of grand bay Wilmer road.   The sky was bright that night although there were some clouds up high.  I looked up and was startled to see a black triangle craft above us, about 200 feet high, hovering motionless and noiseless above.  It was about 60 feet across.  There were no lights on this craft.   I hit my friend in the shoulder and pointed up.  He looked immediately and had full view of the craft for about 4-5 seconds.  It quickly and noiselessly accelerated from a full stop and was out of eyesight instantly.  It scared me.  We ran to a neighboring home, owned by a local mechanic, and started frantically ! beating on the front door.  He did not respond and after about 2 minutes I regained my composure and decided to leave.  As we jogged away the gentleman came out of his home wearing a robe, brandishing a shotgun.  I remember this clearly and have absolutely no doubt about what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));30.4948;-88.3262
