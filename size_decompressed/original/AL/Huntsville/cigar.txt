What WAS that?;2014-09-05 19:30:00;5 seconds;What WAS that? A saw a dark colored Cigar shaped UFO at approxiamently 7:30pm.  I noticed towards my right the clouds looked similar to a UFO so i glanced at it for a few seconds.  It was dark out but, not quite dark yet and the clouds were darker than the sky.  As i began to seat myself, I noticed something moving across the sky in front of me.  My eyes were glued in wonder as it moved with glee across the atmosphere traveling left.  It didn't make a noise which is why i almost didn't see it.  It blended in with the sky like a 3D effect or maybe 4 or 5D.  Whatever that means.  I could not believe what i had seen.  It was like it defied gravity and that IS what it did.  It was amazing and wonderful to see.  It moved through the sky like that was what it was supposed to do.  Like nothing could tell it nothing.  As if it owned the sky!!  And there were no lights which made it even more unable to see.  It was so smooth.  IT DID NOT MAKE A SOUND!!!  I am truly amazed.  I thought I would never see this...  I always knew they were true!!  I now have my proof!!  Case is closed.  I was like, What is that?  It was moving so fast but not like super fast just gracefully fast.  I knew it couldn't be a plane or helicopter.  Birds are that that big and it did not flap.  I only saw it for maybe 5 or 6 seconds. I looked on for maybe 10 seconds more but i couldn't see it anymore though i tried. It vanished into the clouds and blended in so well.  It was gone!!  I did not want it to be. I knew it was gone.  It was there.  RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF MY EYES and it was gone!!!  I cannot believe my eyes!!!  I can not identify what it was and so is I have actually saw an UFO!!   WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
Me and my friend saw to very bright space crafts pass by my house while we watching the stars.;2016-11-02 23:00:00;1 hour;Me and my friend saw to very bright space crafts pass by my house while we watching the stars. We were staring at the stars and we noticed what we thought was a very bright star (it was also twinkling) and about 30 minutes later it started to move towards the tree line.  Then it was behind the tress completely and it would move in a random pattern until it came into the open sky and got brighter (it was changing colors from green, white, and red)  then it got almost blinding bright and seemed to get closer.  As it got closer it looked to be two space crafts, one big one shaped like a winged cigar shape and a second one trailing behind it that looked smaller and was shaped like a cylinder.  It sounded like an airplane that was shaky. When it passed by, nothing really happened after.  But before the space crafts came by, me and my friend were talking about a previous account of seeing a space craft in this area.  All in all, this was a very long experience and very stressful.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
