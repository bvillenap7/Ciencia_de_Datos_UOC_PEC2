Two sets of tiny white objects flying in formation in bright blue sky;2016-12-30 14:42:00;15 minutes;Two sets of tiny white objects flying in formation in bright blue sky I observed two apparently high flying objects on 12/30/16 from about 2:41 pm to 2:45 pm , moving west to east.  The objects, which were white, widely spaced, tiny pricks of light in an otherwise perfectly blue, clear sky moved in unison, with no visible difference in speed between them.  They were barely visible to the naked eye.  Polarized sun glasses helped make them much more visible due to their ability to darken the blue sky.   They moved out of sight to the east and moved in a very straight line the entire time of the observation.  Prevailing winds were light and westerly.  I photographed the objects with my full frame DSLR and was barely able to fit the objects in the same frame at 165mm focal length. I may have been content to believe they were balloons, but, approximately 8 or 10 minutes later, the same, or very similar objects were observed moving from north to south in very close formation, they were right next to each other.  They were observed for approximately a minute.  Their track appeared to be exactly perpendicular to that of the original two objects (I had a house dormer to compare them against), and they moved  in unison as the others did.  The wind  had not changed direction.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
