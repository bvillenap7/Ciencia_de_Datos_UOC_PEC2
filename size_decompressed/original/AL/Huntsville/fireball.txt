Blue-green, round, hazy light moving rapidly from north to south;2006-11-27 22:06:00;2 sec;I looked toward the west and witnessed a blue-green, round, hazy light moving rapidly from north to south.   There was a very thin cloud layer in the sky that did NOT obscure the stars.  The object was above this layer and I attribute its hazy appearance to that fact.   The light moved rapidly from a higher to lower altitude and seemed to follow a trajectory that made an angle of about 30 degrees with the ground.  From my vantage point at approximately 1250 feet in elevation, it appeared that the object was about 5 miles, or so, distant, and located over the Redstone Arsenal.  The object covered a large arc of sky in the very short time in which I viewed it.  The object gave the impression it would impact the ground somwhere south of my location.  I can see about 40 miles due to my mountain-top location.  I waited for several minutes for a sign of impact, but saw none.  The Alabama counties in which an impact could have taken place are Morgan and Marshall.  No sound from the object was audible.  I had attributed my sighting to a meteor, until a local newspaper ran an article about a similar sounding object that was seen a day later at a much earlier time (11/28/06 at 17:28).  Search lights, flares, rockets, missiles, and aitcraft are unlikely explanations for this object.  Humidity in the air would make search light beams visible and the shape of the spot on the clouds would have changed due to the angle of the light source.  The object maintained constant shape.  The apparent altitude and angle of sky covered would likely indicate supersonic velocity and probably a sonic boom, especially if the object had to avaoid collision with the ground.  The sudden appearance and disappearance of the object, and its constant luminance would also help rule out the other possibilities I mentioned.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
Orange fireball in South Huntsville in the eastern sky for about five minutes, no sound.;2013-07-27 22:30:00;3-5 minutes;Orange fireball in South Huntsville in the eastern sky for about five minutes, no sound. Myself and two others watched a bright orange fireball in the eastern sky moving from south to north while sitting outside at night.  It looked to be very high in the night sky, at least as high as the planes fly around my house.I had gotten up from my seat and just happened to glance up in between two trees and saw the object. At first I thought it was a very large asteroid because of the size and brightness and yelled for my friends to come see.  After about 30 seconds the object was growing in brightness and starting to slow down.  Another minute or so passed and the object changed direction and started heading towards the east.  At this point I took out my iphone to record the object but had a hard time keeping it in frame or in focus. I did get about a minute of footage before I shut off the record function.  The object continued to move off to the east at a slow pace before blinking out after about another minute. Weather was calm, no ground level wind.  There was a scattering of clouds in the sky and they looked to be moving from the SW to the NE.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671

drone launching pyrotechnics;2021-05-21 20:45:00;25 minutes;drone launching pyrotechnics Earlier this evening at around 8:45PM-9:15PM local time I witnessed some type of drone craft over Redstone Arsenal visible from a neighborhood just Northeast of Gate 10. It had lights and flashers consistent with FAA regulations. The craft slowed to a hover and after a couple minutes it delivered a payload of what seemed to be short-burst comet-type effects that lasted 8-10 seconds with 8 or 9 projectiles that launched out and then back toward the vessel in a circular arc. After the initial display the drone returned back southeast, was presumably reloaded and then delivered the same payload to the same location albeit slightly closer to my location about 10-12 minutes later. I dunno if they are working on some type of pyro display for a corporate retreat or 4th of July celebration, but it was pretty darn cool-looking for the small effect as it was. If a bunch of these were synced up to a timed show and launched closer to the audience radius I could see it h! aving a nice affect in conjunction with a traditional pyro display.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
