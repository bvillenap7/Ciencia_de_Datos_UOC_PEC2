Unknown Triangular craft near Huntsville;1998-10-20 22:00:00;10 minutes;Unknown Triangular craft near Huntsville I was traveling home, which is in Scottsboro from Huntsville, after a night meeting. I saw three triangular craft. The craft were flying low and crossed the road in front of me. They were low too not more than 50 feet above the tree tops. I thought they were helecopters until I was right on them. I pulled over for a minute to watch. They did'nt make a sound. They appeared to be black but it was dark. This is not the only time I saw the crafts eithier. I saw them two other times near the same place. The Huntsville area in North Alabama is home to Redstone Arsenal, which is the home of the US Army Missle Command and Marshall Space Flight Center NASA. Maybe the craft I saw belong to the Army or NASA. I  really don't know.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671

Three brilliantly colored purple lights streaked beyond the eastern horizon at a fantastic rate of speed.;2005-06-14 04:00:00;15 Seconds;Three brilliantly colored purple lights streaked beyond the eastern horizon at a fantastic rate of speed. I was a mile away from the mountains in the south when three brilliantly colored purple lights appeared over top of the mountains. The lights seemed to be connected as if they were on the tips of a craft. The lights sat stationary for several seconds, and then moved slowly over the mountain ridge. It then streaked beyond the eastern horizon at a fantastic rate of speed. The UFO was out of site in only a second or two. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.

large triangular object near UAH in Huntsville, Al moving very slowly with no sound;2007-04-05 19:00:00;7 minutes;large triangular object near UAH in Huntsville, Al moving very slowly with no sound I was coming home from work going down University Dr. east toward UAH when I saw in the horizon just above me in the distance two large bright lights.  The lights did not appear to be moving or moving very slowly.  My first thought was oh a airplane. But then immediantaly I said no that is not an airplane because the two lights are way to far apart to be an airplaine and there was no blinking light on it like airplanes have.  The two lights were probablly 3 times the wing span of an airplane accross.  I kept watching the lights as I went down the road and the two lights were fixed to each other and not making hardly any movement.  Then I turned off university to go to sparkman and just as I was right near uah I looked up and ther was a huge traingle shaped craft above my head.  It was grey and black in color and I could see it very clearly.  It had a red light on the bottom.  I kept traveling and as I turned north onto sparkamn I saw the lights moving to the northeast I could no longer make out the triangle shape I just saw the two widespaced huge lights.  This event caused me to call the 3 local tv stations and ask if any one had reported seeing a triangle in the sky.  The respone I got from all 3 stations was no.  They did not seem to even want to know what I had seen.  At this point I started to doubt what I had seen bec there was a lot of traffic on the road and someone else had to have seen it.  The only thing that makes me think I did not just imagine it is that I watched it for about 5 min.  before I actually was underneighth it and saw the shape of it.  My impression is that it may be some kind of exp aircraft because we live right near redstone arsenal.  The object was not making any really unsual movement except that it did not appear to move at all but hover or move very slowly and I heard absolutely no sound coming from it.

very aggressive'';2011-05-06 22:10:00;4-5 sec.;never done anything like this before...any how, may 6 around 10:10pm taken a short cut home on zierdt rd. in Huntsville AL., this road travels around 20 feet long side redstone arsenal for 3 or 4 miles, the object was coming at me from my driver side window very fast, i thought it was gonna crash into me, right when i thought that it took a very sharp turn behind the tree line, my wife told me to turn around, but i press the gas hard with my heart pumping...she didn't see it like i did...my guess is military object, it was blacker than black, no sound shaped like a perfect triangle, round white light close to each tip, and a bigger white round light in the center...crazy, my heart still races when i think about it...just seemed like it was trying to scare me?,very aggressive''...anyways that's my story...;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
Three yellow lights surrounding a central red light were seen on a black, presumably triangular shape flying low and silently.;2013-03-15 04:00:00;30 seconds;Three yellow lights surrounding a central red light were seen on a black, presumably triangular shape flying low and silently. As I was driving home from a friend’s house just after 4:00 am during the month of March in 2013, I observed an event traveling extremely low (just above the trees) and silently above my car. I proceeded to stop my car to watch the event. The location was Huntsville, Alabama on Whitesburg Drive between Byrd Spring and Four Mile Post Road. I clearly observed three yellow-white lights in a triangular formation around a central red light. They were on an object (presumably triangular, though I did not have time to discern a clear outline) that I could observe because there were no stars visible between the lights. There was absolutely no sound associated with the event, and I presume it could not have been any sort of conventional aircraft due to this fact and the altitude of flight (again, just above the trees on the corner at which I stopped). The event passed slowly overhead until it passed out of view. I exited my car to look, but I could no longer see the event or any evidence of its passing. Although I cannot estimate the size of the event too accurately, it was well over twenty feet across by my best guess. As a note, I do not tend to acknowledge the existence of extraterrestrials here on Earth, and I know of no sort of powered flight that could run so low and silently. This is why I refer to this phenomenon as an “event” rather than a “craft” or “object.” I can provide no explanation as to the cause of this event, however. I am currently a student studying fields of natural sciences, so I tend to favor no explanation rather than one that is fantastical in my opinion. I am somewhat familiar with what I would categorize as “U.F.O. lore,” but I do not treat it as fact. I have never used illegal drugs, and I was neither on prescription medication nor was I intoxicated at the time of this event. This was my first and only encounter with an event of this type.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671

Cat and mouse with triangular ship on Hwy 36.  Whoa!  Really wierd.;2017-11-14 21:00:00;10 minutes;Cat and mouse with triangular ship on Hwy 36.  Whoa!  Really wierd. Going to Decatur on Hwy 36, beside First Christian Church, I saw a silvery triangular ship with green lights on each corner as it darted just 100 ft. over the tree line.  Wasn't shocked  I saw a UFO in 1995, a large star-like one that came over our car.  Deadwood, Texas.  Huge and spherical with light from circular ports under the ship.   This triangular one I followed, like cat and mouse.  No lie!  It parked itself over the church and I got out to look.  The following week I was there again, same time, and saw a larger UFO sitting on the hill beside the junk yard as you approach Memorial Pkwy.  I thought it was a new tower with wide lights.  Upon approach I saw a disk ship, almost black, with lights fanning across the front.  Both UFOs sat motionless, hanging in the sky for at least five minutes before darting off to the south.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
