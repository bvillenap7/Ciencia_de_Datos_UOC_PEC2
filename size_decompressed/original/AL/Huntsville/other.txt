Bell or thimble shaped object rises out of Guntersville Lake and follows pair into Huntsville.;1988-02-15 21:00:00;45 minutes;Bell or thimble shaped object rises out of Guntersville Lake and follows pair into Huntsville. Late one evening (between 9 and 10 PM) in the winter of 1988 (possibly February), I (a high school student) was sitting on a boat dock at Guntersville Lake with one other person (a high school student) when a large bell or thimble shaped object rose from the water about  a quarter of a mile from us.  It rose straight up (higher than the tree line) and stopped. Too close for comfort, we got into our car and drove rapidly from the lake taking Hwy 72 through Scottsboro to Huntsville (a trip lasting approximately 35 minutes).  The object followed us just above the tree line rapidly moving from one side of the road to the other.  The object was bright enough to be seen through the street lights once we reached Huntsville and followed us on a twisting path through town. We stopped at my house near Redstone Arsenal and gathered up a pair of binoculars and a rifle scope to look more closely at the object that was now hovering over the neighbor’s house.  We were joined by my father (a restaurant manager) and a neighbor (profession unknown), and we all watched the object for approximately ten minutes.  It was bell or thimble shaped with varying colored lights around the outside of the object in a diagonal line from the bottom to the top.  It rotated counter clockwise and was light in color.  After ten minutes or so, the object rose rapidly and sped off to the southeast. I saw several strange luminous objects in the skies over Redstone Arsenal in the spring and summer that followed- often the same objects in the same general area several nights in a row--but none came close enough for me to distinguish their shapes.

A parked 737 in the sky accompanied by an orb;2009-01-09 09:00:00;4 minutes;A parked 737 in the sky accompanied by an orb Yesterday morning at around 9 am when I was driving to Huntsville, I saw a stationary 747 or 737 passenger plane parked in the sky about 100 feet above a field just to the right side of the road.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me at first because the car was in motion and I was definitely driving towards the nose of the plane, but as I got closer I realized that it was truly just sitting there parked in the sky.  To its right (my left) was an orb dancing around in the sky.  It seemed to reflect the sky on all its sides and appeared perfectly round and solid.  It was no bigger than a person would be if they were curled up in a ball.  When I realized that it was indeed parked in the sky, I pulled over and snapped a photo with my digital cell phone camera.  It isn’t that great but I have it if anyone wants to see it, and I will try my best to get it to sharpen in photoshop, but the actual raw photo taken at 9 am on 1-9-09 is in an email I just sent to this site.   The exact location of the craft was approximately ½ mile north of the Toyota plant in Huntsville on Pulaski Pike Rd.  I don’t know why it chose this location because there is only a field full of llamas and alpacas, some donkeys, horses and cows.  There is also a stream near by with fish in it.  Maybe it was surveying the area or something I don’t know.  But after I took the picture I was beside myself.  Back in 2000 when we lived in Texas, the whole family (kids, me, hubby) saw the exact same thing.  A large passenger plane parked in the sky, about the size of a 737 or 747, and it too was parked so low you could see every detail of its wings, engines, windows, paint job.   This one yesterday was painted with a silver grey bottom and orange on the sides (like a Northwestern Airlines plane).  It had no underbelly rocket boosters or anything, there was no way in the physical world it could have been hovering because passenger planes that are made to stay in flight while moving at 600 miles an hour simply drop to the ground if they are! motionl ess. About 30 seconds after I parked the car, it started to go away (I guess the occupants saw me?)  It went slow for about 5 seconds then disappeared going in an upwards north easterly direction very fast.  Also, the sphere that was dancing around everywhere disappeared.  Oh and the weather for the sighting was perfect, 100% clear sky, no clouds anywhere.  9 am, broad daylight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere, and quite credible.  We have looked at the photo, taken with a cell telephone, and the objects is reminiscent of a swept-wing airliner.  It is ambiguous, we believe, but the witness has volunteered to send NUFORC the same photo, after it has been processed by a photo lab.  PD));34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
Large orbs moving at a steady altitude and velocity;2010-07-04 20:50:00;2 hours;Large orbs moving at a steady altitude and velocity We witnessed a total of four occurrences of visitor activity on the 4th of July 2010 in the Lake Forest Subdivision of Huntsville Alabama.   At 8:50 PM we saw a single large reddish orange glowing orb coming from the south moving slowing northward it was very low, maybe 250 to 300' above the rooftops.  There was absolutely no sound being emitted from the illuminating sphere.  We watched it for about 5-10 minutes as it passed over our neighborhood and then got into our car and drove to the gas station at the corner of Martin and Zerdt roads.  We could see fireworks off in the distance so we sat in the car for about 15 minutes and watched.   As we drove home heading west on Martin Road, we saw a formation of 3 glowing orbs.  This time I really thought, hey these things are extraterrestrial and I want to make sure there not hot air balloons or helicopters.  So we slowed down to almost a complete stop, rolled down the windows to see if we could hear helicopter blades, but there was no sound at all.   And they were not hot air balloons.   We had traffic behind us, so we had to move on and we are not sure where they went, but assume they continued to move northward as did the first one.  We were sitting outside and then around 10 pm we saw one more solitary glowing orb, but at a higher altitude than the others and this one was either blinking, or something behind it was blinking and we watched it move northward as well, then the dog barked, we looked away and when we looked up again it had disappeared.   Then about 15 minutes later my boyfriend said, look at that satellite.  And I said, where?  Then I exclaimed, Wow, did you see that?   He said I sure did, wow!   We saw four distinct bright lights that looked like stars that were in a cluster which was kind of vibrating and then they formed into a line and just zip off into space on at a time very quickly.  It made warp speed seem slow, they just zipped up and off into space and where gone! in an instant.   Neither of us had ever witnessed anything like this before.  We believe that since the orbs were so slow moving and close to the ground there must have been a number of others who saw the same thing on that clear 4th of July night in Huntsville, Alabama. For the skeptics, I looked up sky lanterns and balloons on-line and just wanted to let you know that there was no way the first one or the second set of three that we saw were in any way sky lanterns. These illuminating things  were huge.  They moved steadily and with a purpose.  Not anything similar to a sky lantern and we were close enough to tell that they were not hot air balloons.   My boyfriend thinks they were as large as a VW bug and my estimate is a bit larger.  They did not flicker and produced an energy glow that was supernatural.   This is the first time I have ever looked at a ufo site and ever posted any such thing.   We are both of sound mind and we were not under the influence that night.   I'd like to know if anyone else has seen large orbs so closely?   Thanks.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671

It was a calm sunny morning.  There was no mistake that we both witnessed this, no possible way it was an illusion bc it was only about 100-200 feet off the ground and not far away at all.  I could not see what happened after we drove by bc there was a tree line along the road we were driving on.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671

We got home around 8:30 and my husband had taken our dogs out.  He called for me to come outside and look at something and when I looked up toward the mountains behind our house (which is a deserted land trust and state park), I saw a straight line of 5-7 slowly blinking lights with vague colors of red and blue.  The line seemed at least 2 to 3 football fields long and moved at a constant steady speed.  We could not see any other shape but the perfect straight flashing line of lights.  It moved in a direct southern direction until it was out of sight. My husband and I have never seen anything like this before and are both fairly common sense people but we are very sure of what we saw.  My husband and I are well educated with him being a retired Army SFC and NASA engineer as well as an online missionary, and myself a retired successful interior designer. We were quite fascinated and of course perplexed, but very sure of what we saw.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
Object burning as it flew in a trajectory parallel to the ground, with flaming pieces.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite re-entry.  PD));2015-06-29 00:30:00;1 minute;Saw something burning as it flew in a trajectory parallel to the ground, with pieces flaming out behind it. My wife and I saw something burning and leaving burning parts behind it as it flew in a trajectory parallel to the ground.  We've seen meteors falling before, but this seemed to be flying much more slowly, closer to us, and very large.   We stopped the car near our home in Owens Cross Roads, AL.  The object or objects were in the sky to the east, moving right to left, south to north, at about 10 degrees up in the sky.   My wife got out with her i-Phone and tried to film it, but because it was so dark, the camera would not focus.   Towards the end of the trajectory, before the stream of fiery objects went behind trees in the distance, we saw one particularly big piece light up into a huge yellow flame.  We tried calling 911 but they were too focused on their script and were no help.   We called local police, but they just said they'd check into it.  It would be good if other people reported seeing the same thing, and if we could determine what it was.  We really hope it was not an airplane. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) We're near Huntsville in Northern Alabama, not far from the Tennessee border. Not sure whether someone in NC or Georgia could have seen what we saw...it would depend on the time.  If they said 1:30 am, then it was probably the same thing (0030 Alabama (CST) time + 1 = 0130 EST). ((END ADDENDUM));34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
