Drone or VTOL.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible quad-copter??  PD));2014-04-16 14:10:00;30 minutes;Drone or VTOL Cross shaped flying object hovered anywhere from 20 ft off ground to 1000 ft off ground to where I could barely see it anymore.  Came back and just seemed to hover and then swoop back and forth.  Could be some sort of VTOL object.  It definitely was to precise and covered vast area to be remote control or civilian.  Perhaps not flying saucer but was some military drone. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible quad-copter??  PD));34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
