One evening somewhere around April/March 1975, I was driving north on Rideout Road with a friend.  There were other people pulled over to the side of the road looking at the sky.   We saw a light in the sky that looked like a low flying plane except the light was bigger than a plane's lights and it was flying in a scallopped pattern over an undeveloped wooded area on the east side of Rideout just north of Sherwood Park.   I drove around to the east side of the area where Bradford Drive deadended, got out of the car, and walked down the footpath into the woods, while my friend stayed with the car.   I remember seeing lights through the woods, standing there a few minutes, and then walking back to the car.  My friend said he was aware of crickets/bugs/birds being very loud, and then everything went quiet.   He lost sight of me in the dark and waited a couple of hours before I came back.  I thought it was minutes.  He said the crickets/birds started up again a few minutes before I came back.   He questioned me about what had happened, and I told him all I remembered was the lights through the trees and a voice saying, Are you afraid of your own mud?   We got back in the car and drove back to his house where we discovered that, even though the path and my shoes weren't particularly muddy, my jeans were covered with strange patterns of mud that looked like brush/finger strokes.  I also discovered I had a rash on both of my upper arms. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded quite credible to us.  She indicates that the date is approximate.

However, the red ball appeared to shoot white sparks that produced three white lights that formed a vertical formation under red light.  Then thought that my wife and I were seeing things and assumed the lights were a radio tower in the distance, but the formation started to move.  At that time our neighbors came out of the house and witnessed the object in the sky.  At that time the white lights disappeared and the red light moved about the sky unlike any conventional aircraft I have ever seen.  Then the red light appeared to head straight down into the ground, but could have gone past our view of the horizon.  This sighting was about 20 minutes total.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object buzzes aircraft.;1999-02-10 20:15:00;approx: 30 seconds;Object buzzes aircraft. Hello Brian.  I have an account I would like to share with you. I live just 30 miles south of Huntsville and have seen some strange objects in the sky where I live. Since you listed the pilots reports about some of their strange sightings I would like to share with you what I saw one winter eve. On Feb. 10, 1999 that night at 8:15 p.m. central I was outside enjoying the clear skies and beautiful stars evident in the winter months.  I was watching what appeared to be a commercial airliner traverse the skies from south to north towards Huntsville. As the airliner got to approx. 45 degrees above horizon while I was fixed watching it, suddenly a brilliant white star like object (round and approx. 4-8 feet in diameter) just appeared out of nowhere above and behind the airliner. It just blinked on and was at a estimated distance of perhaps 5-8 miles in the planes 9:00 position.  The light was motionless (for maybe .2-.3 second) after appearing then it zoomed down to the planes port side to a distance of approx. 1/4 mile away from the planes wing and the same apparent altitude. Once it reached this position it paced along the left side at the same speed as the airliner. I ran inside and got my wife and kids to come and watch as the object remained along side the plane until out of sight. The amazing thing about this incident was the objects speed. I've since given thought and some calculations as to the speed the object moved.  Since looking into the vastness of the space makes it difficult to determine exact distances but speculating distances and time the object traveled I surmised the object was at least 5 miles and possible as much as 8 miles away (assuming the airliner was at a typical altitude of between 28,000-32,000 ft. as a reference of distance from object to plane) and took only .3-.4 second to make up the distance that would equate to a velocity of between 45,000 to 96,000 mph. Pretty amazing to watch an object go from zero to 96,000 mph in an instant. The area where I live has in the past been a hot bed of UFO activity. One world known event occurred in Fyffe AL (1991 I think) where a cylindrical object was seen by hundreds of people including friends of mine. The object hovered over pastures where cattle mutilations were found the following day. One of my friends watched one eve coming home from work as it hovered and maneuvered slowly over a wooded area near Blountsville AL and shined a brilliant red beam to the ground. The next day the area was taped off with yellow tape and a crew resembling a bio-hazard team was scouring the area.  I have done some research into older cases that date back to the early forties and before. One was a coworker of my wife that saw a disc shaped object hovering above their farms pasture. Once the man (a boy of 10 at the time) approached the object it instantly disappeared. He described it as metallic brushed aluminum color, 40' in diameter and 10-12 feet thick as a perfect disc shaped and top/bottom equidistant from the center edge. This occurred in 1942. Another incident dating to 1938 where another acquaintance and a buddy was deer hunting in eastern Tennessee and saw a large disc craft between two mountains as he described down in a deep hollow move slowly below mountain peeks as if searching for something (wildlife?). I tried to shake him in his conviction to see if he would stick with his story and he told me so help me God we saw this......and we didn't tell anybody for a long time.  I am convinced that our government knows more than they are sharing.  Thanks for your time.  Thank you to the witness for this wonderful report.

Bright light moving and fading to dark, like high altitude rocket thruster, seen briefly near Cassiopea.;2004-08-06 22:15:00;15 seconds;Bright light moving and fading to dark, like high altitude rocket thruster, seen briefly near Cassiopea. While stargazing on said night with friend, friend went inside for few minutes.  We had been gazing at Casseopia, and a light in that direction caught my eye.  A few degrees SW of the center of Casseopia, it had not been there moments before.  It was a little brighter than Mars had been at its closest approach to Earth, but white.  Startled to see a planet where one shouldn't be, I observed the light begin to slowly fade after 4 or 5 seconds, making me wonder if I had happened to observe a nova.  I desperately wanted my friend to get back out there!  The light then began to make a slow arc of a few degrees, counter-clockwise, continuing to fade until it stopped moving/faded from view after about 10 seconds.  Maybe terrestrial, but sure looked like a high altitude rocket thrust...any reports of U.S. tests?;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
Bright green light(s) traveling east over Chapman Mountain.;2006-11-28 17:30:00;15 seconds;Bright green light(s) traveling east over Chapman Mountain. I was traveling east on I-565.  When I neared the top of Chapman Mountain, I saw one or two bright green lights in the sky.  The object moved very fast toward the east and looked like it might have also been descending.  I watched it move through the sky until it disappeared from my sight.  It kind of looked like one shot from a roman candle firework, so I almost dismissed it as such.  Then, my wife, who took a different route home, told me that saw the same object from a good distance north of me on Chase Road.  From her description, it seemed that she had an even better view of the object than I did, which makes me question whether it was a firework.

Rapidly moving object looks like it might impact ground;2007-01-05 20:59:00;2 sec;Rapidly moving object looks like it might impact ground As I looked west and up, I saw a light moving rapidly through the sky.  My first impression was that it was a satellite, but it was moving much too rapidly.  I have observed the International Space Station and it moved very slowly, in comparison. The magnitude and color (white like that of a satellite) of the light of the object was constant, and there was no tail behind the object, nor trail left in the sky following the object.  The object, at first, appeared to travelling roughly parallel to the ground, but as it moved away from me, it looked as though it had changed trajectory toward the ground and that it might impact somewhere on the Redstone Arsenal.  No impact was observed.  No sound was heard.  A small aircraft was flying from north to south at the time of the sighting and the object would have been visible to the pilot through the right-hand window.  My vantage  point is high above the city (approximately 600 feet) and visibility was unlimited.  The sky was perfectly clear with good astronomical seeing conditions.  I would estimate the object to have had a constant brightness of approximately equivalent to a star magnitude of 3 to 3.4.  It is possible that the object was a meteor, but its characteristics did not convince me that it was.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671

It moved fast,stopped, then bobbed before moving north. My boyfriend and I were observing the sky when we noticed an amber light.  It caught our attention due to the speed, and nature of which it moved.  It traveled across the sky quickly before stopping and bobbing up and down before disappearing (or moving so fast we couldn't see) and reappearing much lower in the sky.  There was a dim circumference of light around the amber light also.  It stopped and bobbed for a few minutes more before receding to the north.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671

Two moving yellowish lights over Huntsville, AL at 10:30 pm on July 8, 2019.;2019-07-08 22:24:00;30 seconds;Two moving yellowish lights over Huntsville, AL at 10:30 pm on July 8, 2019. In the sky over Huntsville or Redstone Arsenal, I noticed 2 bright yellowish lights and one blinking red light and did not hear any airplane or helicopter noise.  The yellowish lights appeared to be moving slowly, very close but in different directions.  After about 30 seconds they disappeared (not simultaneously, but separately).   It might have been some kind of a firework trail the way they faded from view, but it took a full 30 seconds for them to disappear and neither light moved downward.   After they were gone, I watched the blinking red light move toward the southwest over Redstone Arsenal toward the Huntsville Airport for an additional 30 seconds until it was obstructed from my view by a large tree.  I continued watching for 10 minutes but never saw the bright yellowish lights or the red blinking light again.  If I were to guess, I would suspect either some satellite-related event or two helicopters that turned on and off their lights too far away for me to hear them.  I suspect the red blinking light was a satellight;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
Saw 1 bright light that dimmed out & got really bright in an erratic manner,  the movement was unlike a plane or anything Ive ever seen;2020-08-19 16:15:00;15-20 minutes;Saw 1 bright light that dimmed out & got really bright in an erratic manner,  the movement was unlike a plane or anything Ive ever seen I saw this right after it rained and the sun came out bright and sunny with pretty much a clear sky. Our city experienced a double rainbow and of course everyone was looking at it and took to social media (I say this because I might not be the only one who saw it but idk). But that's when I noticed a single, VERY bright light that was small (my first initial thought was a plane or maybe a satellite). You could tell it was far away. It stuck out like a sore thumb. The brightness of the light was different and that's when I decided to watch it because I've never seen something like this. From my perspective, it started to moved towards the rainbow. It wasn't moving erratically and not necessarily in a straight line, but instead in a smooth fluid motion regardless if it was gaining or losing altitude. And it was moving fast considering how far away it was.  It's nowhere as fast as a shooting star but it was definitely way too fast to be a plane. Once it got to t! he rainbow, it stopped and sat motionless for maybe a minute or two. It then started to move back in the same direction it came from. Definitely never seen a plane do that. This whole time while I'm watching this light, the light was going in and out. Not flashing in and out, more like dimming. It wasn't sequential or in a pattern, you couldn't time it. It was completely random. Sometimes it would vanish for a split second up to a few seconds. And sometimes the light got brighter all the way up to an obnoxious bright. This went on for about 15 to 20 until I lost sight due to the tree line. A few moments later, I saw AN ACTUAL PLANE in the same general area as I just saw the light. The plane was very visible and I could easily make out the main components of it, as well as seeing and identifying the familiar flashing lights in perfect unison that all planes have. That's when I realized what I just saw a moment ago was 100% different, no doubt about it.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
