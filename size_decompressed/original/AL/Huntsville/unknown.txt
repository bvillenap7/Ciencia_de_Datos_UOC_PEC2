3 lights, light speed, no sound, 90 degree turn;1972-01-01 20:00:00;2 minutes;3 lights, light speed, no sound, 90 degree turn Date was sometime in the early 70s.  The Guess Who band was playing at Milton Frank stadium in Huntsville,AL. I was about 2 miles from stadium, standing outside listening to the music.  An object appeared coming toward me from the west at a level of about 3 telephone poles. It stopped directly over my head. The form was muted from city lights.  It flashed in sequence 3 different colored lights (can't remember colors) forming a triangle. It then proceeded 90 degrees from where it had came at light speed. It never made a sound! I have tried to pinpoint the date, one would think it easy to find out when the concert took place.  If you are interested and can find out when it was, please let me know.  I told people that after stopping and flashing the lights on me, that they found no intelligent life and proceeded on! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
Two bright lights which appeared to be stars.  They slowly faded out of sight.;2006-11-10 05:00:00;45 seconds;Two bright lights which appeared to be stars.  They slowly faded out of sight. I observed what I thought were 2 bright stars at about 290 degrees and elevation of 35 degrees.  I wondered why the 2 stars were so bright and after about 30 seconds they began to fade moving straight out into the heavens.  within 20 seconds their size and luminance went completely dark.  There were no clouds in the sky and I heard no noise.  the distance between them was about 3 inches at arms length and on a horizontal plane.  This was observed by me when I went out on my driveway to get the morning paper.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671

It proceeded to pass over the area that I was near.  Shortly afterwards I stopped at a local grocery store, while there in the parking lot I  could still see the brightly lite object north of me.  I noticed it was not moving but remained in a stationary position in the sky.  I appoached a couple of people in the parking lot and pointed out the object to them ,they both thought it was curious.  I then went into the store to get some groceries.  When I was finished shopping I went back out to the parking lot to my car,where I noticed the object was still there in the same position.  As I was putting my groceries into my car ,it started to move toward my direction.  Then all of a sudden a flash of extreme bright white light occurred.  As this was happening, the object started to desend into the tree line, after which I could no longer see it.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
