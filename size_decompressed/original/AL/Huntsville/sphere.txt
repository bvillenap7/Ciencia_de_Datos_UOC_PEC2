I was watching a jet liner moving N.E. at 30,000 ft.  plus when i saw a orange sphere moving at an incredible speed north to south.  My perception is it was at about 7000 ft.  It was not a meteore.  There was no firetrail or contrail.  There was no sound that came from it.  It covered 30 miles give or take in 5 seconds.  The sphere looked to be 100 ft across.  It was without a doubt in our atmosphere.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
Three orange orbs, not moving, in Huntsville, AL;2013-06-11 21:30:00;30 seconds;Three orange orbs, not moving, in Huntsville, AL I was letting my dog out in the backyard.  I looked directly south about 20-25 degrees over the horizon to see 3 orange orbs in mid-air.  I watched for approximately 15 seconds to see if they were moving then pulled out my iphone.  My phone's camera wasn't able to focus on the objects, they then disappeared.  The objects did not move, rise, or fall, they were stagnant, then were gone.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
Floating orbs that split into multiple orbs.;2013-06-30 14:00:00;30 seconds;Floating orbs that split into multiple orbs. On a clear day, myself and one other saw a strange white orb zigzagging and bobbing above us. The orb then split into two orbs, and the second orb split into a third. Now we see three orbs hovering and swirling, after a few seconds the orbs all return to the single orb we saw at first.  Very unsettling.
