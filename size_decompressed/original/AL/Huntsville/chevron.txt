Dark, quiet, large, slow moving, low flying object (about 2,000 ft. from the ground) seen N. bound into Huntsville, AL;2015-07-20 22:15:00;2 minutes;Dark, quiet, large, slow moving, low flying object (about 2,000 ft. from the ground) seen N. bound into Huntsville, AL Dark, quiet, large, slow moving, V-shaped and low flying object (about 2,000 ft. from the ground) seen North bound into Huntsville, AL.  Dim light, possibly reflected light, appeared to be on the top of the craft as it approached, but underside was very dark.  City ground lights helped to illuminate the object against the dark night sky.  Object moved at a constant low speed.  About 3 minutes prior to sighting, a low flying helicopter had flown South bound near about the same flight path, but of an altitude of only about 900 feet from the ground.  This is what brought attention to observing the night sky while smoking a cigarette.  It was too dark to take a photograph or video of the object.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
V-shaped Lights;2017-10-24 05:15:00;5 seconds;V-shaped Lights I was viewing the clear sky this morning, as I was walking across the parking lot in Research Park.  I was surprised to see a V-shaped pattern of lights going from North to South.  There was one lead light and maybe 3-4 lights equally distanced down each side.  It almost appeared that the body inside the object was translucent, it seemed that I could see through it.  I heard no sound and it appeared to be effortlessly gliding across the sky.  It passed over in five to ten seconds.;34.7166575342465;-86.587443287671
Thin, gray, wing-like object moving slowly south to north;2018-07-29 17:15:00;10 seconds;Thin, gray, wing-like object moving slowly south to north While mowing the grass, I took notice of an object moving in the partly cloudy sky.  The object reminded me of a glider with a very high aspect wing ratio (I would estimate about 25:1), and was a dull gray metallic color.  What I could not discern was any sign of engines, propellers, fuselage, or tail.  It was almost like a thick line, but slightly swept.  It was moving slowly from south to north.   I observed the object for approximately 10 seconds before it went out of view behind some trees.  It was only faintly visible due to its color, but my polarized sunglasses helped me see it better.  I could not tell its altitude, but it was below the high cirrus clouds, which I estimated to be 20,000 ft based on local air traffic, but above the lower, puffy cumulus clouds.  I tried and tried to see any other features, but there were none.  If it was a glider (I have seen plenty of those) or even a predator drone (we live near the Redstone Arsenal), its fuselage would have been visible, but was not.   Based on my observation, I would place the wing span somewhere around 300 ft, tip to tip. I have attached a rendering of the object I saw to a separate email.
