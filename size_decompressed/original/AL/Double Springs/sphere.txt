PD));2011-09-09 10:20:00;1 OR MORE HOURS;Strange bright spheres in the sky that sometimes changes colors and moves very fast and in strage directions My husband and I go outside every night and sit to enjoy the weather…about a week ago we started seeing strange movement in the sky …mainly in the east….looks to be a sphere shape that glows very brightly, and moves in all directions very fast…we watch this for about 20 mins and then just go back in the house…tonight, we went out and instead of one, there were two…one looked to be changing colors in the west, maybe a green and red and yellow…couldn’t tell exactly..One  was just very bright and as it moves almost looked like it had some sort of tracer behind it, and this one was in the east…  We go out at different times of the night, we have been looking every night now, tonight the first time we went out, nothing was there, second time there was only one and then we went out again and there were two….  The first time we seen any activity, my children saw it too…we actually videotaped it and tried to get pictures…so there has been a total of 4 witness this strange activity in the sky!;34.1378;-87.3945
