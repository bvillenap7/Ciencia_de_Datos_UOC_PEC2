At app. 23:00 I walked out on my front lawn and saw what I thought was a star going super nova.  I then started watching this diamond shape object move up then down then left to right.  The whole time I was watching it was glowing blueish green to orange to yellow to white.  My wife came outside and watched the event also.  I contacted the airport and they said no planes were in the app. area at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at a twinkling star.  PD));33.7402;-86.7701
