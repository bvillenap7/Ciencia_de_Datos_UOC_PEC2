At 10:03 PM on Thursday July 7th, 2016, our dog started to bark and growl at the window with what we thought was a bird.  Curious, we went outside so as to see what started as three glowing orange dots in the sky and grew into one larger formation.   They lingered around the sky moving slightly up and down before breaking into two, then splitting and fading away.   During the sighting we grabbed a recorder and got a shot of it but the batteries died afterward, which was strange as how it was at half battery, and the image looked warped.  We, my grandmother and I, looked at it through binoculars.  There appeared to be a blinking in the bottom of the crescent shape with a lingering, short trail that looked to be a smoldering orange.;33.5813;-85.8321
