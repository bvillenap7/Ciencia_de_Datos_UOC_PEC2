Fireballs in Oxford, AL;2012-05-03 21:00:00;2 minutes;Fireballs in Oxford, AL I saw two fireballs hovering over the Hampton Inn on Davis Loop.  They hovered for two minutes, then took off at a high rate of speed westward until I could no longer see them.  One appeared to follow the other.  I tried to record this, but due the crappy camera on my phone I could not zoom close enough to differentiate this from stars.  It was a clear night.;33.5813;-85.8321
