Crystalline Object appears briefly near Mount Cheaha in the Talladega National Forest.;2003-11-07 16:00:00;about 1 minute;Crystalline Object appears briefly near Mount Cheaha in the Talladega National Forest. I was just finishing work for the day, and was standing on the back porch of my place of employment. The day had been overcast and rainy. but at that time the sky had begun to clear and the sun had started to set. The still-heavy clouds were a brilliant array of orange, pink, purple, black and white, with some spots of clearing. I was standing facing south. preparing to go down the steps and into the parking lot when I noticed a sparkle of light emerge from one of the clouds, and pass through a clear spot of sky blue. The shape of the object was like a crystal, shining and with multiple facets from which the sun reflected. The object was spinning very fast, and it quickly passed through the clear patch of  sky and on up into another cloud. I did not see the object again after that, but felt disoriented and lightheaded, and had experienced about 10 minutes of missing time. The shining object was near Mount Cheaha in the Talladega National Forest, which is easily viewed from the back steps of the business where I am employed (a historical landmark) That same night I had an array of strange dreams about being taken up into a spacecraft.;33.5813;-85.8321
