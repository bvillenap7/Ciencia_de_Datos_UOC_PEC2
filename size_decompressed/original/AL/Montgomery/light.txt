Lights appear out of the woods and chase vehicle.;1973-10-17 23:30:00;15 minutes;Lights appear out of the woods and chase vehicle. I am writing about something that happened when I was 19 years old.   It occurred on Wednesday, October 17, 1973, on the outskirts of Montgomery, Alabama.    I have always wanted to report it, but I never realized there was a National Reporting Center until now.          When I was 19 I kept a diary and I wrote about this incident in my diary.  But even if I hadn’t written about it at that time, the occurrence and the terror we felt, will always be clear in my memory.      This is my account of what happened:   It was approximately 11:30 p.m. on Oct 17 1973.  My boyfriend (who was a sergeant in the air force) and I (a college student and worked full time) had driven out to the country.  We wanted to find a quiet, romantic place to park and spend some time alone together.       We went to an area where some new roads had been cut through the woods.  An area that was being prepared to build new homes, but no homes had been started to be built yet. Only the roads had been cleared.  The woods around the roads were still thick with trees and undergrowth.    We drove a good distance down the first new road until we came to a small cul-de-sac road that was cut back deep into the wooded area.  We drove to the end of the cul-de-sac and parked the car, facing up hill to the main road. We sat and talked for a while before we noticed a bright light moving slowly across the tops of the trees in the distance...it was across the main road a distance away.  We both watched this light for approximately ten minutes.  At first we thought it was a helicopter because it would move slowly across the trees and then stop in mid air, hover for a minute then continue slowly down the tree line. Once or twice it disappeared down behind the trees but it would reappear a few seconds later.     We rolled our windows down to see if we could hear the whirring of helicopter blades - but there was no sound at all.   Total quiet. We kept speculating what it could be as we were perplexed that it made no sound.   It finally moved on out of our vision so we shrugged our shoulders and changed the subject.  I’m not sure how much time passed...maybe 5 minutes but not more than 15 minutes when a bright light, like a huge spot light, flashed across our vehicle.  It didn’t stop and shine on the vehicle, it only flashed across our vehicle.     We both jumped and said, What was THAT?  My heart started pounding.   We looked all around us and didn’t see anything that would have caused a bright light like that to flash on the car.  We looked at each other, both of us frightened, said not a word but my boyfriend cranked up the car to get out of there. As soon as we cranked the car, a bright light - about the size of a basket ball - came floating out of the woods - about 5 to 6 feet off the ground - quickly towards our car. I say floating because it wasn’t bobbing up and down like it would if someone had a big spot light and was running with it....it wasn’t making any sound at all so it wasn’t a motorized vehicle, no bicycle could come through those thick woods like this light was...it was floating out of the woods at a very fast speed directly towards the car. We sped up the hill to turn off of the cul-de-sac onto the main road that lead out of that area.  As we approached the main road, a second light appeared  from the other side of the cul-de-sac and  began pursuit of our car at an even faster rate of speed.   My boyfriend floored the accelerator as we turned onto the main road.    The two lights did not follow the road behind us…..they took a short cut across the woods  between the cul-de-sac and the main road …. I mean straight through those thick woods…never slowed down, never veered or bobbed around….never making a sound…just floated straight across and through the heavy woods and out onto the main road  directly behind our vehicle.     I was panic stricken and screaming to go faster, go faster.     The lights stayed right behind us and my boyfriend was driving as fast as he could on that back country road. As we approached the exit out of that area onto the county road where there was other traffic, the lights vanished. During this incident, all we saw were the lights….we could see nothing of what was behind them.   We heard not a sound. The few people I told about this story,  said it was quite interesting but had the “weirdo liar“ looks on their faces.   But I know what happened and my boyfriend knew what happened and there was no explanation to what happened to us.;32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
Bright light coming from back yard and a surreal sensation of forboding.;1999-10-11 00:15:00;3 minutes;Bright light coming from back yard and a surreal sensation of forboding. At the time of this event I was 38 weeks pregnant and 27 years old.  I am now a 30 year old single mother, in a professional field and working towards a masters degree in computer science.  I'm a very grounded, technical minded person who is skeptical of all things that seem illogical or cannot be tangibly seen, and this is why I've waited so long in reporting this event. I was sleeping in the guest room alone due to my being uncomfortable in my pregnancy.  I had just moved to Montgomery, and my 17 year old sister was visiting in order to help me set up the house for the baby.  She was asleep in the den on a sleeper sofa.  Earlier in the night, we'd left the sliding glass doors open to let in fresh cool air because I was always complaining that I was too warm.  I recall that I awoke in the night and instinctively walked into the den, almost as if I were sleep walking, and indeed I believed that I was doing so at the time.  The entire room was bathed in light, coming from the back yard, and it was so bright that I could not see anything in the yard clearly - not the pool ten feet from the sliding glass doors, nor even the patio furniture directly outside.  I could see that there were forty or fifty large moths on the ceiling of the den, and their shadows were long from the light.  At this point I felt a deep dread and blacked out. The next morning I awoke in the guest bedroom with dirty feet.  I went immediately into the den to wake my sister, and shrunk back when I saw the moths on the ceiling.  They were not there the night before when I'd gone to bed, and seemed to me to be evidence of the event.  My sister's feet and bedsheets were not mussed or dirty, and it seemed she'd not been disturbed at all.  Never at any other point while I lived at this residence did so many moths enter the house at one time.;32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
Bright moving light spotted east of Montgomery, AL in early a.m. ~2 hours before sunrise;2004-10-04 05:30:00;5 minutes;Bright moving light spotted east of Montgomery, AL in early a.m. ~2 hours before sunrise Very bright relative to normal star brightness spotted in sky ~45 degrees from horizon due east of Montgomery.  Light was moving slowly relative to a star appearing near it in the sky.  After observing this movement about 10 seconds, the light stopped.  Several minutes passed by and the light remained stationary.  I figured if I went to my office (from the parking lot where I initially spotted the light) and the light was not there, classifying the light as an 'unidentified' flying object would be justified.  I went to my office, looked out the window and only saw the relatively dim star near where the light was, but the bright light was gone.  Please contact ((e-address deleted)) to report similar observances.  If the UFO appears again during the next couple weeks, I will consider purchasing a telescope/camcorder to make a video for your viewing pleasure. ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS was not visible from Montgomery, AL, on October 04, 2004, so that could not have been the cause of the sighting.  PD));32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
UFO-Montgomery, Alabama.;2015-07-04 21:00:00;5 minutes;UFO - Montgomery Alabama A bright white light appeared over downtown Montgomery prior to the firework show.  It then turned red, and proceeded to go away and towards our location real fast.   Then it turned on a dime and flew at jet plane speed to the east and out if sight.  Then returned as fast as it left and hovered over Montgomery for about four minutes then disappeared.   Its altitude was approximately 5000 feet and was too fast for a drone.   I took pictures with my I phone but too many city lights make it difficult to ID.;32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
