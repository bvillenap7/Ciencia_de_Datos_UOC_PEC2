Pilots see unknown;2005-05-19 22:00:00;7 seconds;pilots see unknown Enroute from Houston to Columbia, SC at 35,000 feet in a jet airliner.   As captain I noticed an unknown aircraft at my 10 o'clock position high.  At first I thought it was another aircraft and looked at my TCAS.  There was no aircraft around in that vicinity.  I then looked back at the craft noticing it was passing us like we were sitting still while we were at Mach .78.  I also noticed it was at least 40,000 feet higher than us.   Pointed the target out to the first officer and she saw it as well. It may have been a satellite but it seemed to change directions as got directly off our nose and then dissappeared.   Object seemed to have a strobes. We both know it was not a shooting star so it was either satellite or unexplained. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.

Unknown flying object in Alabama;2006-02-13 04:35:00;30min-1hour;Unknown flying object in Alabama I had just completed a report for college, and was taking the trash out. During the time i was outside, i was trying to spot which way the sun would rise, i thought the whole event was funny because while it was a little bright on one side it was still dark on the other side. When the garbage can was finnaly by the road, i decieded to take in more of the early morning view and as i'm turning around to look for the moon i spotted what appeared to be a star.  When i watched the object in question for about three more minitues i noticed that it moved very slightly, i was trying to reasonable about it could have been, first i thought it could have been an airplane but realised that it was'nt simply because of the time, it wasnt a blimp also because of the time, i tried to mentally check off a list of every possible of what it could have been, but i could come up with explanation of what it was.  So i called my older sister outside of the house to come take a look, and all she could do was look no words could excape her mouth, so i asked her what do you think it is, i truly think its a UFO, and she answered it looks like one!? then asked her does it appear as though it is moving? and she said yes, i then told her to watch while i get my camara, she then shouted hurry up it looks like its leaving! a couple of seconds later she said never mind its still there. as i run outside the house with my camara and snap the first picture, it starts to move more and with every picture i took the more it moved, finally when i thought that i had enough pictures, my sister and myself retreated back into the house, at around 4:55 a.m. i went back outside to see if was still there and it was, which lead me to believe that it was there long after i went back into my home.  At the time the pictures were taken everyone in the neighborhood was still asleep, because when i atempted to show the pictures to a close friend and neighbor, she and her mother did not believe me, which left me disheartened at what i and my sister had seen.;32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
Lights move from NE to SW above Montgomery AL;2008-10-30 06:05:00;4 minutes;Lights move from NE to SW above Montgomery AL At 06:05, on 30 October 2008, the witness did observe a bright object appearing in the North-East sky.  This object appeared to be a planet like light in the sky, which moved, over a period of about 4 minutes to the South-West. As the object moved from North-East to South-West, the lights became more defined and appeared to be the landing lights of a commercial airliner.  However, the object had no flashing beacons.  It appeared as though the object was several hundred feet in the air, as it passed quietly overhead.  In it’s passing it’s white light appeared to change color to an orange. After passing directly overhead, the observer noticed a conventional airliner approaching  the object, on a near intercept course, but obviously at a much higher altitude.  Neither object appeared to take make any noticeable course changes, or take any notice of the other.  The object continued to the South-West until it disappeared. The observer, of the above mentioned object, is employed as a Staff Engineer, working in the Communication Technology field, with over 20 years Information Technology experience.;32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
High, fast, zig-zag/wobbly flight pattern ...;2010-08-12 22:30:00;One minute;High, fast, zig-zag/wobbly flight pattern ... My daughter and I were sitting in the backyard looking at the Perseid meteor shower when we noticed a strange aircraft much higher in the sky than any of the other planes we had been observing that evening.  It had all bright white lights and was traveling toward the N-NE extremely fast with a zig-zag/wobbling sort of flight pattern, unlike any aircraft that we had ever seen.  It continued on it's jerky direct path until we could no longer see it.   Does anyone know what that craft could possibly be?
