May  have entered Florida, crossed Alabama and landed in Tennessee. Reported  written up in The Montgomery Advertiser. While stopped for a traffic light I viewed through the front windshield a large burning object which I assumed to be a meteor. It was on a trajectory which would let it crash about 3 or more miles to the Northwest of my position.  Another viewer saw it from a position on a bridge about 2 miles to the East from a higher elevation and said it looked much higher to him . This same viewer said it was noted in the local paper, either The Montgomery Advertiser or The Alabama Journal. He also said he read that it had crossed Florida and had gone down in Tennessee .The object appeared red to me and the other viewer said it lit up the sky. He said a piece of the tail split off and drifted behind the great ball of fire.;32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
Fireball in the sky.;2015-07-11 21:15:00;9:25;Fireball in the sky. Looking from a distance it appeared as an big  dark orange star.. then it started to move over in the direction in which I was driving.  It began to get lower which made it look bigger to revealed a deep orange red center with a light orange ragged outter side.  Then it proceeded to shoot upward in a zigzag motion until  it was no longer within my view..freaked me out..;32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
