The next morining at around 6 am we found remains of things that appeared to be tinfoil like but as strong as metal and the grass appeared to be burned or torched. ((NUFORC Note:  Certainly a hoax.

Four glowing orbs present in the night sky, traveling not spontaneously, and making no noise.;2012-11-24 20:25:00;5 minutes;Four glowing orbs present in the night sky, traveling not spontaneously, and making no noise. We saw a red glowing orb that changed sometimes from yellowish orange to red.  It made a slow (slower than a plane) arc from right to left.  It then traveled toward us for a little bit, then directly away and the light dimmed out.   A few seconds later, a second orb did the same thing, but traveling a little bit differently.  It's light dimmed out, and then we saw a third orb.   A fourth orb going in an opposite direction (90 degrees from these three) came into view.  It was more obscured by trees.  The light glowed, and was not like an electric light.  It's movement  was not spontaneous.   The first orb came toward us, changing from it's original direction, and then moved in the exact opposite way, sped up, and then dimmed out.  It made no noise.

2 extremely bright lights moving slowly and disappearing in night sky.;2016-12-01 17:30:00;1 minute;2 extremely bright lights moving slowly and disappearing in night sky. I was on my front porch after the sun went down looking up at the stars and I see 2 bright lights near this one star towards the south.  They were nearly as bright as Alpha Centauri.  They stayed still for about 30 seconds then they both started moving slowly at the same speed toward the star then the first one disappeared.  The second went a little past the star and disappeared as well.  Nothing else strange happened afterwards but my mouth was wide open in awe.;32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
7 silent red orbs moving at a moderate rate of speed, high up in the sky, and then disappearing into the clouds.  10 minutes.;2017-05-07 20:00:00;10 minutes;7 silent red orbs moving at a moderate rate of speed, high up in the sky, and then disappearing into the clouds.  10 minutes. While on break outside where I work in the parking lot, me and another fellow employee on break saw a total of 7 circular red orbs moving from NNE to SSW at a moderate rate of speed.   First there were two, and then as they moved further South they disappeared into the clouds, then three more appeared moving from and to the same direction, and as they disappeared, then two more appeared moving from and to the same direction (moving NNE to SSW).   These moved over the entirety of the city of Montgomery and were still heading south until they disappeared into the clouds.;32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
