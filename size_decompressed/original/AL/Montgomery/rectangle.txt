Strange object over Montgomery Alabama;1994-06-01 17:00:00;5 min;Strange object over Montgomery Alabama This date is approximate and I am going by the other two post for this date on this website for Montgomery as this was about the date that this happened and by my guess it is pretty close if not the exact date.  All the news stations in Montgomery were reporting stange lights in the skies above Montgomery and you could see them far into the air. Everyone was talking about it and I don't know anyone that believes in UFO's. The lights were triangle in position and hovered for hours.  I never could really see them very well until about the third day into this when just like the other gentlemen I was watching television and noticed this strange object with lights flashing out the window. Some of my friends were in another part of the house when I went to get them to come outside. We all stood in silence and looked at this retangle shape object with what I remember to be different colored lights and they were flashing. It looked like something you would see at an amusement park but huge. Like the other post this was also near a water tower but on another side of town from the other post. From what I have read this object must have traveled from AUM to over the VA hospital to where I am near baptist hospital (East to West) This object was approx. a quarter mile away and went below the tree line as if landing. We all piled in the car to see if we could find it but there was no sign of it and we never heard anyone else talk about it.  I've always wondered what it could have been and don't think it was aliens or anything like that but after that we never heard or saw anything about it in the news and the story quickly faded away.;32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
