It dissapeared behind a large cloud after two F-16's were racing towards it. It was a about 1300 hours and I was coming back from lunch. I was smoking my cigar in the shade of the building and I was by myself. After I noticed a very bright, metallic object just NE of my location.  The sun was high and behind me. The wind was blowing lightly toward the SW.  It was a beautiful day with occasional large fluffy clouds drifting by. As I watched the object, it seemed to be creeping up and away at one time, so I thought that it may be very far away at that point. Even though it appeared to be rather close.  Then it moved towards the towards the East. About 3 minutes after I noticed the object, two employees came out to have a smoke break.  I asked them what they thought. They were both retired from the military.  They said they didn't know what it was either.  After they finished their cigarettes, they went back inside but I stayed and watched because I had some cigar left anyway. As the object moved East, I tried to guage the speed by a fence at the end of the parking lot.  It took about a minute to go the distance between each of the fence posts (it is a high chain link fence with poles 10' apart). After moving between 5 or 6 fence posts, a large cloud came drifting towards my location. At this point I lost sight of the object.  I waited to see if I could see it after the cloud moved.  I gave up after a few minutes and thought to myself, if it was something important, the local air force base would send a jet to check it out.  As I started to go inside, two jets, I'm guessing F-16's, came flying by side by side heading in the direction of the object.  They both disappeard behind the cloud and I lost sight of them and the object as well.;32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
Fast moving soundless white sphere;2020-04-12 12:00:00;seconds;Fast moving soundless white sphere A small white spherical object moved across the sky from NW to SE in a straight trajectory from horizon to horizon with seconds and was quite visible in the clear daytime sky.  A plane was flying far above in the sky at the time and appeared to be moving very slowly in comparison.  In comparison the plane appeared larger.  There was no sound and it left no trail.  I've never seen anything like it before and wondered if satellites can be seen during the daytime like that and if they move across the sky that quickly?  (Although it appeared to me to be closer to the Earth than the plane far above it, but maybe that was an illusion to my eye?);32.3711191507433;-86.1961232696413
