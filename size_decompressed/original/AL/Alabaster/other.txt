No noise at all. I reported this info to another site and saw your article in the Shelby County Reporter.  So Iâ€™m forwarding this to you.   I have worked at airports my entire working career and have seen all types of aircraft.  This event was stunning and highly unusual. Just before work around 10 pm, I went outside and observed 3 orange orbs moving closer to my location.  It caught my eye immediately.  They appeared to be in formation, but as it got closer, it turned.  It appeared the objects where in unison and possible the outer edges of a larger object.   I ran inside and got my spouse without saying anything.  We observed the orbs several minutes and tried to take several pictures.  The camera would not focus on object through the trees, winter time.  I then ran back in the house and got my daughter and her friend without saying anything.  They were stunned.   She got in her vehicle to follow the object but did not have success.  The orbs moved in from the northeast and turned east before going out of sight.  Absolutely no noise at all.  Objects moving against the prevailing wind and did not appear to change height.;33.1939000000001;-86.7915999999999
