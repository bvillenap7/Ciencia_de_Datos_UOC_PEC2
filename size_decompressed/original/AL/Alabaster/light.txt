((anonymous report));2016-11-11 23:00:00;27 seconds;Light anomaly that didnt blink spotted sitting still than moving slow I was on my way home around midnight and as i entered my neighborhood i saw a bright light hovering over the houses, but it was way off in the horizon.  It sat, didnt blink, and as i tried to find a proper place to pull over and record it began to slowly move foward and eventually going behind the treeline amd other houses.
