Large group of glowing orbs over my house!!;2013-03-15 20:19:00;3 minutes;Large group of glowing orbs over my house!! My husband was outside on the deck smoking and hollered for me to come there NOW or I would miss it! I thought it was large embers from someone's fireplace. It was fireball orbs flying from SW to NE directly over our house.  There was NO SOUND!   When all had passed, we thought it was over, but a single orb came trying to catch up going twice as fast as the others! I posted this when I read the article on your site about glowing orbs and wanted everyone who had witnessed some to write in about them. Wonder why so many now?  And , how about the tremendous jump in UFO activity in Canada!!  Good luck with your research and keep us in the know!!!;33.1939000000001;-86.7915999999999
