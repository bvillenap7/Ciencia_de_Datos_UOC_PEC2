And I don't stare at the sky looking for stuff either.  Wish I knew what it was... not man made! My oldest son had just started driving.  As a precaution, I placed an app on his cell phone that would allow me to ping his location and trace him if needed.  Just for fun, my 13 year old son and I decided to test it on the way home... just to see where he was at.  We traced him to a neighborhood about 2 miles from the house, where he was visiting friends.  We honked and waved at him as we passed him sitting in his truck.  We stopped at a stop sign in this very populated neighborhood.  While stopped, a bright green (almost lime green neon) cylinder/capsule shaped object appeared high in the sky.  This object was not moving.  It was just hovering.  After about 5 seconds... it started to move very slowly and then suddenly it flew at a phenomenal speed and suddenly disappeared.  My son looked at me and said, Dad... did you see that?  I immediately called my oldest son to see if he or any of his friends saw it.  They didn't.  I checked the news for t! he next week, and even surfed the net.  Nothing was ever mentioned about anything.  This was only 30 minutes from the largest city in Alabama.  There is no way that we were the only people to see this.  It was not a man made craft.  The only possible thing I believe it could have been (if not alien) is a projected laser in sky.  We aren't crazy and we don't stare at the sky looking for UFOs.  I had to estimate the date, but I know it was summer of 2012 and just starting to turn dark.
