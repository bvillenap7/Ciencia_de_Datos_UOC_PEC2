None of the lights flashed or had typical airline marker lights. It didn’t make any noise that I could hear. I thought it might have been a drone but it was too large for the height it was at. I stopped in the middle of the road and started videoing through my open sunroof. The object had already came directly over me by the time I got the sunroof open and phone out to record. It was already passed me but had started moving back toward me, then it moved away from me again. In the video it looks like one light, I guess I wasn’t zoomed in enough on it. The video is a little shaky and it is still dark so nothing to compare the speed to. The video makes it look like it’s moving fast from side to side but I think that was me moving. There was a vehicle in front of me and I bet they saw it also. This was on Apple Grove road near the old Ryan school.;34.2701;-86.6211
