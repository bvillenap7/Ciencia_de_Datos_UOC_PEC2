As I was driving south to southwest it fell straight down in the distance, maybe 5 miles ahead and I first noticed at the uppermost part of the windshield,it was extremely bright and very large and fell straight down until it disappeared behind the tree line.  I assumed it would have fell in or near Lay Lake (Coosa River).  I assumed it was a solar panel, but being so well shaped and showing no tail or flame or smoke it seemed odd.;33.0784;-86.5529
