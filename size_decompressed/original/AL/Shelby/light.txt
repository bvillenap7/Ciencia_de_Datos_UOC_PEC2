White star looking object that grew very large, and disappeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Flare from Iridium satellite?  PD));2015-01-09 18:45:00;10 seconds;White star looking object that grew very large, and disappeared. At first, I thought I was looking at an star, then realized it was moving.  The light increased to a very large size, then dimmed quickly and disappeared.   I watched for a while after to see if it would reappear and there was nothing.   I have worked in the space industry for many years so this caught me off guard, as it was like nothing I have witnessed before. ((NUFORC Note:  Flare from Iridium satellite?  PD));33.0784;-86.5529
