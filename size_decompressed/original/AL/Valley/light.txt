Just now 2 star like objects moving in a south to north fashion were just spotted.  These objects always appear to be moving stars and sometimes if straight over head they will start burning real bright, then dull back down.  Some people try to say their satellites but I find that hard to believe when I see 13 of them in a 50min period, with the naked eye.  The only way to describe it is a moving star that can be seen approaching at a 45degree angle sometimes and leaving on the horizon as far as possible with binoculars sometimes.  The second one seen tonight wasn't quite straight over head but off to my left and appeared to get brighter and lighter, within a rhythm.  This is along the Chattahoochee River and they always appear to be going north-south or south-north.  If the skies right they can be seen every night.  Oh yea, the sky was perfect this evening and two jets traveling north-south came over spraying a very thick trail within a 10 min period straight over head.  10 min later a large jet flying south-north but between their two trails passed over head.  Someone tell me what these flying stars are, that move at a constant speed every night.  I live near the Troup-Heard Corridor and south of West Point Lake, in the town where the famous Valley, Alabama, UFO pic was taken, and know the guys in the local media that covered it then.;32.8113;-85.1749
More flying dots stars, this one noticably large and bright.;2014-09-17 21:33:00;5 minutes;More flying dots stars, this one noticably large and bright. Flying stars just seen again.  Just went back outside after making my first report and looked in the south-south west and saw a very large star approaching at a 45 degree angle.  It came directly over and headed northnorth-west, never changing speeds or brightness.  It looked like a very bright moving star.   When it got just over head, another appeared inmy view traveling north to south right past the first one.  This one was noticeable different in size and brightness, don't know if that's because of the distance it was from me or the size.   Does someone know what times the satellites fly over Valley, Alabama???   This was at 9:33pm.  Oh, at 9:37pm I think a shooting star flashed over head after these two objects past.;32.8113;-85.1749
Huge white light!!!!!!;2014-10-06 19:48:00;7 minutes;Huge white light!!!!!! Huge white light heading northeast!!!   I'm in Chambers County Alabama and at 7:48 Eastern time a huge white light flew over heading north east...  My father noticed it first and said, there goes a satellite, then pausing when he realized how big this thing was.  This thing moved slowly and I watched it move off greater than 45 degrees on the horizon.  Does anyone know if it was a space station or anything on record at that time and place???  It was larger and brighter than any star in the sky.  Oh, also their was still light in the sky at the time so whatever this was, was very bright!!;32.8113;-85.1749
