Very bright sphere of light that managed to defy the laws of physics in rural Alabama.;2007-06-04 21:35:00;20 Seconds;Very bright sphere of light that managed to defy the laws of physics in rural Alabama. I walked outside while talking on the phone with my girlfriend. I looked up and saw a very bright sphere of white light (estimate of 3 miles away) moving at an incredible speed towards the north for aprroximately 15 seconds.  At first, I assumed it was a firefly since I live in the woods, but this light did NOT blink.  I also thought it was an airplane because they are constantly traveling back and forth from Atlanta but there were no red, blue, or blinking lights.  Next, I thought it could be a shooting star but it had no tail of debree and remained in my view for an extended period.  As the object moved in a straight line to the north, it changed direction, which seemed to defy the laws of physics, and headed west.  This is when I knew it was not a shooting star because this object also zigzagged a couple of seconds after changing direction in a S type curve.  The change of direction and zigzag motion seemed to last approximately 5 seconds.  This object had to be moving at least twice as fast as a commercial airplane. I tried following the object in the air, but the woods blocked my view from further tracking the object with my eyes. This has got to be the MOST incredible thing I have EVER seen.
