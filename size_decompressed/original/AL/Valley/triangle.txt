Please, someone tell me what this was???  Just now I was setting inside the house an heard a low rumble coming over..  I didn't pay it any attention at first just thinking it was a jet, but after 30sec or so something just didn't feel right..  What I think made me get up is the rumble just seemed to last to long like the sound was moving slow..  I ran out side to see two triangle looking craft (I say triangle because I so two white lights in the back and one single red light in the front center (the red light may have been located beween the center and the apex of the nose??  The two were in formation one behind the other..  Either they were huge in size or they were super quiet and low..  I say that because for a jet sound it was quiet and moving very very slow!!  Either it was way up in the sky and just looked close or it was a special jet one??  It was moving just east of the Alabama, Ga. line right above Valley, Al flying south...  Does anybody reconiz! e the description of the lights I saw on any military air craft??  This was totally awsome to see!!!  Thanks;32.8113;-85.1749
