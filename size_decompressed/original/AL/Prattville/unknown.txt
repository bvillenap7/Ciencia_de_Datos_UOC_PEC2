I was driving on I-65 N from Montgomery, AL, to Prattville, AL. and looked to the North-East, where there was a strand of lights over Prattville.  I counted to fifteen lights before I lost count, because they were all moving around.  The lights stretched from high in the sky and far behind the front of the pack, all the way down to the tree line.  They looked like airplanes coming down at a major airport, but there is no airport in that part of the area. I continued to watch for the lights until I went into a wooded part of the interstate.  When I emerged a couple of miles down the road, I didn’t see any lights what-so-ever.  I never heard any noise at all. I even got my fiancé and her mother to step outside, because the lights looked like they were close to their house, but by the time they were outside, they didn’t see anything, nor did they ever hear anything. I watched the lights for a total of about 2 minutes before they disappeared.;32.4735855999999;-86.4555064
