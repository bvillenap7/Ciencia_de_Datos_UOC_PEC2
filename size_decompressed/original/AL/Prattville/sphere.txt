Upon observing it, we noticed a small orange sphere to the left of the partial rainbow, and just above the tree line.  I assumed it was venus reflecting light of the sun.  I took several photos of the unexplained objects, but it wasnt until I got home that I realized the orange sphere had darted upward about 200ft,and then shot left 1000 ft just below the partial rainbow!  Once it was located below,the partial rainbow turned almost WHITE it became so bright, then the sphere was gone!;32.4735855999999;-86.4555064
