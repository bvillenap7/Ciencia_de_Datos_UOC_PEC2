Bright reddish-orange orbs travel NW in triangle formation, followed by other orbs.;2013-04-26 23:00:00;10 minutes;Bright reddish-orange orbs travel NW in triangle formation, followed by other orbs. It happened around 11pm CDT in Prattville, Al.  The night was relatively clear with just a few clouds.  My mother and I were sitting on our porch at our apartment simply talking.  I was facing away from the building towards Montgomery. When I first noticed the objects I could only register them as “bright lights.”  The longer I stared the more they resembled “orbs,” bright reddish-orange orbs.  They seemed to be traveling NW, towards Birmingham, and a steady pace, not very fast. The first set of orbs in the front were brighter than most and in a triangle formation.  That set was followed by several other orbs I could have probably counted 7 other orbs.  The orbs did not produce sound. After watching and panicking for a bit, I ran inside to get my phone while my mother and brother ran downstairs to the front of our building to record on her phone.  She said that she saw “at least 15 other orbs.”  I came back on the porch with my phone and the orbs were still there, and still traveling at the same speed in the same direction.  The entire duration of what we witnessed was probably around 10 minutes, though it seemed like forever.  The orbs then faded out one by one, as if they were ascending. This is the first time this has ever happened to me.  And it’s very unnerving to view other reports in the same state that are so similar.  Not to mention Central Alabama alone. Is there a such thing as an explanation?;32.4735855999999;-86.4555064
