The Four glowing orbs that seemed to dance together.;1984-07-01 16:00:00;10 seconds;The Four glowing orbs that seemed to dance together. Approximately 1984 my Grandmother and I were out for a walk in Tingle park. There are many tree carvings on cedar trees.  It was in the afternoon approximately 16:00 hours my grandmother and I were enjoying an afternoon walk. Something encouraged me to look up into the sky. I didnt realize it at the time my grandmother looked up into the sky the same time I was looking. What I saw I consider a gift.  As soon as I looked up I saw 4 orbs or circular shaped ufos.  I would say they were several thousand feet in the sky.  They were really high. Three of the orbs were blue and one was red. They all moved together in a line. Then the red orb became stationary. The three blue orbs started to circle around the red orb. Keep in mind it was during daylight hours.  The orbs seemed to glow. Very visible in broad daylight. It seemed as if the blue orbs circling the red one were dancing. Then the three blue orbs shot off in different directions at lighting speed. The red orb moved In a small circular pattern , by itself and , and shot out of view at lighting speed. During this experience there was no sound. When they were gone I looked at my grandmother and she was smiling. She said they were angels. I wasnâ€™t sure what they were. I was left confused and amazed at the same time. This experience I will always cherish because I had it with someone I loved with my whole heart.;33.1275000000007;-86.8587999999992
