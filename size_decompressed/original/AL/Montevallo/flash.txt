Green fireball object shooting downward from the sky.;2014-03-10 00:30:00;30 seconds;Green fireball object shooting downward from the sky. The sky was fairly clear and bright as I drove along Hwy 22 from Calera, AL, heading toward Hwy 119 in Montevallo, AL.  It was approximately 12:30 am the morning of March 10, 2014. As I drove along I gazed out my driver side window and noticed an orange fire ball like object with a green tail as though a huge roman candle had been lit in space and aimed downwards to earth.  It was just above the tree tops. I looked at the road ahead and looked back really quick to see it had fallen below the tree lines by then and much larger than before. It was a lot closer to me by this time as though we were about to meet.  My heart sank, I blinked and it just vanished as if it went out. I pulled over onto the side of the road to investigate somewhat but there wasn't anything burning or on fire.  I never heard any noise.  The entire ordeal happened within a 30 sec time frame.
