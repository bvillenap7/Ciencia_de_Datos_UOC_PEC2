Two objects, saucer and cigar shaped, at 3,500 ft. moving north toward Chattanooga, Tenn.;1973-06-15 15:30:00;30 seconds;Two objects, saucer and cigar shaped, at 3,500 ft. moving north toward Chattanooga, Tenn I was 15 years old at the time.  My mother and I were sitting on the well deck (a deck around a well) behind my grandmother's house.  The house bordered highway 72.   I saw to the east a saucer shaped object in front, leading a large cigar shaped object.  Both were headed north toward Chattanooga, Tenn.  They were about 3,500 feet or less high.  Moving at about 200 to 300 mph.   Both were approximately three to four miles from my location.   Both moving over Sand Mountain from the south moving to the north.   That evening there were many reports on the Chattanooga news of UFO sightings.   I can only speculate at the exact month and date.  I know it was warm enough to be outside.  So April to October of 1973.;34.9464;-85.731
