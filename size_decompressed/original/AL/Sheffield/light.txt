If it was it was the first ever stationary star that i have ever seen move I was driving home and kept seeing a bright light in the sky in my peripheral vision.  I drove a couple more blocks still seeing the light in my peripherals, till my curiosity took over and I had to look and see what this bright light was. Once I looked and focused on the object, it looked like a stationary star but it was much brighter.  All of a sudden this object moved leaving a tail behind it.  This object seem to know that I saw it.  It didn't move till I looked.;34.7516;-87.7021
