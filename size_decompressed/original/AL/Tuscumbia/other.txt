I saw an red glowing arrowhead shaped object hovering in the sky.;2003-10-18 19:00:00;about 10 minutes;I saw an red glowing arrowhead shaped object hovering in the sky. Me my fiancee and her two children ages 5 and 7 were traveling westbound down HWY 72 to Cherokee,Al to do some star gazing bc I'm into amateur astronomy, it was around sunset and we both looked like at the exact same time and said what is that?...I saw a arrowhead shaped object with a redish glow, it was pointing directly up and was hovering in the sky at a fairly high altitude as we drove on it seemed to be getting lower to the ground and we were really curious at this point as to what it was.I pulled over into a church parking lot on the left side (opposite side of the hwy from the object) as I was getting out of my jeep the object rotated from vertical pointing towards the sky to horizontal facing south , I noticed there were kids playing in the church parking lot and I didnt want to have a bunch of people staring at me looking at this with my binoculars..I got back on the hwy and pulled over a quarter of a mile from the church into the Orba plant driveway I ran to the back to get my binoculars and the objects point swung around slowly and pointed at us...I finally got my binoculars out of the bag and was walking around to the side of the car to avoid getting hit by a car just as I got the binoculars out of the their case the object disappered. It didnt fly away, it didnt move at all, it just vanished.;34.6912;-87.6826000000001
