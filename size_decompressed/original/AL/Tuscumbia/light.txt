Big green light going toward the ground.;2015-09-12 19:45:00;1-2 seconds;big green light going twords the ground. I looked out my door and I was watching a few blinking lights that I had noticed towards Russellville and I seen this big ball of green light with a sort of trail of green light behind it just shoot twords the ground.  It only lasted a second or two.   I guess it was sort of southwest in the direction it was going but it was moving very fast and it didn't look like it was stopping until it hit the ground.   I seen this from Littleville, which is only about 10 miles from Russellville.;34.6912;-87.6826000000001
Flying stars?;2015-09-15 20:20:00;1-2 minutes;flying stars? I was sitting on my steps looking at some stars I didn't remember being in this area.  Then one by one they took off.  There was four of them.  I have seen this and other things a few times before but I noticed something different this time.   As I watched this one move northeast I noticed how slow it was going and then it's like it jumped super fast and slow back down.  It done this till it disappeared.   About a minute had passed I looked west in the sky and seen a bright golden light with a haze around it light up out of nowhere and start moving east.  It started to look like one of the first lights I seen and then disappeared.  Its a little cloudy tonight so I couldn't see anymore.;34.6912;-87.6826000000001
