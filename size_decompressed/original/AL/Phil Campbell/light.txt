Light in sky.;2016-11-01 18:30:00;3 minutes;Light in sky. Bright white light crossing sky 045 to 060 course from SSW to ENE.  Silent.  Looked just like ISS.  I thought it was the ISS, but my programmed alert didn't chime, realized this after object passed almost overhead.  I went online and verified ISS was not visible at time of sighting.  Estimated magnitude -2.5 to -3.  Much brighter than usual satellites other than Iridium flares or ISS.  It was probably reflected light as it faded rapidly in NNE direction like it passed into earths shadow.  No noticeable direction changes and light was very constant in intensity until rapidly fading as previously stated.  Probably a rather large orbital object.;34.3478;-87.7202
