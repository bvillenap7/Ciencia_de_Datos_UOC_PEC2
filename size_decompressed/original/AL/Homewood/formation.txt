I went out to smoke a cigarette at my apartment and was gazing at the moon, when suddenly lights appeared from the west at an instantaneous pace.  They were one behind the other in a line and came upon the city lights and seemed to stop and file into a V formation.  The within a second disappeared up and west again.  Then they were absent from sight.  Like if they were aircraft I have never seen any US aircraft move that fast and suddenly. I froze and gasped!  This was not of our planet unless there is another country far ahead of the US.  I believe they were from another planet just scoping.  I am not nuts.  I ignored it til I saw a film Forgotten Phoenix.   It was supposedly base on a true story about the Phoenix Lights.  OMG the footage whether real or not looked very much like what I saw in Birmingham, Alabama!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.4663;-86.808
