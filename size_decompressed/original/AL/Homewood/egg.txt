I am very disappointed in a lot of what is published on the internet ect, that's why I'm writing this report. origionally, I just met with the investigator(bill)at a waffel house in birmingham al at the time(my memory has always been foggy when it cames to dates and times- but not with events). So, if this does get published, I want to say that there is NO DOUBT in my mind asd to what I saw! I'll get to it, then say my thoughts on the matter on a whole. Driving twards birmingham al, on a slight up-hill twards a ridge(small to med height), a silver glowing object (substantially large) came over the crest at my 2-oclock and landed approx. where a mall area is. another went into the air and assended with great speed. To be more specific, it didnt go too far into the air(200-300 ft) before it really shot away!. what was comming twards me(the driver of the car didnt see it) was moving as if it had leaped the mountain top and came down very knowingly and controlled. I even saw the silver color hit the ground at the ridge. Therefor, I say it was 2 that i saw, though not at the same time. seemed like one came and the other left. I was very scared! i thought that a missle was comming or something. I don't know when the fear left and the realization began, but I sure didnt stop the car or tell the driver till we were well away. he was a bit mad about it, but I know better than to mess with what I dont know about. well, that's it. no weird dreams or sudden realizations of an antimatter energy.;33.4663;-86.808
