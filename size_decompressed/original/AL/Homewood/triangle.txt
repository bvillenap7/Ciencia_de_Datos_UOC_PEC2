Firework visitors.;2019-07-04 21:00:00;30;Firework visitors Triangular craft, red and blues lights--I believe we caught a side view of it.  It moved very swiftly back and forth, almost like a drone but much too fast, high, and clearly intelligent to have been one.  It would curve, hover, and dip in the air.  It looked as though it were watching the Vulcan that night as the fireworks went off, the entire time.  It would hover downward into the trees every now and again, only twice throughout the duration of time, and always either in a curved motion or a clean vertical hover. I have multiple videos of this experience.;33.4663;-86.808
