Object in the night sky moving in an irregular pattern.;1999-03-07 22:00:00;45 minutes;Object in the night sky moving in an irregular pattern. On the evening of March 7, 1999 I happened to step outside and look into the Eastern sky.  There were no overcast conditions and my attention was drawn to a lighted object which looked like any other star except that it moved in irregular patterns.  These patterns were a continuing sereis of short movements up, down, left and right with 90 degree turns.  Occasionally the object would move in a semicircular fashion.  When viewed through an 8 power binocular the object appeared no different than any of the many stars visible nearby.  The object first appeared approximately 40 degrees above the Eastern horizon. I called my next door neighbor, who is a NASA engineer, to confirm my sighting.  She observed the same object as I and had no explanation as to what it could possibly be.;34.3303;-86.4898
