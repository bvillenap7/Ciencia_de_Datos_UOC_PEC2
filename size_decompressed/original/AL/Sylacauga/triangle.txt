Orbs arranged in a triangular formation fly across the night sky.;2013-02-03 20:00:00;~5 minutes;Orbs arranged in a triangular formation fly across the night sky. This is an image I recreated of something my fiance and I saw. We both agree that this is an extremely accurate representation. The two smaller stars travel with the orange star from slightly behind and on each side. No sound, medium altitude, no flashing lights, clear night.  We saw this go from horizon to horizon at above-average airplane speed. The picture I made was as viewed from the front as it approached.  When it got over us the orange light seemed to have been attached to the front of the vehicle, shining forward, which would have become less visible as the front pointed more and more away from us.  It had two small, dim, orange lights on the bottom of it, (not pictured). Again, this is not an actual photograph of what we saw, but it is an extremely accurate representation we made.;33.1757894736842;-86.3020263157894
