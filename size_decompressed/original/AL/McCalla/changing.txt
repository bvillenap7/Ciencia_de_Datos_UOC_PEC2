August 4, 2009, I spotted in the night sky what first thought was a star.  ((NUFORC Note:  I suspect a twinkling star.  PD));2009-08-04 23:00:00;1 hour;On the night of August 4, 2009, I was on my back deck and just over the treeline in the distance I spotted in the night sky what first appeared to be a very bright star.  However, after closer observation with the naked eye and with binoculars also, it was obvious that the object pulsated white, red and green.  It hovered for a long time, and then moved very slowly sideways across the sky.  It moved up and down at times and appeared to change into a V shape too.  I watched with my son and daughter and my son's girlfriend for over an hour.  The object finally disappeared behind the trees where it was no longer visible to us.  Two even stranger things:  the neighborhood dogs were going crazy, and this is the same type object that I observed at the same time of night,in the same location and for over an hour on July 31st.
