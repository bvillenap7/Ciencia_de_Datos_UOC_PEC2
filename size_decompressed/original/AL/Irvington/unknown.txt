This happened back in 2012, and no one has ever believed me then I found this website. It was early morning around 3am and I was standing on my front porch having a smoke, when I heard a noise,it sounded like a squirrel or a really fast wild pig, when I looked that was not what I saw. I saw I large alien standing along the tree line it was white, very white all over, it had to stand at least 9 foot tall, its front legs were long at least 8 foot long not including its head and almost looked like elephant legs but slightly skinnier its torso and abdomen was a slightly flattened funnel shape leading down to it's rear legs that were only about 2 or 3 feet long. Its head was also kind of a funnel shape but more of an angled cylinder with a jagged bottom with no eyes that could be seen, it was fast moving along the edge of the woods and then appearing to look around almost like it was lost then at a right angle darted directly into the woods, 5 minutes later after hearing odd noises coming from the woods a large dimly glowing object shot straight up from about where! I saw the creature dart into the woods and the object eventually just disappeared from sight. The next day tracks of the creature were found and so was what looked like a landing site;30.4837;-88.2414
