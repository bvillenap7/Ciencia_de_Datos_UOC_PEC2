Three sets of light fading, and showing back up in different spots.;2011-11-16 08:00:00;Light in the sky;Three sets of light fading, and showing back up in different spots. Me and my wife walked out side, and i looked up in the sky and seen 2 orange lights.  One over the top of the other one, and they seemed to be hovering or floating.they slowly faded away, and a few minute's later one showed back up.  This time it was white, and it was in a different spot. It slowly faded away, after that 2 more showed back up.  They were orange again one over the top of the other. one of them stayed lit for about 30 seconds and slowly faded away again.  I have never seen anything like this.  At first I thought it was flares, but flares fall, and they dont change colors.  When we seen them we were facing south, and they were moving to the west.   A few minute's after the last lights faded away we heard a loud thundering sound.   It was one of the coolest things I have ever seen.;30.4837;-88.2414
Reddish orange lights fading and reappearing in different spots of the sky.;2011-11-16 20:00:00;5-10 mins;Reddish orange lights fading and reappearing in different spots of the sky. My husband and I live in Irvington, Alabama.  We were both outside at approximately 8:00pm.  I was working on some thing and my husband hollered at me to look in the sky.  We were facing south and right above the tree line in the sky I saw two reddish orange disc shaped balls of light.  They did not appear to be moving, but they slowly faded out.   So we stood there to watch, and they reappeared, but in a different spot just a little to the west of the first sighting.  The sky was clear so the weird thing is between the first and second sighting we herd a thunder like sound.  The lights faded and reappeared about 3 times within about 10 minutes.  That was the first time in my life I ever seen anything like that.  It was amazing!;30.4837;-88.2414
