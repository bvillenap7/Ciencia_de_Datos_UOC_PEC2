Bright light over Prattville, AL flashing and moving over tree line;2009-11-12 05:08:00;1 hour;Bright light over Prattville, AL, flashing and moving over tree line We saw a bright light in sky right above the tree line around 5:08 AM. It began moving right to left and moving upward at a slow speed.  It hovered there for a a few minutes moving right, left, up, and down flashing the bright light.   As the sun was coming up the light moved further up in the sky and had almost fully disapeared by 6:00 am.;32.6052;-86.4020999999999
Star like object traveling at super extreme speed covering most of the night sky, with a 2 second spotlight burst halfway in flight.;2014-08-26 20:30:00;15 seconds;Star like object traveling at super extreme speed covering most of the night sky, with a 2 second spotlight burst halfway in flight . Roughly about 8:30 pm CST, myself and my daughter were outside.  As I looked to the north, northwest and noticed the big dipper, I told my daughter about seeing the big dipper in that direction.   At that time, I observed a steady light, which appeared to be a star.  The star was stationary.  While observing the Big Dipper, this particular star started moving.  The star like object had no flashing lights and stayed luminescent the entire time myself and my daughter were observing it.   As i continued to watch, it seemed to move faster.  The lit object was traveling in an east, southeast direction.  There was no noise associated with this object. Myself and my daughter continued watching this object in flight.  In my opinion, and i have seen thousands of planes at night and the speed in which they move....this object traveled at a speed unknown to my eyes and probably 8 to 10 times faster than anything we have in our current military.   I could not guess the altitude in which the object was traveling.  But, it did appear at what some would call a possible normal cruising altitude for a commercial airliner.  As the object traveled about halfway across the sky, all of a sudden it emitted the brightest, most concentrated light i have ever seen in the sky, brighter than any full moon.  The light started as a concentrated beam, then it was as if it gazed directly down on my daughter and myself, then aimed away and off in roughly about 2 seconds.  The object then traveled on in an easterly, southeast direction.   It crossed the majority of the sky that I can see from my house in roughly a 15 second time frame.  The angle of travel I would guess, would be about 160 degrees to 170 degrees.  Almost a straight line from the North-Northwest, to the South-Southwest.  And I live next to a wide open field and can see the majority of the night sky.;32.6052;-86.4020999999999
