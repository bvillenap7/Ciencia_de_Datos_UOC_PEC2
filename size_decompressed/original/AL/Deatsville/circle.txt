I was on my back patio letting the dog out around 22:00 on July 10th, 2020. Very few clouds if any in the sky.  The stars were very brilliant.  I was looking up because I heard there was the possibility of seeing a comet in the sky this month.  A flash caught my eye and I saw the twinkle of a star.  It turns out something blocked the light from the star.  The was a black circle in the sky. Darker than the sky itself.  It was moving slowly northward.  I watched it for a couple of minutes.  I noticed a bright stream of light come from the west side of the object.  The light came out for only a second and it only happened a few times.  Maybe 4 or 5 times . It finally moved far enough away where I could no longer see it.;32.6052;-86.4020999999999
