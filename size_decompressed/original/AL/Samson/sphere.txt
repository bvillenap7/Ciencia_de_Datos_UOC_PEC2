Not a normal aircraft light array. I observed a solid light on the horizon moving rapidly from the South headed Due North.  It was at high altitude with no flashing white or red lights.  I am very familiar with helicopters and plans as we live in the middle of 2 bases one is a helicopter base the other is an air force base where they fly jets, ospreys, c-130s and other aircraft.  This object displayed none of the normal light arrays of standard aircraft.  The object moved in a relatively straight trajectory from south to north.  The sighting was approx. 3 min.  I attempted to video the object but it was too high and too dark to show up on my camera.;31.1089;-86.0672
