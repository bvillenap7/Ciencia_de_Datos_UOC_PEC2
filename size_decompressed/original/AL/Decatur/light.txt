Red, White, and Blue object, moving and gliding with sudun stops, below Orion's Belt. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2012-10-21 02:00:00;Now;Red, White, and Blue object, moving and gliding with sudun stops, below Orion's Belt. The object is/was beneath Orion's Belt more toward the horizon.  It seems to shine between reds, whites, and blues, dare I say some shifts of light directly at my location.  I want to say it's a planet, but I've been watching this thing weave back and forth and descending.  I won't claim it's anything unworldly and maybe being so close to the horizon the light had some drift causing this effect, but it was and is definitely new to me as an novice star gazer of over a decade...;34.5852333333328;-86.9921095238102
