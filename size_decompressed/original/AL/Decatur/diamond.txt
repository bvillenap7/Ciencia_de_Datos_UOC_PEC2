Strange orangish lights in sky, Alabamaâ€¦;2014-02-27 18:00:00;hours;Strange orangish lights in sky, Alabama... About twenty minutes before the sun goes down, I noticed two very bring objects which are a bright orange, sometimes changing to a darker less bright orange.   Then, as a aircraft flew  through the sky two  lights were seen...  The orange things seem to move together , and then sometimes they move separately.  And the sun went down and I took a moment to look up again, I see  the two brightest objects are more of a a red color.   I keep seeing these strange red an orange lights in this area, local need had no unrest in this however.   I am trying to find someone in my area who knows Moore about astronomy.;34.5852333333328;-86.9921095238102
