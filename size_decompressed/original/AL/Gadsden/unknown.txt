The bright white light from last night made a return appearance tonight.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2007-10-01 04:00:00;Still happening;The bright white light from last night made a return appearance tonight. My brother and I were walking around our neighborhood for our nightly mile, and on our final lap, we noticed that the UFO from last night was back again, in the same location, and at the same time of night. This led us to believe that this particular UFO is orbiting Earth.  The tiny flashing red dot flying near the large object had also returned, but it was higher and to the right of the object from our perspective.  We didn't bother watching for long, as we already knew what it does from its actions on the previous night. Again, it's still in the sky right now. ((NUFORC Note:  Star??
