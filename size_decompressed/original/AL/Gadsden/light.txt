My husband and I watched it just stay in one spot in the sky, then in the blink of an eye, it disappeared.   No sounds heard to indicate a helicopter suspended there.   Then last night, I saw the same apparent light south of us.  Fixed, not moving.  It was there for a long time, went to bed before it disappeared.  Tonight, it was not there.;34.0071952380952;-85.9432583333332
