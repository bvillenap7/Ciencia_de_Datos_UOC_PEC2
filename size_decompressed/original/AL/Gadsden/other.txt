A ILLUMINATING LIGHT SHOW, WITH BLUE SPHERES, AND ONE BRIGHT LARGE TRIANLED LT.;2005-12-01 18:00:00;1 1/2 HOURS;A ILLUMINATING LIGHT SHOW, WITH BLUE SPHERES, AND ONE BRIGHT LARGE TRIANLED LT. I WAS ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK WITH MY TWO YEAR OLD SON, AND SAW WHAT SEEMED TO BE A TRIANLED SHAPED LIGHT, CLOSE. I THOUGHT TO MYSELF I AM NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING,WHEN I PULLED INTO THE DRIVE, I WAS MET BY MY HUSBAND AND BROTHER. THEY WERE EXTATIC DID YOU SEE THE UFO?!! I GOT OUT AND LOOKED, IT WAS STILL THERE! I GOT SPOOKED A LITTLE. WE ARE ON THE COOSA RIVER, DARK AND A VERY CLEAR VIEW OF THE SKY. FOUR ADULTS, TWO CHILDERN SAT AND WATCHED A SPECTIULAR SHOW! NOT ONLY WAS THERE THE LARGE BRIGHT TRIANGLED SHAPED LIGHT, THERE WERE WHITE SPHERE SHAPED BALLS WITH A BLUE HUGE, THAT WERE JETTING ALL AROUND. AT ONE TIME WE COUNTED FOUR. WE SAW ONE OF THE SPHERE'S LOOKED AS IF IT WENT THROUGH THE BRIGHT TRIANGLE. THE SHERE'S WOULD MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE, UP AND DOWN, BE RACING AND COME TO A DEAD STOP. AS WE WATCHED WE SAW AIR CRAFT COMING AROUND, I'M NOT SURE IF THEY WERE INVESTIGATING THE LIGHTS IN THE SKY OR JUST NORMAL COMMERICAL. I WATCHED ONE OF OUR AIR CRAFTS COMING CLOSE TO THE BLUE SPHPERE, AND THE SHPERE LOOKED AS IF IT WAS TONTING OUR AIR CRAFT. AT ONE POINT I STARTED WORRING, THINKING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE 30 SECOUND SIGHTING? ANYWAY THIS WENT ON FOR AN HOUR, THEN THE TRIANGLE LIGHT WENT OFF NORTHWEST OVER THE MOUNTINGS, BUT THE SHERES STAYED AT LEAST THIRTY MINUTES AFTER. OUR FACES WERE GLUED TO THE WINDOW THE WHOLE TIME. AT ONE TIME I FELT SCARED, WAS THIS THE WAR OF THE WORLDS? (I'VE YET TO READ THE BOOK OR WATCH THE MOVIE) BUT IT WAS A SIRREAL FEELING. I KEPT MY CHILDREN CLOSE AND THE WINDOWS LOCKED.;34.0071952380952;-85.9432583333332
