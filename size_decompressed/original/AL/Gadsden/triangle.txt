It was moving very fast then came to complete stop then shoot in different direction.  I have pictures of craft.  Many people seen this and were talking about it on the way back to vehicles.  It was triangular with red lights on the corners and a bright blue light in the middle.  The bottom of the craft had some L looking markings and it was completely silent. When it stopped it caused some crazy looking vortexes before shooting off in different directions. Ever person I talked to seen it.  Not like you could miss it. It was very large and low in the sky.;34.0071952380952;-85.9432583333332
