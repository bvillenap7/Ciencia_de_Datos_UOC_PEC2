Lindsay and I sat on the dock in Riddles Bend over the dark waters of the Coosa River beneath a spray of stars, mystified.  I do not remember the moon.

Its light was brighter now, concentrated on the opposite shoreline like a spotlight.  A police cruiser, perhaps?  But it was so huge.  Maybe forty yards long.  And there was complete silence.
