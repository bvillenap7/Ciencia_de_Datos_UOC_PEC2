While taking my trash to the dumpster, I looked up because a light was in my peripheral vision and when I looked in that direction I noticed a cylinder shaped object with white light illuminating from it in 10+ sections.  It was stationary over hwy 278 and soon afterwards, it disappeared without a trace.  It must have been low to the Earth because it was huge.  It gave me the creeps, I ran in the house once it disappeared to call my mother about this strange phenomenon.
