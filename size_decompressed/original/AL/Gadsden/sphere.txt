3 ft. dia  tan colored spherical object manuveing at 120+ knts.;1978-08-15 15:30:00;10 Min.;3 ft. dia  tan colored spherical object manuveing at 120+ knts. I was piloting a Piper Cherokee 140 airplane returning to the Gadsden Airport after some recreational flying approaching from the north about 5 miles out, when I passed the object at about 1000 Ft. above ground level.  It was about 20 ft. off of my left wing.  It was about 3 feet in diameter, tan in color, and looked like a weather balloon except that it had no inflation nozzle, no radiosonde attached to it, and it was perfectly round.  Weather balloons have a teardrop shape to them when strapped to a weather gathering payload.  I circled back to get a closer look and noticed what appeared to be a red crecent moon or a hammer and scycle shape on it reminiscent of the emblem on the former Soviet flag.  As I circled around a second time to get closer look, the object moved away from me and maintained a distance of about 50 to 75 yard spacing between itself and my plane. When I became aware that the object could manuver, I was certainly rattled.   I tried to pursue the object about a minute or two but it accellerated away to the point that I could not keep up with it.  I was traveling at 120 knotts.   Scared, I opted to return to the Gadsden Airport.  When I arrived home, I reported the sighting to the Anniston Flight Service Station.  I believe the attendant at the FSS was unofficially impressed, but I don't know weather or not he officially filed my report.  I believe the UFO to be either alien, a Top Secret USA probe, or the Russians aren't telling us something.  I maintain that what I saw was not a weather balloon and flew under its own power.  I strongly believe the markings were used camoflage the UFO to be from Earth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));34.0071952380952;-85.9432583333332
White sphere witnessed by my nieces and orange ball witnessed by all of us on same day.;2010-11-17 04:30:00;about 15 min;White sphere witnessed by my nieces and orange ball witnessed by all of us on same day. I got a text message at about 9 am in the morning from 15 year old niece that she and her sister had just saw, and I quote freaky flying thing.   She later told me that out side of their house when they went to do their daily outside choirs that she saw three white balls about the size of soft balls that had a rotating light.  She then pointed it out to her sister who looked up and saw it too.  They said the objects were a little higher than the power lines and the just vanished right before their eyes.   Later I came over and I had them tell me the story because they know I’m interested in UFO’s and they both had drew pictures of what they saw.  One was 15 my other niece who saw it was 16 at the time. Later that day around 4:30, I had them ride with me to go do some work at my storage space and one of them screams what is that?”  So I pull over and we all look out the window and see what appears to be a big orange light in the sky.  It appeared to be hovering at first but then we noticed that it was moving steadily but very slowly.  Then we noticed some ways away three jets were heading towards it.  I decided to drive up the road to see if I could get a better look at what we were seeing and we lost sight of it.   So I turned around and went back to same spot as before and the object was still there but there was no sign of the jets.  We didn’t see what happened but they were gone.   After a while we lost sight of the orange ball as it seemed to move off into the distance.   I just want to add, I’ve seen weather balloons and I’ve seen Venus and this wasn’t either. The girls I couldn’t believe what we had seen.  We went on to the storage space and continued to talk about what we saw.;34.0071952380952;-85.9432583333332
