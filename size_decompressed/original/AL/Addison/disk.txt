Large, colorful disk shaped ufo over Addison.;2008-04-23 01:30:00;Less than 5 min.;Large, colorful disk shaped ufo over Addison. I woke up between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. due to a strange pulsating feeling that I had. I then went to the kitchen and drank a glass of water, hoping to shake the feeling and go back to bed. For whatever reason I decided to step out of the side door on the southern side of my home and saw a large disk shaped object in the hovering over a cow pasture in the southeast direction from my position. I estimated it to be about fifty yards across, and hovering about 150 yards above the ground. It had several large lights in a ring formation around the bottom of the craft that were glowing with an intensity that I liken to a very high powered hps light bulb. The colors of the lights are what astounded me though, they were extremely rich and saturated looking and were displaying changing colors that I can't even begin to describe. The craft itself didn't really make any sounds, it just had a strange pulse that it seemed to give off. Almost as soon as it had started, the craft shot up at about a 45 degree angle and cut back to my left before disappearing into the darkness. I've always been skeptical about the whole ufo thing, and honestly, had I been asked yesterday afternoon if I thought such a thing really existed I probably would have been unsure, leaning more towards no.;34.209;-87.1967
