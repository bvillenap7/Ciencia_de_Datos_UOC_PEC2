It was only lightnig but we thought it was like having our own free fire works display. We could still see the stars above us but the lightning storm was all around our city with just this clear spot in the middle. After watching the storm for a while we both noticed what looked like a car with its high beams in the sky off to the north east. It moved our way slowly and made no noise until it was right above us. It was a triangle shaped object with two bright lights on the front. It also had three white lights in a cirlce on the underneath with one red light in the center. It was about 45 to 50 feet off the ground and travelling very slow. There was no sound until it was right above us. It headed in a southwest direction at a slow pace (too slow for an airplane). I used to be in the army and I know the sounds of both airplanes and helicopters and the hum from this craft was not the same. As soon as it went back into the storm clouds two strange things happened. The wind, which was not blowing before pick up and started blowing at a high rate and within a minute after it disappeared the storm just stopped. when it passed right over my wife and I we both made out it's shape becuase the lights on the bottom lit up it' outline and the sky was clear right above our heads.;34.9486;-86.5944
