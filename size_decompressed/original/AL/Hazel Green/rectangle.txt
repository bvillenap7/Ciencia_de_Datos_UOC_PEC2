After 5 seconds, it quickly went straight up and disappeared. Walking my dog as usual at this time.  I happened to look up and there it was.  It was hovering, being still in one place.   All of a sudden, it quickly took off, straight up and disappeared.  The object was quite far up and how long it was there, I don't know.  It was silver-white with two dark narrow lines on each side of the rectangle.   I had watched it for about five seconds, before it went up.  Very strange.   I could not find anyone else who had seen this, but found your website.   Thank you!   The time was about 9 pm, June 24, central time.  It made no sound or emitted any lights.  I ruled out drones and planes.  Direction was north-east of my house.;34.9486;-86.5944
