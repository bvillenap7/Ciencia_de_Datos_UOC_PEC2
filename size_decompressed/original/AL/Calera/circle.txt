Moved very slowly to the west, then disappeared. At first glance.  It had the features of a planet that was close enough to earth that the color was noticeable with the eye.  That's what got my attention.  It appeared stationary.  The orange/red color was very noticeable.   When I obtained and returned with binoculars, I notice the seconded color of blue or green.  I thought I was seeing the planet Saturn or Jupiter.  I stopped looking for 1-2 minutes, then came back and took another look and saw that it was no longer at its original location.   I looked farther west and picked it back up again, only smaller and harder to see.  It faded out before the horizon,not past the horizon.  Object was moving almost due west from the east.
