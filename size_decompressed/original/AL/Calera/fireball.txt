Orange glowing fireball over central Alabama.;2014-07-06 20:45:00;2 minutes;Orange glowing fireball over central Alabama. Was outside when over the horizon appeared an orange glowing object that looked to be on fire.  Moved incredibly fast over the sky.  It looked triangular in shape at first.  Made absolutely no sound.  Looked to be climbing higher and higher before flickering out in the sky.   Called my wife out to see.  After some research, I don't think this is a chinese sky lantern, which was my first thought.  The speed of the object was incredible.  Eerily consistent with the recent reports on your website. I have no experience in aircraft or any military experience but I have traveled tens of thousands of miles across the country and have not seen anything remotely like this.   After doing some quick research it seems a lot of these reports come around July 4th.  Not just this year, but in every year before this.  Again, very strange!;33.1063;-86.7583000000001
