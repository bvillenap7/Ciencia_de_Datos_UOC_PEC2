There were 5 lights, mid way up the tree line there was a green light then 400ft.away in a line was a red light , with two lights in the center of it all one white one multi colored they stayed an equal distance apart . Till I dove into my brothers drive with the car pointing right at it.  I flashed the bights of the car at it. Then the red and green lights  came together as if to focus  on me?  Then  a second later they went back to the the 400ft  gap as before...it scared me so I went back down to the next house and watched them as it  move off to the west then disappeared from sight for a few mins.   There was  a single bigger white light that came up over the trees  increased slightly in brightness then disappeared.  I slept in a motel that nite, it was very weird..  There were many sighting around here in the 90s, so I've heard.  I had  found a coyote a fox an a deer layed side by side  opened up with no  blood or trck near by, also the man who has cattle on this property has had 4 calves disappear this year so far.   The land is on a point with cliffs on 3 sides of it the is no access from the rear. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the gentleman who submitted this report, and we found him to be quite credible and sober-minded.  He emphasized how dramatic the sighting was, and the emotional effect it had on him.  PD));34.6074;-85.9088
