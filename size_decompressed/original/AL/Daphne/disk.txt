Disk above Daphne AL, accompanied by a light.;2007-10-21 03:00:00;all night;Disk above Daphne AL, accompanied by a light. It was directly over head and was saucer looking from where I stood and had 4 black circles on the bottom, but it looked like a circle (hope you know what I mean). Also it left a green and blue trail behind it... but right before we saw it we all saw a strange flash so we looked up(thinking it was lighting) and there it was. Also all night we observed what looked like a star except for the fact it kept moving to different spots (this is the rreason we were outside in the first place when we saw the blue and green squiggle). Im sorry if this seems out of order but I left this out: the saucer we saw left a green and blue squiggle trail behind it which is how we knew it wasn't an asteroid or meteor.;30.6230839285714;-87.8957053571429
