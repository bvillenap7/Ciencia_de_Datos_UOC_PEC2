Blue/Red/Green flashing object above Mobile, Al.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?  PD));2008-11-02 23:00:00;30 minutes or more;Blue/Red/Green flashing object above Mobile, Al. I was outside last night watching the stars when I saw one that appeared to be flashing Blue/Green/Red lights. I thought it was a plane or chopper, yet, after quite some time, it never moved. I watched it for around 30 minutes. Tonight (the next night) I went outside to see if it was a tower or anything else, and it is not in the sky tonight. It was too far out to make out any type of shape. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?  PD));30.6230839285714;-87.8957053571429
