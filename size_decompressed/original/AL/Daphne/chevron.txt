Chevron shape lights moving slowly, Daphne AL;2010-10-12 19:13:00;45 sec;Chevron shape lights moving slowly, Daphne AL Walking to my car on my way to a Mason meeting (meaning sober) I sighted something directly overhead on a bearing of 220 ne-sw.  At first glance I thought it was Jupiter between two stars then I remembered Jupiter was in the east right now.  I stared at it and realized it was moving, rather slowly, as were the two other two objects beside it. the shape was of a chevron with a very bright object in front ( appeared slightly larger that Jupiter right now and as bright white or slightly brighter than Sirius) with the other 2 less bright ( slightly yellow or just dimmer ) to either side the formation pointing 220 degrees s-sw. the whole formation moved about 3 to 1/2 ft. in the visual plane in 45 seconds...I ran inside ( 20 ft ) yelled for my family to come see and by the time I went back out the object had disappeared, that was about 10 seconds or less. No solid object observed.  No noises associated with the sighting.  Skies clear, slight breeze, 75 F ambient temp.

Lifelong astronomy enthusiast and avid sky watcher...with only one other questionable sighting - not reported in thousands of hours sky watching over a lifetime.;30.6230839285714;-87.8957053571429
