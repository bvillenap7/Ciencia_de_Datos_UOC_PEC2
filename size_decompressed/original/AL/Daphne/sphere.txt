Very reflective or pulsating white light seen above Daphne AL in broad daylight.;2020-08-08 13:00:00;few minutes;Very reflective or pulsating white light seen above Daphne AL in broad daylight. Around 1pm I saw a very reflective object move across the sky. I thought it was an airplane but as I continued to observe the object it became very clear it was not an airplane or metallic balloon. It either kept reflecting the sun or it was pulsating a white light . I watched it for about 5 mins and it went behind a cloud and vanished.;30.6230839285714;-87.8957053571429
