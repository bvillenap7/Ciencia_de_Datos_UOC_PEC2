I play bass in a classic rock band, and had just left our studio when I saw what I thought was a small plane through the trees, over the east end of the Bay Bridge on Mobile Bay.  Just a couple of red and white lights.  As I drove the approx. 3/4 mile to the bridge, I caught glimpses of it through the trees until I turned north on a parallel street to Hwy 98, expecting to get a good look at it. It wasn't there.  Now, this is the weird part.  The second I thought 'Well, where the h...', it flared bright, just long enough for me to see it, then dimmed to the way it had been at first, right over the center of the street about 1/4 mi. away and maybe 500 ft. high.  It was two concentric circles of round lights, the whole craft about the size of a nickel at arm's length, the outer ring was 7 or 8 red lights with an inner ring of 5 or 6 white lights, non-rotating, no movement, no sound.  I lost sight of it for about 20 - 30 sec. turning west, then north coming up to the bridge, then I looked east down I-10 and it was almost out of sight, moving FAST toward Pensacola.  In 25 sec, it had traveled close to 8 miles, that works out to around 1,200 m.p.h.!  No small feat, and apparently no small plane either.;30.6230839285714;-87.8957053571429
