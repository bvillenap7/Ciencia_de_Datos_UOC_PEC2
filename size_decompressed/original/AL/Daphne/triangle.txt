Triangular shaped object with 3 lights, passes over house at low altitude and made no sound.;1995-11-01 22:30:00;30 seconds;Triangular shaped object with 3 lights, passes over house at low altitude and made no sound. After returning home late from a social event my wife and I saw an object pass over our house after I parked the care and we were walking from the car to the house. There were 3 lights that appeared to be at the points of a triangular shaped object. The size of the object was hard to estimate but it appeared to be very low when it passed over our house whithout making any sound. If the object was at a high altitude then it was gigantic in size, but I would guess it was only about 100 feet over the house and if this guess is correct then it was about half a football field in size. It was a clear night with a lot of stars visable so as this object passed over it blocked out the stars between the 3 points of light at it's 3 corners. This is why I say the object was triangular in shape. I have never reported this sighting before but I feel it is the same type of object recently seen in Texas.
