Daytime object caught on video;2006-12-02 12:15:00;2 minutes;Daytime object caught on video I was out in the backyard watching my dogs play. I had taken along my camcorder to catch some video of the dogs.  Walking to the far NE corner of the yard I stood under a small oak tree. The limbs of the tree blocked the sun from my view which was midway in the southern sky. Thats when I noticed the object in the sky.  It sat SSE of my position at a 45 degree angle up and I quickly turned my camcorder on the object and took just over a minute of video before loosing sight of the object.  It appeared to be oval in shape.It also appeared to be self lit. The object made no noise.The dogs did not react in any way to the object.The weather was clear that day as seen in the video.Having worked at the Mobile airport for a number of years re-fueling all commercial and freight Aircraft I can tell you this was no plane.
