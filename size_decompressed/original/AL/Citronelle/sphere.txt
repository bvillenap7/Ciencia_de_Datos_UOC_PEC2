Chrome Sphere and mind control?;2008-12-21 19:30:00;30 seconds;Chrome Sphere and mind control? I was on Highway 45N going to Mississippi and I was a few miles south of Citronelle, Al in a very rural area. I glanced outside the car window and saw a amazingly shiny sphere with a highly polished chrome appearance floating about 2-3 feet over a pasture area. It was approximately 30 feet from the road. A thought entered my head that it was a Mylar balloon but it was so spherical and so still that I immediately rejected that thought. Then a thought entered my head again that it was ornamental gazing ball that are seen in peoples yards. I again rejected that thought because it was a pasture with no houses for several miles. When I rejected that thought I felt like something left my mind!! And I had empty feeling in the base of my skull. It is very hard to explain. I have never had such a feeling. It seemed that it was suggested to me what the object was and when I rejected those thoughts it left my head. I am 49 year old female with an executive position in a large company. I have told no one about the experience. Weather conditions: high 30's, light wind. There wasn't any lights in the area and the stars were bright and clear.
