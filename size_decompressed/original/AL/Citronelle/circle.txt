The lights would even change color. From white to yellow and then a blueish green colored. Took a picture of it and called my neighbor and we went out in our back yard and watched it hovered away back in our field.  I never believe in UFOs til tonight.  100% positive it wasnâ€™t a satellite by the way it was moving. We have a cow pasture next to us and while this was going on they were making really loud  strange noises like they were scared. All this started At 11:15pm central time.;31.0427;-88.2534
