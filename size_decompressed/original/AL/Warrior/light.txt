November 21, 2000 at 5:07AM I looked out my second floor bathroom window facing East and noticed the moon and stars in a clear sky.  I noticed a bright object to the North East traveling in a South West direction that was a very bright white light.  I would estimate the object had to be at an altitude of 8,000 to 10,000 feet and 2 to 3 miles from my viewpoint.   I assumed it was an airplane but the object was going pretty fast, faster than an airpane.  At this point I thought it might be a shooting star but the object had a pulsating bright white light not leaving a trail behind it. The object suddenly stopped for a few seconds then the glowing became very dim and dropped at a slight angle to the ground.  It went out of sight behind the hills and trees for a few seconds then it moved back up to the position it dropped altitude from, began to glow bright again then took off in a climbing direction in the South East direction at a faster speed than before.  It went out of sight in about five seconds. I also noticed two aircraft in the sky at this time.  I know that these pilots had to see this object. I have seen many shooting stars but have never seen one stop, fall to the ground, then return to the sky and take off again.  Got any ideas what I saw?;33.8529;-86.8198000000001
Large non-blinking light over Warrior, Alabama.;2014-09-17 20:00:00;1 minute;Large non-blinking light over Warrior, Alabama Seen one very large bright light moving South.  This object was too low and moving too fast to be an airplane.  There were no blinking lights or sound.;33.8529;-86.8198000000001
