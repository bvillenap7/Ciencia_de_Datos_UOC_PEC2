((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter Davenport.  You are correct.  Full disclosure since you were so kind to reply.  I reported this on behalf of the eye witness. (a relative who wishes to be anonymous).  After a second conversation, I understood that the relative sent the photos to me at 21:00.  The photos were actually taken at 19:30, 5.7.2017.   The eyewitness says the track of the object was up and northerly. looking at a map from Warrior Alabama they stated it was on track to eventually go over New York State.  The eyewitness is currently a ((title deleted)) a School  and has been in the teaching profession.  Very familiar with natural science, including weather patterns.   The object was in view as she was taking out the trash and remained in view long enough for her take the two still photos with her iphone so the total view time was close to 30 seconds.  She is willing to do a hand drawing of the object as it was seen by the eye as she claims it looked closer to classic UFO shape.   If there is any further information about the viewing of the object I will be happy to forward to you.  I will take in to consideration contacting local press about further witnesses.  Once again, Peter, thank you for your very kind personal reply. ((END ADDENDUM));33.8529;-86.8198000000001
