I have driven well in excess of a million miles, have over 4,000 hours flight time and had never seen an object which I could not explain until I saw this one.  This unidentified airborn object had no tail of debris such as that of a meteor.  It was a bluish white like the light of a xenon strobe. It did not flash, rather it pulsed off like a strobe pulses on.  It looked like a plasma sphere.  I have no way to perceive it's distance nor it's size.  It was in excess of 2,000 feet away, as it passed behind trees which were at least that far away.  Interestingly, I mentioned this to two other people an hour or so later, and one of them had seen what he described as the same type thing seen at the same time I saw it, yet he was 25 miles East of my location.  For all I know we could have been the same object at some distance, since he and I both saw it in the NNE.;33.593513114754;-86.3410229508196
