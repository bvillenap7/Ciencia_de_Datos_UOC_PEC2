A fishing trip ends with a loud roar and a bright light waking me up in the night.;1997-03-15 01:30:00;10 minutes;A fishing trip ends with a loud roar and a bright light waking me up in the night. I was taking my normal spring break fishing trip at our lake house south of Pell City, near the Coosa River.  The best way to explain this is to explain the lay of the land a bit.  The property has a steep drive downward to the house.  Being fairly remote in the woods, trees are everywhere and right against the driveway.  We had wooden steps going up to the 'front door' of the house and the wooden porch continued and wound around to the actual front of the second floor of the house.  Above those steps on the top (Second) floor is the window of the room I was sleeping in.   I woke up in the middle of the night just after midnight.  Light was flooding the room.  There was a noise very loud.  Is was a roaring near deafening roar like that of a jet engine.  What in very unusual about this, is the lighting.  It seemed to come from everywhere.  I never moved.  I barely breathed.  I was simply struck with fear as if someone was searching for something or someone.  At first, I thought it was a truck from the street, but that did not match up.  If a car was on the drive way it would have to be a good ways behind the house to even attempt to angle the headlights into the window of my room which was parallel with the driveway.   There was another mystery, the noise.  I remember thinking, maybe it's the police looking for someone.  But that did not make sense either, because they would be using a helicopter over the forest.  What ever it was, was not making the normal whup-whup of a helicopter.  This was a loud roar.  Though I could not see it, I seriously felt as if it was below the tree line in order to highlight the window.  The trees were too high by the house for any helicopter to safely be right above with all the trees around it.  It seemed to stay a long time, which ended up being around 10 minutes simply shining a very bright light on the whole house and through the window right above my head.  This will sound very odd, but it seemed! as if the house was 'being scanned' though no effects or any other lighting was seen.  I remember being simply too scared to move, and too scared to breathe.  I remember thinking thought, There is no one here.   I cannot say for sure, but it felt as if I was hearing other thoughts within my own.  I really expected to see something walk right down the hallway.  Though I never heard walking on the porch, it was as if the idea was placed there like 'we should'.  Though I never left the bed, I felt as if my perception was changing in some way.  It was very strange.  It was as if this mystery craft was right next to the house hovering above the street and below the tree line.  I distinctly remember thinking to myself, If I don't breathe maybe they will go away.  I was saying the Lord's Prayer, and other silent prayers, and trying so hard to not breathe.  Here is the rub, that made me go, What the?  The roar became even louder, and then the craft or whatever it was, was simply gone.  It left almost instantaneously! .  The Doppler Effect was almost missing here, thought I heard it 'leave'.  There was no hearing anything lift off.  No tires crunching the gravel or concrete.  It went from being there, to simply not being there.  I had the hardest time going back to bed that night afterwards.  The next morning I checked the porch and the tree branches hanging over the driveway.  Everything seemed normal.  What woke me up that night, I am still completely clueless.  I never stayed up there alone to go fishing after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.
