Very high, cigar shaped UFO moving at incredible speeds.;2008-10-01 11:00:00;5 Min.;Very high, cigar shaped UFO moving at incredible speeds. Around the date of October 1st, 2008, I witnessed a very distant object very high up. It might have been an airplane, however, do to the altitude I'm not sure.  Another reason I'm skeptical it was a UFO is because it was moving at incredible speeds. If it was at normal airplane altitude it would be going as fast as a stealth bomber.  It seemed to be white without any wings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.593513114754;-86.3410229508196
