Bright silver object that just vanished in the sky.;2013-05-07 18:00:00;5 minutes;Bright silver object that just vanished in the sky. My daughter and I were getting onto the interstate and I noticed a very BRIGHT silver object in the sky.  It looked unusual so I pulled over and we started watching it.  It was a football shaped bright metal object that was moving across the sky.  It was not leaving anykind of smoke or any kind of trail behind it.  We saw it for about 2 minutes when it suddenly just vanished.  It was a CLEAR blue sky when no clouds.  We saw nothing fall out of the sky and we sat for at least 2 more minutes looking to see if it would show up again.  It was a very exciting moment.  We would both thrilled to have seen it!!!!;33.593513114754;-86.3410229508196
