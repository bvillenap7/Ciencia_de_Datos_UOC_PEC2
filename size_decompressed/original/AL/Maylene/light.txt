Light, orb sighting in middle Alabama, 2002;2002-12-15 00:00:00;10-15 seconds;Light, orb sighting in middle Alabama, 2002 Growing up I wanted more than anything to be an amatuer astronomer, at 12 I started to nightwatch and would do so on my back porch for atleast and hour every night during winter months. On one of the coldest nights of December in 2002 I witnissed a light which looked like a star I had missed at first but I noticed it was slowly moving beyond the trees so I kept an eye on it to see if it was an aircraft becuase I enjoyed watching planes as well.  It was bigger and more pronounced than the stars around it and suddenly darted north, southwest, then southeast beyond the trees. I was quite scared went inside and never mentioned it again until a year later. I had drawn a picture immediatly afterward but it has went missing since. I don't think I will ever forget that night.
