TRIANGLE IN THE SKY WITH 3 ORANGE GLOWING ORBES AT EACH POINT. LEEDS ALABAMA JUNE 2015;2015-06-09 10:00:00;1 minute;TRIANGLE IN THE SKY WITH 3 ORANGE GLOWING ORBES AT EACH POINT. LEEDS ALABAMA JUNE 2015 I was pulling out of my driveway located on HWY 119 aka Montevallo Road headed into Leeds around 10PM to check on my husband at our office.  As soon as I look in front of me above the highway near Callaway's Country Store I see a triangle made from 3 glowing orange orbs.  The closer I became to this object the further it moved away.  I could not believe what I was seeing and of course I wanted to take a picture of it.  I could tell that it was moving farther away from me by the second.   By the time I had my camera ready on my phone and snapped the picture my flash was on and the reflection from my windshield made it nothing more than a bright flash of course.  And instantly, it was gone. Instantly. It did not move like anything I had ever witnessed.  It moved almost in an up, down, side to side manner, swiftly.  I continued to drive around for at least another hour just trying to see it again.  I'll never forget that evening or the events that took place up until present day.;33.5283000000004;-86.5748000000005
