4 person, 6 sec sighting of a slow streaking flare/meteorite type object that disappeared and reappeared before passing nearby horizon.;2004-04-05 23:30:00;6 sec;4 person, 6 sec sighting of a slow streaking flare/meteorite type object that disappeared and reappeared before passing nearby horizon. This evening, four witnesses observed a reddish orange flare-type object travel from roughly 30 degrees west-east past horizon at 10-20 miles distance for six seconds. The object streaked down slowly in similar fashion to flares I've seen in the northern Arizona desert, although it did not appear to be burning up like a fireball which eminates and emits an aural haze, it looked more uniform like a meteorite with a tail. The object was observed from 0-1 seconds for about 10 degrees when it disappeared for 2 seconds and reappeared at 3-6 seconds to the treetop horizon. I had a very good view of the object because I was obseving that exact part of the beautiful, clear evening sky at the time it appeared directly in my line of vision. The best way that I can describe the way in which it traveled was that it appeared to me as though it had been dropped. It's brightness was that of Jupiter, and it did not seem as though it burned up before it impacted or landed roughly 10 miles away. It's behavior seemed so unusual to us that we all immediately acknowledged it and joked that the aliens were landing in Leeds, Alabama.  We are MJ- age 30, April- 24, Brandi- 20, Crystal- 18, co-workers who had stopped at April's house after work to visit, and we observed the object as we were leaving to take everyone home.  If needed, as a digital imaging specialist and multimedia developer I can provide detailed longitudal bearing and locale via email using graphics or animation.
