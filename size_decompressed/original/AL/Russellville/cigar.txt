White Cylindriacal Cigar type object moves sluggishly in the northern sky.;2014-03-10 14:35:00;4-5 minutes;White Cylindriacal Cigar type object moves sluggishly in the northern sky. Traveling North on Co. Rd. 49, crossing Britton Bridge over Cedar Creek , with my daughter, I saw a white/silver, cylindrical object that appeared to be hovering stationary in the sky well above the tree line, about seven fingers from the horizon. Finding a place to pull over and stop the car, I watched as this elongated object moved slowly from general west.  It moved to slow to be an airplane and there was no sound emitted as jets and planes make (even when they are not visible).  In fact, during this time I neither heard nor saw any known air crafts.  Also, there was not a cloud in the sky. I watched for perhaps three to four minutes as it moved in a lazy fashion across the sky for at least six hand widths at arms length. I had time to notice that it did not taper to a near point at either end (as planes and helicopters do) but instead was rounded.  Not a hard semi-circle round, but a softer hill type round.  It also appeared to be long, (like a stretched blimp maybe), as well as narrow, (like a used up, shortened pencil). I continued watching it travel eastward and in the blink of an eye, below this object and to the left, another object appeared suddenly.  It too was elongated and white in color. Only the ends of the second object appeared to be flat and it moved from east to west.  It too moved slowly. They both appeared to be large and a good distance away.  I would estimate their angle of elevation to be around 45 degrees or a little less.;34.49835;-87.702175
