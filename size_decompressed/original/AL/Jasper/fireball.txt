White/Orange color sphere seen in Alabama;2003-07-07 17:30:00;1- 2 minutes;White/Orange color sphere seen in Alabama My daughter and I were on our way home from a friends house.  We were following my father whom was driving ahead with my 2 sons and nephew in his pick up truck.  My 2 sons were in the back of his pick up,(they were wet from swimming).  As we were driving my daughter whom was age 4 at the time say hey dad, look at the sun.  I was driving to the west and the sun was still high.  I looked and she was pointing North.  I looked to see what she was pointing at and saw a white/organge sphere which was very bright and all I can compare it to is the Sun.  It was the size of the moon at midnight, which was impressive to me because is alitude was below 5000 ft and no more than a 1/2 mile away over a large Cattle pasture. I stared at this for a good 15 seconds. I had to remind my self I was driving.  I told my daughter to keep her eye on it for me (it appeard motionless) while I pulled over.  She said ok, and as I was finding a spot to pull over, my daughter says its gone. I quickly looked and it was.  I asked her where did it go.  She goes up. I asked her to point and she pointed straight up.  We arrived at our home and as I got out of the car my boys whom were in the back of my dad's truck says, dad did you see that bright light in the sky (boys ages are 6, 12).  I said yea, describe it to me, and they repeated the same as my daughter and I saw and also confirmed it went up when it left.  My dad was unbuckling my nephew (age 4) from his car seat, while the boys were telling me what they saw.  I walk over and asked him if he seen anything curious on the way home.  He and my nephew at the same time started talking about it as well.  They described the same as everyone else, my dad used the term sun because my nephew refered to it as the sun like my daughter.  I was totaly amazed at what we saw.  I was even more amazed how there was 6 of us who saw it, 2 in the cab of truck, 2 in back of truck, and 2 in seperate car, whom all seen and described the same thing.;33.8327992031872;-87.267601593626
