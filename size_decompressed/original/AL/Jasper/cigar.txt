Cigar shaped, iridescent craft. Soundless...seen over Jasper,AL;2009-05-17 11:00:00;10 minutes approx.;Cigar shaped, iridescent craft. Soundless...seen over Jasper,AL My friend and I were on the walking track in front of Walker Regional Medical Center. We were talking, walking slowly, just killing time and he pointed to the sky in the distance (I'd say about a half a mile away) at treetop level and said Do you see wings on that plane?  I looked up and saw a cigar shaped thing in the sky...it wasn't moving like any airplane I've ever seen...it sort of hovered, going forward and drifting backward and side to side in no particular order, it just hung in the sky sort of. We watched it begin to move forward at a slow rate and moved ourselves to the middle of the track to get a better look...when we got there it was gone completely. I said something like we lost it and my friend said, loudly there it is  and pointed directly over our heads.We heard no sound, none of the distinctive trails that accompany airplanes...nothing.  It was the same shape, still hovering and an iridescent color...vaugely pink, sort of silver-metallic....kind of an indefinite shape, still cigar shaped but the edges weren't really defined, like a glob of mercury (if you can imagine...sounds crazy, I know)this time it was much higher in the sky than before. We stood  transfixed for about 5 minutes as it slowly drifted into one direction and was gone from our sight. We both sat down on a bench and asked each other what we thought it was, can you believe it?! and all that stuff. Suddenly the silence was broken by the sound of a jet roaring overhead, going in the direction of the thing in the sky.
