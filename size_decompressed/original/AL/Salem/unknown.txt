Sighting on Lake Harding in East Alabama.;2015-05-09 20:45:00;5 minutes;Sighting on Lake Harding in East Alabama Lake Harding (located on the Alabama/Georgia State line in East-Central Alabama) I walked out on my front porch.  I observed an odd light and watched to see what it was.  It became obvious it was NOT an airplane.  The light(s) color was a red-orange and appeared to be multiple lights.  There was no flashing, or green, light as exhibited in an airplane.  I walked back to the door and told my husband I was looking at something that didn’t look like an airplane.   I returned to my original position and still observed the odd lights.  I walked off my porch into the yard and it changed direction to the west.  It had originally been approaching from a south-southwest direction.  As I walked off my front porch, the lights became very small and vanished in an instant. Background:  I worked in the local District Attorney’s Office for 32 years before retiring.   After taking a year off, I decided to use my real estate license, obtained in 2008, and have been working as a Realtor® for the past 4 years.  I have been a Board Member on the Opelika Chamber of Commerce as well as the National Association for Justice Information Systems.  I have lived on Lake Harding, a tributary of the Chattahoochee River, for 16 years.   My husband indicated, after I explained what I saw, that he has seen similar activity in the past. I want them to come back so I can talk to them!;32.6194;-85.1841
