Saw orange glowing balls of fire above Theodore.;2014-04-25 22:30:00;5 minutes;Saw orange glowing balls of fire above Theodore. Me and my husband were driving north on US 90 at approximately 10:30pm. I was driving so I saw it first.   As we were approaching Theodore Dawes and US 90 red light I saw a formation of orange glowing lights/balls of fire hovering.  As we got closer they began to disperse and three moved off in another direction and one hovered above our vehicle about 100ft up for about 7-10 seconds as we sat at the light.  I had my head out of the drivers window looking up at it for the full 10 seconds while the light was red.   It was in a circle shape but not perfect, kind of like a ball of gas that was burning but not out of control, it was like a forcefield or entity.  Looked as if you could touch the object but it may not have been completely solid.  It's hard to explain the texture of what I saw.  As the light turned green I had to drive so I started forward but I could still see this orange glowing ball of fire in my side mirror.   It moved in a very controlled manner and sort ! of glided.  It also changed direction and hovered. As I continued north on 90 I saw the object in my rear side mirror until the trees obstructed it so I'm not sure if it just disappeared or flew away.  I have never seen anything in my life I cannot explain except for this.;30.5408769230769;-88.1863923076923
Slow moving, soundless, smokeless fireball in the early am sky.;2014-07-19 02:00:00;5-6 minutes;Slow moving, soundless, smokeless fireball in the early am sky. My husband and I were in the front porch @ 2:00 am.  I was the first to see this fireball thing, it was going straight up and then was gone.   I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me because hadn't got a lot of sleep and was really tired.  I asked him if he saw it and he looked at me like I was crazy.   I ran out into the yard to see if I could spot it again so he followed me still saying I was crazy.  All the sudden the look on his face changed and I knew he had spotted it.  Out of nowhere the fireball was back moving slowly and soundless above the tree in our yard.  It kept in a straight line moving across the sky and away from us.   Within a matter of minutes it disappeared into the clouds.  It seemed to be only 50 maybe 60 feet above us and we both got a very clear look at it.  It had a clear like see through center and covered in fire, no sound, no smoke, no hurry just a steady pace.  I never believed the things I heard about UFOs until now, still go outside in the early part of the mornings just in hopes to see it again!!!   Strangest thing I've ever seen and yet beautiful in a way. ((NUFORC Note:;30.5408769230769;-88.1863923076923
