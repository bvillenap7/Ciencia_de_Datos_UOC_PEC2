All of a sudden, we see a light moving at a high speed across the sky.  We tried to capture it on his camera but we couldn't see anything because of the darkness.  It was very dim and not blinking, so it couldn't have been a plane.  It was too fast moving to be a sattelite and to slow to be a shooting star. It moved from one side of the sky to the middle in about 10 seconds and then dimmed off. We thought it was a one time thing and would never see it again, we were surely wrong. About that time we saw another coming from a completely opposite direction.  After about 3 minutes we saw another.....then another, then another, then another.  They all did the exact same thing. We are 16 and 18 so we knew we wouldn't be believed so i called my father outside to see them, he saw 2 and went back inside dumbfounded, he couldn't believe it.  This went on about 14 times in al! l.  Some came very close to planes, but were much smaller than the plane lights.  At one point, there was one about a centimeter behind the other from our eyes.  After a while, we decided to go inside because it was late.;30.5408769230769;-88.1863923076923

Thought it was a trick of light until I saw it again further up the road.  The big one was brighter than the 3 little ones. They were all in a spaced out line.  The big one would glow bright ,them one by one the smaller ones would blink out.  They did this twice before I couldn't see them again.;30.5408769230769;-88.1863923076923
