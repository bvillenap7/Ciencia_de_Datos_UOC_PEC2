I awoke to the sound of a strange noise that sounded like a cross between a slow flying jet and a propeller driven airplane, but it was at a pitch that seemed to resonate and make a very slight vibrating sound.  The second time I heard it, I got out of bed and walked outside.  I looked up and saw a triangular craft with lights on each corner that looked like it was at least 400 - 500 feet up and flying at a very slow speed which looked to me to be around 60 - 70 mph.  The sound it was making was so weird I can't really describe it like I heard it. It was flying in a circle with a circumference of about 3 miles and did this for at least 20 minutes.  It would fly directly over my house.  I even got my video camera out and shot some video, but I don't think it will turn out since it was very dark and my camera couldn't focus on anything.  At one point, there was even a different small 2 or 4 seater airplane that flew under this object at a normal speed and about 300 or so feet below the object.  It then flew in a few oblong circles until it then started to fly in a straight line away from my house at the same speed.

8 stationary objects with red lights hovering in a semi-circle shape for approx 5 mins in Chelsea, AL;2014-12-26 20:45:00;5 minutes;8 stationary objects with red lights hovering in a semi-circle shape for approx 5 mins in Chelsea, AL I walked outside in my back yard around 8:45 pm CST and noticed 8 stationary objects in the NE sky.  They each had 3 red lights and appeared to have a triangle shape.   The objects hovered in a semi-circle formation for approx 3-5 mins and then disappeared.   There wasn't any type of noticable sound like you would hear with a normal airplane.   This was definitely not anything I've ever seen before!;33.2973;-86.661
