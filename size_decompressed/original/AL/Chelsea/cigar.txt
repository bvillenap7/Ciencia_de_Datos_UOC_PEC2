First saw 2 white cigar-shaped objects flying parallel to each other, but not touching.  I thought they looked like missiles, but they were travelling pretty slowly.  They disappeared into the sunlight and I didn't see them after that.   About 20 minutes later, I saw a third white cigar-shaped object of similar size in the sky.  It was moving until it, too, disappeared after just a couple of minutes.  I was certain it was different from a plane or helicopter.;33.2973;-86.661
