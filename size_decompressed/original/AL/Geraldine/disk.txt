Strange blue lights rotating in a circular formation behind my house over my pasture.;2014-06-27 23:00:00;30-40 minutes;Strange blue lights rotating in a circular formation behind my house over my pasture. It was late at night and I pulled into my yard. It was lightning but not a stormy lightning more of a heat lightning.  When I shut my car off it was pitch black.  I looked up and plain as day all I could see were 2 baby blue lights moving in a circular formation.  The lights were opposite from each other.  The object did not move it appeared to be stationary.  As time went on the lights began to fade.  The fading duration lasted abot 10 minutes.   A little after this my sister and I began to see light pillars but the pillars did not reach the ground. We have cows in our pasture and we heard a sound that we've never heard before, it was like a huffing grunting sound nothing like a cow.  Then everything was gone like it had never been there.;34.3545;-86.023
