While in orchestra rehearsal, my friend and I noticed an abnormally slow moving fireball moving  leisurely through the sky while looking out the window.  It was orange and slow moving, with no smoke and a very short trail.  It was much larger than any aircraft I have ever seen. It moved slowly from one corner of the window to another.  I thought nothing of it, that it was possibly a meteor, until reading reports recently that describe exactly what I have seen.;33.2053322580645;-87.5313274193547

At 8:20 pm CST on 9/9/2013 I saw a large object streak from a 12:00 position to the horizon in a NW to SE direction.  I was much larger than a “Shooting Star”, it was white /green as it streaked across the segment of the horizon that I was able to observe.;33.2053322580645;-87.5313274193547

It was glowing orange.  I watched for a few minutes then the light seemed to be going farther away and turning into a small point of white light, it looked like a regular star.   After a few minutes the light would seem to come closer again and glow bright orange.  This happened several times.  There was no sound coming from this object.  The movement from this object was smooth, not jerky.  It did move across the tree line slowly, but the moving in and out, far away, and then close was strange.;33.2053322580645;-87.5313274193547
