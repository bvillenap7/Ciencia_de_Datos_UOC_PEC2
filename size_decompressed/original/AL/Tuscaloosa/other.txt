We've been in our home since Feb. 2003 and live in a small rural neighborhood on the outskirts of town.  On the Night in question we had just returned to our yard after a leisurely walk around the block with our dog Trina.  The sky was basically clear with only a few small clouds scattered here and there.  We decided to play fetch with Trina in the field behind our house,(5 acres of flat treeless land).  I'm a stargazer and am constantly looking for shooting stars when the heavens permit.  Looking into the northeastern sky, I saw 3 points of light, in triangle form, moving at a steady pace high in the atmosphere traveling southeast. (I am not  too sure on the direction of travel) I pointed the lights out to my husband, he suggested it was a plane.  It may well have been but the lights were not blinking and there was no sound. Like I stated earlier, we live in a rural  area and it is very quiet and dark, with the exception of the occasional car passing.  We both watched the light formation for around 10 minutes. Without warning the lights vanished.  I would like to say that it went behind a unseen cloud but the exact area it vanished at was spotted with stars and there were no clouds anywhere near.  We continued to watch, thinking that if it indeed went behind a unseen cloud that surely it would reappear.  15 minutes later there was still no sign of the object.  The object moved steadily and made no stops or turns.  We were sober, as we both niether drink alcohol or use drugs. Although I have been a believer for many years my husband became one on that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));33.2053322580645;-87.5313274193547
Egg shaped flashing silent craft flew in front of the moon and 5 more over my house.;2008-03-14 04:00:00;25 mins;Egg shaped flashing silent craft flew in front of the moon and 5 more over my house. I was at a friend's house this past march and was leaving to my house which was a few blocks away.  I walked outside and noticed a red, green, blue and white strobe like flash a few hundred feet off the ground to my left as soon as i walked into his driveway.  I stood still afraid I was going to miss something as it flew in front of the moon where i saw what looked like an egg or almond shape with a solid thin line of exhaust that disappeared a couple hundred feet behind it.  The top half of the craft appeared to be a light grid that flashed a spectrum of colors like I had never seen before.  After it passed I ran and grabbed my friend, he saw it but it was too far away to tell what it was.  I went home and saw 2 dim yellowish lights in the distance at about 4:15 A.M.  I ran inside and grabbed my mother out of bed and over the course of about 15 mins 5 crafts flew over us.  First 2, then 2 more, then 1 about 5 minutes apart from each other.  The last one that passed over our driveway made a sound like I had never heard before, like a call or a signal.  I believe it acknowledged that we were seeing it.  It did the same call twice which sounded like a hawk's call mixed with a whistling bottle rocket, but it sounded digital.  Like eeeyyyeeerrr  eeeee. My mother and I still don't know what we saw but it would prove to be the first in a series of sightings that still continues.  I contacted the local FBI office but I felt like I wasn't being taken seriously. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));33.2053322580645;-87.5313274193547
Trapezoid shaped hovering craft with dark red flashing lights moved side to side directly above me.;2008-04-01 03:30:00;2-3 mins;Trapezoid shaped hovering craft with dark red flashing lights moved side to side directly above me. This was my second sighting.  I was smoking a cigarette listening to my Ipod in my driveway early one morning when i started to wave my hand over the light to create a slow strobe pattern.  After a couple of minutes i took my headphones off and looked at the sky.  I didn't hear or see anything come near me, but I looked up and saw a trapezoid shaped craft hovering silently about 75-100 feet above me.  The outline of the craft was a flashing red line that was the shape of a trapezoid, two equal sides then the front of the craft was shorter than the bottom.  It moved from side to side in a kind of sporadic movement, I was frozen stiff scared and stood there for about 20 seconds staring at it then cautiously waved at it, it then changed to a red and white light pattern and hovered away towards the moon behind my house.

Observed a flying dart.;2014-06-03 18:25:00;20 seconds;Observed a flying dart. I witnessed a very high altitude vehicle, best description a dart.  I was viewing the Moon when the craft passed between my vantage point, Moon was in the southwestern sky, the object was at approximately 70,000 feet moving southeast to northwest.   It had a clearly definable contrail behind it approximately 1000 feet in length.  The color was reflecting the setting sun and glistened.   It took the object less than 5 seconds to clear my vantage point.   This was not a commercial airliner and there are not many military vehicles that can fly at that altitude.   No sound. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded, and sincere about his report.  PD));33.2053322580645;-87.5313274193547
