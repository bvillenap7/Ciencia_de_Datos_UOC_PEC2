At least 7 high speed lights seen over Tuscaloosa/Hillcrest, AL;2009-08-31 05:00:00;30 mins;At least 7 high speed lights seen over Tuscaloosa/Hillcrest, AL I went outside to have a cigarette on my balcony (which faces east south east) and saw strange lights moving in a pattern which no airplane could.  I counted at least 7 but there could've been as many as 12.  The lights would come and go like fire-flys.  It looked like bee's swarming around a nest.  They were all moving at incredibly high speed doing loops and rolls, but not like an airplane could.  All the turns were incredibly tight.  It's been about thirty minutes and its still going on.  I wish I had a camera.;33.2053322580645;-87.5313274193547
