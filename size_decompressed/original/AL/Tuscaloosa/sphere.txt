Black orb spotted over Interstate 20/59.;2014-01-04 23:56:00;Few seconds;Black orb spotted over Interstate 20/59. Heading down interstate 20/59, I looked up and spotted what appeared to be a large black orb drifting overhead.  It had a single red light on the bottom of it, seeming to take up 1/3rd of its shape.  It moved at a steady pace but was not incredibly fast.  It drifted across the road and disappeared beyond the trees.;33.2053322580645;-87.5313274193547
