Saucer skirts clouds, disappears;1996-09-01 17:00:00;<1 min.;Saucer skirts clouds, disappears A friend of mine had come over to visit and we were in my backyard with the dog. As if compelled to, I looked up and my eyes focused on something moving. It was a partly cloudy day, but clear, not hazy or humid - blue skies dotted with white cumulus - we were looking SSE and it was traveling from east to west. I judged the altitude to be a couple thousand feet in the air and it was moving along the edge of a cloud, skirting it. It looked almost like a frisbee and it was silver. Maybe 3 seconds after focusing on it the craft seemed to turn 90 degrees onto its side where it took on a saucer or circular appearance. It then disappeared among the clouds it had been skirting. My friend and I looked at each other dumbfounded and quickly went inside. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));33.2053322580645;-87.5313274193547
