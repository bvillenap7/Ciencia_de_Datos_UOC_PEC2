Light seen circling above Tuscaloosa's University of Alabama Quad;2017-02-27 01:30:00;~30 minutes;Light seen circling above Tuscaloosa's University of Alabama Quad I was sitting in the grass in middle of the quad at the University of Alabama at about 1:30AM, enjoying the peacefulness. A young man approached me and asked if I saw the object quickly circling above us in the sky. After a a minute, I spotted a slightly translucent shape against the dark sky.  I could not determine the color, though the other witness said it was green.  It moved in a circular pattern at high speed.  As far as we could tell, its height above the ground was slightly higher or equal to the height of Denny Chimes Tower, 115 feet. After a few minutes, as I trained my eyes to follow the shape as it moved, I thought that it was bobbing up and down a little as it moved, much in the same way as a bird flaps its wings. The other witness talked about recent social media reports at the Quad about sightings of Mothman, but I have not seen these reports.  I speculated whether it was search lights to warn aircraft of their low altitudes, or water from the sprinklers refracting off the street lights in the clouds. After several sprinklers turned off, the object was still there circling. The other witness approached 2 girls to ask if they saw it, and they did. We also asked a man passing by if he saw the object, bringing witness count to 5.  He watched the rotations of the light as it circled, to figure out its speed and concluded it must a strobe light of some kind. When this 5th witness left, we lost sight of the circling object.;33.2053322580645;-87.5313274193547

I got out of the car to move the phone around and a glowing light caught my attention in the sky. When i first seen it it sent an overwhelming feeling through my body and it made me cry.  I couldn't stop looking at it.  Then it started to glow brighter than any star it the sky . Then it disappeared for 5 seconds and reappeared growing brighter each time.  It started to scare me so i called my neighbor over just to make sure i wasn't crazy.  And he said he never seen nothing like it.;33.2053322580645;-87.5313274193547
