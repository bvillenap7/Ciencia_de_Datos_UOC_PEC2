Three to four different oblects together being attacked by jets.;2003-11-16 23:32:00;about 4 min.;Three to four different oblects together being attacked by jets. It was about 11:23 Pm and i was heading home from work and i looked up in the sky through the front windsheild of my car and i saw about 3 to 4 red,blue,green,and white objects they looked like they were together in a straight line. Then some jets came tward it and it looked like they blew it up i live near an army base and we have jets and other flying vehicles flying over all the time so i would have been able to know weather it was a jet of some sort or not. It looked like nothing i had ever seen before. they were at a high spot in the sky they stayed in that spot for about 4 minutes and then faded.;31.3432000000001;-85.8439999999998
Silent Moving Bright Light makes impossible 90 degree turn to the west;2005-11-08 05:11:00;10 seconds;Silent Moving Bright Light makes impossible 90 degree turn to the west At 05:11 CST this morning retired Army Officer, veteran, and career military aviator was standing in the back yard of his home in Southeast Alabama (performing usual sky-watch activities), when he witnessed an anomalous object perform an impossible maneuver against the bright star field over his head.  Appearing (blinking on) where he happened to be looking at about 40 degrees elevation into the western sky, a Mars bright object (Mars was also seen) silently appeared at about 290 deg and traveled at a rate of approximately three degrees a second north to south for 10 degrees, where it made a hard (snap!) protoplasm-smearing 90 degree to due west... traveling another degree or so before blinking out.  Sighting was complete in under 10 seconds.  Witness is not misleading, misled or mentally ill.  Witness saw more than mere birds, boosters, bolides, or balloons.  He was not seeing fairies, suffering vapors... or having an episode.;31.3432000000001;-85.8439999999998
