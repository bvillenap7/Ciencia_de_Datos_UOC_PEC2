My 9 year old son and I had just stepped outside onto our back porch to skywatcher. It was around 11am. I was watching the sky when I had seen a dark grey sphere. There was no light emanating from it. It was probably a half a mile away from us. I asked my son if it was a bird. He has really good vision. He said no that it wasnâ€™t a bird at all. We watched it come towards us and then after 5 seconds it changed direction and headed East. Maintaining its sphere shape. There was no noise and we only saw one.;31.3432000000001;-85.8439999999998
