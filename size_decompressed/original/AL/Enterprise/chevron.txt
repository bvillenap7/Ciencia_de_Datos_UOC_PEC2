Was standing on the flightline watching the sky for shooting stars. Clear and cool, the stars were out in force. Directly overhead I spotted what looked like 2 chevron shaped objects glowing faintly re/orange.They moved from northwest to southeast at astonishing speed. They were visable for approximatly 3 seconds before they disappeared. They moved at the speed of a shooting star and appeared to be at very high altitude. The objects were in a echelon right formation. First time I ever seen something in the sky I could not identify.;31.3432000000001;-85.8439999999998
