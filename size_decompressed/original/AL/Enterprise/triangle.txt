Large black triangular ship seen near Enterprise, Alabama.;1998-10-15 21:00:00;15 minutes;Large black triangular ship seen near Enterprise, Alabama. I was traveling in my semi, east on highway 82 about 10 miles outside Enterprise, Alabama. It was dark that night, but we had a clear sky. I could tell i had very large fields on both sides and up ahead i could see a tree line about a mile ahead. All of a sudden i saw bright lights moving through the trees and thought it was a car, but when the lights went upward i knew it wasn't. As the lights came above the trees, i saw a faint out line and for a moment thought it was a huge airplane, but when i got close i saw it was a huge triangular ship hovering slowly above the trees about 100 feet. The ship was black and as big as a football stadium. My Heart leaped in my throat when i saw it and i edged over to the side of the highway to watch it. There were no other vehicles around so i turned off my truck to see if i could hear anything and it was deathly quiet. Absolutely no noise. Then one of it's bright lights, which were in each corner of the ship, rotated downward and was spotlighting the field as it passed over the trees and then above the field. It traveled very slow in a southward direction and finally slowly disappeared over the horizon. I started my truck back up and proceeded to head on towards Enterprise. On my way i met a few other truckers and asked them over the CB if they had seen any strange lights, but to my surprise not one person had seen anything.
