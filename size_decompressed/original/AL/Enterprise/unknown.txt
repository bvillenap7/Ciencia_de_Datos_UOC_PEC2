Object observed traveling west with a small cloud behind it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report is from aviation mechanic.  PD));2015-04-19 19:30:00;10 minutes;Object observed traveling west with a small cloud behind it. I was traveling from Dothan to Enterprise on hwy 84 when I saw an object at an high altitude.  It had what looked like a contrail, but the trail was very short and moved with the object.  The front of the object would glow bright the diminish, but it could still be seen heading west.  The sun was setting, but there was still plenty of visibility.   A second light appeared below the object to the south of it.  The second object flew north parallel to the horizon.  When it had went north it completely disappeared, and wasn't seen again.  The first object continued west for a span of 10-15 minutes.  It went behind a large cloud. When we got to the point that we could see through what was left of the cloud the object was no longer visible.   My background is a mechanic in aviation, and this was very disturbing.
