Rotating beam of light;2013-07-27 22:00:00;Split Second;Rotating beam of light We were on a boat on Inland Lake stargazing.  I was looking in a Southerly direction at an angle of about 45-50 degrees into the sky when I saw a flash of light.  It was not a meteor or an aircraft.  It was stationary and looked a lot like the light one might see if viewing a lighthouse from a great distance away (ie, like a rotating beacon).  It flashed/rotated only once.  About 30 seconds later I saw it again at about the 7 o'clock position from where it was the first time, just marginally down and to the left of its original position. Like I said, it was definitely not an aircraft and definitely not a meteor.  It did not move across the sky, but rather it just looked like a single rotation of a beacon or very bright light and then disappeared.  Altitude is indeterminable.;33.8201;-86.6072
