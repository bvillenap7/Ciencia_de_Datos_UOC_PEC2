Second time seeing craft to the west of us.;2018-06-25 20:15:00;30 minutes;Second time seeing craft to the west of us Not sure about this.  Anyway, last year in August, me, ((woman #1 name deleted)), ((male name deleted)) and ((woman #2 deleted)) were at Dauphin Island.  Around dusk we see this barbell looking thing over the west end of the island.  We watch it for a while, then it disappears and reapers 90 degrees away in the sky over Pascagoula, MS.  It eventually goes down like it is landing.  ((male name deleted)) told me Pascagoula has been a hot spot for UFO activity for years.  I look it up and he is right, never heard of this before.   Anyway, fast forward 10 months, and I see it again last night, same exact place in the sky.  It was dumbell shaped too, then turned so you only saw one end.   I got video both times.  Here is the one from last night, anyone know what the hell this is?;30.257;-88.105
