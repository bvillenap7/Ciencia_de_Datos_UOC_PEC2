Several shadows flying along the shore in Dauphin Island, AL.;2019-04-21 21:15:00;2-3 seconds;Several shadows flying along the shore in Dauphin Island Al. Walked out onto the deck of a vacation rental to look at what I thought might be a lighthouse.  When out of the corner of my eye I saw between 6 maybe 7 shadows flying at a high rate of speed just off the shoreline maybe 50 ft above the water level.   My 19-year-old son was looking out the window with his hands cupped against the glass to see if he could see the lighthouse saw the same thing.   There was no sound nor any explanation that nether of us could come up with.;30.257;-88.105
