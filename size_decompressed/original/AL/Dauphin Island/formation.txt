8 very bright lights in formation of 4 and 4.  Lights moved overhead with no noise and then disappeared with glow overhead.;2014-05-08 21:00:00;~1 minute;8 very bright lights in formation of 4 and 4.  Lights moved overhead with no noise and then disappeared with glow overhead. My husband and I live on the west end of Dauphin Island.   We went outside at approximately 9:00 p.m. to take the trash to the curb on Pushmataha, Ct.  Simultaneously, our eyes were drawn to a series of lights over the Gulf water just off shore.  The lights were in a line formation of four and four across.  There were as bright as the headlamps on a truck.  In seconds, the lights went out and a glow appeared overhead and then the lights were gone.  We listened but did not hear anything resembling an aircraft or ultralight.  We stayed outside for approximately 10 minutes but did not see anything else.  This was a very bizarre event.   We have lived on Dauphin Island for approximately 8 months and have never seen anything like this.;30.257;-88.105
