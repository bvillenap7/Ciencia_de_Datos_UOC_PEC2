(??);late at night / horseshoe shaped craft / 17 lights off and on / 20 mins then vanishes / sees crafts often / One night about 1 yr ago I was with my aunt and uncle driving home when about 17 lights in horseshoe formation lifted from the ground behind a long stretch of woods.  The lights stayed in the sky for about 20 mins staying to the east and close to the ground often dipping behind the trees, or it seemed from where we were. We noticed that the lights would go off for about one minute then come back on.  The craft stayed at a stedy pace just in front of us to the east about 150yds away. The craft then, after 20 minutes, shut its lights off and raised high in the air and seemed to vanish. We never saw it again.  P.S. I see U.F.O.'s here about once every two or three months.
