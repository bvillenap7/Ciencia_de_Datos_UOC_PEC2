I SAW THE OBJECT THROUGH MY GLASS STORM DOOR. I TURNED THE POARCH LIGHT OFF TRYING TO GET A BETTER LOOK AT IT.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A STREET LIGHT.  BUT IT WAS MUCH TOO HIGH IN THE SKY TO BE A STREET LIGHT.  IT WAS VERY BRIGHT& BIG SO I DID NOT THINK THAT IT COULD BE A STAR.  FINALLY, I ASSUMED THAT IT WAS A STAR SO I CALLED MY MOTHER TO TELL HER ABOUT IT.  AT THAT TIME MY NEIGHBOR CAME OUTSIDE TO LEAVE.  I RAN OUTSIDE TO TELL HIM TO LOOK  AT THAT TIME THE STAR STARTED MOVING STRAIGHT UP INTO THE AIR ALSO THE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT WENT OFF & A RED & A GREEN LIGHT CAME ON.  AFTER IT MOVED UP IT STARTED MOVING WEST AT THE SAME TIME LIKE IN A SLANT  ALSO IT LEFT A VERY DIM TAIL BEHIND BUT VERY BRIEFLY ALMOST LIKE FIREWORKS DOTHEN IT STOPPED MOVING UP & ONLY MOVED WEST.  MY NEIGHBOR & I WERE SAYING WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?' TO EACH OTHER WHILE IT WAS STILL MOVING UP & WEST I RAN INSIDE TO GET MY CAMERA.  WHEN I CAME BACK OUT MY NEIGHBOR SAID GO GET YOUR CAMERA.  I SAID IVE GOT IT IVE GOT IT SO I TOOK SOME PICTURES THEN HE SAID TAKE ANOTHER PICTURE MY CAMERA ONLY TAKES PICTURES UP TO 15 FT THIS THING WAS HUNDREDS OF FEET AWAY SO I KNOW IT WILL NOT SHOW UP IN A PICTURE.  THIS OBJECT NEVER PUT OFF ANY SOUND  ANY TIME THAT I HAVE SEEN AN AIRPLANE OR HELICOPTER THAT LOW TO THE GROUND I HAVE HEARD A SOUND;31.0594;-87.4855
