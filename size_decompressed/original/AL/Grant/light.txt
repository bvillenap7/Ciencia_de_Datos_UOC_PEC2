Solid pair of lights moving very fast with up and down motion across the night sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-04-14 22:00:00;2 minutes;Solid pair of lights moving very fast with up and down motion across the night sky. Saw 2 lights side by side.  Sure it was one craft.  Was about the same size as the stars but brighter.  Moved from my far right to my far left while slowly moving up and down.  No noise.   Not a plane or anything I've seen before.  I have lived near The Space and Rocket center for 25yrs.   Very fast.  Faster than any jet or airplane.  From my view the round lights were about a 1/4 in. apart, horizontal never vertical.   I noticed my computer humming/static and the electricity in the house went on and off 3xs before I went outside to look up.
