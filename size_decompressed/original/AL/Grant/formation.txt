There were what appeared to be two large crafts though bright orange lights were all I could see.One craft had 5 bright orange lights.The lights were in the shape of a bell like a connect the dots picture.I saw a large cloud standing alone and it was kind of bright lit by the moon it was bright.The lights moved toward the cloud(not very fast) and as it approached the cloud another craft suddenly came into view.This craft appeared to be rectangular in shape,again all I had to go by were the lights.I did not count them but I think there were twelve(12),they were in two rows six in each row one row over the other again like a connect the dots rectangle.The lights were also bright orange. The first object began to disappear into the cloud and as it did the second object accelerated toward the cloud and they both disappeared into it.The cloud was the only one in that part of the sky and I could see the whole thing it was not huge but I never saw either craft exit the cloud.Also the cloud was not really high in the sky,one of those low hanging clouds,it was a very clear night .I have not seen anything like that before or since.I know they were UFO's.;34.498;-86.257
