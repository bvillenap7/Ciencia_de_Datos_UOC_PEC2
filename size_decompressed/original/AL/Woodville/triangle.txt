They swept around to the front and it took off north. Me (26) and a friend (32) were driving home from college one night.  We were going through the town of Woodville on Hwy 72, travelling east.  Coming over a small mountain, I saw a couple of white lights and a red blinking light.  I thought, there is a plane.  See them all the time and it looked just like that. I then noticed, Hey, isn't that plane awfully low?  Oh my gosh, it is going to crash, it looked like it was getting lower.  My friend said, What is that?   Just so happened he had glass tops in his corvette and I was on the passenger side.  As it came over the top of us, I watched it.  It wasn't moving as fast as we were so it had to be less that 60 miles an hour.  It sort of stopped, suspended in air over the highway for a couple seconds.  I could see the dark shape but couldn't tell if it was quite triangular or not.  The most amazing thing was the lights.  I saw a red blinking one underneath.  There were 4 white lights, 2 on the front and 2 on the rear.  Now, what was odd about these lights was the fact that they were all shining backwards.  You could see the beams off into the night sky.  Kind of like shining a flashlight and kicking up a bunch of dust - you see the beam.  Well, when it stopped, all 4 beams slowly turned clockwise, sweeping down across the road and then turned up to shine forward.  When they did this, it started moving again and quickly flew north.  It was moving from the south.  The mountains there are about 1000-1200 feet high, so it could have only been 1300-1500 in the air.  I have never been able to explain what I saw that night and I try to explain away most everything.;34.6689;-86.2296
