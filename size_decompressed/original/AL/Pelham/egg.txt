Object seen during morning commute near Pelham, Alabama.;2018-03-22 07:18:00;5-10 seconds;Object seen during morning commute near Pelham, Alabama. I was driving to work on the morning of March 22, 2018 on highway 65 from Birmingham, Alabama, to the nearby city of Pelham.  It was a sunny morning, with few or no clouds, and traffic was heavy as usual but going at a good speed.  I was about 5 miles from my exit, when I looked up in the sky and saw a tiny dot-sized object that was moving very slowly or maybe not at all.  I would guess that it was about a mile or two away and probably not very large.  It seemed to have a silvery or reflective surface.  I could not tell what it was, exactly, because of its distance, and assumed it was a plane or helicopter.   I looked back down at the road for no more than 1 or 2 seconds and then looked up again and it was gone.  A plane or helicopter would not have been able fly out of sight that quickly, especially given the fact that it was barely moving to begin with.  I immediately knew I had witnessed something unusual, and wondered if any of the other commuters had seen what I saw.   I am a 52 year old man and have lived in the Birmingham area for most of my life. This was my second UFO sighting. The first one was several years ago and involved an unexplainable light hovering 5 to 10 feet from ground.;33.2937000000001;-86.7672000000002
