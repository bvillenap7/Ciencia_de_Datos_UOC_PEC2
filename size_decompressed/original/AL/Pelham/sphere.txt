On my way to work, white sphere moving faster than anything i've ever seen before.  Over Oak Mountain State Park.  too close to be a comet/shooting star.  too fast to be military.  too bright for me to be the only one who noticed.  no sound.  no trail/tail.  it was gone just as fast as i noticed it.;33.2937000000001;-86.7672000000002
