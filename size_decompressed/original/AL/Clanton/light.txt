Two very bright solid orange lights fly overhead with no sound.;2004-11-27 19:35:00;5 mins;Two very bright solid orange lights fly overhead with no sound. As I arrived home I noticed two very bright orange solid lights moving steadily across the sky from west to east.  Both lights were identical and brighter than plane lights and not blinking as a plane's would.  I've never observed anything quite like this and called my Mom out to witness the event.  The sky was partly cloudy with a bright moon as we viewed the two lights appear to move about the speed of a low altitude plane, but there was no sound whatsoever.  As the two lights went behind some trees the first one disappeared, but we viewed the second light continue in its path and appear to move in front of the clouds.  We watched the one remaining light continue off into the east and into heavier clouds while glowing very brightly.  Occasionally the solid orange light would flicker slightly but continue to glow brighter than anything I'm use to seeing in the sky.  I deliver newspapers at night and am use to viewing planes at night as well as meteor showers and even satellites and I'm positive these were not astronomical in nature, and not any kind of aircraft I've ever witnessed before.;32.83551875;-86.6400343750001
