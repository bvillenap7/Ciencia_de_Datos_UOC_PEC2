Triangle Shaped craft between Opp and Andalusia;2003-10-17 20:45:00;15 mins;Triangle Shaped craft between Opp and Andalusia Me and my girlfriend were driving home from the Movie Theatre in Andalusia and we saw this triangle shaped craft with a blue light on the left and a red light on the right both lights were flashing. There were a few lights underneath the craft. It hovered for a few minutes above the trees and follwed the car until about the Opp city Limits, where it moved off and then disappeared. Most people I have told this too say it is a helicopter or airplane. There was no sound, and there aren't any airplanes around this area that can hover for a few minutes. If it were a helicopter you could have heard the sound of the blades but there was nothing but silence.;31.2778;-86.254
