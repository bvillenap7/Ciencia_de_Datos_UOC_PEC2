Brief star like light to the left of sun;2012-12-23 15:00:00;5 seconds;brief star like light to the left of sun driving and saw star like object to the left of sun, exact time was not noted. Observed to the immediate left of the sun and appeared brighter but much smaller.  (comparable to the planets that were so bright in the early morning skies over the past several months.)  This was a day sighting however, and only saw for several seconds then it was gone.   Looked all around for it but did not see it again.  Did notice a thin clooud-like trail a good distance to the left that curved up and through an actual small cloud, and right above that cloud it ended. not sure if it was part of the cloud but it did not appear to be a typical cloud attribute, closest example is like a nike swoosh?  It did seem practical by its placement that it could have been created by what we saw. other wittness was wife.;31.2778;-86.254
