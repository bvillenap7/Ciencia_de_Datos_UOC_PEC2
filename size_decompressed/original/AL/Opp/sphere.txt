Strange stationary lights in the sky.;2003-10-17 00:30:00;several hours;Strange stationary lights in the sky. I noticed several objects in the sky about the size of stars. However, they were blinking from red to blue to white rather quickly. I assumed they were normal aircraft at first, but they didn't move. I checked hours later and they were in the same spot. One appeared larger and I assume it was closer. Upon magnified viewing of the closest one, I could make out 3 lights side by side.;31.2778;-86.254
