We seen a second craft behaving in the same manner.  They seem to dimming out when airplanes are in the area.  We were looking towards the NW and then they turned and went back towards the north.  They are still in the area flashing their lights.  (as if they are signaling each other) they are moving unlike any other aircraft I have seen.  They were in the area a few nights ago, doing the same thing, except they were staying lit up, and moving at a very fast speed, then suddenly, coming to a stop before hovering and moving off in a different direction.  I witness this for a couple of hours before moving off.  One object is blue and the other object changes from red to blue.  No sound associated with the objects.  They fluctuate in brightness.  No trails are being left.;33.3506;-87.9018
