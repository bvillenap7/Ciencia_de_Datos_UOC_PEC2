Two bright round objects in Gordo, AL.;2012-12-02 18:00:00;30 seconds;Two bright round objects in Gordo, AL I was standing on my back deck, I was looking into the sky when I saw a bright white fire ball shoot across the sky and go down below the tree line.  The object was round and  was sparkly, it left a light trail behind it. It disappeared below the tree line.  It lasted about 15-20 seconds.   Shortly after that maybe 2-3 mins later my husband and I saw a bright round object bigger and brighter than a star appeared from the south at a high elevation and desended to the north and slowly faded and disappeared.;33.3506;-87.9018
