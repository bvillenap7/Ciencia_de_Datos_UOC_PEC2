new glass like craft seen;1997-04-23 18:00:00;2MIN;new glass like craft seen   I was working as an assistant manager of a dollar store in guntersville alabama as I was coming home from work one afternoon about 6pm I was gazing across a cow pasture to my left as I was stopped in traffic just outside of town when I noticed a distortion of the surrounding trees and such! a craft about the size of a small house was hovering about 25ft above the ground it looked a lot like the thing in the trees on the movie preditor as it was projecting what was behind the craft which made it look as though nothing was there there was no sound, and no thrusters or anything of that naturewas noted. I also saw no doors or openings and no beings. just the craft. it started moving slowly across the field slightly left and away from me the cows continued grazing as nothing was there then it swiftly moved out and streight up at a tremendious amount of speed and was out of sight in a couple seconds it was a clear day and no buildings or anything could have generated the thing I saw I had been at work and had not taken any medicines of anykind and had not drink amy alcohol as far as I knew I was the only person who saw it I wrote it down when I got home and tried to report this to the army airforce and many others with out any one writing me back.these new craft are glass like and if you didnâ€™t see the distortions you would not be able to see them ifter a lot of thought its my conclusion that this is more than likely why reports have been so low they have gotten smart and have new tecnology I later went to school and became an L.P.N. and  now I am disabled due to a bad back but this was a real craft and if you will look at the alien in the movie preditor you can get an idea about how the craft was doing i also saw no lights or landing gearthe craft was like a mirror;34.3453999999997;-86.2739999999994
