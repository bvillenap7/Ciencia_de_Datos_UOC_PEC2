((HOAX??))  I saw a large bright white light toward the ENE from my front yard.;2001-09-05 20:45:00;15min;I saw a large bright white light toward the ENE from my front yard.  It was across the river and above the mountains.   I called my mother, who lives nearby, and told her to come outside to see it.  I was on the phone talking with her as she was coming outside to see it.  Before she got outside, however, the large bright light shot straight up into the sky and disappeared quickly.   As I was telling her what I had seen, military aircraft began flying overhead.  We counted eight airplanes in a row, flying low in a straight line, directly toward (ENE) where I had seen the bright light in the sky.
