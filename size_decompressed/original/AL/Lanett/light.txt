It came, it saw , it left but where did it go or come from?;1985-05-01 20:30:00;10 seconds;It came, it saw , it left but where did it go or come from? I should not be mentioning this stuff due to the fact that it has been a long time ago but I know what I saw.  I just want to get it off my chest and find out if such a phenomenom is possible.  I was sitting on a bench with a friend of mind in his mother's backyard.  It was night time and we were talking about jobs.  I looked up into the night sky which was clear but had a few clouds.  Within a matter of seconds, a solid ball of light come out of no where, from right to left, as if from an invisible door.  It stopped and just hovered for about 5 seconds then it returned back from left to right into that invisible door persay.  I think about it every other chance I get.  Especially when I see perculiar documentaries on tv.  I do not need to have correct gramma because I know what I saw and I do believe whenever I see facts that such a thing is possible, I will feel at ease.  Thank you for listening. Now, you can shred it as though it is a mere prank.  I ! know it happened and that is all that matters to me.
