My wife and I were fishing in our back lake around 6:30 p.m. e.s.t., when we noticed a very bright shining object in the sky.  No movement noticed for about thirty minutes.   Back at our house we could still see the object.  Went inside for a minute, came back out and it was gone.  I did get a picture.;32.8616000000001;-85.2160999999998
