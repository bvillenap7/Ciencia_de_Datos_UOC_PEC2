We saw east in the sky what we thought were two airplanes flying one behind another.  They were flying from the northeast to the southwest in a line.  We were still looking in the sky and saw two more flying very close one behind the other.  I continued looking in the sky and there were two more flying very close, again, one behind the other. They made no noise, they left no emissions or smoke trails.  They flew in a line about the same height, all going the same speed.  The last one I saw by myself because my grandmother and my cousin went in the house.  I saw another flying object this one seeming a little further away than the rest and it looked like it was falling at an angle from the sky I don’t know where it went because I couldn’t see it when it went below the tree line.  All the objects seemed to have the same shape.  They all had lights that were orangish red.  I can’t see that well, but my grandmother said they looked to be in the shape of a triangle with a line below the triangle with lights all over them. Altogether there were 7 flying objects, moving in a trail one behind the other, with the last one being further behind the rest and a little further out descending rapidly from the sky.;32.9108;-87.5935
