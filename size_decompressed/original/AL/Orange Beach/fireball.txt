Flaming Fireball The Size of a Building Over Island;2019-01-15 01:20:00;7 seconds;Flaming Fireball The Size of a Building Over Island Standing outside center of island facing West, HUGE fireball the size of a house comes flying over my right shoulder from the East, parallel to the gulf. I was on the phone and I screamed. It was definitely in our atmosphere, at an altitude of around 15,000 feet. I was prepared to hear a catastrophic boom, but I never heard a point of contact. It was flaming and hundreds of thousands of times larger than any shooting star I see here regularly.;30.281;-87.5815
