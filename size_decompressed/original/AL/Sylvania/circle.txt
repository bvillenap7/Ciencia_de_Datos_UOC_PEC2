I was writing my book all day and into the night, when I stepped away from the keyboard and decided to have a smoke outside in the backyard.  I stretched my back and looked up into the sky.  Directly at the zenith overhead, I saw two white pearl-like circular craft flying in formation next to each other.  They were not star-like in luminosity, but had an interior blue-white gleam that made them almost transparent.   The two craft were a raised thumb apart in distance from each other and moving very, very fast from north to south.  The duration of the sighting lasted for approximately seven to eight seconds before they disappeared over/in the horizon.  At arm's length they were pea-sized.  I was quite shocked to see this.   I had seen many sats with my large telescope, but nothing ever like this.  I estimate that they were between 30 and 40 thousand feet in altitude.  There was no noise or contrail at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.5576;-85.7876
