I thought they were street lights, but noticed they were actually very low in the sky.  They were bright orange, with no trails. They were in a formation like the upper left quadrant of a circle,  I lost sight of them briefky and the formation had changed to the lower right quadrant of a circle.  They were close to the northeast of the city.   I lost sight of them for 5-10 minutes and there were then only 2, in a flat line to the far southeast of the city.;33.5643;-85.3806
