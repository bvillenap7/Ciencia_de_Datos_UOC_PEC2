2 night sky Camoflaged things!;2011-11-20 22:00:00;10 seconds;2 Night sky Camoflauged things! I was having a family get together around the holidays (unsure of exact date) star gazing. My sister, Daughter, Brother-n-law and I were on my back porch of a one story house.  Just above the roof, hard to tell exact height but, looked as though you almost could touch it once it moved. There were two egg/eyeball shaped “things”!  They appeared almost see through.  They blended in with the stars of the clear night.  They just hovered there with no noise or lights.  Then they literally zipped away.  The entire reason we even saw them was because it moved, really fast!;32.4973;-86.3649000000001
