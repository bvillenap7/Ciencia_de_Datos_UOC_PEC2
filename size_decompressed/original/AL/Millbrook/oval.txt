July 27th 2007 : Millbrook, Alabama   Location: Millbrook, Alabama USA   Date: Friday, 07/27/07  6:00am EST   Approach Direction: West   Departure Direction: East   Witness  Direction: West   Description: Friday, July 27,2007 - while driving west down Cobbs Ford Road toward Prattville, Alabama I saw what appeared to be a UFO streaking across the sky. It was a long oval shape, definetly not an airplane, and was glowing. I was looking out my windshield when I witnessed this. The object was closer than an airplane height and was moving at a fast speed. It was heading in a straight line and just disappeared. There were no clouds in the sky. I think that it was moving so fast that my eyes could not keep up with it. I have never seen something just disappear.  My son was in the vehicle with me and he witnessed the same thing. I have oftened looked into the night sky hoping to see a UFO. I was not prepared at all this morning for what I saw. I keep replaying the incident over and over in my mind to try and remember something else, but this is all that I seem to remember. I am definetly a believer now!
