The object(s) were in a field on the west side. Nursing student on the way home from class. It was 8:00-8:30 on I-65 near Hanceville/Eva exits.  It was dark and out in a field/pasture on west side of Interstate, there was 7-8 Peachy/Pink balls of light in the shape of a HUGE triangle. It was about tree top level or higher (100').  After being seen, I passed by trees and it was then obscured and I couldn't see it anymore.  Very bizarre to see this at night out in a farmers field!  I don't know if it was a triangle craft with the lights on the edges or if there were just 7-8 balls of light in a triangular shape.;34.05;-86.7869999999999
