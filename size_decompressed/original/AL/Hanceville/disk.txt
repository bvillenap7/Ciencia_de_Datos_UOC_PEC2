At about county road 665 heading southwest an object flickered on the horizon directly in front of us.  It was a beautiful sunny day and I think the object had flickered from the sun reflecting off of it. In the blink of an eye it zipped directly over us.  No sound and no sonic boom as this metallic disc zipped straight over us in the opposite direction.  It was 150-200 ft in the air and appeared to be approximately 75 ft wide.  The speed it was traveling was astounding, coming from as far as we could see on the horizon, to zipping past us in a couple of seconds. I stopped the vehicle as I almost took out a mailbox trying to see it in my mirror.  My friend and I just looked at each other and were both in awe of what we had seen.  Neither one of us said anything till a few miles later.  I asked my friend if they knew what that was, because I knew I did.  Their reply, “It was a flying saucer!”;34.05;-86.7869999999999
