I travel SR-31 south every morning on my to work, usually around (5am) so it's always dark. This morning I glanced up to see the stars and I noticed something strange or unusual to me. At first I thought it might have been an airplane or helicopter but it was moving too slow and it lacked the flashing red strobe light. This object was a bright ball of light with a faint red/orange tint to it. Like I said I was traveling south on 31 and the object was moving East to West slowly, just above the mountain there. I watched it for about 10 seconds or so and the sky is wide open there with great visibility, so there was literally nothing that it could disappear behind, and it just vanished right in front of my eyes. Like I said, I'm not sure what it was but I wanted to share my experience and see is anyone else has had similar experiences. I'd like to stay anonymo! us due to my job and political status.;34.05;-86.7869999999999
13 lights, straight trajectory, 30 sec apart, then disappeared.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-11 21:05:00;5;13 lights, straight trajectory, 30 sec apart, then disappeared. My wife and I witnessed 12 silent, single lights with the exact same trajectory, moving SE, appx. 30 seconds apart at a high rate of speed.  Each light disappeared at the exact same location as it was reached. We then saw a thirteenth light appx 1.5 min after the twelvth, stop halfway, then abruptly switch direction and go N.  It disappeared 30 second or so after.;34.05;-86.7869999999999
