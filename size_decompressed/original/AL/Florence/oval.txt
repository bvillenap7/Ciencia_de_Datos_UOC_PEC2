I dont know if this is a dream or not;1992-03-05 06:45:00;Unknown;I dont know if this is a dream or not I have been having a reoccuring dream as of late, all i can remember about it is that it takes place at early morning (the sun has just come up over the trees), that it is winter time(there are no leaves on the trees). I awake and am drawn to look out the window of my bedroom(it faces the south) and I look up in the sky towards the east and just above the rising sun, I see a black oval shaped disk. i turn to run out of my bedroom, I get down the stairs, turn to run to my parents bedroom, and just as I get there im stopped and I cant go any further, I try and call out, but I cant make a sound. after that the dream goes blank. That is all I can remember. Ive been afraid to tell anybody for fear that I will be considered crazy. As far as how old I was at the time, I would have to say 9 or 10.
