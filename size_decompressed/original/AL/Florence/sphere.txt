A red, yet transparent object with two orbiting lights moving very low to the ground without making a sound.;2013-09-28 21:45:00;1 Minute;A red, yet transparent object with two orbiting lights moving very low to the ground without making a sound. My partner and our friend were on the back deck tonight when I noticed something out the corner of my eye.  When we turned to look, we saw a red, transparent object floating horizontally through the sky.  It was spherical in shape and it had two bright red, shield-like objects orbiting around it.  It was hard to gauge its distance from us but it appeared to be within 200 yards from where we were sitting.  The object was very low in the sky and seemed to be just above the tree line.  We watched it move for about a minute until it was out of our line of sight. We felt entranced while watching it move and we were unable to say anything until it had gone.  That may sound strange but prior to sighting the object my phone had frozen up. I'm an avid stargazer and I've ruled out any possibility of it being a plane or helicopter.  The main reason for ruling out common air traffic is that there was no sound.  We can all recall hearing crickets while the sphere passed by.  The local radio station ran a story that many people reported seeing a fireball in the sky tonight, but those reports came in around 6:45pm when we saw the object closer to 10pm. I've never witnessed anything like this before.;34.8552178343949;-87.6888280254777
Silent Bright pulsating light orb that sails slow & low across the sky just above tree tops;2015-01-18 17:50:00;2 minutes;Silent Bright pulsating light orb that sails slow & low across the sky just above tree tops Two nights in a row last night 1-17-15 & tonight 1-18-15 we witnessed at home in our backyard a silent & very bright pulsating light orb sail slow & low across the sky just above our tree tops traveling from the south eastern sky going north.  We see these light orbs occasionally at dusk & sometimes a few hours after dusk.  We have been researching these orbs since 2006 which is when I first made my report here.  At one point we was seeing these orbs so often that it seemed pointless to report every single time.Anyone who reports to Mufon, well good luck!  They will tell you that satellites & the ISS passes over ya at a few hundred to 1000 ft from the ground or that it was a`plane.  I would advise to not report anything to mufon because it's a waste of time.  I am making a report tonight in case anyone in nortwest Alabama has or is seeing these to know that you are not alone.I don't have any photos from the past 2 nights but I do have 1 from Dec 9, 2014, I'll share in email.  I have photographed & filmed these light orbs in the past & they are on youtube.  It's time for answers, more people are seeing these across the states, but no one can make an official announcement?  My advice, do your own research & make those photos & videos & load them up on youtube.  Remember, watch low in the sky from the west & south to north at dusk & when the stars start coming out.;34.8552178343949;-87.6888280254777
