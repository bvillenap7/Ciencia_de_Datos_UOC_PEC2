My mom and I were taking a break from watching a football game when I saw a triangular shape that was identical to the logan's UFO. It simply just flew over and I first noticed and said Mom Look!. She looked up and saw it right before it disapeared. It did not make a noise, but simply flew right across the sky and disapeared.;34.8552178343949;-87.6888280254777
