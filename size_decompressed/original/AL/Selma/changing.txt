Sphere shaped object flashing multiple colors and changing shape.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius.  PD));2012-12-31 19:15:00;2 hours;Sphere shaped object flashing multiple colors and changing shape At the first sight of the object, it seemed to look just like all of the other stars in the night sky.  We noticed that it glared so we assumed it was an airplane.  But, we came to the conclusion it couldn't be an airplane because there was no noise and the speed was just too slow for anything we could think of to stay in the air that high up.  So i grabbed the camcorder (a Full HD Insignia 1920x1080p hand-held)and tried to get a good shot of it. But when i did, we really were clueless as to what this thing was. The object was round in shape.  Viewable only by camera.  It had multiple colors ( green, blue, yellow etc...) emitted from within its shape, that could be seen only during active zoom.  It started to change shape, from top to bottom.  Then, when it came to about half a sphere, a purplish light emitted from the center to about where the top of the original sphere would have been.  As this was taking place, the sphere started to reform.  Once this was complete, it started to continue flashing colors. I will email the video from ((e-address deleted)).  I may have to convert it from avi format to wmv.  If that is okay....but ill wait for a confirmation email before i do so, to protect the authenticity of the video.
