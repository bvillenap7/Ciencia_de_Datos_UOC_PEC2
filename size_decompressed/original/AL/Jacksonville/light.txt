I initially assumed it to be an approaching plane from the Huntsville area.  As the light reached almost due west, it flashed and instatly began a near vertical ascent.  The light visible during ascent (from what I now believed to be the bottom of this object) appeared reddish in color.  The reddish light got increasing smaller as it ascended and finally disappeared;33.831;-85.7752

Two circular red lights resembling star hover above a mountain on new liberty road in pleasant valley area. Both hovered glimmering a red tint just as some stars do.  A jet came by over my house as it is in a flight path.  As the aircraft approached the mountainside the ufo on the right slowly descended behind the mountain until out of sight.   As the aircraft got closer the ufo to the left slowly dropped to the treeline, hovered there a few seconds, and dropped behind the mountain out of sight.   In a five minute window afterwards five planes came flying by in the directon of the ufos.;33.831;-85.7752
