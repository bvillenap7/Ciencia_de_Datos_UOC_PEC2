Circle Appears from cloud cover and moves west.  Photos available;2013-07-12 20:00:00;3 minutes;Circle Appears from cloud cover and moves west.  Photos available I took a series of 5 photos of a gorgeous sunset from my back deck on July 12.  I didn't notice this object while I was taking the shots, but it shows up in several and appears to be moving across the sky.   I have tried to enlarge it to get details but only end up with a circle.  This circle is first seen at the edge of a cloud and in successive photos appears to move west.   I will try and forward the photo set which will have an incorrect date.  The shots were taken within a 3 minute time span.  I hesitated to file this report because I thought it may be a natural object.  When I read a post dated that evening in Atalla, AL, which is about 20 miles away, I decided the photos may be of some significance.;33.831;-85.7752
