Silent Light passes from Southern to Northern Horizon;2007-04-06 20:45:00;45 sec.;Silent Light passes from Southern to Northern Horizon I stepped out onto my western facing deck to smoke and let the dog go before turning in early for the night. It was clear and and unusually cold for April in Alabama so I urged the dog to hurry.  I noticed a steady white approaching quickly from due south at what to me seemed a low altitude. There were no flashing lights like I normally see on planes.  As the light flew directly over my head I was able to see 4 distinct points of white light forming a diamond shape but still saw nothing flashing.  I followed these lights to the northern horizon but never saw any flashing.   When the light was to my north I noticed a plane crossing east to west.  I could clearly see the flashing lights on the plane and could hear its engine even though it was at a higher altitude than the light.  After the light passed out of view on the northern horizon I noted that were 2 other planes in the air at the time (one to my south passing east to west and the other to my west headed south -both headed toward birmingham) Both of these had flashing lights. I could also hear the engine of the plane to my south as it passed. All 3 of the planes were in normal flight patterns  (where I expect to see air traffic)- the light was not.  In fact, I can never remember seeing any plane cross directly over our house like this thing did. The light passed from southern to northern horizon in less than a minute.;33.831;-85.7752
