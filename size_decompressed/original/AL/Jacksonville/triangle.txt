Star formation moving across sky.;2019-03-22 20:05:00;5 minutes;Star formation moving across sky On Mar 22, 2019, I had walked outside my garage to look at the full moon and the stars.  As I looked straight ahead, there was a star formation right in front of me that I had never seen before.   It was sitting perfectly still.  I said to myself, “where did you come from and why are you so close.”   As I stood there watching and thinking the formation looked like it accelerated and started moving about the speed of an airplane.  I said you can’t do that!   I called my granddaughter to come look.  It went behind a tree with no leaves, so it was still visible.  I thought to show it to my granddaughter as it came from behind the tree but it disappeared as if swallowed or it turned off its lights or something. It was comprised of 6 stars and was triangular in shape.  A star formation is a perfect camouflage.;33.831;-85.7752
