When I first looked up and spotted the craft.  I thought it was a large white bird, as I continued watching the craft I noticed that it was a white, rectangular boxed shaped with two large tear like ends.  No cloud trail, no sound, and no reflectivity , and no lights.  It also had a dark black boxed center.  The object was spotted in the northern sky moving from east to west.  The day was a very bright clear day with blue skys, no wind, no clouds.  It moved at a rapid speed, faster than a commercial jet airliner.;33.6055;-85.9633
