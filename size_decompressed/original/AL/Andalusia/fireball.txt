On july 10, 2014, me and my son witnessed a ufo for about a minute and a half.   When I first saw it, I was leaving my truck going to the house.  It was a large flame looking orange in color.  Hold a lighter out as far as you can but perfectly round.  Zero noise though.  Very bright in the night sky and was basically on the horizon.  It covered half the sky in about a minute and seemed as though it was reaching orbit.   I have witnessed many sattallites and this was not one.  My only explanation would be a rocket reaching orbit but there was no sound what so ever.   If anyone else saw or has an explanation I would love to hear it.;31.3025414634147;-86.4913243902439
