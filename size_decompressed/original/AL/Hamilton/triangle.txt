Me and my wife were headed south on hwy 43, approximately 4 miles north of Hamilton, AL.  I saw a white (side view) cigar shaped object flying east over Hamilton for a brief second,  I could not see a tail rudder shape and it was fairly low and level, also as large as it was, I should have been able to see that feature which I didn't.  I immediately was telling wife what i saw and was watching to the east best I could while driving.  Then she started pointing up above tree line, and said she saw a triangular shaped object hovering, and it was white, and now approx 2 miles North of town.   I could not see it bc I was driving, so I got on brakes and started trying to pull over and turn around and she was telling me it was moving North north east now.   I still had not seen it hovering or moving because I was manuvering the truck, however right behind the object was a twin prop military airplane, I assume, because it was a miitary green color, slowly flying same path as the white object.;34.1503;-88.0111
