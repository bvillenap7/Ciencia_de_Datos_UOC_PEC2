My wife and I had been sitting out side, as we started indoors I noticed a fireball looking object!  It was traveling in a northwest direction on a level path aproxomently 3 to 5000 ft off the ground. As the UFO pasted in front of us, it seemed to stop and move in a slight zig zag then continue toward. Then just before the UFO vanished beyond our sight a second UFO appeared traveling on the same path as the first one, making same zig zag only so slightly give us the affect of being dizzy!  They looked be the Size of a small aircraft but only this was no aircraft! Looked like nothing more than a full blaze of fire!  Weirdest thing I have ever seen in my life!;34.1503;-88.0111
