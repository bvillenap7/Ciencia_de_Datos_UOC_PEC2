Affected witnesses. Craft was about the size of a hot tub, downed in thick vegatation.  This was very real and very intense.  The object was illuminating red, green, blue lights primarily. They werent spinning, it was like the lights were fighting one another, but coming out from under the craft.  What was weird-the lights would slow-then speed, fade-then brighten.   Immediately after noticing I directed my two colleagues to the phenemenon and one, the driver, pulled out his knife in panic-got out of the vehicle and stood in the bridge of the door, we directed him back in.   Due to the intense adrenaline and fear-we got the heck out of there.  We were about 50 feet from this object and the next day we had sunburn on parts of our body.. I have remained quiet about this experience for some years now.   I live in a small town and would be shunned for such.  This event was very real and myself and the other two men (whom have families of their own) would be reluctant to come forward als! o..   When something like this really happens to you-you have to consider what could happen if you told.  I want people to know that something is out there.  And unless the military is landing aircraft in city limits of small town america-I doubt it's terrestrial.. P.S) there was ABSOLUTELY no sound.  We were close and all we could hear was crickets.;34.1503;-88.0111
