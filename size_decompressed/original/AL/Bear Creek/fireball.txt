It was intelligent;2001-05-10 00:00:00;10 min;A friend and I were in a boat fishing,when around midnight, we observed what can only be described as a glowing orangedisk. It seemed to hover for a period, no noise at all, and the color and luminosity  never changed. For some reason, it was impossible to tell how large, or how far it was away. after it hovered for a minute or two just above the tree line, it started doing amazing manuevers, speeding incredibly in one direction, only to come to a sudden stop, then reversing. A human couldn't possibly take that kind of g force. We were scared enough that we wouldn't even turn on the flashlight, not wanting to draw attention to ourselves.After as few minutes of these manuevers, it sped off behind the trees, out of our sight.It left no trail in the sky. we waited at least an hour before we turned our lights on,abandoning our fishing trip. I finally decided to file a report, simply because I quit worrying about the opinions of other people. Whatever Rich and I saw, It was intelligent.
