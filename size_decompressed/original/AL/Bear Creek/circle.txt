It was a little bigger than a dime compared the stars. It was circle and bright. It swerved and disappeared. My girlfriend and I were outside talking on my back porch, and i was facing a sliding glassdoor when a very bright light reflected off of it very fast.  It was like a car pulled in to my backyard, and the cars brights reflected off of the glass, but i live out in the woods a car can't get to my backyard. As soon as the light reflected off of the glass i looked at the sky, and saw a very bright circle moving very fast.  It was a little bigger than the size of a dime coin compared to the stars. It was moving in a straight line.  Then it swerved into a circle like a double u-turn, and disappeared completely.  I could tell it was flying in the sky, and not in space. I saw it for about four seconds from the time it reflected off my glassdoor to the time it disappeared. It didn't make any noise, and it didn't leave any kind of trail.  It was no doubt a UFO from out of this world. My girlfriend also saw the whole thing, and when it was over we were speechless.  We didn't know how to comprehend what just happened.  After about 20 seconds of holding eachother after it happened, still looking at the sky, my exact words were, what the fuck was that!  I don't remember if she said anything back to me.  We went inside, and didn't go back outside for the rest of the night. We didn't really talk to eachother for the rest of the night either. Just writing this has been giving me the chills, and it was over three years ago that it happened.;34.1645;-87.7397
