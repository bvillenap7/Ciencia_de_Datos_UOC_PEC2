Me and my superviser stepped outside (cloudy day), and to the north of us was a large perfect circle of lights that flashed all around in a synchronized fashion, me and him stared at it in amazment as it glided through the air, me and him have never in our lives seen anything like it.  It had maybe 15 to 20 lights all the way around (no physical aircraft was visible), from where we were standing the object would have had to have been rather large.  We couldn't tell how high it was but it was completely silent.  It was moving from east to the west, he called his parents and told them to get a camera and go outside as they lived about 5 miles away from where the object should have been flying directly over but they never saw anything, we still do not know what we saw and everyone we have discussed this with has not said anything about seeing this object.;30.4772;-87.6901
