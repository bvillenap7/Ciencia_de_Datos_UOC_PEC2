Around 100 ft. long and 50-75 ft. wide. 	My brother, grandmother, and I were going up the mountain in Fort Payne and we saw a triangular craft.  It was close to one hundred feet long and maybe fifty to seventy-five feet wide and it was silver.  We drove along watching it and lost track of it about fifteen minutes later.  We got up around Fyffe and we saw a large fire.  My grandmother got worried and called 911 to report/ask if there were any aircraft crashes.  The 911 operator said, No, there havenâ€™t been any crashes reported. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.
