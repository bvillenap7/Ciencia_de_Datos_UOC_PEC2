Red light seen moving slowly left,right and rapidly vertically up and down.;2015-11-16 19:30:00;20 minutes;red light  seen moving slowly left,right and rapidly vertically up and down. On 11/16/15 about 7:30 pm myself, my sister-in-law & her daughter were walking her dogs. It was dark, light overcast and very windy.  When reaching the intersection of Hamilton Drive and Crystal Lake Drive we spotted a large, bright red light against the mountain.  My first thought was it was a car's tail lights visible on a mountain road, but then realized there were no mountain roads in that area. The light moved up the mountain side seemingly following the slope and then back down to approximately its original elevation and began blinking a small green light from the lower side of the red light.  It began to move left, right, back left and then rapidly ascended to an altitude approximately the height of the mountain, estimate 500 feet in about 5 seconds.  Then it rapidly descended back to its original altitude. The light slowly descended from that point behind a tree line as if landing and was not seen again. No craft shape could be seen as the red light dominated. The event lasted approximately 20 minutes.;34.4418737704919;-85.716524590164
