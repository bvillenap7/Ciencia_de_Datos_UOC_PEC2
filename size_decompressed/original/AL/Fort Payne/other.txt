Strange light in east near fort payne, al.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD));2013-02-03 20:00:00;all night;Strange light in east near fort payne,al I began seeing a strange star like light in winter of last year.  It comes out of the east over looking lookout mountain and tracks north movement is slow but deliberate.  I just want to know what it is star satellite or whatever.  It usually pulsates red and blue colors but it changes frequency and color through different times of the night.  Sometimes blue and purple sometimes green.  But it is easier to see than all the stars.   A seperate sighting of a completely different kind occured last December around 3 a.m..  I was duck hunting on the tennesse river near Stevenson, AL, roughly 50 miles northwest of fort payne.  I saw a gold light to the east moving very erraticly it even appeared to be dancing at times.  The sighting lasted around 30 minutes before descending out of sight behind the mountains ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD));34.4418737704919;-85.716524590164
