Unidentified Black and Red, Rectangular Flying Object;2018-04-04 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;Unidentified Black and Red, Rectangular Flying Object After picking up my husband from work, and driving home through the main street in town, we suddenly saw passing directly over and in front of our car a rectangular black object with the short side of the craft on both ends lit up in a red bar shape with a smaller blinking red light behind it.   We immediately pulled over to get out of the car to get a better view.  We were amazed that there was no sound at all while smoothly gliding past us.  It then proceeded to descend at a downward angle, then appeared to go straight down.  We couldn't see exactly where it went at that point because of the buildings and houses blocking our view. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the wife, and we found her to be quite eloquent, sober-minded, and matter-of-fact, in her description of the object.  We invited her to submit an illustration of the object.  PD));34.4418737704919;-85.716524590164
