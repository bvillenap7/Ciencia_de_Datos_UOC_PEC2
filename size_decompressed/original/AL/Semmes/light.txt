PD));2009-07-25 21:40:00;Approx. 10 min.;I saw a star-sized light emerge over a tree-line approximately 30 feet from me (trees about 30-50 feet tall). At first, I took it to be a satellite, and I went inside to get my wife. While she was coming outside, I noticed that it was much too bright and much too fast to be a satellite.  It was not moving as fast as a shooting star, but it was definitely moving more quickly than any satellite I had ever seen.  My wife came outside, and we watched it slowly fade into a shade of red before fading completely.  We lost sight of it for a few seconds before spotting either a second similar object or the same object a good distance away from where we originally saw it.  Whether it was the same object or a second object, it behaved the same with it fading into a shade of red before totally fading.   I scanned the sky for a good while afterwards but could not locate it again. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.  PD));30.7544;-88.266
