Saw bright green flash of light in southern sky falling straight down. Could have been traveling toward me. Fell behind trees before I could get a good look at it.;30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032
Green Fireball;2007-11-08 23:15:00;5 seconds;Green Fireball Me and a friend saw something around 11:15 to 11:45pm Mobile, AL in the eastern sky it was massive, it lasted maybe 3-5 seconds before it pretty much fell out of the sky definatly heading south-ish.  This thing looked big enough to be a flare or a firework, but was definantly neither of the above. http://tomsastroblog.com/?p=938  others spotted this object but I cannot locate anything official from any agency which seems odd as I'd like to imagine we have radars to detect this type of activity.;30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032
Orange fireballs for 3 days at the same time of day each day, with some weird stuff happening after.((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2017-02-02 18:30:00;1 hour;orange fireballs for 3 days at the same time of day each day, with some weird stuff happening after For the past 3 days I have watched the same thing happen in the south west skies about 500 feet off the grond. It seems to be some type of orange fire ball that sometimes is only 1 ball and then others up to 6.  The object would only light up for a min then fade away without any noise at all.  At first I thought it could have been a flare until it reappeared with  2 , 4 or 6 of the same shape and color objects and the objects have showed up like clock work every afternoon just as the sun is going down and always in the same general area but were obviously not planes or anything I've  ever seen and where I live is near two airports one is only a few miles away so I know what an aircraft looks like and where they were wasn't in the direction as the airport.  Now the first day it caught my eye because there were 4 of them and they all had long tails moving out to the side of it before disappearing.  Tonight After the craft had flickered out the last time a helicopte! r showed up and circled the area for about 30 minutes before it took off over the gulf and never returned. I have seen other craft almost as amazing as this one in the same general area of the sky within the last 6 months also but they were red and blue flickering lights and then shot up into the sky like a bullet.  Before I go I don't know if it means anything although I think its strange but each time I have seen these objects I just seem to find myself going outside for no reason it almost feels as though I am being called outside and the second night I saw these things I went to bed and none of my dogs would come to bed (we all sleep in the same room) about two hours after I saw it I woke up with this strange beeping noise in my room and I sat up to see this strange green and red light in a human like shape floating off the ground and about 4 foot tall and then it vanished. I laid back down feeling strange and then I felt my bed sink in rite in the middle of the bed and ! I got a strange and terrified feeling then I felt like I passe! d out , but I don't know if I did or not. Then I saw these flashes in my head of these weird looking kids with big eyes and blond almost white hair that looked like it was falling out or something. This is really bothering me I have never had anything like this happen before so I would really like to find out what in the Hell was I looking at! I tried to take video its really crappy but I am sure I got at least 1 still shot;30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032
Orange, slow-moving fireball seen near Bayou Sara River, Mobile, AL. (2 witnesses);2019-09-24 21:30:00;1 minute;Orange, slow-moving fireball seen near Bayou Sara River, Mobile, AL. (2 witnesses) Friend and I went on a boat ride to a sandbar we know at approx. 7:00 PM in Bayou Sara. We left at (estimated) 7:30 PM, headed North back towards Gunnison River. I looked eastward and spotted what seemed to be a orange/ yellow ball of fire moving incredibly slowly towards the south. I drew my friends attention to the object, to which after a few seconds of watching it said my thoughts exactly, “what the f*ck is that dude?”. I estimated it to be 2 miles away, 2,000 feet high, and moving towards the south at around 40 mph. We observed it moving for around 40 seconds, after which it appeared to dim and burn out over he course of 3-4 seconds.  I remained unlit for 10 seconds or so and appeared to re-ignite itself back to its original luminosity. Moving the same speed and direction as before for 5-6 seconds, I appeared to dim itself for the final time, after which we never saw it again.  There were no clouds in the sky, it was entirely clear at that hour.  The objec! t had no blinking lights. The object also made no noise.  Within 5 minutes we counted 4 helicopters and 3 jets flying over the objects general area, which we had not seen a single one the entirety that we were out there on the river. It appeared that they were scrambled to intercept the object.;30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032
