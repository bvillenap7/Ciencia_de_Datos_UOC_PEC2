Persistant, stationary white roundish object. Remained in sky for approx 45 min before graying out and disappeared.;2013-10-08 18:30:00;45 minutes;Persistant, stationary white roundish object. Remained in sky for approx 45 min before graying out and disappeared. On 08 October 2013, at approximately 1730, I was on way to attend a state representive forum in Tillmans Corners which is WSW and just outside of Mobile, AL.  I had stopped at an intersection waiting for a red light facing north when my attention was captured by a white oval/roundish object.  This object was about a little over 3 fists above the horizon with luminosity equal to or a bit brighter than the moon.  The size was about ¼” to 1/3” comparatively speaking.  What fascinated me most at the time was that it remained stationary.  I didn’t take a photo at the time because my impression was that it was a blimp even though it was rounder than that.  I figured it maybe it was the angle disguising such an obvious shape.  Besides I was driving in a new area looking for the building where the forum was to take place so I dismissed it from my mind.  I found the building a few minutes later and decided I had time to get a bite to eat. After eating, I was returning via the same route 30-40 minutes later. At the same intersection I glanced up to the spot where I had seen this anomaly and it was still there! Making a left and arriving at my destination a few blocks over, I parked and got out my car. I stayed outside for another five or so minutes continually watching this object. I wanted to take a picture, but thought it would be unimpressive and when I decided to take one anyway, it turned a bluish gray and disappeared!   Again thinking maybe it was blimp, I thought I should at least see something slighter darker the clear sky color to indicate a shadow or something but there was nothing.  I waited a few minutes more but nothing further other the than the clear sky. It ended about 1925. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Sorry about that, it would be October 08, 2013. So used to military expressions of date. The object was larger than Venus and smaller than a full moon.  I would say the size of an eraser end of a pencil would be about right.

Oval thing flying ahead with bright lights.;2016-02-03 22:00:00;1 second;Oval thing flying ahead with bright lights. I was out on a walk with my friend, it was a little late and we both were pretty tired, but had had a long day and wanted to look at the stars.  They were amazing that night. When suddenly we saw a large oval thing fly up above, as it passed a couple of the street lights just went completely out.   It had and odd haze sort of cloudiness around it, maybe like a shield?  And it was a bit hard to see exactly what it looked like past the haze around it, but I know it had some for of lights on.  It went right past, never slowed, but it scared the hell out of me and my friend. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
