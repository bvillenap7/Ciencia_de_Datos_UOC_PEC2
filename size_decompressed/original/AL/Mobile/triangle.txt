The road was practically empty And i always have enjoyed looking at the stars on my way home,  But this time i saw about 8 different looking stars.  They had a triangular shape witch is what really got me looking at them.  Since i was driving, i couldn't tell if it was because i was in a moving truck that the stars seemed to move quite a bit.   I pulled over to the side of the road and stared a little longer.  After watching them for about a minute i knew it wasn't a star, and definitely not planes.  I knew they werent planes because they seemed to move in circular motions.  And i was damn sure planes dont look yellow at night.   Thats when i knew it had to be a UFO. I hope i gave a good and helpful description. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032
