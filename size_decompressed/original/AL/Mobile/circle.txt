Bright circular object floating across the Mobile, AL sky;2019-11-10 16:26:00;30 minutes;Bright circular object floating across the Mobile, AL sky It began when my wife and I were standing in our backyard enjoying the nice afternoon weather we were having.  I am a private pilot myself and we live below an approach into KBFM that is used when the winds are out of the south so I am looking up into the sky quite often to see what types of aircraft are flying.  Being a private pilot with more than 100 hrs flying and an aviation enthusiast in general I am quite competent at identifying aircraft.  My wife is a homemaker with little experience in aviation other than the occasional vacation, but living in our area and like I said under an approach she still sees quite a bit of aircraft.  My location at the time of the sighting was 30 deg 42' 20 N by 88 deg 8' 10 W.  I was facing 320 deg. when I first saw it and the object was tracking a SE course.  I looked up into the NW sky and I saw what at first I thought was a small cloud due to the color.  It was very bright.  Then I realized there were no clouds in the sky on this particular day.  It was hard to say what altitude the object was at.  If I was to give a number it would be a total guess.  I began to notice that this object was actually moving across the sky.  It was moving very slowly about the speed a blimp flies.  No way an airplane could fly this slowly and still be able to produce lift.  There was no sound associated with this craft.  My wife and I stood there and watched it until it crossed behind the roof of my house.  So I ran to my front porch to continue watching.  From my front porch I have a massive unobstructed view of the sky.  I can see for miles.  I stood at my front door watching this object for maybe 5 minutes and I decided that given the speed the object was moving I could run inside to grab a drink and return and still see the object.  After quen! ching my thirst I returned to the front porch to find and empty sky.  There was no way at the speed it was traveling that it could have gotten out of my view in the short time I was inside.  The object never reappeared.  I will include pictures I was able to take of the craft.  My pictures will be in the email titled Mobile, AL Sighting.  Some of them are zoomed in and the object looks pretty weird.  All of the zoomed in pictures show some sort of tentacle looking object protruding from the craft.  It is hard to tell if these are just camera quality problems or if something is really there, but they do appear in multiple shots.;30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032
Orange Light Over Mobile AL;2021-05-09 23:30:00;3 min;Orange Light Over Mobile AL On Mother's Day 2021 , An orange object caught my attention at 23:30 while I was sitting outside. It was orange and bigger than the average star . The object was moving through the sky freely  . Also it had no sound of an aircraft . My cousin and I saw it once it disappeared and left us in disbelief. Shortly It came back zapping across the sky again flashing and teleporting . We tried to face time and call others outside to see but it disappeared into the sky.;30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032
