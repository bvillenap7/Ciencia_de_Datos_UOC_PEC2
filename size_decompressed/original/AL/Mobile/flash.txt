A bright flash that left a spot of light in my eye;2005-08-30 00:00:00;5 seconds;A bright flash that left a spot of light in my eye Our power was out due to hurricane Katrina. My wife and I were sitting in our driveway and I walked around the side of the house to check to see if anyone in the neighborhood had generator power.  All of a sudden a bright flash , such as a flashbuld, caught my eye .  The flash was in the South Eastern sky at about40 degrees in the sky.  The night was cloudless and the stars were so visible everywhere.  The light put a flash in my eye , such as a welders flash, and it still is there. When I walked back around to my wife, the first thing she said was, did you see that flash.  She was facing North at the time and only saw the sky light up for a split second.  It did not affect her, since she seen only the flash from behind her.  It lasted a split second and this is Friday and I still have the spot in my eye.;30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032
ufos playing in the night sky near the southern cross star cluster;2011-01-12 23:00:00;5 minutes;ufos playing in the night sky near the southern cross star cluster there are two visible stars north of the southern cross star cluster in the sky. I observed 2 flashes near these stars that made me pay attention.  I thought it might be aircraft at first, but the objects moved oddly in varied directions, like they were playing with each other.  I could tell they were extremely far away in the atmosphere.  they stayed in the general location, but eventially faded away. I would love to know what they are - i certainly can't explain it.;30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032
