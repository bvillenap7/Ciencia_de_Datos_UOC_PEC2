A string of what appeared to be about a dozen streetlights, but obviously were NOT. (Mobile, AL);1998-08-28 05:45:00;approx. 1 minute;A string of what appeared to be about a dozen streetlights, but obviously were NOT. (Mobile, AL) I was driving south down Rangeline Rd. about 20 minutes before sunrise, while the sky was still dark. As I was approaching the intersection at Hamilton Blvd., I had the window rolled down, enjoying the wind and casually gazing out at the landscape (due south, in the direction of Dauphin Island Parkway) as I was still about three blocks before the traffic light. It was as if they were purposely camouflaged as street lights, because I didn't even notice them at first. But then the last one at the end of the line, down closest to the intersection, appeared to be glowing about three times brighter than the others. As I focused directly on them at that point, I realized there weren't even any light poles along the road (it's a rural area), and these lights were actually a quarter to a half mile away. There was traffic both in front of and behind me, so I had to watch the road as I approached the intersection, and unfortunately, the traffic signal was green when I came to it, so I couldn't stop and stare. But I took one last lengthy gaze at that brightest one as I was rounding the street corner. There was a small clearing through the trees, and I got an excellent, last-second look at it as it had grown so intensely bright that it actually looked like a little sun in the distance. It had short rays of light shining from it it was so bright, with two prominent rays at each side, in the three o'clock and nine o'clock positions (edges of a disc?) Just as the trees were about to block my view, with amazingly synchronized timing, it suddenly faded to black, like a bright yard light going out.  Unlike most people who get excited when they only THINK they've seen a UFO, my initial reaction to this was denial, and I'm an open-minded person. Yet, it bothered me all day long at work that day, and then when I got off work at 2:30 PM, I looked out there in broad daylight, searching the skyline for any evidence of any kind of structure these lights would have been attached to, and there was nothing but trees. So I decided that, if they were anything that was supposed to be there, then they would be there again on the following morning. They were never there again. Except for that intensely glowing one at the end of the string, they all appeared about the size and color (yellowish) of streetlights, and they were the appropriate height and spaced apart like streetlights would be, so that nobody would have ever noticed unless they were paying as much attention as I was.  Another weird anomaly: when I got home that evening, I decided to do a web search and see if there were any UFO reports of craft similar to what I saw. Not even really expecting to find anything, I learned for the first time about Bob Lazar and his alleged back-engineering work at the secret base called S4, near Area 51. The site I found that evening is boblazar.com, and in the tape-transcripts section, I saw where Lazar says they glow at night, with the sodium yellow color of streetlights. He explains that they can actually warp space and disappear, so as you can imagine, I was even more stunned as I read this than I was when I first saw it in the sky for real that morning.

Strange lights moving effortlessly through the sky;2012-01-11 18:35:00;1;Strange lights moving effortlessly through the sky While traveling south on highway 90 in theTillmans corner area, I witnessed two lights. Initially I thought it was two jets both with afterburners on.  However then they both appeared to be falling or going away from me, when suddenly one went out.  I thought it may be a large flare, then the other went out, again I was perplexed so I thought maybe a cloud had gotten between us and blocked the view, realizing there were no clouds in the sky I dismissed it as them both burning out. One of them illuminated again, then the other, again I thought okay it was two afterburners, when unexpectedly one begins moving through the sky erratically.  I phoned my wife and began explaining to her what I was viewing, she initially dismissed it as an excuse because I was running late.   After getting off the phone the one that was flying erratically settled beside the other and the second one began to fly around for 10 seconds or so before settling near the other.  I reported it to you all the following morning.;30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032
Bright and silent LED-light like object drifting through evening sky, lights fade and object eventually disappears.;2013-11-07 18:30:00;~1 minute;Bright and silent LED-light like object drifting through evening sky, lights fade and object eventually disappears. This evening (7 November 2013), as I was returning to my dorm room, I briefly watched what I believe to be a UFO in the sky.  Shortly after 6:30 I was crossing a sports field and returning to the dorm.  I turned and looked over my shoulder at the moon and Jupiter (which was a little below the tree line) then I looked almost directly above me.  I noticed two stars, one of which was as bright as Jupiter.  I found this curious and became more intrigued when I noticed it moving.  I thought it was a plane because of the airport nearby but even the planes highest up can be heard eventually.  This made no noise, and had none of the usual lights you see on a plane.  The best I can describe it was like someone was holding a giant LED flashlight and pointing it towards the ground.   After a few seconds light went out the way an ember dies, yet I could still see it.  It was faint but obvious.  It looked like its shape was long, perhaps like a rectangle, with white lights not near! ly as bright as the initial light on either end.  After that, whether it flew up to  a higher altitude, left my range of vision, or was simply blotted out by the copper light in front of the building, I'm not quite sure, but it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the flare of light from an Iridium satellite confirmed.   http://heavens-above.com/IridiumFlares.aspx?lat=30.69417&lng=-88.04305&loc=Mobile&alt=3&tz=CST PD));30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032

It shot down, then disappeared out of the sky.   The most bizarre strange light I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witnesses elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Multiple craft with twinkling red lights.  Appear to fly in a grid.;2015-01-18 18:35:00;20 minutes;Multiple craft with twinkling red lights.  Appear to fly in a grid. Two pair of aircraft with twinkling red lights.   Two of the craft appear to be flying in a grid pattern at a very steady rate of speed.  First moving towards each other and after passing then moving away from each other.  One flying east and the other west.   The other two craft traveled out of view shortly after spotting them.   They are located south of the Mobile Regional Airport, but do not appear anything at all like planes that are in a holding pattern, or on an approach for landing.;30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032

Was walking dogs down street, at first glance thought It was a star then noticed it was hovering slowly and not but 200-300 feet off ground. Light moved slowly passed us, I had my flashlight in Hand and turned it towards the light.. after doing this the light vanished but I could still see something in the sky for about 5 seconds. The whole time we could not hear it make any sound, it was quiet.;30.6683097323601;-88.1623163017032
