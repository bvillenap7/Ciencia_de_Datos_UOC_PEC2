Fireballs flashing like fireworks on the Florida/Alabama state line 1/31/13.;2013-01-31 23:00:00;45 minutes off and on;Fireballs flashing like fireworks on the Florida/Alabama state line 1/31/13 I had a bizarre experience tonight on the Alabama/Florida state line. I was in the absolute middle of nowhere about 20 miles away from Milton, Florida when I saw four white fireballs in the sky. They were extremely close, fast, and made no noise at all whatsoever.  The fireballs would flash into the sky and then reform into balls of white light and fly around close to eachother. I pulled off the highway to see them as did other drivers.  They disappeared and I continued on my drive. Ten minutes later while driving I noticed a red orb of light slightly smaller than the white ones and more solid to the left of me seemingly going at my pace and following me.  While that was happening the white orbs were back and above me to the right in the sky doing the same thing as before- flaming/flashing into the sky and reforming into balls of white firey light all the while flying around. Again, they disappeared into thin air. So, the real kicker to this story is that I was almost home (Navarre, Florida) and I saw three of the white fireballs again and over ten light colored military tanks were pulling out of a side road heading towards where the balls of light were coming from.  I can't speculate that the military tanks were going to investigate this I just found the timing odd.;31.1294;-87.0961
