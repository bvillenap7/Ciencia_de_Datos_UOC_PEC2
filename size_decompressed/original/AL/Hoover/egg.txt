Green glowing object moving past me overhead.;2014-09-14 22:15:00;3-5 seconds;green glowing object moving past me overhead I was on the interstate and saw a green glow from an object in the sky.  It moved from behind me in the same direction I was traveling and disappeared past the tree line several miles ahead of me in only a few seconds.  It looked like there was a teardrop shape around an egg shape which may have been fire, but was all a green or jade color.;33.4164856875585;-86.7795896164642
