Neon green fireball with neon purple and blue tail.;2006-09-01 17:00:00;4 minutes;Neon green fireball with neon purple and blue tail. I was driving from a friend’s house to go home on Caldwell Mill Road in Hoover, AL, it was around 5pm in September 2006.  I was sitting in traffic and noticed a beautiful “fireball,” only the ball part was neon green, and it had a very long tail, which was neon purple and blue.  It went slowly overhead it took about 4 minutes to go across the sky and over the trees, then disappeared from my view.  It was beautiful.  I have never seen anything like it before.   I looked online and watched the news to see if it was some type of meteor, but still till this day I have yet to hear anything about it.
