I saw the same thing a few minutes later. I was out with the dog looking at the stars when I noticed a point of light looking just like a star moving very fast almost directly above. No trail, sound, blinking lights, just a point of light. I thought it was a satellite or the space station and went inside to tell the wife to hurry outside. I then went back outside looking for it but did not see anything. I knew it was moving so fast it would already be past the trees. Then from the same point in the sky I saw a point of light take off in the same direction. This time I watched it till is vanished overhead. It got very dim and disappeared. From my experience it was nothing like a meteor. I did not think it was strange at the first time, but when I went back outside and saw the same thing again that was weird. I just wished I had watched it the first time to see if it slowly disappeared.;33.4164856875585;-86.7795896164642
White light that appeared as comet but changed shape and slowed down.;2012-08-22 19:00:00;8 minutes;White light that appeared as comet but changed shape and slowed down. It was around 7:20 PM and the sun was starting to set, so it was still really bright outside.  And there was this bright light that caught the corner of my eye that was close to the moon, and it started off looking like a comet.  Then it began to curve downward and it was still going pretty fast, then it started to slow down and as it was still going down it started to change shape to look like a star. I thought this object was going to take the place of a star because of the slow pace it was going, but it was still moving and started going down in a slight zig zag motion.  Then it changed direction again and started to go off into the distance.  And I know it wasn't a plane because what plane needs its lights on while the sun is still up? It would appear black or gray, not a glowing white orb that was at an altitude that seemed too high for a plane.
