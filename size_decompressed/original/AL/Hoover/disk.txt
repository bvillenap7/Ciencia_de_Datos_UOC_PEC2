I went outside to look for my cat, who has been missing for several hours.  In the southwestern sky I saw there was a bright blue saucer hovering around.  It had a bright blue beam of light coming from the bottom of it, spanning outwards.  It hovered around and appeared to  be moving away from my house towards the south.;33.4164856875585;-86.7795896164642
