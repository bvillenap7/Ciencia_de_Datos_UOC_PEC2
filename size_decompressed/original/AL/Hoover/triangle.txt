triangle of white and red lights;2004-08-10 21:23:00;several seconds;triangle of white and red lights As we were driving back from fueling up my daughter's car before school tomorrow, I saw lights through the tops of the trees.  A few seconds later, when we came to a stop sign and a clearing, I saw the strange-looking thing flying SE to NE not too high up in the sky.  It was composed of four white lights and two red lights, none of which were flashing, and it was traveling quite fast.  It seems like it would have been triangular in shape with one white light at the forward point, three white lights in a row behind it, and the two red lights at the opposite back corners.  There were no green lights and no 'headlights' that we frequently see on aircraft landing at this time of night.  At arm's length, it was about the size of the end joint of my thumb (about one inch).  A pure guess about altitude would be about 1,000 feet.  It seemed really close, to me, closer than aircraft usually fly.  I certainly would love to know what it was.  If you'd like, I'll mail a drawing.;33.4164856875585;-86.7795896164642
triangle in the air in front of Bluff Park School flew towards the valley and vanished ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2005-02-23 19:30:00;seconds;triangle in the air in front of Bluff Park School flew towards the valley and vanished My sister and I were driving to aikido training.  Right before we got to Bluff Park Elementary School, we saw very bright lights in the sky moving right to left about 150 feet in the air.  We thought it was an airplane.  It was so low it looked it was going to land, but we are 16 miles from the nearest airport.  When the lights came across in front of the car, we saw that it was a large triangle the size of a jet liner.  It was gray and the bright lights were lined up along the edges of the triangle.  Right after we saw it, it vanished.  It was pouring rain but didn't look like it went into the clouds because, as bright as it was, we would have seen the lights shining throught the clouds for at least a few more seconds.  Instead, it simply vanished.  I called my mom right then to tell her.  She said that it would have gone over our house from the direction it was traveling seconds before we saw it, but she never heard anything.  We never heard anything either, although the transmission in my car suddenly slipped very hard and the car hesitated when the triangle went over us.  There were only white lights on it, no red or green or any other color. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));33.4164856875585;-86.7795896164642

I'm 21 and i'm not supposed to be the crazy one in the family. My mom and I had just left the hospital(UAB) where we where visiting my brother, my mom was driving the land rover and I was in the front passenger seat. We are in Hoover, AL near Birmingham. Ok so we where headed south on I65 and we saw it just as we passed the Alford Ave exit on the right just above the trees.It was triangular shaped with bright white lights on the sides and a red blinking light on the bottom. We thought it was some kind of tower but since we didn't remember a tower being there we got off two exits down and took HWY 31 back toward Alford Ave. The thing was gone in the 10 mins or less that it took to turn around.it was around 9:00 PM mabey a little before.
