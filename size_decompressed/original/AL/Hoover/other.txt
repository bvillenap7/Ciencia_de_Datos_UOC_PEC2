slow moving Fireball in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible contrail, we suspect.  PD));2005-12-21 17:00:00;15 min;slow moving Fireball in the sky I was driving down Lorna Rd when I saw what looked like an orange commet falling from the sky.  It was orange. It had a rather long (what looked like) fire flame following it. To be honest, if I heard on the news that what I saw was an airplane that blew up in the sky and was on fire as it descended, I would believe it. Granted it had to be a rather LARGE fire as I could see the item on fire and it was WAY up in the sky. If it was space garbage, It was HUGE space garbage as the tail was long, almost like a shooting star that went real slow. It fell downward. I saw all of this with a nake eye.  It traveled very slow. It was not a plane smoke trail. I called my employees at the Hoover office. THey saw it as well and could not guess what it was as none of us had seen anything like this before. I watched it for about 10 - 15 min before it disappeared out of my viewing area ((NUFORC Note:  Possible contrail, we suspect.  PD));33.4164856875585;-86.7795896164642
2 different ships 2 different days;2006-04-16 09:54:00;4 min;2 different ships 2 different days Was driving down 459 heading east with my girlfriend and was watching this light in the distance. Didn't look like anything I have seen before. I started to slow down on the interstate to get a better look and it was getting closer. As it passed over head around 500 feet above I pulled over the car. I couldn't really see the shape of the object other than the light formations underneath. The lights were in a plus formation with 7 white lights total. The light were a dome shape (kinda like one of those battery dome push lights.) Being around 500 feet above me I would say that each dome was as least 6 feet in diameter. I rolled down my window to see if I could hear anything and it was dead silent. The ship was moving probably around 5 miles an hour. Maybe even slower. Saying I could have ran across the interstate about the same speed as it was traveling. The ship was heading toward Bessemer. Two days later I was in hueytown and for about 5 sec saw another ship that was a diamond shape color bright blue under the diamond there was a U cut out shape. Was moving east to west very fast and very straight. Was almost like the U shape underneath the ship was traveling on an invisible rail. The color of the ship was changing from red, yellow only on the bottom U part. The rest of the ship was bright blue. Had 5 people see this ship. One was a church lady and just could not believe her eyes.;33.4164856875585;-86.7795896164642
Giant Mettalic/Silver almost transparent craft seen over Caldwell Mill Road and ValleyDale Rd;2011-07-29 17:20:00;2 minutes;Giant Mettalic/Silver almost transparent craft seen over Caldwell Mill Road and ValleyDale Rd Coming from work from Highway 280 at the corner or Valleydale Rd and Caldwell Mill Rd, a craft appreared in BROAD DAYLIGHT way above and started dropping very fast.  At fist it looked like some type of airplane that was about to crash.  Then we noticed it was not an airplane, helicopter, blimp, balloon or any variation of either.  Additionally, we noticed that as it was descending very fast that it was moving sideways, actually different from the direction the main part of the craft was pointing.  Then is stopped in mid-air. I mean a complete stop.  There was traffic but it was pretty close to the tree line and a craft that big should have made some noise. The size I would say would be roughly equivalent to a commercial air liner and the color was a metallic/silvery almost transparent color. Almost camouflaged to be honest.  Depending on which angle you were looking into the sun, I doubt that everybody could have seen it.  We videoed a few seconds on if on ou! r Android X phones then it disappeared.  We were very happy that we got the video, only to learn seconds later that the video was corrupted.  I am a seasoned Software Engineer than have much experience in video/audio and I could not get that video to play in any way for any reason. This was even after I downloaded it from the phones and tried some other video editing. It was utterly and totally unusable.  This would make the 3rd craft I have seen and the 1st one she has seen. This one however looked nothing like the other two.  This one was shaped kind of like a giant bird type shape with wings slightly folded back and a raised front. I researched secret military planes that night and didn't find anything even remotely close, especially anything metallic/silver and that would be almost transparent in broad daylight.
