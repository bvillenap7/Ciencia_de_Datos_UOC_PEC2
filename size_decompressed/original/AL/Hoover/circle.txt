There were other neighbors who witnessed this as well.   The objects were moving faster than an airplane or helicopter, they were absolutely silent, had some sort or red/orange glowing halo (for a lack of a better word.   They rapidly flew for quite a distance - from North East to South West, came to an abrupt halt, then appeared to quickly descend at an angle and vanished.   I was quite shaken and have not slept all night.   I have been on my pc all night trying to find some news regarding what we witnessed.   It is now 6:50 am Central Standard Time.;33.4164856875585;-86.7795896164642
