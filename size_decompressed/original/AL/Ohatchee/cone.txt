When we looked outside we saw an ice cream-shaped craft hovering over the top of the trees. The top part seems to rotate and the bottom part stood still, it looked as if it had windows between the top and bottom part of the craft. I called my husband who was working in security 3rd shift at the time and reported the incident to him. We observed the craft for about five minutes before it shot out of sight in the blink of an eye. The only sound we heard was the dogs howling in a low tone. The strange thing was the dogs had their heads hanging downwards instead of looking up at the craft.;33.775;-86.0238
