I had just passed the East Alabama Medical Center, ( a hospital). I was in front of the fire station located next to the hospital and along US Highway 431, when to my immediate front and slightly to my left, there appeared in the sky, almost 1/4 way up on the horizon, a very large, round flash of light.  It appeared no longer than 2 seconds. I looked to the clock in my Jeep Cherokee and it was 11:11 pm. There is no communication tower in that location. I had my window down and heard no explosion. I continued going north on Hwy 431 going home.  It had rained all day, but now there was only a light drizzle.  I saw nothing else until I was completely out of town. Traveling north I now noticed a large white glow behind the clouds looking back in the direction where I had earlier seen the flash.  This was to my left and to the west.  The position of the glow would have been over Opleika where I saw the flash. Then suddenly to my front, again the north, a very large 'V' shape flashed in the sky just over the tree tops, again about 1/4 way up from the horizon.  It was a very wide and yellow-white flash that lasted about 2-3 seconds. It was very plain!  It seemed to be less than a mile in front of me.  The shape of the 'V' reminded me of Texas Long Horn cow horns.  The ends of the 'v' curved slightly upward. It was perfect shaped on both sides, I mean both sides were identical. I looked at the clock and it was 11:28.  I began looking for a mile marker sign and the first one I saw was mile marker 148.;32.6391392366415;-85.3732245801529
