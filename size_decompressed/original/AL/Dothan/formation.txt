Tonight, 6/11/16, at approximately 21:30 or so, while sitting outside our apartment building in Dothan, Alabama, my friend and I saw a wide cluster of twinkling lights rise up over the buildings downtown, and move in formation across the sky towards us.  Over 50 plus lights of various sizes, or maybe size variance in individual lights created by individual distance from us, created the illusion of different sizes.  They moved very slowly and the whole incident lasted about 5 minutes.  The cluster was very similar to a fireworks burst, only it didn't dissipate.  There was no sign of smokiness as with fireworks.  Each light was distinct and singular and moving in formation over the buildings and trees and then, still moving very slowly, moved straight up into the dark evening clouds.  One of the lights broke formation and traveled downwards very slowly then blinked out.  The cluster was still visible among the evening clouds but barely.  Then eventually faded and disappeared altogether.  This is real.  It did happen.  It was very exciting and scary at the same time!  My friend and I really want to know what those lights were and why they were visible over downtown Dothan!;31.2065039473682;-85.4118411654135
