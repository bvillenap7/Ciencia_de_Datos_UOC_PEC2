On Feb 16, 2009 at 1850 hrs I walked out onto my front porch to go to my car my dog was raising cane so I was a little scared when for no apparent reason I looked up at the sky and there were three white lights flying together in a V shaped formation. They flew together one broke off to the right and became stationary the other two continued together until they blended in the sky with the other stars.I have no idea what it was because i dont believe in things like this but i know what i saw.It only lasted about 15 seconds I still cant believe what i saw was real. there has to be an explanation.;31.2065039473682;-85.4118411654135
