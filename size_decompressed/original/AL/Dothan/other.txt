Multiple white horizontal UFOs stationary NE of Dothan, AL;2008-06-01 17:00:00;10 min.;Multiple white horizontal UFOs stationary NE of Dothan, AL Drove from Jacksonville, FL to Dothan, AL for work. Got out of truck and started to stretch. While stretching I looked up to the NE and saw a small horizontal white line sitting dead still at very high altitude.  It caught my eye and when I really focused on it I noticed that there were 13 to 15 of them scattered about in no particular formation.   Went to room to drop off luggage and when I looked again they were gone.  Objects were very high saw airliner flying at similar altitude and believe the objects were a little larger than the passenger plane.;31.2065039473682;-85.4118411654135
