I witnessed a color-shiftin object in the sky of Alabama when I was star-gazing.;2003-09-25 20:30:00;15 minutes;I witnessed a color-shiftin object in the sky of Alabama when I was star-gazing. I was laying in my front yard, stargazing, when I saw a light in  Orion's belt. It was a sort of pinkish-purple color with a greenish az around it, and it shifted from that color to blue, and back again. It moved eastward rapidly, leaving a scattering of white specks behind it, like more, smaller craft. Then in a flash of light, it vanished. I had the distinct impression that they had been trying to mentally contact me, because I seemed to have been hearing a sort of haunting music that was coming from no external source during the whole incident. ((NUFORC Note:  The dramatically bright, twinkling star, Sirius, is just to the left of Orion's Belt.  PD));31.2065039473682;-85.4118411654135
Saw a big light in sky moving a bit and then it left VERY quickly.;2004-11-12 20:00:00;30 seconds;Saw a big light in sky moving a bit and then it left VERY quickly. I was outside my apartment toward the parking lot smoking a cigarette with my husband.  My 2 children (9 & 1) were there as well.  Over the neighboring apartment complex I saw what I at first thought was a very bright star.  I noticed that it was slowly moving so my next inclination was to think that it was a plane as we live only a few miles froma small airport.  But it was moving much too slowly to be a plane so close to us.  I called my husband's attention to it.  It would stop moving then move a little and so on.  Then it SHOT off....gone just like that.  It was gone so quickly that I thought it had to have been covered up by a fast moving cloud.  But I looked around at the sky and there were no clouds.  It was weird.

A comet type object in night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));2007-12-10 18:10:00;One minute;A comet type object in night sky. I went outside to replace a fuse in my Christmas lights. The time was between 18:10 and 18:40 .I was conscious of the time because I had to take my son to school for a function at 18:40. I looked up in the sky and saw what I first took to be a comet, but I did not think there were any comets around.  I then decided that it was just a star and distortion from my glasses lenses was causing me to see a tail. Normally if an object is distorted by my lenses I can look dead on at an object and the distortion will clear. In this case however, no matter what direction I looked at the object, the tail remained. I was in a hurry and just decided that because this thing definitely had a tail I guess that I had missed the fact on the news that there was comet visible in the night sky. I then justified this decision by thinking that I remembered hearing on the radio about a comet.  The object looked to me very similar Hale Bopp. I did not study it for more than a few minutes, knew it was out of place, then justified why and went about my business. It had enough impact on me to look for it again, when I went to unplug my Christmas lights, but I could not locate it. I didn’t think much of it until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast To Coast. Sorry I didn’t study the object closer. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));31.2065039473682;-85.4118411654135

Hard to estimate, but there appeared to be approximately 75 to 100 of them.  They were moving in a northeasterly direction.  They made no discernable noise.;31.2065039473682;-85.4118411654135
Bright light near Dothan, Alabama sighted moving southward at extreme speed.;2017-04-15 20:00:00;45 seconds;Bright light near Dothan, Alabama sighted moving southward at extreme speed. About an hour ago, while walking my dog, I looked to the southwest and noticed what I thought was an airplane flying towards Panama City.   The object was very bright and moving faster than a commercial flight could, and after 30 seconds, or so, dimmed and disappeared completely. I am curious if anyone else saw this.
