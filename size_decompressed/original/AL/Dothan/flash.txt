blinking lights;2009-10-15 23:00:00;20 minutes;blinking lights Me and my boyfriend were both outside enjoying the weather one night and when we decided to take out or trash we noticed this blinking light extremely brighter than all other stars in the sky.  It flashed from red to blue to green.  We stared at it for a minute or so and it moved maybe an inch in my perspective every two or three minutes.  We decided to see if we could see anymore so we turned around looking in the sky.  We found a total of four in a diamond pattern but very far apart.  We looked online to see if we could find any answers since we were obviously a little spooked but found nothing. It could have possibly been a star but we didnt figure that there would be four of them in such a pattern that was an exact diamond.;31.2065039473682;-85.4118411654135
