Hovering fireball in Dothan, AL.;2014-02-22 19:00:00;2 minutes;Hovering fireball in Dothan, AL We were driving and noticed a hovering fireball.  I thought it may have been an airplane on fire, but it was just a ball shape.   My husband and I could both see what looked to be a glow coming from fire or flames.  It didn't emit much light into the surrounding sky, and was well below the cloud line.   The sky was clear, and we could tell the object was much closer than other stars, or the altitude at which an airplane would have been flying.   The object didn't move forward, backward, or anything.  It just seemed to hover and we drove right under it.;31.2065039473682;-85.4118411654135
