Possible UFO in the South;2008-04-20 18:45:00;5 minutes;Possible UFO in the South Interesting object.  I was outside near sunset and I saw what I first thought was a bird but the motion was odd and the object was much larger.  There were birds in the sky at the same time.  It was traveling from West to East.  At about 1500 - 3000 feet, but this was hard to tell. It was a very dark, black object. I could tell it was diamond shaped.  It was rolling and flipping as it traveled along.  It maintained altitude and heading as if it was on a direct path.  The was no sound.  There was no exhaust.  And it maintained a relativly constant speed.  Not very fast and slower than a light aircraft in flight.  The rolling and flipping motion is what I found odd.  I first thought it was a huge bird, but I could see it was not a bird after it past by. My next thought was that it could be possibly be a balloon, but, again, after it passed by, I could tell it was not.  It was a very dense, dark object.  And it was diamond shaped. There were no lights or anything luminuos. I have no idea what it was.  I was hoping the local news media might have had some reports of this, but it appears not.  So I would have to say what I saw tonight would be classified as a unidentified flying object.  I am hoping though someone else reported something similar as this object headed east.;31.2065039473682;-85.4118411654135
Diamond shaped silent object floating over Dothan, AL;2009-09-16 21:54:00;4 minutes;Diamond shaped silent object floating over Dothan, AL It was 9:54 pm.  I was out in the backyard with the dogs.  I happened to look up and saw a triangle of lights headed my way.   There were three lights: two red and one white.  It seemed to be floating above the tree line.  I first thought it might be helicopters flying in formation, but there was no sound.  It seemed to be only one or possibly two football field lengths away.  When it turned, I saw a third red light that made it the shape of a diamond.  Only one light was blinking.  The other three stayed on constantly.   I watched in amazement until it went behind the trees.  I watched and waited for it to clear the trees.  When it did, I saw it turn around and head back the way it had come.  I was speechless.  What can turn around like that?    When it went behind the trees again, I ran into the house for my camera.  I was going to take a picture when it reappeared, but it never did.;31.2065039473682;-85.4118411654135
