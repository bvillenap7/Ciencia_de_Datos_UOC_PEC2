Intense bright, spherical white light over Auburn University campus ~9:30pm 2/25/07;2007-02-25 21:30:00;~ 5 seconds;Intense bright, spherical white light over Auburn University campus ~9:30pm 2/25/07 I had just finished the main leg of my run and was walking back to my apartment when I ran into a buddy of mine.  We were chatting for about 5 minutes right in front of my apartment when an incredibly bright, white ball of light suddenly appeared about 100 feet (rough approximation) in the air, seemingly out of nowhere. It looked like a perfectly round sphere, of a pure white light (a white like none I have ever seen before), and had a white tail of light that tapered of at the end.   It was traveling in a north-western direction, was totally silent, and quickly disappeared.  It only lasted about 5 seconds but I saw it clearly as I was facing its direction.  My friend only saw it out of the corner of his eye.  We went walking in the direction that it was headed, since it looked like it was going to crash into the ground, to see if we could find anything.  However we didn’t see much nor did we run into anyone else who we could ask if they had also seen it.  We only walked about a block though.  My first impression was a missile (due to the fact that we have frequent military aircraft flybys) or a firework.  But it couldn’t have been either because of the nature of its appearance.  I don’t know what it was but I am thoroughly excited by the sighting. Since it was requested, I am a skeptical individual but have a desire to believe. I can’t claim that it was a UFO since I know very little about the nature of sightings and what-not.  As a kid, though, I was obsessed with them.  My friend didn’t seem too interested and also seemed a bit entertained by my speculations over what it could have been.;32.560896013289;-85.4787073089699
Two bright, non-moving lights in the sky, brighter than the stars.;2009-07-20 09:30:00;1 minute;Two bright, non-moving lights in the sky, brighter than the stars. A friend and myself were standing outside of his house, which is in a subdivision.  We were looking in the sky attempting to identify constellations, studying for an astronomy class.  There is a significant amount of light pollution in the area.  I was looking north or northwest, and my friend was looking southeast.  He mentioned that I should look where he was looking.  I looked southeast.  We both observed two extremely bright points of light.  One light appeared vertically above the other light.  They were not moving at all.  My first impression was that they were just extremely bright stars, and I looked into my book to try to find them.  I looked back up a few seconds later and they were gone.  There was no sound.  Both points of light were the same brightness, and appeared to be much brighter than any star in the sky.;32.560896013289;-85.4787073089699
