Blue Star object seen hovering above auburn then dissapears.;2005-10-04 19:00:00;1 hour;Blue Star object seen hovering above auburn then dissapears. We were driving down the road as I looked out into the sky and saw a huge shining blue object.   When we arrived and got out of the car and noticed that the clouds were moving behind it and that it appeared to be moving slightly (hovering)- yet it still looked like a huge star.  After standing there for and hour we went inside.   I came back outside about 10 minutes later and the star or ufo was gone.  I saw some kind of dark plane with only white light fly by very low and fast to where the ufo was.  It cirled the location for about a minute.   Then all the planes lights went off and within seconds I saw the plane again at the altitude of a commercial plane flying east towards Georgia.;32.560896013289;-85.4787073089699
