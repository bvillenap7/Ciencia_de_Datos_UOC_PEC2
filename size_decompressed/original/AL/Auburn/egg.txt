Roughly the size of 3 moons side-by-side I have a B.S. in ((deleted)), a ((deleted--graduate/professional degree in social science)).  I am a ((deleted--40+)) year old female with a husband and ((deleted--several)) children.  I am presently ((deleted)) education and have been a ((deleted--professional)) as well. Today, 2-2-03, at 8:05 pm,I was out with my dog in our yard. I was looking at the NE sky in relation to my home.  An object appeared suddenly in the sky as if a huge but self-contained light had been switched on. It was totally illuminated like the moon without lighting the sky around it.  No halo or beams, just white moon-like light.   The object was roughly the length of 3 moons, but stretched  into a long sideways oval or egg shape.  I observed it,trying to figure out what it was, for about 3-5 seconds.  It traveled in a south to north direction rapidly but seamlessly in a smooth glide and then completely disappeared as if a light had been extinguished. There is nothing in my experience to compare this with visually.  The only other event I have witnessed was a bright illumination late at night which went from one end of the yard on with a ruler-sharp edge. The lighted section was like daylight -the dark was like night.  This event was also capured by a bank camera operating at night and was on the news the next day (which validated what I saw).  I only hope someone out there witnessed the whatever-it-was tonight and will let me know.;32.560896013289;-85.4787073089699
