I was awaken by a light shining through my window.  First thought it may be the moon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2017-05-09 03:30:00;10 minutes;I was awaken by a bright light shining through my window.  I looked up and at first thought it may be the moon.  I tried to go back to sleep but the light was so bright it was bothering me.  I got up and looked out the window and saw a very bright white light, so bright it was hard to tell the shape but the closest I would put it with would be a circle.  It was very low in the sky, it rested just above the treetops.   At first I thought maybe someone brought in soccer lights to do construction, so I laid back down with my back facing the light and tried to go back to sleep.  As I laid there resting I realized that we lived too far from the construction site to be able to see any lights.  I turned around and the light had completely disappeared.  I didn't take any pictures because at the time I would have to open that back door and I didn't want to wake anyone up.  I am not sure what I saw but this light has not sat well with me from the moment I first laid eyes on it,  It is odd.;32.560896013289;-85.4787073089699
