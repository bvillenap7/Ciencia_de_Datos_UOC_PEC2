At approximately 9:00 p.m., my husband and son were returning from being out and noticed two objects in the sky near our home when they drove in. One object was Northwest and the other was Southwest. Both were at the same distance in the sky and directly across from each other, by a considerable distance. The object northwest was brighter than any star we have ever seen. Very white and seemed to be flickering mildly. The other object southwest had green and red lights, but fainter in color. Both objects were stationary. My son told us they were probably planets, and we went in the house, not wanting to make a scene in front of the kids. We went back out about an hour later to check and see if they were still there, and they were gone.;32.560896013289;-85.4787073089699
