I know the decade - the 80s I know the day - Friday I know the time - 5:30 I know the season - winter. I know the time and day  because I was meeting my husband, a University Professor, after he left school, at the house of friends for a drink before going out for dinner. It had to be winter because it was already dark. I took back streets to avoid stop lights, had stopped at a two-way stop and, because there were no other cars in sight, was preparing to cross the intersection when  all at once  shining above me was a  bright, bright white light, not a searchlight type beam, but a hovering object with light diffused all around and about, seeming to come from within. It could not have been more than 30 feet above me and made no sound at all. I was so startled that I couldn't take note of any particulars.  It just radiated light.  I couldn't move, but after no more than a minute, the light rose straight up to a great height and sped away in a north westerly direction, very straight and purposeful, very rapid.  I followed it with my eyes and headed in the same direction in my car but it was moving much too rapidly and I couldn't of course follow a straight course. When it was just a speck of far-away light,  a shower of sparks fell from it and it was gone. When I got to the home of our friends, I told them my story and then called the police to ask if anyone had reported an unknown object in the sky.  No one had.  I can't imagine that I was the only one who saw it.  Perhaps there were those who wondered at it but didn't report it, or perhaps those seeing something streaking across the sky didn't think it unusual.  I probably would have been among any of those except that I had seen that object rise from just above me before it sped away. I had no idea what to do with such information and, too, didn't want to be among those being laughed at for  telling  outlandish stories about flying saucers.  So - I filed it away in my memory bank and thought of it seldom until I saw the Jennings program the other night.  This inexact description of events of that evening probably does not advance knowledge re UFOs at all but at least  and at last I've told it.  I am a feet-on-the-ground sort of person  never before had I experienced something of that kind, nor have I since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.
