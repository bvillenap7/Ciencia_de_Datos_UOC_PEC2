Close sighting of possible alien orbs.;2016-03-15 22:15:00;00:01;Close sighting of possible alien orbs. The sighting was of small spheres about the size of soft balls or slightly larger.  They had a very bright shinny metallic in appearance.  They were moving as a small group (3 to 4 ft. in  dia.) They came from a wooded area behind a roll of houses about 35 feet from me.  They were only about 10 feet above the house traveling at a low rate of speed as they came over the house as they flew directly toward me.  I was standing in the street.  At this time an other sphere trailing just behind the group came from on a lower flight path just clearing the house roof to join the others.  As they approached the street where I was standing they made an abrupt turn parallel to the street as if they had seen me.  They crossed the lot of the house next to the first one and flew into and through the tops a group of leafless hardwood trees on the far side lot line.  All the time, maintaining the same general group size, and without hitting any tree branches that  I could see.  This fl! ight path, to the West, took them to the wooded area from which they had come.  I quickly moved down the street for a better view of their flight path, but they had disappeared from my sight.  Also, just before this sighting I had noted a bright object  high above me with a short bright tail traveling at a high rate of speed. It made a very sharp U turn back toward it's original flight path and disappeared quickly. Could these have been alien orbs?
