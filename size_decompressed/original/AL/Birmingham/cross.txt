Strange white light in the sky with red lights that circled around it;2012-04-29 21:00:00;20  - 30 min;strange white light in the sky with red lights that circled around it I live in an apartment complex that is high up on a hill. I have an amazing view of the city from my balcony I can clearly see the airport. Often, I sit and look out while smoking a cigarette. The past few nights I have witnessed a strange light. At first, I thought it was just a star. The longer I looked at it, the more details I could see. It almost seems shaped like the symbol from the Blair Witch films (best way to describe it). It's a cross with ends pointing out in different directions. Two red lights can be seen circling around it at times. It appears in the same general location of the sky almost every night. It seems to move at a painfully slow pace.  It just hovers for a long time. I check back on it every few minutes and it has barely moved from view behind a large tree outside my apartment. The even stranger thing is that very small looking planes seems to fly right past it constantly.  These are tiny red lights that flash quickly and fly fast.  One night it seemed like two of them were harnessed together and then the one in the back just dropped from the sky and vanished. Tonight my strange star in the sky, slowly shrunk until it was almost invisible to me.  It was strange because at first I thought a cloud had passed in front of it (though I believe it may be too low in the sky for that).  But it just appeared to get more and more hazy until it was just a pin prick of what it once was. So, I have no idea what to call this thing that appears here nightly.  I'm beginning to be a bit freaked out, though.  I urged my boyfriend to look at it.  While he had no explanation for what it was, he didn't seem nearly as intrigued as me.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
