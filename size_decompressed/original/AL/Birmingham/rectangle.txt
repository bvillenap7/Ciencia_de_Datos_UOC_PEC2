Rectangle shape, like a flat non-reflective white 2-by-4, and seemed suspended in air - - no movement.;2003-07-30 19:00:00;1 minute;07-30-03 19:00 CST 15 miles South of Birmingham on I-65   I was tailing a friend on the way back to Montgomery, AL following a trip to Birmingham to help him move his belongings. Heading South on I-65 approximately 15 miles below Birmingham, I saw what I first presumed to be a short contrail at 2'o-clock [it was still daylight]. I looked again and noticed it was a perfect rectangle shape, like a flat non-reflective white 2-by-4, and seemed suspended in air - - no movement. It seemed huge. If it was a single-level passenger craft, it was designed for an average passinger height around 12 feet tall. As my friend was on his cell phone, I decided not to call him to verify, but when we returned from the trip I asked if he had noticed the bogey at 2-o-clock. Athough I have seen several different objects since childhood, it was important to verify what he thought because he is a Marine Sgt. and he has a knowledge of military - civilian craft. He noted that although he knew of an airport close by, he had noticed the object and that it was certainly not moving, nor was it a contrail. He had a rear glass window large enough to notice it still motionless a minute or so later.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
