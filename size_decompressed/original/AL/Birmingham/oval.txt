Red-Orange ovals flying across hwy 280;2012-07-04 23:23:00;7-9 minutes;Red-Orange ovals flying across hwy 280 I was outside smoking a cigarette and saw a orange-red light, moving silently and slowly from my right to left at about a 30 degree angle from my viewpoint.   A second, then third object came into view, so I ran up onto my porch and called my mom and dad to come out.  As they did a fourth flew by.  It was the first one they saw, then 3 more also flew by.   The first few objects flew in a straight line, but the last 3 were varying their direction slightly.   One moved up and down a little, the other 2 flew in an arc away from the direction of the preceding 5 objects due east.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
