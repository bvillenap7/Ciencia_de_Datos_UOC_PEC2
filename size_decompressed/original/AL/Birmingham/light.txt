Brilliant green light across the Birmingham Sky...Definitely not a plan.;2006-11-28 05:30:00;15 seconds;Brilliant green light across the Birmingham Sky...Definitely not a plan. My friend and I were stopped at a traffic light in the middle of my neighborhood...we observed the green light towards the northeast from our position moving quicker than a plane at about a 45 degree angle towards the earth.  It was moving from left to right.....we lost it in the horizon over the trees....we had never seen anything like it.  I've seen a shooting star, it was nothing of the sort.  It was a brilliant light green and was moving in a direct path.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
Bluish-Green Light over Alabama;2006-11-28 17:30:00;8-12 seconds;Bluish-Green Light over Alabama I tried submitting this report last year, but no one would take it seriously. I assure you that this is in no way a hoax.  My friend and I were leaving a detention session at a high school about 30 minutes before this happened.  I was waiting to get picked up by my parents (my friend and I were the only ones left waiting to be picked up). I was staring up into the sky, lost in thought, when a light caught my attention. It was a bluish-green light that travelled from one side of the sky to the other in about 10, maybe 12 seconds. It looked like it was surrounded by a kind of haze or aura.  As my eyes tried to focus on it, it disappeared behind a cloud bank and vanished from my sight.  The object seemed to be emitting sparks and left a trail, almost like the haze emitted by jet aircraft flying at a low level. After I saw it, I only had to wait about 3 seconds before I heard a very odd noise, which sounded like a car backfiring, with a whistling noise that followed.   am telling this event to the best of my recollection and testify that is 100% true to the letter.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
Strange light(s) in the sky over Birmingham, Alabama for  2 consecutive days;2009-01-15 18:15:00;40 minutes;Strange light(s) in the sky over Birmingham, Alabama for  2 consecutive days In the Western sky around 6:15-7:00pm central time in Birmingham,AL I was outside on my back porch when I looked up (as I always do to look at the stars), and I observed a light in the sky that at first I thought was a star. The thing that caught my eye was the fact that it was a bit larger than a star and a lot brighter. I've seen this in the sky for the last few weeks, and I simply thought it was Jupiter or Venus or some other planet that I thought I had heard someone on TV talking about being in the night sky at this time in the year. Well, on this night and on the next, the star moved. I don't mean it moved a tiny bit, it really moved! If you hold your hand out at arm's length to measure the distance that it moved, it moved about 3-4 inches in any given direction. Sometimes it would perform a circle type movement, but most of the time it would just kind of float around, going from one side to the other, back and forth. I observed this for 40 minutes or so, until I could no longer see it (it seemed to sink in the sky as time went on). It would seem to be moving in a straight line at times, almost like it was deciding on a direction to take, and would travel in this straight line for a couple of inches (at arm's length) and then it would stop, only to move around aimlessly, without purpose again for a while. I'm not sure how many points of light there were coming from the object, but at times it seemed to have more than one, maybe three or more. Maybe it was disk shaped, because at times it would dim as though the lights were turning away from my direction. There were no flashing lights of any color, only whitish light. I hope to see it again the next few nights to take a picture or video of it.(I have no camera, but my girlfriend does);33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
Unknown object over Birmingham metro flashing rapidly, changing directions for over an hour. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star?  PD));2012-09-20 20:07:00;over an hour;Unknown object over birmingham metro flashing rapidly, changing directions for over an hour. Began around 20:07 light was rapidly changing color from red to white to blue to green. Started high in the sky, slowly moving in several different directions.  Continued to descend very slowly and diagonally - every once in a white stopping in place and flashing lights in a pattern and then returning to rapid flashing and moving once more.  What caught our eyes was the fact that it started moving horizontally to the left ( opposite of what it was originally doing) and back to the right.   Repeated this pattern for about an hour until it began to fizzle out (possibly from heading into the far distance).

Blue and red light, other object(s);2012-10-17 03:20:00;15 minutes;blue and red light, other object(s) I came outside for a smoke with my brother and noticed that it was not cloudy anymore. It was actually quite clear. All of the stars were very bright. My brother pointed out a red and blue &quotstar&quot facing northwest.  I noticed it not only changed from red to blue, but that it also was illuminating something above it.  It was silent.  It took about 15 minutes to disappear. I verified it was not any known object I.e. star, planet with Google Sky Map.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
Bright light object floating in night sky, disappears when another craft comes up.;2013-04-26 20:20:00;~5 minutes;Bright light object floating in night sky, disappears when another craft comes up Walked outside to my car, took a moment to look at the stars when I saw a bright round light floating in the sky, passing between other stars.  There was no navigation lights or any other type of flashing light attached to this object.  There is an airport very close to here, so I know my fair share of what aircraft fly over this area and what they look like at night.  The strangest part of all of this is a small drone like craft with blinking navigation lights was coming up behind the object, when it seemed to simply disappear.  This is not my first sighting of these objects in this area.  Have witnessed close to 5 within the past 9 months.

20-30 bright orange spheres flying in two's or three's, travelling from southwest to northeast without sound;2014-03-16 20:10:00;8-10 minutes;20-30 bright orange spheres flying in two's or three's, travelling from southwest to northeast without sound Birmingham Alabama, 8:10 to 8:18 pm.  Many orange spheres (20-30) flying in pairs or in threes travelling very fast from south west  to north east.  No sound. Three of us were standing in the front yard, and saw some orange/red lights coming up from the south west to the north east.  There were no sounds coming from any.   They were moving quite quickly.  They tended to be in groups of 2 or 3.  No flashing lights as would be on an aircraft.  The light was very bright.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059

(UFO) over I-20 bright light.;2015-06-14 18:00:00;5 minutes;(UFO) over I-20 bright light. My wife and I were heading west on I-20, when we noticed a bright light out of the driverâ€™s side window (South).  The object was extremely bright even at the distance of about 5 miles from our location.   The light just popped up and while my wife was still looking at it, it vanished.  Not behind a cloud, it did not take off or fade into the distance, it just vanished.   As a computer engineer, and her as a data analyst, we both used the process of elimination and there is nothing that can account for the object.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
Object that is the size of a small star changed size, light intensity, and rapidly dropped to the ground after 40 seconds of observatio;2017-12-14 03:47:00;1 minute;Object that is the size of a small star changed size, light intensity, and rapidly dropped to the ground after 40 seconds of observatio My Sighting:  	At approximately 3:47, I observed a light in the sky, too small to be a plane even at its biggest shape.  The object was moving in an alarmingly strange fashion, which is what initially caused me to observe it.  I will state my location, which is Birmingham, Alabama, traveling northward at the time on Highway 280, but waiting in the turn lane to turn on I-459 South.  I noticed the light intensity on this object was changing in an unpredictable way, much like the movements.  While the movements and shapes of this small star shaped light were sporadic, it did move in a general direction of east to west. About 40 seconds after observing said object,  I noticed it got harder to follow.  When it became visible again, it dropped to the ground at an extremely fast speed.  I should also mention that it was daytime and my visibility was clear.  I spoke to the hotline manager at 3:55 to report my sighting.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
High flying slow moving object that seemed to be floating then was destroyed and disappeared;2020-07-26 19:45:00;20-30 minutes;High flying slow moving object that seemed to be floating then was destroyed and disappeared In southwest sky I noticed what appeared to be a bright star in the pre-dusk sky.  I spotted it while I was looking at the moon.  With the moon as a reference point, and the nearby treetops, I noticed that the object was actually slowly moving at high altitude generally in a Westerly direction but not in a perfectly straight path.  Movement was smooth and slow.  I assumed it was some type of weather balloon.  The sun was glinting off of it but at that great of a distance I couldnâ€™t tell a shape.  There was no contrail.  I kept checking on it every few minutes and I filmed it for a few uneventful minutes on my phone.  Finally I grabbed my binoculars to try to get a better look.  When I finally got focus on the object it it expelled a small smoke plume that looked like what I can best describe as what an eject seat looks like when itâ€™s fired.  Like a small rocket shot upward from it for what appeared to be a short distance.  The object immediately dimmed and disappeared and I believe I saw a small dark speck fall rapidly back to earth in my binoculars but I canâ€™t say for certain because it was so far away.  I continued to watch but there was nothing.  No chute, no more smoke, nothing.  My best guess is a weather balloon with some kind of self-distruct mechanism where it blows its balloon top?  Either that or a high flying balloon that somehow launched a small rocket into the upper atmosphere.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
Bright light moving sporadically up and down and across the sky;2020-12-01 17:50:00;10 seconds;Bright light moving sporadically up and down and across the sky Just south of Birmingham Airport. A bright light was noticed by an airline pilot and reported. The light was moving around up and down really fast. The light was very bright and more maneuverable than any drone or aircraft Iâ€™ve ever seen. The light just suddenly disappeared and the pilots confirmed that there was definitely something flying around out there within the Birmingham Airport airspace.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
