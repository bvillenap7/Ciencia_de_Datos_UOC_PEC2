Metallic object rolling across morning sky;2012-11-13 05:37:00;2-3 minutes;metallic object rolling across morning sky Walking to my car this morning, I looked up into the sky and looked at a pair of stars for a moment.   All of the sudden a spherical/oval - metallic object (almost looked like it had a line down the middle) was moving past the first star, almost as if it was &quotrolling&quot.  Object continued moving past second star and over my head.  All I could do was stand there with my jaw dropped.  Checked satellite trackers and the only one that came through the area thirty five minutes prior - lasting for a duration of 5 minutes.

Red glowing object in the sky.;2014-05-22 00:00:00;3 minutes;Red glowing object in the sky. Driving back from the store and then we see a small red glow like it wasn't a light it emitted its on glow we thought it was one of those balloons with the candles but as we looked closer we saw it was in a weird egg shaped disc with a slightly pointed nose and we stopped the car and looked out the windows and it stopped over some houses about 300 feet away in the distance.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
