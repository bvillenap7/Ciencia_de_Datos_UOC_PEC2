I'm placing this report because it was the first ufo i have ever seen and it was quite interesting. I have not seen any more ufo's since but it was my first experience and it was unbelievable. Me and my mother and aunt were standing outside having a conversation. For some reason I looked up into the sky on our back porch. Looking up with the side of the gutters on our house as a frame in my vision, I saw a silver grayish round object suspended in the sky not moving at all. I pointed it out to my mother and aunt they both said they had no idea what it was. Then i went in the house to get some binoculars. I came back out to the porch and when I looked up to where the the object was before but it had vanished. I was mad. Because this was my first ufo and it didn't last very long. But i'll always remember. And I believe. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059

((HOAX??))  metallic sphere tailing fighter jet;2006-10-20 11:30:00;2 minutes;metallic sphere tailing fighter jet i regularly go out on my roof to look for ufos as i am an enthusiast. me and my sister were up on my roof i think around the 20th but it was a while ago. like any other home, we're subject to the occasional flyover by military aircraft. as what looked like an f-14 flew overhead, i noticed a small metallic object keeping pace with it. the pilot of the f-14 either didn't see it or was escorting? it. it wasn't a missile, as it left no smoke trail. it wasn't a drone, as it was way too small. and i dont know of any aircraft that will drop fuel drop tanks on a populated area. it freaked me out really bad ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

The t;2006-11-28 17:30:00;45 sec.;I noticed a light streaking across the sky and thought it was a large meteorite, but it was too slow and was unmistakably green.  The trail was much thicker that a meteorite so it seemed to be close to the ground.  It was in full view until it went over a Mt. and out of my line of sight.  It never stopped or chaged direction.

Luminated orb.;2012-12-03 05:25:00;2-3 minutes;Luminated orb Walking outside to my car for work, saw an orb like object floating quickly across the sky moving south/ south east.  At first I thought the object was a star due to its intense brightness until I realized it was in motion.  It wasn't flying low, but it wasn't outside of our atmosphere either. Could still see its lumination as it went behind a small patch of cloud cover.   Ran inside to grab my boyfriend and he was amazed as well.  It looked incredibly similar to footage from Eceti ranch of their UFO phenomenon.   This is the third out of fourth sighting I've had in the past month.  There was no sound, and it resembled craft I have seen in the area, although the others were no laminated in this manner.   Fourth sighting was this morning 12/06 at 545am, driving I noticed a metallic object moving quickly across the sky, slightly luminated (not very intense)   In Hoover Alabama on hwy 150.  Object had no lights, no signal lighting or navigation lighting of any kind.   I am very excited to see what's to come in the future with this many sightings thus far.
