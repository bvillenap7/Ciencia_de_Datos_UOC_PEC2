I Thought ;2000-04-22 22:00:00;30 min;A bright objeck was seen in the Southwestern sky, about 22:00 hrs. I had just gone onto my back porch when I saw the object. I Thought at first it was a plane coming in for landing, as it was flashing blue and red, white lights. It never moved, however. I am a retired RN, and my son, who also saw the object, is a Respiratory Therapist. He was getting ready to go to work, and usually leaves 22:30 hrs. I called him out to see the object, and he became very excited when he saw it was pulsating lights, but not moving. We went outside with binoculars, but the binoculars did not help, only confirmed it was not moving.It appeared to be very high up, at the level a commercial airplane flies. I called my sister, who lives about 1/4 miles from me. She verified the same sight. She is a teachers assistant at a local school. None of us has ever seen a UFO, and we were trying to be objective, like it might be a star, or whatever, but it was too bright and pulsating to be a star, and it wasn't moving. Has anyone else reported seeing this object?;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
Heard low rumbling sound, saw a big ?? In the sky before it disappeared.;2017-01-09 03:02:00;5 minutes;Heard low rumbling sound, saw a big ?? In the sky before it disappeared. I was asleep in bed with my girlfriend, having a random simple normal dream about a supermarket, when the dream abruptly switched to an empty white room where men in blue hoods were rushing toward me, I awoke with a gasp for air and a balled fist.  I then noticed a low rumble sound coming from outside.  I opened the window to see a large black and purple amoeba-like object in the sky. It looked as if it were made of gel or some type of thick liquid.  It stayed for about five minutes before completely fading away and the sound shortly followed. It didn't fly away, it's like it simply became invisible. Tried to take a picture but my battery died as soon as I opened my phone. I feel like I should also note that our cat was running around the room which is not normal for him at all. I am a 25 year old male, and I've never seen anything like this before.  It has been over two and a half years since my last experiment with psychedelic drugs.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
