bright white-greenish object appears, hovers in place, quickly travels zig zag pattern and vanishes;2006-11-15 01:00:00;10-15 Seconds;bright white-greenish object appears, hovers in place, quickly travels zig zag pattern and vanishes Birmingham, Alabama (Cahaba Heights area)  I have not reported this incident to anyone other than some family members and a few close friends.  It was either October or November 2006.  I was sitting out on my back porch around 1:00 A.M., clear sky.  Out of nowhere a bright white-greenish colored object appeared from my right, traveling East to West.  Cannot be sure as to distance, but it was closer than airplanes travel.  It came from East to West, moving too “quick” to be an airplane or shooting star then came to sudden stop and hovered in place for about 5-10 seconds as its illumination increased to a brighter green (pulsating to a brighter degree illumination) .  The illumination reduced to the level it was when I first observed it, at which time it traveled very quickly to the right, back to the left, then back to the right in an upward direction – then just disappeared into thin air.  I would describe the way this object “exited” as an extremely quick zigzag motion or Z pattern.  I have never seen anything even close to this before.  I used to be skeptical when I would hear people report things like this – but I know what I saw.  I wanted to report what I saw that very night, but did not know exactly who or where to report this.  I learned about this sight earlier today.  Hopefully, there are others who saw this unmistakable and unforgettable event which occurred in either October or November 2006.

A large green glowing round object was seen flying above  the Birmingham, Alabama  area  at 5:30 pm on November  28, 2006.;2006-11-28 17:30:00;30 seconds;A large green glowing round object was seen flying above  the Birmingham, Alabama  area  at 5:30 pm on November  28, 2006. Around 5:30 pm November 28 a neighbor and I saw a ball of fire streaking thru the sky.  It came from the west and was heading eastward.  It was not very high in the sky, maybe a mile up, and it was much larger than a plane.  It was round, light green in color and surrounded with a glowing white light.  It had a tail similar to that of a comet.  It traveled at a very slow speed and it never burned out (we thought it might be a shooting star).  It kept flying eastward.  We watched it about 30 seconds until it flew over the tree line.  Later that night I heard on the news that it was a meteor but the next day the local news called it a UFO becuase they were not sure what it was.  The news said NASA had no signs of meteors in our area when this object was spotted.  The news said that many people saw it in our area.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
Bright orange fireball seen for a about a full minute.;2013-07-05 20:36:00;1:00;Bright orange fireball seen for a about a full minute. Stuck my head out of the window to smoke a cigarette when I saw a slow moving bright orange light.   It looked like something would as if were falling through the atmosphere with a tail.   It appeared to be going one direction.   The light slowly dimmed as it went into the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting occurred at night, and have changed the time to reflect that fact.  PD));33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059

UFOs moving fast like fireballs or individual rockets.;2014-12-11 16:40:00;20 minutes;UFOs moving fast like fireballs or individual rockets. We were leaving Centerpoint, Alabama.  When we got past the airport, we sighted 6 of what looked to be white dots from our car.  Then, as we got closer to downtown, we got a better view.  The objects look like fire balls, or meteors, flying through the sky.  I recorded one of them moving toward Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  All the others moving fast and out of sight fast, moving in no specific sequence, but at one point, in a T-formation, then a V-formation, then breaking off in a scatter, but a close scatter.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
