Large dark chevron, silently passing overhead in early AM hours, only seen because against star fields.;2004-02-01 02:00:00;15 sec;Large dark chevron, silently passing overhead in early AM hours, only seen because against star fields. Date of sighting is approximate.  It was either in 2003 or 2004, on a cold, fall/winter night.   The sky was especially clear (e.g., low humidity/haze) with a lot more stars visible to the naked eye than is usually the case.   I live in Vestavia Hills, directly south from Birmingham.  I had gotten up to take our dog outside to go to the bathroom.  It was after midnight, and likely around 2AM or 3AM.  I was looking up at the stars when something obstructed my view.  At first I thought it was just a cloud, but as this thing moved across a star field, I could clearly see that its leading edge was triangular or chevron shaped.  I could not make out the shape of the rear of the object.  Also, I did not hear any noise.   At the time, I figured it must be a B-1 bomber and was listening for the sound of engines but heard none, or none that could be heard over a background of light, late-night traffic noise.   The object appeared to be large (3 or 4 moon diameters across), and at a relative low altitude for aircraft, and traveled across a quarter of the sky in about 10 to 15 seconds.  Its speed appeared to be the same as a commercial jet at low altitude on a landing approach.  It was traveling in an approximate S to SSW direction.   At the time i figured the B-1 must be heading to Maxwell Airforce Base in Montgomery, Alabama (or Eglin Air Force Base on the Gulf Coast).

southwestern skies of Birmingham, black object dart and zig zag then flee without trace;2007-07-22 06:30:00;5 seconds;southwestern skies of Birmingham, black object dart and zig zag then flee without trace I woke up early Sunday morning and went outside to have a cigarette.  After sitting down and looking up, I noticed how clear the sky and how thinly transparent the clouds were.  Right before sunrise.  I noticed a black object in the in the clouds.. thinking it was a big black bird, I watched it.  Then it made sharp movements and seemed to zig-zag then shot like a bullet and left no trace.  I searched the skies for several minutes to see if it was traveling thru patches in the clouds but it was gone.  I had a very clear open view of the sky. Birds and planes are easy to follow at the height that I saw this object, but this just vanished in a flash!;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
