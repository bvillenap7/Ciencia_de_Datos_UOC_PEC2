Weird thing over high school;2008-04-03 07:15:00;5-6 minutes;Weird thing over high school First of all, i wish to assure NUFORC that this report is in no way a hoax. Some of my past reports have been labeled as such (ex. metallic sphere tailing fighter jet((HOAX)). I assure everyone that reads this report to be 100% truth.  I am a student at (name withheld) high school in Alabama. On the morning of April 3, 2008, at 7:15 a.m., I was leaning on my car in the parking lot of (name withheld) high school, waiting for the first bell to ring. I got bored and looked up. First I saw a puff of smoke or steam appear in the sky. I then saw a small, fast aircraft appear out of it. After it traveled for a short distance at a great speed, I saw another puff of smoke or steam appear. It came out of the cloud, and then sped up so fast my eyes had trouble keeping up. I t ust not have been made of metal, because it did not glint in the rising sun. Are there any other kinds of aircraft that don't use metal in their full construction? At this point, I coyuld discern the shape, which was a cigar. A cloud was ditrectly in the way that the object was travelling. What happened next didn't make anyy sense to me at all. I looked at the cloud, and part of the cloud just disappeared. Completely cut in half. I know this sounds pretty wierd, but the flight path of the shape where it would intersect with the cloud had completely disappeared. The shape went through the small hole.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
