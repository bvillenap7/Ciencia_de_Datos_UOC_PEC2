Two pinpoints of light over DoubleOak Mtn.;2007-07-25 21:27:00;5-7 minutes;Two pinpoints of light over DoubleOak Mtn. My friends and I were on our way back to our band practice house when I saw these two small, distant points of light travelling over the top of double- oak mountain. I decided not to tell my friends, as they are not inclined to believe. I kept my eyes on it as we moved towards Chelsea. It seemed to rise and fall thousands of feet with relative ease(I used clouds as a background marker to help determine altitude). I do not think it was an airplane. Airplanes normally have flashing lights turned on at night. This one was either not an airplane, or the pilot received a very nasty letter from the FAA the next week. It eventually faded from view. There were also 2 other planes in the area. It is unknown to me whether they were chasing it or if they were just there.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059

I went off 20 yards by my self to use the restroom and smoke a cigarette since my friends didnt like smoke.  When I looked up into the sky I saw a an oval shape beam of light that was surounded by a glowing beam of red.  It seemed as if it was getting closer but every time I moved closer it disappared.  No one has believed me;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059

I heard a low humming sound.;2017-01-09 03:12:00;3-4 minutes;I heard a low humming sound. About 3 am, I was up watching tv, when I felt a low humming in the air.  It had a wide range of volume so I knew it couldn't be in the house because of the brick structure I was in.  I walked outside as the humming got stronger, looked up and saw nothing but complete darkness which was normal but the humming was right above me and moving.   Then about thirty seconds later, I noticed the black sky I thought I was seeing was moving cause now I can see the back of it moving away making view of the real night sky with stars and night light.  The black object slowly moved on over my back yard which is three acres but the object was at least one mile long and one mile wide cause of the duration of time it took to become noticed by sound and the time it took to disappear.  It was about a quarter mile above my trees.  The sound was a air humming sound with no detonation.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059

(about the speed of a vehicles hazard lights blinking.)  Looked as though the two lights were each in the middle of their own rectangle (picture flashing lights in the middle of solar panels on an typical satellite...this was the same sort of shape) and a pin-prick very dim greenish-blue light was also visible between the two flashing lights.  This was definitely not an average plane, but my impression is that it was still human-made.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
14 objects with bright red/orange lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Husban is former FBI Special Agent.  PD));2019-02-18 21:15:00;30 minutes;14 objects with bright red/orange lights The following event occurred between 9:15PM and 9:45PM on 2/18/19 at Birmingham, AL: To set the stage for what my wife and I observed, I need  to mention that our bedroom has a large bay area with seven windows which have plantation type shutters, covering the lower half of the windows, leaving  the upper portions open to the sky.  We can lie in bed and look out at the stars or passing aircraft in the sky.  On this particular night, the sky was clear. During the above time  frame, I was watching TV when my wife remarked, “What in the world is that? I looked out of one of the windows to observe something moving in the sky from a northwestern direction toward the southeast.  What we were looking at was something with a very bright red light on top of an orange light.  We at first thought it was a helicopter but I have never seen a helicopter with that type lighting.  My wife then said, “Look, there is another one.”  I remarked that there must be a bad wreck, and they are sending two helicopters.  (It is noted that we live near a hospital, and it is not unusual for us to see and hear helicopters at night).  We the saw a third object  and then a fourth fifth and sixth.  All of these objects looked alike with the same red and orange lights.  All six of  these objects were visible at one time. My wife jumped out of bed and went to the other end of our house to see where these objects were going.  They kept coming about fifteen seconds apart.  We observed a total of fourteen of these object, all with the same lights. All of these objects followed the same path and seemed to be traveling at  about  the speed of a helicopter. Some of them seemed to be at an altitude of about 2,000 feet and some at about 1000 feet although this is only a guess.  As they passed not far from our house, they seemed to climb to the southeast and then disappear. The fact that we never heard any sound from these objects caused us to think they might be  drones but why would there be fourteen of them all going the same route?  We were never able to see any frame as all we could focus on were the bright red and orange lights. There is nothing of interest known to us that would be on the course that these objects took. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the husband, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent and serious-minded.  We suspect that both he and his wife are unusually reliable witnesses.
