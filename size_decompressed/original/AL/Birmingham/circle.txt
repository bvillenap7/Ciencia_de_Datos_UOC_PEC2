Saw what appeared to be neither space debris but a round object  that was quite shiny, however, the object did not disintergrate nor did it travel in a straight line, in my personal observation, it may have possibly attempted an reverse orbit i.e. it may have tried to get back out of the earths' orbit, I know about aviation and space travel, I have studied aviation in the past, in my opinion this was NOT a SHOOTING STAR as most would want to be swayed into thinking about, but rather would be of an origin from another space-time continueum, cannot exactly prove what this object was but was very impressed with the way it handled it-self when it retrograded back into the stratospherical altittude, possibly, and dissappeared. I wish you at NUFORC the best in your endeavors....Mr.A;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059

My mother and I were driving down Old Springville Road, Clay AL, when we saw a single greenish-blue ball of light in the sky.  At first it was going along side of us (we were going north) and then a few seconds later it disapeared behind trees.  There was a short delay, and then it looked like it was falling diagnally in front of us.  Then it was gone.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
Red circular object travelling at high rate of speed;2011-12-31 21:00:00;10-15 seconds;red circular object travelling at high rate of speed This sighting occurred in Birmingham AL approximately 9:00 PM Saturday night, December 31, 2011. I was on my back deck when I saw a small red glowing circular object about twice the size of the northern star at approximately 45 degrees above the Eastern horizon, moving south to north at a high rate of speed. The airport is approximately 10 airline miles north of my house so I see airplanes crossing the sky all the time and I would estimate this object traveled at least two to three times the rate of a normal passenger jet. Being New Yearâ€™s Eve I dismissed it as fireworks but it traveled on a flat trajectory across the sky at what had to be an extreme altitude. It took about ten seconds to cross my field of vision before it blinked out and disappeared.;33.4885993097499;-86.7782773943059
