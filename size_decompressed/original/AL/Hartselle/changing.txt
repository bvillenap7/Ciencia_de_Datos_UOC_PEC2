Changing lights in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-14 23:00:00;20 minutes;Changing lights in the sky Last night I woke up around 11 pm. I got up to get some water and noticed there was a triangle shaped object in the sky above the tree line to the south of my house.  There were lights on the object, one on each point, and I initially thought it might have been a plane but after standing there for several minutes, I realized the object was not moving.   I woke up my friend who was staying the night and by the time we got back to the window, the lights had started pulsing.   As we watched, the object seemed to change shape and two more lights appeared on the object.  It looked as if there were two poles suddenly coming out each side of the now spherical object and they were radiating almost a rainbowish light.  After a few minutes of watching this, we both became unbearably groggy and sleepy.  In all honesty, I don’t remember going back to bed and neither does my friend. This morning when I was leaving for work, my neighbor remarked that we “had lights again”.  I reported on 12/29/16 that both the neighbor and I had seen two triangle shaped objects above the tree line to the south.  We frequently see things in the sky that seem odd but generally we don’t see them at the same time.  Since this was another case where we both saw the same thing occur, I decided to report it.
