6 Bright lights over Hartselle Alabama;2019-12-19 17:39:00;5min;6 Bright lights over Hartselle Alabama My 29 year old son was traveling Interstate 65 south from Decatur Al going home from work. Approaching the Hartselle exit he noticed these lights in the sky around 5:39pm  and stopped to photograph them. Multiple cars were also stopped taking photos. The lights in the image seem to be oblong but he said that was his camera as the lights were a solid circle. They hung around about 5 minutes then disappeared. I don’t know what they would want in Hartselle but Redstone Arsenal is in Huntsville,Al, about 25-30 minutes away by car. I’m assuming a few seconds in ufo speed.;34.4469;-86.9237
