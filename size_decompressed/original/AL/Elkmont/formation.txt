5 bright lights in pentagon formation AL/TN line.;2013-07-07 20:30:00;2 minutes;5 bright lights in pentagon formation AL/TN line 5 bright star like objects in pentagon formation over horizon looking northwest from Elkmont, AL.   Formation stayed solid as objects moved east/northeast, eventually going behind large cloud cover.   Lights would have normally just appeared as a distant aircraft...  But 5 lights in a definitive formation struck me as strange.  A sixth light of similar size and brightness was trailing quite a ways back and at a much lower elevation.
