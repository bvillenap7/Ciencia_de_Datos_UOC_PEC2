Two bright orange fireballs moving from north to south at a high rate of speed.;2015-07-03 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;two bright orange fireballs moving from north to south at a high rate of speed. I was sitting on my back patio, just like I do almost every evening, when i seen two fireballs come flying over top of my house.  one of the fire balls was in front of the other one, they were both very bright orange and moving at a high rate of speed.  they appeared to have a halo kind of glow around them, they were traveling from the south to the north.  i just read the other report and they said they saw it about 1:30 am near Huntsville, Alabama?  that is really weird because the 2 fireballs i seen were headed toward north alabama, but it wouldnt have taken the fireballs 4 and a half hous to get there at the rate of speed they were moving?i seen the two objects between 8:30 and 9:00 pm.  the two fireballs i seen just kind of faded into the sky or simply disapeared.when i first seen the ufos i yelled over to my next door neighbor who happened to be sitting on his back patio,he ran over to my back yard and i told him to look up as i pointed towards the fireballs,he stood t! here with his mouth wide open as him and i were gazing apon the two object.  WHAT ((deleted)) WAS THAT?  IT WAS BEAUTIFULL I MUST SAY.  i did manage to take a photo but the quality of the picture is very poor.;30.3961;-87.5918
