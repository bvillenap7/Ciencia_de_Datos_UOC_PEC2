He primary witness gazed up into the relatively dark sky when 2 lights were seen moving in on patterns before splitting off and going into different directions were they still maintained strange elliptical patterns.  First they would move forward then randomly left to right then circle back then forward again with what seemed to be no rhyme or reason at speeds that would have been very difficult for conventional aircraft. T2 lights seem to be as far away has the Stars as this was not a low orbit event. This is the first incident this witness has reported at this location.;30.3961;-87.5918
