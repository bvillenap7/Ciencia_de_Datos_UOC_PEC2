I only looked up in the sky because I had seen three of these on the 3rd of this month, a few nights ago, all traveling northbound and also dissapearing in the same manner.  I know the difference between what I'm seeing out here, and a shooting star or meteor.  These lights are clearly objects that are very far away and moving more slowly then shooting stars and they are barely perceptable, where a shooting star is very bright.  the objects move quickly though for the distance that they appear up in space.An aircraft that is only a few miles up from earth travels fast across the sky but airplanes that are higher up would not move as fast as the unidentified objects I have observed.  There is a military base in Pensacola of course but airplanes have flashing lights and this light does not blink.  Also, these objects appear to be much higher up in the sky then any aircraft I've seen.
