I am 55 years old and I don't make up stories. I was in the back yard on a clear dark night. With my love of astronomy, I always watch the the heavens. I saw what I thought was a US space probe with reflected sunlight. They are easily seen as I used to see many in the late 50's and early 60's during the early space race. This light was moving on a straight projectory from due east to west at an extremely high altitude. Then it turned north and made a complete 360 degree turn  and did this two times. Then a second one appeared on the same projectory and it did the same 360 degree turn once that I could see. These were very tight 360 degree turns. During the second sighting, I called my brother that lives about 6 miles from me and told him that I just saw a UFO. He went out on his back porch as I explained what I was seeing with directions, etc. By the time he got outside, he was not able to see what I had seen. However, a third one appeared on the same projectory which he did see as we remained in contact via cell phone. This one did not make a 360 degree turn as we could see. They had no blinking lights. As far as a sound or noise, I cannot say as the pool pump was running at the time.;33.3490160000002;-86.988965818181
