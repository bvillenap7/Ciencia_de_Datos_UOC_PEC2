I was babysitting for a lady I babysat for regularly.  She lived just out of town off  at that time very rural road called Old Tuscaloosa Hyw.near Bessemer Alabama.  She returned from a date around 1 am and I left her house soon after that for the aprox 45 min drive home. As was our usual arrangement I promised to call her when I got home to let her know I had made it safely and she could go to bed.  There were very few houses on that stretch of road until it reached the Bessemer city limits and few streetlights.  I can only guess the time as my car had no clock and I did not wear a watch, but I would guess it was between 1:15 and 1:30 am considering the time I had been gone from her house. I had my window down so I could smoke a cigarette without stinking up my car.  I heard nothing but the sound of my own engine, and soft music from the radio.  I saw a light, like a single headlight coming up behind me in my rearview. It looked like it was about a mile or more behind me.  I glanced down for just a second, looked back in my mirror and was surprised to see the light was almost caught up to me and was coming fast. I heard nothing but the sound of my own engine and was startled because I assumed it was a car or motorbike and I heard no noise.  As it rapidly came up on me I thought I was going to be rear ended, so I turned on to the shoulder of the road and braked hard. The next thing I know, I seemed to awake, though I do not remember passing out.  My car was switched off with the keys in the ignition.  It seemed like only minutes since I stopped.  There were no lights around and it was still dark. After a few moments I pulled back on the road and continued home.  As I got into the city of Bessemer, I was surprised to see more cars out and about than there usually were at 1:30 in the morning.  I arrived home and went in.  I picked up the phone and called the lady as I had promised.  She answered on the first ring and when I said I was home she scolded me for not calling sooner.  She said she had been calling me for more than an hour and was just fixing to come looking for me.  At that moment for the first time I looked at the clock. It said 4:20 am. A drive that should have taken less than an hour took me almost 3. I still donâ€™t know what happened that night.  But for a long time after that I had trouble sleeping and panic attacks.  I heard you on Coast to Coast saying how important it was to document strange things, so I decided to write you. Thank you,;33.3490160000002;-86.988965818181
