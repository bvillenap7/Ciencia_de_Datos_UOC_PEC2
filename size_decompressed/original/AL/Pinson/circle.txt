Redish orange , traveling slowly and quietly!;1986-10-15 14:00:00;Abt. 10 Seconds;Redish orange , traveling slowly and quietly! When I saw the object, I was looking upward toward some high pine trees that had become infested with pine beatles. I saw a redish orange round object, approximately 50' in diameter,  about 400 to 500 feet just above and to the north, of where I was standing. This object was traveling from SW to NE, at a rate of about 10 mph and not making a sound of any type. Immedately, I ran into our home, called the Birmingham Airport, identified myself, my location, what I had seen and the direction and speed, the object was traveling. I asked them if there was anything showing on radar, at my location. No was their answer. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.7275;-86.6466999999999
