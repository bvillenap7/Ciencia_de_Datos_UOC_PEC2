white then turned green fire ball falling from sky;2006-11-28 17:25:00;around 2 mins;white then turned green fire ball falling from sky I am sure all the cars around me saw it. I was driving on hwy 79 about a mile from Sweeny Hollow rd. At first I thought well I see a shooting star, but no it was bigger and closer to the ground than a shooting star would be probably 1/4 a mile or 1/2 a mile up, and it was falling and about halfway across my vision it turned from white to pale green. and then it dissapeared in the treeline, I am sure it landed around two miles from me around where sweeny hollow road starts again after it crosses hwy 75 and goes to Trussville.;33.7275;-86.6466999999999
