Strange lights seen over Fairhope, Alabama.;2014-05-25 22:30:00;15-20 minutes;Strange lights seen over Fairhope Alabama Last night around 10:30 a group of 9 people witnessed strange lights moving across the sky. There was a large mass traveling north to south (according to the compass on my phone).  As the lights moved across the sky, one of them would drop every few seconds.  The large mass moved towards another group of lights that seemed stationary.  The lights the mass moved towards were grouped in kind of a line, but all through this time a few of the lights left the formation and dropped down.   After all the lights grouped together, they moved together east to west (again, a guess according to my phone), all along dropping a few along the way.  We watched until they went out of sight. We all agree it was strange that the lights stayed still and came together, then changed direction and moved off together.   I tried to film it with my phone, but the video just looks black.  We were able to get a few pictures though and I will send those in an email as instructed below. We all took pictures and tried to record it, maybe the equipment you guys have can see it from the film, but I cannot. I thought it was the meteor shower or something, but now Iâ€™m not certain.;30.5012;-87.8795
