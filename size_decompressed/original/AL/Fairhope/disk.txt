2 different objects on the same day at 2 different times.;2013-08-15 17:30:00;10 seconds;2 different objects on the same day at 2 different times This is not the exact time or the date. It was around this time and date though.  My friend and I were hanging out on our street.  There were 6 other people there too who did not witness the event.  My friend and I decided to leave the group of people and hide behind a flower bed to see what the groups would do.  It was a fairly clear day, no wind and about 60 degrees outside. The group came looking for us and I was looking south while they were coming up the street facing north.  I watching them looking for us and  over the tree line I noticed a metallic/gray rounded/cigar shapped object.  It was moving up and down as it was flying from the east to the west.  It would drop about a 250 feet then a few seconds later go straight up to its intial attitude. It did this multiple times until it vanished about 10 seconds later. Later that same night about 19:00 my friend(the same one from earlier) and I were playing basketball as my friend was shooting he witnessed a blue light go across the sky. It was moving  about a moderate speed and was only one blue light there were no blinking lights which made me know its not a plane and no tell so it was not a comet, shooting star, etc... He pointed it to me while he was in shock We witnessed it about 5 seconds.  After these two events I came home and did not tell anyone due to the fear of people think I am crazy etcâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));30.5012;-87.8795
