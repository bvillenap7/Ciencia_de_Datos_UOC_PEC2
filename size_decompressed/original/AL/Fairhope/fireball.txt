Fireball moving across the sky for a good 2 minutes.;2015-07-16 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;Fireball moving across the sky for a good 2 minutes. It came up from the south bout 10pm or looking in south direction and seemed to travel north east my two bubbies said it was a jet on fire or something I keep saying it was way too high to be a jet.   i first spotted it coming up from some trees across the road were we were standing in the middle of town it seemed to go straight up and then traveled north east till it disappeared.   It lasted bout 1 to 2 min no way it as a meteor nothing could of held a trajectory like that and stay light up like it was just skipping across our atmosphere.  It had to be a spacecraft or some kind of sub orbital experimental aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a city of Gairhope, AL.
