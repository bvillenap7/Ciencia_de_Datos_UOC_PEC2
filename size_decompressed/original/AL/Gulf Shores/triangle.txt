Triangular craft hovers over State Park pier;1997-06-27 21:00:00;15 seconds;Triangular craft hovers over State Park pier There was a triangular shaped craft hovering noiselessly over the State Park Pier. I and a friend were sitting in the sand about 50 yards away from the pier.  The craft was about the size of a small building it had red, green, and white lights on the bottom and sides of the craft. It hovered over the pier for about 15 seconds then suddenly it sped away to the West. The craft never made a noise, but it could move at very high speeds.;30.2732;-87.7605999999999

I dont know what the object is besides the shape in the report.  ((e-address deleted));2013-03-17 11:44:00;5 minutes;I dont know what the object is besides the shape in the report. ((e-address deleted)) Dear who this may concern,   The triangular shaped object was seen by me around  11:45 and was witnessed by several other people who I personally do not know.  The reason that I was outside because there where college students yelling and screaming outside so I assumed that they were intoxicated because of spring break.  When I walked out on to the balcony I saw the young students pointing up in the sky and yelling.  When I figured out what the people where pointing at as was terrified it was an object possibly about the size of a yacht or semi-truck in the shape of a triangle with red light on the side and a blue on the following side and at center point was green.  Then the large white light at the center of the craft beamed at light of some kind of light at a nearby airplane.  These events occurred in a two to five minute time span I don’t wish to leave my name but my email is ((deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Falling red light turning into a triangle then shooting south towards the Gulf Of Mexico, then 3 more red balls streaking in same direc;2019-05-20 23:00:00;4 minutes;Falling red light turning into a triangle then shooting south towards the Gulf Of Mexico, then 3 more red balls streaking in same direc I was just outside smoking before bed and was admiring the moon when I noticed a very bright red light falling from the sky, since I live next to the airport I thought it was a plane on fire crashing,  It fell below the tree line and about 30 sec.  later a huge triangular object rose and blacked out the moon, it stayed there for another minute or so then a huge bright light like a headlight shone south and all of a sudden sparks emited from the sides and it took off south heading towards the Gulf.  When it took off it turned into a large red ball and was gone in about 3 seconds.  I couldn’t believe it,  I kept looking at the sky and about 1 minus after the triangle took off, 3 more huge red balls shot from north to south and were visible about 3 seconds. Now there are 2 jets that just came into the airport and 3 military choppers.  I hear them as I’m writing this.  One chopper went below the tree line where the 1st red ball fell.  I came in to write this and I’m going back out to watch. I just came back inside and the choppers are still flying around.  It is now almost Midnight;30.2732;-87.7605999999999
