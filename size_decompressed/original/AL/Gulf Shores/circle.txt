All of sudden the clouds began clustering together and we could see light moving in our direction from behind the clouds. When the clouds cleared there was a circular object hovering about 500 ft. out over the ocean. There was a bright yellow colored light beaming from the object. When we tried to take a picture of the UFO, our digital camera would produce a flash, but there would only be a blank black screen. In fact, we even tried to take pictures of eachother and the same result happened. After about 20 minutes another craft came into view and the two crafts lights began blinking. We were paralyzed with fear and amazement. The crafts stayed there hovering for about 40 more minutes then, we heard a strange humming sound and a loud boom sound as the crafts took off into the sky faster than anything I've ever seen. We went for a walk on the beach at sunrise since we couldn't sleep and found 22 dead sharks down at the water's edge , about 25 ft, from where we had been sitting.;30.2732;-87.7605999999999
