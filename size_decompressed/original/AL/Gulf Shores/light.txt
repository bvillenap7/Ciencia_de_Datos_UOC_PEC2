Unexplained lights seen after aircraft passes over beach.;2005-06-20 21:50:00;30 MINUTES;Unexplained lights seen after aircraft passes over beach. I was vacationing at Gulf Shores this past week June 20th. In the evening we were enjoying the beach around dark sitting and talking in the sand above the breaking waves. We were in the Little Lagoon area of Gulf Shores (address available upon request)   I noticed a twin-engine aircraft approach parallel to the beach at about several thousand feet above the water and about the same distance from shore. Immediately after the plane flew past us, three white lights appeared in the sky above the horizon and below where we had seen the airplane. They were connected in a horizontal line and were very distinct. They seemed to be about the size of aircraft lights that would be from a distant aircraft, perhaps slightly larger.  They were not moving at all and after about 10 seconds,immediately stopped shining. A few minutes later, they appeared again, and then again once more. There were no clouds in the sky except for some high, thin clouds. So it was not clouds which caused the lights to appear and reappear, etc.  Later, a somewhat full moon rose on the horizon to the left of where we spotted these strange lights. There are also several oil rigs out in the Gulf of Mexico below where were saw these lights, however the lights were NOT at sea level. Three of my family members witnessed the lights. We heard no sounds either.;30.2732;-87.7605999999999

Reddish-orange orbs - believe they were Chinese lanterns launched from the beach;2013-08-02 21:00:00;5 minutes;Reddish-orange orbs - believe they were Chinese lanterns launched from the beach We saw a reddish-orange orb moving slowly SW to NE from the beach in Gulf Shores followed about two minutes by a second object.  We believe them to be Chinese lanterns with candles launched from the beach.;30.2732;-87.7605999999999
A ball of white light moved at speeds and directions unlike familiar air crafts above the beach in Gulf Shores, Alabama.;2015-06-04 20:00:00;5 seconds;A ball of white light moved at speeds and directions unlike familiar air crafts above the beach in Gulf Shores, Alabama. (The diagrams and pictures provided are not from the actual event.  Just images to help with explaining what I saw.  The numbers in the pictures explain the path it took starting with 1.) I am a 30 year old male.  I am in Alabama, vacationing at Gulf Shores.   I was playing volleyball on the beach with my family when I saw a ball of light move through the sky unlike any aircraft I've seen before.  I was facing east around 8 p.m., and there was large storm clouds in that direction heading out to the gulf.  Every five minutes or so there would be heat lightning or flashes of lighting that remained in the clouds.  The lightning never made any sounds.   Just before a volley started in a game, my attention was drawn towards a ball of light that came out of the cloud.  It did not make a sound.  It was the size, brightness, and color of a planet being observed in the night sky.  White in color and bright.  The light emitted was consistent, unblinking.   The object started 200 yards away from me over the pink 7 or 8 story building, it was just below the clouds in height.  It moved towards me to the west for about 100 yards, and was over the tan 7 to 8 story building.  I pointed at it and told everyone to look.  Everyone's attention was to the start of the game.   The object then changed direction back to west a 100 yards over the pink building, to the point I first saw it, and then dropped in elevation to what I'm guessing was about 100 feet.  It immediately increased speed and elevation back into the clouds.   As it was in the clouds, the light it emitted was slightly blurred and then not visible.  This all occurred in about five seconds.  I saw it, paused, said hey look at that, it manueverd away from our position, and was gone.  I began to discuss what I saw with members of my family for about 10 minutes after the event.   At the end of that time, a military jet flew along the beach over our heads very loudly.  This was the only time I heard a military jet during the six days I've been at the beach in Gulf Shores.;30.2732;-87.7605999999999
Light seen moving erratically above cloud layer through NVGs. Gulf Shores AL;2020-09-04 21:30:00;15 seconds;Light seen moving erratically above cloud layer through NVGs. Gulf Shores AL While on the beach using a PVS-7 NVG, I was looking at the stars when I noticed what I thought was a satellite moving across the sky.  It was going about as fast as a typical satellite and then stopped and loitered in one position for about 3 seconds and then redirected about 45 degrees and continued for a short distance then stopped again for about 3 seconds.  It repeated this a few more times, each time moving straight a short distance in a random direction and then stopping completely.  It was above cloud height at minimum as I saw it disappear behind some clouds.  This all lasted about 15 seconds total before I lost it behind clouds that were moving in.  It only looked like a dim light through my NVGs and I couldnâ€™t discern any shape due to distance.;30.2732;-87.7605999999999
