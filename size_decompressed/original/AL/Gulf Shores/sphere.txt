Stationary sphere with flashing lights hung for hours;2013-03-27 21:00:00;several hours;Stationary sphere with flashing lights hung for hours Was on vacation in Gulf Shores AL, on the night of March 27 was sitting on a balcony looking out over the gulf and saw what I thought was a plane in a SSW direction.  Left for about two hours and when we came back I noticed it was still there, my binoculars revealed a spherical shape with a very bright red flashing light on the bottom and green and yellow/white lights on top.   It stayed there for several hours and we went to bed.  The following night it was there again, it hung there for several hours and was gone.  Couldn’t judge the distance it was out but best guess would be a few miles.  Checked on the log here and was surprised to see no one else reported it.;30.2732;-87.7605999999999

Skies were clear at time of incident.  We were having conversation, when out of nowhere, right above the treeline, facing the back of house, a green sphere like object just appeared, and shot down below the tree line.  There was no noise from craft. Distance is unknown, but appeared to have dove into the water. We have thought about this all night, and day.  Nothing makes sense.  It wasnt a firework.  It just appeared.  Couldn't have been a boat, a plane, or balloon.;30.2732;-87.7605999999999
Flashing white light hovering near an airport before jetting away at well over 1000 miles an hour without sound.;2021-04-27 10:22:00;10 minutes;Flashing white light hovering near an airport before jetting away at well over 1000 miles an hour without sound. While working to day I looked up in the sky at the clouds and saw a bright flashing white light. The thing hovered in place as the clouds blew right past it and the winds were high. The object then moved from west to east not very far and very slowly. Wasn’t a helicopter because it was way too high wasn’t a drone because drones don’t hold up in the wind like that and obviously wasn’t a plane. The object stayed still for another 5 minutes before turning 90 degrees north and slowly moving off before jetting off at what seemed like light speed and was gone. The object flashed lights on and off in the middle of the day so it couldn’t have been a reflection. I have a 30 second video of the object hovering in place and flashing lights. My co workers and I witnessed the object for 10 or more minutes. I have a great clear video of the object.;30.2732;-87.7605999999999
