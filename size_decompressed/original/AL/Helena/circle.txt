I was outside in my backyard at dusk and suddenly saw a single bright light in the sky.  It appeared as though it was an airplane flying overhead toward me.  The light was there for about 5 seconds and then it just disappeared.  It was as if it went into a cloud, however it was a clear evening and there were no clouds in the sky. I kept looking for the “plane” for a couple of minutes, but never saw it again.;33.2663;-86.902
