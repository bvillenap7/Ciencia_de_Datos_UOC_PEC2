It looked to us as though they were communicating to each other.  The one on the left disappeared.  We tried to video tape the one on the right.  Last night we went outside to check.  It was a cloudy night , so we thought there was no way that we would see anything.  The were no stars, the moon was barely visable, but one of the UFO's was in the same area as the night before, however with the fog, or clouds, we did not get a good look.  This is no joke.  Am trying to find out how to report it. There were UFO sightings in our town years ago that were investigated and are documented from what we have been told.  A lot of people think it's a big joke, but my husband and I have seen them on three seperate times now.;34.4359;-85.9284
