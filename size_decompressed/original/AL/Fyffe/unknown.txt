Huge object close, major lights blinking in sequence, dogs crazy, never seen anything like it.;2014-05-01 21:15:00;5 minutes;Huge object close, major lights blinking in sequence, dogs crazy, never seen anything like it. I was watching TV and noticed a low hum. I waited for the sound to change into the C130â€™s sound that frequently flies over my home.  When the sound did not change, I stepped out on the front porch to see what was causing the sound.   When I looked over the top of my trailer I saw 5 huge flashing lights.  They were flashing in sequence from top to bottom vertically and the lights were bright enough that I could not see the craft.  I realized from the lights that this craft was in my back yard.  The top light was approximately 60 feet off the ground and the bottom light was about 10 feet off the ground, I have a 20 foot and 30 foot trees to compare for height.   At this point I realized what I was seeing and yelled for my wife to come see it.  She came out on the front porch and saw it but it had been changing position to horizontal and the lights were flashing from right to left in sequence.  It surprised me so much that I did not think of going to the backyard until t! his point.   I went inside, grabbed my binoculars and ran out the back door.   The object had already moved about a mile away headed south south west from my home.  I watched until it was nearly out of site, then I saw another craft exactly like the first.  It came from the north west and met the other craft, their lights synchronized and just  disappeared.   I have been looking every night sinse then but nothing has shown.  This happened on May 1, 2014 at 9:15pm. Point of info:   The neighbor's dogs were going crazy until it started to leave, then they got quiet.   Thanks for listening.;34.4359;-85.9284
