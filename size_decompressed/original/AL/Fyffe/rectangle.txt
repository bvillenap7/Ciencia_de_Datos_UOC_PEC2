Huge craft, silent , intelligent, aware of us observing it;1999-04-15 19:00:00;2-3 minutes;Huge craft, silent , intelligent, aware of us observing it My friend and I were Driving down greens chapel road when we saw a light moving in a chevron pattern.  As soon as we became aware of it, it became aware of us and moved tword my vehicle.  As I got closer to it i slowed down, it slowed down as well then I stopped my vehicle in the road.  It stopped and began to lower toward my car it hovered around 20-30ft above us.  It was silent.  It was enourmous blocking out the entire sky.  It looked like a giant steel I beam with three lights.  One on each end and one in the middle.  There was one in the front and back of the vehicle.  I observed a disruption of light when I looked into it.  Like when you look the road in when it is very hot.  This disruption was reflective because when I looked into (in the front of my car I read my car tag.)   After two or three minutes fear overtook us and we spead away stoppping 100 yards from where we were to see the craft dissappearing from the visible horizon.;34.4359;-85.9284
