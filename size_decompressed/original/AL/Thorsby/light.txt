Five silent bright red non blinking lights moved as a group slowly across the sky before disappearing.;2015-10-10 20:40:00;10 minutes;Five silent bright red non blinking lights moved as a group slowly across the sky before disappearing. I witnessed five bright red non-flashing lights moving north to south at an estimated 5 miles from my elevated viewpoint.  From my sighting point due east of Thorsby the lights [when I first noticed them] were at about 28 degrees NE from my location.  My first impression was that the two southern most lights might be wing lights on a banked C-130 which cross the area on occasion, but after watching them it became obvious they were not.  I stood several feet away from a six foot chain link fence post to use it as a witness mark to judge their motion.  The lights were about 15 degrees above the eastern horizon and their brightness and size was comparable to the microwave tower [one mile distant] south of the five moving lights.  After about 10 minutes the leading two lights separated, one upward and the other slightly downward, then shortly disappeared.  The other three trailing lights disappeared very soon after, almost in sequence with one another.  There was never! any sound.
