Twin spheres of light Porter Road near Shady Grove, Adamsville, AL.  ((anonymous report));1998-10-15 22:30:00;5 minutes;Twin spheres of light Porter Road near Shady Grove, Adamsville, AL I had left my brother’s house but wasn’t ready to go straight home, so I decided to take a ride before going home. I went through the Shady Grove area and turned onto Porter Road.  I had probably gone about a mile or so when I saw what appeared to be bright car headlights on a hill in the distance.   As I kept moving down the road in that direction the pair of lights starting rising straight up from the ground into the sky.  I stopped the car trying to figure out what it was.  The lights stayed together until they were about airplane height then burst apart in opposite directions moving faster than anything I’d ever seen.   I turned around in the middle of the road and went home with the hair on the back of my neck standing up.  Felt like I was being watched for several days after.
