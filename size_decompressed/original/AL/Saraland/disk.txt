I observed a shiny saucer shaped object that was motionless in the sky.  The time was around 3:30 pm and the sky was over cast.  The reflection of the little bit of sunlight we had light we had that afternoon was shining against the dark clouds behind it.  It did not move and it appeared to be about a half mile ahead of me,  motionless,  maybe 200 yards above the tree lined  ahead.  I kept thinking, is anyone else on the interstate seeing this?   It did not move at all  while I watched it for about 1 minute and then it instantly disappeared.   I was not frightened at all, but  felt very peaceful about what I had just seemed and curious if any one else driving had witnessed it.  I mentioned it to my mom and husband that night and was very sure of what I had seen.  Today, on my way home around 4:25 pm, I noticed it again, within 2 miles of the first location. It looked exactly as it did the day 3 weeks before, with the the sun reflecting brightly on its top side. The material looked like a brushed nickel finish .   I pulled over immediately to take a picture but it disappeared again.   I will continue to watch for it.  I am curious if anyone else has been seeing them in this area.;30.8319;-88.0944
