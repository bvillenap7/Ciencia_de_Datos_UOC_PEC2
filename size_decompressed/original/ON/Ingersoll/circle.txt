Multiple orange lights moving south to north 50+.;2012-11-22 21:30:00;~10 minutes;Multiple orange lights moving south to north 50+ A large number of orange lights were traveling in a south to north direction. Just above the tree line, it started with two following each othere followed by a third then more and more.  Some overtaking each other but all around the same height in the air.  None accending or decending though.  All seemed to be maintaing alttitude.  No flashing lights, no tails just orange balls..   This went on for approx 10 mins.  We got in the car and headed to the other side of town for a better view but by the time we got across town we saw nothing.  There was no sound but these lights were quite far away.;43.0347;-80.8780999999999
