Never seen anything like it I went over to my parent's house to sit in their hottub.  My mother joined me.  It was a very clear night, so we decided to just lean back and look at the stars.  We saw a few planes fly overhead, and then we noticed something strange...  we saw what appeared to be a star moving South across the sky.  It was moving at a very high rate of speed.  We thought at first it was an airplane, but there were absolutely no flashing lights.  We watched it until we couldn't see it anymore.  Approximately 3 minutes later, we saw a second craft travelling the exact same flight path.  This time, the craft got extremely bright (no flashing lights - the entire craft went bright), then faded and disappeared.  We then saw two more of these crafts heading North (we have no idea if they were the same two we saw before).  Again, one of these went brilliantly bright.  We then saw one craft heading East.  This was was quite dull.  We saw approximately 10 to 12 more travelling in different directions.  Not all of these crafts travelled in a straight line.  Two that I can remember we sort of swaying to the left and right as it passed above us.  As the night wore on, we saw a few more, but they were very dull and seemed to disappear before our eyes.  We have NO idea what these were.  We've sat in that hottub many, many clear nights and have never seen anything like this before. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sightings are of satellites.
