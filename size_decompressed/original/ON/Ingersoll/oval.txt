After 2-3 minutes the light move slowly to the left amd then hovered to our left over farmland...I believe it was quite far away but quite low over the field. It started to slowly move back and fourth and up and down..some movements were quisker than others.  I stopped the car to watch...there was no sound at all except crickets..I was facinated but my date was scared and clung to me.  After another 2-3 minutes ...it seemed to fly away so fast that it diapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.0347;-80.8780999999999
