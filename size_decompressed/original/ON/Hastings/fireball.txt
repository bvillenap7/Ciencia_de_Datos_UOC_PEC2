Fluorescent green fireball with pinkish-purple tail passes overhead twice in span of 15 minutes.;2006-06-15 00:30:00;~15 minutes;Fluorescent green fireball with pinkish-purple tail passes overhead twice in span of 15 minutes One night in June of 2006 (I canâ€™t remember the exact date), the family and myself were sitting out having a late night campfire at our cottage, it was about 12:30 am, and everyone was just about to call it a night, when a bright, fluorescent green fireball with a pinkish-purple tail streaked across the sky in a southwest to northeast trajectory, passing directly overhead, and moving over the town about a 15 to 20 min walk away.  This object was bright enough to light up both sides of the Trent River like it was noon.  The speed of this object was also unfathomable moving over my property, across the town, and out of sight in the span of what felt like 2 seconds. Approximately 15 minutes later, the same object or what appeared to be the same object passed overhead again only this time in a west north-west to East south east trajectory.  This object was also dead silent both times it passed overhead.  Where we are located we get beautiful night skies and shooting stars are a common occurrence.  As well are military aircraft from Canadian Forces Base Trenton located 25 miles to our southeast. In the 34 years we have owned this property, we have never seen anything like this before, or since, and to this day, I still have no idea what it was we saw that night.

Fireball observed July 1st Canada Day evening just before fireworks, crossing sky slightly upwards, south south east then disappearing.;2010-07-01 21:40:00;5 min;Fireball observed July 1st Canada Day evening just before fireworks, crossing sky slightly upwards, south south east then disappearing. Just before the start of Canada Day fireworks, we observed to the east a fireball approximately the size of a searchlight of a helicopter.  It was hard to judge the size because we did not know the distance away of the object.  It travelled slowly south southeast at an upward angle from the horizon of only around 20 degrees, maybe less. We do not know the visual origin of the light as it only caught our eye when already in the sky.  We watched it climb and cross the sky and then it just disappeared.  It was orange and circular.   This was observed by myself, a 43 yr old man and my 2 children, 13 and 10 yrs old.;44.3025;-77.9531
