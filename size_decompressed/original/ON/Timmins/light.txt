I was hesitating to post this because I didn't want anyone to think I'm crazy.  But then I realized it couldn't hurt to describe what I seen. I was looking out my bedroom window one evening in the Fall (end of October) it was near midnight. Directly ahead of me in the sky, I watched mesmerized as a light was in the sky, it was a round, full density light..a ball of light. I didn't think anything of it, figuring it might be a plane but it was too big and round. But the thing that made me gasp was that one minute it was there, and the next minute, it was as though someone slipped a black blanket over the light, cause it vanished. There was no movement, no speed of light. It was like a candle being snuffed out, because the ball of light vanished in the spot it was in. Maybe it wasn't a UFO I seen, but it sure was strange and I have never forgotten it. Nor have I told anyone in my town what I seen. As I said I dont want anyone to think it's one of my wild imaginations because I'm a writer. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD));48.4695588235295;-81.3297941176469
