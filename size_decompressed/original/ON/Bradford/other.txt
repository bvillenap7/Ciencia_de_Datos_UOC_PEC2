The first ones I saw took the shape of an upside down little dipper.  The lights were like orange in colour.  They came from no where and just formed the little dipper perfectly.  Then slowly they disappeard,then nothing.  I walked a few seconds down my street turned around and this time when I turned around and saw a hole bunch of them.  My neighbours saw them too.  One of them took a picture of these lights.  As we watched them coming from no where they formed a triangle and then they disappeard again.   Then a couple of seconds later only one came from no where and just stayed in one spot for a couple of seconds and then also disappeard.  There was no sound like you would expect if it were something with an engine and with those many lights, it would have been very loud.  We waited to see if anything else would happen.  We waited for about 20 minutes but nothing happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Date above has been corrected.  PD));44.1218;-79.5645
