((HOAX??))  Flying Saucer an hour north of TORONTO CANADA;2012-03-20 22:50:00;7 minutes;Flying Saucer an hour north of TORONTO CANADA Today I decided to open my window since it has been very nice weather. I heard the sounds of a large running machine also with the sound of air being vented.  Similar to the sounds of a large jet plane, my instinct was that it was a plane.  But when I noticed the sound was as if it was closer to the ground then most aircraft and the sound of the engine wasnt going away as if the craft was flying away.  So I had noticed this was around for too long I decided to look out the window.  To my amazement this craft was not a plane, it was hovering north-east, it had 4 flashing blue lights flickering in a circle motion with a center white light.  It wasn't flying fast enough to be a jet plane. I went down stairs to get my camera which would have provided a good picture, but the battery was dead.  I really wanted to tell someone, if i could call a number that isnt long distance I would.  The craft slowly traveled north-east and the blue lights disappeared but the white ligh! t remained.  Then 4 white lights flashed very bright all of a sudden in a different timing synced with the other lights flashing.  Once it was out of sight I looked at the sky, I looked at all the stars or what seemed like stars.  I noticed 2 distant lights that looked like stars, they were getting closer to each other into 1 light, then seperated and it was as if 2 stars were there.  They kept getting closer and coming apart for a few minutes then disappeared.;44.1218;-79.5645
