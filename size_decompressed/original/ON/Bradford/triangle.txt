Two triangular, one flat.  Very bright lights on two.  One stationary, two moving East to West. While preparing to retire for the night, I noticed very bright lights out the window to the south.  The weather no precipitation, partly cloudy, no moon, stars could be seen.  Observation makes without aid as well as celestron 15*70 binoculars. The objects were brighter than the stars and any aircraft light ever seen.  That's why went outside to observe as this is not what use to seeing.  As we see aircraft all the time day and night.  Typical navigation light patterns.  Went outside to get a better look.  Appeared to be same distance as King City weather radar dome from where I stood.  Saw three objects.  The objects appeared to be different shapes.  Two appeared to be the same.  The shapes were deduced by the lights seen on the craft.  Two seemed to be triangular and one flat shaped.  The triangular ones were multicoloured, red, green, blue, white, amber and the flat shaped only red.  One seemed larger than the other two.  There were no spot lights or beams observed. They first appeared to line up perfectly from east to west.  Middle object appeared to be stationary while east and west object moved around centered  object.  Two objects at first seemed to move SW then would reappear from the east.  Couldn't see them head from west to east.  After about 30 minutes one headed in a SW direction followed by the other (red) 5 minutes later then the larger one.  They all headed SW then there was nothing only to have them reappear 10 minutes later. When reappearing seemed to be further away, still a southerly direction.  After another 10 minutes of moving around they disappeared to the SW again.;44.1218;-79.5645
