Bright light hovering in horizon in Waterdown Ontario.;2014-04-29 23:30:00;25 minutes;Bright light hovering in horizon in Waterdown Ontario. I was driving down highway 6 from Guelph when I noticed a very bright light in the sky hovering on the horizon to the east.   The light would get very intense and then fade very faint after a few minutes then would brighten up again.  This brightening had no set pattern.   When I turned down paradise drive it seem to be hovering over the road.  And started to move left to right and almost seems to rotate.   When I go home and let the dogs out i could still see it through the trees.  Moving and getting frighten then fading.
