Cigar shaped object spotted by Canadian teachers in Ontario;2003-07-15 15:00:00;5 minutes;Cigar shaped object spotted by Canadian teachers in Ontario Last summer my wife and I who are both teachers, were in the backyard enjoying a beautiful afternoon relaxing on the deck.   As we were engaged in conversation, I saw something up in the sky that caught my attention.   It was a perfect day with a clear blue sky, so I know I wasn't mistaken about seeing this object.  I notioned to my wife who looked up just as bewildered as myself.   In a short distance from us, we could see a cigar shaped silvery looking object that was motionless in the sky.  It clearly wasn't a plane or some other object that could rationally be described, as it was truly unique to anything we have ever seen.   As we stared at it for a minute or two, it suddenly moved in a darting motion to it's left, then it darted again quickly to it's right, and it moved irradically for a another minute or two after that.  Again after a moment, it remained motionless in the sky without any apparent moment.  It was at this moment that after the rush of excitemnt had passed, I decided to get my camera to get a picture of this thing.   However, as fate would have it, it disappeared within the time I had rushed to go into the house.  My wife said that the object left at lightening speed directly upwards into the sky.   I would have wrote about this sooner however, I was unaware that this site existed.  This is not some fabricated story made up to get attention or publicity as I simply want to tell those interested that we are obviously not alone.   I also want to say for the record, that this is mt third sighting of a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.3309;-79.8872000000001
