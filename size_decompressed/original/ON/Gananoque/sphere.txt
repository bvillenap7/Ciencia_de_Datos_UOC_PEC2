6 large, fast moving and silent orange spheres travelling in formation.;2011-10-08 21:00:00;30 seconds;6 large, fast moving and silent orange spheres travelling in formation. My wife and I were staying overnight at an island in the 1000 Islands. It was a very clear evening, and were outside watching the stars, facing north. I went inside for a moment and then my wife called me to come out and see the sky.  There was a bright orange coloured ball moving silently from east to west.  I couldn't tell how high in the sky it was, but it was brighter than the north star and larger, so it was probably lower.  It was moving at a good rate of speed, but much slower than a satellite, faster than a passenger jet.  I thought it may have been a satellite, but if it was it was enormous. I have seen fighter jets coming out of the American air base south of us before, in the daytime, flying in formation, and they are loud and obvious.  (And they probably shouldn't be flying into Canadian airspace, but they do.)  This was quite different. While the first orange sphere proceeded across the sky in a straight path, two more appeared behind it, one on either side, then another two, and finally one at the tail end.  So kind of a formation, maybe a pentangle shape.  This kind of freaked us both out. All of them appeared to be travelling together, same rate of speed. They continued east to west until we could no longer see them. There was absolutely no sound at all. They were very round, but at the rear end (facing east) they looked blurry.  Strangest thing we have ever seen! Too bad nobody can actually say what they are.;44.3322;-76.1676
