Very bright light shining in bedroom window;2010-10-05 03:35:00;1 MINUTE;Very bright light shining in bedroom window  I woke up at 3.30 am and went to washroom.  Rinsed out my mouth and returned to bed. I was just getting comfortable again when a flash of light opened my eyes. The bedroom appeared as if there was a bright moonlit night.   Then a very bright light was shinining threw the window as if searching my bedroom for something.  The bright light went from bottom of window to top of ceiling and only lasted seconds. I reluctantly went to the window and peaked threw window blind but could not see anything. I find this very disturbing and would like to know if any other reports from the area have come to your attention.;42.8879;-79.0462
