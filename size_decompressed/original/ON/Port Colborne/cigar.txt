WEATHER CONDITION: Sunny and clear.  OBJECT:   Cigar shape with rectangular wings. Wings were longer than the body of craft(individually longer).The wings were wider than the width of the craft.

Wings also appeared white but difficult to judge because it was reflecting the sun's light.  DIRECTION TRAVELLING: It was in the Eastern sky proceeding North West. It deviate a bit and headed West. Approximately five minutes of observation when I lost it in the sun.  SPEED: Slow for an aircraft, including small beechcraft-type but faster than blimp.  LOCATION: Canal Days - Festival.
