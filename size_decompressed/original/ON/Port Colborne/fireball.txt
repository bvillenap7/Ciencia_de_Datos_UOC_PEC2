Red glowing object with burning red cape;2009-10-03 20:44:00;2 minutes;Red glowing object with burning red cape A red glowing object with what looked like a red burning cape started from the south. It seemed low and at first, maybe some sort of pyrotechnic display.  After moving higher and to the north the burning cape seemed to disappear but the red glowing ball was still moving in a northern direction. To describe its path better, picture the pattern the moon takes as it is rising, but speed it up so it happens in a couple minutes instead of 8 hours.  The object went behind trees and I was able to see it once through some branches, then I never saw it again.  This object made no sudden movements, but looked like it had some sort of flight plan.;42.904;-79.2333
