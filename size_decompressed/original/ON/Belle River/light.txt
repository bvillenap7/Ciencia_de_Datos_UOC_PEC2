I was letting my dog out one last time for the night and like usually I glanced up at the stars.  I was looking to the east at what I think was a planet.  Not sure though. I noticed the object next to it.  I thought it was a star and I staired at it for about 7 minutes. Then all of a sudden it began to move slowly and shot off into the horizon.  It travelled eastward out of my view.  Its speed was incredible.  I have never really told anyone about this, but I thought it would be good for someone to know.  Maybe somehow...someway...someone else saw this.;42.1786;-82.7662
