We were at a very large gathering at a beer tent with a concert taking place there on the Belle River pier.  These objects caught my eye floating at different speeds coming from inland traveling along the pier and then they all went out over the lake in the exact same direction.   I noticed them right away since they looked exactly like what I had seen in Port Elgin ON earlier in the month (already submitted that report).   I pointed it out to my wife and other friends.   Objects made no noise and were about 80-100 ft in the air.;42.1786;-82.7662
