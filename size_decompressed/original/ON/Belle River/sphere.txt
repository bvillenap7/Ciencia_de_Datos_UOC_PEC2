3 Glowing, erratically moving, low in sky objects spotted;2006-09-26 23:20:00;30 minutes;3 Glowing, erratically moving, low in sky objects spotted Sitting outside in hottub on mentioned date and time.   My husband and I witnessed a spherical glowing object travelling southwest.  It was too low and bright to be a satellite and not a shooting star as it glowed continuously.   Object was travelling a steady straight course when it suddenly and abruptly switched directions about 45 degrees.  Approximately twenty minutes later I spotted a similar object travelling the same speed from east to west.  It was perfectly round and had a pinkish almost translucent glow to it.  Friend who was present also spotted similar object travelling north at the same time.   I have never seen anything like this.;42.1786;-82.7662
