Lighted object over Maxville ON CA 23:50 21 May 02.;2002-05-21 23:50:00;5 seconds;Lighted object over Maxville ON CA 23:50 21 May 02. At approximately 23:50 on 21 May 2002 I was driving north on Highland Road between Maxville Ontario and highway 417. I noticed some light to the west moving north in a downward direcxtion. The object was between highway 138 and Highland road over a wooded area. At first I thought it was a meteorite but noticed it left no trail from atmospheric friction. Looking at the object I saw two red lights beside each other with a white light above and between the two red lights. The object then levelled and headed north very quickly. It travelled approximately 20 to 30 kms in about 5 seconds when I lost sight of it due to trees. I am a technical specialist.;45.2933;-74.8522
