I thought it was a shooting star.;2002-07-01 01:30:00;2-3 sec;I thought it was a shooting star. Around 1:30 am est. I was at the Cottage restaurant and bar in Huntsville Ontario for the long weekend. My group were all out on the patio having a drink, when I looked up to see a shooting star. I was travelling at the same speed as a shooting star, but it was two round, orange, objects heading west. The circles were almost flying together as in a formation. They then split up and headed upwards in seperate directions through the clouds, into the night sky. It happened so fast I didn't know what to make of it. I have never seen anything like that in my life.;45.3302000000001;-79.2188000000001
