Light seen over ridge in Algonquin park.;2003-09-16 00:00:00;10 to 15 mins;Light seen over ridge in Algonquin park. We were staying at the Canisby camping grounds in Algonquin Park, and one clear crisp night we (all 4 of us) decided to walk down to the beach to watch the stars. It must have been close to midnight, and the sky was completely  clear and all the stars were blazing bright. We walked down and stood on the beach for a while looking up and watch everything. A few shooting stars had gone over head and so we were really watching closely for anything . I had looked over to the ridge of hills on the far left side of the lake and I thought there was a radio tower with a flahing light on top of it. I pointed it out and then we realized that the light was far too high above the ridge to be a tower. The light wasn't moving and there was no sound at all. It was flashing white, red and green all lights were visable at all times, but the colours pulsed, but did not move or get smaller or larger.. We actually stood looking at it for a few minutes trying to figure out what it could be. And then to the right of the lake the full moon had come out from behind a small cloud, we all moved further down the beach to look over at it. About 10 mins later when we were about to leave the beach and go back to our camp, I looked back over to the ridge and the lights were gone completely. There wasn't time enough for it to fly away, if it was an airplane, we still would have seen it. The sky was so clear that any direction it would have gone we would have been able to track it,,, but the sky was clear.;45.3302000000001;-79.2188000000001
