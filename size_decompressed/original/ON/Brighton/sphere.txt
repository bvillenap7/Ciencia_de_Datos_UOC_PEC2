Big sphere hovering over Lake Ontario;2011-10-25 21:30:00;15 min;Big sphere hovering over Lake Ontario http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_owCFO79tWg   On the evening of Tuesday the 25th day of October, my friend and I witnessed this object, due south of Salem Ontario which is just a bit west of Brighton Ontario. The object appeared twice once to the west of the original position.  It was quite large.  The light emminating from the object reflected on the night sky above it.  It revealed the clouds above it and reflected off of the lake. In my estimation the object was very close to Rochester New York, USA.  Given the size of the object and it's proximity to the Lake it seemed at least half way across the Lake by guestimation. It remained in the sky until it flashed out.  Some time later it reappeared and then flashed out once again.  The video quality is quite good and a larger file is available that I have uploaded to the You Tube site. I have been unable to contact the other witness.  He is a tad reclusive and won't take any calls. There was a red light to the east, smaller but moving around a bit.;44.0473;-77.7473
