2 thin horizontal orange lines coming together and fading away.;2014-12-18 17:00:00;5-7 minutes;2 thin horizontal orange lines coming together and fading away Around two years ago my father, Eldon called and reported a ufo sighting in Ottawa, Canada. Near thanksgiving time (canada). Ever since, we have kept our eyes out for sightings. Not to long ago, I was on the phone with my father while he was driving home from work.  He was about an hour ways from where I am.  He tells me he sees an orange line in the sky, he tells me to go outside and look so I do so.  I look around for a couple seconds and I notice it.  The thin, distinct orange line was located slightly above the sun's horizon (the sun was setting at the time).  The line started moving to the right for around a minute, then just stayed in place.  At this point I realize that what I'm looking at is not a jet, the line stayed the same size and remained very thin.   Then, after the line sitting in place for around 10 seconds, another line from the same line started moving to the left.  So, you have the same line remaining in the same spot, and then another line moving to the left away from that line.   Now, the two lines were apart.  At a bit of a faster speed then they were separating, the two lines start getting closer and closer together and now they are combined into one line again.   At this point, I run inside to get my mother and we get outside and its still there in the sky, in the same spot.  A couple seconds later, it slowly fades away.  The line/lines are gone now.  When they faded away, I also saw sort of like a magnetic force shot up through the sky.  Thank you for reading my report.;48.6129;-80.9337
