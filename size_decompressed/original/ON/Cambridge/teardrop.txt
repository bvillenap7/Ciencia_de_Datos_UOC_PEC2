2 objects seen when mistaken for a balloon in cambridge ontario june 12 2013.;2013-06-12 04:40:00;3 minutes;2 objects seen when mistaken for a balloon in cambridge ontario june 12 2013. sitting out on our deck at 4:40 pm ontario time, my wife and i saw an object drifting NNW to NWdirection so slowly that I though it was a balloon and going behind a tree.   Took 1 photo and waited for it to reappear from behind the tree but it never did.   After a few minutes of waiting I reviewed the photo and only then noted that there were 2 objects in the picture.  Closer viewing showed the larger object flat bottomed and the fainter object, tubular in shape.  Waited 10 minutes but no other showings of these objects I have good 1 quality picture of the event.;43.3863542222223;-80.2867346666667
