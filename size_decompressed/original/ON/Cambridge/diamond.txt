Five bright objects over Ontario engaged in dogfight, daylight sighting.;2001-03-19 13:00:00;5 minutes;Five bright objects over Ontario engaged in dogfight, daylight sighting. At approx 1 pm I observed five objects almost directly overhead flying in what could best be described as a dogfight. The sky was completely clear with the sun shining.  Passenger jet traffic was clearly visible with airplane detail quite clear.  These objects appeared to be much higher, or smaller, or both than the passenger jets. They played in a spiraling motion much like what you would see in a Top Gun movie.  It could have been military aircraft in practice manuevers, however the aircraft were too high to make out any definitive shape.  They appeared to be triangular and shone in the sunlight quite briliantly at times.  After several minutes one of the aircraft departed in a Northwest direction.  It passed behind (over) the contrail of a passing 747.  I lost sight of the other objects when I looked back to them.  About 10 to 15 minutes later I saw two of the objects come from the Northwest loop around come together very close, split apart and both departed in a North, Northwest direction.  From what I saw no actions were taken that would be impossible for a military fighter, but it would have to have been performing to the limits of it's capabilities. It looked like they had the agility of a kite or bird, but were much too high to be that. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means March 19, not April 19.  We amend the date here.
