My brother, his friend and I were watching a moon eclipse.  The moon was in the east south sky.  To the right of the moon, we saw what we thought were stars, suddenly jumble about like flies flying around each other. The points of light flew into a triangle formation with the point pointing at the moon, and flew off towards the moon at great speed.  The entire triangle flew as one unit, but before the lights made the formation they flew as independant objects. Again - the individual U.F.o's looked like stars.

Two triangles with lights;2003-06-03 02:00:00;about three minutes;Two triangles with lights we were in a park, 2 am when we saw two lights in the sky. They were changing colors and hovering. they would stay still, then move slightly, hover for a bit longer, then move again. About three minutes later They flashed white, shot across the sky and were gone. The crafts were triangle shaped and the lights went from green to red to yellow to blue and back to green.;43.3863542222223;-80.2867346666667
