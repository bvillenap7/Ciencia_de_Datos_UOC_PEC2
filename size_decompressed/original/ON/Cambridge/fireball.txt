Orange fireball SSE sighted in Cambridge, Ontario.;2012-08-05 22:00:00;4 minutes;Orange fireball SSE sighted in Cambridge ontario At appx 22:00 on Sunday the 5th of August I went outside to put the garbage out and saw a bright orange glow in the sky (SSE) which hovered then moved very slowly. I got my wife and she witnessed the same sight.  The object lowered its position and we could not see it till moving along the street (it was hidden by a neighbours tree). The orange glow moved gradually further south and in a lower position from the one where it was first sighted. The whole time period was appx five minutes. We are (my wife and I) are skeptics of the things but we know what we saw.;43.3863542222223;-80.2867346666667
