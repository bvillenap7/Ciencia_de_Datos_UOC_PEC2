Strange flying object changing shape and only visible through certain camera devices.;2014-04-16 22:45:00;>15 minutes;Strange flying object changing shape and only visible through certain camera devices. I thought I saw something strange about/around the moon so I tried to take a picture of it.   When I started to focus on it with my tablet, I saw this strange thing that was swirling, and flying around the moon.  It flew down and touched the ground then went back up to the right side of the moon.  I tried to take a picture with my smart phone but it was not able to capture it.   The thing changed shape and seemed to get larger and smaller multiple times throughout the whole event.   I called my husband out and he couldn't see it until he looked through my tablet.  He took a picture on his phone and was also able to capture an image of it.   At one point there was also a huge haze of orange/red around the object.;43.3863542222223;-80.2867346666667
