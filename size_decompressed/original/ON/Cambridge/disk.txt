HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object that shoots off at a fast rate of speed across the sky nad video taped.;2004-05-01 20:30:00;approx 1 minute;Object that shoots off at a fast rate of speed across the sky nad video taped. (Looking towards Acton)  Another call came in from a fellow who again witnessed something that looked out of place in the sky and he also shot some footage of what he witnessed. The man and his wife had some family members over to their home. The witness had been telling his sisters boyfriend about what they saw on April 24, 2004. The witnesses sisters boyfriend looked out the window and commented, it wouldn't be the light on the tower over there?  The witness said, what tower !  The witness looked out the window and there again was something flying around the sky. There is no tower in the area where the sisters boyfriend was pointing out.  This time the witness grabbed his video camera and started to take some footage. Now he admits that he is a ammeter photographer and just doing his best to get a shot of what they were observing in the sky. With the excitement of seeing something strange he admits there is shake when viewing the footage, but all of the family members who watched the film says it is very interesting to watch and the fellow still gets the shot.  There was no multiple lights seen this time, only one object that shoots off at a fast rate of speed across the sky. The man who is filming this object, puts the camera down for a brief second as he was discussing what he was seeing with his sisters boyfriend. When he looked up again, the light/object was back where it originally was, or when the witness first saw it. Like the man said, it seemed impossible for something to move so quickly across the sky and return to the  spot from where it came from.  When viewing the tape back at a slow speed the fellow says you can almost see the outline of the thing, the classic saucer shaped craft. Also still viewing the tape on the slow speed they tell me you can see a burst of  color, purple pinkish.  We will see what the investigator who will be visiting the witnesses comes up with.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  One thing I would like to add. It was quick thinking that the witness thought to grab his video camera. I would suggest that folks keep a camera of some sort with them, or close by. One never knows when something like this will happen to them.
