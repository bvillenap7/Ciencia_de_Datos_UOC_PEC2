In the sky it was about the size of half a dime, and it was a very deep orange colour.  It came from the East and flew directly over head of us.  We realized it was a U.F.O when the object made two perfect 90 degree turns right after eachother.  Again it was completely silent.  It continued to fly straight to the west and dissapeared in the horizon ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.3863542222223;-80.2867346666667

I hit it with a high power hand held laser pointer  it avoided the laser beam moving in a zigzag back and forth motion, then started moving behind the trees and took off like a shooting star and made a sonic boom.;43.3863542222223;-80.2867346666667
