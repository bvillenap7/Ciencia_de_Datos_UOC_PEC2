We were just lining up to head in from recess when I looked eastward from my position and saw an oval object hovering. It did so for about 5 seconds and then began rapidly ascending straight up, then after about 1 second it turned southward and dissapeared behind a cloud and came out the other side. It then stopped and hovered for about 15 seconds, then at an extremely high rate of speed traveled north and up at about a 75 degree angle and dissapeared. the object was oval, silver in colour, and very shiny.
