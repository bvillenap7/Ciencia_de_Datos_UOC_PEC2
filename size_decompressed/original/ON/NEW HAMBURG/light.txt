3 white lights flying in a 300 foot (plus) evenly spaced horizontal formation. 2 witnesses;2019-05-26 23:40:00;2 or 3 mins;3 white lights flying in a 300 foot (plus) evenly spaced horizontal formation. 2 witnesses I was standing on my deck just before midnight after letting my dog out.  The deck is at the back of my house facing west.  I was looking up at the stars (very clear night) in the northern sky, specifically the big dipper formation.  At that point a grouping stars caught my eye because I hadn’t noticed them earlier.  I then realized they were moving in formation.  There were 3 bright white lights that were moving in a perfect horizontal line heading north east.  The formation in my estimation was anywhere from 300 feet to much grater depending on if they were actually satellite height or higher.  It was difficult to tell how far away they were but I would guess they were at passenger jet height.  There was at minimum a 100 foot gap, or again much greater, between each light and I was unable to hear sound.  As they were going by they moved slowly enough for me to shout at my wife several times to wake her up in the house on the couch sleeping.  She finally came out and! saw the lights a few seconds before they disappeared behind the neighborhood trees.  My wife said she saw them as red lights where I saw bright white lights.  We think the discrepancy was because she had just opened her eyes from sleeping.  They weren’t flashing, they resembled slowly moving stars. We cannot explain this encounter to be anything less than incredible.  There is no question that my wife and I saw something we can’t explain away or say that we saw anything that resembles a man made machine.;43.4001;-80.6497
