There was about 30 people having a  large camp fire, playing guitars and singing songs. Most of us seen it and my wife and a bunch of kids tried to follow it out towards a bush area then over lake huron. Once it was pass the trees it was then over the lake and out of site. There was no sound at all. It traveled NW over the camp complex towards the lake. It glowed and seemed to pulsate as it passed.;44.6941;-81.0962
