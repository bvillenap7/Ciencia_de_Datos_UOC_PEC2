UFO sighting behind my motel.;2021-03-01 23:35:00;5 minutes;UFO sighting behind my motel. My friend and I went to get coffee and returned to our motel when a man knocked on my window and said “You gotta see this, there are UFOs in the the sky.” My friend said “I believe him, let’s go see.” We walked to the back of the motel and looked at the sky. We saw at least 15 lights in a linear formation travelling North and then they disappeared. The man said the lights appeared just before 10 the first time where he counted about 18 lights. About an hour and a half later the lights appeared again when we were present. The man said there must of been about 50 lights but he lost count because they were going by so fast. I did some research about any UFO sightings in the area and I came across an article.  I will attach a link on the article about a naked man who experienced the UFO sightings behind the motel 7 years prior on July 9th: https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.owensoundsuntimes.com/2013/07/09/naked-man-ufos-and-bears-reported-in-saugeen-shores/wcm/c7942578-a6e4-3d75-14c1-382aa2c24b2f/amp/;44.6941;-81.0962
