Seen a orange glowing ball hovering over the town of Tecumseh, ON;2012-08-24 21:30:00;5 minutes;My friends and I seen a orange glowing ball hovering over the town of Tecumseh, ON.  We were at a April Wine concert, at the Corn Fest in Lacasse Park. Midway through the show I noticed the object hovering above the tree line E of the edge of the park.  It was going N towards the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair.  It did not seem to be flying straight but more like floating.  Then it disappeared behind the tree line and it made no noise at all.  There was at least 500 at the concert and probably 2000 at the Corn Fest so I am sure I am not the only one who seen it.  Being it was the same exact looking object i seen in Port Elgin ON and Belle River ON the month before, I knew right away what I was seeing...  It feels to me like they want to expose themselves a little bit at a time to large groups in order to prep us for full disclosure.;42.2969590909091;-82.8631727272727
