Orange fireball shape changer.;2013-08-25 01:00:00;15 seconds;Orange fireball shape changer. Wanted to report a strange orange glowing ball in the sky.  I got out of my car and noticed it right away in the sky from my driveway.  Had to take a double look because I couldn't make out what I was seeing.  It seemed like it was something on fire in the sky, it was round but also seemed to change shape, like it was getting larger or wiggling around?  Not sure, I watched it for a few more seconds enough to ascertain that it wasn't really moving at any high rate of speed,  so I went inside to grab the husband.  Was only in the house for half a minute and it was gone when we got back outside.  No planes or anything in the distance that we could see.  I'm 35 years old, I work at a library here in town, I was sober.  What did I just see?;42.2969590909091;-82.8631727272727
