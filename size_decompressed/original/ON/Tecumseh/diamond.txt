Whitish Grey Diamond Shaped UFOs;2008-11-28 22:30:00;10 seconds;Whitish Grey Diamond Shaped UFOs We were looking up at the night sky with binoculars.  I was told to point them towards a plane, then I heard my fiance say whats that, just as something flashed across the lenses...  I was able to follow it and with the binoculars I witnessed 5 diamond shape objects flying in unison like a flock of birds, but there was no wings and the shapes were whites grey  almost opaque.  No lights flashing, thats why I'm still hesitant about spreading the word...   It couldn't have been birds??  It was almost as if they were connected because the way they maneuvered, the space between them did not get larger or smaller.   I lost them through the binoculars and when I put them down they were out of sight.   Very weird object indeed!;42.2969590909091;-82.8631727272727
