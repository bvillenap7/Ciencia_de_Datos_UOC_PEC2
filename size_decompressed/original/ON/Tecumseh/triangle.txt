Object appeared to be triangular with 3 white lights on each side and one single red light at the rear.  The body appeared to be dark metal.  The noise was faint but but similar to an air compressor.  As I pulled over to get a better look, I took my eye off the object for approximately 7 seconds. When I looked back up this object was completely gone.  Clear sky.  Nothing in sight;42.2969590909091;-82.8631727272727
