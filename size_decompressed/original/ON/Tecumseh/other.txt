I am a licensed electrician working for One of the big 3 automakers on 3 weeks vacation not drinking alcohol or taking any mind altering substance. Talking with my father on a portable phone with head set in the living room sitting on a lazy boy  chair looking out south window at the sky talking about (I don't remember but was feeling calm and relaxed) when I noticed an object at about 50 degrees up in the south south east sky that was about as big as a pea at arms length.  It was bobbing up and down and wobbling back and forth and side to side all the while moving linearly from my right to left. It covered about 5 - 10 degrees of arc in that easterly vector.  The surface of the craft was like  polished black granite. The shape was circular about 30% high as wide and the sides seemed to be made of flat triangular sections that reflected the sun in a clear blue sky as it bobbed and wobbled. After watching for about 20 seconds I left to get my binoculars for about 20 seconds and when I got back it was not visible. There was no audible sound from inside the house during the siting. Temperature outside was about 60 F.  No wind. Slight haze on the horizon. No other visual observers present. Described the experience to my father as it was happening.  Have always felt that I would one day see a UFO out this window as I sat there. Was happy and excited to unexpectedly see it. Disappointed that it disappeared before seeing it through the binoculars.;42.2969590909091;-82.8631727272727
