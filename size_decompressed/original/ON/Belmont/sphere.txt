Glowing orange/red probes appeared to be studying small rural town;2000-03-15 21:00:00;10 min.;Glowing orange/red probes appeared to be studying small rural town I was walking down a street heading south with my dog when I seen what appeared to be a basketball(of course it wasn't) buzz across some treetops maybe 1000ft. away. The first time I saw it, it was only for a few seconds but it was very ominous, silent and appeared to be controlled remotely. Its colour was orange and red, it was perfectly round. Once I got to the end of the street I started walking west(right) then south(left) then east(left). I am now at my folks house and this trip only takes about 15-20 min. on foot. As I was cutting up through their backyard I happened to turn around and their it was for the second time and it looked like it was over the spot, above the street a 1000ft. or so where I saw it the first time this time I am faceing north and it is flying over houses to the east(my right) and as it flew to the edge of town, wich is about a k.m away from my position it took on a 45 degree angle of flight, to the east, started to accelerate, and it's colour switcher off all in just a few seconds. A few nights later out in the country a friend had described the same thing to me as I had seen, even the way it departed. ((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate.
