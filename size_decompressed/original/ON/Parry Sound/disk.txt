Just after sunset, on Thanksgiving, I observed an aircraft, overhead, traveling south, at about 20'000 ft. I saw a bright object that I first thought was Venus or Jupiter. It began to move, perpendicular to the aircraft, at about the same speed. It appeared to be a silvery, disk shaped object, 20 to 30 feet across and it was self-illuminated. It passed over the aircraft. It then dissolved into the blue. Jupiter was seen in a different part of the sky later that night. Venus was seen the next morning. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
