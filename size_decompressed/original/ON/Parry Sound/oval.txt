Low altitude silent solid fluorescent Orange and Red object over beach in summer.;2013-08-10 23:00:00;1 minute;Low altitude silent solid fluorescent Orange and Red object over beach in summer. My sweetheart and I saw a bluish light travelling very quickly 2 nights prior to this experience:  We were sitting around the campfire.  A light coming from the west just over the trees caught the corner of my eye.  We immediately got up and ran to the beach within seconds as the site backed onto the beach.  There were others looking for creates in the water with their flashlights at the time.  The solid orange and red fluorescent light object moved above and across us on the beach at an altitude of about 100M. After about 20 seconds of it slowly moving, I started to chant OM as I did in the Kings Chamber of the great pyramid of Egypt.  It then made a right turn and then at the same rate of speed it ascended at a 45 degree angle and slowly moved and dimmed into the night sky.;45.3495;-80.0297
