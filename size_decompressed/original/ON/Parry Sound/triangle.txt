Triangular shaped object / lights over Parry Sound, Ontario. Sunday Sept 1, 2002;2002-09-01 00:15:00;30 seconds;Triangular shaped object / lights over Parry Sound, Ontario. Sunday Sept 1, 2002 The object was observed while we were boating in Georgian Bay. Actual latitude and longitude can be retrieved from data stored in my GPS. We were anchored overnight near Part Rawlston ( Parry Sound ). The sky was clear and given our remote northern location ther was no interference from rural lighting. The object compared to commercial aircraft observed earlier, appeared to be at a higher altitude and was extremely large.  It consisted of three lights in a triangular shape. Not a perfect triangle but with one side shorter that the other. It travelled east to west with no sound. As it went further east the lights suddenly dimmed out and it was no longer visable. Three adults witnessed the object.;45.3495;-80.0297
