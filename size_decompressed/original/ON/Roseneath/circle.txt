This object was round and looked like an orange if you slice it from top to bottom(not cross ways). It had two halves,divided by light ( I never saw them separate though)and it had a glow around it, not really a glow, there just seemed to me to be no sharp edge. The whole unit glowed light orange.Each halves (as I looked through Binoculars) apeared to have tubes that slightly resembled viens running along them. We got the call from a neighbor down the street to check out our back door and see what was out there. We all went out(8 of us) looked south and saw it perfectly still in the sky. (remember it is 5pm and it is still light out!!! We stood there watching it till we got cold(mid november)then everyone went in the house, I grabbed a coat and went back outside,but it was gone, I was so disappointed!!!;44.1881;-78.0547
