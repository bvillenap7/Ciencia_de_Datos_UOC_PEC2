1 craft seemed to steal earths energy to power up its craft.;2009-06-24 01:00:00;30 minutes;1 craft seemed to steal earths energy to power up its craft. It was a starry night, no clouds, no haze. One single circular light sped through the sky, and after awhile became very dim. As soon as the craft went dim, our power went out and the craft then became VERY bright. It then zoomed through the sky and eventually went out of sight. There were then 2 crafts moving parallel to each other very quickly.  The crafts were blinking at each other on and off, and then they eventually disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain as to whether this is intended as a serious-minded report, although it has all of the hallmarks that we traditionally, associate with a good report.  Can anyone in the vicinity of Wiarton, Canada, confirm the power outage?  PD));44.7333;-81.128
