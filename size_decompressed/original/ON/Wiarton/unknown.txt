Colpoys Bay possible ufo sighting!;2021-02-23 20:15:00;Clear skies;Colpoys Bay possible ufo sighting! It’s a clear sky with the moon half full clear as day with many visible stars. I know it can not be a plane because one went by and I have stood here for 10 minutes. I saw a bigger flash of orange around the star so I thought it was but it dimmed down that’s how I noticed it. It’s moving side to side and up and down in a circular motion. It’s a bright light that I thought was a star at first but is moving leaving a small trail of light that fades away. I took an amazing pair of binoculars with my father out to see if I was right. You can see the moons forms with them. I was still and it moved out of my view with them. There is no way it’s a star, plan or satellite as it was not moving in one direction across the sky. I just checked again before submitting this and it’s moved to the left even more! This is crazy. Someone has to tell me they saw this too!;44.7333;-81.128
