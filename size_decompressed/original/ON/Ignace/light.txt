A long line of lights flying in single file heading north.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-20 05:05:00;10-15 minutes;A long line of lights flying in single file heading north 30 km west of ignace Ontario.  My bf and I stopped to take a stretch from our drive.  He happened to ear something and glanced around to notice a light moving then soon followed the long line of lights in the  dark morning sky.  Wondering if he was seeing things, he quickly told me to look at the sky.  I was shocked and freaked out ..  I managed to catch the last 25plus lights fly in a line headed north;49.4201;-91.6632
