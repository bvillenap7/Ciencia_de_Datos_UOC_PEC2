It was a very dark night low cloud cover w/light rain. I saw two large circular emerald - green lights from my third floor apartment window and jumped up to see.  The centres of these lights were white.  There was a 10 storey building approximately 1000 feet directly across the road from my location and since the object was between me and it, I estimate the elevation to have been 500 - 800 feet at a distance of 150 yards. Also these lights would have been about 15 - 20 feet apart and attached to the same object (which I couldn't make out). This object was motionless then I watched it zoomed off in level flight and in a straight line. (Approximately 4 seconds) This event position was at 45deg 43.23min North: 77deg 41min West. Direction of travel WNW 270deg magnetic + 12deg Var =282deg (I'm a private pilot) Conditiond were VFR (Visual flight rules) so visibility would have been not more than 7 nautical miles.  Since the object vanished into a pin point in 4 sec that would make the approximate ground speed to be 9,450 Mph. I notified the Military Police at CFB Petawawa (Where it would pass to the south) and reported the event. I also called the local Police to report the sighting. Monday, July 10/00 I called the Army Base again to confirm my call...it was not logged in and they said they didn't know anything about the incident! I've just kept this to myself since that day.;45.749237037037;-77.2012851851853
