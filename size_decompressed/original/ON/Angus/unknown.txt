The sky was so clear that we could see numerous stars.  Expect there were verticle rays of light, similar to when the sun shines through clouds during the day. These rays were vertically rippling.  When we pulled over they seemed to condense.  We decided to leave (quickly) we pulled over about 1/2hour later and the condensed light seem to still be to the right side of the car.  We when home.  When we got out of the car it was over head.  I got the camera but could not get a picture (wouldn't work), then I got the video camera (would work outside).  My wife took one picture of me looking up when developed two balls of light are above and to the left of my head.  The second picture she took, you can see one of the lights, speeding up going over and around my head and then slowing down and moving to my right ear.  You see the start point and stop point as well as a bright green trail of movement it took.  The trail of movement clearly shows the light speed up /////  /   /   / /  /  /   /   / / ////// and slow down in a curved path.  The second light does a motion left turns right ///// /  /   /   /     /  and is gone.  What scares me is that these are two very organised recognisable paths that these white light took and then one was gone and one is seen beside my ear in the split second that it takes to get a picture.  Our camera would not work shooting upward but did work at a face to face type level.  Behind me is nothing but, forest, which can not be seen in the picture because it was dark (with the exception of the sky).  Off in the distance that night we also saw a verticle bright beem of light going strait up into the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the individuals witnessed, but we feel that a laser-based advertising light would have to be ruled out.  They are quite similar in appearance to what the witness has described, but we do not know whether Angus, Ontario, is a populated enough area to warrant the use of dramatic advertising lights.  Moreover, we would not expect an advertising light to be used at 0300 hrs.., since they are very expensive to operate.  PD));44.3273;-80.0364
