bright orange star is stationary, when witnessed by 2nd person it fades and moves away.  3rd time this season;2007-10-20 20:45:00;3 seconds;bright orange star is stationary, when witnessed by 2nd person it fades and moves away.  3rd time this season I noticed a strange looking orange star.  I thought it was the planet Mars but it's usually on the other side of the sky.  It was brighter then other stars and stationary.  I was standing outside with my wife and told her that star was oddly bright so we both looked at it.  A few seconds later it began fading and started moving slowly away and finally vanished.  It seemed as if it knew we noticed it and left its stationary position.  This was no satellite.  This is the 3rd time we've seen this kinda of activity over our skies.;50.0754;-91.955
