Bright light shooting through the sky with no sound.;2013-08-22 23:30:00;2 minutes;Bright light shooting through the sky with no sound. We were location scouting for a film project on the Sagamok First Nation near Massey, ONT, Canada.   Later that night, while relaxing by a fire at my partners cabins, I looked up and seen a big bright light streaming across the sky.  I grabbed my video camera and managed to capture 2 minutes of something.  It was filmed with my Sony HDR-HC3 camera with a wide angle lens.   This experience has left us wondering what is it that is on the video.  No flashing lights like a plane.;46.201;-82.0833
