Large Black Triangle;2003-08-26 23:00:00;??;Large Black Triangle I am from Welland but when my family went camping in Fonthill, my brother pointed out something strange in the sky. I am not sure if it was a ufo or not. It was hard to see because it was black, but if you looked closely in the sky you could see a large, dark triangle, darker than the sky, with shining white lights that looked like big stars at each point.;43.034;-79.2783
