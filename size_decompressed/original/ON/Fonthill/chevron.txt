Three Pyramid shaped vertical lines that were just above tree height near the lake where I was passing;2010-06-19 22:05:00;17 minutes;Three Pyramid shaped vertical lines that were just above tree height near the lake where I was passing I was driving in the slow lane from Fonthill to St.Catharines at approximately 100kms per hour, the three lights appeared in the shape of a pyramid and appeared to be three vertical lines...my windows were down completely and there was no sound that I could hear from the objects...they were just above the tree line as I drove past Gibson lake and seemed to be a few kilometres away, with my arm held at arms length and my thumb raised the two objects at the bottom were about the width of my thumb at the first joint andthe third line was alsmost at the top of my thumb.  at 22:14 while viewing the objects I attempted to call my girlfriend to tell her about this and could not get through to her...I have a record to prove this....this object or objects seemed to follow me for the entire period..these objects looked to be travelling low and were thicker lines NOT roundâ€¦ Thanks  At times they were almost stationary.;43.034;-79.2783
