I was young at the time i approximate 8 years old, i was awoken by a flash of light at my window, i sat up in be, reached over to the window, peeked through the blinds, and saw what i thought at the time to look like an orange street light moving left to right, left to right, over the houses behind my property, this went on for a minute or so, then it disappeared, i laid back down in bed, then i heard my closet door squeaking as it opened, i looked, and coming out of my closet was a 3-4 foot tall being, which i have now been able to identify as a grey and he was looking at me, i hid under my blanket, and tried to scream, but nothing came out, i then blacked out, i remembered only the feeling of something sharp on the back of my neck when i awoke, i immediately went down stairs and asked my foster mother if i had a mark on the back of my neck, she said no, asked me why i asked, i said i think i was abducted by aliens she told me it mus! t have been a dream, because there was no mark on my neck, i accepted her dream idea, and moved on, then when this growth on the back of my neck began, in that exact same location, i began to investigate further, and i realized what i had gone had been seen before, the descriptions i had read matched my memories perfectly, since then, i have thoroughly investigated the phenomenon, and just found this site tonight, after another encounter which i reported 1st.
