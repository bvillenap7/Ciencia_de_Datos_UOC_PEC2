Silent orange lights.;2012-08-19 21:05:00;1:00;silent orange lights looked out my window at around 9:05 this evening to see if my daughter had pulled in the driveway when I noticed 2 orange lights moving slowly overhead.  There was absolutly no noise.  Thought maybe it was parachuters but not this time of night. Went on the deck and they disappeared over the trees next door.  Threw on my shoes and went into the driveway just to see another orange light passing over again, went out to road and followed it as it went south toward the golf coarse and it disappeared.  Told my neighbour about it hoping someone else in the area saw it as well so she could verify it with others that I wasn't crazy?!?!?!

It would slow down then speed up a bit then changed directions and headed south and disappeared.   My husband witnessed this with me.   Within 10 minutes another red/orange light moved across the same spot!!  It was not blinking like a plane or helicopter, and there was absolutely NO sound!!  It did the same flight path and disappeared again.   My husband took a video with his Blackberry phone but it doesn't show the colour. On 8/19/2012 21:05 I witnessed 2 red/orange lights following each other in the exact same spot!!  Any explaination???  This time I had someone with me to witness this strange occurance.
