At a distance of about 1 mile away and at least about 300-400 feet above the treetop line, just true north of our house this object was slowly moving on an westerly direction. It resembled an upside down funnel, rounded on the edges and the top of the funnel was rounded also. Looking at this it had 3 eggshaped oblisques attached to the bottom of the cone evenly spaced apart and rotating at different intervals. As they rotated they went from a bright yellow to a sharp orange. The main vessel consistently stayed at a bright yellow. My wife who also observed this, very quickly layed back down in bed and quite frankly told me that she did not want to talk about this at all. Our vision is good and this was no plane or helicopter or weather balloon.;44.7901;-75.38
