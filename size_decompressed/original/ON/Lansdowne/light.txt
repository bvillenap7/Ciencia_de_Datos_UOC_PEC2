A straight line of non-blinking single lights.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-17 19:00:00;10 minutes;My husband called me outside to see something he thought strange, so I came out to see a straight line of non-blinking single lights moving in a straight line across the sky but as we watched them go across the sky,all disappeared, one by one, at a certain point in the sky, so after it stopped, we looked around for more and we could see only a few others spaced apart along the western horizon like some sort of perimeter.;44.4085;-76.0127
