I also have to tell you something else....I have 5 people who can be my witness....I used to live in an isolated cabin in the woods of;1997-08-02 02:30:00;35 seconds;I also have to tell you something else....I have 5 people who can be my witness....I used to live in an isolated cabin in the woods of Ontario. Just me and my 2 dogs....no phone...all electricity was from batteries and generaters,I lived a simple life,in 1997,aug,at around 2am.I turned of the generater at my home,and yelled for my dogs,to come in the house,and  I heard a man scream at the top of his lungsoh my god somebody help me: followed by a 5 second scream,Somebody help me   then silence.....It was only maybe 1000 feet from my home,at the edge of the neighbours bushline. My dogs ran in the house,unable to hear this scream???that is strange too...my dogs bark at anything that is not me.....the scream terrified me soo much,I was tio scared towalk along the pitch black laneway to my truck......Came morning I told my brothers,asked them what I should do,we all came to the conclusion,if the dogs didnt hear it,mabe it was something else???ghost perhaps????so i watched the papers and ther news...no missing anybody...... And besides last time I called the local [police ,I reported 5 armed hunters,trespassing on my property,they walked right by my kitchen widow,with shotguns......I called the police,they put me on hold,then hung up on me. I dont know what happened in that bush....but i know what i heard....and this was in 1997. Not soon after...I had 2 men on quad-runners...watching my home,from a newly mad trail into our bush. They would leave everynight,after I went to bed...But i was listening to them ride away from wy window....This went on for 2 years.....I have had many ufo/sighings since....but not juring that night of the screams.... I have witnesses that can varify this. This is why I am interested in the very similar story with the screaming woman/ufo story....I think the same thing happed to this unidentified man,in 1997.....which strangely nowbody seems to miss?????????whoever,or whatever that was i heard. I still have nightmares of his screams..... I moved from my home 2 years later...never to return there again..... take care God Bless us all... ((website address deleted)) This is not a joke.
