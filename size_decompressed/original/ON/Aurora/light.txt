Bright light in cloudy sky, vanishes in the blue night sky;2005-08-15 21:15:00;3 mins;Bright light in cloudy sky, vanishes in the blue night sky I was outside on my porch one evening, it was partily cloudy, clouds were moving quickly over the sky.  As I looked up I notitced a bright light, at first glance I thought it was one of those spot lights. I knew it was not an airplane, I see airplanes in our area all the time, and this was forsure not an airplane or helicopter.  I could only see the light when in was in the clouds, when the light moved to the blue sky it vanished. Then I thought, well maybe it was someone down below shining a light in the sky, but saw no beam. The light travelled very fast, up, down around, left and right, sharp movements. It would disappear into the sky, then resurface in the clouds. It was an orb shape, not circle, nor not like a tear shape.  Very strange, I have never seen a ghost or a space craft in my life, I was amazed.   Could this be a alien?  Or a gosht?  Or was it something else?  I have no clue, this was the second encounter. The first one did last as long, but the light split into two and vansihed into the night sky. The area we live in a a new development, not much around but land. Not sure what I saw, but it would be intresting to see if others had seen the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));43.9982;-79.4624999999999
