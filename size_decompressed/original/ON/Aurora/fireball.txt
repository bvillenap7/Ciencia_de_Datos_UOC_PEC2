Each light seemed to be a different size and a different shade of orange, almost strengthening and weakening in color and it looked like they were shimmering, like a glowing, burning ember from a bon-fire as it rises from the flames. They seemed to be at different altitudes and each at different distances away.  There was not a sound in the sky and it was very clear as numerous stars could seen.  Even with the motion detector lights on from the rear of the yard, the street lights and the lights of the City, it didn't seem to matter - these three objects were very clear.  As they moved north-north-west, they slowly changed direction and started going north-north-east.  I watched with three other people as they all, one by one, just disappeared.;43.9982;-79.4624999999999
