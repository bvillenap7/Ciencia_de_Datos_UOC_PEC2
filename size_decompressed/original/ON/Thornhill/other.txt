Bright light splitting to 3 lights blitzing.;2002-01-11 19:00:00;20 - 60 seconds;Bright light splitting to 3 lights blitzing. Me and my wife were in my porch, when she told me to come quickely. Then i saw her looking up in the sky, i looked up to see what she was looking at. I then saw a bright orange circle suddenly, very quickely, it splited into 3 other circles. The three Circles sort of floated in the air, suddenly one of them blitzed to the left, and left a bright tail. around 3 seconds later, the other two circles blitzed, but to the other side, one, a little farther then the other. The buildings blocked us from seeing any further. It was something I've never seen. Very interesting.;43.8149537190082;-79.4313429752067
