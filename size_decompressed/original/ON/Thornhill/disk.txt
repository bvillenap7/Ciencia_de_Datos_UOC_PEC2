When we got out of the car, we witnessed a green disk with a pulsing red light move through the sky irradically, it would quickly change direction, stop and hover for a moment continue moving and changing directions and height before disappearing out of sight above the roof tops across the street.  There were planes flying by as well, the green object was moving in a way we have never seen before.;43.8149537190082;-79.4313429752067
