Single white flash of light moving in the sky.;2007-06-17 01:00:00;around 5-10 minutes;Single white flash of light moving in the sky. My boyfriend and I went outside for a smoke shortly after 1am.  We notice this light that would flash at different area low in the sky just like a firefly would do.  I really didn't think much about it but my boyfriend keeped on looking at it flashing here and there noticing that it was appearing higher in the sky. He got me back interested into it, and we fallowed the flash for a good 5 minutes.  The light would flash once at one place then two second later would flash at another location just as if we fallowed a single firefly in the sky.;49.7833;-86.55
