When my cousin ((name #2 deleted)) decided to take the snowmobile to the side of the shore and cut some fire wood, I stayed back and prepared the fishing holes. When out of nowhere my cousin returned flying on his snomomobile as fast as I ever seen him drive, Yelling at me shaking, and his face red and speachless.  ''((name #1 deleted)) he said we got to get the hell out of here, I just seen something I couldn`t believe. what? I replied.. He said he heard strange noises almost like a language but  very difficult to make out.  He walked towards the noise and suddenly seen an abandoned cabin with a weird formed object  almost like one frisbee on top of the other, with a strange almost violet light glowing out reflecting on the cabin,thats when ((name deleted))  retured to tell me what he seen and that we had to leave, but i was curious what he was talking about,  so we hurried back to the cabin  and their it was just like he discribed as we hid behined a tree, two strange human looking creatures taller than  any human ive ever seen, were walking in and out of the cabin bringing objects into the ship and suddenly they went inside their ship and boom suddenly it was gone it disapeared.  Me and ((name deleted)) went to get a closer look where the ship was situated a huge blast crader in the ground. We waited to see if it would return but it never returned.;49.7833;-86.55
