Eight lights travelled at seemingly exactly the same distance apart without sound;2013-08-09 22:00:00;10 minutes;Eight lights travelled at seemingly exactly the same distance apart without sound Around August 9, 2013, (about 2 weeks ago,) I was traveling on highway 25 through Acton Ontario,   I saw 9 lights rising in the late evening (after 9 pm) sky. Not understanding what I was seeing, I pointed it out to two passer-bys who where also stumped as to what we were looking at.  Then, I walked up to a parked truck in a local tiny mall and asked the fella inside what he thought those were. He said oh those are probably hot-air balloons.  I asked if there was a hot-air field or club around and ...do they fly at night?  He didn't know the answers. I asked if those balloons fly into the clouds?  (because one did)  He didn't know.   The later eight lights slowly followed the direction of the one that rose above the clouds, but not at the same speed and not into the clouds either.  Rather, they stayed communal at an even slower pace at very similar distances apart from each other.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
