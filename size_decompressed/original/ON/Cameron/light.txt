7 fast lights moving at 700+ mi/ hr, between 60000- 90000 ft;2007-06-04 23:00:00;7-9 minutes;7 fast lights moving at 700+ mi/ hr, between 60000- 90000 ft At my family's farm, 35 minutes north of Lindsay, ON:  First light passed by in the sky about 75 degrees up, at least 60000 ft ++, travelling NE.  From what I have deduced, it was travelling at approximately 700 mi/ hour.  I simply brushed it off as a satelite.  Clear sky, no extreme light poluting the sky (save for the very dim hue coming from Lindsay). As I sat, I began to see others at varying degrees, between 45 and 75, and travelling at similar speeds and at heights between 60000- 90000 ft.  Two of them appeared to slow down (close to what appeared to be a stop) only to speed up again to 700- 800 mi/ hr. Each different light event produced yellow/ orange/ red and blue/ purple. Although consciously I continue to shrug this off as a satelite event, something tells me it was not.  I have spent many summer nights watching the consistencies of satelite activity.  This was not consistent. I would love to know if anyone else witnessed this or if there was an event that you at NUFORC know about. No camera as I was decidedly roughing it. Thanks!;44.3272;-78.0972
