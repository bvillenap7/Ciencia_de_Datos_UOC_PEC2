As it appeared I thought in my head what the heck?, and I was sort of mesmerized by it, I thought it's too low to be a satellite , it has no wings, it had lights that blinked left to right , white, blue, red possibly green then white again .. The blinking stopped then started again at the left , at that time I realised the lights were blinking around the back of it.  The sun was reflecting off the top and made it look white then the row of rectangle lights , then the under side was a slightly dark grey colour .  I seen it heading towards another white cloud and at that time I finally snapped out of being mesmerized and ran into my apartment to grab binoculars only to get back out just before it disappeared behind a greyish colour cloud with a ! poody smaller white cloud .  The grey cloud was barely visible I expected the white cloud to be where I couldn't see it but it started to fade out with the grey cloud .  Fir the next couple days I was repeatedly going outside hoping to see it again .  I mentioned it to a couple people who didn't seem interested and I didn't say nothing but now I'm kind of freaked out about it.  Mainly because I did seem mesmerized by it.  It looked like any typical flying saucer , it was moving slow and it didn't look huge to me or no higher then a small sight seeing airplane would fly. Anyways I don't want to see it again !  Wild guessing I'm gonna say it was approx 30ft from one end to the other ? Also it made no sound at all or left any exhaust , ((name deleted));44.5698000000001;-80.9439000000002
