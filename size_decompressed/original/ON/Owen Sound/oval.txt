After maybe 20 seconds, raced to directly overhead - that took an additional 15-25 seconds.   Once overhead, it split into two equal shapes, but not identical.  Both were very bright and moving very slowly in a tight formation overhead for maybe 20 additional seconds.  Then, in a flash, they both streaked right into the southern horizon.  Before heading south they moved in a hurky jerky fashion making 90 degree turns quickly and easily.  There was no sound associated with the sighting.   I am a retired pilot 66 years old with many years flying various draft in the Canadian North and Arctic.  My friend and I were on a rooftop, were both speechless for a long time.  I don't know about my friend but I have never told anyone about this....don't really know why.   Thanks!;44.5698000000001;-80.9439000000002
