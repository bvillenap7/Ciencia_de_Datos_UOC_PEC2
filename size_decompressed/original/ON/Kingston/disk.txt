close  really close;1987-01-29 03:00:00;10-15 min;close  really close was driven home after a night of driving taxi... 2:30-2:45 am in late January early Feb.in 1986 or 87 ...was coldest day/night  of that winter -30c .and clear skies no wind...stars were so bright ....I get out of cab ..and start walking back to the side door ..to get to my appt..have my face buried in my coat ...using my breath ..to keep my face warm ...as I'm walking ..I hear a jet engine ...I look up don't see anything ..put my head down ..pickup the pace ..I still hear the jet sound ..look up again ..and see a red light ..confirms to me a jet ...head down ..I'm freezing ...almost to the door ..then something comes over me ..that red light isn't flying fast enough to fly...stop dead in my tracks look again ..I see red light and a white light like a head light ..I can only see the beam from the white light... and it lights up about 50 feet in front so bright you could see the moisture in the air...still I couldn't make out any shape of this craft ...all of a sudden the street lights lite it up ..I see round disk less than 200 yards away ...and less than a 100 feet off the ground and at the same time ...all I can hear is the engine revving up and sounded exactly like a jet turbine ...it would spool up for about 20 seconds then a couple of clanking noises..like some sorta relieve valve... then spool down and then start all over again ... as it moved at snails pace in front of me ...I have a excellent side view of it ..disk shaped looks like a child's top ..with the red light right on the bottom ...now the details that are forever burned into my head ...easily 50-60 feet in diameter and the same in height.. I can see some sorta of exhaust gases coming out under the disk part ..and  slowly float/drift behind it ...as it slowly moves from my left to right [I'm looking south ..it's moving from SE to NW]..I can now see the back of it ..there are 2 pod like things on the top of the top shaped craft ..that cover about 1/4 of the disk and are about 10-15 feet high ..on the back and sticking out t! he back on both pods are 3 jet fighter like exhaust ...in a step formation and they are at 3 different angles ...with the bottom ones sticking out past the disk... a few feet and are straight out level ...but the other 2 are at 2 different angles... In the  middle of the pod [side view] there is 2 white seamless tubes that ran to some sort of array or something ..I'm  guessing it was some kind of intake,, all I could see was vapor ...these tubes ran from there to the deck on top of the disk about 20 feet high ...which had a dome like structure on top of it another 10 feet or so  ..where I seen the white light coming from ...the outer shell of the craft... was one of the most interesting things ...it was like hardwood flooring tongue and groove ..thin strip of some burnt looking metallic material..I could see no welds...It was one thing too see ..and it was another to feel it ...it was really loud ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Three campers and myself witnessed three disk or saucer shaped multicolur emitting objects hovering in the night nky.;2000-07-25 01:30:00;2hr;Three campers and myself witnessed three disk or saucer shaped multicolur emitting objects hovering in the night nky. Four campers spot three strange objects: 30 min. drive north of Kingston.  Objects were saucer shaped, hovering erratically (like an insect or kite) inclined at roughly a 30 degree angle.  The bottom of each u.f.o. was brightly lit with a white light.  The top or back of each object was adorned with different coloured lights: red dominating the center in a line, and blue at the tips accompanied by shades of yellow and green.  The lights would pulse in a seemingly random order, with the red lights flashing in syncronisation, or one at a time.  At times, an object would assume a smooth regular flight path to commence hovering at a new location.  Ascention and descention were rapid, and at equal velocities.  These objects were visible for approx. 2 hours, and made no audible sound.  It is probably worth mentioning that there was an unusually large meteor shower that night (1:30 a.m., July 25, 2000).;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
