Took my binoculars looking straight up. I saw the biggest craft outside of our atmosphere.  The moon was lit, but there was no shine at all . It looked stealth color and huge. Moving fast across the sky south to north.  Ive seen alot of unexplained but this one gave me a chill.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
