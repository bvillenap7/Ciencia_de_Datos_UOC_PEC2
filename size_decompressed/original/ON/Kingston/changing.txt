It moved to fast and had no sound.;2002-02-15 19:00:00;8-10 seconds;It moved to fast and had no sound. I was sitting on the window sill cleaning the outside glass when a bright object caught my eye. Being half in and half out, of the upstairs window, I had a 180 degree view of due south facing the St. Laurence River. The sky ceiling was about 10,000 feet, but I may be off on that. My first thought was ‘man he’s fling really low!’, but when I considered how fast it was moving and how bright it was I then thought ‘holly crap that’s moving fast!’. Having lived for many years less than a quarter mile from a Canadian Air Force landing strip (Trenton Ontario) and witness to many many night time flights of craft of all sorts I knew the sight of running lights and the sounds they made. I also know what a plane/jet looks like when the sun is beyond the horizon and reflecting on it and running lights. More over I know the sound. This thing had no sound from the moment I first saw it to well after it passed from the point where I could see it (I went out doors to find it again). Simply put, an unusually clean white coloured craft less than a quarter inch in size (to my eyes) flew a full 180 degrees across my field of view in less than 10 seconds. I have never seen anything move that fast, move in a perfectly straight line and make no sound...non at all. This is only the second time I have shared this and I’m doing this because of what you said on the coast to coast program. I’m a mature person and was in my mid to late 30’s when I saw what I saw. It left such an impression on me that I think about it more often then I would like. Regards,;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
an object with a white light at the front and up to 6 red and white lights on the back was moving across the sky;2005-11-06 19:17:00;90 seconds;an object with a white light at the front and up to 6 red and white lights on the back was moving across the sky at first it seemed like it was a plane, but after a few seconds we knew it was moving to fast. in the past we've seen many sightings.  the object had one white light at the front of it, 3 red lights at the back of it, and two other white lights at the back as well... the lights were formed as a triangle in the sky as a airplane would appear.... it was moving quite fast and was definately at least 3-5 times the size of a large airplane... we saw it in the sky from inside my apartment and then we went out on my balcony, it started to turn and as it turns it was noticeably a shaped as a circle/saucer... it was the craziest thing we have ever seen... the two of us have seen other events in the past and finally seeing this convinced me to notify someone, we are both really interested in learning more about this... i would like for someone to contact me and send me information on other sightings, etc...;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
