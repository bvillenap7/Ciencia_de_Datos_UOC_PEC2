Multi-coloured large UFO seen low on horizon, Ontario, 1988;1988-08-15 20:00:00;3 hours;Multi-coloured large UFO seen low on horizon, Ontario, 1988 Hi there,  I am sorry to duplicate this story but I called this in to Brian Vike approx. 6 years ago and I got some closure from it.  He was amazing to talk with.  However, as a regular Rense listener for about 8 years, I recently heard some interviews that resonated with me....with detail that I too experienced.  I would love to talk with you.  I am 38 years old and I swear my memory is etched in me like yesterday.  Yet, I live in Ontario.  I would love to explain my youthful mind and brain and share what I have never, ever been able to shake off of me.   I had the most incredible August evening, along with two others, that we have since rarely ever spoken about.  It was incredible. So many hours, so many crafts....so many different coloured lights...different shapes and speeds of crafts.  After all these years of remembering and reading and researching,  I honestly think there was some mind control going on. I would love to share my story with you.   Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in 1988 is approximate.  We have encouraged the witness to submit a detailed report.  PD));44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
Bright red oval shaped object with blurred edges rapidly crossed the night sky from east to west.;2007-08-16 23:15:00;8-9 sec;Bright red oval shaped object with blurred edges rapidly crossed the night sky from east to west. A strange red oval shape which was somewhat blurry around the edges, travelled in a straight trajectory from east to west at 2315hrs.  The object moved very quickly in the direct opposite direction of the 5 or 7 satelites we had previously observed that night.  The object completely crossed the sky in about 8-9 seconds leaving no visible trail behind it.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495

Ufo spotted in photo over Lake Ontario.;2015-06-14 13:33:00;Unknown;Ufo spotted in photo over Lake Ontario I was going through some photos I had taken on June 14, 2015, and in one photo, I noticed something in the sky.  I don't remember taking a specific photo of this object as I was just snapping photos while out with my girlfriend and her dog.  I never saw the object in the sky, until I looked at the photo and noticed it.  I zoomed the photo and used an edge detection filter on the image and realized it wasn't a bird or anything else I could ascertain.  I came to the conclusion that it was indeed an unidentified flying object.  It is definitely a solid object in the sky above the lake.  I also snapped another picture of the same scene about 17 seconds later and the object doesn't appear in the second photo.  I am submitting these two photos and I haven't changed them in any way.  These are directly from the camera to my hard drive.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
