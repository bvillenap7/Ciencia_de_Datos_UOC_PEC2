hovering craft;1994-07-10 21:30:00;5 mins;hovering craft I was attending this summer camp on a lake about 1hr away from Kingston on highway 38, from 1991-1995 every summer from July to mid August. In the summer of 1994, there were several nights in which I alone, and once with friends saw. There was even one broad daylight sighting. One night we were heading back to our cabins at about 9:30 pm. There was never any planes around. We saw this round object hovering above the other side of the lake. Sometimes there would be a dark orange light on it for more than a minute, and then it would disappear while still being able to see the outline of the craft moving. Several nights later close to 22:00, we were at this building called the rec hall where we'd hand out. I went outside alone for some air. On the right side of the building on the grass there was this dark orange light in the shape of a large rectangle shining on the grass. At first I thought it was a light shining through the window. I walked nearby it and it would've been impossible for a rectangle that big to be shining through a window that small and covered with wired mesh. I then looked around and didn't see anything until I looked up into the sky and saw this round object with the same coloured light on it as that of the rectangle on the grass. I then ran back inside being affraid of being abducted. Towards the end of the summer myself and another counsellor and a couple of kids saw in broad daylight, a round silver metallic object with no sharp edges and no sound flying over the baseball field ( near the rechall). They were in shock, as was I. I saw this same object, with the same coloured light over several other nights while I was there. I saw the same thing a few times the summer before in 1993 at the same camp. I have always been a strong believer in UFO's and other planet life. I also strongly believe the government is in fact holding some sort of UFO technology and maybe life somewhere. Probably not at AREA 51 because it too well known. I truly believe there is a big conspiracy to keep aliens/UFO's quiet. All the way from Rosewell to the year 2002. I saw once on tv about UFO's, they showed the drawing of a craft that was describe by a WW2 pilot they saw, to the US Stealth Bomber. The shape and size was very similar. They also believe the Stealth Bomber came from UFO technology. Brief summary, I'm not stupid, I know what I've seen, and I know what's out there. Thank you for your time and I hope to receive an E-mail from you soon! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495

Green fireball spotted between Toronto and Kingston Ontario Canada Dec. 20/2000 -- 8:38 PM EST.;2000-12-20 20:38:00;2-4 seconds;Green fireball spotted between Toronto and Kingston Ontario Canada Dec. 20/2000 -- 8:38 PM EST. On Dec. 20/2000 at 8:38 PM EST, I was driving north on HWY #38 -- which runs directly north of the eastern end of Lake Ontario. I looked to my left (West) and saw a bright green ball of light descending straight down. Gold/yellow sparks seemed to be coming from the object. I was visible for only a couple of seconds. As well, it was extremely bright. The evening was exceptionally clear with no moon. My best guess is that the object would have been about 50 miles from me. This would raise the possibility of other reports being files from teh Belleville area as well as perhaps Trenton and Oshawa. If my guess with respect to distance is off, perhaps there might be some reports from Toronto. I watch the sky a great deal and have not seen an object of this nature before. The color and path of descent are the two issues which have compelled me to file this report. Best regards, ((name deleted));44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
Circular silent light descending in a half circle from approximately 5-thousand feet through to 4500 feet in a cloudless, evening sky.;2012-07-06 23:45:00;5 seconds;Circular silent light descending in a half circle from approximately 5-thousand feet through to 4500 feet in a cloudless, evening sky. During the evening of July 6 2012, I witnessed a bright, noiseless object descend from approximately 5-thousand feet in a tight, half circle pattern, to approximately 4500 feet.  This sighting took place due south of Kingston, Ontario Canada.  It lasted 5-seconds. When I asked several potential witnesses standing in close proximity to me if they had seen the object, they said they had not as they were chatting.  I also suspect some of the group would have had their view blocked by an overhanging canopy from the entrance of the commercial establishment.  I was sitting on a knee wall at the outer perimeter of the canopy. The object, while descending, went from a starlight intensity (over the course of a second or so) to extremely bright (for 3 seconds or so) then back to its original intensity and blinked out. This occurred as the object arced through a half circle pattern away from my location, and seemingly on a 45 degree angle downward. The best I can describe the object would be several times larger than Venus and many times its brightness.  I failed to call out to anyone in close proximity to me simply because I was utterly spellbound by the object. The sky, where the object appeared, was cloudless.  I could see several stars behind where the light had been once it blinked out. The distance south to Lake Ontario from my location has since been calculated to be a mile. The object appeared at a 1 O'clock position (about 70 degrees) from my point of observation. I believe the object was midpoint between myself and the lake.

2 Suns? Comet?;2013-11-28 14:00:00;5 minutes;2 Suns? Comet? As I was driving home down hwy 15 (south) it appeared I was driving towards 2 sunsets.  The one to the right was clearly the sun (west) but what was the sun type object in front of me? ((NUFORC Note:  Looks like a reflection off of a broad swath of clouds.

Star-like round object hovers for 20 minutes, then takes off crazy fast.;2015-03-12 21:30:00;40 minutes;Star-like round object hovers for 20 minutes, then takes off crazy fast. I went outside to go to my car and saw what looked like a very odd, low-hanging star in the distance.  All the stars were out, but this one looked very yellow and seemed to be flickering.  I stared at it for about 20 minutes and it appeared to be hovering in place. A plane passed nearby, and this looked nothing like the plane whatsoever.  I've also seen helicopters, chinese lanterns, swamp gas and the northern lights before.  This was nothing at all like any of those.  I was staring and staring, totally mesmerized.  I decided to run inside for a minute to grab my phone.  I doubted that I could get a good picture as the object was so far away and it was very dark, but I was going to try.  I also tweeted out to people on twitter about it, to see if anyone else in my city could see the bright light and if they knew what it might be.  When I came back out, I was watching it for maybe 30 seconds and then the light went red.  About 30 seconds later, it became a very bright white light, and then TOOK OFF.  It took off FAST. Way faster than I had just seen the plane go.  And I mean, WAY, WAYYYYYY faster.  It almost seemed at this point as if there were multiple white lights, or kind of like if the object was round and had a bunch of white lights on the bottom in a circle, or if the lights were all around it on the side, and like those lights were rotating extremely fast while the object took off both vertically and horizontally.  The lights faded very fast though as the object took off.  I looked at the stars again, and they were all just as visible as before.  The entire incident took about 30-40 minutes.  I think I'm the only one in my city (relatively small) who happened to be outside in the cold weather and looking up at this exact time.  It was between 9:30pm to 10:12pm.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
