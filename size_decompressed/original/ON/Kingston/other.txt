We were siting with friends on their patio when I looked up and saw what appeared to be a star heading off just off the tip of the top ;1998-07-18 23:22:00;10seconds approx;We were siting with friends on their patio when I looked up and saw what appeared to be a star heading off just off the tip of the top star at the top cup of the big dipper it ran from there to right above me in about 7 - 10 seconds then appearred to fizzle out. It could of been falling star but I've never seen one last as long or appear to waver a bit as it went. If you have an explanation as to what this might have been I would like to hear from you. It covered an arc from my chair to when it went out of about 125 degrees if you were to follow with your arm in about 7 seconds, not like a falling star as there usually much quicker and don't waver like this did. As above three witnesses, all wondering what we saw I didn't count my characters above so I hope you got it all.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Boomerang in shape.;2003-07-24 23:10:00;approx: 20 seconds;Toll Free Hotline.  A witness called today from Ontario to make a report of a sighting he and his wife had witnessed. The husband and wife had just got back from their son's ball game, his son had caught a ride home with his friends. When the couple arrived home and were going about their business, they noticed none of the telephones were working in the house. The fellow wanted to contact the phone company, but of course couldn't. He wondered if the phone in the barn might be working so he headed outside and was on his way to the barn, looking up through the Pine trees and across the highway when he saw an extremely bright white light. The witness said it was so bright that he could not even look at it without placing his hand up in front of him. At the point where he first noticed it, the light was approx: a kilometer away coming from the west and his neighbors farm.  The witness mentioned to me that after he first spotted it the first thing that popped into his head was camera. Although due to being fascinated with the object he soon forgot about the camera. He ran back up from the barn area and banged on his home's door to catch his wife's attention. When she ask what was going on, he said to her, 'you have to come out and see this.  He explained that he is not a man who gets rattled very easy, but what he had witnessed did shake it up a lot.  When the object came up close to his property it was not traveling very fast at all and had four bright white lights at the front of it and one red light in the middle, or center of the craft. He also said as bright as the lights were, they did not illuminate any of the surrounding area. He and his wife both thought it looked like a boomerang in shape. Also the fellow said it looked as if something was sticking out of the front of it. As the object left their property moving into the distance they lost sighting of the bright lights, but they did say the lights which were at the front of the craft were still lighting up the front end of it. (HBCC UFO Note: The witness said when he first saw it he thought it was landing lights on a large jet aircraft. He also wondered if it was going to crash due to it being at such a low altitude and no airport close by). There was also sound heard coming from the object. A very low rumbling sound to it, like a throbbing sound. As he pointed out, that if it was a normal aircraft and being as low as it was. The sound would have knocked his socks off due to it being very loud. But it wasn't like this at all. The object itself was dark or blackish in color. The fellow gave a guess at what the size may have been, using his home as reference of 74 feet long. He figured the distance between the first light to the second may have been roughly 70 feet in distance. So between the first light and the last the approx: distance would have been just over 200 feet. This would have been how wide the object was, or appeared to be.  Hopefully the other witnesses across the lake will talk with me over what they saw, which was the same object.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

We were standing on our front porch, when to the northeast of where i was standing, two grey lines (one above the other) approx. 1 cm. in length to the eye briskly glided to the southwest then to south direction.  The objects did not change shape or color, neither distance appart or speed.  There was no sound, no flashing lights and lasted in the sky for a time of around 30 seconds.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
bright light over city for 5minutes  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2007-04-29 22:15:00;5 minutes;bright light over city for 5minutes I looked out my second story window which is west facing and saw a light in the dark sky.  What I noticed right away was the brightness of the light. Far brighter that anything I had seen. It never moved from its postition but did fade in and out. Becoming very bright.  At first I thought it was a plane but soon realized that the light was not moving.  It stayed in the same spot for at least 5 minutes and then faded from sight.  Prehaps it was my eyes playing tricks but I swear I could see an outline of a triangle.  It looked to me like it was not far above the City and not up as high as the planes here fly.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
