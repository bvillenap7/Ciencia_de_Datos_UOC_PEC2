I saw a small bright light gliding in a circle. Within a few seconds of seeing the first light, a second light appeared and seemed to be following the first light keeping the same distance behind the first light each time is circled.  At first I thought they were two seagulls, but realized they were much too high.  I thought perhaps they were jets but two jets would not be able to fly in the way that the lights were circling.  Then the lights would disappear briefly and then reappear.  This sighting lasted for about 30 to 45 seconds.  The sky was clear and the sun was shinning brightly.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
Several unusual lights in the sky between kingston and perth.;2004-02-26 21:00:00;5 min;Several unusual lights in the sky between kingston and perth. On the drive between Perth and Kingston we witnessed several lights in the sky behaving strangly, At first we thought it was a group of air craft except they hovered in the same possition for quite some time.  And when one of them would move it was at what must have been an incredible speed for it covered quite a bit of distance very quickly.  Each light appeared to be able to move in any direction both forward back and up and down which caused us to realise that we may be seeing something unusual.  I can't say the date exactly only that it was towards the end of febuary between the 25th and the 30th. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Lightballs/orbs and strange craft seen near Kingston Ontario and caught on video;2005-11-23 19:00:00;30 minutes;Lightballs/orbs and strange craft seen near Kingston Ontario and caught on video I have a couple or University degrees,was trained and employed as a peace officer and use to dabble in astronomy as a hobby.  I consider my powers of observation very sound. As an interesting side note another person from the Kingston Ontario area also saw a noteworthy sighting around the same time, place, and date as reported on HBCCUFO.org website. My sighting was a rather complicated event but basically  my attention was drawn to the night  sky initially due to display of Northern lights. This was around 7 pm. Some minutes later I saw a very bright moving light approaching fairly quickly from the North/East which could easily be misperceived as a UFO. However this light eventually turned out to be what I believe was a conventional prop  aircraft---although one which I have never seen presenting such an intensely bright light nor such a large craft at such a low altitude. I believe it was a conventional craft as it appeared to have small blinking  red lights on the ends of both wings. Strangely it was silent until it began a banking turn and then I could hear the drone of the engines. But most noteworthy was the intense white light that must have been affixed somewhere up front. I say up front because after it banked and turned it was no longer visible but the smaller outside marker lights, as well as a couple more, were weakly seen. This intense illumination is the brightest  light I have seen in the sky besides several reentering meteors seen during meteor showers. But the quality of the light was quite different. Returned inside my house. Went back out with  video camera and observed a  patch of evenly illuminated light to the North which I took to be this prop plane which must have turned back again and then flew farther North of my position and then West while I was inside ( I surmise that but am not sure if it was the same craft). Diverted my attention and now this patch of light was due West and then much more South in what in retrospect must have been a very quick progression.  Not sure how it moved from North to South so quickly.  But I don't believe this was a UFO.  However what I caught on video next surely was. To make the story short.... After returning inside and back out again  I saw 2 light balls or orbs at about 1 km/half mile distance due North of me. They were in a line and  separated by about 30 feet and looked to be a few feet above the ground. First I took them to be lights from 2 cars--although brighter.  One had a reddish hue while the other was more white. But they started to act strangely---appearing to move slightly up or down or forwards or backwards. Then one winked out and to cut to the chase the solitary remaining orb approached to about 300 feet away and appeared to be about tree top height.  It was quite bright and was a soft yellowish white in color.  The time it took to approach and then leave was less than a minute. It is clearly discernible on tape. I never zoom the camera so its change in apparent size and luminosity shows it moved forward and then departed after some moments. I took some video a few days later of the  same daytime setting and it helps to illustrate how this light had to be floating over a farm field.  As a final note I should add that this is not the first time I have witnessed strange aerial activity.  But this is the first time I have captured it on tape. What I have observed is clear, what it is, is not. If you require more info or want video please contact me via email.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
We saw two bright yellow lights, moving very quickly, heading north in the night sky;2008-05-07 21:40:00;5 sec;We saw two bright yellow lights, moving very quickly, heading north in the night sky My husband and I were sitting on our deck, and I looked directly above me into the sky to look at the stars.  I saw two yellow lights moving very fast north.  I said to my husband Look at that what is it?.  My husband looked up and saw the two lights, they moved apart, then moved closer, became one light, and then vanished.  The whole incident lasted for no more than 5 seconds, and there was no sound.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
Huge Orb!!!!;2009-01-24 21:00:00;20 min;Huge Orb!!!! I was outside sitting on my front step which faces SW. It is cold out so I only planned on having a quick cigarette. I saw this huge bight light. It looked like it was maybe hovering above Lake Ontario/ St-Lawrence river. I thought it might be a helicopter since I live close to the Kingston Airport, but the light did not move or have any other flashing lights just a blue haze around it. I called my mom out to the step and ask her if there were any planets that would be that huge and bright and close this time of year. She informed me that she did not hear of any on the news. Sometimes they let us know if you can see them without a telescope. I came back inside and googled planets to see if there was one this big and close. There were no head lines. The closest and brightest one for this time of year was Sirius and it was so far and small and distant compared to what I saw. I thought this bizzare and went outside to look again. The light was still there. It was. same spot, not moving, no sounds of engines. Just sat there motionless. I was just turing around to go back inside because it was so cold and I took one last look. I am not shitting you when I say this light took off almost faster than my eyes could see!! I didn't know what to do, and had to sit and think about what i just saw. Unless the news says otherwise I saw a UFO. I know I did. I cannot think of any other explanation. Weather balloons don't move that fast. Nor do helicopters or any airplane I have seen or know about! Looking from where I saw on my step this thing had to have been huge! I am terrible at guessing but the light was like 3 of the lights that the jail I work in. All put together.  I don't drink or do drugs and my mom saw it too!;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
Unknown Objects Seen Over Easter Ontario_2013.;2013-09-25 09:00:00;5 minutes;Unknown Objects Seen Over Easter Ontario_2013 I was heading up to Sharbot Lake for work and pulled off of the Odessa exit to head north.  After driving up County Road 38, I saw a bright light in the sky.  Not yellow, orange or any color, just a bright light, the sun was to the east rising and this light was brighter than the sun.  This object did not move, just stayed motionless for about 5 minutes, as soon as I went to take a picture, GONE . . . nor zig zag or flicker just gone into space, as if it backed up full speed. One week later I was at home cooking super and my brother called me out to show me the same bright light that I saw, but this time two.  I live in Prince Edward County and the two bright objects my brother shows me are to the west over Toronto.  After again 5 minutes of spectating, one light just disappears, 2 minutes after the second one disappears.  After standing waiting too see if we could catch something else, military helicopters from the southeast, start towards the same direction.   Now when you see one by yourself and then a week later your brother spots two of them and shows you, same far distance in the atmosphere as if they are just poking in to observe, that's just crazy.  This second spotting happened 1-Nov-13. Now going back approximately 10 years, on the same lake (L. Ontario) we were camping and had saw a circular disk with red and yellow light hovering over Lake Ontario and then zing across West Lake. the observed UFO may I say, was flying about 500 ft. off of the ground and other people in Wellington reported seeing the same thing the next day.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
A star moving erratically.;2014-06-04 02:45:00;15+ minutes;A star moving erratically I was having a smoke out the window, which faces east, and I noticed a moving star.  At first I thought it was a satellite I could see it moving behind the spotty cloud cover at a steady pace.  But then it changed direction very suddenly.   In my field of vision it had been moving right to left, angled slightly downward, but then it swooped a bit before traveling up.  After this it seemed to move in short spurts, and from the curve of travel seemed to be headed my way.  The pace seemed to even out as it neared Cassiopeia, vaguely towards the Big Dipper and soon out of sight, the exit path less than 90 degrees above where it was coming from when I saw it.  It was definitely faster than a plane. It was giving me the creeps because it didn't fit with what I knew, so I went to turn on the computer (and make sure my shit was locked up) to reassure myself that it was a satellite.  It was still gone when I checked a half hour later. It just looked like a normal star or satellite of medium brightness, but searching for moving stars isn't turning up anything but it's a UFO, so here I am.;44.2669455149502;-76.5229634551495
