It started getting closer and closer eventually 100 feet above our heads. It was a cylinder shape with 2 black shapes inside. It looked like it was spinning really fast but there was no noise. It was there for about 30 seconds.If you do go there walk on the trail beside the water tower all the way to the back of the field there is an old tree all by itself. Thatâ€™s  where we saw it.;43.9671;-79.2422999999999
