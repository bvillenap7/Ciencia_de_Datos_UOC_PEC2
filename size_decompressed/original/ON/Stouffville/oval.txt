My friend and I were sitting in the backyard of the house we live in enjoying a fire in the chiminea.  It was dark, but we were watching the sky, as we usually did, and were enjoying the fact that we could see the clouds, even though it was dark.  I first noticed something move out of the corner of my eye.  I told my friend to look as it was something moving and it was very noticeable.  We both watched the object move across the sky, over the house, and then directly toward a neighboring house.   The object was oval in shape, resembling a balloon.  It was glowing from the inside out and moving at a consistent, steady pace.  It wasn't efected whatsoever by the wind...  It was as though it was on a precise course.  I actually thought it was a balloon...  But because of the glowing factor, the time of night (darkness) and the consistent pace it kept, we both realized it couldn't possibly be a balloon.   The night was quiet except for the cracling of the fire.   We both stood there watching the object move until it was out of site.  It appeared to go over and past the neighbors house.   We kept our eyes on the sky, but we didn't see anything else.;43.9671;-79.2422999999999
