UFO appearing 4 nights in a row;2010-08-29 02:00:00;4 hours;UFO appearing 4 nights in a row This occurrence has taken place on August 26th-29th 2010.  It begins at around 2: am until 5: am. It is only one object in the Western sky, about a hands width away from the Big Dipper.  Visible to the naked eye are blinking lights.   When looking through binoculars it is rounded in shape, and pulsates different colours, it appears to take on different shapes such as circular, and oval, and within the shape there are lines running through it glowing different colours.  Bright white is the predominate colour with red, blue, and green. It flies in no set pattern, it will hover then move diagonally hover again and then move vertically. It will also move in a circular pattern.  The object rests for no longer than 30 seconds and will move in an unpredictable flight pattern.   My husband as well as my two sons have witnessed this object ages 53, 25, 18.  My 25 year old son is a firefighter and he is not believing what he is seeing, actually none of us are.  Please !
