3 blinking lights in the sky;2014-10-31 06:30:00;2 minutes;3 blinking lights in the sky I was taking out the garbage that morning and glanced up at the sky and saw 3 blinking lights blinking one after the other in a horizontal line, I though it was a plane with a huge wing span until in a split second the line went from horizontal to a vertical line, then the middle light disappeared and the two remaining ones separated further apart then also disappeared, there was no sound at all.
