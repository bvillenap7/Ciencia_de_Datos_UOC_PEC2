Orange glowing object  following small white object;2010-07-04 22:50:00;2-3 Minutes;Orange glowing object  following small white object My son and I were at our cottage approx. outside of Haliburton, Ontario, Canada (44.931395,-78.359449).   We were out on the dock facing NNE at approx 22:50 on July 4th, 2010.   Roughly 60 degrees above the horizon, to the NNE, we noticed a large orange orb (mag of at least -8) moving across the sky from a north to south direction.  Looking closer we also noticed an other smaller object, white in color in front of the orange object.  The smaller object was visually typical of a satellite with a mag. of +4 or more, barely visible.  I was intrigued as it was not the space station as it would pass on the Southerly horizon. Mid way across the sky the two object disappeared.  This was also not a meteor as the two objects appeared to move much slower than a meteor.  There was no sound. Please feel free to contact me if you have additional questions.;45.0296;-78.5188
