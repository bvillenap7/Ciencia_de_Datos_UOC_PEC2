Glowing orange crafts seen over Haliburton, Ontario, Canada, July 25, 2008, 2150 hrs. Four adults observed first one then a second and a third, orange glowing orb shaped objects travelling from the southwest to the northeast at a rate of speed that was considered faster than an average aircraft. All three objects were in a perfect line-a-stern and appeared to be approx one kilometre apart.  They appeared to be relatively low compared to seeing a commercial airliner at night.  Although it is hard to judge vertical distance at night we estimate these objects to be below 10,000 feet. One observer works in Forest Fire Management and has significant experience dealing with aircraft as a helicopter management officer. The orange glow was constant and steady and as the first and third objects passed overhead the light diminished and disappeared.  The second object approached and when it was directly overhead it appeared to change direction and shoot straight up then disappeared.  There was absolutely no sound as the objects approached and passed overhead. One observer saw four brighter areas on the outer edges of the underside of on object that he describes as energy cells rather than just lights.;45.0296;-78.5188
