Orange Spheres dropping objects;2016-09-05 22:10:00;10 minutes;Orange Spheres dropping objects I live in southwestern West of London Ontario  Was just outside having a smoke. Seen a strange orange light coming up behind the tree line to my east. Seen another on farther up in the sky. Got my binoculars out and took a closer look. Arms on the body of the truck to keep it steady. They were very far away. They went up on about a 5 degree angle and then disappeared. Each light stayed visible for about 2 minutes.But when they were about a 1/3 of the way they were dropping something, white globes. seen this on at least 2 occasions.They were not planes and they were not flares. The Orange globes were very large. I would say 4 times the size of Venus with the naked eye in the sky.They were large enough in my binoculars to see it was some kind of structure, not a point of light. Seen one after another exact same pattern. Seen 5 or 6 in a row. Don't know how many there were before I went out. Time frame was aboutÂ 10:10 pm on September 5 2016.They also seems to be brighter orange on their bottom.;42.9086;-81.425
