Non-blinking Light Oval Object moving though the sky.;2003-08-27 22:07:00;10 Minutes;Non-blinking Light Oval Object moving though the sky. It was a light that was going decently fast though the air, the reason we think it was a UFO is because it wasn't blinking like a plane, it was bigger then the stars look, it was oval.  It wasn't going too fast, like a satellite. No unusal behaviour, but the main witness started crying.;42.2567;-82.4284
