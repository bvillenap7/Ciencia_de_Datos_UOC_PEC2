Not unusual, I live near a municipal airport.  This helicopter was different, totally black, even the windows were blacked out and had no markings.  I watched it circle the area for a few minutes until it disappeared to the south.  Still looking up, something caught my eye to north.  Two metallic orbs about 6-8 feet in diameter, 500 ft. in altitude were dancing, swirling around each other and bobbing up and down.  This went on for about 90 seconds until out of nowhere, the helicopter came racing towards the orbs at full speed.  The orbs stopped dancing, came together in formation and took off at about mach 2 to the west with the helicopter in full pursuit !  I thought: good luck trying to catch them!;43.1519336734693;-80.2683413265307
