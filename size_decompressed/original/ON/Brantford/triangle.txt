Silent dimly lit object sighted  moving rapidly over Southern Ontario;2001-12-08 19:35:00;15 seconds;Silent dimly lit object sighted  moving rapidly over Southern Ontario While outside on my 3rd floor balcony smoking on the evening of December 8, 2001 and as observing a regularly scheduled airline flying overhead I noticed a pattern of faint lights almost directly overhead.  The lights moved in a west to east direction and maintained a steady speed.  Elevation was difficult to assess, however, I estimate it at approximately 1500-2000 ft.   The pattern of seven (7) lights formed a V similar to a flock of geese.  The lights were very dim (similar to a 25 watt bulb at about 100 ft.).  There was no visible body to the object as it moved eastward at an increasing rate of speed.  There was no audible jet, propeller or rocket sound.  The night sky was totally clear and the path of the object did not intersect or come close to the flight path of either nearby major airports (within a 60 mile diameter).  The size of the craft would be at least that of a B-52 if not slightly larger, however, the rate of acceleration and our geographic location made me question that assumption immediately.   My interest in UFO's has been skeptical at best ... that is until I became the unexpecting witness to an object which does not fit any available logical explanation which I can arrive at to date.

Large red triangle shaped object traveling through night sky and was very clear night;2007-06-05 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;Large red triangle shaped object traveling through night sky and was very clear night Well it was at night and the sky was clear, i could see the stars and all that and then all of the sudden there was this triangle shaped object up in the sky and right away i knew it was'nt a plane or anything. It was a fair size and a ways in the air it had red lights all around and i could'nt beleive what i was seeing especially in Canada.  The object moved a bit but only for a few minutes if that and i kept my eyes on it the whole time then just like it showed up it was gone like it just took off using turbo jets or somthing.  I did'nt want to say anything but i found this site and i just have to now cause i seen this stuff on Larry King and i had to come on this site and write.  I do beleive we have other species looking down on us and one of these days there gonna make there selfs known if they have'nt already with the government.  But this was my experience and i beleived before this now i just beleive more. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));43.1519336734693;-80.2683413265307
A fast moving triangular object, with many flashing lights.;2009-08-03 04:36:00;3-4 minutes;A fast moving triangular object, with many flashing lights. I was outside having a cigarette, looking up at the sky, and coming into my view very fast was what appeared to be a jet at first from a distance.  The object began to take the shape of a triangular craft, with flashing lights ( like airplanes), but they were ever-changing. 4 lights could be seen, blinking and flashing. 2 would blink, then the other two, then they'd go dark and blink one after the other clockwise, with atleast 2 or 3 rotations per second. the object proceeded to zig zag across the sky, over me and kept going at an estimated altitude of between 8,000ft. to no more than 15,000ft. the color of te lights were neon green, blue, red, and white. it continued on until out of my sight, moving much to fast for an airplane.  No sonic boom or noise of jet engines was heard, no other planes in sight in the sky. It would travel a great distance in a straight line for a few seconds, then stop abruptly, move diagonaly from its previous course, and then spee! d up again.;43.1519336734693;-80.2683413265307
