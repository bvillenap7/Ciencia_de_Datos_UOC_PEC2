Couldn't tell how high up it was, don't think it was very high maybe 150 ft up.  It was dark, almost could not make out shape but it seemed to be a rectangle shape, black, with only three red circular shapes on it. Might have been lights, if so they were not bright, but dimmed down.  No sound. No blinking lights. And moved across the sky in a straight line quite fast and effortless.  Nothing I'd ever seen. Didn't know what to make of it. Not a plane or helicopter. Weird. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.1519336734693;-80.2683413265307
