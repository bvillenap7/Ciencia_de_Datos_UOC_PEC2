orange and white globes over Brantford Ontario Canada;2007-05-18 22:22:00;2 seconds;orange and white globes over Brantford Ontario Canada I was on the 6th floor of my apartment building and went out on the balcony and I looked up and about 200 feet above me and saw two circular shapes what where attached by something that looked like a string. The two circular shapes appeared to be orange and cut in half by white light and the string was also white. After about two seconds the object was gone above my apartment building.  My brother's girlfriend saw exactly what I saw and at the same time. we both saw the same thing and the same colours.;43.1519336734693;-80.2683413265307
