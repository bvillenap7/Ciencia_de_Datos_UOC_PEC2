Two Dark grey bat like objects in sky, no sound, no lights.;2019-10-23 11:00:00;5 minutes;Two Dark grey bat like objects in sky, no sound, no lights. Hi my sister and I were driving from Stanley St in Trenton Ontario. We took the 401 east towards Belleville, Ontario and as I was driving I sighted 2 strange objects in the sky. I asked my sister if she see's them she said yes, I said are they F18 fighter jets she said I don't think so I said neither do I. I said they look like the bat signal but no lights they were dark grey in colour had a saucer like bottom but jagged edge top. ( points) I asked my sister to keep her eye on them as i was driving and they were out of sight by then. I said are they on top of each other? she said they are just one now, it is like one morphed into the other.  Then it became a single unexplained object in the sky, and not two.  After which it disappeared as well. When we came home there were 2 F18 fighter jets in the sky after about 2 hours since our sighting. We could clearly see they were F18s and hear their roar. I an draw what I saw for you I do not have photo as I was drivi! ng on 401;44.0996424657534;-77.5721068493152
