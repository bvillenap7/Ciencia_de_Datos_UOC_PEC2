These fireballs were emitting fire. Already wrote to the wrong place about this. I wrote the report as...witness saw 4 or 5 Strange fier-balls. Friend described the first one to be as big as my park. I thought it was a joke and told her and her husband, that it was from the meteor showers. At the time, that it what I thought, and wrote Mr. Davenport about it...though, at the wrong place. Now, it is after 1:30am, and I just heard Mr. Davenport on Art Bell. What he described was just what my friend's husband saw while driving through Trenton, Ont, Canada. They (fireballs) were streaming not streaking, down. The first one was mighty huge and the other 3 or 4 other fireballs were following in accordance. They were actually following the first big one. Instead of dust trails, the witness saw ashes coming from the tail end of these...fireballs. Now I know, that meteor showers do not do such thing. They go any which way, but they do not follow each other like what was witnessed. All I can say, is this...THEY'RE COMING!!! YOU CAN'T STOP THEM...THEY'RE HERE!!! And no, I'm not a lunatic...I'm just being realistc...like Peter Davenport and all of you, who maintain this website...Be careful out there folks.;44.0996424657534;-77.5721068493152
