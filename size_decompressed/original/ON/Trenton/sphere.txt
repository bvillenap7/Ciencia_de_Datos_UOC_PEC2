((HOAX??))  Red crimson sphere golf ball sized moving around bedroom at night in Trenton, Ontario.;1998-02-23 23:30:00;1 minute;Red crimson sphere golf ball sized moving around bedroom at night in Trenton, Ontario A golf ball sized red glowing spherical object moved slowly into my darkened bedroom at 2330 around 30 February 1998.  I was laying on my right side in bed.  It was just visible over the side of the bed to catch my attention.  It seemed to be intelligent and seemed to want me to see it somewhat.  I got up on my knees and looked it as it stopped on the floor on some clothing.  I looked closer and it seemed to textured inside and crimson in colour.   My Airedale terrier came around the side of the bed from his pillow and was wagging his tail looking at the red sphere and then at me and back at the sphere.  The dog wanted to check it out but I stopped him.  I reached down of the bed and touch it but as I did it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
