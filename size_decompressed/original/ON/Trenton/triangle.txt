While driving close to may have been a few km outside of trenton ontario I saw and mentioned a 3 light combination hovering in the distance.  As we approached the anomaly while driving on the hwy we actually drove pretty much directly underneath it.  There were three ligjts white in colour no variation and they formed pretty much an equilateral triangle shape.  The reason I am even writing this is not the fact we saw this shape or light combination as I originally thought it would be a b2 bomber relation.  The fact is while we drove over the object it literally hovered above us with no movement   It was high enough that the entire encounter lasted a few minutes which was more than enough time for us to get a great look at it It was spectacular and with my basic understanding of our current level of technology I realized that we do not possess the tech to allow a mechanism of this size to hover in its place.  Was an amazing experience - it was very close to an air force base here and assume it would be related to an un announced flight tech but considered it still a ufo to the general populous...;44.0996424657534;-77.5721068493152
