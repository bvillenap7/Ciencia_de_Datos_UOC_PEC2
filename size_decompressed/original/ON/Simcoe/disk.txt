Circular beam of light/Blueish pulsating lights to each side/Large domed craft;2000-09-23 06:45:00;10 Minutes;Circular beam of light/Blueish pulsating lights to each side/Large domed craft It was pouring down rain as I was on my way to work from Kitchener Ontario to Simcoe. As I was coming down the highway about 8 minuets from Simcoe there was this large light low in the sky. I could see the object from about 4 miles away in Scotland Ont. It was about 200 or 300 feet above the bush. As I aproached this light there was this beam of light circling like a spotlight around the center parallel to the ground. Off to the sides there were two pulsating lights on each side, blueish white in color, in a V form. I could distigush that there was a bottom to this disk, a light glow. It was rocking side to side slightly. I observed this object for 10 minuets. Called my wife on the cell phone to tell what I was witnessing. Then I decided to go around the corner and get closer, that is when it totally disapeared.;42.8296;-80.2981
