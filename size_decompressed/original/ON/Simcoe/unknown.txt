A streak of greenish light moved across the sky in silence and disappeared in a second.  It was very bright and I just stood there in shock.  I have never seen anything like that before. I live in Simcoe, ON, Canada just north of Lake Erie.  The ribbon of light seemed to be moving from east to west at about 30 degrees above the horizon (I'm guessing).  Just shortly after this I saw a plane move slowly from north to south, also in the western sky.  The lights of the plane appeared very tiny compared to the size of the ribbon of light I saw.  I see many planes fly through this area at night when it is clear and that plane must have seen it too as it would be in front of and off to the side of the flight path, I think.;42.8296;-80.2981
