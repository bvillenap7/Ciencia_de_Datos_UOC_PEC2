It had a single light on each point and it stayed slowly hovering in place over the corner of the small town.  I was driving in my car when I saw this and I wasnâ€™t sure what it could be so I turned towards it.   After slowing down to a stop directly underneath it I was able to see the solid black body. This was 150 m off of Mount Albert road and highway 48. I was on the phone with my dad at the time and was shocked in what I saw.  I immediately let him go but was unable to get a picture with my phone.  The triangle began to move away slowly, I had my window down and it made no noise and no sound at all.  I began to follow it but it increased in speed and then just disappeared. I watched this for roughly about 30 seconds one thing I know for sure is that it was NOT an airplane and it was NOT a helicopter.;44.132;-79.3001
