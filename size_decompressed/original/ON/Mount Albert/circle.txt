Thre bright lights,turned red and streaked off.;2013-06-15 22:00:00;10 minutes;Thre bright lights,turned red and streaked off. On Saturday June 15th we were on our back deck. At around 10pm I noticed three bright lights in the north sky.  They seemed to be travelling at a fairly high rate of speed in a triangular formation.  My son thought they maybe military aircraft because commercial aircraft would not be that close together.  Then, one by one the lights turned bright red ,changed direction and seemed to streak off until they disappeared.   My wife got two photographs, enlarged on the computer the red one looks like a sphere, almost moon like. Iâ€™ve never seen anything like that before.  Could it have been a meteor shower?;44.132;-79.3001
