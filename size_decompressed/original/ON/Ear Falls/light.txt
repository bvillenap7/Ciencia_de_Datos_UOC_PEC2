Red light flanked by circle of orange flashes above treeline on road shoulder;2020-08-16 22:45:00;2-3 seconds;Red light flanked by circle of orange flashes above treeline on road shoulder Driving north along Highway 105 about 20km south of Ear Falls, my partner and I were going at 100km/h at 10:45pm.  I (passenger) saw a very bright red light up ahead on the left side of the highway, above the trees.  There was a big red light and a circle of 2-4 smaller lights under it, blinking orange/red.  I exclaimed WHAT is that? and my partner, who had been driving for 7 hours, guessed it was a tower.  He was driving, we were on the home stretch, and he didn't take a look at it because it was in our upper periphery as we passed it - it was kind of directly above the trees we passed, and I had to crane my neck to see the flashing as we approached. I joked that maybe I've been watching too many UFO documentaries, and we laughed it off. I deliberately used this reason not to turn around to take another look, but I have been thinking about it since.  Typically towers wouldn't be so close to the road shoulder like where this thing was, and the lights would be blinking way further up, not just at the treetops.  I have also never seen a tower with red AND orange lights, or orange lights which blink on/off/red erratically.;50.6355;-93.2364
