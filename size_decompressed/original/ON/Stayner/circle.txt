Four red glowing objects in the sky.;2014-04-20 21:05:00;5 minutes;Four red glowing objects in the sky. My wife and I were on an after dinner walk and were looking at the lower north west sky when we noticed 4 glowing red objects. The objects were either fixed in the sky or may have been moving extremely slowly but in tandem. The objects were of equal distance from one another and formed a zig-zag line in the sky with the most westerly object being the lowest in the sky and the most easterly object the being highest in the sky. We observed the objects for approximately 5 minutes.  The objects were not flashing but glowing with varying intensity. The highest and most easterly eventually faded and disappeared followed by the next most easterly until all four had disappeared. We continued to walk and watch the sky for another 30 minutes expecting to see F18 scrambled to the area but it was uneventful and silent. We decided to file the report wondering if others had observed the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.4115;-80.0841
