It was at least 2:23 AM when I glanced out my window before I was going to sleep. I looked at the stars, but one of them looked strange to me, so I stared at it. At first it was a white-yellow cream color, but it flashed greed, red, and blue as I watched. I thought that maybe it was a plane, until the object which was the shape of a star with a ring around it moved straight up and down and side to side in a matter of seconds. The best way that I can describe how fluent the movement's were is like dropping something in water and pushing it back up again. There was no sound, but as I watched it disappeared and reappeared in a matter of one second, almost like I'd blinked. There was only one of them, and there was a white aura type shading around it. The object emitted lights and it looked like someone was signaling someone else with a multi colored flash light. My sight was dulled a bit as I watched it, and I could hear a high pitched ringing the next day when I woke up in the morning. I don't know when the object was gone, because I was trying not to think of it, and I fell asleep. The sky was very clear that night. I do not need glasses, so aside from the weariness due to staring at the bright object, my sight and hearing were not impaired.;43.5947;-81.0883
