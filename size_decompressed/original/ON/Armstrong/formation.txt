Large formation of UFO's over sunset in Northern Canada;2002-09-15 22:00:00;5 seconds;Large formation of UFO's over sunset in Northern Canada It was day 1 of my month long fishing expedition on a small lake about 100 miles south of Armstrong Ontario. I had just started the campfire when I decided to snap some pictures of the beautiful sunset. Just as I was taking the first picture a formation of UFO's came down out of the sky above . This formation was of 10 bright flying craft. They appearred as in the photo as bright dot's on the horizon.  I could not believe that I actually got the picture of the UFO formation, something I will unlikely ever photograph again. ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time are approximate.  Witness provides photograph of setting Sun, with nine bright objects in two formations, against the evening sky.  Interesting photograph, in our opinion.  PD));50.5636;-89.4011
