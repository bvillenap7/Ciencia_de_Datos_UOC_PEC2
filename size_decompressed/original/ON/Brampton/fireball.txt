Bright shpere turning counter clockwise viewed north of brampton;1996-08-01 01:00:00;2 min;Bright sphere turning counter clockwise viewed north of brampton I was driving just north of brampton on Kennedy road with my ex wife. It was clear and warm out and very dark due to no lights. Driving along the road we were passing a field. The very second we past this dark field, I notice a extremly bright light. It appeared to me as the field was on fire. I mentioined this to my ex and she viewed the same thing. I slowed the car and viewed the bright object rise slowly above the lining of trees at the edge of the fields. The object then appeared to be turning in a counter clockwise motion. Each time it turned it was like a series of lights flashing. The object continued to rise right above the road.  Both I and my Ex was terrified and I sped away as quick as my car was able to go. The object disappeared in the view of my mirrors and I returned home. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
Noticed a blue fireball and cloud/chem trail in the sky;2010-07-14 22:44:00;approx 1 sec;Noticed a blue fireball and cloud/chem trail in the sky Sitting on my porch at 2244hrs (10:44pm) I was watching the sky as always when A blue fireball went straight across my field of vision approx 100 meters away,   And maybe 300 feet in the air.  It appeared in the SSE sky,   In a major landing path For Pearson International Airport.  The total visible time of the blue fireball was 1 second or less.  The fireball left some sort of cloud/chem trail that I observed from 2244hrs until 2302hrs.  The cloud/chem trail was at first whitish, not very long in length,and then changed color to orange,   And then streched to 6 times bigger then first left.  I timed it after the sighting.It was a clear night in southern Ontario.I seen the weather satillite image on the news(and the sky with my own eyes).  What I thought was weird and could possibly back up my sighting was that the airplanes waiting to land at PIA,stopped circling in the west sky and started circling over lake Ontario.  The time I noticed that the planes changed their landing pattern! was 2254hrs.If this helps.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
Orange Orb/Fireballs seen by family of three;2012-09-28 22:30:00;2 minutes;Orange Orb/Fireballs seen by family of three I went outside at approximately 22:30 and witnessed at first two orange colored fireballs/orbs that were flying by overhead in front my home. I first observed them for approximately thirty seconds the first two were flying relatively close to one another but soon began to move slowly apart they were heading in a westerly direction.  The size of the objects were approximately three quarters the size of a full moon they also exhibited a weak light pulsing effect (glowing).  After the first thirty seconds of observation I ran inside and shouted to my parents, There's UFO's outside!  Come quick!  Come quick!?  My parents both rushed out to observe the rest of event. Within ten seconds of observation by all three of us my father noticed a third object of exactly the same description as the other two which was further behind the other two objects but heading in the same direction. The third object followed behind the other two and we observed them disappearin! g to the west in approximately two minutes. Additional observations:  Sound: None Height Estimation From Ground: 1.5 KM Speed Estimation: 200 KM/H Additional Objects: A plane within the same general vicinity Other Witnesses: I talked with a person who lives down the street from me who also witnessed these objects from a different view point. His description of initial observation was that he saw all three flying in a triangular formation and they came from the South-East. Background information of myself: I grew up in the area and have lived in Brampton my whole life, this is the second time in my life that I have observed UFO(s) in my area. First time was when I was Eighteen years old (Approximately twelve years ago) I have never reported this sighting. I'm a fairly down to Earth kind of person who enjoys the outdoors (primarily fishing) I also am fairly computer savvy and enjoy creating fan based video game content.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
