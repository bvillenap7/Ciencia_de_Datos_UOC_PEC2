It's trajectory was directly behind a large commercial aircraft that had caught my attention. As it passed above me, where the sky was clear, craft rapidly de-cellerated at the same time changing shape (2 curved points appeared at opposite sides of craft during de-celleration). The craft made an S turn starting with a turn right, then left, then right again. As it made this last right turn, it rapidly accelerated out of sight travelling west.  I have not clicked on the characterisitics of object because none are accurate. The craft itself was lit up and the light emitted remained constant even as the shape and speed were changing.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001

I saw out my back windows (facing west) a large bright yellow light. It was on a path to come right over our house, so thinking it was a helicopter i got up and walked out the back door to watch it fly over. Once outside i knew it was not a helicopter because there was no noise – i yelled for my grandson and my daughter to come see what i was looking at. Points to note: I live in the northwest region of a major metropolitan area. There are famer  fields a short distance away (to the west the direction of what i saw) – Also i am northwest of an major international airport and during my sighting i could see a commercial plane off in the distance in the same line of sight that we were looking at. (they were landing from the west that night – flying east on approach) There was not a cloud in the sky it was a beautiful night with a beautiful full moon off to the south. The large yellow light seemed bigger then what a helicopter or plane light would illuminated in the beginning.( My grandson who is  5 said it was a fire in the sky).  The large yellow light then gave way to a green and red light which was decreasing in size.  Although it was still coming straight towards us, it was not a perfectly straight line that it travelled. It seemed to move from side to side ever so slightly.  The red light was getting smaller and for a few seconds the green light seemed to be a straight line of green light going through the red light. (still not any noise whatsoever). The green light gave way to only the red light which continued to shrink in size until it was almost out of sight. At this point it changed direction not heading towards us but turned on a 90 degree angle and started heading north. Now it get hard to explain – the small red dot now seemed to be part of a larger translucent type of oval object that if you were not looking right at you probably would not see.  The oval did not glow although it gave off the smallest shade of light – It was a different colour than the night sky, my daughter and i watched it until it went out of sight behind trees. I do not know what we saw other than to say that i am a keen observer of my surroundings – & i have never seen anything like this before. Sorry very hard to explain in written text for me.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001

Shifted Circular to triangular shape;2014-09-27 22:35:00;2 minutes;Dim and blurry, slow moving UFO(s).  Close grouping or one object - greyish with some dark red.  Shifted Circular to triangular shape At approximately 22:35 on Saturday, September 27, 2014 my son – who is 15 (a high-school student) and myself – I am 50 (an electrician by trade)- saw an odd object in the sky of South Brampton.  There is an airport nearby – Pearson International – and many planes fly in this vicinity day and night. I've seen many interesting things above my house in the past few years.  I've seen satellites fly over head meteors, airplanes and unidentifiable object on occasion. This one was most definitely a UFO.  From where I have no idea. I was standing in my driveway and looking at the sky – as I often do – and noticed a blurry object I thought might be a star.  As I continued looking I was certain it was moving in my direction.  I watched for about 30 seconds and ran inside the house to tell my son and get my binoculars. My son joined me outside and I pointed the object out to him.  It was now approaching us and nearing the overhead position.  We both looked at it with the binoculars.  Neither of us could clearly focus on it. Either with the binoculars or naked eyes the object looked blurry. It was rather dim – no bright lights.  The dim lights were impossible to focus clearly-on.  They were a dull grey colour and changed to a very dark, dim red on occasion.  It looked like there were perhaps 3 to 5 different lights but they may have been part of a single or several objects clumped together. This object – or tight group of objects – appeared to change shape from circular to triangular with no definite shape at any given time  We watched this for at least 2 minutes with naked eyes and binoculars.  It was moving from the East South East direction to the West, North-West direction initially and turned pretty well due West near the end of when we could still see it.  It faded and was no longer visible as it – at the end of the observation – was heading West towards the town of Georgetown.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001

The person with me also agreed that whatever it was looked and acted very strange a not like something we can recognise that it was;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
