I observed this a few times in the last two years and once one was very low and very large flat craft  with flashing lights and no sound there is always a large light in the distance which appears to be stationary. All the craft fly to this light and then everything disappears. Since this is so close to Pearson International airport it would seem reasonable that they would know what these are and be monitoring their movements,however in my estimation these are not passenger aircraft.This is happening now as I type this. What this is I have no idea.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
Red glowing object flew in south-east direction 2230 EDT - disappeared after approx two minutes.;2015-06-21 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;Red glowing object flew in south-east direction 2230 EDT - disappeared after approx two minutes One June 21st, 2015 at approximately 22:30 EDT, I went outside to set up my camera to experiment photographing the planets Jupiter and Venus since they were very bright near the crescent moon. As I was positioning the camera and tripod to point toward the moon and two planets, I noticed a bright red object moving from north-west to south-east.  This would be parallel to Main Street.  There was no sound and the light did not appear to vary in intensity.  There were no flashing lights that I could see, just a constant red glow. I turned the tripod to point the camera so I could try to get a photo of the object.  It was dark as I had switched off my outside lights and that caused some difficulty in arranging the camera and tripod.  Just as I got the camera pointed in the right direction, the object appeared to vanish into thin air.  It did not accelerate, change direction of in any other way indicate it would be gone.  It just vanished.  Unfortunately, I did not get a photograph. Total elapsed time was about two to three minutes  There were aircraft passing by at higher altitudes and in different directions and I could see their flashing lights.  This object was not like any airplane Iâ€™d ever seen. I am a sixty-four year old male who enjoys accounting as a career along with computers and photography as hobbies.  I do not drink alcohol other than the occasional bottle of beer or glass of wine with a friend about once a year.  I do not take any recreational drugs and I do not smoke, anything.  I am in good health both mentally and physically.  I am near sighted and my eyeglasses give me excellent distance vision.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
Low altitude bright white light slowly travelling south east.;2015-09-16 21:15:00;10 seconds;Low altitude bright white light slowly travelling south east. My husband and I observed, at a fairly low altitude, a white light moving slowly from south east to north east.  It was fairly bright and as we observed it, it just dimmed and went out. We have an app on our iphones that tracks commercial planes flying in the air around us and we both confirmed that there were none atall in the area, especially in that direction at that time.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
Hovering object so bright like a star.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a possible sighting of a star or planet.  PD));2016-03-17 04:15:00;Unknown;Hovering object so bright like a star. Saw clear sky with stars but this one star was so bright, I started to observe it closely and felt it was having a small motion mostly hovering motion.   Decided to check myself I shot a video of it with my iPhone held against patio door firmly so I can get some non shaky footage.  I reviewed the footage and found the object whatever it is to be hovering and having slight movements. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a possible sighting of a star or planet.
