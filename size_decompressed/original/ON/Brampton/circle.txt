On our left was a forest and a flea market and on the right was some house so we were caring on a conversation when i looked over in the feild when i seen a looked like a circle thing it was  well looked about as big as the moon from far away and it had white blue and red blury lights all around the sides the  bottom of it looked like 4 little  odd shaped triangles like a drawling on the bottom that they formed a circle but they were made from triangle things and it looked like a little very little amount of fog from it I was like oh my god and i said jessi look and we were just standint there and we didnt even talk it stood like  not even 1 block away from us  and it was over a bare tree befor the forest and flea market just in the middle of the feild so we just stood there and were like what is it so I stared at it and jessi looked to the right where the houses were and so I looked at the houses but 5 seconds later we looked right were it was and it was gone within 5 seconds whatever it was, it was gone like no tace of what way it went no light no sounds it was just like  it vanished so then we ran home and we got in trouble for staying out that long but we told my mom what we saw and she says a few months prier my sister and my mom seen a similar object outfront in a feild about a mile away so we never really talk about it but we know it was definatly not a airplain or a kite or anything and so thats my story and thats what happend on halloween 98 so now Jessi and i both beleive in aliens now. and when that happend me and ((name deleted)) were both 12 but we both know what we saw;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Two circular quickly started to accelerate north.;2004-03-19 05:30:00;approx: 40 seconds;Two circular quickly started to accelerate north. Shape of objects: Round or Circular like Full Description of event/sighting: At about 5:30 a.m. eastern time I was at work and stepped outside into the yard to have a cigarette. It was about 30 minuets to dawn yet so I could still make out some of the stars. As I was admiring the morning sky I noticed what I thought to be a star in a unusual area of the sky at that time of morning and noted its unusual color which was an orange pinkish hue.Then I seen It start to slowly move in a northerly direction and thought I was seeing a high flying aircraft as my place of employment is about 15 kilometers from Pearson Int. Airport and we have commercial aircraft fly directly over our building at any given moment of the day. Usually the planes at that time in the morning come in from the west and then bank  south to the runways. What I saw next was amazing. The object I seen quickly started to accelerate north where it met with another similar object which seemed to appear out of nowhere and they both banked hard and fast to the west accelerating and decelerating like they were playing with one another and while this was going on they seemed to wobble and shimmer. I thought I may be imagining things but I wasn't. They were flying at approximately 7 to 10,000 feet and accelerated more than the speed of a visible satellite seen on a clear night.

Apparently one red hued object with 2 lights becomes 2 near Pearson International Airport at 20:40 HRS March 27 2005.;2005-03-27 20:40:00;12 seconds;Apparently one red hued object with 2 lights becomes 2 near Pearson International Airport at 20:40 HRS March 27 2005. I was lying on my front porch at the bequest of my little son (something I wouldn't normally do at this time of year) with my son and daughter.   We were simply looking at the stars.  We saw a couple of star-like objects move across the sky and I mentioned to them that they were likely satellites and that I had seen a lot of them in my years.  We were about to go inside when I saw two blurry redish hues (I can't really call them lights because they were not as clear as that, they gave off the sort of light you would see if you were to look at a black light.) I didn't think much of it at first as there is an international airport near us.  I told the kids to look at that plane and my daughter saw it but my son did not.  Just as I said that, the lights separated by about 8 times the distance they were when we first saw them!  This indicated to me that it was not a single object but two seemingly identical objects.  The speed with which they separated was quite quick, and they then proceeded to accelerate in a south-westerly direction far more rapidly than any plane could.  The duration of this observation was approximately 12 seconds and they covered 80% or so of our field of view in that time.  We lost sight of them due to the lights of the city.  I decided that I should call the ufo hotline center as I have NEVER seen anything as obviously unidentifiable as this before and I have watched the skies on and off in the Muskoka's and elsewhere thousands of times in my life just enjoying the stars and looking for events such as this!  I should include that I contacted the local air traffic control centre in Mississauga at Pearson International Airport.  I got no answer but a woman at Terminal 3 took my name and number and said they would call me back.  An hour has passed and they have not.  I find it a little strange that there are no airplanes in the area at this time - an hour since we saw these objects - and this being Easter Sunday and Pearson being a fairly busy airport, I would expect that there would be several jets in the sky!  Perhaps they did see something and have kept the air space clear because of this??? The phone number for the air traffic control centre is 905-676-3074 if anyone would like to follow this up in a more official manner than I am likely able to.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
On Sept 16/2006 silent silver sphere passed horizontally overhead slowly, seemed to avoid viewing by rapidly ascending into cloud cover;2006-09-15 14:00:00;5 min.;On Sept 16/2006 silent silver sphere passed horizontally overhead slowly, seemed to avoid viewing by rapidly ascending into cloud cover To the best of my recollections, as I cannot find my copy of the original report this occurred about 2 pm in Bramalea, Ontario on Friday September 15 2007 and I was sitting outside in my friend’s backyard. That it is near Pearson Int. Airport is surprising to me. The sighting lasted a good 5-6 minutes. When I first saw the object, it was hard to grasp what I was seeing. My second thought was maybe it was some kind of perfectly round and silver coloured balloon, but it could not have been both by its configuration and its motion. There were 2 lines running horizontally in the mid section as if of windows but of the same silver metallic material. Its look and behaviour suggested intelligence and purpose. It moved silently. When it first caught my eye it was travelling horizontally slowly at approximately 500 to 1000 feet. It was hard to judge height accurately as it was a bright clear sky and there were only thin wispy patches of clouds at around 10,000 feet. As the object passed out of sight over the roof line I moved to continue viewing this phenomenon. As I moved, the object started a rapid right turn as if to block my view with other roofs, so I moved further. Each time I moved it seemed to attempt avoiding my gaze. Finally I had a full view of the sky at that height. It then suddenly went straight up and within 4-5 seconds had hit the cloud layer and disappeared from view.  As for size I can only guess that it was about the size of a dump truck. Weeks later I noted that a near earth encounter of an asteroid occurred on Sept. 16, and I wonder if this had anything to do with this vehicle being there at that time perhaps to view the close fly-by. I don’t know. It has remained a profound event to me and I am sure it was either not from our time or not from our planet.   Respectfully, Mike M.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
a silver ball with 3 square indentations about 500 feet up.;2006-09-15 14:00:00;3 min.;a silver ball with 3 square indentations about 500 feet up. one Friday in Sept./06 i was sitting in my friends backyard admiring the beauty of the trees when i noticed a silver ball in the sky about 500 feet up. it was moving slowly in a straight line. as i moved to see it as it passed behind the roof, it started to turn slightly west behind the roof again as if to avoid being seen. the more i moved to see it the more it turned moving now south west. i moved again and had unrestricted view, at which point it suddenly ascended rapidly until it disappeared into thin cloud at about 1000 feet. it had 3 square indentations in the lower half of the circle. i believe it was something unusual.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
