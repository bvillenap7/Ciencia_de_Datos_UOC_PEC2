What really gave it away was that there were so many of them in such a small space.  110% they were not aircraft. They flew together at a same constant pace.  They all were glowing white, Amber and red, at times they were very visable, then they'd disappear then alternately reappear. There were 12-14 UFO's in total and they were heading to the east. Two of the groupings flew in a column of three high, some two high. But very close together.  Was nothing military and it wasn't the snowbirds!!;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
