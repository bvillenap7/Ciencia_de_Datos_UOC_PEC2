((HOAX??))  White box with orange light.;2015-05-27 20:00:00;5 minutes;White box with orange light. Was in my friend's backyard, jumping on a trampoline, when suddenly I saw a box with a orange light on it.  My friend thought it was an airplane, but it was definitely not an airplane.   We were then both staring at it and it turned around, and dropped about 20,000 feet in a matter of seconds, then it hovered over his backyard maybe 100 feet above then, I tossed a rock at it and zoomed away and it made a gust of wind! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the report is intended as a hoax.  PD));43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
