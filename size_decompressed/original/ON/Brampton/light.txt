It was approximately 10:00pm sometime in August of 1999, I was at a friends house and we were in his backyard patio chatting with a few other friends. It was a very clear night and the sky was fileld with stars. I noticed this bright light object in the distance which was probably (from my sight) the size of half a penny, maybe a little smaller. It definitly was not a plane. It was bright and heading straight up, it was quite far so the actual speed is unknown, but it must have been moving fast, I pointed the object out to my friends who were also stunned. We were facing north at the time of the incident. The object flew straight up towards the sky for approximately 15 seconds, and slowly got smaller and smaller as it got higher, then at one point just looked like a star in the sky and dissapeared.

Two lights on different paths vanish in same area of clear night sky.;2002-08-06 23:50:00;1- 1 1/2 Minutes;Two lights on different paths vanish in same area of clear night sky. I was standing on my balcony facing East, looking at the big dipper, when I noticed at first what I thought was an aircraft on approach to YYZ come across the bottom part of the big dipper from my FOV in a Southernly direction at high altitude, traveling at what you may expect to see an airliner moving at.  The light became brighter during it's path, and I figured it was lowering it's altitude while I watched.  The light then went much dimmer and quickly went out of sight as if it the light just went out. There were no clouds, and I could see all the other star formations around where it vanished.  I thought that was pretty weird, then noticed a second, slightly dimmer light also at high altitude approach the same area from the East, and also vanished in pretty much the same area of sky.  As I said, there were no clouds, and my view was unobstructed. One aircraft had taken off from YYZ in a North then Westernly direction shortly before these events, which is not unusual. I'll email a diagram and label it as a DTG: ((deleted)).jpg;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
2 small bright objects moving very fast and doing 360's around each other.;2005-03-27 22:15:00;10-15 seconds;2 small bright objects moving very fast and doing 360's around each other. I saw what I thought was a satellite but quickly realized there were two objects.  They looked like faint stars in the sky.  They came from the southeast in a straight line, then they started flying around each other for about 5 seconds, then took off at a very high speed directly north right beside each other.  The whole thing only lasted about 10 to 15 seconds. They did not make any sound. It almost looked like they were playing with each other. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

A little after 22:08hrs,lying in bed I heard a common but strange noise.Almost as if someone was rubbing their finger on a half full crystal wine glass.As the noise came closer a round,almost white in color dull light,approxamitly 20-25 feet across and 75-90feet in the air came into view from the NNW ski,stopped over my backyard and hovered for 4 seconds.Then this light did not turn but left slowly into the NNE ski.The total time of this account took between 13-15 seconds.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
Fireball turned to small orb;2012-09-07 23:00:00;20 minutes;Fireball turned to small orb I noticed a flash in the sky and looked up to see what looked like something burning up in the atmosphere. The flames died quickly and left a bright orb which kept moving same direction (north). This orb dimmed from a very bright round light to a smaller, star-sized light. I pointed the object out to a friend sitting next to me and he confirmed that he was seeing the bright object move north as well. It moved in such a perfectly straight line that I thought it must be a satellite in orbit.  As I was considering this possibility, it moved in semi-circle (east, south-east) and stopped dead in the sky. It stayed perfectly still and looked not unlike any of the stars in the sky but it was much brighter than any of the stars. It stayed there for approximately twenty minutes. I kept peering upwards to make sure it was still there and after the twenty minutes had gone by it had vanished entirely.

2 amber lights moving slowly over Ontario sky.;2013-04-06 22:30:00;30 minutes;2 amber lights moving slowly over Ontario sky. I went outside for a cigarette and noticed 2 lights flying in sync coming from the south east and moving towards the northwest. The objects both had amber lights. They were too close together to be two seperate airplanes and too far apart to be a single aircraft. They moved slowly across the sky and no engine noise was heard.  The sky was overcast at the time of the sighting.  As they passed one of the objects had moved ahead and the other moved very slow.  At this time the trailing objects lights were not visible but I could see a silouette of the vehicle from the the city lights.  It was shaped almost like a disc. A craft I have never seen before.   As it disappeared I ran in to tell my wife what I saw and she thought I was crazy.   We went outside and saw the same lights approach from the same area that I saw them previously and moving in the exact same direction.  Same amber lights as last time. We went inside and tried to call our neighbor to come out and look b! ut couldn't get a hold of them. So we went outside again 5 mins later and saw the same lights for a third time approaching again from the southeast moving towards the northwest. An airplane was taking off from the airport at this time as well, but moving in a different direction. At this time I took out my phone and recorded video in which you can see the airplane exit the video to the left and you can hear its engines. On this pass one of the objects went from having an amber light to a white and red colour which was very visible. You can't make this out in the video though.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001

Explosive round impulse light, medium green in color, straight up overhead and stationary.  As green light expanded and impulsed at its maximum brightness, green light completely vanished and never returned visible again after that point.

Light flew across the sky very fast and silent then turned back and flew the way it came from;2020-08-12 23:00:00;5 minutes;Light flew across the sky very fast and silent then turned back and flew the way it came from Waiting for a meteor shower to begin I was watching the sky with binoculars. I saw a dot moving incredibly fast.  When I moved the binoculars away it was not visible to the naked eye. That dot moved across the sky and then stopped and made a J type turn and flew back the way it came. If flew from south to the north then back again. Then vanished. There were 2 planes in the sky at the time and this dot that flew had no night time flashing lights etc like the planes have;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
