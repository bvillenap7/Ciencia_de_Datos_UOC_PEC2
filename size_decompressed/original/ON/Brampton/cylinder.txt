I was at a local garage sale on my street and was talking to one of the home owners when another person said “ look over there, do you see that”.  He was pointing west, up in the sky. At first I couldn’t see what he was talking about …then as it moved closer I could see a dark object slowly moving from west to east.   At first I thought it might be a balloon just drifting in the wind but the object wasn’t gaining any height. It was moving horizontally to the ground. It was a black object against pale grey clouds. It seemed to be rotating and had a slight wobble.  The object passed overhead and continued to move eastward. Neighbourhood trees eventually blocked our vision of it. I’ve seen balloons pass overhead and they usually rise straight up till they are out of sight or burst. This travelled across the sky at a constant distance from the g! round. I do not know how big it was or how high it was off the ground. It was kind of oblong, dark black in colour, rotated with a slight wobble, no noise was detected. It stayed below the cloud level. One person tried to take a picture of it on his cell phone but it wouldn’t show up. It was about ½ to ¾ of my thumb-to the first knuckle. What really makes this odd is that we had just been talking about strange things that go on in this world…..and then we see an object float by….hum;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
