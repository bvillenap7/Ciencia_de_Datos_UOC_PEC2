Two bright flashes in Eastern sky 15 seconds apart.;2002-07-05 01:25:00;15 Seconds;Two bright flashes in Eastern sky 15 seconds apart. Hello. At aprox 1:25 am 5 July, 2002, I was on my balcony in Brampton and noticed two bright white flashes in the Eastern sky at aproximately a 35 degree angle from the horizon at great distance. The flashes were about 15 seconds apart in a cloudless sky, with dim stars in comparison. Both flashes were in the same position. I scanned the sky for several minutes after the event but saw nothing further. There were no aircraft visible whatsoever during the event. I am quite used to observing aircraft in this area and the flashes instantly struck me as unusual and inconsistant with anything else I'd observed in the past. Perhaps someone else witnessed this as well.;43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
