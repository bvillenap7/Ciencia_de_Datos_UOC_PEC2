This is in regards to your reports on the home page reagrding the bizarre triangle shaped object witnessed in Gagetown, New Brunswick.  I, in the same month (unfortunately, do not remember the day) witness what seems to be the same or simular object. It was approximatey 23:30 E.S.T when I had finished some school work and decided to go for a walk and have a cigarette because I didn't enjoy smoking in the house. Brampton, Ontario , at the time was stil a developing city (at least in the west end where I was) So you can have an idea of the area, there would be pockects of new developements and open fields in between. I had my walkman with me at the time and I enjoy my music very loud. After about 20 minutes of walking and taking in the beautiful weather I heard a humming noise over top of my walkman - I naturally assumed that it was a transport truck or something in the area. I turned off my walkman and that's when I realized the sound was coming from over head. When I looked up I was in awe of what I was seeing. I was not frightened or nervous. The object was no more than 50 stories above me. It was black, Triangular shaped, and had only three light at each corner. The object must have been the size of a football field. The object hovered in one place, directly above me for 1 minute when it shot off (from a stand still) and out of my sight in less than a second. This is when I became nervous. I do not know anything in physics that could propel itself from a stand still like that. I hurried home and as you probably encounter daily, I was met with ridicule from my friends and family. Three days later, while I was at school, three men in black came to my home and asked my mother all kinds of strange questions. They repeatedly asked if they could come in, and when my mom responded, no, they would ask something else. Where I was from? Where I was? How old I was? Could they come back and see me later. When I spoke with my mother later that day. All she kept saying is that they looked very strange....very odd. that's it. At that point, I dropped the UFO conversations and left it alone until tonight when I came across your site and the people from Newbrunswick that witnessed the same thing as I did, and in the same month. Just thought you would like to hear about it. For my security, I will not leave any personal information. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Witnessing a triangular shaped object in the sky, travelling slow, low & silent with red, green, white lights on edges.;1993-06-01 20:30:00;3 minutes;Witnessing a triangular shaped object in the sky, travelling slow, low & silent with red,green,white lights on edges. My neighbour, my husband , and myself were all in the backyard at around 10:00 pm at night. We were discussing building a fence later that summer.  We saw this strange looking triangular object in the sky fly above us.  It was quiet, absolutely no noise heard from it.  It was travelling low and in a south-east direction.  It was about the size of the Good Year blimp but its shape was triangular.  It had about 20 lights all around its edges and they would flash in pairs in a synchronized pattern.  These lights were green, red  and white.  It was travelling slow and just glided over our heads.  It seemed like it was floating also like the Good Year blimp .  It continued on its way and eventually was gone.  It was consistent in speed, not erratic but slow, and we wished it was not dark out to see clearly was this was.  This all happened in about a 3 minute period. We will never forget it.  What baffled us the most was it being completely silent and the lights flashing in this unusual pattern.  We never saw anything like it again.  We still talk about it now and then. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.7106958641061;-79.7692394387001
