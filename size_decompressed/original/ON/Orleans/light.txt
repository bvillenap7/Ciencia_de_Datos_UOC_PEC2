Two red lights seen over eastern ontario in the north/eastern direction of the sky;2008-04-06 23:45:00;8-12 seconds;Two red lights seen over eastern ontario in the north/eastern direction of the sky. Myself and two friends were relaxing in the hot tub in my backyard and I was looking up at the sky, hoping to perhaps see a shooting star as I often do. After a good 4 minutes of just staring upwards, I saw two circular red lights appear out of thin air in the Northern part of the sky and they hovered shakingly for about 3 seconds. By that time I had yelled to the people who were with me and they quickly turned their attention to the direction that I had pointed. We all watched as the two lights moved across the sky from the North part of the sky all the way to the East part. The way they were moving was strange too, almost as if they were chasing one another. They moved in and out in a disarranged criss cross motion weaving in and out from each other, shaking and almost bending in shape. They reached the Eastern side of the sky in approximately 8 seconds, and they made no sound what so ever before they vanished as easily as they had appeared.;45.4726444444444;-75.4979622222222
