Then, the circles got closer and closer to us, getting bigger and bigger, up to a point where we could see that ezch craft had about five lights total and was revolving aroud, like a frisbee when it flies in the air. then , they started spinning faster and faster the lights got blurry and made it seem like they had only one bright red light each, around the entire ship. then, all of a sudden, they just blasted away and we never saw them again. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the effect could have been caused by an advertising light, either laser-based, or a typical revolving spotlight.  Just a guess we do not know what the witnesses observed.  PD));45.4726444444444;-75.4979622222222
