Two rotating rings, one inside the other, counter clockwise.  About 12 lights on outer, 5 on inner.;2000-11-04 18:15:00;8 mins;Two rotating rings, one inside the other, counter clockwise.  About 12 lights on outer, 5 on inner. Saw it as my husband and I were travelling on Hwy. 401 between Cardinal and Prescott. on the N. Side of the 401.  The lights were two rings rotating.  The outside ring, estimate 50 ft.  The inner ring about 15 ft. (Not sure how big as it was high up in the air.  It was above the tree line and there was mist and the lights reflected through.  The lights were white.  Both rings rotated at same speed, not slow but not real fast. Maybe 60rpm.  I looked at it and thought maybe something from the ground shining up but there was nothing from the ground up.  I watched it for a few minutes and it seemed to keep up with us.  I told my husband to pull over but the traffic was to fast to enable us to do so safely.  He looked in the mirror and saw the lights. It seemed to follow for a few seconds then stopped and faded into the high mist.  I could see the aura of it after it faded until we were out of range.  (We turned off the 401 onto a off ramp. at Prescott).   I have absolutely no idea what it could have been. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness has included an illustration, which we will attempt to include here in the near future.  It is a very bizarre collection of lights, moving in a very unusual pattern.  It does not appear to be consistent with a conventional rotating advertising light.  PD));44.8681;-75.4489
