multiple ufo sighting;1998-08-26 21:30:00;20 min or more;multiple ufo sighting objects were seen around the Floating Bridgearea.(well known)it was very dark. Two of us were first to observe while driving, then as we decided they weren't helicopters(no noise) we stopped at the side of the road(county road 6) where we saw another man already shaken by what he was seeing. He said that he saw one circle a star and then take off. The objects seemed to hover at one point(near a plant called UTDC-paint trains etc) then moving away at high speeds(together).They seemed to be diamond shape from what we could tell in the darkness, and in the centre of the bottom was a light thats' color is hard to describe. Sort of orange purple and blue mix(not separate lights), we tried to get under it but at this point they were travelling at speeds higher than 100 miles an hr(because thats how fast we were going).;44.2165;-76.6501
