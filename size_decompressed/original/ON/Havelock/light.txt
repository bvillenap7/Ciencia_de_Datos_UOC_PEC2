This was a Saturday night at around 9:30 P.M.  Perfectly clear sky.  No wind at all.  I was out making a fire near the water on Belmont Lake near Havelock, Ontario.  Finally got it going nicely and did hear fireworks now and then, but they were the cracker type, not the kind that explode in the air.  I sat down facing the west and saw a red light through the trees but the light was much farther away than the trees.  The tree had dropped most of its leaves so I could easier see through it.   I saw this light coming over a cottage about 500 yards away from the west from up on the main road.  It was not travelling very fast, so I went to the cottage to get the other person to look at this light.  The other person said it is just an aircraft.  I said it is one constant bright color of red, no noise, it is not a plane it is not blinking and is not high in the sky like all other planes and there is no wind for it to be a balloon and it is to bright red.  It is not fireworks, because the light is constant.   The red light was moving toward the South East, and never varied in height.  Then it went out of site, miles away.   There was only one bright red light.  The light was lot bigger than the normal air craft lights and was closer to the earth.  I had a clear view nothing impeded it.  The object did not leave any vapour trail.;44.4312;-77.8792
