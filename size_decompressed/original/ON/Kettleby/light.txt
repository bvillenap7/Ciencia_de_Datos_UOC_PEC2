bright, fast moving light in the night sky;2002-10-05 22:00:00;5 seconds;bright, fast moving light in the night sky We were getting some fresh air on the balcony at a wedding reception, when all of a sudden we both saw what we thought was a shooting star in the eastern sky going from south to north.  The object shot across the sky very much like a shooting star, but part way through its flight, it suddenly made about an 80-degree turn and continued very quickly in a westerly direction across the sky.  It then went in a circle and seemed to zig-zag before it shot off across the sky and disappeared in the light pollution on the western horizon.  The object moved very quickly, and appeared to be very high up, leaving a faint tail.  It was bright and appeared to flash briefly once or twice.;44.0079;-79.5726
