huge saucer, lights in the ccentre slowly moving throughout the sky;2005-03-08 20:00:00;2 minute;huge saucer, lights in the centre slowly moving throughout the sky One enourmous saucer appeared directly above the middle of the road as I turned the corner of a main street I was driving on.  It was a saucer with lights in the middle of it.   I pulled over and I viewed it as it made its way across the sky making a turn and disappearing out of sight.  It was going fairly slow.

silver disk in between clouds, very big, 1 minute;2007-02-10 15:30:00;1 minute;silver disk in between clouds, very big, 1 minute Driving home, I looked into the sky and saw a large silver disk (large because it was very close) mixed in between clouds either slowly moving or hovering, depending if the clouds were moving.  It was directly above my head where the clouds form (1 km in height???).  I pulled over to see it more clearly and it was gone, either camouflaged with the clouds or just gone, but I could no longer see it.  It was sunny with blue skies and cloudy.

silver disk,  hovering in the sky approx. 1 minute;2007-03-15 16:00:00;1 minute;silver disk, hovering in the sky approx. 1 minute Coming off the highway, a silver disk was hovering in the clear blue sky.   I pulled over to make sure I was seeing what I was seeing.  Sure enough as I tried to keep my eye on it and pull over, it had just disappeared with no trace of it in sight.  Again, the sky was extremely clear blue that day and it was sunny so I’m guessing that’s how it hid itself so good.   Because of its distance (approx. 1 km away and fairly high in the sky) all I can say is that it was in the shape of a disk and it appeared to be silver due to the colour of the sky (no clouds) and the brightness of the sun that day.
