I was sitting outside with a friend and my 7 year old daughter when my friend pointed out something in the sky moving at a slower speed it looked as if it was on fire could have been a plane on fire but there were other planes in the distance that it could not be it went right over us and continued until it just hovered then disappeared my daughter was so afraid she was crying as she nor i nor my friend could make it out never seen anything like it in my whole life was pretty scary I'm am really upset that i didn't get it on video or get a picture all devices were in the house i didn't want to miss one second because i just couldn't believe my eyes.;43.694489925373;-79.5742656716416
