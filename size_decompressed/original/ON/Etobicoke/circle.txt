SOLID WHITE LIGHT THAT CHANGED TO MULTI COLOUR LIGHT OVER TORONTO CANADA;2007-01-27 23:10:00;30 seconds;SOLID WHITE LIGHT THAT CHANGED TO MULTI COLOUR LIGHT OVER TORONTO CANADA Some cloud cover, the temp was -3 deg. Celsius winds out of the west south west @ 12 km/h  I was looking towards the North West having my last cigarette for the night and I noticed a solid round white light coming towards me.  It seemed to be approx. 10 to 15 thousand feet high.  It changed direction going east.  As it turned going east the light changed to a multi colour (red, white) lights, it seemed to be flashing.  This may sound like a plane but for it to go across the sky within 20 to 25 seconds seems to be quite fast. If you were to put your arm facing up with a fist it would be 8 or 9 across. I am pretty sure a plane does not changed from a white non flashing light to a multi colour lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
