like watching a little kid dancing around a parent.;2009-07-08 23:30:00;1:30;I live near the airport and was watching the night planes from my balchony and noticed one with extremely dim lights.  the pattern was normal (three in front two on the tail) when they split into two seperate craft. the two lights began swinging around the three(triangle shape) and passing over top of them.  they never deviated their course. it was like watching a little kid dancing around a parent.  then they cruised out of sight over my building.  fairly high maybe 17 - 25000 ft. no sound. lights so dim i could barely make them out.;43.694489925373;-79.5742656716416
Possible ORB in sky?;2020-04-19 22:30:00;1.2 hours;Possible ORB in sky? Approximately 10:30 at night my boyfriend and I were looking out our apartment window to see if an object I had been seeing for the last two and a half week. At first I thought it was just a large star but upon finally getting the curiosity on 04/19/20 to zoom in I seen it was not.. its more of a ball of energy it seems. It will come around 10pm every night and by 11:30 it starts to drift away towards the North/ North west. I got several videos and photos.;43.694489925373;-79.5742656716416
