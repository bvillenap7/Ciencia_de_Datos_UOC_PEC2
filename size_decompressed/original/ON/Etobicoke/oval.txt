Lights in Oval Formation over Etobicoke;2019-07-15 21:20:00;5 minutes;Lights in Oval Formation over Etobicoke Looking west in the evening sky I saw what at first appeared to be an (one) oval, bright, cloud formation which did not seem to fit in with the rest of the sky.  I took a picture so that I could zoom in a bit better.  The image clearly shows an organized oval, not a mish mash of clouds, with what appears to be lights on the outer edge.  The formation seems to blend into the changing clouds to disappear - not dissipate as one would expect of a cloud formation.;43.694489925373;-79.5742656716416
