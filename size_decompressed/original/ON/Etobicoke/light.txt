Mysterious light seen over Lake Ontario;2004-09-04 23:00:00;15 seconds;Mysterious light seen over Lake Ontario A couple of friends and i had gone down to the beach on Lake Ontario in Etobicoke to get a better view of the Symphony of Fire presented by the Canadian National Exhibition each year on the Saturday night of the Labour day weekend.  As we sat in our chairs on the beach looking out over the water, i noticed what looked like a semi-bluish light out over the lake (looking at the lake, it seemed to be about 100 ft up or so), almost the size of a distant plane.  But i then noticed it moved quickly from side to side and was able to stop instantly.  I gave my head a shake because at first i thought my mind was playing tricks on me, but then i saw it again, it moved to the left, and then on an angle down into the water.  I got the words Hey did you guys see... out of my mouth and a girl i was with interrupted me and said that blue light moving around in the sky?.  I was stunned.  We both have no clue what it was, did anyone else see this light in the sky? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));43.694489925373;-79.5742656716416

The answer, I said in my head was because they are communicating/responding to something on the moon.  When I turned to the sky to ponder, I saw a bright orange light move up and down quite easily and knew immediately it was a craft of some sort.  I turned to tell my friends to look at it, turned back and of course it was gone.  Ten minutes past and I looked up again and saw the same orange light hovering in the sky.  This time as I turned to tell my friends to look up into the sky the light in the sky dimmed as you would dim a living room light, and when I told them to look of course it was too late again for them to see.  It makes me believe that some sort of mental connection must be there to view or notice these ufos. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
