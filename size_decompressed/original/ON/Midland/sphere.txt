On the evening of November 17th, my boyfriend and myself witnessed at first 2 bright orange orbs floating in the sky appearing to stay the same distance apart the entire time.  A third orb came into vision, again the exact same distance apart from the other two orbs, all the same bright glowing orangish colour.   We were driving down our small town street watching these orbs just BE in the sky, we turned the corner to get to my home still watching these orbs in amazement, knowing they were not aircraft, meteors, satellites or any other man made object and of course, I did not have my camera with me !! As we arrived at my home the orbs seem to come closer to my backyard, still glowing, still the same distance apart. I ran inside, grabbed my camera, ran into the back yard (literally 10 seconds) and they were gone, simply vanished, no where to be seen in the vast sky above, no where! I can not wait to see them again, I will be ready for you, whoever you are :);44.7529;-79.8865999999999
