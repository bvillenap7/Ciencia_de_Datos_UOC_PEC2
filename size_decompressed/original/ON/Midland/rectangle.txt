Rectangular shaped, dark, rough or irregular shaped underbody,rounded edges with one dim amber coloured light on each side.;2012-08-15 23:45:00;3 seconds;Rectangular shaped, dark, rough or irregular shaped underbody, rounded edges with one dim amber coloured light on each side. This sighting did not occur in Midland but at a nearby campground named six mile lake. As the campfire slowly died I began to notice that the sky was clear and full of stars. As I continued to gaze upward for maybe five minutes, suddenly this dark object flies over me about 50 to 80 feet above the trees. It was not moving super fast, maybe 80 klm an hour, so I was able to get a good look at it. It was about the size of a small school bus. It was rectangular in shape,not square,with rounded edges.The underbody was rough looking,not smooth,and it had 2 very dim lights.One on each end that looked amber like the coals in the fire.It made absolutely no sound. There was no smoke trail, no wind,nothing. To be honest with you,it looked like a flying rock,and no I wasn't drinking and I don't use drugs.So believe it or don't believe it,but I know what I saw and that's good enough for me. I'm 51 years of age, married with 2 young daughters. I currently work as grounds keeper at a local resort. Never seen anything like this before.
