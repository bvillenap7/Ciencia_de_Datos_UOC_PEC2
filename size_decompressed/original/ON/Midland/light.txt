Zig Zagging Light in the night sky.;2002-08-02 23:00:00;7 seconds;Zig Zagging Light in the night sky. I was up north with some friends and as we were sitting around outside the cottage, I was staring up into the sky marvelling at the beauty of the stars. I live in Toronto so when I do manage to get away from the light pollution I try to take it all in.  What I saw was this a light that closely resembled that of a bright star zig zag from one end of the horizon to the next. The light was moving at too fast a speed to be a satellite, and the zigs and zags must have cleared miles of sky judging from how far up the light appeared to be. I followed the light for as long as I could before losing it over the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

three lights like a low flying plane Midland, Ontario, Canada;2002-08-06 23:00:00;30 seconds;three lights like a low flying plane Midland, Ontario, Canada I was stargazing on a beach on Midland Bay, which is part of Georgian Bay and Lake Huron.I had just put down my binoculars when I noticed a light in the sky.  At the time of this observance I was working in a factory in very close proximity to Pearson International Airport (Toronto), in fact the factory was pretty well right under the flight path for landings, so I had seen a lot of planes approaching the airport.  When I noticed the light in the sky I brushed it off as being a plane landing. then I realized where I was and that There was no airport close by. My curiosity peaking, I began to pay more attention to this light.  The object that I observed looked kind of looked like a triangle with three lights. As I observed, the lights grew really bright and then started to fade. The light faded untill it was as bright, and as large as a star in the sky. At this point it began to move in SE direction and it was picking up speed. I reached for my binoculars so that I could follow it, but as soon as I grabbed the binoculars the object was gone.
