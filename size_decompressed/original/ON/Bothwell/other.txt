Red metallic object,seen above the tree line, stationary in the sky.;1974-06-01 14:00:00;5 minutes;Red metallic object,seen above the tree line, stationary in the sky. In the summer (I don’t remember which month) of 1974 about 20 miles or so North of the farm where I grew up in SW Ontario, my fiancé and I, along with another couple were out for a Sunday drive along a popular scenic back road, that ran along one of the county rivers. The fellas were in the front and myself and my friend were in the back.  I was talking to my friend, and past her, out her window, I saw this huge red thing in the sky, just over the tree tops. It was just sitting there like it was parked. I mumbled something like “what is that?” and my friend looked in the same direction and she mumbled pretty much the same thing.  We couldn’t take our eyes off it.  I don't know how long we looked at it, but because we were still moving down the road, after a while it became obscured by the trees along the river and we couldn’t see it anymore. My friend and I yelled “stop” and asked if we could back up? We kept backing up to where we thought we saw it, but the object was nowhere to be seen.  We thought the guys up front were seeing the same thing but it turned out they were oblivious to our conversation and didn’t see a thing.  I confirmed with my friend exactly what she saw and she saw the same thing I did.  It was big, and red and looked dirty, like rusting iron. It was not smooth, but had angles and shadows that looked like big doors.  On the side of it near the back, there was a round hole and from helping my Dad fix farm machinery, I remembered thinking that must be the exhaust, because there were black smudges running down, underneath the hole.  I guess because they didn't see it, the guys teased us relentlessly so we just shut up about it and haven't spoken since about it.  If anyone else has seen something similar, it would be good to know.;42.6262;-81.8718
