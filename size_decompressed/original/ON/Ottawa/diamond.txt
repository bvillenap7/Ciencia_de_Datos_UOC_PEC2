I went to my bedroom to get something and i visited my plant which is a just right beside by the window.  I looked by the window tried to check how much is the layer of ice in my neighbors roof  anyhow i looked up the sky I saw these bright object stagnant in the sky I was kinda shocked I was thinking it may be one of the planets its sparkling to much that I called my husband to ask if what planet might it be.  then i noticed its not 1 but 5 of them scatterred but not so much you can all of them in my window them 1 star moved horinzontally i was shocked i thought it was faked and thought i might have seen a drone instead my husband said yeah it may be a drone but we think it almost up in the sky for so long and we dont know if its really capable to stand for so long. anyhow I tried to look and search any sightings here in Ottawa through internet but it seems none.  until i stumbled to you tube video with these URL: https://youtu.be/pijFz88PxL0    it was 2013 but looking at it its same experience i had.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
