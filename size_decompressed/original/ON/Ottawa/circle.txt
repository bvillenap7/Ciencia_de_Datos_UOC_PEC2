While returning home about midnight in mid summer 1975, I turned the corner in a suburban district of Ottawa and I say a spherical object about a meter in diameter hovering about 3 meters above the center of the street.  The object was bobbing around slightly and it surface seemed to be radiating multi-coloured light that was rotating around its perimeter.  The light was of very pure colors of orange, blue, red and white and seemed to be rotating in patches all over its surface.  I stopped to observe it for a few seconds and then began to approach slowly in my vehicle.  I got to within about 60 feet and the object began to rise slightly and move off toward the right side of the street.  It floated behind a tree and between two houses in the direction of the next street over.  I went around the block and once again saw it hovering above the middle of the next street.  This time as I approached slowly, it moved immediately in the same manner and direction without letting me get closer than about 150 feet.  Once again it floated between houses in the direction of the next street.  Again I went around the block and for a third time it was hovering over the middle of the street.  This time I accelerated towards it and it took off like a shot.  I have been present at military live fire trials at night where tracer rounds were being fired and this object moved considerably faster than a bullet.  It was out of sight in a fraction of a second.  I have never seen anything move that fast.  There was no noise or any other affect that I could sense from this object.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

Bright light and pinwheel pattern appears in the sky,;2001-09-30 22:00:00;2-5 minutes;Bright light and pinwheel pattern appears in the sky, The night was clear. My friend and I were on Cambridge st. at Somerset when we heard a loud distant boom high up. Almost as a sonic boom with no echo. At which point, I looked up to the sky and notice a light brighter than a flare but heavier with a much larger volume shining at a point (similar to magnesium oxide strips) with a huge trail of smoke billowing and gathering in huge amounts above it. It seemed like an object moving at a phenomenal rate of speed towards our general area. Probably far from us.  I observed it long enough to determine it's size and speed as being quite extraordinary. I looked around neightbouring areas in the sky, noticing multiple trails of smoke starting from a center in a bike wheel pattern. The center moved away from where I had spotted the bright light. I looked back at where I saw the object and it was gone. The centerpoint pattern continued for some time until it dissipated.  Here's what my friend has to say.: Ok let me start of by saying I did not see the part of the event as aforementioned by my friend, but we both heard the loud bang, I thought something very large had exploded. When I looked up to the sky I saw what looked like a hole in the atmosphere, a huge round circle in the sky, bright green and possibly blue in colour patterned like the lines of an iris as in the coloured part of the human eye. It was as if there was a puncture in the sky. All I know is It felt out of place and completely unatural. Hope we aren't alone in seeing this event, Loosely speaking we are uncertain if this happened in the fall of 2001-2002. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Round disc seen heading north over East Ottawa Canada, Beechwood area May 25 18:30;2008-05-25 18:30:00;3 min;Round disc seen heading north over East Ottawa Canada, Beechwood area May 25 18:30 We were sitting on a deck facing North, looking across a creek with greenspace/park area, with Beechwood Cemetery in the distance a clear sunny beautiful evening, slightly breezy.  A black/dark grey round something appeared above the cemetery fairly high in the sky, changing it's axis and then steadied itself parallel to the ground and moved at a constant rate (fairly fast) and in a straight line north until it was out of sight.  We thought it was a bird but there was no flapping and it was faster than a bird, and a round, disc.  We don't know what it was, it wasn't a balloon because it didn't continue to go higher, and it didn't adjust it's speed to the wind, fast then slow or vary in direction like a balloon or kite.  I would say it was about 2500-3000 feet in altitude I don't know what it was, just what it wasn't.  It was not silver, had no lights, no crest or hump shape in the center that we could see, but then we were not looking at it horizontally, but at an upward diagonal direction.  I would be interested if anyone else saw it.  One airplane jet passed shortly after, <3 minutes later, not in pursuit though, but across it's flight path, after it was gone.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

Ottawa Drone Flying High Speeds - Orange and White Near The Canadian Security Intelligence Services Building;2013-07-15 00:30:00;3:11;Ottawa Drone Flying High Speeds - Orange and White Near The Canadian Security Intelligence Services Building The object was flying very fast up, down, side to side.  The colors were white and orange. There was only one object flying.   We were looking from the 17th floor of an apartment building outside and the disk was flying near the Canadian Security Intelligence Service of Canada Headquarters.  It was hovering at times.  I honestly believe it was a drone since at night time is when it happens.  I could not believe my eyes and have pictures and a video to prove.   It wasn't a normal commercial aircraft flying at slower speeds with red lights flashing.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
