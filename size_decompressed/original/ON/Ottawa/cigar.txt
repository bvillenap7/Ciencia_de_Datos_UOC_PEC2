Bright elongated object traverses sky;2004-06-15 20:45:00;3 min;Bright elongated object traverses sky Noticed a bright object high in the sky. It was slightly longer than an airplane fuselage yet tapered at each end. There were no wings or tell tale signs of such (such as dark areas around it's mid section). It glowed or shone silver white. I ran towards an elderly couple on a park bench close by. I pointed it out to them and they came into the clearing to get a clear view. They both saw it too. The lady said she had seen it before (I didn't ask when). They both agreed that it was not an airplane. I put forward the notion that perhaps it was a meteor but dismissed it myself as it left no trail nor did it appear to be moving as fast as one would expect a meteor to. It stayed on a steady course heading west at a somewhat leisurely pace comparable to an aircraft at 30,000 feet. It seemed to flare when it was about 60 degrees above the western horizon, growing brighter for a second. I lost sight of it shortly after as it got further away and trees obstructed my view.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
