These are my actual notes I wrote on the evg. of the event. This evening at approx. 8:47pm  EST. I noticed a bright object in the skies. This is the case. I was looking at the Southern evening sky from the 20th floor downtown. I noticed an elongated bright yellow/white object (football field size) moving East at approx. Moving 350-400 MPH.  Altitude was approx. 40-50,000 FT, 20-30 miles South West of the Ottawa Airport. I stared at the object for approx. 30-40 seconds then I stood to get a better view from the balcony. When I looked up it was gone and it never appeared again.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
Light high in sky resolves to non-satellite at closest approach.;2014-09-06 19:30:00;1 minute;Light high in sky resolves to non-satellite at closest approach. Watched as a point source light advanced from west to near vertical position above me. There were a few scattered wisps of cloud that didn't block the light from shining through.  As I watched, the light seemed to fall back every few blinks.  I studied it closer and saw what appeared to be six lights marking a rectangular shape,  3 brilliant red,  elongated lights per side.  The lights blinked in a pattern of forward most, middle,  then furthest,  first one side then the other and repeated.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
