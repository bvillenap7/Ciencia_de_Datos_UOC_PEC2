Looking throught my window I saw Flashing lights I went to look and object was flying around, up and down.  Thought it was an aircraft but it had flashing blue light, it went down and never came up back. Got curious what it did, spent the last ten minutes looking if I would see it again but never.  No ever believe me when I see things, which happen before so why not post it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I watched it move slowly for about a minute.  At first I thought it was the space station but than I saw a airplane coming towards it.  That is when it shot of in another direction.  The orange light turned off and I could see a random set of lights(always changing patterns) moving off behind me at speeds that I have never seen an aircraft move.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
a skinny horizontal Oval with two white light segements on each side, taking up the majority of each side.;2011-06-21 19:30:00;2 mins;a skinny horizontal Oval with two white light segements on each side, taking up the majority of each side. My father and i were driving back from getting a cup of tea from Tim Hortons, as approaching the street we live on my dad said, What's that in the sky?   We both looked up we were speechlesss, because as you are seeing it all the reasonable words that come to mind are immediately wrong, and your'e completely baffled.   It was a horizontal oval with a strong outline against the cloudly sky, with two segements of white light on each side, taking up the majority of each side.  Sadly, it was just above the tree tops, and as we drove toward it, it was lost by sight because of the tall trees, even after we backed up and drove around all the sights that would let that same area of the sky been seen, we still could only see sky.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
Three orange lighting objects came from south to north at the sky all over Ottawa and went away.;2012-10-20 19:20:00;15 minutes;Three orange lighting objects came from south to north at the sky all over Ottawa and went away. The sky was dark and clean. I saw three objects flying in the sky to east of Ottawa.  The angle between their position and the zenith was about 50º.  They came from south to north. The first one came around 19:15.  The second one came around 19:25 minutes later and the third one came around 19:28.  There was a very intense orange light that came from their bottom in an oval form.  Each one remained at the sky about 1-3 minutes.  I could not see when the first one had gone, but the second and the third ones went away as if they were getting more distant and their light was dying.  I’m not sure if there were others objects between the first and the second one because I didn’t keep looking at this time.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

Big bright white light with pulsating red-circle light in center crosses horizon going from West to East.;2016-09-11 00:05:00;5 minutes;Big bright white light with pulsating red-circle light in center crosses horizon going from West to East. Sunday, Sept 11, 2016, 12:05 AM, Ottawa, Ontario, Latitude: 45°18'N. Longitude: 75°39'W.  I woke up about midnight and went over to the bedroom window to adjust the venetian blind.  I saw a bright light in the sky, much bigger than any star, about 10 degrees above the horizon.  It seemed to be somewhat horizontally oblong in shape and not moving at first.   Then it started moving, slowly at first, then picking up speed, going from West to East.  Finally, it crossed the visible horizon and going at quite a clip, it seemed to be about one or two miles away.  It wasn't going much faster than a small airplane not too far away.  But the light was much bigger that would be attached to any airplane which usually has more than one light.  The window was open but there was no sound.  There are small airplanes and helicopters that fly over all the time but I have no trouble hearing them even when the window is closed.  It was not possible to discern any definite outline since the object was shinning so bright.  The main oblong light was white with a slight bluish tint.  There was also and just a tiny bit smaller, and more perfectly round, red light, that pulsed on and off about once every second, in the middle of the object.  There have been previous sightings by myself in this area of the sky.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
Sat. evening in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada at precisely 21:31hrs.  Driving my regular city bus route along a dark resid;2017-03-11 21:31:00;4-5 seconds;Saturday evening in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, at precisely 21:31hrs., I was in service driving my regular city bus route along a dark residential neighborhood.  I then noticed at the top of my windshield an unusual glow coming from the southwest sky heading towards the north east. At that time, I thought it was a comet or a meteor crossing the atmosphere, but it occurred to me that it was way to close to earth be neither one of those two. Then the object slowed down.  I immediately came to an abrupt stop with my bus to have a better look at this object and realize it was definitely out of this world. When I started to focus more on the object I saw that it was a teal colour.  It was an oval shaped and had a transparent see through look to it.  Very strange.  To try an describe it to the best of my knowledge it was basically like looking at a firefly you see in the woods glowing at night, but this object had a constant glow to it and did not flicker off like a firefly. After quickly glancing at the object, it then pickup up at a phenomenal speed and dashed out to the north east sky and it was gone.  The speed that it took off was absolutely phenomenal, just mindboggling.  It's as if it went into warp mode, like in Star Trek. Absolutely something I will never forget for the rest of my days. Just to be clear this all happened from the time I first saw the object to when it disappeared was in the matter of 3 to 5 seconds.  I had no witnesses on board as I had just finished dropping off a group of teenagers a few minutes prior to my experience.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
