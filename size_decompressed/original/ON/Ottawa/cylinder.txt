It was quite high and traveling from west to east. I have seen alot of planes pass by the sky above me but this was no plane. It looked like a passenger plane without wings. The odd thing was that I could not see it in my Canon XL-1S camera. My girlfriend said it was a plane but she wasn't sure, we could see any wings. We looked at it through these really cheap binoculars and there was no way to confirm or convince us that it was a plane. It was cylindre in shape, and white in color. There weren't any windows or lights we could see. It just flew by. I was conviced this was the real thing and the fact I couldn't pick it up on camera was weird. J.

Cylnder;2007-01-24 12:25:00;About 4 minutes;Cylnder Noted an odd object in the sky.  A cylindrical object, which appeared white, but seemed translucent was seen with no clouds in the sky at all.  The object moved fast initially then slowed down for a little over 3 minutes.  The object then rapidly gained velocity and streaked across half the sky in about 20 to 30 seconds.  The object didn’t just drop in altitude since the size decreased as it was moving across the sky.  The object was extremely bright in the noon day sun.  Not the entire cylinder just a line that went down the entire body length.  Basically the closest part to my eye.  The object was brightest when it was highest in the sky.  When it made its closest approach to the sun overhead it was difficult to look at, I needed to squint.  As the object traveled away from the sun the object became less brilliantly lit up, in fact dramatically. The object appeared to pass over a 737 as it was travelling the 737 visually appeared about 10 millimeters long for reference.  I have no idea how close it passed by.  I couldn’t make out if the object had any wings.  The cylinder appeared to be about 1 unit in diameter and 15 units long. I just want to know if anyone else noticed this object, as well if anyone could identify the object as a known aircraft.  Does this object relate to any anomalous weather behavior.  If someone knows something please post. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

Everything just felt off. It wasn't flapping, it wasn't a plane (I could clearly see it) it was a pill-shaped thing of no specific colour just clipping west to east traversing the entire sky in about 30 seconds.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
