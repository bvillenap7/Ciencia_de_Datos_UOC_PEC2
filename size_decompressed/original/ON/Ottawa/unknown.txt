an object travelling at an alarming speed across the sky;2005-07-06 19:10:00;20-30seconds;an object travelling at an alarming speed across the sky As my girlfriend and I were sighning up for volunteer work, I noticed a streak of light going across the sky at a very alarming speed. It was travelling from east to west in a straight line starting at the horizon to my right and was going at a speed I'm sure that no jets can possibly fly at. Unable to determine how high it was, the city skyline in that direction was very clearand there were few clouds in the sky.  Although there was commercial traffic, it seemed to be higher and much much faster.As it neared  the end of the horizon it seemed to just go out of sight.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
Quiet strange large lights hovering in the sky;2006-02-02 20:10:00;1 minute;Quiet strange large lights hovering in the sky I was driving back home on Heron Road.  I noticed lights in the sky but they looked strange.  I see planes often because I live near an airport but it was too big and had too many lights to be one.  And it was also quite low and it wasn't moving.  It was almost like hovering.  I tried to get a better view but I was driving.  Then it started moving slowly north.  This thing I saw had white and red lights.  It looked just like a row of lights but it was very long.  There were for sure two bigger red lights in the middle...I can't remember if there was a third one in the centre and a bit higher then the other two red lights.  Then there were a bunch of smaller white lights on the sides lined up beside the red lights.  So basically it looked like straight white lights on the endsand in the centre were the red lights.  I couldn't tell the shape of this object because it was dark.  All I saw were the lights and they were just a straight line.  And it was big and quite low.  It had too many lights to be a plane.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
Object multiple lights, different colors, following us.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting perhaps solved.  Kite with LED lights.  PD));2014-09-16 20:00:00;1 hour;Object multiple lights, different colors, following us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness sent a note on March 19, 2015, suggesting that the sighting was the result of a nearby kite with different-colored LED lights.  Link to video provided below.  PD)) My mother and I (and our dog) left the house around 8PM to walk the dog and go to the store.  I noticed a red pulsing light between some houses across the street from our place, around the corner.  I mentioned it to my mother and then I lost sight of it. Once we approached the main road, we saw the light again, across the street from us, high enough up.  From that distance it looked to be about the size of a nickel, sometimes appearing to grow to the size of a quarter and sometimes a little bigger.  I noticed it seemed to follow us, so we stopped moving to make sure.  When we stopped moving, it was ahead of us, but moved back toward us.  If we stood still to watch it a while, we noticed multiple lights and different colors (red, blue, green, white, yellow and purple).   It also seemed to pulse at regular intervals, as if to convey some kind of code.  It moved up, down, sideways, go around in a circle, backwards and then would do some type of movement which looked like it was riding a wave. It in fact did follow us all the way to the store and back home again, until we lost sight of it. Note:  I did see something similar on 09/12/2014 while driving up to the country, I first saw it on one side of the car, seemingly following the same path, then lost sight of it, then saw it again on the other side of the car for a while until I couldnâ€™t see it anymore.   The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) To whom it may concern,  I feel pretty silly about all of this but a few days ago, I found a video on Youtube showing an LED kite which apparently, some students from Rideau High School in Ottawa were flying a few streets down from my place, on the very same night I thought I saw a UFO (09/16/2014).  Here is the video I saw:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEwCBT-1KsI From this video, it's pretty obvious that the object seen is NOT a UFO, but from my perspective and location it looked rather blurry in the distance and moved oddly and could have easily been mistaken for a UFO or something other than a kite.  It definitely looked nothing like what you see in the video but exhibited the same colors.  That is why I I feel pretty confident that what we see in this video must be what I saw - same night around the same time.  I still feel pretty silly.  The only thing I can't account for is the red light, which, like I said, had followed a friend and I on a country road a few days before.   Thank you for your time  Honestly,   ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
Pulsating bright white and blue light darting in different directions and specific patterns.  ((NUFORC Note:  Arcturus??  PD));2016-04-08 21:45:00;2.5 hours;Pulsating bright white and blue light darting in different directions and specific patterns. Observed object similar to a star but much brighter. Pulsating smaller blue light.  During hours of observation the object traveled for short distances on the diagonal, back and forth, up and down and backwards and forwards.  It also made a flourish, much like an 8, sideways, but not joined up.  It actually made a perfect square as well!   Two airplanes came by and each time, the object remained still until the plane was out of proximity. It actually was so bright that it formed an aura around itself, and I could see l clouds pass by. It should be noted that it has been there every subsequent night up until last night, August 15th!  It is positioned toward the tail end of the handle of the Big Dipper, to the south of it. Each night it has been at the same co-ordinates. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the description is not inconsistent with a regular sighting of the star, Arcturus, seen over several nights.  PD));45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
Orange Lights - Out of This World.;2016-04-17 21:45:00;30 seconds;Orange Lights - Out of This World. I was walking my dog for his last of the evening.  I looked towards the moon, whereas Jupiter was in close proximity.  Above, as though it came out from behind Jupiter, orange lights which seemed to possibly be attached, since they moved in uniform together travelled from south/east to north/west at a very rapid pace.   At first glance, I believed I was watching separate lights, unattached, since I was unable to see anything in the middle holding them together.  There were 9-12 in total orange round lights.   I was not under the influence of alcohol or any drugs/medication, nor was I tired.  My heartbeat raced. I've never seen anything like this before.  The mass of the lights were tremendously large, as well there was no sound or echo, having me come to the conclusion, the unit was not directly in earth's atmosphere.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
