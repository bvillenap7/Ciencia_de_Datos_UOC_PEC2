This occurred on the Military air base formally known as Uplands Airforce Base, and while walking to an early morning hockey pratice I decided to look for stars to take my mind off being alone in the dark. I suddenly saw a very low, very bright,silent object with 3 blacked out rhombus shaped (windows??) approaching me a very high rate of speed. The object suddenly came to a complete stop right in front of me over a large tree approximately 200 AGL. It appeared to just stop and take notice of me in my hockey gear and hovered silently for about 20 sec and then at an incredible speed left at about a 45 degree angle towards some clouds and just disappeared. It was initially flying to the best of my knowledge, down the military flight line from the International side of the airport.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
This happened more than 10 years ago so the details are sketchy. I'm also not sure if it was in 1990 or 1991.;1990-09-30 18:00:00;3-4 minutues;This happened more than 10 years ago so the details are sketchy. I'm also not sure if it was in 1990 or 1991. It was very early evening, still light, and as I stopped at a stop sign on a fairly busy suburban throroughfare, I noticed what I thought was stadium lights on some spare ground that was being made into a park, about 100 feet to my right. Instead of stadium lights, there was a large metal, flattened ovoid-disc, machine(?) hovering just above the trees. No noise. I'm not good at judging size but I'd guess it was around 40-60 feet in diameter. It had a ring of very bright lights circling its lower rim. As I continued very slowly along beside it, it moved, also slowly and very smoothly, in the same direction. It moved with facility and seemed not to be labouring under its own weight. This continued for about a quarter mile. It was slowly gaining altitude but continued on the same path. The road I was on began to veer away from our mutual direction but I watched it until it disappeared from view, as a plane would. What I find stunning about this is that there were many cars on the road. The other travellers must have seen it - it was unmissable - but none of us did what one would expect folk to do under such circumstances, jump out of our cars and point and gawk. I never heard anything about it in local media. I can say with conviction that it was not a helicopter, an aircraft or a blimp. Dunno! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It wasn't a hot-air balloon it was a saucer-like metallic object that was slowly turning on its side.;2003-08-14 16:30:00;2-3 minutes;It wasn't a hot-air balloon it was a saucer-like metallic object that was slowly turning on its side. On Thursday, August 14, 2003, the day of the great power black-out of 2003, at approximately 4:30 p.m., I was walking towards the Byward Market area with (name withheld), a fellow (worker) at the (workplace). We were on our way to the pub. We had been walking North on MacKenzie Street and made for the steps between the Connaught Building and the United States Embassy. As I was walking down the steps, I noticed what looked like a hot air balloon in the sky straight ahead of us, i.e. looking East and down George Street. (Note: it is quite common to see hot air balloons over the Ottawa sky. It would be unusual to see them at that time of day however. They usually appear around 6:00 or 6:30 p.m.)  When I glanced back at it a few seconds later – now having crossed Sussex Drive and walking on the North sidewalk of George St., I noticed the object’s strange behaviour: changing shape, which a hot air balloon does not do.  I tried to get (name withheld) to check it out but by the time I got him to look up, it had disappeared from view behind some buildings. I then figured out why its shape was changing: it was a saucer-like object that was slowly turning on its side, tipping one way then returning to an upright position only to tip on its other side. It was possibly 10 to 20 meters in diameter and perhaps 3-5 meters in height. It was red and dull-grey steel. I think the centre dome-part was red and the rest of it was dull-grey. When I first saw the object, it was about 500-600 meters away and at an altitude of about 150-200 meters. It made no noise, had no blinking lights and did not leave any type of trail in the sky.  When we rounded the corner of Williams Street, we both saw the object in the sky moving due North at a relatively low speed that I would estimate to be between 50-70 km/h. BY then it was about 1 kilometer away. I had a digicam but did not choose to use it because by then the object was pretty far away and it would have probably appeared as a small dot on a picture.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
What I first thought was a hot air balloon suddenly changed shape to reveal itself as a saucer overflying the heart of Canada's capital;2003-08-21 16:30:00;20-30 seconds;What I first thought was a hot air balloon suddenly changed shape to reveal itself as a saucer overflying the heart of Canada's capital (Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA) On Thursday, August 21, 2003, at approximately 4:30 p.m., I was walking towards the Byward Market area with a friend, a fellow worker.  We had been walking North on MacKenzie Street and made for the steps between the Connaught Building and the U.S. Embassy.  As we were walking down the steps, I observed what looked like a hot air balloon in the sky straight ahead of us, i.e. looking East down George Street. When I glanced back at it a few seconds later, I noticed the object’s strange behaviour: changing shape, something that a hot air balloon does not do, obviously.  I tried to get my friend to check it out but by the time he turned to look, it had disappeared from view. I, on the other hand, had by then understood why its shape was changing: it was a disc-like object that had revolved on itself to look like a saucer on its side (note: perhaps the occupants wanted their “craft” to appear as a “hot air balloon”). It was 15 to 20 m. in diameter and around 4-5 m. in height. It was dark red. This is why I first thought it was a red hot air balloon since these are fairly common in our area, especially in August. When I first saw the object, it was about 400-500 m. away and at an altitude of about 20-25 m. (note: this estimate is based on the position of the object as it came very near a building that was about four stories high). For the couple of seconds I believed it was a hot air! balloon, I even thought it might crash or land atop a building because I had “rationalized” that it was part of a radio station stunt arranged with the Hard Rock Cafe, the rooftop terrace of which the object was approaching. When we rounded the corner of Williams Street, my friend and I both saw the object in the sky moving North. It was then about 1 km. away and not moving very fast. Unfortunately, it was too far away for my friend to tell what it was. Please note that the above report is a revised version of the initial report I submitted to NUFORC in August 2004, a year after the sighting.  That report inexplicably disappeared from the NUFORC database some time this year.  I have revised the date of the sighting since I had, at first, mistakenly thought that the event occurred during the famous power outage of August 14, 2003, but I was later corrected by the friend who was with me at the time.  I also made changes to the dimensions of the object as it did have dimensions similar to those of a hot air balloon.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

Was going to shut him up and looked out window to see what he was barking at. Shocked to see a large well lit top-shaped object flying west to east over our farm and just south of our house heading over the rideau river. was too upset to wonder what it was. just stared. object was well lit in relief by the full moon behind it. originally thought dog must be barking at the moon but he never really barks and being a bulldog really can't that well ... its a lot of effort for him and he is always quiet which is why i even got up to see what he was on about.  I would guess the object was quite large, quite high up - 2000 feet? - could not really tell - was large ... object was greyish where the moon was illuminating it - definitely darker than the surrounding sky, had many bright lights on bottom in rings - random big square yellowish lights - and had a few red lights and other smaller white lights sprinkled over the surface randomly. could not see the top of it from my angle. no lights blinked. object did not spin, windows were wide open last night and object made no noise. moved very slowly eastward. watched it for about 5 to 10 seconds but seemed longer. i was really upset at what i saw .. i remember saying WTF out loud and went to another window on the other side of the bedroom for a better look as tree blocking my view from first window i viewed it from but object did not reappear on other side ... i continued to look for a few more minutes but saw nothing ... my dog stopped barking after i lost sight of the object and i went back to bed. looked at the clock and time was exactly 12:54 am so i saw something at 12:52-53. really upset me to see this, have no idea what it was and i had a lot of trouble going back to sleep. really tired today. searched the internet today to see if anyone else saw something last night and found this site to leave this message.  the object was not a plane - too low for that - shape was all wrong. shaped like a child's top but did not spin .. had a lot of lights on it. it was huge. i could see this really well last night because of the full moon. image is imprinted in my mind and i can't forget it. i am hoping someone on the other side of the river saw it too last night so i know i am not losing my mind! I can still see it;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
Shiny shape suspended  in sky not moving;2009-04-24 19:00:00;1 minute;Shiny shape suspended  in sky not moving My two sisters and I were heading to the movie theater, already a little late for the intended show.  As we turned off the highway, I noticed something shiny in he sky.  It wasn't moving, just hovering in the air, and this is what perked my interest.  It was definitely not a plane as it was not moving.  I'm unable in my knowledge to come up with a rational explanation.  My sister, who was driving, noticed it when I pointed it out, but as she was driving, she had only caught a few brief glimpses of it.  My other sister was as oblivious to it.  As background, we make fun of her for never being able to spot or find anything.  As we were turning off the highway, the object went out of view due to a hill obstructing our quickly changing view.  The object was shiny, glistening high in the sky.  I'm not familiar with the stratosphere or troposphere and find it difficult to describe it's height above ground.  It was high, but within what I would guess is the troposphere.  It was farther in distance from us, across terrain, compared to it's distance above the ground.  Much farther.  The shape wasn't very definitive in form--the closest thing I can compare it to being a polished stone.  I hope that I've included enough information and hope that I'm not wasting your time by sending this.  Thanks.

Orange Glowing disc visible over parliament hill, Ottawa, Canada.;2011-10-05 13:00:00;60 seconds;Orange Glowing disc visible over parliament hill, Ottawa, Canada. Right after waking up on the morning of October 5th, while just causally sitting in bed i took a look out my window and immediately i saw a bright glowing orange disk like structure in the sky towards the east (in direction of parliament hill).  It was hovering for about 30 seconds, pretty low in the sky and appeared to be moving very slowly at first.  Out of curiosity, I got up out of my bed to get a better look, the disk than seemed to have vanished towards the east and was no longer visible in the sky. the object was much larger than a plane - It was a clear sky no clouds or other visible objects in the sky -  The saucer was very bright, Unlike any other structure explainable. the best way i can explain its shape is somewhat a cheeseburger appearance :P;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
Disc shaped blue light on top white and red on the bottom.;2013-01-03 02:55:00;1 minute;disc shaped blue light on top white and red on the bottom It was early Saturday morning I was just coming home from my buddy’s house we had been working on his snow mobile all night I was almost home when I saw this red glow coming from down the road in the swamp area on old almonte road in carp / almonte / Ottawa / west Carleton/ corkery (if this helps pinpoint where I was for you) I decided to drive past my turn to take a look and I see this floating disc now I saw it for about 2 seconds before it took off but it had a flashing blue light on top fairly dim with a bright white light on the bottom and what looked to be this orb of red light coming from the bottom. It moved so quickly like nothing I have ever seen went straight up and did almost a nike swoosh pattern when it took off in the sky but there is no way a helicopter could have landed in this heavily brush area. This craft didn’t make a sound either I had the window down and the radio off and didn’t hear much and what I did hear was no helicopter ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
