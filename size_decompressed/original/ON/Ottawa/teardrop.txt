I cannot fill in the time due to your system not accepting any version I enter. It was 11:15 pm.  The craft was very large (hard to determine the size given the distance is undetermined, perhaps several hundred metres away)  It was luminous silver and green in color and it appeared out of nowhere.  It was not a meteor, nor a comet, as I have seem many over the years.  I have seen several of theses over the last few months, but normally they are silver and it appears they like to hover around the trees in the neighbourhood and in particular, around the parking lot where I live.   Last fall, I saw many orbs, some white some red travelling through the parking lot...no idea what the attraction is in this particular spot.  My husband and I have been seeing ufo's for over 20 years, get the feeling we are being tracked.  We have moved about 10 times in 25 years and yet they continue to appear.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

I was shocked and it went down really fast towards the ground and disappeared.  Sorry for lack of details.  That is all I know.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
