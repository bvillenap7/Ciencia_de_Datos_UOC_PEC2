Well it was pretty strange.I'm sure most of your entries are like this,my girlfriend and i were sitting @ the beach (shirley's bay)in ottawa. Looking up at the stars that evening was fantastic, after viewing the nightsky for about 15 min. i witnessed a light come'n across the horizon,move'n at a quick speed and came to a sudden stop (there was just no way this could of happend, the object was moving way to fast to stop like that) and no sooner did it stop when it took of in a different direction.This was not a reflection of any sort, it was an object of physical property,to this day i wonder........................;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

I turned to point it out to my friends.  Turning back we noticed that the light was moving, not like a satellite.  It at first went down and to the right from Orion, then began moving down towards the horizon, but in a side to side swaying motion.  Possibly it was moving in a helix pattern downward (or away?).  My friend was excited and ran back in the house to get two others, but by the time they came back out it was gone.  3 of us saw it, 2 missed it.  It seemed to be quite far away, and was no brighter than an average star.  Synchronistically, it did happen after i'd been telling them all about ufo's and other strange phenomena.  At the time Orion was perhaps 15 degrees above the horizon.  the event lasted about 30 to 45 s.  (our first sighting :) i would like to hear other reports of the same object.  thank you;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
2 Bright lights over Ottawa,Ont.;2001-05-20 02:00:00;about 2 hours;2 Bright lights over Ottawa,Ont. It was around 2am (est) and we were out offroading when we stoped to look at the stars, since it was a clear night, and we seen this bright orange light hovering over us. at first we thought it was a planet or something but then it started to move up and down  and side to side(it didnt move like a airplane at all). after watching it for awhile we seen light (greenish colour light) come from the woods in front of us.  it was still over us hovering. after awhile watching this thing we seen another bigger and brighter white light to the left of us this one moved in the same way as the first one but it moved alot faster  but it also hovered over us for awhile we watched the big white light get smaller and smaller as it got father away from us  we are guessing that we spent around 2 hours watching these things in the sky ((NUFORC Note:  Our first suspicion is that the witnesses may have been looking at celestial bodies, but that is only a guess.  We suspect that a UFO would probably not hover over Ottawa for two hours, and we receive only one report about the incident.  That is only a supposition, however.

Big bright green light falling from the sky in an arc.... then disappearing;2001-07-11 22:00:00;3 seconds;Big bright green light falling from the sky in an arc.... then disappearing My friend and I were driving on Highway 417 at night when we saw an unusual bright green light in the sky.  It was much bigger than a plane and brighter than a shooting star.  The light was falling from the sky in an arc at an astonishing speed.  Then it just disappeared from sight, even though it was a clear night and nothing was blocking our line of vision.  What stands out the most is how big it was, its bright colour (green), and how fast it was falling before it disappeared.  We reported the sighting to NASA soon after it happened.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

As soon as I got a good fix on it it suddenly drifted straight up, and within ten seconds I could not find it anymore.Before I lost sight of it I am pretty sure it changed to an orangish color. 1.

Light rising in east disappears.;2003-08-13 23:00:00;30 seconds;Light rising in east disappears. While star gazing/meteor watching, noticed a bright light rising about 10 degrees above the eastern horizon, growing brighter/larger perhaps approaching. Trained my binoculars on it to determine if it was an aircraft. Did not see any flashing lights indicative of such nor any structure such as wings. Continued watching it slowly rising (assumed it was nearing) straight up with naked eye until it vanished aprox. 30 degrees above horizon. I scanned the sky in the general vicinity with binoculars for a minute however did not see anything else (I tried to find a dark object association). The light was much larger than a star, maybe 2 times the size of Mars in comparison, perhaps by a factor of 3 or 4 when it vanished.  This is the second time I've noticed such a peculiar object within the last year in the same area of the sky (I can't remember if the last was as recent as this year or not). This is my umpteenth sighting of extraordinary objects over the past 2 1/2 years in this area.  I've had security guard training years ago that taught me much about awareness especially as it pertains to recounting details of situations such as being a witness to an event. I'm a software engineer by profession and know much about writing (designing an application) and debugging programs (systematic attentiveness to finding, fixing and communicating flaws in logical coding constructs amoungst other failures).

I am familiar with most types of commercial and private aircraft since my home falls within normal flight paths of air traffic (incoming and outgoing aircraft) for Ottawa international Airport. The light I saw displayed none of the usual flashing navigational, running, collision lights and moved quickly and steadily from west to east. It was a steady white light, with no pulsing or flashing, no noise and maintained it's course and speed during the entire event. I just checked out Heavens Above.com and a satellite tracking link there and found that what I am 99% sure is what I a saw was the ISS (International Space Station).

Both were orange. My first impression was that it was air craft since I live near one. But the flight path of both objects seemed irratic as they seem to move from one direction to another , left to right , and could change elevation rapidly. Both objects then moved in opposit dirctions and sometimes would come close to each other and repeat the action again. Sight of both objects was lost as they moved out behind some clouds. I looked for as much as 15 more minutes to see if i they could be found again but to no avail.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

My son called me on the Balcony at that point, and together we saw them going trough the clouds in a very smooth random pattern, (following the smaller light that I could not see probably because of the clouds),the movement was smooth and swaying like the course that fishes swimming in a pond would take.  They were easily visible trough the really low clouds, and it was clear that they were not attached to each other, they would come close together and then move apart in a weird ballet.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

I was drive west down old strandherd road when I saw the triangle shaped light appear from the clouds. It stood still then it race south across the sky before disappearing. After about 10 seconds it reappeared where it orignally emerged but then it went north. It stopped and then kept racing back and forth. I stopped thinking it was simply just a powerful light being emitted from the ground after it had been racing back and forth across 120 degree span from where I was watching it. The intensity of the light hadn't changed as it was moving either, so it couldnt have been an image being emitted from the ground because such an image would lose intensity as the light beam stretched further away from the origin. This racing back and across lasted about 10-15 seconds. I almost got in an accident watching it as i slowed down and the guy behind me nearly hit me.

At first we thought it was just the top of a light tower, but then 4 more of the circular light shaped objects appeared.  They didn't seem to be in any order as they were not in a straight line, but they were all spaced apart and different heights.   They did not move at all, but just stayed in the positions that they first appeared in.  They remained for a few minutes, then all but the original one disappeared.  That one remained for another minute or so, and then it disappeared as well.  It was a clear sky with only a few clouds, and the objects were probably only a few hundred feet up in the air.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

My girlfriend and I were just watching TV when I looked outside the patio door.  At first I thought it was a couple of fireworks shot up.  Looked away, but looked right back and realized they weren't falling.  I said what the hell is that?  My girlfriend immediately got up off the sofa and I went out onto our deck and watched them. What were they?  2 orange lights in the sky moving from the Northwest to the Southwest.  They moved very slowly but at an unwavering pace.  Did not make a sound. What was amazing was, the entire time we watched them, they never moved closer or further apart but kept perfect distance from each other.  I would say we watched them for about a good minute to a minute and a half as they passed overhead until we lost sight of them when they passed over to the other side of our building.  They could not have been that high as we could have watched them for a fair bit longer if they were higher. My girlfriend remarked at one point that they kind of looking like floating candles ( the flame of a candle, that sort of colour ).  I thought perhaps they were fighter planes or perhaps helicopters flying in formation but there were no other lights other than that emanating from what could only have been the center of their mass.  Did not detect a real mass or shadow behind them either. In terms of shape round, but more like glowing orbs. In terms of backgrounds, I am a 36 year old lawyer and my girlfriend is a 42 year old medical research assistant. Anyway, pretty amazing we both feel privileged to have witnessed that.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
Green light, then vanished...;2012-02-11 18:30:00;15 seconds;Green light, then vanished... While driving north on highway 416 toward Ottawa, just passing Kemptville, I was noticing how one star to my left was the only one brig enough to be seen from inside the car.  I figured it was Venus, which I've heard is very bright in the winter.  I could not see any other stars. Suddenly, while it was on my left, I noticed a new light over the tree line directly ahead of me to the north.  It was green, and very bright.  There were red lights along the tree line which I knew were tops of cell phone or radio towers.  This green light was well above the red lights - much higher than the red ones.  I thought it was strange, so kept my eye on it until it suddenly disappeared.  There was no visible direction that it went.  It was like it was just turned off, which leads me to believe that it moved off very fast. I didn't see it again.  I confirmed that the star I believed to be Venus was still to my left (west) to be sure I wasn't just seeing it.  Minutes later, I saw a plane fly in the general area I had seen the light. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to draw my wife's attention to the light before it disappeared because I didn't think it was worth pointing out to her until it was too late.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555

They were round lights that would slightly fade in and out of brightness and were moving side to side, up and down, but only slightly because they were fairly far away.

Was driving northbound on Highway 416 (near Kemptville, ON) and noticed 3 red lights high up in the sky looking north towards Ottawa.  The three lights were red and flying in a pattern and looked to be moving independently of one another (as in not fixed to one body).  Lights were in a triangular pattern. Lights would stay solid red (and only red), and then blink out and back in, but not in a regular pattern.  Perhaps solid for 5 seconds, then a blink out, and back on fast.  All three lights would not blink out at the same time, they would alternate irregularly. Thought it was flares at first, but then realized the lights were tracking north.   Likely not a plane as there were three in formation and did not have a plane lighting blink pattern.  Also not the radio towers off along the highway, I could see the towers quite well, this was was higher up in the sky. Lights were not super bright, but did move quickly north towards Ottawa.
