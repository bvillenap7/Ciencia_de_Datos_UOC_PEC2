Around 20:30 I saw a blinking light, similar to strobe light.  At first I assumed it was a plane or a helicopter, but after a minute or so, the light didn't move.  Only the blinking light was visible.  The object was in a clearing between the clouds.  During dusk, it was still pretty bright, so I took my binoculars an looked at the source of light. I saw an object, dark in color, chevron shaped.  Facing me with one side, blinking light in equal time intervals . Looked like the object had the same light on the other side of it. Smaller lights were visible on the bottom of the object, changing colors from green to blue and purple. My wife witnessed the object as well and confirmed the shape and lights. After around 20 min hovering in  the same spot,  70 degrees above the horizon, the object began to move Westbound.;45.3822673389718;-75.7040854261555
