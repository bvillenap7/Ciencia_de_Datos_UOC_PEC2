Two stationary lights suspended over Lake Huron.;2014-08-29 23:30:00;2 hours;Two stationary lights suspended over Lake Huron. From Ipperwash Beach, looking ENE, we observed two single yellow lights suspended in the air, which did not appear to move or change over the course of more than an hour.   The Lake Huron shore and wind turbine farm gave us a proportion confirming they were too high for fixed lighting, and from water reflection, appeared to be over the water.   My husband thought they were Chinese lanterns launched from the beach, but they did not move or die out as expected.;43.1676724137931;-81.8923103448276
