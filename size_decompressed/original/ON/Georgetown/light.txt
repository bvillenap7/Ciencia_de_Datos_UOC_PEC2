high bright red light fast moving;1994-08-01 00:30:00;20 seconds;high bright red light fast moving Worked at a fast-food restaurant and took the garbage out at the end of the night.  I sat on the curb and was looking around as it was a calm warm night, very pleasant.  I was looking up and saw a bright red light, stayed the same brightness, no flashing or pulsing.  It was moving at a great rate of speed moving from South to North.  It seemed very very high but was really bright.  It made no sound and although bright had no blurriness or coronas.  I thought it may have been the Space shuttle or ISS but being red seemed no right.  I stayed there for another while to see if any followed or if it came around again.  I just remember the speed being incredible as it seemed so far away.;43.6514000000001;-79.9143000000001
Quick light bluish-purple light shot across the sky (leaving a sort of bright streak like a comet), and then disappeared;2005-09-09 20:30:00;2 seconds;Quick light bluish-purple light shot across the sky (leaving a sort of bright streak like a comet), and then disappeared I dropped my friend off back home, and while turning around and approaching the highway, I noticed out of the car window to the right in the night sky a bluish-purple light - it was very bright and larger than any star - it almost looked like an oval - it was difficult to tell, because it just SHOT in a streak, sort of downwards - and then completely disappeared. I could tell it wasn't a shooting star, cause I have seen shooting stars, and they are much smaller and don't leave that much of a streak of light. It almost seemed like a comet - except that it flashed almost too quickly for a comet, and the point of light of the object, or whatever it was, was very noticeable. It was distinctly a light purplish blue, and left a faint streak of light of the same colour. I have never seen anything, in my entire life, like it! I never even thought I'd ever manage to see a UFO (or whatever it was) in my own eyes! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
