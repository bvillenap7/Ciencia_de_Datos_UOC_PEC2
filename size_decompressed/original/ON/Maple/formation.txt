Blue-ish glowing formation passing from east to west in Maple, Ontario;2011-06-14 01:20:00;10 seconds;Blue-ish glowing formation passing from east to west in Maple, Ontario At 1:20 am in Maple, Ontario, we saw 1 very large blue-ish formation pass from east to west outside my bedroom window.   It was very close, probably about cloud height.  It went by too quickly to take a picture or react.  I'm not too sure what shape it was as it was more of a glowing blue formation.;43.8503;-79.5128000000002
