BRIGHTER THAN ANY STAR AND DISAPPEARED VERY FAST.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Iridium satellites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ote:  Source of report indicates a flawed date.  We do not know what the date of the sighting was, but we assume that it was in 2007.  We have amended the date above.
