Triangular shaped object with yellow lights hovering above a wooded area and corn field.;2005-03-04 22:30:00;10 minutes;Triangular shaped object with yellow lights hovering above a wooded area and corn field. Driving along a rural road in the wintertime, about 22:30,on the way home from work,my co-worker and I observed a triangular object with yellow lights. It travelled very slowly at a low altitude towards us, just above the tree line. As we neared the object, the object appeared stationery about one mile from the car we were travelling in. We could see more yellow lights -approximately 5 to 6 lights-randomly placed. Stopped vehicle for another look, shut off radio, car continued to idle, observed the object hovering in the north sky for about 5 minutes, above trees. Heard no sound from object and saw no movement Then proceeded to continue driving home, object remained in the same position in the sky until we lost sight of it.;43.1458061068702;-80.7301595419846
