They were randomly speeding up and slowing down, moving side to side, but all stayed relatively close together. As they approached the south horizon, the merged into one brighter light and went away over the horizon.;43.1458061068702;-80.7301595419846

2 bright lights spotted at edge of big dipper;2017-03-21 05:30:00;30 seconds;2 bright lights spotted at edge of big dipper. I was walking to work, walking south to North, the big Dipper was at my 11 o'clock if my walking path was at 12, between and slightly in front of the stars merak and dubhe of the big Dipper constellation 2 very bright yellowish lights appeared, I had just happened to be looking to my left to check for traffic when I saw them appear, one was in front of the other and had the same brightness, they were separated by maybe 2 inches in my field of view from the ground, neither light moved or pulsated, they stayed constantly bright for maybe 30 seconds then both slowly faded away, the sky was cloudless as I could see the big Dipper fully and closer stars around it, these lights were very bright almost resembling a planes landing lights if looked at from head on, but again like I said they did not move, it was hard to tell the altitude, the size of the lights was maybe half the size of a full moon, it was very cool to see and a great way to start my day, if anyone el! se was looking up at the sky at that time in that direction these lights could not be missed, I've never seen anything like that before.;43.1458061068702;-80.7301595419846
