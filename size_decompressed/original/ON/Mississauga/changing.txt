I took about 6 pictures and noticed a light in the sky that was not there a second ago.  I turned on the camera on the phone and recorded the object flying what appeared closer towards me occasionally changing shape to disk (so it appears).  My camera shut off (I think I accidentally pressed button to stop) when I looked back the object was gone. I have reviewed my pictures and found that during my series of shots the object just appeared.  I checked the time stamp of the picture of when the object appeared and it said 9:11 pm.  (little weird). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
