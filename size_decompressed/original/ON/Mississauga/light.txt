Travelled for about 20 seconds, made a 90 degree turn to the north. Travelled north for about 15 seconds, made a 90 degree turn to the east. Was seen for another 10 seconds approx. then disappeared from view. It was 2:51am EDT and I was outside helping my parent's pack their van to go on their trip to Nova Scotia. My dad went inside and I was looking at the stars when I noticed an extremely bright white light heading west at a fast rate of speed. After about 20 seconds, the light made a sharp 90 degree turn to right and headed north. After about 15 seconds of heading north, the light then made another sharp 90 degree turn to the right, heading east. The object then sped up and was out of view after about 10 seconds. I live under flight paths that planes use to go into and out of Lester B. Pearson International Airport, however, the airport is closed at that hour of the night and there had been absolutly no air traffic since about 12:30am.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
Star starts moving and just takes off.;2000-06-01 17:00:00;1 minute;Star starts moving and just takes off. Years ago, I was walking down Lakeshore Rd., just north of Lake Ontario, and looking up at the stars.  It was a clear beautiful night.   I noticed what I thought was a star, at first, but it went from being stationary, to moving.   It moved away in a straight line, towards the southeast, and just took off, until it was gone in a few seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date in 2000 is approximate.

Bright lights turning on and off, planes going above them.;2002-06-25 21:30:00;ongoing;Bright lights turning on and off, planes going above them. Down by the lake with my wife. Extremely bright amber light appeared 10 degrees above horizon, turned on and off rapidly, then stayed on, another light turned on (to the right from ny view point), the light seemed to twist or turn, hard to explain, sort of twisting and flickering (bad description)it turned off immediately, as it disappeared it immediately reappeared just to the left of the first light, it remained there for about twenty seconds, there was a flash and it turned off only to reappear just to the right of its original position. Then all flashed off, we watched for about another five or ten minutes, the main light then popped back on, as soon as it had there were three other lights immediately popped on and then off. These lights were in a triangle formation around the main light as they came on. On a count of about 10 or twelve all four turned off at once. About fifteen or twenty seconds after they all turned off, there was a white and green flash to the right of where the main light was, even though this was quick it had a shape to it. At the present over an hour after the first light popped on, the process is still repeating itself in a seemingly random manner. Our view point when we saw these lights was such that the city of Toronto was on the left of them. I would put them 5~6 miles off the coast and at a height of about 2500 - 3500 feet. The CN tower is a perfect reference for us as it is about 1800 feet high and they were just above its height. The visibility is over 15 miles as we could see the city and also the planes landing at the Island airport. These are not planes, nor are they flares. When we got home we told the kids, they immediately went to look, and I am amazed that the lights are still there. The kids are looking at them at the present through a telescope and binoculars 8x35. They are telling me that planes are passing to the left and to the right, but the lights when they turn on are still in their same location. They seem to turn off for about five or so minutes and th! en pop b ack on. These are not stars or planets nor are they choppers. Through the bino's a vague shape is discernible, I think lozenge shaped best descibes it. Our view from our apartment is facing the same direction, but 15 stories higher. Please excuse broken nature of report. The kids just told me that as I wrote this the lights have not been seen for about five minutes. Very odd.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
A series of lights moving to fast to be a plane;2003-07-23 22:00:00;10 sec;I didn't know there was a site like this or i would have reported this earlier. reading one of the sightings it sounds very fimilar and it was on the same date as when we saw it...A series of lights moving to fast to be a plane and there was no sound we all saw it and as soon as we looked back into the sky it flew by again and even lower and even faster..don't know what it was but it defanitely wasn't a plane of any sort...and we weren't drinking back there so i know it wasn't our eye's playing tricks.

Five white lights seen in Southern Ontario sky;2005-06-28 03:30:00;10 minutes;Five white lights seen in Southern Ontario sky I first observed 1 bright light in the South East sky above our neighbourhood while looking out my bedroom window. Shortly after I called my brother in to see it 3 more lights had appeared which formed a square with the first light. The top right light became extremely bright and a smaller light of the same brightness then appeared directly to the right of that light. The lights did not move and appeared to hover for aprox. 5 minutes. They did not blink or flash, but the light in the right of the square and the small one beside it gave off an extremely bright white light. The lights were all circular. Then after about 10 minutes since the first light appeared they all vanished at the exact same time.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343

strange bright lights moving and flashing behind the cloud;2007-06-05 21:50:00;20 minutes;strange bright lights moving and flashing behind the cloud I went to pick my kid and his friend around 9:45 p.m. at Queen Elizabeth High School in Mississauga. When I was standing there, suddenly I saw some flashing in the sky.  When I look up in the sky I saw one elongated cloud and around 3 white somewhat round lights were flashing and moving interchanging positions behind that cloud.  It was like white lights size of Full Moon.  Though the day was cloudy on that side of the sky (southeast) only this cloud was there.  It was like if somebody is moving flashlight on the wall or the lights moving on the dance floor.  It was white diffused lights and they were all the time moving exactly behind the cloud and even they reach the edge of the cloud but never seen outside in clear sky.  We were watching it for aroud 20 minutes.  All the time the lights were moving. when cloud size was chaged because of wind or may be some other reason the lights were adjusting the movement according to new boundry of the cloud.  We rule out the possibility of lightening as no sound and the light does not look like lightening at all or it never looked like plane as there were 3 lights moving behind the cloud. We even saw planes coming and going. We observed this at 60-80 degree. For sure it was somewhat strange experience. I am observing sky many times.  Most of the time I am working afternoon shift so while coming home I am used to watch night sky. As we live near the airport we are used to planes in the sky thatswhy I am quite sure that it was not plane.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
Orange lights over mississauga ontario canada;2012-10-07 19:30:00;6 minutes;Orange lights over mississauga ontario canada Was at a store in Mississauga Ontario Canada, when I noticed 3 orange lights in a triangle pattern flying over pearson airport, the flight pattern was west to east these craft were flying north to south, after about a minute the pattern rotated and 2 of the craft went above the cloud line, one continued past me. about 30 seconds after the went out of view I saw another orange light solo same direction, followed by another 3 in a triangle formation, then to past by with no noise, followed again by a single orange light. during this time planes were still landing at pearson west to east.  I took two minute long videos of these formations.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
A dim orange light.;2013-09-25 05:55:00;15 seconds;A dim orange light It was a clear night sky and I was looking at the moon and I saw a very faint orange star move slowing across the sky.  It was going straight from west to east for about 8 seconds and then it did a 90 degree turn to the south for about 3 seconds and then it turned 90 degrees and was heading back west and I lost sight of it.  I thought at first it was a dim meteor, but I know they do not behave this way. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

12 bright oblects in very high altitude, darting around in formation.  Not a satelite.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-19 21:20:00;10 minutes;12 bright oblects in very high altitude, darting around in formation. Not a satelite. Was putting the garbage bins out... being in covid19 lock-down.. the sky is very clear. I'm a frequent flyer, so  can look up and know what aircraft and flight is leaving my local airport.  I also know what the ISS looks like as I've tracked it a few times. Its follows a trajectory.  This was different. I looked up to scan the sky. There was one bright static light... and smaller lights that came across it. You could see them stacked up from the west coming in towards the east. Now I know what a jet liner at 40,000 feet looks like. This was not that.  They came in and circled the brighter object, and then scrambled and went away to come back again. No real pattern... just loops. probably 15 minutes of me muttering WTF and trying to capture a video on my iPhone. But too far away. I grabbed my teenage soon to verify and at first he said.. its a satellite... but then the doubled back and circled. Satellites don't do that. I'm honestly confused as to what I saw?;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343

It was large and made a loud humming noise. i ran to the park as i lost sight of it only to find it was nowhere to be seen. i looked up in the night sky and saw a fleeting ball of light. It moved very fast and became as small as a pinhead of light as it disappeared.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
