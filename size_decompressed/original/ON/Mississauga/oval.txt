FLYING KITE WHEN SILVER DONUT SHAPED OBJECT APPROACHED.;2015-04-28 15:30:00;30 seconds;FLYING KITE WHEN SILVER DONUT SHAPED OBJECT APPROACHED I WAS FLYING MY KITE AT MY PARK THE KITE WAS PRETTY FAR UP THE WIND WAS BLOWING SOUTH   I WAS TRYING TOO UNRAVEL MY STRING FROM KNOTS, WHEN I LOOKED UP AND BEHIND MY KITE WAS A SILVER ROUND DONUT SHAPED OBJECT COMING CLOSER TOO MY KITE! IT WAS SHINY SILVER, AND REFLECTING THE SUN. AS I TURNED TO THE OTHER GUY AT THE PARK AND SAID, HEY, LOOK BEHIND MY KITE, WHAT IS THAT? HE SAID, I DON'T KNOW.  STRANGE, HUH? IT LOOKED LIKE A SILVER INNER TUBE BUT THERE'S NO STORES THAT SELL SILVER INNER TUBES.  IT APPEARED TO BE CURIOUS ABOUT MY KITE.  MY KITE DETAILS ARE A DIAMOND SHAPE DELTA SUPERMAN SYMBOL. ALSO THE WIND WAS BLOWING SOUTH.  THIS INNER TUBE/DONUT SILVER OBJECT WAS APPROACHING MY KITE IN THE SKY, HEADING NORTH TOWARDS MY KITE.  IF SOMEONE PLAYED A TRICK AND PUT A HELIUM SILVER INNER TUBE AND LET IT GO TO FLOAT AWAY, THEN IT WOULD NOT APPROACH A KITE WHEN THE WIND IS BLOWING SOUTH!  IT WOULD JUST KEEP  HEADING SOUTH AND UP. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the time to p.m..  We suspect the witness was not flying a kite at 03:30 hrs., i.e. 3:30 a.m., as he indicated in his original report.  We have edited the report extensively, to make it understandable.  PD));43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
