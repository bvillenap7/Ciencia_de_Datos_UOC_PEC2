Incredibly close sighting in broad daylight.;1984-06-01 13:00:00;1 miniute;Incredibly close sighting in broad daylight. I am not sure of the year although it was sometime in the early 80's. I wish I had reported this then or made notes. Maybe this is the time? We were at a friends apartment in Mississauga near the QEW and Erin Mills Parkway. It was summer time in the afternoon. The skies were blue with little or no clouds. The apartment was fairly high up. 7-10 floors facing north. I was inside when my friends start to yell. I ran to the balcony. Standing on the balcony looking north, the Credit River to our right, runs from Lake Ontario behind us, north. In the distance we can see Erindale University. There Credit River forms a natural green belt. Not more than 2km's to our right, hovering slowly and quietly south down the Credit River about 500m above the ground was a saucer or disk shaped object (craft). There were no lights. I remember distinctly that it looked weathered. Rusty, brown, black. It looked like it had been exposed to the elements. I would estimate that it would have been 200m from end to end. Fairly low profile compared to the size.  The craft continued to slowly hover south for approximately 45 seconds. It was hard to tell if it was spinning. It then stop for 15 seconds. It rose instantly about 500-1000m straight up. Stop briefly then appeared to take off south and vanish again silently. I do not believe any of my friends that were there that day ever reported their sightings. I looked for other reports in the papers for a couple of weeks, but never read or heard of another sighting of this object. This experience has effected the way that I live my life.

I saw coloured lights in the sky outside through my window when I woke up at 5:30am;2004-07-26 05:25:00;20 mins;I saw coloured lights in the sky outside through my window when I woke up at 5:30am There was 1 bright white light in the middle of the craft.  There was also another circle of white lights surounding the bright light.  Then there was another circle of coloured lights around the other circle.  The coloured lights stopped after a few mins.  After about 10 mins there was a flash of green light and then purple light.  After the flashes the lights started to fade away.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
Silver disk flying in distance, seen from Mississauga school yard;2006-04-07 12:30:00;10-15 Seconds;Silver disk flying in distance, seen from Mississauga school yard From my school's yard, where there must've been more than 100 people, but they did not pay as much attention to the sky as I did, and may have took the ufo as a plane..  The ufo was silver and never made any sounds, and if it was a plane, then I would have heard a sharp noise, but I didn't. It was far in the distance and was faster than a plane, and much more silent, no noises. It looked like shiny dark silver, was hovering in high altitude and was completely silent, it was flying at a high speed, as if it was flying faster than a plane in the same hight above ground.  The disk was more sharp looking than a plain one, kind of like it had another part to it rather than a disk as whole. It flashed a sun like light once and another after a few seconds again, then when my friend caught my attention, I looked back but it was gone.  The school yard had more than 100 people on it, there was 2 basketball courts on the left side where people played, there was trees on the left side around the corner of the school, there were houses infront of my followed by a forest like area, and the sky was mostly sunny and clear with only a few light, thin clouds.  The shape was a disk, kind of like a cigar, but looked more like a disk, and like there was some type of other parts to it sticking from the sides, it was silver, and shiny. It flashed lights 2 times. It hovered over in the distance, from right to left, and then disappeared. There was only 1 of them. It didn't make any sound, and was silent the whole time. It was going at a faster speed than an airplane, and smoother, plus there wasn't any type of trace of fuel coming out the back, such as the while gas/line an airplane leaves in the sky, but this object didn't leave a trail such as that.
