We were looking at the sky, looking south.  A huge, black triangle appeared before us just over the roof of the neighbour south of us. We both saw it, both screeching, What is that?  It was so low and so big.  We could see orange light bulbs in lines down the two sides.  It was completely silent and had NO exhaust.  Had there been exhaust, I would have been able to see it.   I thought immediately that it was atomic powered.  It was not gliding. It passed slowly, with an even speed, and in a straight line.  The little orange lights looked vaguely comical. I got up and ran out to the front of the house to follow it but it went over the neighbour`s house and quickly was out of sight.  There was no way to follow it as it passed on an angle to the streets.   I called the UFO hotline in Toronto.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343

As i said above they entered from my right i was facing east and they flew from the south to the north at a amazing speed as they reached the north section of the sky they changed formation and made a turn to the east like i have never witnessed before.There height just below the cloud line 3000 feet broken. The above took place in very small time frame with no engine sound the only reason i noticed these ufos was the fact i just happened to be looking up as they came into view or they would have passed with out my knowledge. What ever these craft were the flight performace was better than display at any airshow .;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343

It was 2.00am last night a storm had rolled through Mississauga and then on over Toronto. My sons called me to their bedroom to see what they said were weird lights in the sky over the lake. What I witnessed at first was a series of lights on the clouds which at first I took to be spot lights from the ground illuminating the clouds a not uncommon experience. My opinion of this changed when one of the twisting rotating lights in the clouds suddenly got to the edge of the cloud, when it did it was brighter than the sun to look at. This went on for over an hour with the lights wiggling and constantly appearing at the edge of the cloud as these immensely bright spots of light. A second storm was rolling in from the west behind us, there were some huge flashes of lightning inside the clouds which of course illuminated the entire sky as these took place it was obvious that there was a very large triangular object in the clouds, the repeated flashes and the blocking of light (shadow) that this thing caused made it obvious that it was indeed solid. From one flash to the next it had moved horizontally and had got smaller indicating that it was higher. After about 6 or 7 lightning flashes it was no longer visible. I went back to looking at the lights spinning through the sky above the lake. They started to slow down and remain in one place but always glowing, there was a sort of illuminated grid pattern (hard to explain) but like a rectangle with square dull lights in a grid pattern like a an old fashioned multipaned window is as best as I can describe it. This was evident for only a matter of seconds, when it disappeared the lights started squiggling in a sinuous manner, this they would do as they darted across the top of the clouds, constantly they would appear at the edge of the cloud and sparkle from blue white to an intense amber colour. I left to answer the call of nature, when I came back only one light remained, constantly lit and very bri! ght. The others had (this according to my two adult sons) moved in a wobbling and sinusoidal way out of sight to the south west. The last light remained in place very bright for over ten minutes, it then moved up into the clouds getting fainter until it completely disappeared. I am aware that alot of folks will think that we observed a simple thunderstorm, what we saw has nothing to do with any storm. It was remote from it, intelligent and from what we saw obviously solid in nature. I have seen some of these things many times now, and I am becoming convinced that there is some form of intelligent control of this phenomena. Our vantage point to see this event is a 15th floor apartment very near the lake, our view goes from the WSW all the way to ESE plus a little bit.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
Triangular lights spinning slowly over a park and rising at a low angle.;2002-08-09 21:20:00;4 seconds;Triangular lights spinning slowly over a park and rising at a low angle. This happened around 9:20 pm on Firday, August 9th, 2002.  I was biking in a new park with my cousin.  It was dark, and no trees obscured the sky.  Some stars where visible but very faintly.  One plane was also observed, it appeared to be a passanger jet with clearly visible light beacons.  When my cousin and I where close to a local school we both saw a peculiar three light triangular configuration in the sky,  extremely low to the ground.  I would say about 15 - 25 meters above the ground.  The lights where clearly visible and definately not faint.  They could not be mistaked for an airplane or stars.  They where roundish white and a little yellowish.  The lights gave an impression of a very large triangular object.  The lights where about 30 meters from us when they slowly begun spinning and rising at the same time at a low angle.  They gave an impression as if the object in the sky was very slow and heavy.  The lights then accelerated as they where rising and completely disappeared. There was absolutely no sound heard throughout the event.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343

Triangular light formation above Lake Ontario merges into one and shoots across the sky.;2013-09-14 04:43:00;10 minutes;Triangular light formation above Lake Ontario merges into one and shoots across the sky. I had just finished watching a movie, and I went out on my balcony for a cigarette at around 4am.  There were these three bright lights in the sky in the shape of a triangle over above Lake Ontario.   So I took a photo.  They were bright enough to appear in the photo, while other stars/planes that were in the sky when I took the picture didn't show up in it.  I figured they were just a weird formation of stars, but by the time my cigarette was almost finished, they suddenly combined into one and just shot across the sky.  The lights seemed to have been changing colour between red, blue, and white.  Although it may have just been because they were so far away and so bright.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
