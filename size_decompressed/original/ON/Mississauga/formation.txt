Three dull orange lights in a straight line formation varying in distance from each other .;2004-09-23 21:40:00;6 sec;Three dull orange lights in a straight line formation varying in distance from each other . Three dull orange lights of constant luminescence each the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length, in a more or less straight line formation. The formation was at an angle of between 10 to 30 degrees off the line of travel, varying that angle over the duration of the sighting.Formation length was about the length of observers  thumb as seen at arms length. Line of travel was from the north west to the south east. This corresponds to the direction from toronto int'l airport to lake ontario. There are many aircraft in the air space in the duration of the day where observation took place. None take this flight path. There was no sound coming from the formation, at least not audible by the observer. Sky was clear with no wind. Light of formation could have been the reflection caused by city street lighting, if the object(s)were of a reflective material such as polished aluminum. Observer watches night/day sky often and has come to know the difference between known aircraft or birds and for example this observation. It was not the first time. People look up at the sky, you'll be amazed.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
About 10 burning torches flying above Mississauga, low speed, in formation;2012-11-22 09:58:00;5 minutes;About 10 burning torches flying above Mississauga, low speed, in formation I saw about 10 objects in the sky. They were moving from SW to NE, at a speed lower then airplanes, but at a steady speed. They did not have green/blue flashing lights. Every object looked like a torch. Like a flying, burning flame. The colour of each of them was like fire (orange/red/yellow). They moved in formation, most of them with 3 of them together, but some were alone. As I could see they moved at the same height. I could not see if it was more than a flame, because it was dark.  I only saw the flames (I did not see shapes of airplanes or something). I was in the car, but stopped and opened my window and could not hear any sound from them, it was like they were quiet. At every moment they looked the same, when they were approaching me, when they were above me and when they were moving away from me.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
